WEBVTT

20:22.332 --> 20:28.332
Today is a great day of Navaratri,

20:29.332 --> 20:34.832
we are sitting on the cusp of the sixth and the seventh.

20:34.832 --> 20:43.832
Sixth and the seventh is the day when Mahasaraswati

20:43.832 --> 20:48.832
finished Her work

20:48.832 --> 20:53.832
and the incarnation of the Shakti itself started.

20:53.832 --> 20:59.332
So, at twelve o’clock today the Devi takes the Shakti upon Herself.

20:59.332 --> 21:08.332
Of course, as you know that Mahakali and Mahasaraswati,

21:08.332 --> 21:20.332
both are the powers of Shri Sadashiva.

21:20.332 --> 21:28.332
Adi Shakti first formed Herself into Mahakali,

21:28.332 --> 21:33.332
which is the Power of Desire.

21:33.332 --> 21:38.332
But all these powers are nothing

21:38.332 --> 21:45.332
but the power of God’s love.

21:45.332 --> 21:56.332
So, in the series of this great love of God,

21:56.332 --> 22:02.332
Adi Shakti had to first become the Power of Desire.

22:02.332 --> 22:03.332
In the same way,

22:03.332 --> 22:08.332
Sahaja Yogis who are bestowed with this power of love

22:08.332 --> 22:13.332
have to have full desire in their heart.

22:13.332 --> 22:20.332
Desire to love.

22:20.332 --> 22:27.332
That desire is very different from

22:27.332 --> 22:32.332
the other kinds of human love we have known.

22:32.332 --> 22:36.332
In other kinds of human love,

22:36.332 --> 22:39.332
when we have relations with others,

22:39.332 --> 22:43.332
we have expectations,

22:44.332 --> 22:49.332
and that’s why it is very disappointing.

22:49.332 --> 22:53.332
Our expectations always run higher

22:53.332 --> 22:59.332
than our understanding and realities.

22:59.332 --> 23:04.332
And so we suffer from disappointments and frustrations.

23:04.332 --> 23:10.832
And the love that has to be nourishing and fulfilling

23:10.832 --> 23:14.832
becomes a thankless job.

23:14.832 --> 23:19.832
So, when it reflects in the human beings,

23:19.832 --> 23:24.832
it is the desire to be loved by everyone,

23:24.832 --> 23:28.832
not to love others.

23:28.832 --> 23:31.832
Everyone should love you,

23:31.832 --> 23:35.832
but how far you love another is the point.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.832
Naturally everyone for oneself!

23:38.832 --> 23:41.832
So really nobody loves.

23:41.832 --> 23:46.832
But when it comes to real love

23:46.832 --> 23:52.832
then sacrifice becomes a nature.

23:52.832 --> 23:56.832
You don’t call it a sacrifice but you call it a privilege.

23:56.832 --> 24:01.832
We say it’s a privilege to give love.

24:01.832 --> 24:06.832
It’s a great chance that we can love.

24:06.832 --> 24:11.832
It’s our great fortune that we can love.

24:11.832 --> 24:16.832
It’s God’s blessings that we can love and give.

24:16.832 --> 24:22.832
So the giving starts when you realise,

24:22.832 --> 24:26.832
not understand but realise the love,

24:26.832 --> 24:30.832
the power of love expressing .

24:30.832 --> 24:34.832
That’s the third power, which starts expressing .

24:34.832 --> 24:36.832
Because, after this,

24:36.832 --> 24:40.832
a person becomes active, kriyasheet.

24:40.832 --> 24:44.832
That’s how the action of

24:44.832 --> 24:49.832
achieving that state of giving love starts.

24:49.832 --> 24:53.832
To begin with we start activating in so many ways.

24:53.832 --> 24:59.832
As I said, we start expecting

24:59.832 --> 25:06.832
and thinking that we are loving others.

25:06.832 --> 25:10.832
We act for that.

25:10.832 --> 25:14.832
In that madness that others should love us,

25:14.832 --> 25:16.832
others should respect us,

25:16.832 --> 25:18.832
others should think we are great,

25:18.832 --> 25:20.832
they should recognise us

25:20.832 --> 25:25.832
we start loving something else which is not so important.

25:25.832 --> 25:30.832
So, we go on first to money,

25:30.832 --> 25:33.832
money becomes a very important point.

25:33.832 --> 25:39.832
We think that, if we have money, people will love us.

25:39.832 --> 25:43.832
We become very powerful as moneyed people,

25:43.832 --> 25:46.832
as rich people.

25:46.832 --> 25:48.832
So we start accumulating money,

25:48.832 --> 25:55.832
we start loving the money.

25:55.832 --> 25:58.832
But money is not the Truth;

25:58.832 --> 26:00.832
we don’t love the Truth.

26:00.832 --> 26:03.832
When we start loving the money

26:03.832 --> 26:06.832
we start thinking about problems of money.

26:06.832 --> 26:14.832
Such people can become miserly to such an extent

26:14.832 --> 26:17.832
that even towards God they become miserly.

26:17.832 --> 26:18.832
They never have money actually,

26:18.832 --> 26:21.832
because if you cannot spend your money, you have no money.

26:21.832 --> 26:26.832
If it is not available what’s the use of having all the money?

26:26.832 --> 26:29.832
That’s how they have problems

26:29.832 --> 26:36.832
because they love money and not the God Almighty.

26:36.832 --> 26:42.832
They’re worried about money but not about the Truth.

26:42.832 --> 26:47.832
Then with that they go to a second thing: is the power.

26:47.832 --> 26:50.832
They want to have the power;

26:50.832 --> 26:52.832
they want to become presidents,

26:52.982 --> 26:57.832
ministers and bureaucrats and all that.

26:57.832 --> 27:00.832
They want to have the power:

27:00.832 --> 27:03.832
they think by having great power

27:03.832 --> 27:05.832
people will respect them and love them.

27:05.832 --> 27:10.832
But they get drowned in fear.

27:10.832 --> 27:14.832
What they get is fear. All the time they have fear.

27:14.832 --> 27:17.832
Also moneyed people have fear.

27:17.832 --> 27:23.832
That’s why in the Bible it is said that: wages of sin is fear.

27:23.832 --> 27:28.832
What is sin? Sin is not to love the Truth.

27:28.832 --> 27:32.832
Is the sin. When you don’t love the Truth then it is sin.

27:32.832 --> 27:38.832
So when you start getting worried about your positions…

27:38.832 --> 27:44.832
Like the president feels that he’ll lose his job,

27:44.832 --> 27:51.832
the vice president thinks that he’ll be sacked,

27:51.832 --> 27:56.832
the prime minister thinks he may not be elected,

27:56.832 --> 28:00.832
the bureaucrats think they will lose their jobs,

28:00.832 --> 28:02.832
they won’t get promotions or something,

28:02.832 --> 28:04.832
there will be problem.

28:04.832 --> 28:08.832
All these people are suffering from terrible sense of fear.

28:08.832 --> 28:11.832
They have no freedom of any kind.

28:11.832 --> 28:16.832
And in that category people just go down so much with fear,

28:16.832 --> 28:20.832
that even worse than people with money.

28:20.832 --> 28:23.832
Because once they are lost they are lost.

28:23.832 --> 28:27.832
They can never revive. No chance.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.832
Once you lose the elections you are lost,

28:29.832 --> 28:30.832
nobody is going to look at you.

28:30.832 --> 28:34.832
I have known people who have been at a very high position

28:34.832 --> 28:39.832
and once they lose that position nobody looks at them,

28:39.832 --> 28:40.832
they just walk like straight,

28:40.832 --> 28:44.832
otherwise there will be at least hundred cars to receive them.

28:44.832 --> 28:48.832
And once they lose their jobs there’s nobody even to look at them.

28:48.832 --> 28:51.832
They just walk like ordinary people.

28:51.832 --> 28:54.832
Even seeing all these things happening,

28:54.832 --> 29:00.832
this truth just coming before them so clearly,

29:00.832 --> 29:04.832
they do not keep to that truth,

29:04.832 --> 29:07.832
they do not realise that truth,

29:07.832 --> 29:13.832
they do not have that realisation within them.

29:13.832 --> 29:18.832
They understand for a while and they go after that.

29:18.832 --> 29:21.832
Then when the person dies,

29:21.832 --> 29:27.832
they see a moneyed man, a rich man is forgotten,

29:27.832 --> 29:31.832
nobody is bothered about them, who was a rich man.

29:31.832 --> 29:33.832
On the contrary, the people,

29:33.832 --> 29:37.832
the prime ministers and all those high ranking people, when they die,

29:37.832 --> 29:41.832
immediately books start coming out about their private life:

29:41.832 --> 29:45.832
all the dirty things they did

29:45.832 --> 29:50.832
and all the horrible things they did and what sort of life they led

29:50.832 --> 29:52.832
There’s no fragrance in their life,

29:52.832 --> 29:56.832
no idealism. Nothing.

29:56.832 --> 29:59.832
Because the responsibility

29:59.832 --> 30:02.832
that they have to the public

30:02.832 --> 30:06.832
and to themselves they have not understood it

30:06.832 --> 30:09.832
and they made a mess of their private life.

30:09.832 --> 30:15.832
That’s why this kind of a reaction comes after it.

30:15.832 --> 30:18.832
The other day I was reading

30:18.832 --> 30:22.832
an interview with a very well known actor.

30:22.832 --> 30:26.832
He’s a born-realised fellow, I know, but he’s gone down completely.

30:26.832 --> 30:29.832
He says, “I think, what’s the harm in drinking,

30:29.832 --> 30:31.832
what’s the harm in gambling,?

30:31.832 --> 30:33.832
what’s the harm in smoking?

30:33.832 --> 30:37.832
Because, after all, I’m going to die

30:37.832 --> 30:42.832
and then who is going to bother?

30:42.832 --> 30:44.832
Supposing, I get cancer, so what?

30:44.832 --> 30:46.832
In any case I’m going to die.

30:46.832 --> 30:49.532
So why not enjoy these pleasures of life?”

30:49.532 --> 30:55.532
But what about death? You continue with it.

30:55.532 --> 30:59.532
Then all that you’ve been doing will come out,

30:59.532 --> 31:05.532
and people will not to like to have your photograph in the household.

31:05.532 --> 31:08.532
Children will spit at you. What about that?

31:08.532 --> 31:13.532
Your life is not what it is today for three, four years or ten years

31:13.532 --> 31:16.532
or fifteen years of your so-called success.

31:16.532 --> 31:18.532
But when you die

31:18.532 --> 31:22.532
all this craziness will disappear

31:22.532 --> 31:26.532
and people will come out with truth about you.

31:26.532 --> 31:32.532
That is how this power to be popular finishes off.

31:32.532 --> 31:36.532
This cheap popularity,

31:36.532 --> 31:44.532
this cheap type of treatment towards yourself

31:44.532 --> 31:50.532
gives you a personality that will not be worshipped,

31:50.532 --> 31:53.532
that will not be accepted.

31:53.532 --> 31:56.532
Nobody will quote you as something great.

31:56.532 --> 31:58.532
For some time it will continue,

31:58.532 --> 32:04.532
but in totality such a person has given nothing to humanity.

32:04.532 --> 32:11.532
That’s how the power of Saraswati works.

32:11.532 --> 32:13.532
People go into action

32:13.532 --> 32:22.532
for achieving the results of getting into power.

32:22.532 --> 32:28.532
But it should act to discover the truth.

32:28.532 --> 32:38.532
Saraswati should give you the leap to find out the truth.

32:38.532 --> 32:45.532
That, when you act in those funny places and streets,

32:45.532 --> 32:48.532
you discover this is not the path, we have missed it.

32:48.532 --> 32:53.532
The path is somewhere else. We’ve lost it.

32:53.532 --> 32:56.532
Let us find out the real path because this doesn’t give joy.

32:56.532 --> 32:58.532
This one can learn from others,

32:58.532 --> 33:03.532
from history, from so many other things and from your own parents,

33:03.532 --> 33:09.532
from your society and from yourself and from your children also.

33:09.532 --> 33:11.532
If you want to learn,

33:11.532 --> 33:15.532
that is the quality of Saraswati pujaris,

33:15.532 --> 33:20.532
that they take to gyana, they take to reality.

33:20.532 --> 33:23.532
Vedas, in the beginning of the Vedas,

33:23.532 --> 33:25.532
it’s said that:

33:25.532 --> 33:29.532
if by reading these four Vedas,

33:29.532 --> 33:33.532
if you do not get the veeda,

33:33.532 --> 33:38.532
veeda is the knowledge on your nerves, means Realisation,

33:38.532 --> 33:47.532
there is no use reading these Vedas.

33:47.532 --> 33:55.532
So the Saraswati’s first thing is that through the reading,

33:55.532 --> 34:00.532
through the process of Saraswati’s manifestation,

34:00.532 --> 34:05.532
you must reach a point to understand that this is a rat-race

34:05.532 --> 34:06.532
and we have to get out of it.

34:06.532 --> 34:08.532
We have to step out.

34:08.532 --> 34:10.532
When that happens,

34:10.532 --> 34:13.532
then the Mahalakshmi Tattwa starts working in you,

34:13.532 --> 34:18.532
that is the third tattwa, which starts working.

34:23.532 --> 34:25.532
Mahalakshmi Tattwa

34:25.532 --> 34:30.532
then starts expressing its love in its full extent

34:30.532 --> 34:35.532
through evolutionary process in human beings.

34:35.532 --> 34:39.532
He starts evolving simultaneously.

34:39.532 --> 34:43.532
He sees on both the sides what’s happening,

34:43.532 --> 34:51.532
like a witness and he uses his Mahalakshmi power.

34:51.532 --> 34:55.532
In the first part of the Mahalakshmi power

34:55.532 --> 35:03.532
he starts getting out of the common rut of the family bondages

35:03.532 --> 35:11.532
and the other human bondages of power,

35:11.532 --> 35:14.532
money, lust

35:14.532 --> 35:19.532
and he starts moving on a higher plane.

35:19.532 --> 35:27.532
He gives us a new idea of popularity

35:27.532 --> 35:32.532
by establishing the Truth.

35:32.532 --> 35:35.532
Because through Mahalakshmi power

35:35.532 --> 35:41.532
you discover the Truth on your central nervous system

35:41.532 --> 35:52.532
and ultimately it is the light of an enlightened brain.

35:55.532 --> 36:00.532
When the Mahalakshmi power starts manifesting,

36:00.532 --> 36:05.532
one starts thinking of others.

36:05.532 --> 36:08.532
Not on material level,

36:08.532 --> 36:10.532
that materially people are suffering,

36:10.532 --> 36:13.532
“Now there are people in Ethiopia, who will save?

36:13.532 --> 36:15.532
We must give them some food, this, that.

36:15.532 --> 36:21.532
” No! They go to the roots of the problems. Why?

36:21.532 --> 36:23.532
Or they don’t think there should be

36:23.532 --> 36:26.532
equal distribution of money and wealth.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.532
No. This is superficial.

36:29.532 --> 36:36.532
Because wherever it is done people are not happy.

36:37.532 --> 36:41.532
They feel they have no freedom.

36:43.532 --> 36:46.532
Those people who have money are not happy

36:46.532 --> 36:51.532
because they have a demonic life.

36:51.532 --> 36:55.532
Where they are free they behave like devils.

36:55.532 --> 36:57.532
No sense of totality,

36:57.532 --> 37:00.532
no sense of collectivity.

37:00.532 --> 37:04.532
When they become like that,

37:08.532 --> 37:14.532
they even do not realise that they have become demonic.

37:14.532 --> 37:20.532
Everything becomes like a big martyrdom.

37:21.532 --> 37:23.532
They fight for lands,

37:23.532 --> 37:25.532
they fight for nations,

37:25.532 --> 37:29.532
they fight for rights.

37:29.532 --> 37:32.532
And they do all kinds of horrible things.

37:32.532 --> 37:39.532
Start destroying people, human beings.

37:39.532 --> 37:44.532
All the turmoil of today is the effect of

37:45.532 --> 37:47.532
mostly in the West,

37:47.532 --> 37:51.532
and also all the Arabic countries,

37:51.532 --> 37:55.532
I would say – is of the right side.

37:56.532 --> 38:02.532
And in the East it is of the left side, the turmoils.

38:02.532 --> 38:07.532
It’s very surprising that

38:07.532 --> 38:09.532
it’s very contrasting also.

38:09.532 --> 38:11.532
It’s a funny dilemma for Me,

38:11.532 --> 38:14.532
I can’t understand it sometimes

38:14.532 --> 38:18.532
that where they are so particular about the chastity,

38:23.532 --> 38:30.532
they become when they are so much worried about chastity and everything,

38:30.532 --> 38:33.532
that they should have problem of the left side.

38:33.532 --> 38:36.532
They do puja, they have shraddha,

38:36.532 --> 38:38.532
they are like Catholics, we can say,

38:38.532 --> 38:39.532
are never rich people,

38:39.532 --> 38:44.532
seldom, except in Switzerland,

38:44.532 --> 38:46.532
I think, here everybody’s rich

38:47.532 --> 38:50.532
because they are so money-oriented.

38:53.532 --> 38:58.532
So, or the people where they are right sided,

39:00.532 --> 39:03.532
when they neglect their chastity,

39:05.532 --> 39:08.532
not bothered about the right side,

39:09.532 --> 39:13.532
they have the problems of the right side,

39:15.532 --> 39:17.532
is very surprising.

39:18.532 --> 39:23.532
The reason is where they look after the chastity part

39:24.532 --> 39:27.532
they go too much into it.

39:30.532 --> 39:35.532
Now, supposing a person is doing a puja.

39:37.532 --> 39:41.532
He just goes on doing puja, puja, puja morning till evening,

39:41.532 --> 39:43.532
without any activity.

39:43.532 --> 39:45.532
Very easy to do puja, isn’t it?

39:45.532 --> 39:47.532
Just come down,

39:47.532 --> 39:49.532
somebody does puja for you, get the vibrations,

39:49.532 --> 39:51.532
nicely blessed, go home.

39:51.532 --> 39:52.532
Nothing to be done,

39:53.532 --> 39:55.532
no activity.

39:56.532 --> 39:59.532
So there is no balance.

39:59.532 --> 40:04.532
So they do puja and they think, “Oh, they have done very well.”

40:04.532 --> 40:07.532
No, if you are a right sided person,

40:08.532 --> 40:10.532
then puja will help you,

40:10.532 --> 40:12.532
but not if you are a left sided person.

40:17.532 --> 40:19.532
Puja does help,

40:19.532 --> 40:21.532
of course, My Puja will help, no doubt,

40:21.532 --> 40:22.532
in both the sides,

40:22.532 --> 40:26.532
because I’m neither left nor right nor anywhere.

40:38.532 --> 40:42.532
So the puja part when they do …

40:42.532 --> 40:48.532
supposing a man is doing a puja to a Devi.

40:48.532 --> 40:54.532
In India they take a great courage to do puja to a Devi,

40:54.532 --> 40:55.532
you do not know that.

40:55.532 --> 40:57.532
Saptashati. That’s where we have

40:57.532 --> 40:59.532
that thing that the way people do,

40:59.532 --> 41:01.532
they get possessed,

41:01.532 --> 41:02.532
they can’t understand.

41:02.532 --> 41:05.532
First of all they have a statue of someone

41:05.532 --> 41:07.532
made by some horrible fellow.

41:07.532 --> 41:10.532
When they will do the puja of that Goddess,

41:10.532 --> 41:12.532
they are God-fearing,

41:12.532 --> 41:14.532
everything is good,

41:14.532 --> 41:18.532
we have got temples where there are also,

41:18.532 --> 41:21.532
we can say, swayambhus

41:23.532 --> 41:25.532
from the Mother Earth,

41:25.532 --> 41:27.532
which are worshipped

41:27.532 --> 41:28.532
and should be all right,

41:28.532 --> 41:31.532
but no, they get possessed. Why?

41:32.532 --> 41:34.532
Because most of them,

41:34.532 --> 41:40.532
these temples are hounded by or haunted by spirits.

41:40.532 --> 41:43.532
Because they do all kinds of tantaric things there.

41:43.532 --> 41:46.532
And when people go and do the pujas there

41:46.532 --> 41:49.532
what happens to them?

41:49.532 --> 41:52.532
That they get attacked,

41:54.532 --> 41:56.532
they become more left sided.

41:58.532 --> 42:02.532
Now the Muslims and others who believe in a God

42:02.532 --> 42:03.532
which is neerakara,

42:03.532 --> 42:05.532
which is formless,

42:08.532 --> 42:10.532
they go to the right side.

42:10.532 --> 42:12.532
There’s formless God,

42:12.532 --> 42:14.532
it’s nice, formless everywhere is God,

42:14.532 --> 42:17.532
in Me, in you, everyone there is God,

42:17.532 --> 42:19.532
everybody’s God.

42:19.532 --> 42:22.532
Even if you are a devil, you are God.

42:23.532 --> 42:25.532
There’s nothing wrong with anyone,

42:25.532 --> 42:27.532
everybody’s God,

42:27.532 --> 42:29.532
starts on that principle.

42:32.532 --> 42:35.532
So they go onto supraconscious side

42:35.532 --> 42:38.532
and they become demonic.

42:41.532 --> 42:43.532
Then they must fight,

42:43.532 --> 42:44.532
because they are devils. Devils have to fight,

42:44.532 --> 42:47.532
otherwise how will they exist?

42:49.532 --> 42:52.532
They fight, they aggress,

42:52.532 --> 42:54.532
they go to other countries,

42:55.532 --> 42:57.532
aggress them, capture them,

42:57.532 --> 43:00.532
all the time they are thinking of aggressing others.

43:00.532 --> 43:02.532
In a subtler way they aggress,

43:02.532 --> 43:05.532
nowadays the media is aggressive in the West.

43:07.532 --> 43:09.532
There are so many ways of aggression

43:09.532 --> 43:15.532
and to them aggression is something is very dharmic.

43:15.532 --> 43:17.532
For anything.

43:17.532 --> 43:20.532
They’ll ask direct questions,

43:20.532 --> 43:26.532
arrogant, insulting and cruel,

43:28.532 --> 43:29.532
they become cruel.

43:33.532 --> 43:35.532
That’s how the turmoil starts

43:35.532 --> 43:38.532
when we start using the power of Saraswati

43:38.532 --> 43:41.532
in a wrong way or the power of Mahakali.

43:47.532 --> 43:51.532
That’s why in Sahaja Yoga before the Puja

43:51.532 --> 43:53.532
we have to go into lot of activity.

43:53.532 --> 43:55.532
You have to decorate the hall,

43:55.532 --> 43:58.532
you have to get the flowers,

43:58.532 --> 44:01.532
you have to organize everything beautifully.

44:02.532 --> 44:05.532
Look at the roses, how beautiful they are.

44:05.532 --> 44:08.532
Then you starts balancing yourself

44:08.532 --> 44:11.532
with all these activities you do.

44:16.532 --> 44:19.532
And then you sit down for puja.

44:19.532 --> 44:22.532
That’s like in the daytime you work,

44:22.532 --> 44:23.532
in the night you sleep.

44:25.532 --> 44:28.532
To rest, to get the place you must be active.

44:31.532 --> 44:33.532
Like they have to climb Himalayas

44:33.532 --> 44:36.532
to achieve meditation.

44:37.532 --> 44:39.532
Because when you are tired,

44:39.532 --> 44:43.532
you can be restful afterwards.

44:43.532 --> 44:45.532
Otherwise, if you get somebody,

44:45.532 --> 44:47.532
say, from Switzerland only,

44:47.532 --> 44:53.532
the very speedy person for meditation,

44:53.532 --> 44:56.532
you’ll have to put the glue on him

44:57.532 --> 45:00.532
to settle down because he’ll be frantic, you know,

45:00.532 --> 45:04.532
all the time. Will be all the time jumping.

45:09.532 --> 45:16.532
So the activity has to come before the puja

45:18.532 --> 45:20.532
and the balance has to be established.

45:20.532 --> 45:23.532
So the ladies have to find out the saris

45:23.532 --> 45:25.532
and the blouses and this and that

45:25.532 --> 45:27.532
and they have to worry about putting the flowers,

45:27.532 --> 45:30.532
arranging things, this, that. Lot of activities!

45:32.532 --> 45:34.532
We have to travel.

45:34.532 --> 45:37.532
For English it was necessary to travel all the way from England,

45:37.532 --> 45:40.532
to arrange their money and rooms and everything to come here,

45:42.532 --> 45:47.532
to go to futuristic side, to think what they are going to pay,

45:47.532 --> 45:50.532
how they are going to pay back their loans!

45:54.532 --> 46:00.532
All this futuristic planning they have to do before they come to Switzerland.

46:02.532 --> 46:09.532
Switzerland being the most active place, it’s better to have the puja here, so they are not so much active!

46:11.532 --> 46:14.532
That’s how the Devi arranges everything.

46:17.532 --> 46:21.532
So the ascent starts evolving.

46:23.532 --> 46:30.532
In that, the play of the Devi is the Navaratri – in your ascent – from ages.

46:30.532 --> 46:35.532
Navaratri that’s why is the most important Puja.

46:36.532 --> 46:41.532
.In Sahaja Yoga, Navaratri is the most important puja

46:41.532 --> 46:48.532
Though we can say in modern Sahaja Yoga Sahastrar Day is, because that’s how you started getting your Realisation.

46:48.532 --> 46:53.532
But if you go to the whole historical events of evolution

46:54.532 --> 47:02.532
you’ll find [that] Navaratri is the one which has brought you to Sahastrara.

47:02.532 --> 47:07.532
Without the help of the Devi at different stages of your ascent,

47:07.532 --> 47:13.532
you could not have been in a position to receive your Realisation.

47:13.532 --> 47:19.532
So all the steps that you took in the past are today worshipped

47:20.532 --> 47:28.532
and are used for thanking the Devi for what She did to bring you down here.

47:28.532 --> 47:29.532
So it’s like a thanksgiving.

47:30.532 --> 47:35.532
Without Her work nothing could have happened.

47:35.532 --> 47:39.532
So when we read about the Devi, about Her incarnations:

47:39.532 --> 47:43.532
how She came on this Earth to save Her bhaktas,

47:43.532 --> 47:52.532
people who were trying to ascend, to cross this bhavasagara,

47:53.532 --> 47:56.532
how She worked hard,

47:56.532 --> 47:59.532
how she fought the devils,

47:59.532 --> 48:05.532
how She fought, She killed the demons single-handed,

48:06.532 --> 48:12.532
She took upon Herself the responsibility of making the people cross the bhavasagara.

48:13.532 --> 48:18.532
Guru gave you the strength to have dharma but She is the one who brought you out.

48:18.532 --> 48:22.532
Even those who were dharmic could not do it because of the demonic pressure.

48:23.532 --> 48:29.532
She’s the one who fought single-handed with Her powers of destruction.

48:30.532 --> 48:33.532
In Her love for you She fought.

48:33.532 --> 48:35.532
She brought you to this level.

48:35.532 --> 48:40.532
And then She took a milder form of incarnation.

48:41.532 --> 48:44.532
Even during the time of all the gurus

48:44.532 --> 48:54.532
She took the form of, as you know, Janaki was the daughter of Janaka,

48:54.532 --> 49:01.532
then Fatima was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib

49:01.532 --> 49:04.532
and Nanaki was the sister of Nanaka.

49:04.532 --> 49:17.532
In those forms, these Powers sustained and nourished the Guru Tattwa.

49:17.532 --> 49:24.532
And later on, or sometimes simultaneously,

49:26.532 --> 49:36.532
They incarnated in milder forms to help human beings to rise.

49:36.532 --> 49:39.532
So today is the day of thanksgiving.

49:39.864 --> 49:43.864
As Guru Puja is a day of thanksgiving to your Guru,

49:44.532 --> 49:46.532
the One who has counselled you,

49:46.532 --> 49:50.532
the One who has told you about the Truth,

49:50.532 --> 49:57.532
the One who has taught you the Truth and has given you Realisation.

49:58.532 --> 50:03.532
And the Devi puja is a thanksgiving where, single-handed,

50:05.532 --> 50:09.532
just like a very loving mother, under Her sari,

50:09.532 --> 50:18.532
She protected you, fought for you, fought with every enemy that is around,

50:19.532 --> 50:24.532
every sort of problems that existed

50:24.532 --> 50:31.532
and ultimately brought you into Sahastrara level and then gave you Realisation.

50:31.532 --> 50:35.532
It’s a real thanksgiving to the Mother.

50:37.532 --> 50:43.532
So we can say Navaratri is like a Mother’s Day where you give thanksgiving to Her:

50:43.532 --> 50:50.532
which was just relentless, continuous working for Her children.

50:53.532 --> 50:59.532
Motherhood is much more important than the guruhood.

50:59.532 --> 51:05.532
Because guru is the one who trains you, makes you efficient.

51:05.532 --> 51:08.532
But the Mother forgives you,

51:08.532 --> 51:13.532
She loves you, She sustains you and She teaches you how to love.

51:13.532 --> 51:19.532
She has tremendous patience and tremendous love and She does it single-handed.

51:19.532 --> 51:23.532
She doesn’t expect anything from you – absolutely selfless.

51:24.532 --> 51:31.532
'Selfless’ is a very small word I should say, it’s such an expansive compassion

51:31.532 --> 51:41.532
which engulfs everything that is wrong, dissolves it, digest it, absorbs it.

51:43.532 --> 51:48.532
So it’s a very great day Navaratri is, for all the Sahaja Yogis,

51:48.532 --> 52:01.532
because then She took Her form as Sita, as the Power of Shri Rama, silent potential,

52:01.532 --> 52:07.532
suffering. How much She suffered! How much She suffered!

52:09.532 --> 52:12.532
Then She took the form of Radha.

52:13.532 --> 52:21.532
Then She came as five powers of Saraswati as the five wives of Shri Krishna.

52:23.532 --> 52:30.532
Then She came as Mary: that was the greatest suffering, I think, to see the Son being crucified.

52:30.532 --> 52:36.532
The suffering, silent, patient suffering, She had to go through it.

52:37.532 --> 52:40.532
All that drama, to be seen, was too much.

52:40.532 --> 52:46.532
She went through all that because you all had to cross your Agya Chakra.

52:46.532 --> 52:48.532
She had to sacrifice Her Child.

52:48.532 --> 52:52.532
It’s easy for a father to do that, very difficult for a mother.

52:53.532 --> 52:59.532
Now you are all mothers, so many of you, you will know what it is to have a child

52:59.532 --> 53:02.532
and how one feels about it.

53:05.532 --> 53:07.532
After doing that,

53:07.532 --> 53:13.532
She comes to the state where you have to give your Realisation.

53:13.532 --> 53:16.832
Is a work of tremendous patience, as you know.

53:16.832 --> 53:20.532
It’s tremendous patience and understanding.

53:20.532 --> 53:28.532
Human beings, as the time advanced, have evolved no doubt for Realisation,

53:28.532 --> 53:34.532
but also evolved to very funny, stupid, crooked nonsensical ways.

53:34.532 --> 53:40.532
It’s impossible to understand how they go about with their stupid ideas

53:40.532 --> 53:42.532
and how troublesome they can be!

53:42.532 --> 53:47.532
They can be very crooked, funny, troublesome

53:47.532 --> 53:53.532
to such an extent that sometimes even it is difficult to forgive.

53:55.532 --> 54:01.532
Despite that so many of you are here today, in Europe,

54:01.532 --> 54:07.532
in the land of the Guru, here I find, who have got Realisation.

54:07.532 --> 54:14.532
So the Mother’s pride, Mother’s joy knows no bounds,no doubt about it.

54:14.532 --> 54:17.532
It’s such a great thing to see Her children

54:17.532 --> 54:23.532
sitting here to receive all the powers from Her.

54:24.532 --> 54:28.532
Now, again, when we are in this situation,

54:28.532 --> 54:34.532
we have to know the first principle with which the whole thing started

54:34.532 --> 54:38.532
that it is the power of love.

54:41.532 --> 54:47.532
It is the power of love that has brought you to this state

54:47.532 --> 54:53.532
and it’s the power of love that you will express and manifest; you will evolve.

54:55.532 --> 55:02.532
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga also the temptations become subtler and subtler.

55:02.532 --> 55:10.532
We try to do Sahaj Yog, we try to spread Sahaja Yoga, sometimes for the powers .

55:10.532 --> 55:13.532
Maybe you are lonely so you want to have more Sahaja Yogis.

55:13.532 --> 55:19.532
Maybe you do it because you think that, that’s how you spread your powers.

55:19.532 --> 55:24.532
Even there are problems on leadership I find, ego problems there are.

55:24.532 --> 55:28.532
Somebody’s appointed a leader then another feels bad, this, that all goes on.

55:28.532 --> 55:33.532
I see the drama going on. Like small children they fight. What is this leadership?

55:33.532 --> 55:37.532
Is just artificial! It’s not even noted in any newspaper!

55:43.532 --> 55:48.532
As they have mock governments we have a mock leadership.

55:50.532 --> 55:54.532
So then people fight for that – this becomes subtler.

55:54.532 --> 55:57.532
The power struggle goes on becoming subtler.

56:00.532 --> 56:06.532
Then again money problems come up. Some people think that

56:06.532 --> 56:09.532
Sahaja Yoga is a very big way of making money.

56:09.532 --> 56:13.532
Or some people think that, “We can get lot of money, because

56:13.532 --> 56:18.532
Mother blesses people with money, affluence, so let us be in Sahaja Yoga,”

56:18.532 --> 56:20.532
but don’t spend a single pai, you see,

56:20.532 --> 56:27.532
just manage it. No! It’s not like that. It’s the other way round!

56:30.532 --> 56:33.532
It’s again the another dilemma is there that,

56:33.532 --> 56:43.532
in India which is a place of poverty compare to all of you, everyone donates money.

56:43.532 --> 56:49.532
All the trustees in every centre wherever there are trustees,

56:49.532 --> 56:54.532
have to donate at least five thousand rupees to become the trustees.

56:54.532 --> 56:58.532
Of course, I don’t get anything out of it,

56:58.532 --> 57:02.432
but I must have donated I don’t know how many how much myself

57:02.432 --> 57:05.532
to become the Trustee of Sahaja Yogis!

57:06.832 --> 57:09.832
But you have to donate.

57:12.832 --> 57:18.832
And when you become miserly again that means, again, it’s the same thing going on.

57:20.832 --> 57:25.832
You have bank balances but the source is finished and you have nothing left.

57:26.832 --> 57:30.832
The bank balance should be with God.

57:30.832 --> 57:35.832
Then He gives you interest more than the capital.

57:35.832 --> 57:38.832
Is there any bank which does that?

57:41.832 --> 57:45.832
At least not the Swiss Bank!

57:47.832 --> 57:50.832
You have to pay for keeping money with them.

57:54.832 --> 58:03.832
That’s how it is. You should tap . Always try to go to the source.

58:06.832 --> 58:11.832
This becomes subtler and subtler in the sense

58:11.832 --> 58:15.832
that people think that now their children are realised-souls.

58:16.832 --> 58:20.832
All right, so what? They are not Gods, are they?

58:20.832 --> 58:25.832
They get so involved with their children, I mean, this is another stupidity women fall into.

58:27.832 --> 58:30.832
But to them their child is so important,

58:30.832 --> 58:32.832
they get so adhered to the child.

58:32.832 --> 58:37.832
I mean, first they used to neglect the children, now they become so attached to their children

58:37.832 --> 58:41.832
that they look like glued people all the time.

58:43.832 --> 58:48.832
And such children cannot grow properly unless and until you give them freedom.

58:49.832 --> 58:52.832
Give them full freedom to grow.

58:52.832 --> 59:01.832
But guidance, of course, that they are majestic people, meaning Sahaja Yogis,

59:01.832 --> 59:06.832
they are born realised as a Sahaja Yogi, as a good Sahaja Yogi how they should behave.

59:06.832 --> 59:11.832
Have a rapport, talk to them, tell them about you now, how they should be.

59:11.832 --> 59:16.832
Develop that self-respect within them that they should be like this.

59:16.832 --> 59:18.832
Not to glue them to you.

59:22.832 --> 59:26.832
That’s not the way. Children will never grow properly, even physically,

59:26.832 --> 59:28.832
if you glue them to yourself.

59:30.832 --> 59:35.832
In the West now I see new ideas coming up that the children must be glued to the mother.

59:36.832 --> 59:41.832
This is from one extreme to another extreme.They’ll become very left-sided.

59:41.832 --> 59:46.832
Even if they’ll be grown up in age they won’t grow up in their brains.

59:46.832 --> 59:50.832
They won’t grow up in their behaviour if they are glued with the mother.

59:51.832 --> 59:55.832
If they cry for a while, little bit, doesn’t matter,

59:55.832 --> 59:59.832
but the children must be made to sleep away from the mother.

59:59.832 --> 01:00:04.832
All the time you should not carry your children in your lap. There is no need at all.

01:00:05.832 --> 01:00:11.832
But this is not that the child wants, is the mother who wants this kind of a thing.

01:00:13.832 --> 01:00:20.832
And some fathers also I have seen glue down to their children

01:00:21.832 --> 01:00:28.832
and then they say, “Mother, my child is spoiled, he’s like this, like that.”

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:33.832
Such children will get possessed very fast if you make the children dependant on you.

01:00:33.832 --> 01:00:36.832
Very fast they’ll become possessed.

01:00:36.832 --> 01:00:40.832
If you make them over-independent, “You are on your own,”

01:00:40.832 --> 01:00:43.832
Like the other side was that when we were in Oxted

01:00:43.832 --> 01:00:48.832
a girl of seven years used to come and give us newspapers.

01:00:48.832 --> 01:00:51.832
And she was a daughter of a lord!

01:00:51.832 --> 01:00:56.832
At about five o’clock in the morning, in that cold she used to climb up all the way

01:00:56.832 --> 01:01:00.832
on a bicycle delivering those newspapers.

01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:03.832
And when I told her mother, “What are you doing? It’s very dangerous,

01:01:03.832 --> 01:01:06.832
this child is in danger, she is a girl, how can you do that to her?”

01:01:06.832 --> 01:01:09.832
she said, “No, no, she has to be on her own.”

01:01:11.832 --> 01:01:17.832
So the one side is to be on her own and another side is to glue them,

01:01:17.832 --> 01:01:22.832
is again the same subtle attitude of possessiveness. It’s possessiveness,

01:01:22.832 --> 01:01:28.832
"This is my child, I must look after the child, the child is self-realised soul, this, that.”

01:01:28.832 --> 01:01:34.832
Only your child is not realised soul, everybody’s child is the realised-soul in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:34.832 --> 01:01:37.832
How much do you do for other’s children?

01:01:37.832 --> 01:01:40.832
Or only you look after your own child?

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:46.832
The custom should be: if you buy one thing for your child,

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:50.832
buy two more things for another child.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:55.832
Buy better things for another child and less things for your child.

01:02:00.832 --> 01:02:03.832
Let your child share his things with others.

01:02:04.832 --> 01:02:08.832
At the time when you are buying something, buy something that he can share.

01:02:08.832 --> 01:02:10.832
Teach him how to share.

01:02:10.832 --> 01:02:16.832
Because though they are realised souls, with the mothers and the fathers like this

01:02:16.832 --> 01:02:21.832
they’ll become again the same miserly old style people:

01:02:23.832 --> 01:02:29.832
quarrelsome, fighting, beating each other, troubling each other.

01:02:29.832 --> 01:02:31.832
So be careful .

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:42.832
Being realised-souls, you will be surprised, they will be extremely, extremely convenient for you.

01:02:42.832 --> 01:02:45.832
Give them to other Sahaja Yogis to handle, depend on them,

01:02:45.832 --> 01:02:47.832
let them look after.

01:02:47.832 --> 01:02:54.832
And the homogeneous feeling comes through children. Children are the ones who bind each other.

01:02:54.832 --> 01:02:58.832
But, “Don’t touch my child! This is my child!”

01:02:58.832 --> 01:03:01.832
You close the door as soon as somebody comes in.

01:03:02.832 --> 01:03:06.832
That’s you are going back in the same way as your mothers have been.

01:03:07.832 --> 01:03:10.832
There’s no war on in Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:11.832 --> 01:03:15.832
We are in the government of God.

01:03:16.832 --> 01:03:19.832
This realisation has to come.

01:03:19.832 --> 01:03:24.832
There is no need to seek all these useless things, these pleasures of life.

01:03:25.832 --> 01:03:30.832
Understand your responsibility

01:03:30.832 --> 01:03:36.832
that you are Sahaja Yogis first and last and in the middle

01:03:38.832 --> 01:03:42.832
and as Sahaja Yogis what is your duty?

01:03:42.832 --> 01:03:48.832
Is to be completely dedicated for the betterment and the benevolence of others.

01:03:50.832 --> 01:03:54.832
That’s the only thing which is going to nourish you to rise.

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:58.832
If you look after your children like this, like mad, it’s not going to help you .

01:03:58.832 --> 01:04:00.832
You’ll have problems.

01:04:00.832 --> 01:04:03.832
If you neglect your children, you will have problems.

01:04:06.832 --> 01:04:13.832
So come in the centre and be just witnesses of all that.

01:04:17.832 --> 01:04:23.832
It’s a very common failing in the beginning of every Sahaja Yogi who comes to Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:23.832 --> 01:04:29.832
They’ll send me the list of five generations on this side and five generations on this side

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:40.832
"my fathers, brothers, sisters, this thing, that thing, real cousins, real this thing is sick.

01:04:40.832 --> 01:04:43.832
So please, Mother, put Your attention.”

01:04:43.832 --> 01:04:47.832
And when I put my attention, the attention returns back, I can’t find that.

01:04:49.832 --> 01:04:55.832
It starts like that to begin with. Alright, in the beginning I say, “Alright, just now they have entered.”

01:04:55.832 --> 01:04:59.832
But you don’t know [that] these are tentacles which keep you down,

01:04:59.832 --> 01:05:05.832
they do not allow you to rise in the domain of God.

01:05:05.832 --> 01:05:11.832
In the domain of God everything that is yours, even your hair,

01:05:11.832 --> 01:05:14.832
are looked after by God Almighty.

01:05:14.832 --> 01:05:20.832
Every thing! Can you understand that? Can you realise that?

01:05:20.832 --> 01:05:31.832
Is all done by billions and billions and billions of powers of Adi Shakti.

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:42.832
What can you do yourself? Nothing! Except for worrying and troubling.

01:05:42.832 --> 01:05:51.832
So just if you believe and assume that power today

01:05:51.832 --> 01:05:55.832
that you are in the domain of God,

01:05:56.832 --> 01:06:00.832
which is active benevolence,

01:06:00.832 --> 01:06:05.832
the nature of it is active benevolence

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:08.832
as we say ‘hita’  (हित).

01:06:13.832 --> 01:06:17.832
If you are sick, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:17.832 --> 01:06:20.832
If you are alright, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:26.832
If you have money it is for your benevolence. If you don’t have money, it is for your benevolence.

01:06:30.832 --> 01:06:35.832
Everything does good for you in the domain of God.

01:06:35.832 --> 01:06:42.832
Do not judge it according to your own standards.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:49.832
Whom do you think to be a person who is benevolent in this world apart from Me?

01:06:51.832 --> 01:06:53.832
Really, in the real sense of the word?

01:06:54.832 --> 01:06:58.832
Supposing you take a man who is very rich;

01:06:58.832 --> 01:07:00.832
is he benevolent?

01:07:01.832 --> 01:07:07.832
No. Is he happy? No. Is he respected? No.

01:07:11.832 --> 01:07:17.832
At least he has to be a realised soul to be somewhere near that description.

01:07:19.832 --> 01:07:23.832
And if you have to ascend in the domain of God,

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:27.832
you have to know that everything works through His power:

01:07:27.832 --> 01:07:36.832
your activity, your inactivity, your sleep, everything is worked through His powers of love.

01:07:36.832 --> 01:07:41.832
Love can never harm, can never destroy.

01:07:41.832 --> 01:07:44.832
You go a little ahead with it

01:07:47.832 --> 01:07:53.832
and it showers flowers upon you.

01:07:55.832 --> 01:08:02.832
But understand your nature: supposing you are a left-sided person.

01:08:02.832 --> 01:08:06.832
Mostly I’ve seen left-sided persons always want to do my pujas.

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:11.832
And the right-sided person are organising.Do the other way round.

01:08:11.832 --> 01:08:19.832
must know your nature, give yourself a balance, and then enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:08:19.832 --> 01:08:24.832
Like you entering into a door, say for example,

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:27.832
and you have too much load on your back,

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:29.832
meaning you are a left-sided person.

01:08:29.832 --> 01:08:36.832
Then take down the load from your back on your head and enter in.

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:43.832
But if you have too much on your head, put it on your back and enter in.

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:46.832
Because you’re tired. You do it every day.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:50.832
Supposing this hand is tired, you put it on the left hand.

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:55.832
I see in aeroplane when people are walking they are holding it in one hand

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:59.832
and automatically when it is tired, they put it to the left – automatically.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:01.832
They are not Sahaja Yogis!

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:08.832
In the same way in life also, if you have done one-sidedness too much,

01:09:08.832 --> 01:09:13.832
try to do the other side and give yourself a balance.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:20.832
Navaratri is the day to give you the balance.

01:09:21.832 --> 01:09:28.832
Those whose right hand is tired will get the power in the left hand.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:37.832
Those who have the left hand tired will get the power on the right hand to share the load.

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:46.832
So those who are having money problems will solve their money problems.

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:53.832
And those who have sleeping problems will solve their sleeping problems.

01:09:53.832 --> 01:09:58.832
But one can say if somebody has both, then what do they do?

01:09:58.832 --> 01:10:04.832
I know of somebody, I lived there, in that country

01:10:04.832 --> 01:10:09.832
where they have both the problems, they sleep as well as they have no money and they are not bothered!

01:10:24.832 --> 01:10:27.832
So, for such people what should we do?

01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:32.832
Of course, I won’t tell you, but one has to do something about it!

01:10:39.832 --> 01:10:42.832
One has to work out something.

01:10:45.832 --> 01:10:47.832
They just don’t move

01:10:47.832 --> 01:10:53.832
and if you tell them, answer is, “I know. I know I sleep a lot,

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:57.832
I know I’m like this. I know. I know.”

01:10:57.832 --> 01:11:00.832
That’s all. Then what do you say?

01:11:00.832 --> 01:11:06.832
It stops you completely. You can’t go further. If they know, what more to be told?

01:11:10.832 --> 01:11:20.832
This is a complete mountain there standing just to finish you completely.

01:11:29.832 --> 01:11:32.832
So one has to do.

01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:36.832
Everyone has to do something.

01:11:36.832 --> 01:11:38.832
Somebody is working it out,

01:11:38.832 --> 01:11:42.632
somebody is doing some work,

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.632
and another is not helping.

01:11:44.632 --> 01:11:51.632
Then that cannot be completed, it’s a collective work, you cannot! One person cannot do it.

01:11:52.632 --> 01:11:57.632
I’ve seen it happens like this. It’s a collective work.

01:11:57.632 --> 01:12:03.632
So we come to the position that Navaratri today is not the work of Mother only,

01:12:03.632 --> 01:12:07.632
which She did so far, is the work of every one of you.

01:12:08.632 --> 01:12:10.632
I cannot do it single-handed.

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:15.632
If I could, there was no need for you to be here,

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:20.632
I would have built the aeroplane, put you there, pushed them some or other, lock it up and put you there.

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:22.632
It’s not possible.

01:12:23.632 --> 01:12:26.632
You all have to carry your own aeroplanes.

01:12:26.632 --> 01:12:30.632
Build it up and carry it yourself with dignity,

01:12:30.632 --> 01:12:33.632
not like small children. So you have to mature.

01:12:34.632 --> 01:12:39.632
And for that maturity it’s a collective thing that has to take place.

01:12:39.632 --> 01:12:43.632
In the beginning in the school they’ll teach you two plus two is equal to four.

01:12:43.632 --> 01:12:47.632
But when you go to the college, you have to do it yourself,

01:12:48.632 --> 01:12:51.632
solve the problem yourself.

01:12:51.632 --> 01:12:59.632
And that’s what it is today. Sahaja Yoga is good, you get your Realisation in these modern times,

01:12:59.632 --> 01:13:03.632
but the maturity has to take place,

01:13:03.632 --> 01:13:05.632
otherwise useless.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:13.632
Up to the seed it was alright, but once it is sprouted it must become the tree, otherwise it’s useless.

01:13:14.632 --> 01:13:17.632
And that all of you have to do together,

01:13:17.632 --> 01:13:20.632
helping each other, understanding each other.

01:13:20.632 --> 01:13:24.632
And everyone has to work it out.

01:13:24.632 --> 01:13:27.632
Even if one person suffers, I suffer.

01:13:32.632 --> 01:13:36.632
The whole thing has become collective.

01:13:38.632 --> 01:13:41.632
The Devi has become collective.

01:13:43.632 --> 01:13:46.632
It’s a venture.

01:13:48.632 --> 01:13:53.632
It’s a venture, I know, too much of it. There was no other way out.

01:13:53.632 --> 01:14:01.632
It’s like crucifixion of every part of Your body, every cell of Your body.

01:14:04.632 --> 01:14:06.632
But it’s alright.

01:14:09.632 --> 01:14:13.632
So today, instead of feeling guilty,

01:14:13.632 --> 01:14:19.632
you should be filled with tremendous courage and tremendous enthusiasm

01:14:19.632 --> 01:14:24.632
that we have to do it, because Mother has gave us the power.

01:14:24.632 --> 01:14:27.632
We can do it, nothing should keep us down.

01:14:28.632 --> 01:14:30.632
And we are going to help each other.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:36.632
One person is doing one job, nobody will look at it, you see, they won’t just move!

01:14:36.632 --> 01:14:41.632
"I know, I’m sitting down, I know. I don’t do anything I know.”

01:14:45.632 --> 01:14:48.632
And in Sahaja Yoga, it has become even subtler,

01:14:48.632 --> 01:14:52.632
"I want to do but there’s a bhoot in me which doesn’t allow me to do it.”

01:14:54.632 --> 01:14:56.632
So you get out with your bhoot!

01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.632
That’s what it is.

01:15:01.632 --> 01:15:11.632
All these arguments are stupid, of no value in Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:15.632
That means you have not understood the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

01:15:15.632 --> 01:15:21.632
you have not understood the meaning of yourself and you have no respect for your life.

01:15:21.632 --> 01:15:22.632
That’s what it is.

01:15:22.632 --> 01:15:26.632
If you indulge into such thinking, then it is no good.

01:15:26.632 --> 01:15:31.632
But today you have to promise to yourself and to me within your heart

01:15:32.632 --> 01:15:37.632
that you are going to be filled with that enthusiasm and that shakti.

01:15:39.632 --> 01:15:42.632
The time has come.

01:15:48.632 --> 01:15:53.632
Which is going to make you real yogis.

01:15:56.632 --> 01:15:58.632
Complete dedication.

01:15:58.632 --> 01:16:04.632
Imagine these PLO people what they are doing, fearlessly.

01:16:04.632 --> 01:16:06.632
I mean, all kinds of people you see around you

01:16:06.632 --> 01:16:09.632
even in Kali Yuga are so dedicated to something nonsensical.

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:13.632
Why can’t we be dedicated to something so sensible?

01:16:17.632 --> 01:16:20.632
They are not afraid of anything,

01:16:20.632 --> 01:16:23.632
they are dare devils.

01:16:23.632 --> 01:16:25.632
Why can’t we become like that?

01:16:26.632 --> 01:16:29.632
What’s wrong with us?

01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:37.632
So every one of us must have that enthusiasm and “I’m an institution by myself.

01:16:37.632 --> 01:16:42.632
And I’m going to do it, I’m not going to take advantage of the ashram life,

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:46.632
nicely settled down in the ashram. You see very good, cheap.”

01:16:46.632 --> 01:16:50.632
No! We are all going to move out also

01:16:50.632 --> 01:16:53.632
and take up a place somewhere else.

01:16:53.632 --> 01:16:55.632
For the time being ashram is alright.

01:16:55.632 --> 01:16:58.632
But then give more room to others who are coming.

01:16:58.632 --> 01:17:02.632
You get out of it. Go out and stay somewhere and work it out.

01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:08.632
Then in the ashram, “This is my house, I have spent money for this,

01:17:08.632 --> 01:17:12.632
this is my furniture, this is this thing, that thing.”

01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:23.632
Actually you should know how to live on a string, shoestring, as they say, on a shoestring.

01:17:23.632 --> 01:17:29.632
Of course now I’m feeling that every ashram has such a lot of furniture that they had to bring.

01:17:30.632 --> 01:17:33.632
Better live on a shoestring.

01:17:33.632 --> 01:17:39.632
So the tapasya starts.

01:17:39.632 --> 01:17:42.632
Go into a penance yourself.

01:17:42.632 --> 01:17:47.632
But then I will hear, “Mother, I’m on a tapasya, I’m eating only once.”

01:17:47.632 --> 01:17:52.632
Why? Who ask you to be on tapasya? Enjoy! Enjoy your tapasya!

01:17:52.632 --> 01:17:55.632
Then it is Sahaja, otherwise it’s nonsense.

01:17:55.632 --> 01:17:59.632
Enjoy. If you can enjoy your tapasya then you are sahaj;

01:17:59.632 --> 01:18:03.632
with enthusiasm. Look at these PLOs,

01:18:04.632 --> 01:18:07.632
look at these people,

01:18:09.632 --> 01:18:15.632
do they say, "We are going in a tapasya”? Nothing.

01:18:16.632 --> 01:18:19.632
You have examples of people around you.

01:18:20.632 --> 01:18:23.632
But we can’t say  they are possessed by bhoots.

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:29.632
Or even if they are what about you? You better get possessed by sahaj bhoots for a change!

01:18:31.632 --> 01:18:35.632
If that’s the way, only, you can be motivated.

01:18:41.632 --> 01:18:47.632
So tell your mind, “No explanations, nothing doing. I am going to show my worth!”

01:18:55.632 --> 01:19:00.632
But all the time if the attention is just to show off

01:19:00.632 --> 01:19:04.632
or to be in my attention

01:19:05.632 --> 01:19:12.632
or to be in contact with me, to be writing to me or something, is not going to help at all.

01:19:17.632 --> 01:19:23.632
I am just a mirror and you see within myself, yourself, in the true way.

01:19:23.632 --> 01:19:29.632
And also this mirror is full of maya.

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:39.632
So a devil may look into this mirror and may look like a saint to him.

01:19:39.632 --> 01:19:43.632
If he has ego he might look like a saint to himself.

01:19:45.632 --> 01:19:56.632
Or if he is a left-sided person he might think he is the incarnation of Bhairava – he might.

01:20:00.632 --> 01:20:10.632
But if he is truthful, he can see clearly that he is the highest of highest, he's a sahaja yogi

01:20:10.632 --> 01:20:16.632
And unless and until you see yourself like that, know that it’s a maya.

01:20:21.632 --> 01:20:28.632
So to realise that you have achieved a lot by getting your Realisation,

01:20:28.632 --> 01:20:32.632
of rising so much higher above all these petty ideas.

01:20:32.632 --> 01:20:37.632
Every idea is petty, whether it is economics, politics, philosophy,

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:41.632
any ism, anything is all petty for a Sahaja Yogi,

01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:50.632
because none of them know even this much about God’s domain.

01:20:50.632 --> 01:20:53.632
What are they talking about is economics!

01:20:57.632 --> 01:21:00.632
They do not know anything about His politics.

01:21:02.632 --> 01:21:07.632
They do not know anything that there is a miraculous power

01:21:07.632 --> 01:21:10.632
which rules the whole Universe

01:21:11.632 --> 01:21:16.632
and which is so efficient. Which never fails.

01:21:17.632 --> 01:21:23.632
So timely, so sensible, so interesting, dramatic.

01:21:23.632 --> 01:21:28.632
See how we reserved all these things in no time.

01:21:28.632 --> 01:21:33.632
How we got to this place. I was to have this puja here.

01:21:33.632 --> 01:21:36.632
All this you know. How I came here.

01:21:36.632 --> 01:21:41.632
See the miracle working. How the powers of the Divine are working.

01:21:41.632 --> 01:21:43.632
You be the proper instrument of the Divine.

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:46.632
And it has another force as I told you

01:21:46.632 --> 01:21:50.632
centripetal and centrifugal – and you might be thrown out.

01:21:52.632 --> 01:21:58.632
So be careful on that point. Face yourself in truthfulness!

01:21:58.632 --> 01:22:02.632
Do not get pampered by your ego or morosed  by your superego!

01:22:02.632 --> 01:22:07.632
Just see for yourself as a powerful instrument of love.

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:10.632
But in love you do not become indiscrete.

01:22:12.632 --> 01:22:20.632
Steadily, beautifully, gently you attend to it.

01:22:22.632 --> 01:22:28.632
And so much power can be born.

01:22:28.632 --> 01:22:33.632
You will be amazed that water, which looks something so frivolous to us,

01:22:33.632 --> 01:22:36.632
has so much power in it.

01:22:37.632 --> 01:22:39.632
You know about hydrostatics.

01:22:42.632 --> 01:22:46.632
This Mother Earth which looks so simple:

01:22:46.632 --> 01:22:51.632
We walk on Her on our feet. She attracts us on ourself.

01:22:51.632 --> 01:22:54.632
She’s spinning with such a speed Herself,

01:22:54.632 --> 01:22:56.632
She keeps us sticking on to Her.

01:22:57.632 --> 01:23:02.632
She’s doing thousands and thousands of tremendous jobs,

01:23:02.632 --> 01:23:06.632
this great Mother Earth She looks so simple.

01:23:06.632 --> 01:23:14.632
She’s so powerful. In the same way you are made out of this Ganesha Tattwa which is so tremendous.

01:23:18.632 --> 01:23:22.632
This Navaratri should give you that power,

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:28.632
those nine powers of nine chakras.

01:23:28.632 --> 01:23:33.632
Seven chakras you already know.

01:23:33.632 --> 01:23:38.632
Above that you become the master yourself,

01:23:39.632 --> 01:23:44.632
and then you become the Power yourself.

01:23:52.632 --> 01:23:54.632
May God bless you!
