00:00.260 --> 00:01.260
Kundalini.

00:01.260 --> 00:02.710
You see,sickness comes to you,

00:02.710 --> 00:07.070
as I told you, through our centers getting
exhausted.

00:07.070 --> 00:11.870
As this is one center, all right, on the left
side, left sympathetic,

00:11.870 --> 00:15.240
and right sympathetic, and they join together,
this is the center.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.330
So we are using the energy of this center
that is limited, for our purpose, anything.

00:20.330 --> 00:25.580
Supposing, I’ll give an example, of a very
good example of our Swadisthan chakra.

00:25.580 --> 00:30.619
It’s the second center which looks after
the aortic plexus in the medical terminology,

00:30.619 --> 00:34.699
but it’s not complete, I mean it’s one
of the parts.

00:34.699 --> 00:37.309
Now the work of the Swadisthan chakra,

00:37.309 --> 00:42.199
according to Sahaja Yoga, which has worked
of course, wonders with this theory,

00:42.199 --> 00:48.539
that it gives energy for the replacement of
the brain cells.

00:48.539 --> 00:51.170
Because we never think about it, we are using
the brain all the time,

00:51.170 --> 00:54.600
we don’t think how it is replaced, even
within the medical art they don't think about

00:54.600 --> 00:56.129
it.

00:56.129 --> 01:01.280
So one of the work it has got, it moves here
and also it has to look after your liver,

01:01.280 --> 01:03.539
it has to look after your pancreas,

01:03.539 --> 01:04.970
it has to look after spleen,

01:04.970 --> 01:06.790
it has to look after your kidneys,

01:06.790 --> 01:12.600
it has to also look after the lower part of
your large intestines.

01:12.600 --> 01:13.600
Alright?

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
Now.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.690
But all the time a person is thinking,

01:16.690 --> 01:21.040
these days every body thinks too much and
very futuristic.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.740
As a result, it cannot pay attention to all
other things.

01:25.740 --> 01:29.920
So what happens, the first thing which is
affected it the liver.

01:29.920 --> 01:35.890
Now, liver gets all the heat from the all
body and eliminates it -

01:35.890 --> 01:41.320
it’s poison for the body you can say - eliminates
it into the blood circulation,

01:41.320 --> 01:43.840
it goes into the blood.

01:43.840 --> 01:50.670
Now when, you see, liver is not attended to
or doesn’t get sufficient energy,

01:50.670 --> 01:56.280
starts working very hard, so it becomes an
over active liver and this heat cannot be

01:56.280 --> 01:58.140
removed,

01:58.140 --> 02:01.780
so the heat starts rising upward and downwards.

02:01.780 --> 02:02.780
As a result, your - these,

02:02.780 --> 02:08.420
what you call - the lungs are made as you
know,

02:08.420 --> 02:17.930
they are made like a sponge, so it becomes
coagulated and you develop asthma.

02:17.930 --> 02:22.260
We cure asthma through liver.

02:22.260 --> 02:23.260
Incurable.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.140
Then it descends down, when it descends down,

02:27.140 --> 02:29.079
it affects your kidneys.

02:29.079 --> 02:31.060
By that you get high blood pressure.

02:31.060 --> 02:37.469
Also, another thing you get is constipation.

02:37.469 --> 02:40.180
Then your pancreas is neglected.

02:40.180 --> 02:45.609
When pancreas is neglected you get diabetes.

02:45.609 --> 02:52.359
Only the people who are thinking sitting,
planning for future get diabetes, never a villager.

02:52.359 --> 02:54.459
In India, if you go to a village,

02:54.459 --> 02:58.889
they’ll say : “you have to put sugar as
much as the spoon must stand at a right angle.”

02:58.889 --> 03:01.940
They take so much sugar, nobody gets diabetes,

03:01.940 --> 03:05.980
because they earn in the morning, nicely go
home and sleep off.

03:05.980 --> 03:09.900
When we think and think, and think of the
future.

03:09.900 --> 03:15.140
So the neglect of the pancreas gives you diabetes.

03:15.140 --> 03:19.519
Now we have many people who have cured diabetes
also.

03:19.519 --> 03:24.030
Then the third one is the worse, is the spleen,

03:24.030 --> 03:28.840
that the spleen is like, you say rhythm, gives
the rhythm,

03:28.840 --> 03:31.459
it’s a in speedometer in us.

03:31.459 --> 03:35.650
And supposing you are eating the food and
suddenly you have to run,

03:35.650 --> 03:40.040
then you get a pain because it has to produce
red blood corpuscles.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.579
But if you are always in an emergency in modern
times,

03:42.579 --> 03:45.010
as you are, first of all you read the newspaper,

03:45.010 --> 03:50.029
you are under shock, because newspaper must
shock you, you see.

03:50.079 --> 03:52.919
So, then another shock, then another shock.

03:52.919 --> 03:55.629
Then in the traffic, you get a shock.

03:55.629 --> 03:57.969
So this poor spleen doesn’t know how to
behave

03:57.969 --> 04:02.090
in this crazy world and it becomes very crazy
and vulnerable.

04:02.090 --> 04:05.149
And with the slightest shock, it can get blood
cancer.

04:05.159 --> 04:09.650
I must tell you that we have cured really
blood cancer patients.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.489
Absolutely cured, completely cured,

04:11.489 --> 04:14.499
without any medicine or anything, absolutely
cured.

04:14.499 --> 04:17.670
We have certificates and everything about
them.

04:17.670 --> 04:23.130
And surprisingly, all of them were architects.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.220
This is one.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.121
Then, another thing that I told you,

04:26.121 --> 04:30.660
it affects the kidneys and it affects also
the lower intestines.

04:30.660 --> 04:36.400
So, only one center, if you use it too much
for one purpose,

04:36.400 --> 04:39.150
can give you all these troubles.

04:39.150 --> 04:43.200
And ultimately the heat might rise to the
heart and you may have a massive heart attack.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.700
Specially, if young people, if they are drinking
too much,

04:47.700 --> 04:53.850
if they are playing tennis or which is very
– I mean any game which is like football

04:53.850 --> 04:55.040
or tennis,

04:55.040 --> 04:57.260
drinking too much and thinking too much,

04:57.260 --> 05:03.310
they might get a massive heart attack and
die very young, at a very young age.

05:03.310 --> 05:05.040
I mean it’s absolutely fatal.

05:05.040 --> 05:11.220
If you get this attack at a young age, it’s
fatal, you cannot save them.

05:11.220 --> 05:15.840
The other way round, if you are - if you have
inactive organs also,

05:15.840 --> 05:19.870
you can have inactive also due to that,
also you get troubles.

05:19.870 --> 05:25.900
So when you treat somebody on his roots, it’s
very easy to solve the problem.

05:25.900 --> 05:31.130
See, supposing you have to treat a tree and
you start treating all the leaves, it’s

05:31.130 --> 05:32.130
very difficult.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.970
But if you can go to the roots, it’s so
easy, it’s simple.
