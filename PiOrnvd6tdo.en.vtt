00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:03.479
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.673
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:22.018
for different, different purposes.

00:07:26.269 --> 00:07:35.139
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.680
who were worshipping the Mother,

00:07:38.713 --> 00:07:49.103
they found out that what
She has done for us.

00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:53.705
The other day I told you
the dharma

00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:01.275
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:08.154
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:13.178
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:20.514
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:29.555
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.304
though we are not aware of it.

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:39.197
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

00:08:39.222 --> 00:08:44.380
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:51.828
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

00:08:54.227 --> 00:09:00.717
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

00:09:00.758 --> 00:09:10.281
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:20.567
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:28.381
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

00:09:28.406 --> 00:09:35.219
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

00:09:35.244 --> 00:09:40.090
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:44.867
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

00:09:44.892 --> 00:09:52.162
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

00:09:52.187 --> 00:09:56.511
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

00:09:56.536 --> 00:10:02.467
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

00:10:02.492 --> 00:10:12.535
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.684
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:23.961
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

00:10:23.986 --> 00:10:30.628
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:34.638
So, the second one She says is:

00:10:34.663 --> 00:10:41.650
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:46.064
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:53.934
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:57.164
But, it’s not there.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:11:04.220
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:10.991
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:13.642
and some present to another one.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:19.354
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:25.239
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

00:11:25.264 --> 00:11:34.081
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:37.841
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:43.175
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.158
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

00:11:47.183 --> 00:11:52.735
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.396
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

00:11:57.421 --> 00:12:02.445
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:11.744
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:16.326
These so close to each other.

00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:24.077
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

00:12:24.102 --> 00:12:28.547
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

00:12:28.572 --> 00:12:32.416
if You can go to that country”.

00:12:32.441 --> 00:12:35.736
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:41.666
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:51.828
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

00:12:51.853 --> 00:13:00.823
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:06.983
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:12.503
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:20.083
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

00:13:20.108 --> 00:13:24.612
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:29.789
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

00:13:29.814 --> 00:13:35.132
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

00:13:35.157 --> 00:13:40.883
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:44.050
Then you must compete with others.

00:13:44.075 --> 00:13:50.521
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:58.725
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:07.179
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

00:14:07.204 --> 00:14:13.005
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.512
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

00:14:16.537 --> 00:14:23.071
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:26.927
Forgiveness from the heart.

00:14:26.952 --> 00:14:32.291
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

00:14:32.316 --> 00:14:35.273
has exploited you, has troubled you,

00:14:35.298 --> 00:14:41.150
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

00:14:41.175 --> 00:14:46.803
Do we use that power to forgive?

00:14:50.671 --> 00:14:58.235
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.451
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

00:15:03.476 --> 00:15:08.451
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

00:15:08.476 --> 00:15:14.893
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

00:15:14.918 --> 00:15:19.103
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:15:19.128 --> 00:15:23.978
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

00:15:24.003 --> 00:15:29.924
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:33.971
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

00:15:33.996 --> 00:15:37.997
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

00:15:38.022 --> 00:15:42.475
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:50.488
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:55.765
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.869
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

00:15:59.894 --> 00:16:06.823
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

00:16:06.848 --> 00:16:13.502
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

00:16:13.526 --> 00:16:21.215
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.605
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.086
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:31.387
But when your ego is working or...

00:16:31.412 --> 00:16:35.951
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

00:16:35.976 --> 00:16:41.240
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

00:16:45.398 --> 00:16:50.484
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:58.262
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

00:16:58.287 --> 00:17:02.037
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:05.750
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:11.592
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

00:17:11.617 --> 00:17:16.093
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:20.393
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

00:17:20.418 --> 00:17:26.262
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

00:17:26.287 --> 00:17:32.156
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:36.279
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

00:17:36.304 --> 00:17:39.851
So, Mother has to tell you.

00:17:45.038 --> 00:17:53.960
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

00:17:53.985 --> 00:18:00.348
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

00:18:00.373 --> 00:18:04.168
She puts you into delusion,

00:18:04.193 --> 00:18:08.910
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

00:18:08.935 --> 00:18:15.291
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

00:18:15.316 --> 00:18:20.919
She allows, allows you to go wrong

00:18:20.944 --> 00:18:25.640
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

00:18:25.665 --> 00:18:28.901
Very important it is that She plays,

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:32.653
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:36.844
And this is discussed
in every religion

00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:41.713
that we get lost with this delusion.

00:18:41.738 --> 00:18:46.317
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

00:18:46.342 --> 00:18:50.247
We have the delusions
of ego.

00:18:50.272 --> 00:18:55.525
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:02.100
that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:06.515
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.381
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

00:19:11.406 --> 00:19:19.899
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

00:19:19.924 --> 00:19:25.046
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

00:19:25.071 --> 00:19:30.132
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

00:19:30.157 --> 00:19:35.396
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:39.788
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

00:19:40.278 --> 00:19:46.863
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

00:19:46.888 --> 00:19:49.951
then only you can return back.

00:19:49.976 --> 00:19:54.285
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:20:05.569
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

00:20:05.594 --> 00:20:10.334
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:16.920
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

00:20:16.945 --> 00:20:22.955
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.278
It is beyond the mind.

00:20:26.303 --> 00:20:33.311
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

00:20:33.687 --> 00:20:40.963
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

00:20:40.988 --> 00:20:47.917
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:52.390
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

00:20:52.415 --> 00:20:56.448
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

00:20:56.473 --> 00:20:59.917
and this connection should not
be broken,

00:20:59.942 --> 00:21:05.030
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:08.706
All this is within us,

00:21:09.344 --> 00:21:15.052
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

00:21:15.077 --> 00:21:21.938
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

00:21:21.963 --> 00:21:27.031
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

00:21:27.056 --> 00:21:34.764
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:40.684
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

00:21:40.709 --> 00:21:47.372
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:47.397 --> 00:21:51.834
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:59.592
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

00:21:59.617 --> 00:22:05.117
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

00:22:05.142 --> 00:22:07.251
For example, it is also said that,

00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:14.188
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:22:15.005 --> 00:22:20.624
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

00:22:20.649 --> 00:22:29.700
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

00:22:30.964 --> 00:22:37.664
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

00:22:37.689 --> 00:22:42.267
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

00:22:42.292 --> 00:22:47.459
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.676
Lajja rupena samsthita:

00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:57.868
means you have to have shame
of your body.

00:22:58.757 --> 00:23:02.535
That’s specially for women.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:11.191
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

00:23:11.216 --> 00:23:14.272
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

00:23:14.297 --> 00:23:17.235
That shyness gradually disappears,

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.735
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.195
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.346
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

00:23:30.955 --> 00:23:34.325
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.564
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

00:23:39.589 --> 00:23:44.445
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.541
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

00:23:49.566 --> 00:23:54.575
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.481
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

00:23:59.506 --> 00:24:03.581
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

00:24:03.606 --> 00:24:06.915
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.599
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

00:24:10.624 --> 00:24:17.484
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:24.661
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

00:24:24.686 --> 00:24:33.391
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:40.811
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

00:24:40.836 --> 00:24:45.628
There is no space for any artist

00:24:45.653 --> 00:24:55.280
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

00:24:55.305 --> 00:25:02.345
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.554
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

00:25:06.579 --> 00:25:14.222
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

00:25:14.657 --> 00:25:19.870
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

00:25:19.895 --> 00:25:23.521
then it is His art,

00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:31.211
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

00:25:31.236 --> 00:25:36.188
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

00:25:36.213 --> 00:25:40.447
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:44.056
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:47.750
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

00:25:47.775 --> 00:25:54.001
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

00:25:54.517 --> 00:26:00.299
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

00:26:00.324 --> 00:26:04.397
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

00:26:04.422 --> 00:26:09.614
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:13.306
and we start behaving in their
manner,

00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:16.357
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

00:26:16.382 --> 00:26:21.740
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

00:26:21.765 --> 00:26:26.335
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.487
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

00:26:30.512 --> 00:26:33.276
they would never have accepted
them.

00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:36.358
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

00:26:36.383 --> 00:26:39.728
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

00:26:39.753 --> 00:26:45.321
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

00:26:45.346 --> 00:26:52.132
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

00:26:52.157 --> 00:26:57.023
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

00:26:57.048 --> 00:27:01.471
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

00:27:01.496 --> 00:27:08.043
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

00:27:08.068 --> 00:27:11.697
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

00:27:11.722 --> 00:27:16.839
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

00:27:16.864 --> 00:27:22.091
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

00:27:22.116 --> 00:27:26.005
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.090
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:33.566
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:41.632
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

00:27:41.657 --> 00:27:45.544
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

00:27:45.569 --> 00:27:49.642
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:56.197
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

00:27:56.223 --> 00:28:01.626
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:09.346
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

00:28:09.371 --> 00:28:12.549
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

00:28:12.574 --> 00:28:16.153
or to worship the idols or anything,

00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:24.608
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:30.318
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

00:28:30.343 --> 00:28:37.554
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

00:28:37.579 --> 00:28:41.721
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

00:28:41.746 --> 00:28:44.756
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:51.542
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:28:51.567 --> 00:28:57.535
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.936
and this and that, and give
justification.

00:29:01.961 --> 00:29:06.519
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.744
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:13.197
and who are misbehaving.

00:29:13.222 --> 00:29:19.031
You must do what a saint should do.

00:29:19.485 --> 00:29:23.682
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

00:29:23.707 --> 00:29:28.568
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

00:29:28.593 --> 00:29:34.999
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

00:29:35.024 --> 00:29:39.116
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

00:29:39.141 --> 00:29:42.759
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

00:29:42.784 --> 00:29:48.079
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

00:29:48.104 --> 00:29:52.540
You can change the things
that you are eating,

00:29:52.565 --> 00:29:58.165
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:05.775
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.896
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

00:30:10.921 --> 00:30:15.789
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

00:30:15.814 --> 00:30:20.154
But all the time worried about
their body.

00:30:20.179 --> 00:30:26.830
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

00:30:26.855 --> 00:30:35.260
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

00:30:36.122 --> 00:30:40.197
Fashion is madness.

00:30:41.412 --> 00:30:47.739
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

00:30:47.764 --> 00:30:50.467
But in India also fashion started.

00:30:50.492 --> 00:30:54.935
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

00:30:54.961 --> 00:31:01.566
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

00:31:01.591 --> 00:31:05.844
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

00:31:05.869 --> 00:31:08.074
You have a particular design,

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:12.081
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

00:31:12.106 --> 00:31:15.778
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

00:31:15.803 --> 00:31:20.747
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

00:31:20.772 --> 00:31:27.096
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:34.068
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

00:31:34.109 --> 00:31:39.093
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

00:31:39.118 --> 00:31:43.607
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

00:31:43.632 --> 00:31:48.699
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

00:31:48.724 --> 00:31:53.850
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

00:31:53.875 --> 00:31:59.144
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

00:31:59.169 --> 00:32:05.793
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

00:32:05.818 --> 00:32:09.465
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.323
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:18.154
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:24.784
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

00:32:24.808 --> 00:32:28.165
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:33.783
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

00:32:33.808 --> 00:32:37.664
- you have to exercise and meditate.

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:42.237
If you meditate you become peaceful.

00:32:42.262 --> 00:32:47.741
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

00:32:47.774 --> 00:32:56.149
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

00:32:56.174 --> 00:32:59.562
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

00:32:59.587 --> 00:33:04.171
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

00:33:04.196 --> 00:33:10.024
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

00:33:10.049 --> 00:33:17.054
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

00:33:17.079 --> 00:33:22.356
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

00:33:22.381 --> 00:33:29.993
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

00:33:30.018 --> 00:33:34.747
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

00:33:34.772 --> 00:33:39.533
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

00:33:39.558 --> 00:33:43.101
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

00:33:43.126 --> 00:33:45.853
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

00:33:45.878 --> 00:33:50.280
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

00:33:50.305 --> 00:33:54.176
The joy of that artist is finished.

00:33:54.201 --> 00:34:00.197
You cannot get that joy,

00:34:01.554 --> 00:34:09.280
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

00:34:09.305 --> 00:34:14.516
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:20.394
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:23.666
and it makes the life so miserable.

00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:28.389
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:34.202
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

00:34:34.227 --> 00:34:39.450
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

00:34:39.475 --> 00:34:43.326
problems of sometimes snowing.

00:34:43.358 --> 00:34:46.602
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

00:34:46.627 --> 00:34:50.028
and it’s very well done, we got it.

00:34:50.053 --> 00:34:55.968
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

00:34:55.993 --> 00:35:02.629
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

00:35:02.654 --> 00:35:07.912
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

00:35:07.937 --> 00:35:12.498
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

00:35:12.523 --> 00:35:18.772
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

00:35:18.797 --> 00:35:22.473
of these Italians, so-called.

00:35:22.498 --> 00:35:26.944
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:31.583
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:36.376
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:40.888
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

00:35:40.913 --> 00:35:47.980
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:51.796
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

00:35:51.821 --> 00:35:57.206
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

00:35:57.231 --> 00:36:00.838
With a simple thing like that.

00:36:00.863 --> 00:36:07.797
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

00:36:07.822 --> 00:36:11.008
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:13.914
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

00:36:13.939 --> 00:36:17.239
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

00:36:17.264 --> 00:36:22.315
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:27.216
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:31.754
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

00:36:31.779 --> 00:36:37.066
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:42.917
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

00:36:42.942 --> 00:36:50.638
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

00:36:50.663 --> 00:36:58.551
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

00:36:58.576 --> 00:37:03.905
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:10.214
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:17.086
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

00:37:23.337 --> 00:37:33.322
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

00:37:33.347 --> 00:37:41.052
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

00:37:41.077 --> 00:37:45.017
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

00:37:45.042 --> 00:37:48.621
What is the need to think?”.

00:37:49.372 --> 00:37:55.979
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

00:37:56.004 --> 00:38:00.227
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

00:38:00.252 --> 00:38:04.176
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:09.535
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:15.575
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:25.054
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:27.907
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

00:38:27.932 --> 00:38:34.554
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:38.239
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

00:38:38.264 --> 00:38:42.745
What is the need to go to Mars?

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:47.212
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

00:38:47.237 --> 00:38:49.931
First they came to India, then went
to China,

00:38:49.956 --> 00:38:56.176
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

00:38:56.201 --> 00:39:00.323
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

00:39:00.348 --> 00:39:04.907
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

00:39:04.932 --> 00:39:09.955
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

00:39:09.988 --> 00:39:13.822
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

00:39:13.847 --> 00:39:17.231
then they’ll jump in.

00:39:17.256 --> 00:39:22.492
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

00:39:22.517 --> 00:39:26.561
Because monkeys won’t do that.

00:39:26.586 --> 00:39:33.576
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:38.792
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

00:39:38.817 --> 00:39:44.072
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

00:39:44.097 --> 00:39:49.054
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:51.358
They have no time!

00:39:51.383 --> 00:39:55.623
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

00:39:55.648 --> 00:40:00.798
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

00:40:00.823 --> 00:40:04.957
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

00:40:04.982 --> 00:40:08.448
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

00:40:08.473 --> 00:40:11.895
For meditation they have no time.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:19.878
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

00:40:20.298 --> 00:40:27.409
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

00:40:28.882 --> 00:40:34.618
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

00:40:35.629 --> 00:40:41.434
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

00:40:41.459 --> 00:40:48.590
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

00:40:49.265 --> 00:40:53.694
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

00:40:53.719 --> 00:40:58.133
But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

00:40:58.158 --> 00:41:02.427
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

00:41:02.452 --> 00:41:04.696
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

00:41:04.721 --> 00:41:10.679
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

00:41:10.704 --> 00:41:14.847
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:17.996
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

00:41:18.021 --> 00:41:21.010
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

00:41:21.035 --> 00:41:25.000
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:33.056
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:39.072
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:43.687
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

00:41:43.712 --> 00:41:49.633
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

00:41:49.658 --> 00:41:55.347
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

00:41:55.372 --> 00:42:03.164
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

00:42:03.189 --> 00:42:12.507
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:20.189
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

00:42:20.214 --> 00:42:22.698
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

00:42:22.723 --> 00:42:29.517
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:33.633
So they also wanted to see.

00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:42.242
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

00:42:44.116 --> 00:42:50.169
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

00:42:50.194 --> 00:42:53.790
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

00:42:53.815 --> 00:42:59.499
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

00:42:59.524 --> 00:43:02.022
Did you follow this point?

00:43:02.047 --> 00:43:09.902
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

00:43:09.927 --> 00:43:15.342
where you are yourself that.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:20.338
So, how can you see yourself?

00:43:20.363 --> 00:43:24.592
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

00:43:24.617 --> 00:43:28.517
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

00:43:28.542 --> 00:43:34.729
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

00:43:34.754 --> 00:43:39.945
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:44.139
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

00:43:44.164 --> 00:43:52.174
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

00:43:52.454 --> 00:43:57.810
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:04.893
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

00:44:05.259 --> 00:44:11.689
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

00:44:11.714 --> 00:44:19.885
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

00:44:21.235 --> 00:44:29.043
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

00:44:29.068 --> 00:44:36.372
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

00:44:36.397 --> 00:44:42.227
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

00:44:42.252 --> 00:44:49.282
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

00:44:49.307 --> 00:44:55.662
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

00:44:55.687 --> 00:45:00.485
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:06.547
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

00:45:06.572 --> 00:45:10.662
Whatever I may try on My own

00:45:10.687 --> 00:45:15.301
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

00:45:15.326 --> 00:45:22.827
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

00:45:22.852 --> 00:45:35.232
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

00:45:35.257 --> 00:45:39.330
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

00:45:39.355 --> 00:45:44.244
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

00:45:44.269 --> 00:45:50.702
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

00:45:50.727 --> 00:45:58.768
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:03.083
You use them.

00:46:04.498 --> 00:46:07.086
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

00:46:07.111 --> 00:46:13.137
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

00:46:13.162 --> 00:46:20.075
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.260
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

00:46:24.285 --> 00:46:33.779
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

00:46:34.084 --> 00:46:40.649
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

00:46:41.213 --> 00:46:45.351
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

00:46:45.376 --> 00:46:52.736
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

00:46:52.761 --> 00:46:58.702
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

00:46:58.727 --> 00:47:06.205
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:12.171
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:21.044
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

00:47:21.293 --> 00:47:29.349
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

00:47:29.374 --> 00:47:32.016
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

00:47:32.041 --> 00:47:35.622
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

00:47:35.647 --> 00:47:40.991
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

00:47:41.016 --> 00:47:46.736
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

00:47:46.761 --> 00:47:52.010
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:54.765
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:59.154
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:03.746
He started looking at me
like this.’”

00:48:04.394 --> 00:48:06.539
So, with the Kundalini awakening

00:48:06.564 --> 00:48:12.253
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

00:48:12.278 --> 00:48:17.745
And then your generosity,

00:48:19.392 --> 00:48:25.914
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

00:48:25.939 --> 00:48:32.788
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:42.555
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.687
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

00:48:47.712 --> 00:48:50.134
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

00:48:50.159 --> 00:48:57.878
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

00:48:57.903 --> 00:49:02.482
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

00:49:02.507 --> 00:49:12.318
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

00:49:12.343 --> 00:49:16.559
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

00:49:16.584 --> 00:49:26.481
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:32.727
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

00:49:32.752 --> 00:49:38.438
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

00:49:38.463 --> 00:49:43.311
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

00:49:43.336 --> 00:49:49.278
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

00:49:49.303 --> 00:49:55.859
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

00:49:55.884 --> 00:49:58.426
They are just within you,

00:49:58.451 --> 00:50:04.996
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

00:50:05.021 --> 00:50:10.111
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

00:50:10.136 --> 00:50:17.275
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:21.886
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:25.753
May God bless you all.
