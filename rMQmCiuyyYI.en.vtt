00:02.520 --> 00:07.880
I was telling about how difficult it is
to be a Mother and a Guru.

00:08.200 --> 00:13.560
Because both are very
contradictory functions.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.840
And specially for a person who wants
to be in charge of your salvation,

00:19.040 --> 00:22.040
to be the Moksha Dayini
[Bestower of Liberation],

00:22.280 --> 00:25.320
it is extremely difficult.

00:25.520 --> 00:30.400
Because the path is so…
so delicate and so treacherous

00:30.600 --> 00:36.000
that all of you have to
come yourself, walk across.

00:36.200 --> 00:42.200
And if you fall this side or that side,
there is disaster for you.

00:42.960 --> 00:48.440
I am watching your climbing,
and I see you coming up

00:48.680 --> 00:53.400
with a Mother’s heart
and a Guru’s hand.

00:54.040 --> 00:58.760
And then I get the glimpses
of people falling.

00:58.960 --> 01:01.440
I try to tell them, “Come up.”

01:01.640 --> 01:05.320
Sometimes I shout.
Sometimes I pull them up.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.320
Sometimes I love them
and caress them.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.320
You can yourself judge,
within yourself,

01:13.520 --> 01:17.600
how much I have worked on you,
how much I have loved you.

01:17.800 --> 01:21.920
But how much do you love
yourself is the point.

01:22.200 --> 01:25.520
I have told you
that, for a Sahaja Yogi,

01:25.800 --> 01:29.440
the whole thing should be decided
by the witnessing power.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.720
Now, the witnessing power is silent,
it doesn’t talk.

01:32.920 --> 01:38.920
If you are a very talkative person,
then it’s not going to help you much.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.240
You have to come in balance.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.280
For the first time in this incarnation
I have started talking,

01:45.480 --> 01:49.400
and I get so troubled because
I am not used to this kind of talking.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.120
So for you people, it is necessary
that you should not talk

01:54.320 --> 01:57.000
unless and until
you feel like talking.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.320
And very few sentences,
conclusive.

02:01.520 --> 02:07.520
As I told you before, the tongue is the master
of all the organs of distractions.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.400
If you could master your tongue,

02:13.120 --> 02:16.600
you have mastered
all of them, in a way.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.560
Because everything
has to be palatable.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.120
For example, you look at a woman.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.800
If she is not palatable,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.560
then she may be beautiful
but you don’t want to look at her.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.520
She decides, the tongue decides
about a person.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.360
If you want to eat some food,

02:34.560 --> 02:37.920
if it is not palatable,
then you don’t want to eat that food.

02:38.120 --> 02:41.120
It has to be palatable.

02:41.800 --> 02:47.080
Then a thought also.
A thought has to be palatable.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.720
If it is not palatable,
you are not going to have it.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.480
So the deciding factor
is the tongue.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.280
The root of the tongue
goes up to the Vishuddhi chakra,

02:55.480 --> 02:57.400
which controls your ego
and superego.

02:57.600 --> 03:03.320
Or you can say that the tongue
is reflected in superego and ego in a way.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
Through your tongue,
when you speak,

03:09.080 --> 03:13.680
one can make out whether you are
in the realm of ego or superego.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.520
She expresses, she decides.

03:20.600 --> 03:25.360
But if you understand her,

03:25.560 --> 03:28.560
then you know how to handle her.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.720
She is your friend.

03:33.440 --> 03:38.440
And Saraswati Herself
resides in your tongue.

03:38.640 --> 03:44.640
If you know how to handle
your tongue,

03:46.280 --> 03:52.600
then Sahaja Yoga
can rise very high up.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.680
Because when others
meet you as Sahaja Yogis,

04:00.360 --> 04:03.800
they also see how…
the way you talk,

04:04.160 --> 04:09.360
the way you eat, the way
that things are palatable to you.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.400
It is the tongue that decides.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.560
If you are really very much evolved,
you will be amazed

04:21.760 --> 04:24.480
that, if you eat some food somewhere,
immediately the tongue will

04:24.680 --> 04:26.400
immediately throw it out.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.480
It won’t have it
if it is something wrong.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.960
If some prasad, so-called, is given to you,
which is given by some wrong type of man,

04:34.160 --> 04:36.160
immediately your tongue
will throw it away.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.440
It won’t be able to take it in.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.800
And even if you take, somehow or other,
it’s forced down in the stomach,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.680
still the tongue will inform the brain
that “Throw it out!”

04:46.880 --> 04:49.560
and the brain will inform the stomach
that “Throw it out!”

04:49.760 --> 04:52.080
It will be unpalatable.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.840
The reaction of Vishnu in the stomach
up to the action of Shri Krishna —

04:57.040 --> 05:00.800
I mean, the same personality —
is all judged by your tongue.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
So you must know how pure, holy
your tongue should be.

05:06.640 --> 05:12.640
But when you take the name
of your Mother with this tongue,

05:14.120 --> 05:18.080
you must know it has to be
the holiest of holy.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.440
It is very important
how you use your tongue.

05:23.720 --> 05:29.720
Those who talk very bluntly
are just the same

05:33.640 --> 05:39.320
[as] those who talk very sweetly
to get something out of you.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.520
Is the intention [that matters].

05:43.680 --> 05:47.280
As I have told you,
it controls ego and superego.

05:47.480 --> 05:52.280
Even the Sahaja Yogis understand
that the witness is also here,

05:52.480 --> 05:55.480
at the Vishuddhi chakra.

05:55.960 --> 06:01.960
So your witnessing power will increase
and decrease according to your tongue.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.840
Of course, it controls
sixteen sub-plexuses.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.800
It also controls the muscles of the eyes,
it controls all these muscles.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
It controls the palate, it controls
the teeth, it controls the ears.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.440
But ears, you hear something —
you cannot control it.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.280
Tongue, you can —

06:27.480 --> 06:31.640
because that is the thing
which releases, which goes out.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.480
With the ear, you cannot give
anything to others.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.440
That is just one way.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.880
This [tongue] is double way thing:
you take in something

06:42.080 --> 06:45.080
and also can throw out something.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.520
It has a double purpose.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.640
It is a very important organ, and that’s
why we have to look after our tongues.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.880
When the Kundalini is rising,

06:57.080 --> 07:01.000
that means one thing is there —
that your attention has become subtle.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.160
From gross to subtle.

07:03.360 --> 07:08.960
But it has to become subtler and subtlest,
and then it has to go beyond that.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.160
By becoming subtle only,
it comes up through the Agnya.

07:14.360 --> 07:20.000
Because Agnya is just like
a hole in a needle.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.920
So it penetrates through that,
through the subtle there.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.960
Because of that subtleness,

07:26.160 --> 07:31.480
your attention sees everything,
but in a subtle form.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.600
Now, this is a new
experience for you,

07:34.800 --> 07:38.960
that’s why you do not recognise
what is that.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.360
In a group of Sahaja Yogis,

07:45.560 --> 07:48.400
you can witness these things
very carefully and clearly.

07:48.600 --> 07:54.160
There is one person
whose eyes are roving still, around.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.160
He’s a Sahaja Yogi; he’ sitting down,
he’s looking here, looking there,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.800
looking that side,
who is coming, who is going.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.920
Of course, this person is still
in the gross state, you can say,

08:04.120 --> 08:06.160
though he’s got
his attention up here

08:06.360 --> 08:09.640
by Mataji’s pulling it out, you see,
and hanging onto it!

08:09.840 --> 08:15.400
(Laughing) But still the person himself
is still dragging outside into the gross.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.360
So don’t bother about that type.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.720
But even the person
who is now, say, attentive —

08:19.920 --> 08:24.280
we can say attentive because, you see,
words are not so precise —

08:24.480 --> 08:26.880
even if you notice
such a person, you’ll find

08:27.080 --> 08:30.080
it’s two forces in a very
subtle way are acting:

08:30.280 --> 08:34.880
one is his subtle ego,
another is a subtle superego.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.840
When you become subtle, suddenly
you get, also, powers of the subtle.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.760
Let us see the ego side of it.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.200
You start feeling inside yourself —

08:47.400 --> 08:50.520
in a very subtle way, that you do not
recognise that it is ego,

08:50.720 --> 08:56.720
it is too subtle to be recognised —
that you have got powers now to cure.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.840
You start feeling that now you have
powers to raise the Kundalini.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.320
See how it goes down
sedimenting into you.

09:04.520 --> 09:09.400
Then you start feeling you have
powers to express yourself

09:10.080 --> 09:12.240
because you think
you have learnt Sahaja Yoga

09:12.440 --> 09:16.600
and now you know the essence of it
and you can talk about it.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.840
This subtle ego develops into you.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.400
And the fourth type
of subtle ego develops

09:24.600 --> 09:28.960
when you see the other person’s
superego is developing.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.600
That is the most dangerous.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.040
It so happens that some people…

09:36.240 --> 09:39.480
whose superego develops now
because they have had previous gurus,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.600
previous problems, previous… you see,

09:41.800 --> 09:45.800
the way they have been following religion,
some mistakes and all that.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.720
Because of their mistakes,
their superego develops.

09:49.920 --> 09:53.080
You’ll see something
happening to them.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.120
so an X, Mr X sees Y,

09:56.320 --> 09:59.960
that a superego is coming onto him,
some negativity is flowing into him.

10:00.160 --> 10:04.800
So his ego starts developing
against that a force. In a subtle way.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.920
Now, he calls it a positive force —
it is a positive force, no doubt —

10:08.120 --> 10:11.120
but he over-crosses it.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.880
When he over-crosses that side,

10:14.080 --> 10:19.840
he tries to push the superego
[of] another person, he trips over.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.360
He thinks he is doing the right thing.
Of course, he is doing in a way —

10:23.560 --> 10:26.560
but to a point.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.400
And then he becomes
very hot-tempered.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.960
He goes on passing remarks
about others.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.160
He says harsh things.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.520
That’s how
the subtlest point starts.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.600
To a point is all right.

10:41.800 --> 10:48.480
To a point because in this,
I would say, Ganesh and Jesus

10:49.040 --> 10:53.800
should be treated
as the judging points.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.040
Christ did not mind
when He was crucified.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.240
Not only that but He asked
for forgiveness for all those.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.520
But if His Mother was
even touched by somebody,

11:03.720 --> 11:07.480
He would have taken out His eleven Rudras
[destructive forces] and killed them.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.360
That’s the point.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.840
When it comes to your Mother,

11:12.040 --> 11:16.160
then of course, your ego and superego
both have a meaning.

11:16.360 --> 11:21.600
But beyond that, if it starts directed
at every Sahaja Yogi,

11:21.800 --> 11:26.200
then you don’t know where to go,
where to have the balance.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.640
For example, then such people,
anything done to them,

11:28.840 --> 11:30.720
also they identify themselves
with Mother, and they think,

11:30.920 --> 11:33.320
“No, no, he has said it to me,
that means it is to Mother also.”

11:33.520 --> 11:36.520
It is not so.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.800
You must know where you are criticised
and where your Mother is criticised.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.840
These are two things.
That’s why I said judging point is Christ.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.800
When He was crucified, He accepted it,
though He was so much one with His Mother.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.720
But still He could strike that line.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.000
When you are crucified,
you are not Christ.

11:56.200 --> 12:01.440
But if anybody says anything
against the Mother, then of course.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.120
Now try to understand yourself.
Now you are watching yourself.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.160
Whatever I am saying, you are watching
yourself. It is for your good.

12:10.480 --> 12:15.960
That is how you find somewhere a person
who gets a superego invasion.

12:16.160 --> 12:20.560
First of all, superego invasion is very,
very deep and subtle. It’s extremely deep.

12:20.760 --> 12:25.400
It comes into you in such a manner
that you do not understand it.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.880
The other person
who is very positive, so-called,

12:28.080 --> 12:30.600
will think that that person
has got a negativity.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.960
But he won’t know that he is over-crossing
his positivity towards negativity itself.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.320
Because, once you cross this line,
you go to this side.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.840
Once you cross this line,
you go to this side.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.640
So, immediately you are becoming
negative once you cross this point.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.880
And it’s the Sahastrara,
is the Brahmarandhra.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.520
Beyond the Brahmarandhra,
if you are pushing down,

12:48.720 --> 12:50.480
then you are crossing
to the other side.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.000
You are playing into hands
of other people.

12:57.680 --> 13:02.440
Now, you must judge yourself and see:
“Now, hello Mr X, how are you behaving now?”

13:02.640 --> 13:06.080
Immediately you become a witness,
you see, witness of yourself.

13:06.280 --> 13:09.320
Now, how the superego and ego,
you see, sometimes…

13:09.520 --> 13:11.960
in some people, sometimes
the ego presses the superego

13:12.160 --> 13:14.560
and the superego presses the ego.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.840
I have seen it.

13:16.040 --> 13:22.040
They don’t know whether they are egoistical
or whether they are dominated.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.120
They really do not know,
they cannot decide.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.840
Because it’s such a going on,
wobbling all the time.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.800
That’s why I say: baithak [state of quiet sitting].
You must sit down, settle down.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.840
See for yourself: “Am I settled?”

13:34.040 --> 13:35.680
Watch in yourself.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.480
Even you can feel the force,

13:37.680 --> 13:39.960
actually you can feel the force
moving from this side to this side.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.840
You’ll feel the force
moving from this side to this side;

13:42.040 --> 13:44.560
try to bring it in the centre.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.000
Now, ego and superego,

13:47.200 --> 13:53.200
when they go on like that,
you can say wobble [from] one to another,

13:53.840 --> 13:55.800
it happens like this:

13:56.000 --> 13:59.360
at one moment you start
feeling dejected, frustrated,

13:59.560 --> 14:02.960
fed up with yourself:
“Nonsense! Get out!”,

14:03.160 --> 14:06.760
the other moment you sit on yourself,
sit on other people.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.600
You ask others to “Get out!
This is bad! I didn’t like that man!

14:09.800 --> 14:13.560
That fellow came, that fellow caught me,
that thing happened, this thing happened…”

14:13.760 --> 14:18.800
Two extremes you move to.
That’s not the way to Sahaja Yoga.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.240
Sahaja Yoga — saha-ja means
that you are a witness.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.240
Saha-ja. It has double meaning.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.000
Sahaja is normally used for a word
which is “simple” — sahaj.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.680
You are in a sahaj method,
means you are a witness, you watch it.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.720
Look at these trees.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.800
They are just witnessing,
they are not saying anything.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.640
They are just there.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.440
It is to be.
It is just to be at this point.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.880
Are we that?
Every movement, dealing with anything?

14:50.080 --> 14:52.040
Then you will not have
any organisational problems.

14:52.240 --> 14:56.840
You have organisational problems
because you are not a witness.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.440
You’ll find two types of people:

14:58.640 --> 15:02.560
one who will say, “I’m suffering too much,”
the others who will say, “No, not me!”

15:02.760 --> 15:05.400
Then they interchange also.
See, their attitudes interchange,

15:05.600 --> 15:07.480
they can mix up.

15:07.680 --> 15:13.680
But you can just know
where to stop it.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.360
You become a witness, silent.

15:18.720 --> 15:23.360
After talking for one minute,
you just become silent.

15:23.560 --> 15:28.280
That’s the best way,
I think, I can say, a practical way —

15:28.640 --> 15:31.600
is for your tongue, is to be silent.

15:31.800 --> 15:35.000
As far as possible to be silent
and be watching.

15:35.200 --> 15:40.600
But some people are silent and brooding,
that’s the worst thing that you are doing.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.880
No! Silent and watching.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.600
Neither brooding
not planning how to hurt others.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.200
And then suddenly a sentence
will come out which would be so filthy,

15:51.400 --> 15:53.600
so cutting,

15:53.800 --> 15:58.840
so horrid, so full of venom

15:59.040 --> 16:02.840
that you think,
“From where it has come? Oh God!”

16:03.040 --> 16:06.520
Such silence is absolutely useless.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.840
It should be like a river flowing.

16:10.160 --> 16:15.800
The river has its own depth, and on top
it is flowing. It’s such one mass.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.440
That kind of a silence
one should have.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.720
Not a forced one
but a silence of a witness.

16:21.920 --> 16:25.800
Even such a person is talking, inside,
the flow of the silence is there.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.880
You are one with that silence,
it is filling you up all the time.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.440
And you can witness that in every leaf;
in every movement of the leaf,

16:32.640 --> 16:35.200
you see the silence flowing.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.800
They do not speak even,
but they manifest.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.080
In the same way, you do not speak,
you manifest.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.720
Of course, human beings are higher
than them because they speak,

16:45.920 --> 16:51.960
but if speech becomes a burden,
a problem, a cutting instrument,

16:52.160 --> 16:55.160
it is better not to speak.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.200
Another thing a Sahaja Yogi must know:

16:59.400 --> 17:02.600
that eyes are very important
for Sahaja Yoga.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.440
When the Kundalini rises,

17:04.640 --> 17:07.280
then the dilatation of the pupils
takes place because…

17:07.480 --> 17:09.600
you have seen the children
how their eyes are dilated,

17:09.800 --> 17:13.560
just gaping at everything
what is happening.

17:13.760 --> 17:17.840
Just gaping.
Silence, the complete.

17:18.040 --> 17:22.800
Silent seeing goes on through the eyes.
And that’s why eyes are very important.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.880
You must learn to fix your eyes
within yourself, in your heart.

17:26.080 --> 17:29.720
Humble down in your heart.
Fix your eyes in your heart.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.160
I say that way, but I don’t know
if you can do it.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.200
I don’t know if you can do it, but if you could do,
that’s a very good way of doing things.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.080
Looking at everyone, gazing at everyone,
seeing this, seeing that

17:41.280 --> 17:44.960
is a very bad exercise for your eyes,
it’s a very bad habit.

17:45.160 --> 17:49.120
Try to keep your eyes low,
on the earth, Mother Earth,

17:49.320 --> 17:54.280
watching the lower part of the body
than the face.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.160
Because face…

17:57.360 --> 18:02.560
if you are made that way that you
can watch the face, is all right,

18:02.760 --> 18:04.200
but you are not yet made.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.360
Best thing is to see to the feet.

18:06.560 --> 18:11.520
And your eyes will touch
their gross sense — feet,

18:11.720 --> 18:20.200
from where the sensation
of vibrations go up, upward,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.280
and the Kundalini rises better.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.960
Actually, those who suffer
from low Kundalini rising,

18:26.160 --> 18:30.800
if they could rub oil on their feet
and wash their feet,

18:31.000 --> 18:32.400
it’s a very good thing.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.760
That’s why Christ washed
the feet of His disciples.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.640
I wish I could do that
if you allow Me in subtlety.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.280
Because the whole grossness
is in the feet;

18:41.480 --> 18:47.480
and if you touch somebody with your eyes —
realised people I’m saying —

18:48.280 --> 18:51.600
their feet, most of their grossness
will disappear.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.640
And you won’t have
that much problem with them.

18:53.840 --> 18:57.720
That’s why Christ washed
the feet of His disciples.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.760
You also wash your feet
and keep them clean

19:00.960 --> 19:05.160
so that the grossness drops out.

19:09.320 --> 19:15.320
I have explained in brief way,
but if you want to ask Me questions, ask,

19:15.640 --> 19:21.640
because still I find that the Sahaja Yogis
are not rising as fast as they could.

19:22.280 --> 19:27.360
Because the… bringing Kundalini up to this
and up to this is possible for Me,

19:27.560 --> 19:33.320
but taking it back into your gross being
is your own job which you have to do it.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.880
In Marathi as they say,
“Da adi karatza maga paiya” —

19:37.080 --> 19:43.080
I have built the top, the dome for you,
and the dome is now to be supported by you.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.800
I have taken you to the dome,
but you cannot break it down

19:47.000 --> 19:49.600
because either you are
frustrated with yourself —

19:49.800 --> 19:52.440
but being frustrated,
what are you going to gain? —

19:52.640 --> 19:56.040
or else, you are frustrated
with others.

19:57.240 --> 20:01.240
Just be silent and be witnesses.

20:01.440 --> 20:06.320
As Sai Baba [from Shirdi] has said,
saburi, patience.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.520
It comes in.
