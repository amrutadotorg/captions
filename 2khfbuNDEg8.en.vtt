00:24.200 --> 00:30.699
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

00:32.741 --> 00:37.741
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:42.658 --> 00:45.241
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

00:48.658 --> 00:53.824
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

00:55.908 --> 01:04.075
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

01:10.991 --> 01:12.908
He is the source.

01:17.075 --> 01:19.783
He’s the source of spirituality.

01:23.158 --> 01:27.949
As a result of that all other things follow.

01:29.699 --> 01:33.824
Like when it rains and is windy

01:33.824 --> 01:37.783
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

01:40.741 --> 01:47.824
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

01:49.075 --> 01:53.783
we feel all these three things within and without.

01:55.949 --> 02:04.991
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

02:04.991 --> 02:15.699
that the most important fundamental Deity

02:15.699 --> 02:19.699
has been completely not only neglected,

02:19.699 --> 02:23.783
but insulted and crucified.

02:26.949 --> 02:30.241
So today though I did not want to say anything

02:31.908 --> 02:36.699
to upset you people, but I must tell you

02:36.741 --> 02:44.116
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

02:44.158 --> 02:46.908
a thorough cleansing within you.

02:49.241 --> 02:51.658
When you worship Shri Ganesha

02:52.824 --> 02:58.783
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

02:59.991 --> 03:01.908
keep your being clean -

03:01.908 --> 03:06.991
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

03:09.075 --> 03:11.075
Actually when the Kundalini rises

03:11.116 --> 03:14.991
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

03:15.033 --> 03:17.658
the innocence has to come up –

03:17.699 --> 03:27.991
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

03:30.241 --> 03:35.783
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

03:35.824 --> 03:41.200
that we have to mature.

03:46.866 --> 03:48.783
People are sick now.

03:48.824 --> 03:53.866
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

03:53.991 --> 03:59.158
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

04:01.033 --> 04:06.741
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

04:06.783 --> 04:14.824
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

04:17.158 --> 04:19.991
there was nothing more important than that.

04:26.033 --> 04:31.908
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

04:33.033 --> 04:36.200
and the power of conditionings we have had.

04:36.949 --> 04:39.116
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

04:39.158 --> 04:42.200
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

04:42.241 --> 04:43.241
terrible.

04:50.949 --> 04:54.200
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

04:56.949 --> 04:59.116
is not at all important.

05:02.699 --> 05:05.241
It is only when you want to have children

05:05.658 --> 05:08.116
actually a human being

05:08.158 --> 05:11.824
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

05:14.741 --> 05:17.824
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

05:17.824 --> 05:22.783
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

05:27.866 --> 05:36.783
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

05:38.116 --> 05:44.116
it comes from a very low grading within us.

05:45.908 --> 05:49.783
It comes from the low-graded human beings

05:54.866 --> 05:58.741
that one becomes servile to it.

05:59.741 --> 06:01.991
You should be the master of that.

06:05.824 --> 06:09.824
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

06:09.866 --> 06:12.991
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

06:15.200 --> 06:23.783
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

06:26.200 --> 06:30.699
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

06:33.033 --> 06:37.783
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

06:38.741 --> 06:40.949
and a pure personality.

06:44.866 --> 06:48.116
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

06:48.158 --> 06:49.949
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

06:50.075 --> 06:51.783
I mean, you just don’t understand,

06:51.783 --> 06:56.824
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

06:56.824 --> 07:02.033
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

07:02.741 --> 07:04.824
We have to mature ourselves.

07:08.158 --> 07:12.741
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

07:14.158 --> 07:19.200
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

07:19.241 --> 07:22.699
But of course you must mature;

07:22.699 --> 07:24.866
you need a tapasya for that.

07:27.991 --> 07:31.033
Unimportant thing when become important

07:31.033 --> 07:36.991
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

07:37.033 --> 07:38.824
that we have, like we have hair.

07:38.824 --> 07:42.949
Even if you lose hair it means something.

07:43.783 --> 07:47.200
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

07:47.241 --> 07:50.741
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

07:50.866 --> 07:53.824
Such a waste of energy.

07:58.908 --> 08:04.158
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

08:04.158 --> 08:07.241
so much of auspiciousness is spent

08:07.658 --> 08:10.158
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

08:14.033 --> 08:17.908
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

08:17.908 --> 08:18.949
we have to mature.

08:21.908 --> 08:24.158
Maturity has to come within us.

08:28.158 --> 08:31.866
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

08:31.908 --> 08:38.075
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

08:38.991 --> 08:44.824
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

08:50.908 --> 08:54.908
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

08:54.908 --> 08:59.908
or a pressure on people.

09:03.200 --> 09:09.949
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

09:09.949 --> 09:13.033
for you people, very costly.

09:13.033 --> 09:16.075
You have paid through so much;

09:17.741 --> 09:21.658
you have gone through so much. For what?

09:29.741 --> 09:33.241
So the priorities have to change

09:33.241 --> 09:36.116
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.991
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

09:43.741 --> 09:49.741
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

09:52.991 --> 09:57.033
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

09:57.033 --> 09:59.866
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

10:02.658 --> 10:08.991
is the basic of this whole Creation;

10:10.783 --> 10:14.949
is the essence of this Creation.

10:18.866 --> 10:23.699
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

10:25.158 --> 10:29.699
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

10:29.699 --> 10:32.200
who are primitive, then comes the stage

10:32.200 --> 10:35.949
where human beings are developed.

10:35.991 --> 10:40.699
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.866
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

10:44.824 --> 10:47.658
What is development is not outside.

10:47.699 --> 10:51.116
What is the within development one has to see.

10:51.158 --> 10:54.116
What have we grown inside?

10:56.783 --> 10:59.908
What have we got inside ourselves?

11:01.991 --> 11:08.824
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

11:10.741 --> 11:13.866
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

11:13.908 --> 11:16.241
say, for example, I give you a mango.

11:16.241 --> 11:17.949
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

11:19.241 --> 11:23.116
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

11:23.116 --> 11:28.158
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

11:32.200 --> 11:38.158
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.866
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

11:46.908 --> 11:49.783
What is our substance within ourselves?

11:53.991 --> 11:58.991
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

12:00.033 --> 12:03.116
So important for Him it was.

12:03.158 --> 12:07.241
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

12:07.241 --> 12:10.783
where of course morality is very important,

12:11.158 --> 12:18.116
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

12:18.116 --> 12:23.200
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

12:23.241 --> 12:27.033
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

12:27.033 --> 12:29.991
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

12:29.991 --> 12:33.658
But it should be your own innate light,

12:33.658 --> 12:36.783
that’s why Christ talked about it.

12:38.741 --> 12:47.908
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

12:52.783 --> 12:57.658
And I would not say that people were not warned.

12:57.699 --> 13:00.241
Freud was not the only person who was born.

13:01.866 --> 13:06.991
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

13:07.033 --> 13:11.200
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.241
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

13:15.658 --> 13:18.241
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

13:18.658 --> 13:21.158
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.075
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

13:25.116 --> 13:28.783
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

13:28.824 --> 13:31.824
then the attack of the death, all these things.

13:32.241 --> 13:35.116
I mean he was quite a recent person.

13:35.158 --> 13:42.949
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

13:42.949 --> 13:47.741
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

13:50.866 --> 13:58.699
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

13:58.741 --> 14:01.658
since long we know about hell.

14:01.991 --> 14:06.033
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

14:06.075 --> 14:08.866
This is hell.

14:14.741 --> 14:23.033
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

14:25.908 --> 14:30.658
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

14:30.699 --> 14:33.866
Is it mental power that’s important?

14:33.908 --> 14:36.866
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

14:36.908 --> 14:40.158
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

14:40.200 --> 14:48.200
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

14:48.200 --> 14:54.949
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.991
What is your emotional power?

15:01.033 --> 15:05.241
Emotions that you have takes you where?

15:07.866 --> 15:12.033
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

15:12.116 --> 15:15.741
Say, you love your wife very much.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.783
Where does it take you?

15:19.824 --> 15:24.741
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

15:24.741 --> 15:27.116
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

15:28.116 --> 15:34.658
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

15:34.699 --> 15:41.949
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

15:41.991 --> 15:42.949
She said, “How did you climb?”

15:42.949 --> 15:45.033
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

15:45.075 --> 15:47.783
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.741
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

15:53.741 --> 15:56.116
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

16:02.033 --> 16:05.824
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

16:05.866 --> 16:09.033
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

16:12.033 --> 16:16.075
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

16:16.075 --> 16:18.783
which destroys others.

16:18.783 --> 16:21.033
And the emotional power gives you

16:21.075 --> 16:26.200
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

16:26.241 --> 16:29.991
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

16:30.033 --> 16:33.033
on such and such person and what did I get?”

16:39.241 --> 16:42.824
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

16:44.158 --> 16:47.658
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

16:47.699 --> 16:50.783
Emotionally you are zero

16:50.824 --> 16:58.783
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

17:03.200 --> 17:08.699
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

17:11.658 --> 17:16.866
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

17:16.866 --> 17:23.075
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

17:23.116 --> 17:26.158
Then what is your power?

17:26.158 --> 17:31.991
Is your chastity.

17:33.200 --> 17:39.658
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

17:39.699 --> 17:52.241
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

17:58.200 --> 18:04.658
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

18:08.658 --> 18:10.824
From the face of a person you can say

18:10.866 --> 18:13.033
that this person is a chaste man.

18:13.033 --> 18:23.824
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

18:23.824 --> 18:26.116
the one who has never had sex in life,

18:26.116 --> 18:28.824
always shining on his face.

18:28.866 --> 18:34.158
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

18:34.200 --> 18:36.699
who has so many wives.

18:43.158 --> 18:48.824
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

18:48.824 --> 18:51.241
So the whole energy is inside.

18:51.658 --> 18:55.158
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

18:55.200 --> 19:00.033
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

19:00.033 --> 19:07.741
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

19:07.741 --> 19:11.741
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

19:11.783 --> 19:18.116
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

19:18.116 --> 19:23.241
Because we kept to our own vehicle

19:23.241 --> 19:28.033
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

19:32.783 --> 19:35.699
We are so particular that others must respect us,

19:35.741 --> 19:39.741
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

19:43.158 --> 19:50.158
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

19:55.991 --> 19:59.116
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

19:59.158 --> 20:05.116
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.116
Many people think that way.

20:10.116 --> 20:14.241
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

20:14.658 --> 20:18.783
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

20:18.824 --> 20:21.866
aesthetics, of course.

20:23.158 --> 20:27.741
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

20:29.824 --> 20:32.783
But culture you better learn from Indians.

20:37.866 --> 20:41.783
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

20:43.158 --> 20:47.949
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

20:47.949 --> 20:53.241
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

21:03.991 --> 21:08.200
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

21:08.241 --> 21:13.699
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

21:16.783 --> 21:23.699
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

21:23.699 --> 21:29.033
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

21:29.783 --> 21:34.908
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

21:34.949 --> 21:37.075
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

21:38.741 --> 21:43.116
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

21:43.116 --> 21:46.075
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

21:46.116 --> 21:52.658
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

21:52.699 --> 21:57.741
you can not understand that there can be someone

21:57.741 --> 22:00.116
who is absolutely chaste.

22:00.991 --> 22:03.741
For a thief everybody is a thief.

22:08.116 --> 22:12.824
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

22:12.824 --> 22:16.866
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

22:16.866 --> 22:18.991
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

22:22.949 --> 22:26.158
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.741
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

22:28.783 --> 22:36.158
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

22:36.200 --> 22:40.699
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

22:40.699 --> 22:44.949
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

22:44.949 --> 22:47.908
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

23:00.741 --> 23:03.866
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

23:03.908 --> 23:05.908
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

23:05.949 --> 23:08.033
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

23:08.949 --> 23:11.033
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

23:20.991 --> 23:24.200
You have to turn yourself out.

23:24.241 --> 23:30.824
And this is one of the reasons why

23:30.824 --> 23:33.824
people are very hot-tempered.

23:37.200 --> 23:43.991
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

23:46.991 --> 23:49.866
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

23:49.908 --> 23:53.158
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

23:53.200 --> 24:01.741
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

24:01.741 --> 24:06.783
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

24:06.783 --> 24:13.908
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

24:13.949 --> 24:16.991
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

24:16.991 --> 24:18.200
tomorrow you become a devil –

24:19.824 --> 24:25.908
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

24:29.158 --> 24:37.949
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

24:37.991 --> 24:41.075
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

24:42.949 --> 24:47.783
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.824
And that’s what will mature you.

25:06.866 --> 25:12.116
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

25:12.116 --> 25:14.241
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

25:14.241 --> 25:18.658
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

25:18.658 --> 25:20.741
who are innocent, simple people?

25:25.866 --> 25:30.783
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

25:30.824 --> 25:36.908
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

25:36.949 --> 25:40.116
you really lag in the action of it.

25:42.658 --> 25:45.241
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

25:45.241 --> 25:47.241
it’s like that, something happens to you.

25:51.824 --> 25:54.075
All the time you go on pinching people

25:54.075 --> 25:57.824
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

25:57.866 --> 26:00.783
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

26:00.783 --> 26:03.200
And then end up in the divorce case.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.241
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

26:07.658 --> 26:09.741
I must tell you a very interesting story.

26:09.741 --> 26:14.241
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

26:14.658 --> 26:16.033
kissing each other all the time,

26:16.033 --> 26:17.991
least bothered there are other people

26:18.033 --> 26:20.949
who are also going on the same escalator.

26:20.949 --> 26:24.908
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

26:24.908 --> 26:28.158
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

26:28.158 --> 26:31.824
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

26:31.866 --> 26:40.200
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

26:40.241 --> 26:43.824
They were not kissing.

26:43.866 --> 26:44.949
I said, “What happened?”

26:44.991 --> 26:46.741
“We are divorced.”

26:49.658 --> 26:51.741
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

26:51.783 --> 26:55.075
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

26:55.116 --> 26:57.699
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

26:58.949 --> 27:03.824
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

27:03.824 --> 27:08.824
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

27:12.949 --> 27:14.991
All the time quarrelling with each other,

27:15.033 --> 27:22.200
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

27:22.241 --> 27:27.866
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

27:27.866 --> 27:32.783
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

27:32.783 --> 27:35.116
that you should never show your emotions outside.

27:37.241 --> 27:39.699
But otherwise you can show anything else,

27:39.699 --> 27:44.699
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

27:46.075 --> 27:49.075
What an absurd place it is.

27:54.075 --> 27:56.866
You have accepted all these values

27:58.658 --> 28:01.116
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

28:06.991 --> 28:10.658
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

28:10.658 --> 28:12.866
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

28:12.908 --> 28:16.949
I will never go to these psychologists.”

28:16.991 --> 28:18.699
So I said, “Why?”

28:18.741 --> 28:21.116
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

28:22.241 --> 28:24.116
Imagine.

28:28.075 --> 28:32.033
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

28:35.783 --> 28:39.908
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

28:39.949 --> 28:41.783
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

28:43.241 --> 28:49.158
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.200
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

28:56.949 --> 29:00.866
But there’s a real objection now,

29:00.866 --> 29:03.116
that people when they go abroad,

29:03.116 --> 29:06.741
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

29:06.783 --> 29:08.658
and tease each other. What is the need?

29:09.658 --> 29:12.075
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

29:12.075 --> 29:20.158
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

29:20.200 --> 29:24.908
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

29:26.158 --> 29:29.866
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

29:29.866 --> 29:32.658
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

29:32.658 --> 29:35.991
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

29:39.699 --> 29:43.866
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

29:47.158 --> 29:50.824
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

29:50.824 --> 29:53.699
whatever you have lost, you can.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.949
That’s why the depth is lacking.

30:03.158 --> 30:06.991
And this is the reason there is no consistency

30:07.033 --> 30:11.866
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

30:14.075 --> 30:18.116
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

30:18.158 --> 30:21.741
and next day not even one, all lost.

30:22.658 --> 30:26.075
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

30:27.699 --> 30:32.658
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

30:35.116 --> 30:39.241
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

30:41.033 --> 30:43.741
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

30:43.783 --> 30:49.033
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

30:55.866 --> 31:02.991
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

31:02.991 --> 31:05.033
“that you wear such and such dress,”

31:05.075 --> 31:11.741
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

31:11.741 --> 31:14.783
I can keep the whole night awake,

31:14.824 --> 31:17.200
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

31:20.033 --> 31:24.158
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

31:28.033 --> 31:31.200
You have everything within you.

31:31.200 --> 31:36.991
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

31:36.991 --> 31:41.991
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

31:41.991 --> 31:48.658
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

31:48.658 --> 31:53.699
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

31:53.699 --> 31:55.949
I’m here to tell you all about it.

31:55.991 --> 31:59.075
You are so fortunate I am with you.

31:59.116 --> 32:01.200
Do you understand that point?

32:03.741 --> 32:05.200
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

32:05.241 --> 32:08.075
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

32:10.908 --> 32:13.241
You don’t have to do anything like that.

32:13.241 --> 32:18.699
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

32:18.699 --> 32:24.949
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

32:24.949 --> 32:28.991
in the open they used to sit for hours together

32:29.033 --> 32:33.949
Now that’s not necessary.

32:33.991 --> 32:38.991
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

32:42.949 --> 32:47.075
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

32:47.116 --> 32:54.866
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

32:56.908 --> 33:01.158
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

33:03.824 --> 33:07.158
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

33:07.158 --> 33:09.033
I told that “You better do some course.”

33:09.075 --> 33:13.200
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

33:13.241 --> 33:16.908
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

33:16.908 --> 33:20.699
and do it up and finish it.

33:20.699 --> 33:24.699
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

33:28.741 --> 33:33.741
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

33:34.908 --> 33:44.949
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

33:46.658 --> 33:49.908
we start moving towards that more and more,

33:49.949 --> 33:53.158
more and more and establishing ourselves

33:53.158 --> 33:56.158
in the ocean of that joy.

33:56.200 --> 34:02.741
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

34:02.783 --> 34:07.033
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

34:07.033 --> 34:09.991
you are very happy on the gross shore,

34:10.033 --> 34:14.033
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

34:14.075 --> 34:16.824
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

34:16.866 --> 34:21.908
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

34:23.075 --> 34:26.200
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

34:26.200 --> 34:28.783
regularly, religiously.

34:30.866 --> 34:36.033
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

34:36.075 --> 34:42.075
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

34:42.116 --> 34:46.075
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

34:46.075 --> 34:48.824
And you know what mire is,

34:48.866 --> 34:56.033
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

34:56.033 --> 34:58.991
to come out of the water.

34:58.991 --> 35:02.866
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

35:06.741 --> 35:09.866
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

35:10.783 --> 35:13.699
If you kick it, you go deeper.

35:13.699 --> 35:16.658
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

35:16.699 --> 35:20.741
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

35:20.741 --> 35:25.116
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

35:25.158 --> 35:28.783
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

35:28.783 --> 35:31.699
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

35:31.699 --> 35:34.075
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

35:34.075 --> 35:36.658
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

35:37.949 --> 35:42.908
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

35:42.949 --> 35:46.783
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

35:46.783 --> 35:55.783
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

36:00.991 --> 36:03.949
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

36:05.241 --> 36:09.033
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

36:09.033 --> 36:11.824
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

36:11.824 --> 36:15.699
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

36:15.741 --> 36:18.075
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

36:18.075 --> 36:20.075
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

36:20.116 --> 36:21.783
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

36:21.783 --> 36:24.116
The reason is, why it is said,

36:24.116 --> 36:26.824
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

36:26.866 --> 36:29.158
who is the Mother Earth,

36:30.699 --> 36:32.200
who acts through Mother Earth.

36:32.200 --> 36:37.116
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.075
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

36:42.075 --> 36:48.699
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

36:49.824 --> 36:54.033
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

36:54.033 --> 36:58.658
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

36:58.699 --> 37:02.033
Just see the Mother Earth.

37:10.991 --> 37:14.241
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

37:14.241 --> 37:17.991
and compassion has done so much for us,

37:17.991 --> 37:20.866
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

37:23.824 --> 37:28.991
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

37:28.991 --> 37:35.241
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

37:35.241 --> 37:40.241
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

37:40.658 --> 37:44.741
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

37:44.741 --> 37:48.866
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

37:55.866 --> 37:59.033
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

37:59.075 --> 38:04.991
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

38:05.033 --> 38:08.075
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

38:08.116 --> 38:12.658
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

38:17.741 --> 38:22.033
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

38:22.075 --> 38:24.949
who always tries to amuse you,

38:24.991 --> 38:27.949
always tries to say nice things,

38:27.991 --> 38:33.658
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

38:37.741 --> 38:41.949
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

38:41.991 --> 38:47.949
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

38:52.200 --> 38:56.116
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

38:56.158 --> 39:03.699
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

39:03.699 --> 39:05.783
just see and watch.

39:05.783 --> 39:10.116
How they come round with little-little hands,

39:10.158 --> 39:12.200
how they work it out.

39:15.866 --> 39:18.991
How they know what is the right thing.

39:18.991 --> 39:22.824
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

39:22.824 --> 39:25.033
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

39:27.658 --> 39:31.033
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

39:31.033 --> 39:36.991
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

39:36.991 --> 39:40.658
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

39:40.658 --> 39:45.699
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

39:45.699 --> 39:49.866
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

39:49.866 --> 39:52.824
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

39:52.866 --> 39:54.783
what you do know about my Grandmother?

39:54.824 --> 39:57.200
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

39:57.241 --> 39:59.991
and you put Her sari on the ground.

40:01.241 --> 40:07.866
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

40:07.908 --> 40:11.991
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

40:11.991 --> 40:15.824
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

40:15.866 --> 40:19.741
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

40:24.908 --> 40:33.908
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

40:40.866 --> 40:43.116
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

40:43.116 --> 40:47.075
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

40:47.116 --> 40:50.699
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

40:50.699 --> 40:52.824
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

40:52.824 --> 40:55.241
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

40:57.075 --> 41:01.658
Because again, again the same thing.

41:02.949 --> 41:05.699
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

41:05.741 --> 41:10.949
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

41:10.991 --> 41:13.783
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

41:13.824 --> 41:16.033
the same restlessness within themselves.

41:16.075 --> 41:21.116
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

41:21.116 --> 41:29.658
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

41:29.658 --> 41:32.116
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

41:32.158 --> 41:35.158
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

41:35.200 --> 41:37.949
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

41:37.949 --> 41:39.866
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

41:39.866 --> 41:43.741
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

41:47.866 --> 41:52.991
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

41:52.991 --> 41:56.658
but some of them I can tell you,

41:56.658 --> 42:02.741
that there were three of them,

42:02.783 --> 42:12.116
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

42:12.158 --> 42:14.158
about twelve o’clock on a road.

42:16.908 --> 42:22.991
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

42:22.991 --> 42:29.783
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

42:29.783 --> 42:32.033
because where should we go and stay?”

42:32.075 --> 42:37.200
I was amazed. These are the people

42:37.200 --> 42:39.866
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

42:39.866 --> 42:43.075
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

42:43.075 --> 42:46.241
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

42:46.658 --> 42:48.991
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

42:48.991 --> 42:51.866
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

42:51.866 --> 42:56.075
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

42:57.699 --> 43:01.200
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

43:01.241 --> 43:03.200
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

43:03.241 --> 43:07.200
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

43:14.908 --> 43:22.116
And the negative within us disappears

43:22.158 --> 43:25.075
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

43:29.658 --> 43:32.866
You can see it so clearly in another person.

43:34.241 --> 43:37.699
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

43:37.699 --> 43:40.699
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

43:40.699 --> 43:43.783
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

43:43.783 --> 43:45.658
very nice person, very nice person”.

43:48.741 --> 43:54.241
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

43:54.658 --> 43:58.783
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

43:58.783 --> 44:03.741
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

44:03.783 --> 44:10.866
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

44:12.241 --> 44:14.241
Even if you get your Realization,

44:14.658 --> 44:21.158
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

44:21.200 --> 44:24.116
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

44:24.158 --> 44:28.033
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

44:33.158 --> 44:36.991
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

44:37.033 --> 44:39.200
it can never give the right picture.

44:40.949 --> 44:45.658
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

44:45.699 --> 44:50.158
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

44:53.075 --> 44:57.158
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

44:57.158 --> 45:04.033
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

45:04.033 --> 45:06.741
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

45:06.741 --> 45:09.699
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

45:11.075 --> 45:16.033
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

45:16.075 --> 45:18.741
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

45:18.783 --> 45:20.241
then they want to have this.

45:20.658 --> 45:24.949
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

45:24.949 --> 45:28.783
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

45:33.741 --> 45:36.949
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

45:36.991 --> 45:39.658
and have come out and have spread light,

45:39.699 --> 45:47.699
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

45:47.699 --> 45:49.241
I’ve seen people like that.

45:53.658 --> 45:57.658
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

45:57.658 --> 46:01.158
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

46:04.991 --> 46:10.908
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

46:10.949 --> 46:14.033
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

46:17.783 --> 46:20.200
Let that be awakened within you.

46:20.200 --> 46:25.658
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

46:25.699 --> 46:32.658
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

46:32.699 --> 46:37.783
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

46:39.908 --> 46:43.158
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.991
At least you should have the taste of it.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.991
I’m telling you about something

46:52.991 --> 46:54.991
which you may not have heard before.

46:54.991 --> 46:57.741
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

46:57.783 --> 47:01.824
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

47:02.991 --> 47:08.158
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

47:08.158 --> 47:13.158
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

47:13.200 --> 47:18.116
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

47:18.116 --> 47:24.116
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

47:24.116 --> 47:29.658
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

47:29.699 --> 47:34.824
without the right time in Rome,

47:34.866 --> 47:40.075
which is one of the basic things

47:40.075 --> 47:42.908
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

47:46.658 --> 47:50.658
Romans started it and others carried on.

47:51.658 --> 48:04.699
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

48:04.741 --> 48:08.116
But the English must know

48:09.658 --> 48:14.783
that they have got such a golden land

48:14.824 --> 48:21.200
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

48:23.116 --> 48:28.075
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

48:30.241 --> 48:34.866
where even water beads also the snow –

48:34.908 --> 48:38.075
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

48:41.033 --> 48:43.783
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

48:45.241 --> 48:48.699
Who washes the feet of His Father.

48:51.158 --> 48:56.658
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

48:59.033 --> 49:04.241
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

49:07.033 --> 49:10.116
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.658
Just the opposite English were.

49:17.908 --> 49:23.033
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

49:23.033 --> 49:33.866
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

49:33.908 --> 49:37.116
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

49:44.033 --> 49:47.908
All unchaste people are arrogant.

49:48.991 --> 49:51.949
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

49:54.783 --> 49:58.075
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

49:58.075 --> 50:00.241
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

50:00.241 --> 50:03.824
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

50:14.116 --> 50:19.116
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

50:21.991 --> 50:24.741
And such a person also becomes insular

50:24.783 --> 50:30.658
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

50:35.116 --> 50:37.991
But a chaste personality is open,

50:38.033 --> 50:40.741
why should he be afraid of anyone?

50:43.033 --> 50:45.783
Talks to everyone nicely,

50:45.783 --> 50:50.783
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

50:50.824 --> 50:54.116
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

51:05.658 --> 51:13.241
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

51:13.241 --> 51:18.949
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

51:18.949 --> 51:21.033
you’ll be thrown away.

51:29.991 --> 51:36.658
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

51:36.699 --> 51:40.866
because I reside within you as chastity.

51:44.699 --> 51:48.241
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

51:48.241 --> 51:51.949
I reside within you as chastity.

51:56.116 --> 51:58.200
Chastity is never aggressive,

51:58.241 --> 52:03.699
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

52:06.824 --> 52:10.158
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

52:10.200 --> 52:12.866
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

52:12.908 --> 52:15.158
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

52:15.200 --> 52:22.075
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

52:24.658 --> 52:31.991
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

52:37.075 --> 52:39.949
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

52:39.949 --> 52:45.116
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

52:45.158 --> 52:50.658
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

52:50.658 --> 52:52.908
for these two years, very hard,

52:52.908 --> 52:55.908
real tapasya we have to go into,

52:59.158 --> 53:03.783
all of us, whether men or women.

53:09.241 --> 53:12.200
And then we’ll see.

53:14.741 --> 53:21.991
I can say that, we have done good job,

53:23.699 --> 53:30.824
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

53:31.658 --> 53:33.741
Have faith in yourself.

53:36.949 --> 53:45.658
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

53:49.658 --> 53:53.241
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

53:57.949 --> 54:00.991
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

54:01.033 --> 54:04.116
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

54:04.116 --> 54:06.908
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

54:06.908 --> 54:08.699
Why should you have faith in your wife?

54:08.699 --> 54:12.783
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

54:12.824 --> 54:18.116
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

54:18.158 --> 54:21.075
how can your child be anything else?

54:25.658 --> 54:29.741
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

54:30.991 --> 54:36.116
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

54:37.075 --> 54:44.158
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

54:45.699 --> 54:49.658
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

54:49.699 --> 54:56.949
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

54:57.658 --> 55:00.116
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

55:00.158 --> 55:02.699
in anything.

55:03.991 --> 55:07.075
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

55:07.116 --> 55:09.033
that you are emotionally attached to Me

55:09.033 --> 55:11.241
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

55:11.908 --> 55:17.033
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

55:17.075 --> 55:19.991
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

55:20.033 --> 55:23.699
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

55:27.741 --> 55:32.158
Faith is something, which is volatile

55:35.033 --> 55:40.866
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

55:43.741 --> 55:48.658
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

55:48.658 --> 55:51.241
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

55:53.908 --> 56:00.075
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

56:00.075 --> 56:08.866
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

56:09.658 --> 56:16.824
Can you believe it? What a power.

56:22.783 --> 56:27.824
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

56:30.824 --> 56:34.783
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

56:38.658 --> 56:42.824
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

56:43.949 --> 56:48.658
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

56:48.658 --> 56:51.200
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

56:51.200 --> 56:53.824
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

56:55.033 --> 56:58.866
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

56:58.908 --> 57:00.783
who are austere, not that.

57:00.824 --> 57:06.824
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

57:10.158 --> 57:17.866
which acts because it understands Me.

57:17.866 --> 57:20.658
She understands Me. She knows Me,

57:20.699 --> 57:23.158
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

57:25.741 --> 57:29.783
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

57:32.033 --> 57:36.075
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

57:36.075 --> 57:38.658
Don’t waste your energy like this;

57:38.699 --> 57:40.783
you are saints, live like saints.

57:44.949 --> 57:50.908
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

57:50.908 --> 57:55.033
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

57:55.075 --> 57:58.241
something absurd, nonsensical.

57:59.116 --> 58:01.158
We don’t have to attract anyone.

58:01.158 --> 58:05.866
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

58:06.991 --> 58:09.908
which attracts the bees,

58:11.699 --> 58:14.116
is the honey of the flower,

58:14.158 --> 58:17.866
is the essence of our existence.

58:27.908 --> 58:31.991
So this time you are all coming to India,

58:32.991 --> 58:39.908
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

58:40.908 --> 58:46.200
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

58:46.241 --> 58:48.241
and the films and all that nonsense.

58:48.241 --> 58:50.699
You are above all that.

58:56.116 --> 59:07.116
Attention, achievements are to be seen

59:09.658 --> 59:13.741
from the seat of your chastity.

59:15.741 --> 59:17.949
We can’t leave our seats,

59:18.699 --> 59:21.783
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

59:21.824 --> 59:23.075
We can’t leave our seat.

59:23.116 --> 59:27.033
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

59:27.075 --> 59:30.116
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

59:30.158 --> 59:40.741
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

59:42.783 --> 59:50.241
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

59:51.658 --> 59:57.200
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

59:57.241 --> 59:59.699
that you have acquired will drop out.

59:59.699 --> 01:00:01.241
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

01:00:05.908 --> 01:00:10.075
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

01:00:14.033 --> 01:00:17.908
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:27.200
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:35.033
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

01:00:35.075 --> 01:00:42.241
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

01:00:45.033 --> 01:00:48.241
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

01:00:54.783 --> 01:00:58.658
And when you worship Him, you must realize

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:02.699
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

01:01:02.741 --> 01:01:07.658
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:10.824
you should abhor such a person.

01:01:12.158 --> 01:01:15.908
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

01:01:15.949 --> 01:01:18.075
just have nothing to do with that person.

01:01:23.158 --> 01:01:28.741
Christ is innocence.

01:01:31.824 --> 01:01:34.908
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

01:01:34.949 --> 01:01:38.949
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

01:01:45.824 --> 01:01:49.116
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

01:01:49.116 --> 01:01:51.200
so that you never recognize Him.

01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:05.033
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

01:02:05.033 --> 01:02:10.033
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

01:02:10.075 --> 01:02:15.200
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

01:02:15.241 --> 01:02:17.741
Try to be meditative. See things.

01:02:17.741 --> 01:02:20.949
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:33.033
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

01:02:33.033 --> 01:02:41.158
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:44.949
if possible day after tomorrow evening

01:02:46.991 --> 01:02:54.116
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

01:02:55.699 --> 01:03:08.824
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

01:03:08.824 --> 01:03:11.116
I really work very hard,

01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:13.991
you have no idea how much I work hard.

01:03:14.033 --> 01:03:18.866
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

01:03:18.866 --> 01:03:21.200
that others should do all their work.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.741
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

01:03:25.783 --> 01:03:31.116
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

01:03:31.158 --> 01:03:34.075
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

01:03:34.116 --> 01:03:35.866
She should do meditation.

01:03:41.741 --> 01:03:44.116
There is no saving.

01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:49.991
You can save everything else if you just know

01:03:50.033 --> 01:03:56.741
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

01:03:56.741 --> 01:03:59.824
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

01:04:01.033 --> 01:04:03.158
But first save yourself.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.824
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

01:04:11.075 --> 01:04:15.200
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

01:04:15.241 --> 01:04:21.075
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

01:04:21.075 --> 01:04:24.783
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

01:04:24.783 --> 01:04:27.200
Everyone can work it out.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.658
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:33.200
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

01:04:34.908 --> 01:04:38.033
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

01:04:40.741 --> 01:04:42.824
I am thankful that all the people

01:04:42.866 --> 01:04:45.908
have come from all over England.

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:49.116
It was right thing to do it in a way,

01:04:50.783 --> 01:04:55.241
but this country must be created of that level

01:04:56.033 --> 01:04:59.783
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:05.699
On the contrary it should not happen

01:05:05.741 --> 01:05:07.075
that once they come to England,

01:05:07.116 --> 01:05:09.075
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:09.991 --> 01:05:18.200
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.991
that people have may be that it might become like that,

01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:24.200
that once they come here they’ll say,

01:05:24.241 --> 01:05:26.783
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

01:05:29.241 --> 01:05:33.158
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

01:05:34.741 --> 01:05:38.200
I have known some people that they came to England

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.116
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

01:05:41.158 --> 01:05:44.949
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

01:05:44.991 --> 01:05:46.075
“Mother nothing doing,

01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:48.783
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

01:05:48.783 --> 01:05:52.699
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:54.783
where you have worked for twelve years.”

01:05:57.991 --> 01:06:05.741
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

01:06:07.033 --> 01:06:12.075
and we have certain debts to be paid,

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.116
to be born in this country,

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:23.116
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

01:06:26.158 --> 01:06:30.033
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

01:06:30.033 --> 01:06:34.824
When you say that, “shut that window,”

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.824
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

01:06:38.866 --> 01:06:42.241
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

01:06:48.116 --> 01:06:53.116
Make others work is not the way.

01:06:53.116 --> 01:06:55.949
You have to be really very dedicated.

01:06:55.991 --> 01:06:59.741
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

01:06:59.741 --> 01:07:02.949
Don’t look at other people who are here.

01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:05.824
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:16.200
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.824
and that you have a special responsibility.

01:07:22.783 --> 01:07:27.158
So may God bless you.

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:21.866
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

01:08:21.866 --> 01:08:27.699
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

01:08:28.658 --> 01:08:32.158
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

01:08:32.158 --> 01:08:34.908
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

01:08:36.741 --> 01:08:41.283
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

01:08:44.075 --> 01:08:50.658
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

01:08:52.699 --> 01:08:56.033
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

01:08:56.033 --> 01:09:02.200
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

01:09:05.158 --> 01:09:15.116
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

01:09:15.116 --> 01:09:18.866
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:30.033
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

01:09:30.075 --> 01:09:37.908
Through your punyas it should be.

01:09:38.824 --> 01:09:54.158
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:58.116
through your punyas only.

01:10:05.949 --> 01:10:12.741
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:17.908
The people who have to worship, we have to see

01:10:17.908 --> 01:10:20.699
who are the people who have to worship.

01:10:23.866 --> 01:10:25.908
Very difficult situation.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:05.033
Get the small children, that’s the best.

01:11:06.241 --> 01:11:08.866
Come along. Nira. Come along.

01:11:13.075 --> 01:11:18.783
Yes, yes you both come along.

01:11:20.658 --> 01:11:30.116
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

01:11:49.866 --> 01:11:52.949
All of them should be below ten years.

01:12:05.866 --> 01:12:08.949
Not below two but below ten.

01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:11.949
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:36.824
Very good children, must say.

01:12:36.824 --> 01:12:38.908
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

01:12:38.908 --> 01:12:45.741
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

01:12:45.741 --> 01:12:48.908
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

01:12:48.908 --> 01:12:51.158
and you just have to rub. Alright.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:53.741
Come along, four at the time.

01:12:53.741 --> 01:12:55.116
Now who are the four?

01:12:55.158 --> 01:12:58.824
She will put the water,

01:12:58.824 --> 01:13:01.949
you rub, now you rub It,

01:13:01.949 --> 01:13:04.824
you rub My Foot.
