00:00:02.147 --> 00:00:07.336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:22.632
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:26.651
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:29.877
I don’t know what to say.

00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:36.100
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.038
because most of you come from a culture

00:02:41.198 --> 00:02:44.968
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

00:02:45.128 --> 00:02:49.066
They never realised how important it was that,

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:53.415
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

00:02:55.088 --> 00:03:00.159
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

00:03:02.503 --> 00:03:10.370
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:16.034
And also the desire to know the Divine

00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:27.948
vanishes also in the thin air

00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:34.503
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:39.971
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:49.299
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:54.370
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:03.330
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:09.601
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:23.948
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:29.893
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.412
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

00:04:38.572 --> 00:04:42.499
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.171
and entertained us the most.

00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.608
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

00:04:48.768 --> 00:04:53.594
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:57.495
and they think that you are laughing at them.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:08.667
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.217
was more than what one would expect

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:20.487
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

00:05:20.647 --> 00:05:26.511
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:28.968
that made us so happy.

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:35.605
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

00:05:35.765 --> 00:05:42.570
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:48.433
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

00:05:48.593 --> 00:05:52.515
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:59.011
His manifestation within you is so evident.

00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:04.351
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

00:06:04.796 --> 00:06:07.343
so very different from other people.

00:06:08.436 --> 00:06:11.804
One day I was travelling from London

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.190
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.573
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:31.475
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

00:06:32.147 --> 00:06:37.026
I asked her, “Who are you?”

00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:41.057
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:46.839
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:49.874
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.374
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:02.792
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:06.147
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.796
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

00:07:15.897 --> 00:07:19.819
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

00:07:20.163 --> 00:07:22.972
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:28.065
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

00:07:28.225 --> 00:07:30.991
He’s not talked about the source.

00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:37.515
I said, “Better find out,

00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:42.440
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.300
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.421
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

00:07:53.483 --> 00:08:00.202
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.175
and not by the Father.

00:08:02.335 --> 00:08:05.269
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:10.690
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.136
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:25.905
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:30.983
also about the Jews.

00:08:32.038 --> 00:08:37.417
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:39.975
nor about Shri Ganesh.

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:49.144
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

00:08:49.304 --> 00:08:56.964
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

00:08:57.124 --> 00:09:02.765
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.401
So now, when we deal with our children,

00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:16.448
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

00:09:16.608 --> 00:09:20.889
they are very innocent, very simple;

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:26.909
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:29.764
and they lose their moorings.

00:09:33.624 --> 00:09:40.636
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:45.702
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:53.437
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:58.577
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

00:09:59.857 --> 00:10:05.831
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:09.288
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

00:10:10.061 --> 00:10:13.717
But you should know He is on every chakra.

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:24.284
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

00:10:24.444 --> 00:10:26.717
specially the spiritual one.

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:32.241
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:38.296
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:45.827
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

00:10:46.702 --> 00:10:55.585
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

00:10:57.171 --> 00:11:04.293
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:06.147
It was Sahaj.

00:11:06.772 --> 00:11:13.276
The life before Self-realisation was different.

00:11:13.436 --> 00:11:15.791
You got your transformation

00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:25.842
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

00:11:26.878 --> 00:11:29.378
But here now we have to see

00:11:29.538 --> 00:11:34.628
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

00:11:34.788 --> 00:11:39.567
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

00:11:39.727 --> 00:11:47.948
you have to cure people, you have to love them

00:11:48.108 --> 00:11:50.714
and you have to be compassionate

00:11:50.874 --> 00:11:58.675
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

00:11:58.835 --> 00:12:03.480
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:13.087
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

00:12:13.258 --> 00:12:15.977
You can project it to others.

00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:24.289
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:31.313
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.471
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:41.291
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:44.822
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

00:12:44.982 --> 00:12:49.479
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.580
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.924
This is what you have to practise,

00:12:55.084 --> 00:13:01.498
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

00:13:01.669 --> 00:13:07.251
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.807
Now, for example, say

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:20.851
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:24.768
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

00:13:24.928 --> 00:13:30.471
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

00:13:30.631 --> 00:13:34.865
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

00:13:36.295 --> 00:13:44.084
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:52.205
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

00:13:52.365 --> 00:13:58.935
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.936
Not very difficult.

00:14:02.287 --> 00:14:07.065
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:13.030
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

00:14:15.481 --> 00:14:18.354
The energy will diminish.

00:14:18.514 --> 00:14:25.467
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

00:14:26.568 --> 00:14:32.415
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

00:14:32.575 --> 00:14:34.899
you are not ordinary people

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:40.372
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:50.118
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:53.770
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

00:14:55.137 --> 00:14:58.891
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:04.947
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

00:15:05.107 --> 00:15:08.383
or how to deliberately do this.

00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:11.618
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:15.235
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

00:15:15.395 --> 00:15:27.571
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:31.778
but just your majestic personality.

00:15:32.793 --> 00:15:36.637
This personality is here now, you see,

00:15:37.535 --> 00:15:41.277
is sitting in such a majestic manner

00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:48.563
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:58.028
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.157
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

00:16:05.317 --> 00:16:08.520
I don’t think is alright.

00:16:08.825 --> 00:16:14.094
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

00:16:14.254 --> 00:16:17.621
so much ego, so much conditioning.

00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:25.438
But something within you can rise above others

00:16:25.598 --> 00:16:36.020
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

00:16:36.457 --> 00:16:38.688
where you stand with yourself.

00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:42.625
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:47.430
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:55.637
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

00:16:55.886 --> 00:17:00.904
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

00:17:01.064 --> 00:17:07.673
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

00:17:08.446 --> 00:17:11.284
But the innocence that you have,

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:17.311
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:24.533
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

00:17:24.693 --> 00:17:28.501
you are not properly dressed up

00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:32.037
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

00:17:32.197 --> 00:17:35.303
that they expect every other person to be.

00:17:35.463 --> 00:17:38.497
It’s a funny thing that in this world

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:42.006
all human beings expect others to be very good.

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:44.483
Everybody should be a hero or something

00:17:44.643 --> 00:17:47.334
– what about themselves they never think!

00:17:47.494 --> 00:17:50.686
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

00:17:50.846 --> 00:17:54.749
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

00:17:54.909 --> 00:18:00.366
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

00:18:00.526 --> 00:18:05.217
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:08.420
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:14.038
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

00:18:14.198 --> 00:18:20.303
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

00:18:20.463 --> 00:18:22.432
as a child does.

00:18:22.885 --> 00:18:28.561
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

00:18:28.721 --> 00:18:32.913
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

00:18:33.073 --> 00:18:38.842
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

00:18:39.002 --> 00:18:43.389
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:51.994
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

00:18:52.502 --> 00:18:57.905
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

00:18:58.065 --> 00:19:02.049
the whole world get worried about it,

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:06.147
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

00:19:06.307 --> 00:19:12.483
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

00:19:12.643 --> 00:19:16.631
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:20.874
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:26.780
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.374
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

00:19:31.534 --> 00:19:35.901
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:44.678
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

00:19:44.838 --> 00:19:47.197
but just spontaneously.

00:19:48.065 --> 00:19:55.280
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.178
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

00:19:59.338 --> 00:20:02.178
You can’t run away from the society.

00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:10.229
You start getting all the rapport with such people

00:20:10.588 --> 00:20:14.976
who are talking about things

00:20:15.136 --> 00:20:19.131
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:23.299
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

00:20:24.752 --> 00:20:28.538
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

00:20:28.698 --> 00:20:34.542
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

00:20:36.424 --> 00:20:43.311
In the sense that – when I was in London

00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:47.905
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

00:20:48.065 --> 00:20:51.905
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

00:20:52.065 --> 00:20:54.033
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

00:20:54.194 --> 00:20:57.788
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

00:20:57.948 --> 00:21:00.913
all the married women have to wear this.

00:21:01.073 --> 00:21:06.397
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:08.139
So I said that,

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:12.655
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:16.108
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

00:21:16.268 --> 00:21:22.518
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

00:21:23.541 --> 00:21:28.452
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

00:21:28.612 --> 00:21:33.717
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:38.416
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

00:21:38.963 --> 00:21:42.225
For the innocence, I think

00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:47.455
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

00:21:49.611 --> 00:21:53.741
And that’s how it is a society, today,

00:21:53.901 --> 00:22:00.186
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:02.202
Every individual is separate,

00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:06.616
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

00:22:06.776 --> 00:22:12.983
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

00:22:13.143 --> 00:22:17.397
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

00:22:17.557 --> 00:22:20.842
or greed behind the whole thing.

00:22:21.002 --> 00:22:26.499
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

00:22:26.659 --> 00:22:32.038
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

00:22:32.198 --> 00:22:35.553
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

00:22:35.713 --> 00:22:40.557
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:46.545
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:50.030
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.920
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.764
“What will they misunderstand?”

00:22:54.924 --> 00:22:58.991
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

00:22:59.151 --> 00:23:01.827
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

00:23:01.987 --> 00:23:05.553
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

00:23:05.713 --> 00:23:10.092
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

00:23:10.252 --> 00:23:14.991
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:17.553
But then I noticed it’s too much

00:23:17.713 --> 00:23:21.616
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

00:23:21.776 --> 00:23:24.764
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

00:23:24.924 --> 00:23:28.584
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

00:23:28.744 --> 00:23:32.053
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:41.725
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

00:23:41.885 --> 00:23:49.268
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

00:23:49.518 --> 00:23:54.420
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.647
I just can’t understand how they accept.

00:23:56.807 --> 00:24:02.377
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.397
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

00:24:07.557 --> 00:24:11.053
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

00:24:11.213 --> 00:24:15.811
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:21.639
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:27.069
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

00:24:27.229 --> 00:24:32.299
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:37.223
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

00:24:37.383 --> 00:24:39.552
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:43.006
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:47.452
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:50.642
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

00:24:50.802 --> 00:24:55.517
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

00:24:55.969 --> 00:25:01.143
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:05.311
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:13.564
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

00:25:13.724 --> 00:25:17.631
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

00:25:17.791 --> 00:25:23.644
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

00:25:23.804 --> 00:25:27.608
but every time you see something you find

00:25:27.768 --> 00:25:32.272
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:35.999
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:43.307
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

00:25:44.557 --> 00:25:49.585
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

00:25:49.745 --> 00:25:51.749
I don’t understand.

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:55.991
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:59.436
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

00:25:59.596 --> 00:26:01.616
“So what? What’s wrong?”

00:26:01.776 --> 00:26:05.561
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

00:26:05.721 --> 00:26:09.366
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:14.795
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

00:26:14.955 --> 00:26:19.881
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:26.186
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:31.147
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

00:26:31.307 --> 00:26:36.745
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.405
you should be very careful,

00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:42.341
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:46.651
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

00:26:48.127 --> 00:26:56.694
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

00:26:56.854 --> 00:27:03.081
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

00:27:05.612 --> 00:27:09.874
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

00:27:10.034 --> 00:27:17.268
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:23.420
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.506
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:32.030
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.928
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:42.084
how He has made their attention so beautiful

00:27:42.244 --> 00:27:46.420
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.916
all the innocent things of the world.”

00:27:50.252 --> 00:27:54.975
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

00:27:55.135 --> 00:27:58.335
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

00:27:58.495 --> 00:28:00.061
There are many who are struggling

00:28:00.221 --> 00:28:05.538
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

00:28:05.698 --> 00:28:09.587
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

00:28:09.746 --> 00:28:13.294
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

00:28:13.455 --> 00:28:16.741
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

00:28:16.901 --> 00:28:21.479
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

00:28:23.213 --> 00:28:27.374
That shows that there are so many people still

00:28:27.534 --> 00:28:33.069
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:34.828
and they want to enjoy it.

00:28:34.988 --> 00:28:38.327
But a society has to be created of that kind.

00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:43.717
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

00:28:43.877 --> 00:28:51.088
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:54.305
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

00:28:54.465 --> 00:28:57.372
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

00:28:57.532 --> 00:29:02.460
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.401
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:11.186
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

00:29:11.346 --> 00:29:15.905
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

00:29:16.065 --> 00:29:19.780
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:26.499
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

00:29:26.659 --> 00:29:30.319
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:32.691
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

00:29:32.851 --> 00:29:35.936
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

00:29:36.096 --> 00:29:38.452
And one of them then turned around and said,

00:29:38.612 --> 00:29:42.053
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:44.295
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

00:29:44.455 --> 00:29:47.124
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

00:29:47.284 --> 00:29:52.413
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

00:29:52.573 --> 00:29:56.249
you have to project now, to project towards others.

00:29:56.409 --> 00:30:00.147
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

00:30:00.307 --> 00:30:03.139
just with one glance you can put that person right,

00:30:03.299 --> 00:30:08.639
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:11.940
In a way that’s a projection.

00:30:12.815 --> 00:30:16.827
Around your society, around where you are working,

00:30:16.987 --> 00:30:22.131
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

00:30:22.291 --> 00:30:25.460
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:31.295
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

00:30:31.455 --> 00:30:35.139
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:39.295
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

00:30:39.455 --> 00:30:42.561
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

00:30:42.721 --> 00:30:46.506
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

00:30:46.666 --> 00:30:51.022
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:54.788
You have those qualities within you

00:30:54.948 --> 00:30:58.264
because potentially you had them before

00:30:58.424 --> 00:31:02.663
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

00:31:02.823 --> 00:31:06.792
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:14.186
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

00:31:14.346 --> 00:31:18.436
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

00:31:18.596 --> 00:31:23.256
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

00:31:23.416 --> 00:31:26.991
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:30.827
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

00:31:30.987 --> 00:31:36.811
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:40.592
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

00:31:40.752 --> 00:31:45.788
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

00:31:45.948 --> 00:31:49.417
It is not a coincidence we should say.

00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:55.342
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

00:31:55.502 --> 00:31:58.928
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:02.631
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

00:32:02.791 --> 00:32:05.895
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

00:32:06.055 --> 00:32:09.635
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:13.787
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

00:32:13.947 --> 00:32:16.249
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

00:32:16.409 --> 00:32:19.550
He put them under the seat and did all that.

00:32:20.776 --> 00:32:26.545
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

00:32:26.705 --> 00:32:30.478
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

00:32:31.955 --> 00:32:35.936
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:38.660
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.530
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.545
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

00:32:46.705 --> 00:32:48.991
You see, it is the power that you have.

00:32:49.151 --> 00:32:53.971
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

00:32:54.268 --> 00:33:01.541
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

00:33:01.807 --> 00:33:05.479
You see, how children understand love.

00:33:05.814 --> 00:33:11.392
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

00:33:11.552 --> 00:33:17.330
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

00:33:17.807 --> 00:33:22.569
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:27.280
and they were very troublesome to begin with

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.227
and the parents were worried about them.

00:33:30.387 --> 00:33:32.729
They sent them to Dharamsala

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.764
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

00:33:37.924 --> 00:33:41.436
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

00:33:41.596 --> 00:33:46.147
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

00:33:46.307 --> 00:33:49.124
they came back and the parents asked them,

00:33:49.284 --> 00:33:52.062
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

00:33:52.222 --> 00:33:55.212
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

00:33:55.372 --> 00:33:58.233
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

00:33:58.393 --> 00:34:04.276
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

00:34:05.557 --> 00:34:08.274
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

00:34:08.434 --> 00:34:13.139
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

00:34:13.299 --> 00:34:16.670
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.038
We are not bothered.”

00:34:18.198 --> 00:34:21.077
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

00:34:21.237 --> 00:34:23.499
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.210
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.249
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:34.374
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

00:34:34.534 --> 00:34:38.367
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:43.675
Very much satisfied, dignified.

00:34:44.612 --> 00:34:49.062
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

00:34:49.222 --> 00:34:51.983
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

00:34:52.143 --> 00:34:54.885
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:57.668
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

00:34:57.828 --> 00:35:02.397
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

00:35:02.557 --> 00:35:06.034
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

00:35:06.542 --> 00:35:08.944
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

00:35:09.104 --> 00:35:12.726
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

00:35:12.886 --> 00:35:20.696
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

00:35:21.479 --> 00:35:24.405
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

00:35:24.565 --> 00:35:26.765
but I have not been with them for a long time,

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:29.275
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

00:35:29.435 --> 00:35:33.753
but look at the love that they have.

00:35:33.979 --> 00:35:37.265
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

00:35:37.425 --> 00:35:40.343
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

00:35:40.503 --> 00:35:42.554
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

00:35:42.714 --> 00:35:45.796
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

00:35:45.956 --> 00:35:50.366
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

00:35:50.526 --> 00:35:57.140
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:03.437
and so much they admire, they want it.

00:36:03.597 --> 00:36:09.522
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

00:36:09.682 --> 00:36:14.500
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.627
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

00:36:18.787 --> 00:36:22.116
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

00:36:22.276 --> 00:36:26.280
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.129
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

00:36:28.289 --> 00:36:31.101
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

00:36:31.261 --> 00:36:36.972
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

00:36:38.378 --> 00:36:41.358
and we enjoyed all that very much.

00:36:41.518 --> 00:36:48.034
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

00:36:49.533 --> 00:36:54.999
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

00:36:55.159 --> 00:37:00.011
creating something sweet of this kind.

00:37:00.222 --> 00:37:05.116
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

00:37:05.276 --> 00:37:12.288
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

00:37:12.448 --> 00:37:17.226
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

00:37:17.386 --> 00:37:20.811
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:24.015
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:26.733
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

00:37:26.893 --> 00:37:31.022
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:36.046
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:40.601
so they got equipped from within.

00:37:40.761 --> 00:37:45.327
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

00:37:45.487 --> 00:37:49.210
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:56.694
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

00:37:56.854 --> 00:37:59.624
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

00:37:59.784 --> 00:38:02.874
also know that we have to give it to others.

00:38:03.034 --> 00:38:07.397
We have to pour this into others.

00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:10.882
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:14.835
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

00:38:14.995 --> 00:38:20.163
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

00:38:20.323 --> 00:38:25.108
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

00:38:25.268 --> 00:38:29.374
And Shiva had to cut His head

00:38:29.534 --> 00:38:34.022
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

00:38:34.182 --> 00:38:40.044
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:44.226
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:48.835
because in innocence you become a person

00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:52.405
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

00:38:52.565 --> 00:38:56.703
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

00:38:56.863 --> 00:39:02.472
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

00:39:03.276 --> 00:39:09.085
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

00:39:09.245 --> 00:39:10.655
There was a king in China.

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:14.476
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

00:39:14.636 --> 00:39:24.976
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

00:39:25.136 --> 00:39:29.409
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:33.366
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

00:39:33.526 --> 00:39:38.499
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:40.601
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

00:39:40.761 --> 00:39:46.640
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.392
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

00:39:51.552 --> 00:39:54.228
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

00:39:54.388 --> 00:39:58.228
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

00:39:58.388 --> 00:40:01.962
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

00:40:02.122 --> 00:40:10.067
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

00:40:10.403 --> 00:40:13.505
So all the cocks were together.

00:40:14.052 --> 00:40:18.251
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

00:40:18.411 --> 00:40:21.634
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:24.864
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

00:40:25.024 --> 00:40:27.126
he was just standing straight.

00:40:27.286 --> 00:40:31.790
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:37.111
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:41.439
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:45.118
where they were having these fights.

00:40:45.278 --> 00:40:49.591
And this was the only cock which stood up.

00:40:49.763 --> 00:40:55.454
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

00:40:55.614 --> 00:41:00.126
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

00:41:00.286 --> 00:41:04.492
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

00:41:04.653 --> 00:41:07.877
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

00:41:08.037 --> 00:41:12.337
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

00:41:12.497 --> 00:41:17.079
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:22.841
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:32.435
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

00:41:32.595 --> 00:41:35.658
if you take to your innocence.

00:41:36.087 --> 00:41:40.982
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

00:41:41.142 --> 00:41:46.525
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.489
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

00:41:50.649 --> 00:41:52.888
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

00:41:53.048 --> 00:41:55.747
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

00:41:55.907 --> 00:41:58.021
It rained so much so that they said,

00:41:58.181 --> 00:42:03.075
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

00:42:03.235 --> 00:42:05.472
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:11.106
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

00:42:11.266 --> 00:42:17.306
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

00:42:17.837 --> 00:42:24.833
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

00:42:24.993 --> 00:42:30.126
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

00:42:30.368 --> 00:42:34.138
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

00:42:34.298 --> 00:42:39.661
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

00:42:39.821 --> 00:42:45.744
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

00:42:45.904 --> 00:42:50.988
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

00:42:51.148 --> 00:42:56.036
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

00:42:56.196 --> 00:43:09.791
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:12.285
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

00:43:12.445 --> 00:43:17.442
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

00:43:17.602 --> 00:43:24.185
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:30.456
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

00:43:30.616 --> 00:43:34.198
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

00:43:34.358 --> 00:43:37.995
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

00:43:38.155 --> 00:43:42.987
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

00:43:43.147 --> 00:43:47.471
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:52.745
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

00:43:52.905 --> 00:43:56.034
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

00:43:56.194 --> 00:44:00.643
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

00:44:00.803 --> 00:44:08.350
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

00:44:09.006 --> 00:44:12.102
How He guides you and how He helps you.

00:44:12.262 --> 00:44:14.507
How He takes you to [the] right path.

00:44:14.667 --> 00:44:17.116
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

00:44:17.276 --> 00:44:22.491
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

00:44:22.651 --> 00:44:27.085
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

00:44:27.245 --> 00:44:32.210
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:36.577
He takes you to the righteous road.

00:44:36.737 --> 00:44:40.772
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

00:44:40.932 --> 00:44:43.483
You always meet friends here and there.

00:44:43.643 --> 00:44:45.897
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

00:44:46.057 --> 00:44:48.499
And that is how He works.

00:44:48.659 --> 00:44:58.233
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

00:44:58.393 --> 00:45:00.874
because you are His ganas.

00:45:01.034 --> 00:45:03.917
But the ganas have to work!

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.658
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

00:45:10.845 --> 00:45:19.303
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

00:45:19.463 --> 00:45:25.413
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

00:45:25.573 --> 00:45:28.483
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:31.944
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

00:45:32.104 --> 00:45:35.018
He gives you all the good time.

00:45:35.963 --> 00:45:38.382
Then what are we doing about it?

00:45:38.542 --> 00:45:43.710
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:47.472
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:51.897
What can we do as antibodies?

00:45:52.057 --> 00:46:03.809
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:10.832
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:17.454
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:20.040
You may melt away many people.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:27.212
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

00:46:27.372 --> 00:46:32.024
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

00:46:32.184 --> 00:46:35.780
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:40.639
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.498
Because you are so powerful.

00:46:43.659 --> 00:46:46.750
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

00:46:46.911 --> 00:46:52.188
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

00:46:52.348 --> 00:46:55.618
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

00:46:55.778 --> 00:46:59.782
And all that works out so well.

00:46:59.942 --> 00:47:03.462
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

00:47:03.622 --> 00:47:09.478
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

00:47:09.638 --> 00:47:12.661
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:12.918 --> 00:47:17.806
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

00:47:17.966 --> 00:47:20.966
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

00:47:22.317 --> 00:47:25.767
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

00:47:25.927 --> 00:47:29.591
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

00:47:30.333 --> 00:47:34.220
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.759
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

00:47:37.919 --> 00:47:40.556
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

00:47:40.716 --> 00:47:45.431
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:50.795
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

00:47:52.099 --> 00:47:55.103
But you are not to feel any strain.

00:47:55.263 --> 00:47:59.509
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

00:47:59.669 --> 00:48:02.439
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

00:48:02.599 --> 00:48:04.884
– confidence and faith in yourself.

00:48:05.044 --> 00:48:10.001
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

00:48:10.161 --> 00:48:13.895
which is nothing but compassion and love.

00:48:15.098 --> 00:48:16.978
If you have that faith

00:48:17.138 --> 00:48:22.474
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

00:48:24.012 --> 00:48:32.052
of having [a] relationship with others.

00:48:33.716 --> 00:48:41.200
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:45.731
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

00:48:46.903 --> 00:48:50.595
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

00:48:50.755 --> 00:48:53.978
I have never got into a fury or a temper

00:48:54.138 --> 00:48:56.321
because I think I can manage without it.

00:48:56.481 --> 00:49:00.345
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

00:49:00.505 --> 00:49:05.423
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

00:49:05.583 --> 00:49:10.009
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:10.169 --> 00:49:12.931
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:16.274
it is such an energy-giving thing,

00:49:16.434 --> 00:49:25.934
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

00:49:27.387 --> 00:49:29.962
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

00:49:30.122 --> 00:49:36.212
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

00:49:36.372 --> 00:49:40.993
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

00:49:41.153 --> 00:49:45.079
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:47.106
that you can’t leave.

00:49:47.763 --> 00:49:53.353
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

00:49:53.513 --> 00:49:55.536
they don’t know how the child is lost.

00:49:55.696 --> 00:50:01.971
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

00:50:02.131 --> 00:50:07.407
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:10.259
But when they are young, they are innocent

00:50:10.419 --> 00:50:14.907
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

00:50:15.067 --> 00:50:20.446
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

00:50:20.606 --> 00:50:24.626
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

00:50:24.786 --> 00:50:31.266
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

00:50:31.426 --> 00:50:35.844
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

00:50:36.004 --> 00:50:39.673
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

00:50:39.833 --> 00:50:45.798
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:48.993
that your children are looked after.

00:50:49.153 --> 00:50:52.368
But you are also a child of your Mother.

00:50:52.528 --> 00:50:56.884
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

00:50:57.044 --> 00:51:03.274
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

00:51:03.434 --> 00:51:06.876
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

00:51:07.036 --> 00:51:11.837
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

00:51:11.997 --> 00:51:13.860
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.376
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

00:51:17.536 --> 00:51:19.391
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:19.552 --> 00:51:23.035
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

00:51:23.196 --> 00:51:31.598
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.509
Today is to celebrate His birth

00:51:36.669 --> 00:51:42.095
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

00:51:42.255 --> 00:51:48.122
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

00:51:48.778 --> 00:51:53.556
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

00:51:53.716 --> 00:52:00.185
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

00:52:00.833 --> 00:52:04.099
And that’s why He was first created.

00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:09.962
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

00:52:10.122 --> 00:52:13.513
so that He can look after all the people

00:52:13.927 --> 00:52:21.552
who are going to come from ages to ages,

00:52:21.974 --> 00:52:26.537
to guide them always on the right path.

00:52:26.723 --> 00:52:31.478
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

00:52:31.638 --> 00:52:35.806
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

00:52:35.966 --> 00:52:38.517
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

00:52:38.677 --> 00:52:40.626
That I should have not done.”

00:52:40.786 --> 00:52:46.118
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

00:52:46.278 --> 00:52:49.462
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

00:52:49.622 --> 00:52:52.954
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

00:52:53.114 --> 00:52:56.884
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

00:52:57.044 --> 00:53:00.743
“Why did you give up your land?”

00:53:00.903 --> 00:53:04.954
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

00:53:05.114 --> 00:53:09.436
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

00:53:09.596 --> 00:53:13.619
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

00:53:13.779 --> 00:53:15.696
So I thought it’s better to give up.

00:53:15.856 --> 00:53:18.267
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

00:53:18.427 --> 00:53:22.622
And he so innocently was telling me that,

00:53:23.059 --> 00:53:28.829
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

00:53:28.989 --> 00:53:31.931
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

00:53:32.091 --> 00:53:36.329
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

00:53:36.489 --> 00:53:38.335
But I said, “What about your brother?”

00:53:38.496 --> 00:53:41.981
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

00:53:42.141 --> 00:53:45.071
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

00:53:45.231 --> 00:53:49.454
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

00:53:49.614 --> 00:53:52.610
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.439
Later on I might become a bad man.”

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:59.250
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:01.962
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

00:54:02.122 --> 00:54:06.680
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.189
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:12.767
I don’t know what to do.

00:54:12.927 --> 00:54:16.103
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

00:54:16.263 --> 00:54:22.076
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

00:54:22.669 --> 00:54:25.540
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:29.704
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

00:54:29.864 --> 00:54:34.009
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

00:54:34.169 --> 00:54:40.024
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

00:54:40.184 --> 00:54:43.720
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:48.087
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

00:54:48.247 --> 00:54:50.931
So he can save me from the smoking.”

00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:55.454
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

00:54:55.614 --> 00:54:58.329
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

00:54:58.489 --> 00:55:01.884
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

00:55:02.044 --> 00:55:06.540
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:11.165
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

00:55:11.325 --> 00:55:15.782
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

00:55:15.942 --> 00:55:20.039
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

00:55:20.199 --> 00:55:25.427
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:30.970
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:35.759
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

00:55:35.919 --> 00:55:41.392
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

00:55:41.552 --> 00:55:47.110
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.931
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:54.079
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

00:55:54.239 --> 00:55:58.595
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

00:55:58.755 --> 00:56:03.056
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

00:56:03.216 --> 00:56:06.040
For example, I have never seen such honest people

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:09.860
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.642
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

00:56:13.802 --> 00:56:16.673
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

00:56:16.833 --> 00:56:19.595
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

00:56:19.755 --> 00:56:23.345
but most of you have become so honest.

00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:26.204
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

00:56:26.364 --> 00:56:30.216
and to see people who are so honest.

00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:34.162
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

00:56:34.322 --> 00:56:39.040
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.997
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

00:56:45.207 --> 00:56:50.821
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:55.387
how you people are so much fond of me.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:06.970
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:10.173
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

00:57:10.333 --> 00:57:13.704
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

00:57:13.864 --> 00:57:15.860
Because He’s so attached to me

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:19.767
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

00:57:19.927 --> 00:57:21.689
That’s what you are.

00:57:21.849 --> 00:57:24.032
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

00:57:24.192 --> 00:57:28.048
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

00:57:28.208 --> 00:57:32.899
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

00:57:33.059 --> 00:57:39.665
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

00:57:39.825 --> 00:57:42.774
But the another quality, as I said, is that

00:57:42.934 --> 00:57:47.696
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

00:57:47.856 --> 00:57:53.423
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

00:57:53.583 --> 00:58:00.220
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:07.774
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

00:58:07.934 --> 00:58:11.249
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

00:58:11.409 --> 00:58:14.939
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

00:58:15.099 --> 00:58:20.353
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

00:58:20.513 --> 00:58:25.548
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

00:58:25.708 --> 00:58:27.954
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

00:58:28.114 --> 00:58:31.845
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

00:58:32.005 --> 00:58:37.743
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

00:58:37.903 --> 00:58:41.790
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:44.071
Nobody makes a mistake.”

00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:47.634
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

00:58:47.794 --> 00:58:52.126
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

00:58:52.286 --> 00:58:56.286
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

00:58:56.447 --> 00:59:00.564
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

00:59:00.724 --> 00:59:05.720
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.759
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

00:59:09.919 --> 00:59:14.345
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

00:59:14.505 --> 00:59:22.048
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:33.536
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

00:59:34.302 --> 00:59:38.774
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

00:59:38.934 --> 00:59:43.634
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

00:59:43.794 --> 00:59:47.345
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

00:59:47.505 --> 00:59:49.930
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:53.399
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

00:59:53.559 --> 01:00:00.306
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:06.212
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

01:00:06.372 --> 01:00:13.853
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

01:00:14.013 --> 01:00:18.759
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:26.493
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

01:00:26.653 --> 01:00:33.204
with such speed and with such lightness:

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.790
they were lifting their legs and hand.

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:41.325
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:47.532
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

01:00:47.692 --> 01:00:51.610
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:55.524
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:58.399
They earn their living, they are farmers,

01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:03.509
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

01:01:03.669 --> 01:01:07.462
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:15.821
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:19.103
or another bad things that people think

01:01:19.263 --> 01:01:22.707
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

01:01:22.867 --> 01:01:25.953
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

01:01:26.113 --> 01:01:31.696
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:33.837
in a very beautiful manner.

01:01:33.997 --> 01:01:39.884
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

01:01:40.044 --> 01:01:43.228
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

01:01:43.388 --> 01:01:49.228
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

01:01:49.388 --> 01:01:55.532
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

01:01:55.692 --> 01:02:00.884
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

01:02:01.044 --> 01:02:03.618
and think of violence and killing people?

01:02:03.778 --> 01:02:06.415
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

01:02:06.575 --> 01:02:10.423
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:15.439
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:21.931
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

01:02:22.091 --> 01:02:26.165
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:32.079
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:34.360
There is no need for us to fight.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:38.915
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

01:02:39.075 --> 01:02:42.696
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

01:02:42.856 --> 01:02:45.876
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

01:02:46.036 --> 01:02:48.587
He’ll either become a transformed person

01:02:48.747 --> 01:02:52.763
or he will not be there to trouble you.

01:02:53.598 --> 01:02:58.720
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.122
and our powers.

01:03:02.591 --> 01:03:06.923
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:12.106
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:17.001
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:20.661
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

01:03:20.934 --> 01:03:22.449
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:25.812
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

01:03:25.973 --> 01:03:28.032
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

01:03:28.192 --> 01:03:31.040
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.431
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

01:03:36.591 --> 01:03:42.360
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.868
You can do it, everything. You can.

01:03:45.028 --> 01:03:49.259
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

01:03:49.419 --> 01:03:54.103
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:56.454
you are not going to spoil anybody,

01:03:56.614 --> 01:04:01.485
but your power itself will show that this power

01:04:01.645 --> 01:04:10.040
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.235
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

01:04:13.395 --> 01:04:19.161
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

01:04:19.363 --> 01:04:24.751
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

01:04:24.911 --> 01:04:32.411
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

01:04:33.192 --> 01:04:38.868
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

01:04:39.028 --> 01:04:42.899
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:46.134
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

01:04:46.294 --> 01:04:50.189
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:53.962
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

01:04:54.122 --> 01:04:57.024
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.730
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

01:04:59.891 --> 01:05:03.063
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

01:05:03.224 --> 01:05:06.314
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

01:05:06.474 --> 01:05:10.040
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.243
and they are sitting there and fighting,

01:05:12.403 --> 01:05:16.079
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

01:05:16.239 --> 01:05:20.383
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:23.556
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

01:05:23.716 --> 01:05:25.290
So there were four tiers.

01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:29.290
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:31.649
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

01:05:31.809 --> 01:05:36.754
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

01:05:37.239 --> 01:05:41.259
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

01:05:41.419 --> 01:05:49.247
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:56.017
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

01:05:56.177 --> 01:06:01.450
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:04.728
He’s the one who worked it out.

01:06:04.888 --> 01:06:06.290
That’s why they say always,

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:10.204
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

01:06:10.364 --> 01:06:13.165
because then it gives you that peace,

01:06:13.325 --> 01:06:18.876
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

01:06:19.036 --> 01:06:22.169
that you never thought it would.

01:06:25.184 --> 01:06:29.782
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

01:06:29.942 --> 01:06:34.704
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

01:06:34.864 --> 01:06:37.868
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:40.243
We are still hoping to get the land

01:06:40.403 --> 01:06:43.650
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:46.384
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:50.665
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

01:06:50.825 --> 01:06:54.766
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

01:06:54.926 --> 01:07:00.911
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

01:07:01.778 --> 01:07:05.485
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

01:07:05.645 --> 01:07:08.845
But all that has worked out so well and now

01:07:09.005 --> 01:07:12.720
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.959
May God Bless you.
