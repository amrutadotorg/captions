1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:12,722
Today we all Sahaja Yogis are standing
on the brink of the ocean,

2
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:18,284
ocean of humanity,

3
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:28,763
where we have to face the problems
of human beings.

4
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:35,103
Otherwise, in the nature there are no
problems, they are all already solved.

5
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:40,858
So one has to understand that

6
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:51,776
it’s not just a movement of few people,
chosen people,

7
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:57,329
just to achieve Self-realisation,

8
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:02,899
but it’s a big revolution

9
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:10,388
which has to bring forth the beauties
of human beings,

10
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:19,580
the glories of human beings, the proof
of divinity,

11
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,137
of divine power and of God Almighty.

12
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:31,722
We have to now face that multitude
of people

13
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:36,108
who are absolutely ignorant compared
to you,

14
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:39,976
who have not known the knowledge of God,

15
00:01:40,177 --> 00:01:49,728
who are either lost into the darkness
of ignorance

16
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:56,745
or are burning in the fire of ego.

17
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:05,506
We have to transform this world into
a new world,

18
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:13,681
a beautiful world which you all are
enjoying,

19
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:21,657
to establish it, to be established on this
earth,

20
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:25,792
for which we have to prepare ourselves.

21
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:29,617
So far Sahaj Yoga means blessings;

22
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:35,113
if somebody is less blessed they ask Me
questions, “How is it, Mother,

23
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:38,461
we haven’t got this when we are praying
to You?

24
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:40,842
Why did it not work out?

25
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:44,768
It should have happened, after all we
are worshipping You,

26
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:50,970
so how is it that my son did not get
the job?”

27
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:57,405
So, I mean, as if it’s sort of a, some
debts have to be paid

28
00:02:57,606 --> 00:03:01,180
to all the Sahaja Yogis by Sahaj Yoga.

29
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:08,125
That sort of an attitude has been, so far,
towards Sahaj Yog.

30
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:13,512
Of, not all of you, I must say,

31
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:22,067
but in the minds there’s lurking always,
a desire to know

32
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:28,054
why, when we are Sahaj Yogis, why should
it happen to us.

33
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:32,227
You’ve seen that God has blessed you.

34
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:38,414
Some people had very miserable married
life,

35
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,765
they couldn’t understand why they had
to have a miserable married life.

36
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:48,650
Some had some misfortunes

37
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:55,416
and some had some diseases also after
coming to Sahaj Yoga.

38
00:03:55,573 --> 00:04:00,821
So there has to be understanding that
Sahaj Yoga is

39
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:08,376
for correcting your life, for putting you
on solid basis,

40
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:13,961
on proper foundations to make you
great people.

41
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:19,153
As if it gets you immuned to all these
mishappenings,

42
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:24,626
with blessings of course, so you don’t feel
the effects

43
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,556
of those misfortunes so much as you would
normally feel.

44
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:36,820
This creates beautiful human beings out
of you.

45
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:40,944
Some people have hankering after money;

46
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:45,108
some people think they can make money
by coming to Sahaj Yoga;

47
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:51,135
some people think they will become leaders
or some think they will have fame,

48
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:58,658
some think that they will achieve a kind
of a very dominant position;

49
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:03,364
and some think that they can befool Me
also.

50
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:11,957
It’s high time we realise that Sahaj Yoga
is not for this.

51
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:15,940
 Sahaj Yoga is for making you the wisest
person,

52
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:23,437
the sanest person, the most generous and
the most confident person in the world,

53
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:26,448
because you have to fight,

54
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:30,966
you have to fight the dark ignorance
of Kali Yuga,

55
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:38,600
of ages which is precipitated and today
we see all the bad effects of it.

56
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,919
Whatever you may call it, you may call it
the fanaticism,

57
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:48,537
you may call it the atheism, any isms
of any kinds,

58
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:56,296
and all these human projections which
have created

59
00:05:56,497 --> 00:06:00,535
all those artificial webs have to be
broken.

60
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:09,091
But human beings, on the whole, believe
that these artificial webs are real.

61
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:11,921
So to break that,

62
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:16,976
you have to be also be careful that you
don’t break the human beings.

63
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,338
While you are breaking their false faiths,

64
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:26,456
you have to remember that those people
who are carrying those false faiths

65
00:06:26,657 --> 00:06:32,115
are the ones who have to achieve
Self-realisation.

66
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:38,334
It’s a very delicate work, it’s a very hard
work, it’s a very harsh work

67
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:42,820
but it is the most detached work.

68
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:47,269
And when we realise that we are
so important,

69
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,792
that God has blessed us with this peace,

70
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:57,745
with this understanding, with these
powers -

71
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:01,905
it’s not only for our own gain,

72
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:08,695
because God is not only for you, He is
for the whole world.

73
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,077
So we have to utilise them, we have
to spread them,

74
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:17,577
work it out at every level; we have
to become dynamic about it.

75
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:20,130
But the most important thing is
the responsibility

76
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:24,212
of Sahaj Yoga we have to take.

77
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,089
We are Sahaj Yogis and we are responsible
for Sahaj Yoga.

78
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,158
What have we done for Sahaj Yoga?

79
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,461
We looked after our family, our children,
our jobs,

80
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:43,549
our this, our that, motorcars, our horses,
our dogs, our cats.

81
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,658
But who is responsible for Sahaj Yoga?

82
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:53,647
When it comes to that point, we are
responsible

83
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,949
of Sahaj Yoga, then it works out.

84
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:06,670
But there is a deliberate action also
of the negative forces.

85
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:12,413
And this negativity is acting through
ignorant people who believe,

86
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:15,190
who believe that they are right.

87
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,644
They don’t know what is waiting for their
destruction there.

88
00:08:19,844 --> 00:08:26,311
Specially among our young people
you’ll find

89
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:32,861
they just join any party, join any club,

90
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:37,079
join any methods, any trend, anything,

91
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:47,060
just because they have no understanding
as to what they have to be.

92
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,764
They have to be the Spirit.

93
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:56,872
I asked the other day a president of
a young organisation,

94
00:08:57,072 --> 00:09:01,013
“What is your policy?” He said,
“We have no policy.”

95
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:04,690
They started looking here and there, [and]
said, “We have no policy.”

96
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:09,407
I was amazed that they have no policy.

97
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:13,875
“No, whatever our leaders say, we do it.”

98
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:18,824
So to get people out of this kind
of slavery

99
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:24,227
that they have no brains of their own,
they can’t use their own understanding,

100
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:28,566
they have to become the Spirit.

101
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:34,555
Shivaji who was a great Atma Sakshatkari,
a realised soul,

102
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:37,173
for the future he has given the message.

103
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:46,653
He said, “Svadharma jagwawa,” means
enlighten your dharma of Spirit.

104
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:53,758
“Svadharma,” the Spirit has to be
enlightened.

105
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,685
Everybody has said that. I’m specially
quoting him

106
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:04,538
because he comes from Maharashtra; apart
from that he was a political head.

107
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:09,223
Though he was a political head but because
he was a realised soul,

108
00:10:09,423 --> 00:10:14,423
he said that your Spirit should be
awakened.

109
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:18,489
He didn’t talk of all other nonsensical
things.

110
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,604
And he knew that unless and until
the Spirit is awakened,

111
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:27,609
people will be doing all kinds of wrong
things.

112
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,084
And that is why today we find all over
the world

113
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:33,922
the mess in which all political parties,

114
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:40,944
all economic endeavours, all military
endeavours have fallen into.

115
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:50,131
So, it is for us to take over and to show
them what is an integrated life,

116
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:57,372
and what is the strength of a human being.

117
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,297
Because this Shakti is within everyone.

118
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:06,131
Just praying to Shakti, just talking about
Shakti, it doesn’t act.

119
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:15,409
But this divine Shakti has to act, and
act through you people.

120
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:19,026
Just try to realise

121
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:26,342
that within these few years how much
knowledge you have got,

122
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:32,736
how much you know, how deeply you know.

123
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,765
You are not just passing slogans
or talking, you know -

124
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:40,480
but you know it, you know
what it is.

125
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:44,168
I don’t think I have attended to each
one of you individually,

126
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:47,323
but through your Spirit only you have
come to know

127
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:51,048
all the knowledge about yourself and
knowledge about others.

128
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,275
You didn’t have to go to any library, you
didn’t have to go to any university.

129
00:11:56,476 --> 00:11:58,560
All the saints never went,

130
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:02,783
none of the saints went to any university
or read any books,

131
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:07,364
but how knowledgeable they were, because
they were the Spirit.

132
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:11,716
So the first and foremost responsibility
of a Sahaj Yogi

133
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:17,165
on this day is to be the Spirit, on the day
when we are celebrating

134
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:22,473
the birthday of Christ, who was the Spirit.

135
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,635
So, this is our greatest responsibility
first to see that,

136
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:35,517
“Are we the Spirit, or we are this body,
this mind, this ego? What are we?”

137
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,927
If you have achieved that state,

138
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:45,795
if you have achieved that state,

139
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:49,511
then you are, as they call in Marathi,
samarthya,

140
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:59,757
means, you are equal to your name;
that you are the Spirit.

141
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:04,138
If you cannot achieve that,

142
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,045
then you are a half-baked Sahaj Yogi,
not yet done.

143
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:13,111
As you know, we have no organisations,
no memberships, nothing.

144
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:21,917
But we have one thing, that we know
we are realised souls,

145
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:29,540
that we know more than all others know,
and that we are not proud of it.

146
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:33,273
We are very humble people.

147
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:40,309
But this humility should not become
a stagnation or a lethargy within us that,

148
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,943
“Now we are realised souls, let us sit
on a tree and have our blessings.”

149
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,656
You have to get to the roots

150
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:57,802
and you all have to work it out
on your level.

151
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,507
But first get rid of your own personal
problems,

152
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,763
all petty things that you have.

153
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,713
When we talk of sacrifice, as you know,

154
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:15,552
in Sahaj Yoga I have not known what
sacrifice people have done.

155
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:19,947
You have to sacrifice your ego,

156
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:24,582
which is a headache to you and to Me.

157
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,289
And you have to sacrifice your
conditioning,

158
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,546
only two things, left and right.

159
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,478
And that can be achieved and many
have achieved [it],

160
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,954
but now put that detached personality
to a test.

161
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:50,645
And then, once you are sure that you
are detached,

162
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,773
then employ your energy in doing

163
00:14:55,974 --> 00:15:05,837
constructive improvement of this whole
world.

164
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:11,293
It will work out for poverty, it will
work out for politics,

165
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:20,461
it will work out for economics, it will
work out for every field of life.

166
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:27,268
Sahaj Yoga is the only solution because
in this human beings are transformed.

167
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:34,638
It’s not like this, that one person changes
the address

168
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,865
or the badge that he is wearing, and he
becomes something else.

169
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:46,560
Or from church to temple and temple
to church.

170
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,631
It’s something within that transforms you,
makes you knowledgeable.

171
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:58,636
So you are already Sat Chit Ananda; because
you know the truth,

172
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:06,837
you are in joy and your attention
is enlightened.

173
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:15,456
With all this that you have, what are we
to do now?

174
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:21,398
If you enlighten the light, it
automatically knows

175
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:25,669
that it has to give the light.

176
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:33,159
In the same way, all the Sahaj Yogis
have to take the responsibility

177
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,784
for this great war we have started.

178
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:50,041
It’s not the war with swords or with
atomic energies,

179
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:54,701
because they are all destructive.

180
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:59,510
This is the war against all the destructive
powers

181
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:03,792
through the power of love which is
constructive,

182
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:08,343
which constructs human beings, which
constructs societies,

183
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:14,723
which constructs countries and the whole
world.

184
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:22,907
That is your own

185
00:17:24,486 --> 00:17:29,643
and also this decision has to be your own.

186
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:34,086
Even if I give big lectures and say things,

187
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:38,394
it may not have any effect whatsoever
on you.

188
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,228
It might be just wasted,

189
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:47,951
if you haven’t got the capacity to imbibe
what I am saying,

190
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:55,470
so important, so imminent.

191
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:58,016
Now give up all the worries you have about

192
00:17:58,217 --> 00:18:01,365
your small, small, little, little things
of your family,

193
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:04,739
of your work, your factories,

194
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,141
of your business, of your official
positions

195
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:18,755
and just know that everything has to go
through Sahaj Yoga.

196
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:26,673
Even the cooking I do, I do it through
Sahaj.

197
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:32,146
If the fire is not working, just put your
hands to the fire, it becomes all right.

198
00:18:32,347 --> 00:18:38,255
If the rice is not cooking, put your hands
to the rice, it cooks.

199
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:43,110
Anything going wrong anywhere, you can
use your vibrations.

200
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:51,050
But I don’t know what to use to make you
feel responsible for Sahaj Yoga,

201
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:55,338
that now we’ve got such a great thing
with us

202
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,414
and what are we going to do about it.

203
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:03,164
[Shri Mataji continues talk in Marathi
for eleven minutes.]

204
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:05,409
I’m getting vibrations from you,

205
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,267
that means you all have agreed to what
I’m saying.

206
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:10,371
May God bless you all.
