Puja Talk, India Tour. Ganapatipule (India), 6 January 1988.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:28.255
It is said that God is Satchitanand.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:35.440
He is truth, He is attention and He is joy.

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:52.120
In Sahaja Yoga, first you have discovered the truth.

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:59.869
You discovered the truth on your fingertips.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.972
The truth that you can discover

00:02:03.172 --> 00:02:07.865
on your central nervous system is the truth.

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:13.143
First you discover the truth and you can tell about it,

00:02:13.343 --> 00:02:17.949
talk about, explain about it

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.283
but you cannot give it to others

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:26.658
unless and until the other person gets Realization.

00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:32.372
So the truth has to be tested.

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:43.657
One has to test on the fingertips the existence of truth.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.700
Otherwise all kinds of descriptions are of no avail.

00:02:56.906 --> 00:03:00.574
No one can understand what you are talking about

00:03:00.774 --> 00:03:04.725
when you tell them that you can feel the all pervading power

00:03:04.925 --> 00:03:08.821
of Gods' love around you.

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:23.481
And then you start experiencing your attention.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:39.061
You start feeling that

00:03:39.261 --> 00:03:45.021
there is somebody, some force, some power,

00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.940
some organization is looking after you.

00:03:54.417 --> 00:04:02.414
Gradually you find your own attention becomes active.

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:08.547
Today I am happy to say that

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:13.101
I can tell you all these things openly, so clearly.

00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:20.178
But can you believe that 20 years back even in India

00:04:20.378 --> 00:04:25.836
nobody could talk about it

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.585
because something Agamya, not to be known,

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:32.537
not to be understood.

00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:37.761
Because your attention has become enlightened,

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:43.134
with your enlightened attention you are listening to Me

00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:48.174
that's why you are understand what I am saying.

00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:53.124
You attention itself has become active now.

00:04:55.093 --> 00:04:58.093
And it baffles you sometimes when you see

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.380
how many powers you have got.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.459
So through your Kundalini awakening

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:16.346
your attention has got a subtler dimension

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:21.331
which gives you an active attention.

00:05:22.966 --> 00:05:29.450
Before this you use to play into the hands of your attention.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.490
Anything happen you would turn your head to that,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.609
anything that would be called as some sort of an event

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.305
or something attractive you

00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:48.487
you would be putting your attention to that.

00:05:48.687 --> 00:05:56.541
Your attention would go to things which were controlling you as if,

00:05:56.741 --> 00:06:00.311
as if they were in charge of you.

00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:04.212
But after getting Realization

00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:10.285
your attention itself is under your own power and it
acts.

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:19.400
First in India we had a foreign rule

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.981
so we had to act according to

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:26.009
the wish of the foreign rulers.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.423
So we thought it is better to have independence,

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:36.768
to have our own rulers.

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:42.893
So we achieved the freedom politically

00:06:43.093 --> 00:06:48.338
we have our own rulers who will rule us

00:06:48.538 --> 00:06:51.417
according to our own wish

00:06:51.617 --> 00:06:57.064
and we won't be enslaved by others' wishes.

00:06:59.176 --> 00:07:02.984
But this is not freedom at all

00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:07.856
because your attention is still in bondage.

00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:13.132
It has got the shackles

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:17.780
of all kinds of nonsensical things upon it.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.337
It shifts all the time to wrong things.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:34.139
But after Realization attention becomes Nirmal, free,

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.953
Samarthiya, powerful

00:07:39.153 --> 00:07:44.477
it acts because it is completely free now.

00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:47.354
Unless and until you are completely free

00:07:47.555 --> 00:07:51.995
you cannot act.

00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:55.625
This is the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:55.825 --> 00:07:59.943
that your attention has become so free.

00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:08.633
It acts the way you wanted to act and it communicates.

00:08:11.045 --> 00:08:14.768
It communicates to you.

00:08:15.656 --> 00:08:21.242
The real communication starts. One
day a gentleman who are given,

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:24.196
whom I have given Realization for the first time,

00:08:24.396 --> 00:08:28.266
he got Realization, he was the first one to get it.

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:32.155
And he went into his congregation

00:08:32.355 --> 00:08:35.917
where he felt that there is somebody else who is a Realized soul.

00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:39.778
So he looked around and he saw a lady sitting there

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:44.248
who had Realization. He came and asked Me, Mother

00:08:44.464 --> 00:08:49.205
did you give Realization to such and such lady. I said I did.

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:55.711
So this communication between the reality and yourself

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:58.410
is established through attention

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:04.292
because in the attention now there is freedom to know.

00:09:05.207 --> 00:09:07.261
But in the attention now

00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:11.094
we have to see that there are so many other things

00:09:11.294 --> 00:09:19.045
which have clouded the awareness of the attention.

00:09:20.085 --> 00:09:27.877
This cloudedness comes with our conditioning and our ego.

00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:32.510
And this conditioning can be very, very strong.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.598
I would say in India, we are over conditioned people

00:09:36.798 --> 00:09:39.766
because we are traditionally made.

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:42.725
And we do not see what is good in tradition

00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:46.254
and what is bad in tradition. Whatever good we have to keep

00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:48.468
and whatever bad we have to throw away.

00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:57.823
Whatever is the tradition is the
best is absolutely a wrong idea.

00:10:00.054 --> 00:10:04.087
So such an attention which is so much bogged

00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:09.366
or you can say completely covered with conditioning

00:10:09.566 --> 00:10:14.360
can not communicate with reality.

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:26.030
Though reality is anxious to communicate and to say

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:34.520
or to inform whatever is desires of the Divine

00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:40.778
but, as we are so much loaded with our conditioning

00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:45.375
that it can not communicate.

00:10:45.994 --> 00:10:48.114
You are frightened of the society,

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.399
you are frightened of the surroundings,

00:10:50.599 --> 00:10:53.028
frightened of our relations, who are no more our relations

00:10:53.228 --> 00:10:55.326
at all, nothing to do with because they have

00:10:55.526 --> 00:10:58.611
no communication with the reality.

00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:02.065
We are the ones who have got now

00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:06.356
communication with reality.

00:11:06.557 --> 00:11:09.311
When the ego part, our futuristic ideas w

00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:11.894
e want to develop this, we want to do that

00:11:11.894 --> 00:11:15.636
we want to achieve this.

00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:22.665
That also dulls our attention

00:11:22.865 --> 00:11:29.764
and puts it into the shackles of ego
which are even worse I would say.

00:11:29.964 --> 00:11:33.456
At least the first one...

00:11:35.202 --> 00:11:40.527
Some children have beautiful attention and some don't have.

00:11:40.727 --> 00:11:43.575
I would not always blame the parents but of course partly

00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:45.775
they are responsible.

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:47.976
At this stage if their attention is not good,

00:11:48.177 --> 00:11:51.320
at what age they are going to improve? Parents pamper them,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.163
spoil them then the children cant' have good attention.

00:11:59.034 --> 00:12:03.103
Those who are half hearted Sahaja Yogis

00:12:03.303 --> 00:12:08.630
are still sitting on the edges.

00:12:10.043 --> 00:12:15.789
And can be anytime brought into the sea of illusion.

00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:21.338
You have to be perfect Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.638
Some people find it easy, escape it by saying that

00:12:26.837 --> 00:12:30.527
such and such person is much better than me.

00:12:30.728 --> 00:12:33.822
And then too sat back and saying that "oh, I am not good".

00:12:34.022 --> 00:12:37.609
So you better get out.

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:48.159
Here the Divine needs the people who will do the job of the Divine.

00:12:50.523 --> 00:12:52.729
But even if you ask them to get out

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.801
they'll stick on and stick on and stick on.

00:12:57.002 --> 00:13:00.865
It's not going to help them because they think it is blissful,

00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:05.955
may be some of them think that they
can have some material advantage.

00:13:06.155 --> 00:13:11.107
Some of them think they can get some presents in Ganapatipulle.

00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:16.999
Very low grade understanding.

00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:25.802
So such people are bothering us and are good for nothing.

00:13:26.002 --> 00:13:31.582
The first and foremost thing is to clear your heart.

00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:37.202
I have seen that the relationships

00:13:37.402 --> 00:13:43.291
is the greatest curse on Indians.

00:13:44.248 --> 00:13:51.446
And the second is the caste system.

00:13:52.788 --> 00:13:59.927
I know of a lady who is absolutely no good for Sahaja Yog

00:14:00.127 --> 00:14:04.010
but her sisters are supporting her.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.599
I know all that and as a result

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.183
they are losing themselves in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:09.384 --> 00:14:13.694
and the brother in law has become suddenly hot tempered.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.108
But if I tell them they won't listen

00:14:16.308 --> 00:14:18.681
till they are completely finished, all of them

00:14:18.681 --> 00:14:22.467
this lady will stick on.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.640
Unless and until this lady clears her heart

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.590
she should not come to Sahaja Yoga and oblige all the relations.

00:14:34.526 --> 00:14:38.398
This kind of low graded understanding of Sahaja Yoga

00:14:38.598 --> 00:14:46.542
will lead you no where and how many of
you are going to drop out I don't know.

00:14:51.376 --> 00:14:53.505
You wouldn't even know when you are catching

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:58.578
and what's happening if you keep to these relationships.

00:14:59.753 --> 00:15:03.517
Another, is another myth of a caste system in this country,

00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:06.533
which is the greatest cancer, you could think of,

00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:10.852
for such a Divine country like this.

00:15:12.043 --> 00:15:16.605
It's the greatest curse

00:15:16.805 --> 00:15:20.153
but in the West we have another curses

00:15:20.353 --> 00:15:24.202
though you have got rid of all these past thing

00:15:24.402 --> 00:15:27.805
you have modern curses.

00:15:28.005 --> 00:15:31.337
And the modern curses are even worse in a way

00:15:31.537 --> 00:15:34.315
because they are not troublesome at all.

00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:39.162
On the contrary they show as if

00:15:39.362 --> 00:15:44.621
you are on top of the world that you are very successful.

00:15:48.304 --> 00:15:54.856
In the modern curses the thing is the attitude "what's wrong?".

00:15:57.912 --> 00:16:04.650
They linger on this idea to great extent,

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.753
"what's wrong?".

00:16:07.953 --> 00:16:11.962
You have to be selfish about it.

00:16:12.162 --> 00:16:16.248
You have to think about yourself

00:16:16.448 --> 00:16:20.399
and not about others and about your society,

00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:29.968
about your development, you're so-called industrial revolution.

00:16:30.627 --> 00:16:32.608
It has already cursed you.

00:16:32.808 --> 00:16:34.895
Industrial revolution has already cursed you.

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:38.464
You are eating the food from tins.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:43.220
You are having hybrid animals to give you milk,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.769
tomorrow you will have mothers who are hybrid.

00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:54.678
You are having divorces, you are having drugs,

00:16:54.878 --> 00:16:58.607
all kinds of things that are curse on human beings

00:16:58.807 --> 00:17:03.910
are worked out through this modern conditioning in you.

00:17:07.498 --> 00:17:10.242
To make this attention clean

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:15.160
should be the only effort of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:17:15.361 --> 00:17:17.413
Sahaja Yogi is not a pass time,

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:19.778
for many it's is just a pass time.

00:17:19.979 --> 00:17:22.494
Their jobs, their businesses is most important.

00:17:22.694 --> 00:17:25.827
Sahaja Yoga is just a pass time.

00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:29.865
They are all right for a time being. How long will they go on?

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:32.770
I can't say.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:38.710
So clear your attention first then everything is going to work out.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.901
But see that in your attention you pay importance to things,

00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:45.953
which are no important at all.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:53.481
In this respect I would say you have to be individual,

00:17:53.683 --> 00:17:56.209
to know that your attention has to be clean.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:18:00.341
Where is my attention going?

00:18:01.865 --> 00:18:08.286
Clubbing is the worst curse that
we have in Western Countries.

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:11.407
They will club under any name. Supposing

00:18:11.407 --> 00:18:16.486
there is a red hair people, they will form a red hair league.

00:18:22.723 --> 00:18:25.604
In that way I would say

00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:28.631
people are least individualistic.

00:18:28.832 --> 00:18:31.209
Whatever they may say that they are democratic

00:18:31.409 --> 00:18:34.368
I would say they are least individualistic.

00:18:34.568 --> 00:18:40.618
If a lady starts a kind of a hairstyle

00:18:40.818 --> 00:18:45.849
all the ladies do the same, just like donkeys.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.315
If the men do not put oil in their hair

00:18:49.516 --> 00:18:52.370
all the men will not put oil in theirs'.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.054
I don't know what looks nice without the... dishevelled hair

00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:57.894
I just don't understand. That's the fashion now,

00:18:58.094 --> 00:19:01.881
nobody will put any oil in their hair.

00:19:02.082 --> 00:19:06.157
Even if you can wash it off they will not put it.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:13.619
This is such a simple thing

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:18.517
that you need oil for your hair.

00:19:20.597 --> 00:19:28.332
But all these modern ideas are anti life.

00:19:35.599 --> 00:19:40.193
They are teaching you something which will make you bald.

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:45.292
Sometimes you lose your ears or nose or whatever it is.

00:19:46.292 --> 00:19:48.949
To put that in the ears all the time and

00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:52.804
listen to that music all the time and going on the streets,

00:19:53.004 --> 00:19:58.923
on those wheels, I mean it's really madness I think,

00:19:59.123 --> 00:20:02.695
stupidity, absolutely.

00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:07.181
But regarded as something very modern.

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:11.180
It's all anti life activities going on.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:18.076
Putting color on the hair, red, yellow, green,

00:20:18.457 --> 00:20:21.741
wearing no clothes when it's so very cold,

00:20:21.941 --> 00:20:28.097
sitting in the sun burning your skin,

00:20:30.152 --> 00:20:37.160
to behave indecently, decorously, that is to be modern.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.390
"What's wrong?"

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:46.688
Nothing is wrong, just to go to hell, that's all.

00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:52.354
If that means nothing, take two running jumps and go there

00:20:52.554 --> 00:20:56.856
but leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:59.276 --> 00:21:02.788
Now the attention has to be cleared in a way that we meditate

00:21:02.788 --> 00:21:05.790
within ourselves and just go within yourself,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.403
but see yourself what you are,

00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:15.603
how beautiful you are, how glorious you are, how subtle you are.

00:21:18.658 --> 00:21:21.964
But in stupid things they are individualistic,

00:21:22.164 --> 00:21:26.162
like "this is my carpet and this is my house,

00:21:26.362 --> 00:21:30.179
this is my furniture."

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.400
And they control others with that "this is my furniture,

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.735
don't sit on that chair. Don't spoil my carpet".

00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:47.098
When you will die you won't be
buried with the carpet even.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.113
Like in Egypt Pharaohs were buried with all their things you see.

00:21:56.313 --> 00:21:59.256
It is not possible these days because you don't have so much place

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:02.988
to bury.

00:22:03.884 --> 00:22:05.930
So sticking on to nonsensical things

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:11.176
and the important things not paying attention

00:22:11.376 --> 00:22:14.636
is an absolutely abuse of your attention

00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:17.493
and this has been achieved

00:22:17.693 --> 00:22:23.411
through your so called modern idea of individualism.

00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:32.609
There is no integration of understanding

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:40.682
and the whole thing is breaking into pieces.

00:22:43.152 --> 00:22:49.761
Between these two horrible extremes

00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:56.118
I have dared to start Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:56.318 --> 00:23:00.699
to collect you all there in the center.

00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:05.421
How?

00:23:06.478 --> 00:23:10.756
With very intense love.

00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:18.936
With very intense effort

00:23:19.136 --> 00:23:25.541
and a complete commitment that I am going to save this world.

00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:37.360
It has worked so well now,

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:46.639
I can see you all get into the third stage of joy.

00:23:48.989 --> 00:23:54.408
And the joy is what I want you to have

00:23:54.608 --> 00:24:01.334
and not self-destruction or stupid conditioning pressures.

00:24:01.534 --> 00:24:04.270
Joy

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:10.726
and joy has no double meaning it's absolute.

00:24:12.949 --> 00:24:16.256
You reach to that subtlety that you start enjoying

00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:22.248
the tasting of joy, not vibration but joy,

00:24:24.478 --> 00:24:27.675
beyond your central nervous system

00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:32.360
where it can not be expressed in words.

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:38.817
It expresses in your eyes, in your faces, in the atmosphere,

00:24:39.017 --> 00:24:42.794
in the nature, everywhere

00:24:42.994 --> 00:24:47.708
to see the whole thing is blossoming around.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.725
This is what you all have to achieve

00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:57.923
and for that we have to know

00:24:58.123 --> 00:25:03.937
that we are not going to bow down to anything

00:25:04.137 --> 00:25:09.153
that puts our attention into shackles.

00:25:09.624 --> 00:25:15.027
"Mother has freed us, let us spread our wings."

00:25:15.227 --> 00:25:18.534
"We are not little, small little birdies

00:25:18.734 --> 00:25:21.900
but now we have become birds

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:31.229
and let us spread our wings and fly in the sky of joy".

00:25:36.888 --> 00:25:41.085
There is no need for birds to fly.

00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:44.464
They can sit at a place,

00:25:44.664 --> 00:25:48.377
of course, they cannot hire a bus,

00:25:48.577 --> 00:25:52.347
but they need not.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:02.060
They spread their wings and fly because they enjoy it,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:09.998
like swimming in the sky of joy.

00:26:12.545 --> 00:26:18.933
So use the beauty of this joyous happening

00:26:19.133 --> 00:26:21.386
to nourish yourself,

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:24.092
be happy,

00:26:24.292 --> 00:26:31.293
make everyone happy and emancipate this world from ignorance.

00:26:31.494 --> 00:26:34.833
May God bless you all.
