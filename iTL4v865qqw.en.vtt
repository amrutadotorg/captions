00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.250
I am overjoyed really today

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.291
to see you all here

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.750
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:19.542
We were to be in Portugal

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.709
but it was not so - so we are here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.166
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:34.792
but extremely significant.

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:39.458
Firstly in Diwali,

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:44.875
the first day they buy something

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.375
for the family.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.542
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.417
an ornament for the wife

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.375
or something like that.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:07.667
Because that is the day of housewife.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.750
And that day is to be celebrated

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:19.667
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.625
As a result you know in India even now

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.542
housewives are very much respected.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.709
Actually they are respected all over.

00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:39.041
You will be amazed that even

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.291
in the protocol of the government

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.542
receptions anywhere

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.750
the wife is very important.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.959
And where she is sitting,

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:57.500
what is her position is very important.

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:58.917
Even today

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:04.291
in the most modern and advanced countries also

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.375
they have a special respect for the housewife.

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:10.750
The housewife may not be educated,

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.125
she may be a very simple woman,

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.041
she may not be very modern.

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:24.792
There was an experience for Me:

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.291
in London we had a program

00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.166
where we all were invited,

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:40.250
and the head of the delegation,

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.834
his wife was missing.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.999
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.166
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.000
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:54.333
She must be somewhere here.”

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.291
So just before starting

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:05.542
I went to the washing room

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:07.542
and I was surprised

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.542
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.667
I said, “What are you doing here?

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:15.625
They are all waiting for you outside.”

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:19.875
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:21.792
So I went out and I told them

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.625
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:27.000
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.291
“Is she the wife?”

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.458
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.375
“We thought she was some secretary.”

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:37.291
I said, “What made you think?”

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.500
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.667
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.166
and everybody thought

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:50.166
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.417
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:58.291
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.500
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.999
and not to dress up like a secretary

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:11.625
or somebody who is just in the office.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.834
Because she is regarded as the highest -

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.375
whether you like it or not.

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:20.417
But she had permed her hair

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:23.250
and she has been to a very expensive place

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.792
for all decorations and everything.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.041
And poor thing, when she arrived

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.875
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.291
That’s what it is.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.250
So for a housewife,

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:44.125
she is the dignity of the household.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.375
Not only that, but she is responsible

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:53.250
for the complete culture of that country,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.667
complete culture of that country.

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:00.625
They represent the culture.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:04.750
Like in India nowadays they have started

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:08.166
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.458
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:13.375
I haven’t seen anybody.

00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:16.333
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:19.999
because the society is so strong

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:24.999
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:26.417
She has to be decent,

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:30.750
she has to be very dignified

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.709
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:37.750
On the contrary I would say,

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:41.625
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:44.792
His wife was absolutely uneducated

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.166
because Shastriji went to jail

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.542
and she couldn’t take her education -

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.208
very simple, ordinary woman.

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:55.959
And she went to France.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:59.458
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.667
he was the president.

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:05.250
And his wife was another very simple woman.

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:07.166
So Shastriji told her

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.709
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:12.375
now you’ve become great friends.”

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:14.291
God knows she didn’t know French

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.125
and she didn’t know Hindi,

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:19.458
but somehow both of them became great friends,

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:22.458
on the level of housewives.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:28.208
And when he warned her not to cry,

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:32.375
what happened that they started crying

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:34.125
when they had to leave.

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:36.750
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:40.041
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.667
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.999
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:51.000
collectivity of housewives

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:53.250
that has to work out.

00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:56.041
They have common problems,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.208
they have to face their children,

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:01.999
they have to look after the household,

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:05.792
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:07.999
with the housewives.

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.667
And the housewife also

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.333
knows all little, little things.

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:17.000
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:20.999
because they live in the air, I think.

00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:24.000
So the women have more sense

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:27.000
in this respect, for small, small things

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:29.250
they are quite aware.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.875
It’s very interesting sometimes,

00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:37.375
the men commit mistakes

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:41.291
of such a great humor.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.000
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:51.709
with all the problems of daily life.

00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:53.792
On one side the woman,

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:57.667
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:02.083
On the other side she has to look after her family,

00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:03.959
her children.

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:07.709
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:09.917
for the society.

00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:12.959
She has to maintain the society.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.583
In a country where women are sensible

00:08:16.792 --> 00:08:19.125
and are matured,

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.583
you will be amazed that they become

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:25.000
extremely good families,

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.542
good societies and good children.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.375
That’s why I must say,

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:34.583
India is a very good country of very good society.

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:38.500
This is come out of the housewives,

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.208
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

00:08:41.417 --> 00:08:45.792
who have done all the work that is important

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:48.709
as far as the culture is concerned.

00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:53.750
This kind of thing is very much in India

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:57.583
and with that, what you find

00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:01.959
that the people respect,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.125
respect the housewives.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:07.333
So respecting the housewife

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:12.834
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:16.166
But that doesn’t mean that

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:21.125
the women should try to dominate and trouble

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.125
and fight with the husbands.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:30.125
But it means a very important position

00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:33.875
in the society, of a housewife.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:40.625
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

00:09:40.834 --> 00:09:43.667
But she too has to be a devi.

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.999
If you treat her like a doormat,

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:49.999
then children will never respect her.

00:09:50.166 --> 00:09:53.750
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:57.208
the children won’t respect the mother

00:09:57.417 --> 00:09:59.500
and there will be no impact

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:02.208
of the mother on the children.

00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:05.750
As a result the children get wayward,

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:09.500
and in the societies or in the countries

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:12.750
where the mother is not respected,

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:18.041
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.291
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:27.000
So it’s very important that on this day

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:30.083
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:33.917
you have to buy something for your wife,

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:37.333
and you have to give her something as a present.

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:42.041
At least you should buy a little pot

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.417
or something that can be used in the kitchen

00:10:46.625 --> 00:10:49.166
to show your respect to her.

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:52.625
In the families where mother is not respected

00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:56.208
children become extremely troublesome

00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:59.709
and the whole, their family also suffers -

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:03.166
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:06.333
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:11.375
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:14.333
In the presence of the children if they shout,

00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:19.000
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:23.041
the children can never respect the mother.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.542
It is something, a criminal thing to do

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.583
to women who are in the household

00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:32.709
doing all the work for you,

00:11:32.917 --> 00:11:35.625
looking after you, your family,

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:37.999
not demanding anything.

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:41.250
Only if you want to understand

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.125
how they can be troublesome,

00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:45.542
is see them in the politics.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.083
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.542
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

00:11:55.834 --> 00:12:00.625
Because their field is their house, their family.

00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:03.166
If they are not respected in the family,

00:12:03.375 --> 00:12:05.333
they get out of the family

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:09.375
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

00:12:09.583 --> 00:12:11.875
Though she has to bear a lot,

00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:13.542
she has to suffer a lot,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.250
but in the family she must be respected.

00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:24.417
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:30.417
Then the second day is the one where

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:36.291
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

00:12:36.834 --> 00:12:43.000
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:49.291
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.333
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:56.125
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

00:12:56.333 --> 00:13:00.208
and it was impossible to kill him.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.166
But then somehow or other,

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:07.125
with the advent of a special power

00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:10.166
that this Narakasura was killed.

00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:14.875
That was the another day, fourth day,

00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:17.667
where Narakasura was killed.

00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:21.333
They say that when he was killed,

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:25.208
the door of hell was closed.

00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:29.166
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.625
But I am of the opinion

00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:35.291
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.500
Be in your beds

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:43.083
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:46.041
You should not bother about him.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.041
“Naraka” means hell.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.625
And from the hell

00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:55.041
they extracted him and killed him.

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.583
The last one is the best,

00:13:57.792 --> 00:14:01.792
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:04.875
and His brother Bharat.

00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:09.542
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.417
And for fourteen years

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:15.291
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.542
He went in the forest

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.291
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.166
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:28.959
forest by His father

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.750
and his daughter-in-law;

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:34.542
also I mean it’s His own wife.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.709
And also the brother, they went together

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:42.041
into great sufferings.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.291
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.291
The child

00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:54.041
that lived in the palaces

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.250
had to go in the forest

00:14:56.458 --> 00:15:00.041
and live in terrible conditions,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.083
when He was to be the king.

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:05.208
Was too much.

00:15:05.834 --> 00:15:09.208
But Sita went with Him

00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:12.000
and She supported Him

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:16.834
and ultimately it so happened that

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:25.750
Ravana came and took away Sita.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.125
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:31.792
killed him and brought back His wife.

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:33.875
But when they came back

00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:38.500
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:40.625
there was a big jubilation

00:15:40.834 --> 00:15:43.083
and Bharat, His brother -

00:15:43.291 --> 00:15:46.500
he was very much attached to his brother

00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:49.750
and he ruled that country

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:52.166
with the paduka -

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:58.542
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.333
they use – of his brother.

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:05.041
He put it on the throne and ruled.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.917
So that is how the Bharat milan-

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:10.542
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:11.875
is celebrated,

00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:14.875
and that was the time He was crowned also

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:16.375
as the king.

00:16:16.583 --> 00:16:18.000
So it is long time back,

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:19.583
thousands of years back

00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:21.166
this thing has happened.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:25.291
That jubilation is very significant

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500
that the right king gets His own throne,

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:31.667
and He rules.

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:33.208
And all the injustice

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:37.875
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

00:16:38.041 --> 00:16:42.250
has to be completely finished from His life.

00:16:42.458 --> 00:16:46.166
And that’s why Diwali is important.

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:51.999
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:54.208
Because it is Her blessings

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:58.458
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:02.959
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:07.750
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:11.208
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

00:17:12.083 --> 00:17:15.875
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:18.333
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.375
It doesn’t mean money,

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:21.667
not at all.

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:23.917
To worship money is wrong.

00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:26.041
But what it means that

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.542
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.083
or the whatever prosperity with that -

00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.667
should be very carefully spent,

00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:39.709
because She is very mobile

00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:41.834
and the money can slip out.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.999
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:50.291
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.166
But if you want to spend,

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.542
you must spend it in the right way,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.999
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:08.542
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.542
you must be knowing

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.875
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:16.750
She had four hands,

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:20.208
one hand was to give.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.250
She is generous, She gives.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.792
Like this She gives,

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:29.875
and with one hand She blesses.

00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:31.750
These are Her two hands.

00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:35.417
One is to give, and to bless the person.

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.417
Very important it is,

00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:43.999
that when you give to somebody something,

00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.041
you forget about it,

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.667
and you bless that person.

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:50.375
Not only you give money,

00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:53.750
but also you bless that person.

00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:57.041
The other two hands

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:02.250
have got two lotuses of pink color.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.375
Pink is the color of love.

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:09.750
And a person who has money

00:19:09.959 --> 00:19:12.750
should have a house

00:19:12.959 --> 00:19:16.083
which is full of love.

00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.625
Any guest who comes in the house

00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:20.959
should be respected.

00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:25.959
He should be treated just like God.

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:28.583
In India you have noticed how

00:19:28.792 --> 00:19:29.959
they think foreigners -

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:32.041
“foreigners” means God to them.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.041
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.458
but in India is very respectable.

00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:37.917
If you are a foreigner

00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:40.208
means that you are God.

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:43.792
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:45.333
This is the reason,

00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:48.750
this is the basic culture of India

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:51.291
that anybody who is a guest -

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.583
he may be anything -

00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:53.917
if he is a guest

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:57.166
then he is to be treated like God.

00:19:57.458 --> 00:20:01.208
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

00:20:01.417 --> 00:20:03.625
If you are a foreigner

00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:08.166
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

00:20:08.709 --> 00:20:12.500
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

00:20:27.709 --> 00:20:29.542
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.750
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

00:20:31.959 --> 00:20:38.166
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:40.125
They look after each other

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:43.583
and they are beautifully collective.

00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:49.667
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:52.458
is a house full of love.

00:20:52.667 --> 00:20:56.999
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

00:20:57.166 --> 00:21:01.291
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.125
and the beetle goes inside

00:21:03.333 --> 00:21:07.333
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

00:21:07.917 --> 00:21:10.999
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:14.999
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

00:21:15.166 --> 00:21:17.542
But here what I find

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.999
in the world now, if you have money

00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:22.999
you become yourself like a beetle.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:26.750
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:30.750
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.000
It’s just surprising is

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:35.542
that money which should give them

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.500
the form of Lakshmi

00:21:39.709 --> 00:21:41.041
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.250
they become like devils.

00:21:43.458 --> 00:21:48.250
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:53.750
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

00:21:53.959 --> 00:21:57.291
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.333
That means no pressure on anyone.

00:22:00.542 --> 00:22:03.291
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.625
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

00:22:07.834 --> 00:22:10.083
just on Her own She stands

00:22:10.291 --> 00:22:16.750
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:20.542
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.792
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:27.542
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.917
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:36.250
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:40.333
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:42.792
and also funny ideas

00:22:42.999 --> 00:22:48.208
of having a, something, very expensive things

00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:53.333
and what you call the designers.

00:22:53.542 --> 00:22:57.500
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:59.208
that they have come.

00:22:59.417 --> 00:23:03.041
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.166
and all your money goes to waste.

00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:12.125
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

00:23:12.333 --> 00:23:14.083
such wasteful habits.

00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:17.458
They don’t do anything which we can call as

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:20.375
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:23.583
So one has to remember

00:23:23.792 --> 00:23:27.333
that when you want to give something to someone

00:23:27.542 --> 00:23:30.333
do it with the full heart.

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.542
Such full heart that

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.250
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:38.750
You see, that should happen, otherwise

00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:42.542
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.500
You see, they are very funny people, you know

00:23:45.709 --> 00:23:51.125
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

00:23:52.542 --> 00:23:56.208
But they try to give presents.

00:23:56.417 --> 00:23:58.250
Like in Japan, if you go,

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:00.542
they’ll give you such a big present.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.750
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:09.333
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

00:24:09.542 --> 00:24:12.041
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.166
you will take two,

00:24:17.917 --> 00:24:21.625
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:24.375
small little those matchsticks.

00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:25.750
Start looking at them

00:24:25.959 --> 00:24:30.709
“What this is, why such a big design?”

00:24:30.917 --> 00:24:33.709
and very surprising.

00:24:33.999 --> 00:24:37.458
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:40.875
When we went there, they told us

00:24:41.542 --> 00:24:46.208
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

00:24:46.458 --> 00:24:47.917
they would give us a present.

00:24:48.083 --> 00:24:49.417
Now I said, “What is this?

00:24:49.625 --> 00:24:52.333
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

00:24:52.542 --> 00:24:55.417
So the lady who was translating, she said

00:24:55.625 --> 00:24:57.999
“They think You are from a royal family.”

00:24:58.166 --> 00:25:01.667
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:04.750
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

00:25:04.959 --> 00:25:06.000
I said, “Really?”

00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:11.875
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:16.166
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

00:25:16.417 --> 00:25:19.792
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:24.917
Just imagine what ideas people have about

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.667
hairdressing and all that.

00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.999
But in India or these places

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:38.500
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

00:25:38.709 --> 00:25:41.542
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.500
Because we have many people who

00:25:45.709 --> 00:25:48.166
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

00:25:48.375 --> 00:25:52.041
and they wear their hairdress like that.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.750
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

00:25:56.959 --> 00:26:00.792
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:03.250
also the children pick up much more

00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:06.208
then from the mother than from the father.

00:26:06.417 --> 00:26:09.250
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

00:26:09.458 --> 00:26:12.917
But actually the, all the refined things

00:26:13.083 --> 00:26:15.375
are picked up from the mother.

00:26:15.583 --> 00:26:18.834
So it is more for the ladies

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.959
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:25.625
Nowadays – I went to London

00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:28.000
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:29.999
“What is the fashion now?”

00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:32.625
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

00:26:32.834 --> 00:26:35.834
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.250
See in India, if we have hair like this

00:26:38.458 --> 00:26:41.375
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:46.500
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

00:26:46.999 --> 00:26:49.917
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:52.750
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:54.875
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:58.458
And this now is quite common I find everybody

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:00.792
dignified ladies also,

00:27:00.999 --> 00:27:02.709
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

00:27:02.917 --> 00:27:05.417
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:09.083
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:12.125
But anybody who does anything

00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:14.458
that should not be followed by women.

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:15.999
It’s very slavish.

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:18.667
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:20.959
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:23.709
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:27.166
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:29.500
Because you are independent.

00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:31.709
You must stand on your own character.

00:27:31.917 --> 00:27:34.709
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:37.583
Instead of ruining your faces

00:27:37.792 --> 00:27:40.333
you should try to improve them

00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:43.999
by your dignity, by your

00:27:45.458 --> 00:27:47.500
understanding.

00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:51.542
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.500
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

00:27:54.709 --> 00:27:56.458
that what they have to understand,

00:27:56.667 --> 00:28:00.125
what they have to be, how they should be.

00:28:00.999 --> 00:28:04.542
I have always told you

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.166
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.750
very much more than the man.

00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:14.667
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

00:28:14.875 --> 00:28:16.166
doesn’t matter so much.

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:19.625
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

00:28:19.834 --> 00:28:21.750
And men, as it is, don’t know much

00:28:21.959 --> 00:28:23.417
as you know that very well.

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:24.709
Poor things, you know,

00:28:24.917 --> 00:28:26.792
they are

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.041
They are educated only in the universities.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.917
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

00:28:37.083 --> 00:28:38.917
they don’t know anything.

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:45.542
So one should not feel bad about it.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.291
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.917
to see the way men make mistake and

00:28:50.083 --> 00:28:52.583
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

00:28:52.792 --> 00:28:54.834
and they don’t know anything!

00:28:58.834 --> 00:29:03.792
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:05.208
You see, that’s his character.

00:29:05.417 --> 00:29:06.959
It’s all right.

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:09.625
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

00:29:09.834 --> 00:29:12.583
because he really doesn’t know anything!

00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:25.792
Also in art.

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:29.834
I don’t think men know much about art,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.333
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:41.041
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.333
wear all throughout.

00:29:43.709 --> 00:29:47.542
Just one type of dresses they will make

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.875
and that they will make and wear throughout.

00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:52.792
They don’t have any demand.

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:55.750
But women are artistic.

00:29:55.959 --> 00:30:00.458
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:04.041
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.875
Because they live with their saris that they make

00:30:07.041 --> 00:30:09.709
during holidays and things like that.

00:30:09.917 --> 00:30:13.208
So in India is not possible to introduce

00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:15.500
all these dresses.

00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:17.250
In the school maybe,

00:30:17.458 --> 00:30:21.208
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

00:30:21.417 --> 00:30:23.792
So the saris are still on

00:30:23.999 --> 00:30:27.417
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:28.917
it’s so beautiful.

00:30:29.083 --> 00:30:32.041
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.625
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.999
much more with the women, not with the men.

00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:42.041
And so one should see that

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.125
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:50.750
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

00:30:50.959 --> 00:30:55.792
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.333
that should be such.

00:30:57.542 --> 00:30:59.542
But some of the ladies

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.875
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

00:31:04.041 --> 00:31:06.291
in the household, very dictating.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.125
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:13.417
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.041
I have known a person

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.083
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:21.333
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

00:31:21.542 --> 00:31:22.667
He said, “Whenever I sit,

00:31:22.875 --> 00:31:25.999
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

00:31:26.166 --> 00:31:26.750
“Why?”

00:31:26.959 --> 00:31:30.458
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:32.875
my wife will shout at me.”

00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.250
I said, “Why?”

00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:38.417
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

00:31:38.625 --> 00:31:40.083
So she’s so particular.

00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:42.959
I carry a newspaper always with me -

00:31:43.125 --> 00:31:45.667
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:47.500
I said, “It’s too much.”

00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:52.250
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

00:31:56.875 --> 00:32:03.542
So very particular about the whole house

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.375
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:10.375
It’s even worse than a hospital.

00:32:10.583 --> 00:32:14.208
So some women can be very particular about that

00:32:14.417 --> 00:32:17.917
and very methodical, could be.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.166
But normally women should be very loving

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:26.417
and extremely accommodating,

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:31.417
and also being friendly with all the family members,

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:33.458
with everyone.

00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:38.542
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.166
We have a very large family,

00:32:41.375 --> 00:32:43.959
so many brothers and sisters

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:48.166
and everybody one better than the other.

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:51.750
It is so remarkable that

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.041
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.625
or a kind of a fragrance

00:32:59.834 --> 00:33:03.333
that shows an individual personality in them.

00:33:03.542 --> 00:33:07.417
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

00:33:07.625 --> 00:33:10.999
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

00:33:11.166 --> 00:33:15.208
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

00:33:15.417 --> 00:33:19.917
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:21.625
and very humorous.

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:25.250
And they were making fun of everything

00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:27.875
and enjoying life.

00:33:28.542 --> 00:33:32.291
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.208
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

00:33:35.417 --> 00:33:38.250
but there were sixteen thousand people.

00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:41.959
So how could we give these presents?

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:44.500
So the women took out their chains

00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:47.166
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:50.999
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:53.125
and they were making fun of men,

00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:56.291
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.333
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

00:34:00.542 --> 00:34:03.625
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

00:34:03.834 --> 00:34:08.458
and they are very spiritual-minded.

00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:12.625
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

00:34:12.834 --> 00:34:15.375
and will keep a dignity of her own

00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:19.417
and will show by her every gesture

00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:21.458
that she is spiritual.

00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:25.375
This is something so sweet, you know.

00:34:25.583 --> 00:34:28.041
As I was telling you, on one side

00:34:28.291 --> 00:34:30.166
sometimes you feel

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.375
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:39.750
But in the same Japan when I went there,

00:34:39.959 --> 00:34:42.667
I liked their tiles very much.

00:34:43.458 --> 00:34:46.333
So they were building up something,

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:48.750
I liked the design of their tiles.

00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:51.542
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:56.834
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.291
And on the ship a big load

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.709
of those tiles arrived.

00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:05.166
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

00:35:05.375 --> 00:35:06.750
I said, “How did you get it?”

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:08.500
He said, “They brought it to You.”

00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:12.999
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

00:35:13.166 --> 00:35:14.834
can you imagine?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.083
So on one side it is

00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:20.375
a way of expression,

00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:23.667
on the other side is different.

00:35:23.875 --> 00:35:26.375
So one should understand also.

00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:29.291
When somebody gives you something

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.250
you should understand

00:35:31.458 --> 00:35:36.000
what is the significance of that,

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:38.375
and not to feel bad about it.

00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:42.625
The significance of that could be very much great,

00:35:42.834 --> 00:35:44.375
you may not understand.

00:35:44.583 --> 00:35:48.583
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

00:35:48.792 --> 00:35:51.999
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:55.500
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:58.875
that it should be auspicious.

00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:03.291
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.208
Like sometimes

00:36:05.417 --> 00:36:07.834
I have seen little children out of mischief

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:13.583
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

00:36:13.792 --> 00:36:16.500
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

00:36:16.709 --> 00:36:18.208
so they are doing like that.

00:36:18.417 --> 00:36:20.333
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

00:36:20.542 --> 00:36:22.500
it will not please the Goddess.

00:36:22.709 --> 00:36:25.125
So that has to be understood very well

00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:28.999
that you should not try to insult

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:33.125
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.583
If you don’t know, you should find out

00:36:35.792 --> 00:36:37.834
and do it properly.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.625
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

00:36:41.834 --> 00:36:45.041
But the greatest message of this is

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:51.125
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:56.999
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

00:36:57.166 --> 00:36:59.250
and fair play.

00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:01.917
And this was given to Him.

00:37:02.083 --> 00:37:05.166
In the same way we have to feel

00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:11.792
that our expression of gratitude,

00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:18.959
our expression of love should be such that it should be

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:23.458
given to a person who is a symbol

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:26.709
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:32.250
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.375
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

00:37:34.583 --> 00:37:37.875
But if you want to give, then you must give something

00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:41.917
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

00:37:42.458 --> 00:37:45.250
That is one of the lessons you should have

00:37:45.458 --> 00:37:51.959
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

00:37:52.458 --> 00:37:54.792
When He went into the village

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:57.750
and He found there was an old woman

00:37:57.959 --> 00:38:03.667
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

00:38:03.875 --> 00:38:07.750
And she was from the aboriginal

00:38:07.959 --> 00:38:11.500
and she gave Him some

00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:17.375
we call them “ber” - is something like

00:38:20.166 --> 00:38:23.375
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

00:38:23.583 --> 00:38:27.959
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:31.000
and all of them are very sweet.

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:35.375
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:37.333
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

00:38:37.542 --> 00:38:41.125
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:43.250
So please have them.”

00:38:43.458 --> 00:38:45.041
Immediately He took it.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.750
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

00:38:47.959 --> 00:38:50.417
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:52.709
if you have put something in the mouth

00:38:52.917 --> 00:38:54.750
and then you want to give to somebody

00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:58.208
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:01.834
But Shri Rama said

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.959
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:08.166
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

00:39:08.375 --> 00:39:09.500
So His wife says

00:39:09.709 --> 00:39:13.709
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

00:39:13.917 --> 00:39:16.291
this thing, You must give Me.”

00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.834
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:23.959
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

00:39:24.125 --> 00:39:28.208
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:30.458
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

00:39:30.667 --> 00:39:32.542
She said, “Just now you were saying

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.667
all kinds of things against this lady.

00:39:34.875 --> 00:39:36.250
Why do you want to have it?”

00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:39.375
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

00:39:39.583 --> 00:39:42.583
So, see, it shows

00:39:42.792 --> 00:39:45.792
that Shri Rama could see her love,

00:39:45.999 --> 00:39:49.999
her vibrations in those fruits

00:39:50.166 --> 00:39:52.041
that she had offered.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.417
And He could appreciate

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:57.959
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

00:39:58.125 --> 00:40:01.375
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:02.959
This is what it is.

00:40:03.125 --> 00:40:06.500
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

00:40:06.709 --> 00:40:08.500
If you do it with love,

00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:12.542
you will be able to make it auspicious.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:17.999
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:20.083
then it is useless.

00:40:20.291 --> 00:40:26.083
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

00:40:28.792 --> 00:40:31.417
person like Shri Ram,

00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:36.583
and to such a great incarnation.

00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:40.458
She just thought of her love

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:42.709
and she gave it to Him.

00:40:42.917 --> 00:40:46.500
In the same way you have to be very simple,

00:40:46.709 --> 00:40:51.959
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.959
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

00:40:57.125 --> 00:41:00.500
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

00:41:00.709 --> 00:41:03.125
and a very prosperous new year.

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:07.542
May God bless you all.

00:41:50.583 --> 00:41:53.750
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

00:41:53.959 --> 00:41:57.667
That is, when you understand

00:41:59.625 --> 00:42:02.125
the value of money

00:42:04.583 --> 00:42:07.333
and when you are saturated

00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:10.959
and you are fed up.

00:42:11.125 --> 00:42:14.250
From inside you get detached,

00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:20.125
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

00:42:20.333 --> 00:42:22.959
that is Mahalakshmi.

00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:27.083
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:30.125
which is the spiritual awakening.

00:42:30.333 --> 00:42:34.875
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:37.875
this desire started

00:42:38.041 --> 00:42:42.667
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

00:42:42.875 --> 00:42:45.375
and that’s how you are all here.

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:50.000
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:52.709
that you were seeking the truth.

00:42:52.917 --> 00:42:56.667
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:58.667
So this Mahalakshmi

00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:01.625
is very important for you also.

00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:06.250
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:09.333
which came out of the Mother Earth.

00:43:09.542 --> 00:43:12.750
But they themselves didn’t know that

00:43:12.959 --> 00:43:19.375
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:22.375
“O Ambe, awaken.”

00:43:22.583 --> 00:43:24.333
Ambe is the Kundalini.

00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:28.583
So why in Mahalakshmi’s temple they sang?

00:43:28.792 --> 00:43:31.250
You can understand that, why

00:43:31.458 --> 00:43:35.000
in that temple they started singing

00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:39.166
the song of “Jogawa” by which to raise the Kundalini.
