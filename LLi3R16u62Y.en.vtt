00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:13.920
So now the other center which we have here is very&nbsp;
important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790
This is the center Vi-shuddha.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.231
One is “shuddha”, means “pure”, but&nbsp;
“vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.360
This has got sixteen petals, as&nbsp;
we have got the cervical plexus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.660
expressed in the gross, which has&nbsp;
also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.081
It tallies with medical science completely.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.544
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed&nbsp;
upon by the deity of Shri Krishna.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.207
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution of&nbsp;
the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.740
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.180
He is the one who resides as the Primordial&nbsp;
Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.980
When Mohammed Sahib talked of&nbsp;
Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.460
This is the finger which represents&nbsp;
this center, and He said: “Put these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.040
into your ears and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’&nbsp;
— you get in connection with the Virat."

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.016
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to&nbsp;
make you in contact with the whole.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.010
It makes you in contact with the whole.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.000
It’s not that it limits you, but&nbsp;
it makes you one with the whole.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.620
So one must understand that what you have to&nbsp;
achieve in your realization is just not talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.735
of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about&nbsp;
— which is absurd. People don’t understand.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.740
That in Oxford Street we find people with all&nbsp;
these nonsensical things going on; begging,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.378
asking for alms… I feel it’s such an insult to&nbsp;
Shri Krishna that people in His name are begging.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.200
But it’s done in all religious movements&nbsp;
that people beg in the name of God.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.180
There is no need to beg.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.360
First you equip yourself with the blessings of&nbsp;
God that there is no need for you to beg at all.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.900
And begging is against God’s&nbsp;
realization, against Self-realization.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.092
You must have self-esteem.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.040
That’s one thing very important.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.877
If you do not have self-esteem,&nbsp;
you cannot get realization.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.640
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.580
It’s absolutely absurd, it’s a showing-off&nbsp;
thing, which is of no use to yourself.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.191
By doing this, you are really&nbsp;
corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.320
But if you take to the right path, if this&nbsp;
center is awakened, your hands become connected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.213
with the Primordial Being, and you become,&nbsp;
your hands become collectively conscious.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.920
Medically, they accept that the extremities have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.620
got something to do with the&nbsp;
sympathetic nervous system.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.999
That far, no more than that.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.300
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed that&nbsp;
the vibration starts flowing through your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.126
hand when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.560
And these vibrations, when you&nbsp;
want to find out what are these,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.503
then you’ll be amazed they relate&nbsp;
to your centers within yourself.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.440
Even if you get ten children who are&nbsp;
realized souls, and tie their eyes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.160
and ask them about a person who is&nbsp;
sitting before them what’s wrong with him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.600
they will say one finger, or this&nbsp;
finger, or this finger, or two fingers.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.060
Because you can feel the charring, you&nbsp;
can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.459
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.654
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,&nbsp;
then you must know that the person has to die.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.114
So many things you can know, all the permutations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:10.140
of these seven centers and this&nbsp;
one: one, five, and … six and seven.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.564
So we have seven centers.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.540
To understand about the centers, first you&nbsp;
must get your realization, that is important.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.025
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations&nbsp;
are coming, going, coming, going.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.300
It is not steady.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.160
First you must steady yourself.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.831
Then you can find out, from your&nbsp;
hands, what are the centers catching.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.831
Because these vibrations are nothing but&nbsp;
the Power of God is flowing through you.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.940
They understand, these&nbsp;
vibrations, they co-ordinate.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.260
They are life’s force.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.100
They are the one who create all these&nbsp;
living things like … they are the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.612
who sprout a seed, they are the one&nbsp;
who transform the flower into a fruit.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.912
All living work is done by these vibrations,&nbsp;
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.440
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,&nbsp;
and all-pervading Power of God.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.140
That starts flowing through&nbsp;
you, first time you feel them.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.280
Yesterday, many people felt it, and people&nbsp;
were very happy that so many felt it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:25.458
because that’s a sign that here many&nbsp;
people are going to get Realization.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.479
You don’t have to go to anybody, you have&nbsp;
to just practice a little bit and find out.

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.014
You’ll become such an expert.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:42.662
One person in India who got realization has so far&nbsp;
given realization to at least ten thousand people.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.329
In a village.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.005
Many villages.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.520
He’s a very ordinary man.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.154
We wanted him to come, but there was a kind&nbsp;
of a visa problem, so he could not come.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.480
He’s a very simple farmer,&nbsp;
and he got his Realization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.480
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga&nbsp;
that you’ll be amazed; he has not been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.860
to any university, to any college or&nbsp;
anything, but he’s so knowledgeable.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.650
Because once you have these&nbsp;
vibrations they guide you.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:17.828
So the Spirit sitting in your heart guides you&nbsp;
and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.300
If you have to ask a question: “Mother,&nbsp;
is there God?” — if you ask this question,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.385
immediately there will be a tremendous&nbsp;
flow saying that it is there.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.680
Now, how to understand that these are the&nbsp;
vibrations of God, also this question can come.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.107
We can judge them relatively.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.980
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.220
people invited Me to speak in a place which&nbsp;
was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.700
They said, “She’s not a brahmin,&nbsp;
so we will not have her here."

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.360
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the&nbsp;
newspaper — because Her name has gone in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.890
newspaper — we’ll tell them that these people are&nbsp;
so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her."

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.340
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad&nbsp;
name, so they said, “All right, let’s have her."

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.580
These people never told Me what had happened.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.420
Suddenly I said, “Those who think&nbsp;
who are brahmins, come down."

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.420
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.760
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma.
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me."

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.460
And they just started shaking&nbsp;
like this, going back.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.180
I said, “What’s happening to you?” So&nbsp;
they said, “Mother, you are Shakti (Power),&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.200
that’s why it is happening to me, to&nbsp;
us,” but I said, “What about others?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.400
It’s not happening to others."

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.480
So they turned round and said, “Look at&nbsp;
these, they are also doing like this."

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.280
I said, “Ask them from where do they come."

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.913
They went and asked them; they said, “We are&nbsp;
coming from the lunatic asylum of Thane."

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.780
So these fanatics, who believed&nbsp;
that they were brahmins,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.017
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.660
And they believed that they were brahmins,&nbsp;
they were not supposed to touch anybody,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.340
they were “untouchables” people, and they&nbsp;
were … the one who gave them realization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.712
was from so-called untouchable, a shoemaker.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.300
Now he’s become their guru, of all these&nbsp;
brahmins, and he’s teaching them about God.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.371
So this center gives you the&nbsp;
power to be one with the whole.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:20.100
It has many powers, but the main power it&nbsp;
gives you is the power to be one with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:28.308
whole and to have all the powers of that&nbsp;
deity within you awakened, so that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.041
become aware and make others also aware of it.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.020
Those people who talk too much catch on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.220
the right Vishuddhi, those who do&nbsp;
not talk at all catch on the left.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.620
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.340
those who think they are all right and&nbsp;
aggressive, they catch on the right.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.240
It’s like that.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:55.380
So this has to be understood in right&nbsp;
perspective: that if you misuse this center,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.720
what happens to you, so how you should&nbsp;
give yourself a balance to improve that.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.093
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is&nbsp;
this: that when you get them realization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.060
they are separated from themselves.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.300
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother,&nbsp;
my Agnya Chakra is catching."

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.660
So, if you ask them, “Really?”&nbsp;
— “Yes, Mother, very much."

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.000
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.760
But can you imagine anybody saying,&nbsp;
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.300
Because you are separated from&nbsp;
yourself, you see your ego,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.611
the big balloonic-like thing, and you&nbsp;
say, “Mother, please remove my ego."

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.600
That is how people talk to Me.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.920
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,&nbsp;
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.680
You better cure it, I must&nbsp;
stop my talking too much."

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.880
So you start correcting yourself&nbsp;
because you get separated from yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.180
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.880
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.760
I would like to clean it, I’m&nbsp;
not identified with the spot.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.660
So, that’s how it happens; you are&nbsp;
no more identified with yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.740
and you start seeing the faults&nbsp;
in you, and you try to correct it.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.160
That’s how you become a beautiful&nbsp;
person — by your own attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.079
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.
