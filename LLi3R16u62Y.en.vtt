WEBVTT

00:07.579 --> 00:13.920
So now the other center which we have here is very
important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.790
This is the center Vi-shuddha.

00:16.980 --> 00:22.231
One is “shuddha”, means “pure”, but
“vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.360
This has got sixteen petals, as
we have got the cervical plexus

00:28.140 --> 00:33.660
expressed in the gross, which has
also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

00:33.660 --> 00:37.081
It tallies with medical science completely.

00:37.200 --> 00:44.544
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed
upon by the deity of Shri Krishna.

00:45.060 --> 00:52.207
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution of
the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there

00:52.320 --> 00:56.740
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

00:58.080 --> 01:06.180
He is the one who resides as the Primordial
Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

01:06.180 --> 01:10.980
When Mohammed Sahib talked of
Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

01:10.980 --> 01:17.460
This is the finger which represents
this center, and He said: “Put these

01:17.460 --> 01:26.040
into your ears and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’
— you get in connection with the Virat."

01:26.040 --> 01:32.016
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to
make you in contact with the whole.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.010
It makes you in contact with the whole.

01:35.010 --> 01:40.000
It’s not that it limits you, but
it makes you one with the whole.

01:40.200 --> 01:46.620
So one must understand that what you have to
achieve in your realization is just not talk

01:46.620 --> 01:51.735
of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about
— which is absurd. People don’t understand.

01:51.900 --> 01:58.740
That in Oxford Street we find people with all
these nonsensical things going on; begging,

01:58.740 --> 02:07.378
asking for alms… I feel it’s such an insult to
Shri Krishna that people in His name are begging.

02:07.560 --> 02:13.200
But it’s done in all religious movements
that people beg in the name of God.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.180
There is no need to beg.

02:15.180 --> 02:21.360
First you equip yourself with the blessings of
God that there is no need for you to beg at all.

02:21.360 --> 02:27.900
And begging is against God’s
realization, against Self-realization.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.092
You must have self-esteem.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.040
That’s one thing very important.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.877
If you do not have self-esteem,
you cannot get realization.

02:36.180 --> 02:38.640
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

02:38.640 --> 02:44.580
It’s absolutely absurd, it’s a showing-off
thing, which is of no use to yourself.

02:44.580 --> 02:50.191
By doing this, you are really
corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

02:50.580 --> 02:58.320
But if you take to the right path, if this
center is awakened, your hands become connected

02:58.320 --> 03:04.213
with the Primordial Being, and you become,
your hands become collectively conscious.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.920
Medically, they accept that the extremities have

03:07.920 --> 03:10.620
got something to do with the
sympathetic nervous system.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.999
That far, no more than that.

03:13.140 --> 03:18.300
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed that
the vibration starts flowing through your

03:18.300 --> 03:21.126
hand when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

03:21.600 --> 03:25.560
And these vibrations, when you
want to find out what are these,

03:25.560 --> 03:29.503
then you’ll be amazed they relate
to your centers within yourself.

03:29.700 --> 03:34.440
Even if you get ten children who are
realized souls, and tie their eyes,

03:34.440 --> 03:38.160
and ask them about a person who is
sitting before them what’s wrong with him,

03:38.160 --> 03:42.600
they will say one finger, or this
finger, or this finger, or two fingers.

03:42.600 --> 03:48.060
Because you can feel the charring, you
can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.459
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

03:51.600 --> 03:57.654
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,
then you must know that the person has to die.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.114
So many things you can know, all the permutations

04:01.320 --> 04:10.140
of these seven centers and this
one: one, five, and … six and seven.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.564
So we have seven centers.

04:13.440 --> 04:18.540
To understand about the centers, first you
must get your realization, that is important.

04:18.540 --> 04:23.025
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations
are coming, going, coming, going.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.300
It is not steady.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.160
First you must steady yourself.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.831
Then you can find out, from your
hands, what are the centers catching.

04:31.020 --> 04:36.831
Because these vibrations are nothing but
the Power of God is flowing through you.

04:37.140 --> 04:41.940
They understand, these
vibrations, they co-ordinate.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.260
They are life’s force.

04:43.260 --> 04:50.100
They are the one who create all these
living things like … they are the one

04:50.100 --> 04:57.612
who sprout a seed, they are the one
who transform the flower into a fruit.

04:57.900 --> 05:05.912
All living work is done by these vibrations,
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,

05:06.120 --> 05:10.440
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,
and all-pervading Power of God.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.140
That starts flowing through
you, first time you feel them.

05:13.140 --> 05:17.280
Yesterday, many people felt it, and people
were very happy that so many felt it,

05:17.280 --> 05:25.458
because that’s a sign that here many
people are going to get Realization.

05:26.220 --> 05:31.479
You don’t have to go to anybody, you have
to just practice a little bit and find out.

05:31.479 --> 05:34.014
You’ll become such an expert.

05:34.260 --> 05:42.662
One person in India who got realization has so far
given realization to at least ten thousand people.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.329
In a village.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.005
Many villages.

05:46.140 --> 05:47.520
He’s a very ordinary man.

05:47.520 --> 05:53.154
We wanted him to come, but there was a kind
of a visa problem, so he could not come.

05:53.280 --> 05:57.480
He’s a very simple farmer,
and he got his Realization,

05:57.480 --> 06:00.480
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga
that you’ll be amazed; he has not been

06:00.480 --> 06:04.860
to any university, to any college or
anything, but he’s so knowledgeable.

06:04.860 --> 06:08.650
Because once you have these
vibrations they guide you.

06:08.940 --> 06:17.828
So the Spirit sitting in your heart guides you
and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

06:17.940 --> 06:24.300
If you have to ask a question: “Mother,
is there God?” — if you ask this question,

06:24.300 --> 06:29.385
immediately there will be a tremendous
flow saying that it is there.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.680
Now, how to understand that these are the
vibrations of God, also this question can come.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.107
We can judge them relatively.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.980
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,

06:41.700 --> 06:47.220
people invited Me to speak in a place which
was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

06:47.220 --> 06:50.700
They said, “She’s not a brahmin,
so we will not have her here."

06:50.700 --> 06:54.360
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the
newspaper — because Her name has gone in the

06:54.360 --> 06:58.890
newspaper — we’ll tell them that these people are
so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her."

06:58.890 --> 07:02.340
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad
name, so they said, “All right, let’s have her."

07:02.880 --> 07:05.580
These people never told Me what had happened.

07:05.580 --> 07:09.420
Suddenly I said, “Those who think
who are brahmins, come down."

07:10.080 --> 07:12.420
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

07:13.020 --> 07:17.760
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma.
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me."

07:17.760 --> 07:20.460
And they just started shaking
like this, going back.

07:20.460 --> 07:24.180
I said, “What’s happening to you?” So
they said, “Mother, you are Shakti (Power),

07:24.180 --> 07:28.200
that’s why it is happening to me, to
us,” but I said, “What about others?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.400
It’s not happening to others."

07:29.400 --> 07:33.480
So they turned round and said, “Look at
these, they are also doing like this."

07:33.480 --> 07:35.280
I said, “Ask them from where do they come."

07:35.280 --> 07:39.913
They went and asked them; they said, “We are
coming from the lunatic asylum of Thane."

07:40.020 --> 07:42.780
So these fanatics, who believed
that they were brahmins,

07:42.780 --> 07:47.017
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.660
And they believed that they were brahmins,
they were not supposed to touch anybody,

07:51.660 --> 07:56.340
they were “untouchables” people, and they
were … the one who gave them realization

07:56.340 --> 08:01.712
was from so-called untouchable, a shoemaker.

08:01.920 --> 08:06.300
Now he’s become their guru, of all these
brahmins, and he’s teaching them about God.

08:07.560 --> 08:13.371
So this center gives you the
power to be one with the whole.

08:13.560 --> 08:20.100
It has many powers, but the main power it
gives you is the power to be one with the

08:20.100 --> 08:28.308
whole and to have all the powers of that
deity within you awakened, so that you can

08:28.680 --> 08:34.041
become aware and make others also aware of it.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.020
Those people who talk too much catch on

08:37.020 --> 08:41.220
the right Vishuddhi, those who do
not talk at all catch on the left.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.620
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,

08:43.620 --> 08:47.340
those who think they are all right and
aggressive, they catch on the right.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.240
It’s like that.

08:48.240 --> 08:55.380
So this has to be understood in right
perspective: that if you misuse this center,

08:55.380 --> 09:00.720
what happens to you, so how you should
give yourself a balance to improve that.

09:00.720 --> 09:07.093
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is
this: that when you get them realization,

09:07.260 --> 09:09.060
they are separated from themselves.

09:09.060 --> 09:12.300
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother,
my Agnya Chakra is catching."

09:12.300 --> 09:15.660
So, if you ask them, “Really?”
— “Yes, Mother, very much."

09:15.660 --> 09:20.000
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

09:20.220 --> 09:23.760
But can you imagine anybody saying,
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

09:23.760 --> 09:27.300
Because you are separated from
yourself, you see your ego,

09:27.300 --> 09:31.611
the big balloonic-like thing, and you
say, “Mother, please remove my ego."

09:31.800 --> 09:33.600
That is how people talk to Me.

09:33.600 --> 09:37.920
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.680
You better cure it, I must
stop my talking too much."

09:40.680 --> 09:44.880
So you start correcting yourself
because you get separated from yourself,

09:44.880 --> 09:48.180
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.880
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,

09:50.880 --> 09:53.760
I would like to clean it, I’m
not identified with the spot.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.660
So, that’s how it happens; you are
no more identified with yourself,

09:57.660 --> 10:01.740
and you start seeing the faults
in you, and you try to correct it.

10:01.740 --> 10:05.160
That’s how you become a beautiful
person — by your own attention,

10:05.160 --> 10:10.079
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.
