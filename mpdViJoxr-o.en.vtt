00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.966
Many years ago, in our country of India,

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:10.108
people started working on the Pingala Nadi.

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:14.021
As you must
have heard about King Bali

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.404
when the Vamana Avatar took place.

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:24.691
King Bali was considered a religious man.

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:32.458
But he performed Yagnas; people
perform Yagnas for love love power.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.781
By performing Yagnas, you can
control the five great elements.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:45.075
The desire or inspiration behind it
is to take control of the whole world.

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:48.074
To absorb the power of the
entire world within oneself.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:51.275
To become the emperor
of the whole world.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.341
Then, the influence of
the demons increases in it.

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.950
The demons become powerful in this.

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:04.232
And even among the
gods, there are such desires.

00:01:05.508 --> 00:01:12.975
But the desire of the demons is stronger
because they lack dharma (righteousness).

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:18.720
And when there are no
brakes on such a vehicle, it rolls

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:23.141
downhill uncontrollably, just
like their desires flow unchecked.

00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:27.805
In earlier times, many dubious
types of gurus were present to

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.832
assist in this, and
surprisingly, some of them

00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:35.859
were Brahmins, considered
to be realized souls,

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:40.848
like Vishwamitra. It is
believed that Vishwamitra

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:44.191
taught Bali, who may
be called pure form.

00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.341
Pure form has many aspects, but
its only the effort of the pure form.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:56.908
So its only effort by which you
may work on the Pingala Nadi,

00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:01.313
and its efforts were
told that by performing

00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:04.541
Yagnas and penances,
one could attain powers.

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.700
So, that was to please Brahma Dev.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:13.941
Pleasing Brahma cannot bring
about your welfare or transformation.

00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:20.488
You cannot become a superhuman;
however, it might be possible

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:26.141
to gain dominance over the
five elements like water, air, etc.,

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:33.075
or to acquire powers within that
enable you to kill or destroy everyone.

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:41.275
These powers begin with
Gayatri and other mantras.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.825
There are seven such powers
within us that you can attain.

00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:51.532
To attain them, if one does
not follow dharma, many

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:56.041
distortions can arise, as seen
in the example of King Bali.

00:02:58.158 --> 00:03:03.963
When King Bali began
performing penances, as advised by

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:11.408
Vishwamitra to perform penance
and he asked for a boon from Brahma

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:18.091
to destroy and kill all the gods.

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:27.841
At that time, you know, the
Vamana Avatar took place.

00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:35.858
The significance of Vamana the
middle power that we call as Sattv Guni,

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:39.856
is the power of Vishnu,
known as Vaishnavi Shakti,

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.608
due to we today evolved
from amoeba to human,

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:46.408
That power (Shakti) took
incarnation to bring balance,

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:51.191
As you are going on one extreme
that made you more powerful

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:55.275
and with that you start killing
and destroying every one.

00:03:55.608 --> 00:04:00.225
Which we call as "NOT CLEAR- orion
in" or ego oriented, that what is called.

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:07.225
Such ego-oriented societies,
as seen today in the West,

00:04:08.283 --> 00:04:12.624
where wars occur, people are killed, and

00:04:14.892 --> 00:04:17.795
the desire to establish
one's power everywhere

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.204
led the British to
rule our country;

00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:23.802
America wants to dominate
us through economic

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:28.158
development, then now
the Russians want to rule us.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.425
At such times, the birth of a
sattvic (pure) power is necessary;

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:36.648
If that is not born, these people will
crush the entire world with their egos;

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.908
although it doesn't bring them welfare
either. They eventually descend into hell.

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:47.484
But the agony of
those who are killed

00:04:47.508 --> 00:04:51.725
by them, the
suffering they endure;

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:57.655
leads to many
disasters and calamities,

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:03.408
causing great harm
to saintly people.

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:06.341
Many people descend into hell,

00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:11.858
They continuously nurture
their demonic powers.

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:17.241
And because of that demonic
power, they do not even realize

00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:20.983
that we are doing harm to others,
or we are putting them at a loss.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:25.435
And for our own, own selfish
motives how we are forcing

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:29.608
and riding on their heads,
we are destroying them.

00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:33.308
What type of social
system is it, i don't see.

00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:37.891
In the entire world the
social system is ego oriented.

00:05:38.358 --> 00:05:42.838
At this time we may talk about on
the issue of balance in our country.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:48.941
In balance, the first thing is
to establish relegion of oneself.

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.781
When righteousness
awakens within a man ;

00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:56.770
instantly he may give up
any of his extreme tendencies.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:03.610
While your country is progressing
today, you must observe that

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:09.416
those who claim to be highly
advanced and proclaim their happiness

00:06:09.525 --> 00:06:11.925
They, in fact, are not happy at all.

00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:18.106
By the grace of God, in this
age of Kali Yuga, everything

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.413
that happens in every corner
of the world is known to all.

00:06:21.657 --> 00:06:26.123
You must have heard of the
Bermuda Triangle on this Earth.

00:06:26.347 --> 00:06:31.857
A complete arrangement of the
gates of hell has been made there;

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.555
how were the gates
of hell created there?

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:39.024
From there, many people
were taken as slaves,

00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:43.555
slaves were traded
there from many countries.

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:46.441
All those who were
taken from there...

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:49.579
The cries of those taken as
slaves settled there, and those cries

00:06:49.603 --> 00:06:52.274
created the Bermuda Triangle,
into which everything is swallowed.

00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.340
These demonic forces come in many ways,

00:06:55.867 --> 00:06:58.799
like you've heard about
Ananda Margis nowadays,

00:06:58.823 --> 00:07:01.499
and you've heard
about many such groups.

00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:05.353
And all these gurus
who are roaming around

00:07:05.377 --> 00:07:09.706
these days are also
engaged in such practices.

00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:15.743
Yes, some of them work
with the Ida Nadi as well.

00:07:15.994 --> 00:07:18.906
But there are many
who work with the Pingala

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.843
Nadi, and they have
developed such powers

00:07:22.144 --> 00:07:25.106
that they bring the
deceased from our collective

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.477
supra-conscious on Pingla Nadi and
put into you, and make you do things;

00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:33.763
becoming excessively dynamic,

00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:38.973
wanting to be more progressive
than the world's progress,

00:07:39.107 --> 00:07:43.256
or if everyone else is poor, one
person becoming extremely rich—

00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:47.123
this is what we call cancer,

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:50.840
a malignanance, too much
growth of a cell is malignance.

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.413
Then, that cell touches another,
and it also wants to become malignant.

00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:57.399
When a person sees
someone becoming very rich,

00:07:57.423 --> 00:07:59.258
they think, 'Why shouldn't
I become rich too?'

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:04.169
They don’t see what that person's
true reality is, how their life is going,

00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:06.283
what is happening in their home,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.790
whether they are truly happy or not.

00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:12.909
If they have wealth, they want it too,
and then the next person wants it as well.

00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:15.731
They see that someone has
power; if they become Prime

00:08:15.755 --> 00:08:17.658
Minister, then I must
become Prime Minister too;

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.043
if they become Governor, then
I must become Governor too.

00:08:21.283 --> 00:08:23.496
In this way, this malignancy spreads;

00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:27.489
in Sattva, a person is content.

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:31.927
That contentment is maintained because
they find joy in their dharma

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:37.830
They derive pleasure from
their dharma and enjoy it,

00:08:38.403 --> 00:08:42.030
and through Sahaja Yoga,
you realize how significant it is—

00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:47.256
no wealth, whatever in the world, no power

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:54.469
can not compare to the bliss that
comes from the soul residing in your heart.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.469
There is nothing greater
in the world than that joy.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.496
You know in Sahaja Yoga that many people
have given up alcohol and other things

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:11.910
because when the joy of the Divine within
the soul in the heart starts to flow,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.343
then these things naturally fall
away; there is no need for lectures,

00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:19.103
no need to create a fuss;
they are abandoned naturally.

00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:24.063
The source of joy changes,
so your priorities change,

00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:30.383
and we transform accordingly. This
is the great benefit of Sahaja Yoga—

00:09:30.796 --> 00:09:32.797
it establishes your dharma.

00:09:33.597 --> 00:09:38.143
Untill you fully establish your dharma, you
will not experience the joy of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:38.863 --> 00:09:44.503
Hypocrisy does not work here;
dharma must be ingrained within you.

00:09:44.863 --> 00:09:48.809
You know that dharma is
established in the Nabhi Chakra.

00:09:49.116 --> 00:09:51.929
If there is any distortion
in the Nabhi Chakra,

00:09:52.183 --> 00:09:55.371
then no matter how much
effort you put into Sahaja

00:09:55.395 --> 00:09:58.583
Yoga, it will all be in
vain, and our efforts too will be wasted;

00:09:58.608 --> 00:10:00.616
therefore, you must first
establish your dharma.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.976
I have given you many methods to
do this and mentioned it many times.

00:10:09.316 --> 00:10:13.795
Now that our country is moving towards
progress, to grow further

00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:17.086
towards becoming greater
and aligning ourselves

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.230
with those nations that
walk around the world as wealthy nations,

00:10:20.543 --> 00:10:24.370
our countrymen must
consider whether

00:10:25.997 --> 00:10:30.183
we should take in everything they have
or if we need to balance ourselves with it.

00:10:31.303 --> 00:10:32.863
This thought is crucial;

00:10:36.672 --> 00:10:39.763
we are in search of joy, not to become

00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:44.456
such that our powers

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.833
the powers, within us, dominate on others.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.462
Nor do we wish to shape
ourselves in such a way

00:10:53.537 --> 00:10:55.803
that we bring suffering to others.

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:59.883
In Sahaja Yoga, if you transcend,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.043
after transcending, when you
establish your own dharma,

00:11:03.283 --> 00:11:07.315
you will see that money does
not come to you, but Lakshmi does,

00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:11.746
Lakshmi comes to you, money
does not, but Lakshmi does.

00:11:12.107 --> 00:11:15.935
There is a big difference between
money and Lakshmi, and many

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:18.411
times I have explained to you
what money and Lakshmi are.

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:24.371
Lakshmi is a satisfying thing; it is
beauty, glory, and it has a radiance.

00:11:25.439 --> 00:11:29.423
Being wealthy is one thing,
and being rich is another.

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:35.131
In earlier times, I
told you when Bali

00:11:35.155 --> 00:11:37.463
became too powerful,
Vamana avatar was born.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.650
He came and corrected his mind. Similarly,
when Mahishasura was killed by the Goddess,

00:11:42.916 --> 00:11:46.716
When Devi came and killed Mahisasur;
after Mahishasura was killed his wife

00:11:47.236 --> 00:11:50.369
Mahishi cried a lot and pleased
Brahma by performing austerities,

00:11:50.556 --> 00:11:53.040
It is not difficult to
please Brahma, by

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.444
performing penance and
rituals, she pleased Brahma,

00:11:57.783 --> 00:12:03.263
and after pleasing him, if you look at your
own body, you will see that our vagus nerve

00:12:03.557 --> 00:12:06.770
on one side extends quite far, but
on the other side, it stops halfway.

00:12:07.437 --> 00:12:11.876
If someone fills this gap with
effort, they can become powerful.

00:12:12.383 --> 00:12:16.023
That is, by practicing Hatha
Yoga or performing penance,

00:12:16.143 --> 00:12:18.063
people used to acquire this power.

00:12:18.877 --> 00:12:21.470
So that demoness also acquired this power.

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:24.601
She asked Brahma to
grant her a boon such that

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:33.616
neither Shiva nor Vishnu could defeat her;

00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:36.763
meaning both their powers
should not work against her.

00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:38.520
And she was a demoness herself,

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.176
she killed all the demons, and the
mother of the demons, Aditi wept.

00:12:45.813 --> 00:12:51.317
After that, as you know, a child was born

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.470
who eventually destroyed
Mahishi completely.

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:02.683
At that time too, they
performed penance and rituals,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.414
and somehow pleased Brahma,

00:13:06.803 --> 00:13:11.030
And in accordance with his nature
Brahma granted them blessings

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:16.070
that they could attain physical
strength and intelligence.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.986
But they could not attain the power of
love, only physical and mental strength.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:29.816
By attaining this strength, they could
dominate others' bodies and minds.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.086
Such a person becomes extremely
intelligent and performs such actions that

00:13:35.803 --> 00:13:38.603
people would think he is very powerful.

00:13:39.123 --> 00:13:42.372
However, in Sahaja Yoga,
even Brahma is very controlled,

00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:45.401
and such powers cannot
be obtained by anyone.

00:13:46.012 --> 00:13:48.789
So, the demons thought
that if we cannot gain these

00:13:48.813 --> 00:13:51.590
powers, if we cannot obtain
direct power from Brahma,

00:13:51.744 --> 00:13:54.140
then why not bring those
who have died into the

00:13:54.164 --> 00:13:57.032
collective supra-consciousness
and use them instead?

00:13:59.177 --> 00:14:02.943
And now they are using those people,
as you know, in practices like trance,

00:14:03.099 --> 00:14:07.277
they are utilizing these
supra-conscious spirits,

00:14:07.455 --> 00:14:12.499
and they will completely
freeze everyone's Kundalini;

00:14:13.255 --> 00:14:16.354
because as soon as the
Kundalini sees that it's under the

00:14:16.378 --> 00:14:19.477
control of these spirits, it
immediately freezes itself;

00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:22.699
and then it refuses to
melt or rise in any way.

00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:25.944
However, I told you in London
that many of their disciples

00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:27.745
have achieved
Self-realization through Sahaja

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:29.701
Yoga; surprisingly, they
have also achieved it.

00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:34.168
But the power of Brahma
can also be controlled by us,

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.279
we can completely control the power
of Brahma,

00:14:37.435 --> 00:14:40.678
and we can also fully
control the power of

00:14:40.702 --> 00:14:44.501
Shiva, which we refer
to as Mahakali's power.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.178
You may not know, but
you have already been doing

00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:49.190
this; you have been
doing it from the beginning.

00:14:49.745 --> 00:14:52.544
For example, you now remove
obstacles for many people,

00:14:52.578 --> 00:14:54.301
after all, with whose
power are you doing

00:14:54.355 --> 00:14:56.167
this? You are doing it
with Mahakali's power.

00:14:57.633 --> 00:14:59.944
Many of you may not have realized this,

00:15:00.189 --> 00:15:04.029
but you have begun
to think of many innovative things

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:05.226
and have started doing new tasks;
for example, those who never did

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.310
decoration work before have
started doing new tasks; for example,

00:15:06.334 --> 00:15:07.649
those who never did decoration work
before have started doing new tasks; for

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:08.988
example, those who never did decoration
work before have now started doing it;

00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:11.011
a lot of creativity has come into them,

00:15:11.144 --> 00:15:13.244
and those who practice
Sahaja also exhibit a lot

00:15:13.268 --> 00:15:15.368
of creativity; they are
using the power of Brahma.

00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:19.743
But in fact, we have mostly
utilized the Vaishnavi power.

00:15:19.811 --> 00:15:23.900
Today, we have the responsibility
of the welfare of the entire

00:15:23.924 --> 00:15:27.945
world; we must grant
Self-realization to the whole world,

00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:31.369
Therefore, we must
utilize the Vaishnavi power.

00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:34.855
When we emphasize the
Vaishnavi power over other

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:38.145
powers, you will see that
this power will be activated.

00:15:38.523 --> 00:15:44.656
For example, a small thing, let
me tell you, it started in Rahuri.

00:15:45.568 --> 00:15:48.623
The people of Rahuri
presented an idea before me

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:51.736
that they wanted to establish
a Sahaja Yoga school,

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.915
but before that, they
started elevating their

00:15:55.939 --> 00:15:59.669
power, which means
by vibrating the water,

00:16:00.247 --> 00:16:04.790
they began planting gardens, and
from that, they started growing fruits;

00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:10.501
they removed many
diseases from fruits and seeds

00:16:10.692 --> 00:16:13.758
they gave vibrations to cows,
and those cows began giving milk.

00:16:14.536 --> 00:16:18.046
You should implement this, and
if you open a Sahaja Yoga school

00:16:18.225 --> 00:16:20.602
and in that school, you
help the children achieve

00:16:20.626 --> 00:16:23.402
Self-realization through
Sahaja Yoga, and implement it

00:16:23.558 --> 00:16:27.674
according to Indian culture, the
way our country has traditionally

00:16:27.698 --> 00:16:31.878
run schools in a simple manner,
we must establish such schools,

00:16:31.967 --> 00:16:35.167
so that the children grow
up to be very content.

00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:39.723
In an ego-oriented society, people
lose all sense; they lose all decency;

00:16:40.368 --> 00:16:43.620
They have no thoughts; you see
women wearing all sorts of clothes,

00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:46.767
what sort of dressup and on the other
hand, what kind of arrogance they display

00:16:46.967 --> 00:16:50.278
They move around in the most
vulgar way. Men have lost all sense.

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:52.766
That is, there is hardly
any difference between a

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.590
prostitute and a woman
nowadays, in terms of their thoughts.

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:59.948
This means that ego oriented
society, in an ego-oriented society,

00:17:00.678 --> 00:17:03.078
a person's religion gets corroded,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.345
Human are also sticky to it (Unclear)

00:17:06.723 --> 00:17:10.112
just as more you will move on a
string, it weakens as you stretch it,

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:12.344
and when religion breaks,
society breaks down, and

00:17:12.368 --> 00:17:14.534
when society breaks down,
everything gets destroyed.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.734
When everything is destroyed,
every person becomes isolated.

00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:20.045
When people are isolated,
it becomes like in foreign

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.623
lands where things like
cannabis, spirits, etc., start.

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:28.187
You can see the map of
today's ego-oriented society;

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:32.143
Women at home, children are crying in
distressed at, while you are playing cards.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.854
There is no love for children;

00:17:35.588 --> 00:17:41.721
girls are making themselves
attractive, as if a prostitute.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.477
They have no self-respect,

00:17:44.565 --> 00:17:47.232
It is surprising that people
do not notice such behavior,

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:53.432
and how people sink to such indecency;
it is amazing how they behave like this.

00:17:53.588 --> 00:17:57.210
But it is described in our scriptures
where people will end up in the Kali Yuga.

00:17:57.344 --> 00:17:59.743
This is due to the
ego-oriented society and the

00:17:59.767 --> 00:18:02.166
excess of Rajogun
(the quality of activity).

00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:06.647
It has happened before,
but it used to affect only a few

00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:11.655
kings or people; today, this
condition is affecting everyone.

00:18:12.989 --> 00:18:15.211
Just like cancer spreads
throughout the body, now this

00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:22.375
Now it's balance will only come through
religion; one must adhere to religion.

00:18:25.078 --> 00:18:27.759
One must adhere to
religion completely, and firstly

00:18:27.783 --> 00:18:30.411
three things, told in
religion, must be avoided.

00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:32.789
The first thing is alcohol.

00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:37.566
Alcohol destroys religion because
it destroys your consciousness.

00:18:38.455 --> 00:18:45.010
The second thing is tobacco; tobacco,
which is vegitable for demons.

00:18:45.611 --> 00:18:50.667
the moment you consume tobacco or
any intoxicant, it leads to the left side;

00:18:51.189 --> 00:18:53.863
Immediately the moment
you shift to the left

00:18:53.887 --> 00:18:56.499
side, you swing to
an ego-oriented state,

00:18:56.544 --> 00:18:59.388
Now, a person who drinks alcohol,
how he speaks; you will be surprised;

00:19:01.055 --> 00:19:05.610
you move to the other side, and you become
so ego-oriented that it balances itself.

00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:12.337
The balance shifts from one side to another
as you keep swinging, and it increases.

00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:19.254
So the second thing is
consuming tobacco or any

00:19:19.278 --> 00:19:22.588
intoxicant; even taking sleeping tablets
are also harmful.

00:19:27.344 --> 00:19:29.899
I have specifically
mentioned these two things.

00:19:30.122 --> 00:19:34.388
The third thing is money; you
must be cautious about money;

00:19:35.033 --> 00:19:40.522
Too much focus on
money is also quite harmful,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.090
because when you chase after money,
you become distant from Lakshmi.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.639
And then you end
up looking for things

00:19:50.663 --> 00:19:55.001
like attending races
or playing cards,

00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:58.956
where you earn money in a competitive way.

00:19:59.312 --> 00:20:02.033
Once your focus is entangled
in money and then linked with

00:20:02.057 --> 00:20:04.778
entertainment, your entertainment
will never be satisfying.

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:08.523
Your mind will become
increasingly distressed,

00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:10.801
and you will get
stuck in that pit,

00:20:11.124 --> 00:20:13.657
making it difficult to escape,
and you won’t even realize it.

00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:15.566
I have seen elderly
women who are eighty,

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.590
ninety years old,
playing cards all the time,

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:21.279
foolish like playing cards all the
time; and they are worse than an ant.

00:20:22.835 --> 00:20:26.479
What is the use of a life where you
spend all your time playing cards?

00:20:27.345 --> 00:20:31.300
Such a life is completely condemnable.

00:20:31.679 --> 00:20:37.256
There is no use of such a life in the
world; where did God create such insects?

00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:42.216
It is astonishing! Eighty,
ninety-year-old women

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.500
sit and play cards,
that is called gambling.

00:20:47.211 --> 00:20:51.371
and they gamble with their money,
which is considered gambling.

00:20:51.462 --> 00:20:53.617
In any case, these three
things should never be a part

00:20:53.655 --> 00:20:55.840
of religion; even superficially,
if you try to do them,

00:20:56.411 --> 00:20:59.699
Then, the deeper aspects of
religion that I have mentioned to you,

00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:03.083
if you listen again,
they will explain that too.

00:21:03.322 --> 00:21:06.574
These were relevant in
their time, but these are

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:09.850
the basic things that a
person needs to adhere to.

00:21:10.522 --> 00:21:12.766
For such people, it is very
difficult to practice Sahaja

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.122
Yoga; that's why you know
that very few people come to us.

00:21:15.189 --> 00:21:17.411
Because Mother says,
"Don't do this, don't do that";

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:20.532
people want convenient gurus
who ask for a lot of money,

00:21:20.556 --> 00:21:23.299
saying, "Son, you do whatever
business you need to do."

00:21:24.433 --> 00:21:29.899
In an ego-oriented society,
the most settled thing is sex,

00:21:30.693 --> 00:21:33.301
and people keep falling
deeper into it, thinking

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:35.933
that if they have one
woman, they should have ten.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:38.888
They keep searching
everywhere; their attention,

00:21:39.053 --> 00:21:41.422
just like in cards
where it is on money,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.466
Alike it is constantly focused on women.

00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:48.518
Their eyes cannot stay focused;
they keep wandering aimlessly.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.023
such distracted and unstable mind
cannot be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:52.623 --> 00:21:54.245
First, one must establish self-respect;

00:21:54.455 --> 00:21:57.534
without self-respect,  
how can one's self-awareness awaken?

00:21:58.067 --> 00:22:00.555
Those who do not have
self-respect, who display

00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:03.067
their dignity in such a
way in front of everyone,

00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:11.867
this is a very subtle issue,

00:22:11.912 --> 00:22:13.245
which people do not understand;

00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:18.178
they get entangled in its subtle details,

00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:21.282
not realizing how it embeds
itself subtly into them.

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.934
But when the opportunity
arises he takes a stand,

00:22:24.201 --> 00:22:27.239
it suddenly emerges in the newspapers,
showing that Sahib seen at her

00:22:27.463 --> 00:22:30.178
place, that lady was seen at his
house; why, what benefit in that?

00:22:31.312 --> 00:22:33.556
I don’t understand what
pleasure they derive from it.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.201
I find no pleasure or
happiness in such people.

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:41.924
One should first establish
one's ideals; our ideals

00:22:41.948 --> 00:22:45.778
should be such that they
are consistent inside and out.

00:22:47.168 --> 00:22:48.834
This is not the case;
we have seen many

00:22:48.858 --> 00:22:50.923
people saying they
greatly respect Shastriji,

00:22:51.034 --> 00:22:54.367
I said good, but then we ask if anything
of his teachings is present in their lives.

00:22:54.568 --> 00:22:55.921
then how do you respect him?

00:22:55.945 --> 00:22:59.457
We greatly respect Gandhi ji, but we
don’t know his fundamental principles.

00:22:59.746 --> 00:23:02.856
If you respect their ideals,
then follow their ideals.

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:09.602
If you believe in their ideals,
then you should follow them.

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.212
If you just want to use their name,

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.945
So that you too should be
known that he is a great Gandian,

00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:17.932
then you are being
hypocritic. The moment your

00:23:18.755 --> 00:23:20.460
self respect with in
you is truly awakened,

00:23:20.511 --> 00:23:26.821
then only you would be
able to save your those ideals.

00:23:27.688 --> 00:23:29.220
and you can make them your own ideals.

00:23:29.244 --> 00:23:31.024
However there is no

00:23:31.048 --> 00:23:33.867
difference between an ordinary
person and an ideal person,

00:23:33.891 --> 00:23:36.710
no difference at all, An
ordinary person can achieve it,

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:41.266
it is not difficult at all,
especially for you people.

00:23:41.733 --> 00:23:44.612
You have gained so much
power, how many others have got it.

00:23:45.212 --> 00:23:48.345
But you should stand firm on your ideals;
There is no need to be ashamed of it;

00:23:48.533 --> 00:23:51.834
do not behave like the worldly
people. Live in your own way.

00:23:52.746 --> 00:23:57.878
In your own way, stand firm on your ideals,

00:23:58.233 --> 00:24:02.186
and hold on to your self-respect.
Speak openly about what you believe in,

00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:06.590
and the rest is all useless; and gradually,
the truth will reveal itself.

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:12.388
People will say, "What a man, completely
at peace!" He speaks exactly as he acts.

00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:18.434
There is no need to pretend, and
you will know that you are revered.

00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:24.990
Look at the wealthy and the
prominent; none of them are revered.

00:24:25.234 --> 00:24:27.545
People criticize them as
soon as they turn their backs.

00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:30.544
You become revered through your virtues.

00:24:30.568 --> 00:24:33.945
A person with virtues is the
only one who can develop them;

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:35.522
if you do not cultivate virtues;

00:24:35.723 --> 00:24:39.423
Then my shouting or the
awakening of your Kundalini will

00:24:39.447 --> 00:24:42.634
make no difference, as the
Kundalini will fall back down.

00:24:45.834 --> 00:24:48.256
I came here thinking I
wouldn’t say much today,

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.701
but my throat has gone
hoarse from speaking.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.056
Now, until you implement
something, my throat will not get better.

00:24:55.544 --> 00:24:59.232
It seems like you need to do
something. Sit in meditation daily.

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:03.344
Since I am here these days,
there are many vibrations.

00:25:04.188 --> 00:25:07.632
Until you absorb them up,
my health cannot improve.

00:25:10.455 --> 00:25:14.039
Dive deep, go deeper into
