00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:28.714
We are living in these modern times

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:31.699
which are very eventful

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:43.027
In last 50 or 60 years so many things have happened

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.240
and the churning should bring forth many truths before us

00:02:03.794 --> 00:02:13.826
First we have to realize that man has separated from each other.

00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:23.581
The relationships that existed once upon a time

00:02:24.703 --> 00:02:27.463
are no more to be found today.

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:41.467
And on the collective level we are waiting for a shock.

00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:51.853
God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall upon us.

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:02.649
Loudly. God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall.

00:03:02.674 --> 00:03:04.434
You can come here, better.

00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:18.414
And in these uncertain times only

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:26.983
we have to realize that there must some way out.

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:42.393
The way we understand through our mental projections,

00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:52.567
the solution is not in the view.

00:03:56.468 --> 00:04:02.828
The solution that we think is the solution becomes a bondage, a system.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.400
We try to break one system and build up another one

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.329
and that's how we find ourselves

00:04:19.354 --> 00:04:22.434
miserably caught up into these systems.

00:04:31.348 --> 00:04:37.948
So there has gone something wrong in our understanding of the problem.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.169
We have to little bit stand back

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:49.339
and see what mistake we must have committed.

00:04:56.609 --> 00:05:01.849
Once upon a time I came to Belgium on a ship,

00:05:01.874 --> 00:05:05.034
it was a very thriving shipping company.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:17.674
All that is showing us

00:05:17.874 --> 00:05:24.154
that even our economic enterprises come to a halt.

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:44.880
Now other enterprises on the emotional basis

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:56.162
or on the physical basis are giving us a feeling of confusion.

00:06:02.634 --> 00:06:06.474
Like today only a gentleman told me

00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:10.390
that allopathic medicines are rather dangerous.

00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:20.561
So I said: "What is the solution you have for it?"

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:26.554
The reason the cement is very dangerous

00:06:26.874 --> 00:06:30.754
because it retains lot of moisture.

00:06:37.294 --> 00:06:40.534
Then he said that the plastic is very dangerous ...

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:50.329
Ultimately it looked as if everything that we eat or live into

00:06:50.354 --> 00:06:52.274
seems to be a dangerous spot.

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:09.079
Now we should understand that the progress that we have made so far

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.196
is recoiling back upon ourselves.

00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:24.064
As if the progress was linear.

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:31.475
I went to Houston 10 years back nobody would look at you.

00:07:32.794 --> 00:07:36.714
Nobody would look at you, there were so rich you see.

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.994
Dynasty and all that, in Houston.

00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:50.756
And today they told me if anybody is willing to pay even the amount

00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:55.114
we have to pay to the bank we are willing to sell our houses.

00:08:04.654 --> 00:08:10.974
This ask for oil, oil, oil, oil, now they don't want oil.

00:08:17.154 --> 00:08:22.794
Then in the science we discovered atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb,

00:08:22.994 --> 00:08:24.794
all kinds of things.

00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:35.401
Then we have discovered our computers.

00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:43.211
And now we are worried that this computer will take over us.

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:52.508
Everything is getting out of control.

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:56.994
Where does the control lie?

00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:08.601
We talk of peace but how will you establish it?

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:13.765
There is a control within us.

00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:21.097
We can control everything.

00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:28.334
First we have to be in control with ourselves.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.940
First we have to know ourselves.

00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:42.408
And this feeling is very fashionable I should say.

00:09:47.254 --> 00:09:50.058
So many people are seeking the truth.

00:09:53.482 --> 00:09:58.242
Is a special quality of human beings who are seekers.

00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:09.119
And when they try to seek the idea goes to the market as usual.

00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:14.316
It goes to the market, the idea.

00:10:16.957 --> 00:10:23.397
So the demand is there for somebody to guide you in your seeking.

00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:32.681
So you have people who provide a kind of a market.

00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:39.681
You get so many money spinning gurus,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:50.970
they talk to you about peace and happiness and emancipation.

00:10:55.748 --> 00:10:57.868
But you have to pay.

00:10:59.474 --> 00:11:02.834
Today somebody told me in the car that the people who

00:11:03.034 --> 00:11:06.674
were telephoning asked how much do we have to pay.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.860
How much did you pay to Christ?

00:11:21.694 --> 00:11:26.134
How much are you going to pay for the love of God?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.800
Is nothing human that you can purchase it.

00:11:37.169 --> 00:11:40.209
The seekers if they realize one little point

00:11:40.234 --> 00:11:44.954
that you cannot pay for it, for your evolution you cannot pay.

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:50.274
That's one point, if you realize, half of the work is done.

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:07.089
The second point is that it is your evolution

00:12:07.114 --> 00:12:11.714
which is a living force, of living divine.

00:12:19.049 --> 00:12:23.969
This living force which has made you from amoeba stage

00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:27.874
to human being is going to make you something higher.

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:39.649
The living force that has created these beautiful flowers,

00:12:39.674 --> 00:12:42.474
how much did these flowers pay to that?

00:12:48.362 --> 00:12:54.242
How much did they pay for it? Or how much did they exert for it?

00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:01.399
So this evolution has to be spontaneous.

00:13:04.157 --> 00:13:07.397
Effortless.

00:13:08.838 --> 00:13:11.758
And that is what is Sahaja.

00:13:13.154 --> 00:13:17.234
'Saha' means 'with' and 'ja' means 'born with you'.

00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:27.965
It is born with you, the power.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.290
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:43.289
So every human being has a right to get to that state

00:13:43.314 --> 00:13:46.074
where you become one with the divine.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:14:00.160
We have heard about the all-pervading divine power.

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:09.809
Right from Lao Tse to Christ to Buddha,

00:14:09.834 --> 00:14:12.674
all of them have talked about it.

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:22.215
We did not know about the ether before.

00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:32.971
But we have heard about the Divine power, which is all-pervading.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:44.274
Once you are united with it, connected with it,

00:14:45.392 --> 00:14:53.392
then only you realize that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:15:00.809 --> 00:15:06.089
But before that it's only talk, talk of religion,

00:15:06.114 --> 00:15:09.994
talk about all philosophies, it's just a talk.

00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:21.574
Without any experience of this Divine power,

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:27.369
if we are going to believe into these talks and these dogmas

00:15:27.394 --> 00:15:30.594
also these mental projections

00:15:31.114 --> 00:15:35.674
we reach a state where we will say we don't believe in it.

00:15:46.517 --> 00:15:50.477
But this is not the way to know the Divine.

00:15:53.754 --> 00:15:58.634
In the Bible it is said that, "I will appear before you

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:00.634
like tongues of flames."

00:16:06.129 --> 00:16:09.889
In the Koran it is said that at the time of resurrection

00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:12.138
your hands will speak.

00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:22.529
You'll be surprised in the Koran, more chapters are dedicated

00:16:22.554 --> 00:16:27.154
to the resurrection time than to the doomsday.

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:41.951
They talk of the doomsday because that is how you frighten people.

00:16:46.332 --> 00:16:49.452
So this resurrection has to come first.

00:16:53.689 --> 00:16:58.689
Of course in all the Indian scriptures it is described

00:16:58.889 --> 00:17:05.129
that the only way to be in charge,

00:17:05.154 --> 00:17:09.874
to be in control yourself is through Self-realization.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.080
We do not know ourselves.

00:17:23.366 --> 00:17:28.126
People get cancer, they don't know they have cancer.

00:17:32.422 --> 00:17:37.222
People get mad, schizophrenic, they don't know they are mad.

00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:44.689
They don't know because they don't know their body,

00:17:44.714 --> 00:17:46.434
they don't know themselves.

00:17:51.052 --> 00:17:55.172
So to find out about ourselves we have to go inside.

00:18:00.284 --> 00:18:03.284
By going outside you cannot find out.

00:18:06.132 --> 00:18:08.252
How do you go inside?

00:18:10.124 --> 00:18:12.884
You are all paying attention to me.

00:18:12.914 --> 00:18:18.154
But if I say please pay attention to yourself, you'll say, "How?".

00:18:23.518 --> 00:18:26.278
You cannot take your attention inside.

00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:32.489
But you must know: the One who has made us

00:18:32.514 --> 00:18:35.794
has put all that in image within us.

00:18:39.889 --> 00:18:42.489
As the one who has made this instrument

00:18:42.514 --> 00:18:44.954
has also left the connection there.

00:18:49.288 --> 00:18:52.888
So it has just to be plugged to the mains, that's all.

00:18:55.829 --> 00:18:58.109
Then it works, fantastically.

00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:03.009
Only we are not connected to mains, that's all.

00:19:03.034 --> 00:19:05.794
There's nothing else to be done.

00:19:09.809 --> 00:19:12.369
Once you are connected to the mains

00:19:12.769 --> 00:19:16.529
you'll get all your physical benefits,

00:19:16.554 --> 00:19:22.085
mental benefits, emotional benefits and spiritual benefits.

00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:33.564
I'll tell you about the spiritual.

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:44.187
The spiritual benefit is that you get awakened to a new awareness.

00:19:49.385 --> 00:19:53.593
That on your central nervous system

00:19:53.634 --> 00:19:58.895
you can feel the collective consciousness.

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:12.787
That you can feel yourself and you can feel others within yourself.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.063
We have a force within us

00:20:23.074 --> 00:20:26.938
which is the power of pure desire.

00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:32.794
Is not an impure desire.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:41.209
As you know in economics it is said that the power, the

00:20:41.234 --> 00:20:47.169
satisfaction out of anything passes on from one to another.

00:20:47.194 --> 00:20:51.538
Like I want to buy a house then I want to buy a car

00:20:51.563 --> 00:20:53.633
then I want to buy that, I am never satisfied.

00:20:53.658 --> 00:20:56.428
So in general it is never satiable.

00:21:08.049 --> 00:21:14.969
But the pure desire within us is the desire to be one with the divine

00:21:14.994 --> 00:21:19.153
so that we get into the eternal life.

00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:30.546
This desire has to be awakened.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.225
Once it is awakened in this human awareness

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.610
you can feel on your central nervous system

00:21:48.954 --> 00:21:53.165
these centers that are within your body

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:59.404
which are subtle centers

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:09.885
and when they are in any way in trouble you get all these problems.

00:22:16.058 --> 00:22:20.615
You can feel them on your fingertips.

00:22:23.889 --> 00:22:27.529
It's something in English, to feel something on your fingertips,

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:29.183
means it is very easy.

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:37.489
So you feel it on your fingertips,

00:22:37.514 --> 00:22:40.834
your own centers which are in trouble.

00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:50.514
And you feel the centers of another person.

00:22:55.289 --> 00:22:59.809
Then if you know how to correct them

00:22:59.834 --> 00:23:03.555
in a very simple way, maybe just rubbing.

00:23:10.414 --> 00:23:12.614
And which are these centers.

00:23:14.524 --> 00:23:18.924
You can correct everything that is physical, mental and emotional.

00:23:24.754 --> 00:23:29.834
That's how you come in control of yourself, you control yourself.

00:23:33.814 --> 00:23:39.834
We are at a stage which I can describe you with an analogy.

00:23:44.633 --> 00:23:52.021
Like in the car you have got a brake and an accelerator.

00:23:55.489 --> 00:23:59.609
In that way in our body also there are two nadis, two systems,

00:23:59.634 --> 00:24:03.307
two channels, left and right which act

00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:06.794
as the brake and the accelerator.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.420
In the autonomous nervous system the left and the right sympathetic.

00:24:21.808 --> 00:24:25.953
The central part is for our evolution.

00:24:29.928 --> 00:24:36.049
So once we learn how to use the accelerator and also the brake

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:41.379
we become a driver. That means we come in the center.

00:24:50.096 --> 00:24:54.729
That means we become evolved enough to be

00:24:54.754 --> 00:24:57.074
automatically driving the car.

00:25:02.927 --> 00:25:07.101
But then there is the master sitting behind.

00:25:11.954 --> 00:25:15.674
Second stage you become the master.

00:25:19.444 --> 00:25:21.169
And you see the driver in you and

00:25:21.194 --> 00:25:26.922
you see the brake and the accelerator.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.704
And you are in charge.

00:25:37.228 --> 00:25:45.228
In the same way today I hope today many of you will become in charge.

00:25:51.135 --> 00:25:56.433
It is a very simple spontaneous matter.

00:26:01.049 --> 00:26:03.889
Like I would say if you have to put lights,

00:26:03.914 --> 00:26:05.969
so beautiful, so many beautiful lights

00:26:05.994 --> 00:26:10.394
you have to just put on one switch and then everything gets light.

00:26:14.783 --> 00:26:18.570
But behind that is a big history.

00:26:22.052 --> 00:26:25.410
Behind that there is a big organization.

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:29.849
I need not explain all that to you.

00:26:29.874 --> 00:26:33.153
It's better to put on the light first.

00:26:39.374 --> 00:26:41.752
And it has worked.

00:26:41.994 --> 00:26:46.934
Yesterday it worked and I am sure today it must work.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.505
And this has to take place in a very smooth manner.

00:27:05.923 --> 00:27:10.409
There are people who have read some books on Kundalini, I believe.

00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:18.553
First when I read them I was shocked.

00:27:21.584 --> 00:27:27.551
They are really absolutely against what is Kundalini awakening.

00:27:32.353 --> 00:27:35.833
They say it creates heat within you.

00:27:38.364 --> 00:27:40.767
They say that it burns you.

00:27:42.634 --> 00:27:44.314
Just the opposite.

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:50.209
The reason is those who are trying the Kundalini awakening

00:27:50.234 --> 00:27:51.994
are not authorized people.

00:27:59.575 --> 00:28:02.409
The one who doesn't understand about electricity

00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:05.634
and puts his hands in the plug will get a shock.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.560
You have to be authorized.

00:28:15.868 --> 00:28:18.541
These people have no authority.

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:22.915
It has to be a divine authority.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.049
A person who leads a life

00:28:27.074 --> 00:28:30.694
of taking money from others in the name of God

00:28:35.079 --> 00:28:36.829
is not a pure person at all.

00:28:38.797 --> 00:28:41.637
And moreover he has no self-respect.

00:28:44.409 --> 00:28:46.738
Or we can say he's a cheat.

00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:52.611
Such a horrid person, how can he raise the Kundalini?

00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:58.369
That's the purest form of energy,

00:28:58.394 --> 00:29:02.044
for that a person has to be a pure person.

00:29:07.177 --> 00:29:12.906
He talks to you about God and accumulates Rolls Royces.

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:16.914
It's nonsense.

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:20.369
But what happens to people I don't understand.

00:29:20.394 --> 00:29:24.834
That they accept such situations and such people as their leaders,

00:29:24.859 --> 00:29:27.111
who are cheats, who are fake.

00:29:34.165 --> 00:29:39.485
It's very agonizing, to see the way people accept them.

00:29:43.969 --> 00:29:49.969
You'll be amazed in 1970 I openly denounced all of them one by one

00:29:49.994 --> 00:29:53.605
and told them, "Be careful about these cheats."

00:30:00.143 --> 00:30:06.094
And I said it on a very big platform.

00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:13.209
People were very frightened and they said, "You shouldn't have said it,

00:30:13.234 --> 00:30:16.213
they will prosecute you or they will kill you".

00:30:20.158 --> 00:30:23.246
I said, "I'll have to see a person who can kill me".

00:30:26.627 --> 00:30:29.919
They have no courage because they are cheats.

00:30:33.209 --> 00:30:36.769
And they have cheated you people, you must understand this,

00:30:36.794 --> 00:30:41.009
that you cannot have a fake person to raise your Kundalini

00:30:41.034 --> 00:30:44.156
or to give your rebirth.

00:30:51.234 --> 00:30:55.584
Buddha has said that ignorance is the biggest curse.

00:30:59.969 --> 00:31:03.849
Though we have progressed very much outside, like a tree

00:31:03.874 --> 00:31:07.710
we are very ignorant about the roots, I think.

00:31:14.284 --> 00:31:17.729
And very beautiful people, seekers are lost

00:31:17.754 --> 00:31:22.234
because they did not know about the roots.

00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:33.142
In India we know the category of gurus.

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:41.209
Therein a guru who is called as Kuguru

00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:44.274
means who is not a guru but a bad man.

00:31:50.495 --> 00:31:54.218
And they are all out in the market, in the West.

00:31:57.002 --> 00:31:59.307
Because they can't exist in India.

00:32:01.638 --> 00:32:08.249
If they try to spread their ideas in India a farmer will say,

00:32:08.274 --> 00:32:10.994
"All right, you get lost. We know all this nonsense."

00:32:17.139 --> 00:32:20.455
We have had this absurd in the sixth century sometimes

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.534
but we have known all this, we have gone through all this.

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:36.353
Now, one has to realize that you have to become your own master.

00:32:41.017 --> 00:32:47.065
That is the sign of reality.

00:32:51.449 --> 00:32:55.529
So they say that there are gurus which are just called gurus

00:32:55.554 --> 00:32:59.569
but they are agurus, mean they are not gurus but they do the job

00:32:59.594 --> 00:33:03.449
like priests and all these people are not gurus but they do the job

00:33:03.474 --> 00:33:05.424
you see they are paid for it.

00:33:10.187 --> 00:33:16.467
But the sat guru is the one that makes you meet the Divine.

00:33:20.367 --> 00:33:25.409
That's the thing. So now what happens if your Kundalini is awakened.

00:33:25.434 --> 00:33:29.740
What happens when you get your realization, what should happen?

00:33:35.584 --> 00:33:40.169
When the disciples of Christ were blessed by Holy Ghost what happened?

00:33:40.194 --> 00:33:42.994
they felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:33:49.745 --> 00:33:54.769
They started the language, speaking the language of centers, chakras.

00:33:54.794 --> 00:33:58.908
And people thought they're speaking some Latin or Greek.

00:34:04.104 --> 00:34:10.909
If you become divine person you don't speak human languages do you?

00:34:15.565 --> 00:34:17.885
Then you speak divine language.

00:34:20.745 --> 00:34:27.504
And the divine language is the language of the chakras, the centers.

00:34:34.548 --> 00:34:38.267
The people thought they were mad.

00:34:40.893 --> 00:34:45.534
I mean if you go in the madhouse everybody thinks you are mad, isn't it.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.643
No use talking to the blind people about the colors.

00:34:56.002 --> 00:35:00.886
But here now we are to prove of the existence of God.

00:35:04.698 --> 00:35:08.034
And existence of this divine power.

00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:13.459
Existence of the divine laws.

00:35:15.893 --> 00:35:17.804
On your fingertips.

00:35:20.198 --> 00:35:25.252
The time has come, the blossom time has come

00:35:25.277 --> 00:35:28.729
so thousands have to become the fruit.

00:35:35.849 --> 00:35:38.249
The other day another gentleman just raised

00:35:38.274 --> 00:35:39.969
a question for nothing at all.

00:35:39.994 --> 00:35:41.554
That it is called as a serpent power.

00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:45.234
I mean I never called it, but somebody must have called it.

00:35:50.252 --> 00:35:54.994
Because I think in the West people are very allergic to the word serpent.

00:35:59.406 --> 00:36:07.006
But this energy is coiled into three and a half coils.

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:12.769
And in some people you can even see the pulsation,

00:36:12.794 --> 00:36:16.393
just like a heart on the triangular bone.

00:36:22.253 --> 00:36:27.109
When there is obstruction in the stomach on the solar plexus

00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:36.981
but it rises

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.675
it pierces through your fontanel bone area.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.077
And you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

00:36:54.698 --> 00:37:00.133
It's an experience which is just the beginning.

00:37:01.944 --> 00:37:06.144
Then you have to feel your own centers on your fingertips.

00:37:10.352 --> 00:37:14.178
This is the actualization of baptism.

00:37:20.009 --> 00:37:23.529
It's not something artificial, that you put some water

00:37:23.554 --> 00:37:26.580
on somebody's head and now you are baptized.

00:37:31.284 --> 00:37:35.348
And we accept it. We accept all these certificates we accept.

00:37:40.632 --> 00:37:47.547
William Blake writes, "A priest cursed me on my head",

00:37:57.643 --> 00:37:59.772
because he was a realized soul.

00:38:02.249 --> 00:38:05.489
We had so many realized souls but they could not

00:38:05.514 --> 00:38:07.394
convince people about it.

00:38:12.082 --> 00:38:14.803
At the most they were called as mad people.

00:38:17.103 --> 00:38:19.263
Nobody tried to understand.

00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:26.228
Doesn't matter. Now when we will know the truth,

00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:30.114
that we are the Spirit, that we are in charge.

00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:33.994
Then you will see for yourself that

00:38:34.194 --> 00:38:37.492
whatever all these great incarnations have said,

00:38:37.712 --> 00:38:41.659
all these prophets have said is the truth.

00:38:51.803 --> 00:38:55.430
We may say that is the knowledge of the roots.

00:38:57.969 --> 00:39:01.329
To know the knowledge of the roots we have to be

00:39:01.354 --> 00:39:03.714
at a subtler situation.

00:39:08.565 --> 00:39:11.485
We have to become a subtler personality.

00:39:13.969 --> 00:39:17.409
And when we become that subtler personality

00:39:17.434 --> 00:39:23.397
we know that we are collectively conscious.

00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:33.006
Truth must be experienced, one thing.

00:39:37.353 --> 00:39:40.793
And everybody must say that that is so.

00:39:42.575 --> 00:39:47.128
Like say you can say that I am wearing a red shawl all right.

00:39:51.231 --> 00:39:54.889
Everybody sees it's a red shawl.

00:39:54.994 --> 00:39:59.142
It is not that for some people it is green.

00:40:01.909 --> 00:40:05.474
In the same way truth should be universal.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:14.090
And truth should be expressed on our central nervous system.

00:40:18.827 --> 00:40:23.899
Like for a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

00:40:25.114 --> 00:40:30.634
Dog. For a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

00:40:35.656 --> 00:40:38.656
He cannot smell the filth.

00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:44.777
But he can feel a thief.

00:40:47.313 --> 00:40:52.873
But for a human being it is difficult to go through a dirty lane.

00:40:57.833 --> 00:41:00.418
But he can trust a thief.

00:41:01.994 --> 00:41:07.234
So the central nervous system is the one that tells you the truth.

00:41:11.129 --> 00:41:15.049
Our central nervous system as it is at the human level

00:41:15.074 --> 00:41:25.082
has to be enlightened by the Spirit.

00:41:26.874 --> 00:41:33.639
Lots of confusions there are already, I find, about the Spirit.

00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:40.274
Language problem.

00:41:40.634 --> 00:41:45.133
Like the Spirit could be dead body which is haunting

00:41:49.812 --> 00:41:54.394
or could be the Spirit, the Atma the reflection of God almighty.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.127
Or could be alcohol.

00:41:59.411 --> 00:42:01.689
Now which one I am talking about.

00:42:01.714 --> 00:42:05.231
It's the Spirit in your heart.

00:42:07.021 --> 00:42:11.741
Same about eternal life, there's a confusion I think.

00:42:16.049 --> 00:42:21.289
Some people think that if you die and become a ghost or a vampire,

00:42:21.314 --> 00:42:23.274
you have an eternal life.

00:42:27.598 --> 00:42:29.249
It is not.

00:42:29.274 --> 00:42:35.825
Eternal life is a life where you become the Spirit which is eternal.

00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:46.369
I must confess in this short time is not easy to explain everything

00:42:46.394 --> 00:42:49.306
about this ocean of knowledge.

00:42:57.438 --> 00:43:00.049
I must have given thousands of lectures before

00:43:00.074 --> 00:43:06.387
so I would apologize for not explaining everything

00:43:11.527 --> 00:43:14.601
but need not explain at all

00:43:16.354 --> 00:43:21.354
As I said that you have to just switch the button on and you get it.

00:43:23.975 --> 00:43:27.568
So why not have it.

00:43:27.594 --> 00:43:29.754
May God bless you.
