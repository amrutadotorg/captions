01:20.794 --> 01:28.714
We are living in these modern times

01:28.779 --> 01:31.699
which are very eventful

01:34.874 --> 01:43.027
In last 50 or 60 years so many things have happened

01:48.200 --> 01:56.240
and the churning should bring forth many truths before us

02:03.794 --> 02:13.826
First we have to realize that man has separated from each other.

02:20.461 --> 02:23.581
The relationships that existed once upon a time

02:24.703 --> 02:27.463
are no more to be found today.

02:33.907 --> 02:41.467
And on the collective level we are waiting for a shock.

02:46.853 --> 02:51.853
God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall upon us.

02:56.649 --> 03:02.649
Loudly. God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall.

03:02.674 --> 03:04.434
You can come here, better.

03:14.534 --> 03:18.414
And in these uncertain times only

03:20.863 --> 03:26.983
we have to realize that there must some way out.

03:37.193 --> 03:42.393
The way we understand through our mental projections,

03:48.487 --> 03:52.567
the solution is not in the view.

03:56.468 --> 04:02.828
The solution that we think is the solution becomes a bondage, a system.

04:08.920 --> 04:15.400
We try to break one system and build up another one

04:15.649 --> 04:19.329
and that's how we find ourselves

04:19.354 --> 04:22.434
miserably caught up into these systems.

04:31.348 --> 04:37.948
So there has gone something wrong in our understanding of the problem.

04:42.129 --> 04:45.169
We have to little bit stand back

04:45.194 --> 04:49.339
and see what mistake we must have committed.

04:56.609 --> 05:01.849
Once upon a time I came to Belgium on a ship,

05:01.874 --> 05:05.034
it was a very thriving shipping company.

05:13.514 --> 05:17.674
All that is showing us

05:17.874 --> 05:24.154
that even our economic enterprises come to a halt.

05:34.749 --> 05:44.880
Now other enterprises on the emotional basis

05:47.362 --> 05:56.162
or on the physical basis are giving us a feeling of confusion.

06:02.634 --> 06:06.474
Like today only a gentleman told me

06:06.744 --> 06:10.390
that allopathic medicines are rather dangerous.

06:17.441 --> 06:20.561
So I said: "What is the solution you have for it?"

06:23.434 --> 06:26.554
The reason the cement is very dangerous

06:26.874 --> 06:30.754
because it retains lot of moisture.

06:37.294 --> 06:40.534
Then he said that the plastic is very dangerous ...

06:44.849 --> 06:50.329
Ultimately it looked as if everything that we eat or live into

06:50.354 --> 06:52.274
seems to be a dangerous spot.

07:02.439 --> 07:09.079
Now we should understand that the progress that we have made so far

07:09.596 --> 07:12.196
is recoiling back upon ourselves.

07:21.304 --> 07:24.064
As if the progress was linear.

07:27.235 --> 07:31.475
I went to Houston 10 years back nobody would look at you.

07:32.794 --> 07:36.714
Nobody would look at you, there were so rich you see.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.994
Dynasty and all that, in Houston.

07:43.994 --> 07:50.756
And today they told me if anybody is willing to pay even the amount

07:50.781 --> 07:55.114
we have to pay to the bank we are willing to sell our houses.

08:04.654 --> 08:10.974
This ask for oil, oil, oil, oil, now they don't want oil.

08:17.154 --> 08:22.794
Then in the science we discovered atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb,

08:22.994 --> 08:24.794
all kinds of things.

08:30.561 --> 08:35.401
Then we have discovered our computers.

08:39.451 --> 08:43.211
And now we are worried that this computer will take over us.

08:50.028 --> 08:52.508
Everything is getting out of control.

08:54.474 --> 08:56.994
Where does the control lie?

09:01.481 --> 09:08.601
We talk of peace but how will you establish it?

09:10.765 --> 09:13.765
There is a control within us.

09:18.097 --> 09:21.097
We can control everything.

09:24.534 --> 09:28.334
First we have to be in control with ourselves.

09:31.980 --> 09:34.940
First we have to know ourselves.

09:37.208 --> 09:42.408
And this feeling is very fashionable I should say.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.058
So many people are seeking the truth.

09:53.482 --> 09:58.242
Is a special quality of human beings who are seekers.

10:02.359 --> 10:09.119
And when they try to seek the idea goes to the market as usual.

10:11.956 --> 10:14.316
It goes to the market, the idea.

10:16.957 --> 10:23.397
So the demand is there for somebody to guide you in your seeking.

10:26.601 --> 10:32.681
So you have people who provide a kind of a market.

10:36.561 --> 10:39.681
You get so many money spinning gurus,

10:42.690 --> 10:50.970
they talk to you about peace and happiness and emancipation.

10:55.748 --> 10:57.868
But you have to pay.

10:59.474 --> 11:02.834
Today somebody told me in the car that the people who

11:03.034 --> 11:06.674
were telephoning asked how much do we have to pay.

11:16.060 --> 11:18.860
How much did you pay to Christ?

11:21.694 --> 11:26.134
How much are you going to pay for the love of God?

11:28.560 --> 11:33.800
Is nothing human that you can purchase it.

11:37.169 --> 11:40.209
The seekers if they realize one little point

11:40.234 --> 11:44.954
that you cannot pay for it, for your evolution you cannot pay.

11:45.354 --> 11:50.274
That's one point, if you realize, half of the work is done.

12:02.569 --> 12:07.089
The second point is that it is your evolution

12:07.114 --> 12:11.714
which is a living force, of living divine.

12:19.049 --> 12:23.969
This living force which has made you from amoeba stage

12:23.994 --> 12:27.874
to human being is going to make you something higher.

12:35.929 --> 12:39.649
The living force that has created these beautiful flowers,

12:39.674 --> 12:42.474
how much did these flowers pay to that?

12:48.362 --> 12:54.242
How much did they pay for it? Or how much did they exert for it?

12:57.319 --> 13:01.399
So this evolution has to be spontaneous.

13:04.157 --> 13:07.397
Effortless.

13:08.838 --> 13:11.758
And that is what is Sahaja.

13:13.154 --> 13:17.234
'Saha' means 'with' and 'ja' means 'born with you'.

13:24.325 --> 13:27.965
It is born with you, the power.

13:30.890 --> 13:34.290
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

13:37.049 --> 13:43.289
So every human being has a right to get to that state

13:43.314 --> 13:46.074
where you become one with the divine.

13:54.480 --> 14:00.160
We have heard about the all-pervading divine power.

14:04.889 --> 14:09.809
Right from Lao Tse to Christ to Buddha,

14:09.834 --> 14:12.674
all of them have talked about it.

14:18.215 --> 14:22.215
We did not know about the ether before.

14:27.411 --> 14:32.971
But we have heard about the Divine power, which is all-pervading.

14:36.834 --> 14:44.274
Once you are united with it, connected with it,

14:45.392 --> 14:53.392
then only you realize that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

15:00.809 --> 15:06.089
But before that it's only talk, talk of religion,

15:06.114 --> 15:09.994
talk about all philosophies, it's just a talk.

15:16.694 --> 15:21.574
Without any experience of this Divine power,

15:21.889 --> 15:27.369
if we are going to believe into these talks and these dogmas

15:27.394 --> 15:30.594
also these mental projections

15:31.114 --> 15:35.674
we reach a state where we will say we don't believe in it.

15:46.517 --> 15:50.477
But this is not the way to know the Divine.

15:53.754 --> 15:58.634
In the Bible it is said that, "I will appear before you

15:58.834 --> 16:00.634
like tongues of flames."

16:06.129 --> 16:09.889
In the Koran it is said that at the time of resurrection

16:09.937 --> 16:12.138
your hands will speak.

16:17.289 --> 16:22.529
You'll be surprised in the Koran, more chapters are dedicated

16:22.554 --> 16:27.154
to the resurrection time than to the doomsday.

16:35.791 --> 16:41.951
They talk of the doomsday because that is how you frighten people.

16:46.332 --> 16:49.452
So this resurrection has to come first.

16:53.689 --> 16:58.689
Of course in all the Indian scriptures it is described

16:58.889 --> 17:05.129
that the only way to be in charge,

17:05.154 --> 17:09.874
to be in control yourself is through Self-realization.

17:18.320 --> 17:21.080
We do not know ourselves.

17:23.366 --> 17:28.126
People get cancer, they don't know they have cancer.

17:32.422 --> 17:37.222
People get mad, schizophrenic, they don't know they are mad.

17:42.049 --> 17:44.689
They don't know because they don't know their body,

17:44.714 --> 17:46.434
they don't know themselves.

17:51.052 --> 17:55.172
So to find out about ourselves we have to go inside.

18:00.284 --> 18:03.284
By going outside you cannot find out.

18:06.132 --> 18:08.252
How do you go inside?

18:10.124 --> 18:12.884
You are all paying attention to me.

18:12.914 --> 18:18.154
But if I say please pay attention to yourself, you'll say, "How?".

18:23.518 --> 18:26.278
You cannot take your attention inside.

18:28.689 --> 18:32.489
But you must know: the One who has made us

18:32.514 --> 18:35.794
has put all that in image within us.

18:39.889 --> 18:42.489
As the one who has made this instrument

18:42.514 --> 18:44.954
has also left the connection there.

18:49.288 --> 18:52.888
So it has just to be plugged to the mains, that's all.

18:55.829 --> 18:58.109
Then it works, fantastically.

18:59.649 --> 19:03.009
Only we are not connected to mains, that's all.

19:03.034 --> 19:05.794
There's nothing else to be done.

19:09.809 --> 19:12.369
Once you are connected to the mains

19:12.769 --> 19:16.529
you'll get all your physical benefits,

19:16.554 --> 19:22.085
mental benefits, emotional benefits and spiritual benefits.

19:30.595 --> 19:33.564
I'll tell you about the spiritual.

19:37.111 --> 19:44.187
The spiritual benefit is that you get awakened to a new awareness.

19:49.385 --> 19:53.593
That on your central nervous system

19:53.634 --> 19:58.895
you can feel the collective consciousness.

20:04.787 --> 20:12.787
That you can feel yourself and you can feel others within yourself.

20:18.610 --> 20:22.063
We have a force within us

20:23.074 --> 20:26.938
which is the power of pure desire.

20:29.605 --> 20:32.794
Is not an impure desire.

20:34.790 --> 20:41.209
As you know in economics it is said that the power, the

20:41.234 --> 20:47.169
satisfaction out of anything passes on from one to another.

20:47.194 --> 20:51.538
Like I want to buy a house then I want to buy a car

20:51.563 --> 20:53.633
then I want to buy that, I am never satisfied.

20:53.658 --> 20:56.428
So in general it is never satiable.

21:08.049 --> 21:14.969
But the pure desire within us is the desire to be one with the divine

21:14.994 --> 21:19.153
so that we get into the eternal life.

21:27.634 --> 21:30.546
This desire has to be awakened.

21:34.090 --> 21:38.225
Once it is awakened in this human awareness

21:38.690 --> 21:42.610
you can feel on your central nervous system

21:48.954 --> 21:53.165
these centers that are within your body

21:56.682 --> 21:59.404
which are subtle centers

22:01.270 --> 22:09.885
and when they are in any way in trouble you get all these problems.

22:16.058 --> 22:20.615
You can feel them on your fingertips.

22:23.889 --> 22:27.529
It's something in English, to feel something on your fingertips,

22:27.554 --> 22:29.183
means it is very easy.

22:34.809 --> 22:37.489
So you feel it on your fingertips,

22:37.514 --> 22:40.834
your own centers which are in trouble.

22:45.301 --> 22:50.514
And you feel the centers of another person.

22:55.289 --> 22:59.809
Then if you know how to correct them

22:59.834 --> 23:03.555
in a very simple way, maybe just rubbing.

23:10.414 --> 23:12.614
And which are these centers.

23:14.524 --> 23:18.924
You can correct everything that is physical, mental and emotional.

23:24.754 --> 23:29.834
That's how you come in control of yourself, you control yourself.

23:33.814 --> 23:39.834
We are at a stage which I can describe you with an analogy.

23:44.633 --> 23:52.021
Like in the car you have got a brake and an accelerator.

23:55.489 --> 23:59.609
In that way in our body also there are two nadis, two systems,

23:59.634 --> 24:03.307
two channels, left and right which act

24:03.382 --> 24:06.794
as the brake and the accelerator.

24:13.220 --> 24:17.420
In the autonomous nervous system the left and the right sympathetic.

24:21.808 --> 24:25.953
The central part is for our evolution.

24:29.928 --> 24:36.049
So once we learn how to use the accelerator and also the brake

24:36.074 --> 24:41.379
we become a driver. That means we come in the center.

24:50.096 --> 24:54.729
That means we become evolved enough to be

24:54.754 --> 24:57.074
automatically driving the car.

25:02.927 --> 25:07.101
But then there is the master sitting behind.

25:11.954 --> 25:15.674
Second stage you become the master.

25:19.444 --> 25:21.169
And you see the driver in you and

25:21.194 --> 25:26.922
you see the brake and the accelerator.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.704
And you are in charge.

25:37.228 --> 25:45.228
In the same way today I hope today many of you will become in charge.

25:51.135 --> 25:56.433
It is a very simple spontaneous matter.

26:01.049 --> 26:03.889
Like I would say if you have to put lights,

26:03.914 --> 26:05.969
so beautiful, so many beautiful lights

26:05.994 --> 26:10.394
you have to just put on one switch and then everything gets light.

26:14.783 --> 26:18.570
But behind that is a big history.

26:22.052 --> 26:25.410
Behind that there is a big organization.

26:27.529 --> 26:29.849
I need not explain all that to you.

26:29.874 --> 26:33.153
It's better to put on the light first.

26:39.374 --> 26:41.752
And it has worked.

26:41.994 --> 26:46.934
Yesterday it worked and I am sure today it must work.

26:54.160 --> 27:00.505
And this has to take place in a very smooth manner.

27:05.923 --> 27:10.409
There are people who have read some books on Kundalini, I believe.

27:15.288 --> 27:18.553
First when I read them I was shocked.

27:21.584 --> 27:27.551
They are really absolutely against what is Kundalini awakening.

27:32.353 --> 27:35.833
They say it creates heat within you.

27:38.364 --> 27:40.767
They say that it burns you.

27:42.634 --> 27:44.314
Just the opposite.

27:46.009 --> 27:50.209
The reason is those who are trying the Kundalini awakening

27:50.234 --> 27:51.994
are not authorized people.

27:59.575 --> 28:02.409
The one who doesn't understand about electricity

28:02.434 --> 28:05.634
and puts his hands in the plug will get a shock.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.560
You have to be authorized.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.541
These people have no authority.

28:20.759 --> 28:22.915
It has to be a divine authority.

28:25.110 --> 28:27.049
A person who leads a life

28:27.074 --> 28:30.694
of taking money from others in the name of God

28:35.079 --> 28:36.829
is not a pure person at all.

28:38.797 --> 28:41.637
And moreover he has no self-respect.

28:44.409 --> 28:46.738
Or we can say he's a cheat.

28:49.171 --> 28:52.611
Such a horrid person, how can he raise the Kundalini?

28:56.368 --> 28:58.369
That's the purest form of energy,

28:58.394 --> 29:02.044
for that a person has to be a pure person.

29:07.177 --> 29:12.906
He talks to you about God and accumulates Rolls Royces.

29:15.299 --> 29:16.914
It's nonsense.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.369
But what happens to people I don't understand.

29:20.394 --> 29:24.834
That they accept such situations and such people as their leaders,

29:24.859 --> 29:27.111
who are cheats, who are fake.

29:34.165 --> 29:39.485
It's very agonizing, to see the way people accept them.

29:43.969 --> 29:49.969
You'll be amazed in 1970 I openly denounced all of them one by one

29:49.994 --> 29:53.605
and told them, "Be careful about these cheats."

30:00.143 --> 30:06.094
And I said it on a very big platform.

30:09.862 --> 30:13.209
People were very frightened and they said, "You shouldn't have said it,

30:13.234 --> 30:16.213
they will prosecute you or they will kill you".

30:20.158 --> 30:23.246
I said, "I'll have to see a person who can kill me".

30:26.627 --> 30:29.919
They have no courage because they are cheats.

30:33.209 --> 30:36.769
And they have cheated you people, you must understand this,

30:36.794 --> 30:41.009
that you cannot have a fake person to raise your Kundalini

30:41.034 --> 30:44.156
or to give your rebirth.

30:51.234 --> 30:55.584
Buddha has said that ignorance is the biggest curse.

30:59.969 --> 31:03.849
Though we have progressed very much outside, like a tree

31:03.874 --> 31:07.710
we are very ignorant about the roots, I think.

31:14.284 --> 31:17.729
And very beautiful people, seekers are lost

31:17.754 --> 31:22.234
because they did not know about the roots.

31:28.006 --> 31:33.142
In India we know the category of gurus.

31:36.779 --> 31:41.209
Therein a guru who is called as Kuguru

31:41.234 --> 31:44.274
means who is not a guru but a bad man.

31:50.495 --> 31:54.218
And they are all out in the market, in the West.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.307
Because they can't exist in India.

32:01.638 --> 32:08.249
If they try to spread their ideas in India a farmer will say,

32:08.274 --> 32:10.994
"All right, you get lost. We know all this nonsense."

32:17.139 --> 32:20.455
We have had this absurd in the sixth century sometimes

32:20.480 --> 32:24.534
but we have known all this, we have gone through all this.

32:29.247 --> 32:36.353
Now, one has to realize that you have to become your own master.

32:41.017 --> 32:47.065
That is the sign of reality.

32:51.449 --> 32:55.529
So they say that there are gurus which are just called gurus

32:55.554 --> 32:59.569
but they are agurus, mean they are not gurus but they do the job

32:59.594 --> 33:03.449
like priests and all these people are not gurus but they do the job

33:03.474 --> 33:05.424
you see they are paid for it.

33:10.187 --> 33:16.467
But the sat guru is the one that makes you meet the Divine.

33:20.367 --> 33:25.409
That's the thing. So now what happens if your Kundalini is awakened.

33:25.434 --> 33:29.740
What happens when you get your realization, what should happen?

33:35.584 --> 33:40.169
When the disciples of Christ were blessed by Holy Ghost what happened?

33:40.194 --> 33:42.994
they felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

33:49.745 --> 33:54.769
They started the language, speaking the language of centers, chakras.

33:54.794 --> 33:58.908
And people thought they're speaking some Latin or Greek.

34:04.104 --> 34:10.909
If you become divine person you don't speak human languages do you?

34:15.565 --> 34:17.885
Then you speak divine language.

34:20.745 --> 34:27.504
And the divine language is the language of the chakras, the centers.

34:34.548 --> 34:38.267
The people thought they were mad.

34:40.893 --> 34:45.534
I mean if you go in the madhouse everybody thinks you are mad, isn't it.

34:49.210 --> 34:52.643
No use talking to the blind people about the colors.

34:56.002 --> 35:00.886
But here now we are to prove of the existence of God.

35:04.698 --> 35:08.034
And existence of this divine power.

35:09.982 --> 35:13.459
Existence of the divine laws.

35:15.893 --> 35:17.804
On your fingertips.

35:20.198 --> 35:25.252
The time has come, the blossom time has come

35:25.277 --> 35:28.729
so thousands have to become the fruit.

35:35.849 --> 35:38.249
The other day another gentleman just raised

35:38.274 --> 35:39.969
a question for nothing at all.

35:39.994 --> 35:41.554
That it is called as a serpent power.

35:41.579 --> 35:45.234
I mean I never called it, but somebody must have called it.

35:50.252 --> 35:54.994
Because I think in the West people are very allergic to the word serpent.

35:59.406 --> 36:07.006
But this energy is coiled into three and a half coils.

36:08.369 --> 36:12.769
And in some people you can even see the pulsation,

36:12.794 --> 36:16.393
just like a heart on the triangular bone.

36:22.253 --> 36:27.109
When there is obstruction in the stomach on the solar plexus

36:31.231 --> 36:36.981
but it rises

36:38.950 --> 36:41.675
it pierces through your fontanel bone area.

36:44.260 --> 36:49.077
And you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

36:54.698 --> 37:00.133
It's an experience which is just the beginning.

37:01.944 --> 37:06.144
Then you have to feel your own centers on your fingertips.

37:10.352 --> 37:14.178
This is the actualization of baptism.

37:20.009 --> 37:23.529
It's not something artificial, that you put some water

37:23.554 --> 37:26.580
on somebody's head and now you are baptized.

37:31.284 --> 37:35.348
And we accept it. We accept all these certificates we accept.

37:40.632 --> 37:47.547
William Blake writes, "A priest cursed me on my head",

37:57.643 --> 37:59.772
because he was a realized soul.

38:02.249 --> 38:05.489
We had so many realized souls but they could not

38:05.514 --> 38:07.394
convince people about it.

38:12.082 --> 38:14.803
At the most they were called as mad people.

38:17.103 --> 38:19.263
Nobody tried to understand.

38:20.865 --> 38:26.228
Doesn't matter. Now when we will know the truth,

38:26.253 --> 38:30.114
that we are the Spirit, that we are in charge.

38:30.554 --> 38:33.994
Then you will see for yourself that

38:34.194 --> 38:37.492
whatever all these great incarnations have said,

38:37.712 --> 38:41.659
all these prophets have said is the truth.

38:51.803 --> 38:55.430
We may say that is the knowledge of the roots.

38:57.969 --> 39:01.329
To know the knowledge of the roots we have to be

39:01.354 --> 39:03.714
at a subtler situation.

39:08.565 --> 39:11.485
We have to become a subtler personality.

39:13.969 --> 39:17.409
And when we become that subtler personality

39:17.434 --> 39:23.397
we know that we are collectively conscious.

39:29.521 --> 39:33.006
Truth must be experienced, one thing.

39:37.353 --> 39:40.793
And everybody must say that that is so.

39:42.575 --> 39:47.128
Like say you can say that I am wearing a red shawl all right.

39:51.231 --> 39:54.889
Everybody sees it's a red shawl.

39:54.994 --> 39:59.142
It is not that for some people it is green.

40:01.909 --> 40:05.474
In the same way truth should be universal.

40:09.650 --> 40:14.090
And truth should be expressed on our central nervous system.

40:18.827 --> 40:23.899
Like for a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

40:25.114 --> 40:30.634
Dog. For a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

40:35.656 --> 40:38.656
He cannot smell the filth.

40:41.991 --> 40:44.777
But he can feel a thief.

40:47.313 --> 40:52.873
But for a human being it is difficult to go through a dirty lane.

40:57.833 --> 41:00.418
But he can trust a thief.

41:01.994 --> 41:07.234
So the central nervous system is the one that tells you the truth.

41:11.129 --> 41:15.049
Our central nervous system as it is at the human level

41:15.074 --> 41:25.082
has to be enlightened by the Spirit.

41:26.874 --> 41:33.639
Lots of confusions there are already, I find, about the Spirit.

41:37.834 --> 41:40.274
Language problem.

41:40.634 --> 41:45.133
Like the Spirit could be dead body which is haunting

41:49.812 --> 41:54.394
or could be the Spirit, the Atma the reflection of God almighty.

41:56.510 --> 41:58.127
Or could be alcohol.

41:59.411 --> 42:01.689
Now which one I am talking about.

42:01.714 --> 42:05.231
It's the Spirit in your heart.

42:07.021 --> 42:11.741
Same about eternal life, there's a confusion I think.

42:16.049 --> 42:21.289
Some people think that if you die and become a ghost or a vampire,

42:21.314 --> 42:23.274
you have an eternal life.

42:27.598 --> 42:29.249
It is not.

42:29.274 --> 42:35.825
Eternal life is a life where you become the Spirit which is eternal.

42:40.689 --> 42:46.369
I must confess in this short time is not easy to explain everything

42:46.394 --> 42:49.306
about this ocean of knowledge.

42:57.438 --> 43:00.049
I must have given thousands of lectures before

43:00.074 --> 43:06.387
so I would apologize for not explaining everything

43:11.527 --> 43:14.601
but need not explain at all

43:16.354 --> 43:21.354
As I said that you have to just switch the button on and you get it.

43:23.975 --> 43:27.568
So why not have it.

43:27.594 --> 43:29.754
May God bless you.
