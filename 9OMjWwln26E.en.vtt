00:02.320 --> 00:06.040
Sahasrara Puja, "How it was decided". Fregene (Italy), 8 May 1988.

01:50.560 --> 01:56.600
Today is the nineteenth Sahasrara Day.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.400
If you count the first one the day the Sahasrara was opened.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.120
I'll have to tell..

02:07.560 --> 02:10.520
I'll have to tell you the story

02:12.240 --> 02:13.920
about the Sahasrara day,

02:15.520 --> 02:21.200
about which it was decided, long time back,

02:25.040 --> 02:27.640
before I incarnated.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.360
They had a big meeting in the heavens,

02:39.840 --> 02:45.800
all the thirty-five crores (350 million)

02:46.920 --> 02:53.480
of Gods, the deities were there present

02:57.600 --> 03:01.520
to decide what is to be done.

03:02.640 --> 03:08.520
This is the ultimate that we have to give to human beings,

03:09.680 --> 03:14.440
is to open their Sahasrara;

03:14.760 --> 03:20.760
to open their awareness to the Spirit;

03:25.600 --> 03:31.680
to the real knowledge of the Divine.

03:33.400 --> 03:39.600
To remove the darkness of ignorance,

03:44.240 --> 03:47.880
and it had to be spontaneously,

03:48.400 --> 03:53.320
because it has to work - the living force of God.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.840
Also it had to be very quick.

04:00.800 --> 04:04.640
So all the Gods requested that now,

04:04.880 --> 04:07.960
I, the Adi Shakti, has to take the birth.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.400
They all tried their best.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.680
They did whatever was possible,

04:18.080 --> 04:24.240
the saints were made by them, but very few.

04:27.080 --> 04:32.360
They incarnated and people made religions out of them

04:32.640 --> 04:37.760
which were perverted - brought them bad name.

04:38.760 --> 04:42.080
No reality in those religions.

04:43.840 --> 04:48.200
These religions were money oriented

04:49.480 --> 04:51.840
or power oriented.

04:52.680 --> 04:58.320
There was no Divine force working, actually it was all anti-divine.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.480
How to now turn human beings

05:08.280 --> 05:12.640
away from these superficial religions,

05:13.680 --> 05:18.680
these perverted paths of destruction.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.520
How to tell them about all these established organisations.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.960
For ages they have been ruling,

05:29.200 --> 05:31.600
making money, making power.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.960
It was a tremendous task,

05:40.200 --> 05:46.080
had to be done with great patience and the love.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.360
It was a very delicate work also,

05:51.360 --> 05:53.680
because they believed in those religions,

05:53.880 --> 05:56.400
innocent people, simple people.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.520
To blast them that this is all nonsense,

06:00.600 --> 06:03.080
UNCLEAR (they/there) are no religions,

06:03.160 --> 06:07.240
they are against incarnations, against all the prophets,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.960
against all the saints.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.840
That's why all the real saints had to suffer.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.800
It's a powerful work that was to be done,

06:20.080 --> 06:24.200
and that's why Adi Shakti had to take birth on this earth.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.760
It had to be before the sixth of May

06:31.920 --> 06:37.920
because sixth of May was the doomsday in that year.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.280
It was done on the fifth of May at the nick of time.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.440
It was all decided beforehand,

06:52.800 --> 06:56.960
and every deity's job was allotted to all of them.

06:59.480 --> 07:04.080
Very efficient deities, very obedient,

07:05.920 --> 07:08.920
they knew me very well.

07:10.320 --> 07:13.840
Completely dedicated and devoted.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.240
They knew me very very well,

07:19.480 --> 07:23.360
every end of my hair, they knew.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.320
I didn't have to teach them protocol,

07:30.480 --> 07:33.960
love itself gives you protocol

07:35.200 --> 07:39.160
but love that is Divine, is not selfish love.

07:39.640 --> 07:44.320
It's not the way we love my child, my husband,

07:44.800 --> 07:48.520
my country, my clothes.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.360
It is the love

07:55.200 --> 07:57.080
which is Divine,

08:00.880 --> 08:06.800
which spreads from your heart,

08:07.840 --> 08:09.560
from your Spirit,

08:09.920 --> 08:15.640
like the light of knowledge.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.800
What a tremendous task it was.

08:23.560 --> 08:27.200
So I said, at Sahasrara

08:27.480 --> 08:29.920
I had to be Mahamaya.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.880
I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be something

08:38.360 --> 08:41.200
that people can't recognise me easily.

08:41.920 --> 08:45.560
But deities know!

08:46.640 --> 08:49.680
This Mahamaya had to come on this earth,

08:50.320 --> 08:55.520
not the Adi Shakti in her purest form, it's too much.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.840
So she was covered with this Mahamaya.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.320
Now you see,

09:10.520 --> 09:14.520
in nineteen years what we have achieved.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.760
So many yogis are sitting before me.

09:22.920 --> 09:26.680
The difference between

09:27.120 --> 09:31.480
a saint and a yogi is

09:32.920 --> 09:37.200
that a saint himself is righteous,

09:38.840 --> 09:42.600
himself is holy,

09:45.320 --> 09:51.480
but he doesn't know much about the Kundalini.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.200
But the yogi knows about the Kundalini.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.680
But the difference between a yogi and a Sahaja Yogini -

10:05.280 --> 10:10.400
Sahaja Yogi, is that a Sahaja Yogi has powers.

10:11.400 --> 10:16.400
A Sahaja Yogini has powers to give realisation to others.

10:19.320 --> 10:24.520
A yogi can cleanse himself but he cannot cleanse others,

10:27.040 --> 10:32.840
while a Sahaja Yogi can cleanse others and cleanse himself.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.320
So this is the superior most state

10:38.080 --> 10:42.480
which you achieved through your

10:43.520 --> 10:45.760
great punyas I should say.

10:46.560 --> 10:51.080
So many of you have been searching the truth in previous lives,

10:51.520 --> 10:57.440
and now here you are to achieve

10:57.760 --> 11:00.480
what you have been searching for.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.320
All that has happened now, so beautifully.

11:07.320 --> 11:10.400
You are not even aware what has happened to you.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.360
Automatically,

11:14.240 --> 11:16.920
spontaneously you have got the powers

11:17.360 --> 11:22.120
within your central nervous system in a split of a second.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.200
Your attention has been fixed now.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.080
Of course even now some people don't have.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.280
Even now I see the attention wobbles.

11:40.320 --> 11:45.520
But so many of you have achieved that state as he was saying,

11:45.800 --> 11:49.400
Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham. You have it.

11:51.040 --> 11:54.360
What Adi Shankaracharya has described about himself,

11:54.680 --> 11:59.680
you can say that about all of you.

12:00.400 --> 12:04.640
So many Adi Shankaracharyas sitting before Me.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.920
But still I am a Mahamaya.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.600
I just behave like you,

12:16.800 --> 12:19.520
I too have a family,

12:21.800 --> 12:25.840
I too have children which can be called as mine,

12:27.040 --> 12:29.400
and you are my children too.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.320
So when you are mature enough

12:35.320 --> 12:39.640
the first sign is that you get discretion.

12:40.640 --> 12:45.160
That Divine discretion is love, again.

12:45.840 --> 12:51.280
But I see people falter. They don't mind saying

12:51.600 --> 12:54.800
"Mother, I am catching on my Agnya."

12:55.760 --> 12:59.600
Why? You know how to cleanse it.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.680
You know what to do about it.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.280
Why don't you clear it? Why don't you get to it?

13:07.920 --> 13:10.600
What is the thing? The Maya.

13:11.880 --> 13:16.040
First starts

13:17.320 --> 13:20.080
the problem of family.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.080
My wife, my mother, my brother,

13:24.480 --> 13:28.800
my husband, my children, all right.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.000
That's Maya.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.040
With that you get drowned.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.400
Again you are brought up.

13:43.600 --> 13:47.520
Then subtler and subtler this Maya becomes.

13:49.240 --> 13:54.040
The situation of the family improves, everybody knows that.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.680
But so many falter,

13:57.160 --> 13:58.920
so many get lost

13:59.360 --> 14:02.920
in Sahaja Yoga because they had a bad wife or a bad husband.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.040
You have to ascend alone, yourself.

14:10.680 --> 14:13.680
You don't have to depend on others.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.880
And those who do not allow you to ascend have to be thrown away.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.840
Nothing is more important than your ascent;

14:27.120 --> 14:32.280
higher and higher, because it has a very great Divine purpose.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.080
The ultimate, the climax

14:36.800 --> 14:41.440
where the whole humanity is to be saved through your efforts.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.400
You have to work it out.

14:50.920 --> 14:56.240
And at this situation we see the thousand petals.

14:59.760 --> 15:05.040
These are the powers of Virata within you.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.320
And this is where we falter,

15:09.760 --> 15:13.320
that the light of the Sahasrara

15:13.600 --> 15:19.600
is the Brahmarandhra, which is your heart chakra.

15:22.080 --> 15:26.840
Now the heart chakra can be also misunderstood, very much.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.840
And this misunderstanding always comes

15:31.120 --> 15:34.920
from the Mahamaya, for testing.

15:36.240 --> 15:42.320
Like we have, say, we have to have a family.

15:43.640 --> 15:48.480
We must have good families, we must have good children.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.160
Immediately the Mahamaya acts.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.960
We start worrying about the husband, worrying about the family.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.680
We should be your family.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.680
There's a saying in Sanskrit:

16:06.000 --> 16:09.200
”Udāracharitānām vasudhaiva vasu kutumbakam”

16:09.520 --> 16:14.840
the one who are of a character of saints,

16:15.240 --> 16:18.920
the whole world is their family.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.800
You worry about an individual family

16:26.120 --> 16:29.200
so that the collective family is strengthened,

16:29.520 --> 16:33.400
not to worry about individual families,

16:33.680 --> 16:37.440
so that the collective suffers.

16:39.520 --> 16:44.400
And if there is such a family tie, better throw it away.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.440
We have to sacrifice.

16:47.880 --> 16:52.840
No sacrifice, it's only getting rid of the disease.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.720
So we waste our time with our children,

16:59.520 --> 17:04.640
with our family, which is very small.

17:07.120 --> 17:12.920
Then the situation changes in different areas,

17:13.840 --> 17:19.200
that's the compassion,

17:19.520 --> 17:21.760
the love and affection.

17:24.320 --> 17:28.760
We believe that we have to love Sahaja Yogis.

17:34.640 --> 17:39.640
I asked somebody to go away,

17:41.760 --> 17:45.600
because he had a disease and he told me lies.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.120
So a negative person's attention will go to him more,

17:54.760 --> 17:58.520
and will try to look after that person more

17:59.600 --> 18:02.600
than to other Sahaja Yogis.

18:04.520 --> 18:09.400
Do you have more compassion and love than I have?

18:11.920 --> 18:18.040
Why do you get attracted to people who are out of Sahaja Yoga?

18:19.920 --> 18:23.320
Why do you sympathise with people

18:24.680 --> 18:27.120
who are like this.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.200
You are not here to help

18:31.520 --> 18:35.400
the downtrodden, the poor,

18:36.320 --> 18:38.640
the so called suffering people.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.160
No, you are not incarnations.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.080
You are not here to help women

18:49.320 --> 18:51.920
who are crying all the time,

18:52.320 --> 18:57.000
and to children who had to be separated from their parents.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.240
It's a hospital that we are in.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.920
We are getting cured all of us.

19:05.320 --> 19:10.360
Have you heard of a patient going and helping other patients?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.760
It's the doctors that have to do the job.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.440
But Sahaja Yogis always, in the beginning,

19:19.680 --> 19:24.480
used to fall a prey to this kind of an appeal;

19:28.040 --> 19:32.680
like a bad apple, and there are many good apples.

19:33.320 --> 19:37.520
How can the good apples cure the bad apple, can they?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.480
Even if you put

19:42.760 --> 19:46.800
twenty thousand on top of that bad apple it will spoil all others.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.120
That's not your job, that's the job of God.

19:53.320 --> 19:59.240
Only thing what you can do is to pull that person

19:59.600 --> 20:01.600
in the collectivity showing that

20:01.840 --> 20:03.840
you are wrong, you are wrong, you are wrong -

20:04.480 --> 20:07.440
and you have to be all right.

20:08.160 --> 20:12.120
But these ideas, I don't know from where they have crawled,

20:12.400 --> 20:15.320
that there's nothing like evil in this world.

20:16.160 --> 20:20.200
There's nothing like bad in this world. There is evil,

20:22.640 --> 20:25.040
there is something bad.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.480
And you can know, if your vibrations are correct,

20:28.680 --> 20:31.760
your discretion is correct you'll know immediately.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.640
So you waste your energies in correcting people

20:35.920 --> 20:38.840
who can never, never be corrected,

20:39.600 --> 20:42.320
and forgetting that you have not corrected the person,

20:42.600 --> 20:45.720
on the contrary you are corrupted.

20:50.320 --> 20:54.320
That means that you are not yet matured enough.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.400
In the breaking of the Sahasrara

21:01.320 --> 21:05.640
I have never left anything undone, it's a perfect job.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.040
Your nerves are not hurt. Your brain is not hurt.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.760
Such a powerful Kundalini comes up.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.920
How sweetly, beautifully, delicately she pierces through.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.440
Only a thread comes out.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.320
And how then the connection is established

21:27.640 --> 21:31.400
and the relaxation starts coming in on the sympathetic.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.760
How all the beautifully all the chakras open

21:35.160 --> 21:37.920
and more of these threads are coming up.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.680
Now you are also told how to work it out.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.480
You know all the technical know-how.

21:45.800 --> 21:50.320
What you don't know, that you are not yet a perfect machine.

21:51.120 --> 21:56.400
You have to perfect yourself, moreover there's a Mahamaya.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
She doesn't take you for granted, that's the trouble.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.960
She puts you deliberately into temptations.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.040
Deliberately she gives you positions.

22:10.320 --> 22:15.200
Now leaders, world leaders, universe leaders.

22:19.960 --> 22:26.400
and so - you develop first one tail, then one horn,

22:28.240 --> 22:32.080
and then something comes out of Sahasrara also.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.240
Look like a clown.

22:38.920 --> 22:42.320
To test you she may marry you to funny people also.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.520
This testing has to be done.

22:47.240 --> 22:51.400
That's the job of a Mahamaya. She has to test you.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.120
Gold has to be tested.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.440
The diamond has to be tested.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.040
All that is valuable has to be tested.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.400
Without that how can you certify.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.200
It's not like going to the church.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.920
Somebody puts the water on your head, all right,

23:09.160 --> 23:14.120
now you are baptised. Finished, now you are chosen.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.280
The water will evaporate in no time.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.960
And when you will go to God he'll say

23:22.360 --> 23:24.120
"How are you baptised?", "This water",

23:24.600 --> 23:26.880
"Where is it? I can't see it."

23:32.520 --> 23:36.320
So all these things are to be understood in right perspective.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.280
They are for our ascent.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.960
For our benevolence. For our higher state.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.440
But for that,

23:49.040 --> 23:53.520
you must know, we have to fix up

23:54.640 --> 23:57.520
our whole will to it.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.960
When people climb, say, Himalayas.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.560
What do they do?

24:04.240 --> 24:08.120
They take a big nail, nail it at a higher point,

24:08.760 --> 24:12.680
then tie up a rope and climb up to that.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.920
They don't look down.

24:15.200 --> 24:20.400
Then put another nail up there, climb up to that.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.760
And that's how they climb Himalayas.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.640
Now what do we do in Sahaja Yoga, we take a nail

24:31.920 --> 24:35.080
from the top, put it downward.

24:36.880 --> 24:41.080
First day when you get realisation the experience is tremendous.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.520
Then one by one coming down, the other way round.

24:47.240 --> 24:52.440
But as soon as you get realisation, if you are intelligent enough,

24:53.160 --> 24:58.000
then you decide; "How should I fix up myself?"

24:59.320 --> 25:05.200
Like, decide like this:

25:05.400 --> 25:09.000
Supposing you are very fond of milk, take it like this.

25:10.040 --> 25:14.400
Now you should say "Till I achieve a certain state

25:14.760 --> 25:16.920
I'll not take milk."

25:18.520 --> 25:21.200
But that should not be treated as a sacrifice

25:21.480 --> 25:23.840
but as a joyous ascent.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.160
Do the people who nail upwards to go to

25:30.640 --> 25:32.320
the top of the Himalayas,

25:32.560 --> 25:35.240
do they feel they are sacrificing something.

25:38.200 --> 25:43.560
If you start thinking that "Oh God I have sacrificed milk."

25:45.040 --> 25:48.440
Then you're finished. Downward movement starts.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.840
But if you like something,

25:54.080 --> 25:56.640
then you have to say "all right if I like it,

25:57.200 --> 26:00.440
let me like my ascent more than this.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.880
Till I have ascended I will not have."

26:04.760 --> 26:08.160
Such determination should be there.

26:09.680 --> 26:13.280
And without that how do you think

26:14.120 --> 26:17.600
you can get over the horrible,

26:17.920 --> 26:23.680
monstrous mountain of ignorance that you have got?

26:25.960 --> 26:30.440
Actually, in realisation I have put you on the top of the mountain.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.760
But you start slipping down.

26:34.200 --> 26:39.800
So you have to keep to that topmost point.

26:41.760 --> 26:47.640
I tell you about everything.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.680
You go and ask anyone of the saints or

26:51.960 --> 26:57.200
anyone of the great incarnations,

26:58.200 --> 27:01.480
did they know so much about Kundalini.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.240
If they had they would have written about it.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.200
They have never written anything about Kundalini.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.480
If they have it's very little.

27:16.840 --> 27:20.120
To such an extent that it acts on your fingertips.

27:20.800 --> 27:26.600
That now we have brought science

27:28.240 --> 27:32.160
close to reality,

27:33.600 --> 27:39.320
the truth, the Divine science,

27:39.760 --> 27:41.200
all explained.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.320
It's become completely integrated now with us.

27:45.640 --> 27:49.320
Sahaja Yoga is the most scientific thing

27:49.600 --> 27:52.520
that you could think of, exact.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.400
The biggest computer that you are,

27:57.080 --> 28:00.520
but the computer has to be workable.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.120
And there's why we have failed.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.280
And we fail every day.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.680
Sometimes it is disastrous, horrible.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.240
Now nineteen years we have had the Sahasrara,

28:22.920 --> 28:26.520
and eighteen years I have worked.

28:31.800 --> 28:37.800
You have to now understand your responsibility.

28:40.320 --> 28:45.320
We have to emancipate the human beings.

28:46.520 --> 28:52.320
We don't want to do anything

28:54.120 --> 28:57.320
that is a little out the way.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.600
Now Sahasrara day is on the fifth,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.480
but we must celebrate today

29:02.760 --> 29:06.680
because everybody must have a Sunday holiday.

29:07.520 --> 29:12.240
According to our conveniences, we have to work out everything.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.600
All right, doesn't matter. It's permitted.

29:16.320 --> 29:22.240
The deities, they are working twenty-four hours,

29:25.000 --> 29:31.200
all the months and all the years now, continuously.

29:33.760 --> 29:37.960
Because they have a continuous supply of energy,

29:38.320 --> 29:41.000
which you can also have.

29:41.720 --> 29:46.600
The importance given to your ascent

29:47.480 --> 29:50.320
is very little, I think,

29:50.920 --> 29:55.400
compared to the growth of eighteen years.

29:56.640 --> 30:00.680
You know in the western countries, after eighteen years

30:01.040 --> 30:05.680
you are regarded as adults, no more children,

30:07.600 --> 30:10.200
you all have become now adults.

30:10.840 --> 30:16.320
Adults, all right, but I don't know how far you have grown.

30:17.720 --> 30:22.200
I don't know really, you are still big babies,

30:22.240 --> 30:27.400
or you have really achieved that state of adulthood.

30:28.040 --> 30:32.080
And there, at that time, you are given lots of

30:33.600 --> 30:37.440
concessions and freedoms and rights.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.960
You have already all rights:

30:42.320 --> 30:44.360
if you want to go to heaven you can go,

30:44.400 --> 30:46.480
if you want to go to hell you can go,

30:46.520 --> 30:50.560
all freedom, no problem on that.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.960
But the adults are those who have discretion,

30:55.240 --> 30:59.080
who know what is the purpose of their life,

31:00.080 --> 31:03.280
who can do anything to achieve that purpose,

31:03.800 --> 31:08.160
who have powers to fight and understand.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.240
While I find people who are even grown up people

31:12.520 --> 31:17.000
in Sahaja Yoga, behave in such a manner.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.040
that you're surprised, how do you get impressed

31:20.240 --> 31:23.640
by superficial people, by superficiality.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.120
If somebody is very sweet to talk,

31:26.400 --> 31:31.600
doesn't mean that person is good, that person is Divine, does it?

31:32.240 --> 31:36.600
On the contrary a Divine person is never that sweet

31:37.040 --> 31:40.840
that you get sick of that sweetness.

31:42.880 --> 31:46.760
He has to keep both the reigns in the hands.

31:47.480 --> 31:52.720
Yes, freedom, all right, the accelerator all right, also the break.

31:54.840 --> 31:59.360
But you always like a person who pampers your ego,

32:00.320 --> 32:03.720
says something very sweet.

32:04.680 --> 32:08.080
What does it take to say sweet these days, people are training them

32:08.680 --> 32:10.840
in that kind of an artificial.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.480
You must judge a person on their vibrations.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.240
But as it is

32:16.520 --> 32:19.520
because you are superficial you cannot feel the vibrations.

32:19.960 --> 32:23.240
You pay attention to people who are nonsensical.

32:23.520 --> 32:27.920
Now accept one thing at that point that you have still mature.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.680
That you don't accept, then your ego comes up "Oh God,"

32:33.120 --> 32:37.960
or you feel guilty. How will you progress then?

32:41.920 --> 32:45.320
Only thing you have to do is to get into a boat, that's all, fully.

32:45.640 --> 32:50.640
But here you put your foot in the mouth of a crocodile, all right.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.680
If you take it out from there, in a  mouth of a shark,

32:57.120 --> 33:02.160
and the boat is pulling you, which way you stand?

33:07.200 --> 33:11.320
But the worst are human sharks and crocodiles

33:11.640 --> 33:14.960
because they never show you their teeth.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.240
They never show you their eyes.

33:21.680 --> 33:26.960
They cover themselves with such deceitful appearances,

33:27.320 --> 33:32.080
such dubious behaviour

33:32.320 --> 33:37.400
that you can't see them unless and until you are a Realised soul.

33:38.320 --> 33:43.200
So now here we go further in our adulthood.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.080
And a woman who is brought up properly,

33:48.200 --> 33:53.480
in her adulthood develops her shyness, her shame, her sense of chastity.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.280
As a child she doesn't know all that.

33:56.480 --> 34:00.400
But here the other way round, as soon as they become adult

34:00.600 --> 34:05.840
they go amuck - boys become vagabonds,

34:06.200 --> 34:08.600
When it is adulthood??

34:09.200 --> 34:13.520
It never happens with animals. I don't know what is this.

34:16.000 --> 34:21.520
But we are Sahaja Yogis and we have our Sahaj culture.

34:22.280 --> 34:26.680
We live with our culture, proud of it, and this is our religion.

34:27.760 --> 34:31.520
We have our pure religion on which we thrive,

34:32.040 --> 34:34.320
we're not going to change.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.320
Ourselves we are going to change the whole world.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.840
We have a culture of our own

34:40.200 --> 34:42.960
and we are going to behave in that manner

34:43.520 --> 34:46.640
which is going to change the whole world.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.880
This is our responsibility.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.600
You are chosen for this work.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.320
You are the real chosen ones. You are the real pure ones.

34:56.600 --> 35:00.040
You are the ones who have established the kalisthan.

35:04.240 --> 35:09.520
Be aware of it, of your responsibility.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.560
Be aware of your powers.

35:14.200 --> 35:18.040
The greatest power that you have is of Divine love,

35:18.320 --> 35:21.040
not the stupid love that blinds you

35:21.280 --> 35:24.560
and that you fall in love, but you rise in love.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.160
The way we talk, the way we walk, the way we live,

35:32.640 --> 35:35.080
the way we behave.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.160
Everything has to be Sahaj.

35:40.320 --> 35:44.400
And it is such a real, living culture

35:45.600 --> 35:49.800
of beautiful people in the world.

35:51.320 --> 35:53.520
We see in the animals

35:54.080 --> 36:00.400
in the birds; we see a swan, it's described.

36:01.600 --> 36:06.040
among animals the elephant, which has the wisdom.

36:06.600 --> 36:11.280
The swan that knows how to separate water from milk.

36:15.080 --> 36:19.760
Then among human beings, Sahaja Yogis.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.000
Today, in these modern times,

36:23.640 --> 36:28.080
I think by the time it is twenty-one years

36:29.400 --> 36:35.320
we will be all very well established, matured,

36:38.240 --> 36:40.800
wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

36:41.200 --> 36:45.840
pulling out this mad world from it's ignorance and from it's Maya.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.960
We'll be that powerful people of love,

36:49.320 --> 36:52.080
of understanding, of discretion

36:52.920 --> 36:55.600
and of humility.

36:55.960 --> 37:00.440
I would like to see those days in my lifetime.

37:01.120 --> 37:05.320
I hope you will give me full asistance.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.120
You have to know

37:08.400 --> 37:13.560
there's only one point was fixed in this meeting of the Devas

37:16.080 --> 37:18.840
and that I cannot overcome.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.760
They said " we'll tolerate any nonsense

37:24.120 --> 37:25.920
because they are coming from ignorance,

37:26.320 --> 37:29.080
but anybody who doesn't love You

37:29.320 --> 37:31.480
anybody who insults You,

37:31.760 --> 37:34.160
anybody who takes advantage of You

37:34.480 --> 37:36.200
anybody who exploits You,

37:36.520 --> 37:41.120
anybody who shows lack of protocol,

37:42.400 --> 37:47.200
anybody who doesn't recognise you, we'll hit them hard,

37:47.480 --> 37:50.320
and that permission You must give us,

37:50.680 --> 37:52.480
otherwise we are not for this work".

37:53.040 --> 37:56.080
They formed a union against Me.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.320
And I had to give in.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.400
And be very careful, I tell you, don't touch me, be careful.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.240
Some people just try to put my sari right.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.720
You're not to do that, don't have to do that.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.240
Don't play with my money,

38:18.120 --> 38:23.840
don't take my hospitality, be careful.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.800
I tell you as much as I can,

38:29.320 --> 38:30.920
and this is what it is.

38:31.320 --> 38:35.240
One side is Mahamaya, another side these deities,

38:35.480 --> 38:38.080
and poor Sahaja Yogis in between.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.280
I sympathise with you, I know

38:46.960 --> 38:49.680
but you better be careful.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.720
It's a razor's edge I think, of course,

38:53.200 --> 38:55.360
but otherwise it's wonderful.

38:57.120 --> 39:02.960
If these two things, if you know, that this is Mahamaya

39:03.840 --> 39:07.520
and that the deities are around sitting now here, all of them,

39:07.800 --> 39:12.360
peering into you, all of them,

39:12.600 --> 39:15.560
judging you, having a big meeting there. Who's who?

39:16.040 --> 39:19.000
Where is the attention of this gentleman? Where is he looking?

39:20.040 --> 39:23.720
What is he doing? They are all sitting here.

39:25.960 --> 39:30.920
But at the same time they are flowers, Divine flowers,

39:31.280 --> 39:36.360
Divine blessings and all the angels are just going round,

39:36.640 --> 39:40.480
I can see them. Your cameras can catch them.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.880
You've got photographs that will show you all of them sitting.

39:44.840 --> 39:50.240
And it's already predicted that the whole world will

39:50.480 --> 39:53.400
come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother,

39:53.680 --> 39:59.120
and that you will decide the future of this world.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.120
It is written already, fourteen-thousand years back,

40:02.440 --> 40:05.320
and there's another one who's prophesizing the same.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.320
So you have to be aware.

40:20.320 --> 40:22.760
Where is your attention?

40:29.480 --> 40:31.920
What are you worried about?

40:32.320 --> 40:35.280
Where are you spending your time?

40:36.480 --> 40:39.200
Leave your children to me.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.040
Leave your families to me.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.360
You can only keep your purse,

40:48.480 --> 40:51.400
but the rest of it,

40:53.320 --> 40:56.040
you can leave all your headaches to Me.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.200
But don't play tricks with Me.

41:03.240 --> 41:09.400
Mahamaya knows all your tricks, everything, in and out.

41:10.680 --> 41:14.200
If I want to know, I can know each and everything about you.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.440
I don't want to know.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.680
Under these circumstances

41:26.640 --> 41:30.760
we are supported, looked after,

41:32.640 --> 41:37.480
managed, taken to reality so easily,

41:38.320 --> 41:42.040
so much, with care.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.600
You tell me "Mother, suddenly I went there

41:44.840 --> 41:47.480
and what do I find, Sahaja Yogis sitting there.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.720
And we wanted to know someone. He was just there.

41:51.080 --> 41:53.040
How is it?"

41:56.920 --> 42:00.200
You are assisted.

42:00.480 --> 42:04.120
Here these Prime Ministers have only five, six bodyguards,

42:04.400 --> 42:09.520
you have millions and millions, each one of you, with you.

42:11.240 --> 42:15.400
Nobody can touch you except for you can harm yourself that's all.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.840
Nobody can harm you.

42:18.600 --> 42:22.920
So today, again a day of great determination,

42:24.520 --> 42:26.480
and taking a vow

42:26.760 --> 42:32.040
that for us, our ascent is the only concern,

42:32.960 --> 42:37.080
is the only idea, nothing else,

42:38.040 --> 42:39.840
and it will work out.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.920
All the rest will be taken care of.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.080
You have all the mechanics to do that,

42:47.520 --> 42:52.200
but first give it to the mechanics to work out.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.240
All will work in a reflex action.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.760
Clear, clear out your chakras.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.800
Don't say "I have this, I have that." Just clear out.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.720
"How dare I have all these problems."

43:05.320 --> 43:08.400
How dare I have all these chakras still lingering.

43:08.920 --> 43:13.440
Clear out, morning, evening. Clear out.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.760
I'm sure it will work out.

43:20.040 --> 43:24.560
Next year I hope I'll have some good news.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.720
May God Bless You.
