00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.040
Sahasrara Puja, "How it was decided". Fregene (Italy), 8 May 1988.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.600
Today is the nineteenth Sahasrara Day.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.400
If you count the first one the day the Sahasrara was opened.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.120
I'll have to tell..

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.520
I'll have to tell you the story

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.920
about the Sahasrara day,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.200
about which it was decided, long time back,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.640
before I incarnated.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.360
They had a big meeting in the heavens,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.800
all the thirty-five crores (350 million)

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.480
of Gods, the deities were there present

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.520
to decide what is to be done.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.520
This is the ultimate that we have to give to human beings,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.440
is to open their Sahasrara;

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.760
to open their awareness to the Spirit;

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.680
to the real knowledge of the Divine.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.600
To remove the darkness of ignorance,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.880
and it had to be spontaneously,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.320
because it has to work - the living force of God.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.840
Also it had to be very quick.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640
So all the Gods requested that now,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.960
I, the Adi Shakti, has to take the birth.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.400
They all tried their best.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.680
They did whatever was possible,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.240
the saints were made by them, but very few.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.360
They incarnated and people made religions out of them

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.760
which were perverted - brought them bad name.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.080
No reality in those religions.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.200
These religions were money oriented

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.840
or power oriented.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.320
There was no Divine force working, actually it was all anti-divine.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.480
How to now turn human beings

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.640
away from these superficial religions,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.680
these perverted paths of destruction.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.520
How to tell them about all these established organisations.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.960
For ages they have been ruling,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.600
making money, making power.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.960
It was a tremendous task,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.080
had to be done with great patience and the love.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.360
It was a very delicate work also,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.680
because they believed in those religions,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.400
innocent people, simple people.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.520
To blast them that this is all nonsense,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.080
UNCLEAR (they/there) are no religions,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.240
they are against incarnations, against all the prophets,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.960
against all the saints.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.840
That's why all the real saints had to suffer.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.800
It's a powerful work that was to be done,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.200
and that's why Adi Shakti had to take birth on this earth.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.760
It had to be before the sixth of May

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.920
because sixth of May was the doomsday in that year.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.280
It was done on the fifth of May at the nick of time.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.440
It was all decided beforehand,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.960
and every deity's job was allotted to all of them.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.080
Very efficient deities, very obedient,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.920
they knew me very well.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.840
Completely dedicated and devoted.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.240
They knew me very very well,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.360
every end of my hair, they knew.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.320
I didn't have to teach them protocol,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.960
love itself gives you protocol

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.160
but love that is Divine, is not selfish love.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.320
It's not the way we love my child, my husband,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.520
my country, my clothes.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.360
It is the love

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.080
which is Divine,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.800
which spreads from your heart,

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.560
from your Spirit,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.640
like the light of knowledge.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.800
What a tremendous task it was.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.200
So I said, at Sahasrara

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.920
I had to be Mahamaya.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.880
I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be something

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.200
that people can't recognise me easily.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.560
But deities know!

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.680
This Mahamaya had to come on this earth,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.520
not the Adi Shakti in her purest form, it's too much.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.840
So she was covered with this Mahamaya.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.320
Now you see,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.520
in nineteen years what we have achieved.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.760
So many yogis are sitting before me.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.680
The difference between

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.480
a saint and a yogi is

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.200
that a saint himself is righteous,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.600
himself is holy,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.480
but he doesn't know much about the Kundalini.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.200
But the yogi knows about the Kundalini.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.680
But the difference between a yogi and a Sahaja Yogini -

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.400
Sahaja Yogi, is that a Sahaja Yogi has powers.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.400
A Sahaja Yogini has powers to give realisation to others.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.520
A yogi can cleanse himself but he cannot cleanse others,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.840
while a Sahaja Yogi can cleanse others and cleanse himself.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.320
So this is the superior most state

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.480
which you achieved through your

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.760
great punyas I should say.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.080
So many of you have been searching the truth in previous lives,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:57.440
and now here you are to achieve

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.480
what you have been searching for.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.320
All that has happened now, so beautifully.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.400
You are not even aware what has happened to you.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.360
Automatically,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.920
spontaneously you have got the powers

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.120
within your central nervous system in a split of a second.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.200
Your attention has been fixed now.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.080
Of course even now some people don't have.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.280
Even now I see the attention wobbles.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.520
But so many of you have achieved that state as he was saying,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.400
Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham. You have it.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.360
What Adi Shankaracharya has described about himself,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.680
you can say that about all of you.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.640
So many Adi Shankaracharyas sitting before Me.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.920
But still I am a Mahamaya.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.600
I just behave like you,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.520
I too have a family,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.840
I too have children which can be called as mine,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.400
and you are my children too.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.320
So when you are mature enough

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.640
the first sign is that you get discretion.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.160
That Divine discretion is love, again.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:51.280
But I see people falter. They don't mind saying

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.800
"Mother, I am catching on my Agnya."

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.600
Why? You know how to cleanse it.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.680
You know what to do about it.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.280
Why don't you clear it? Why don't you get to it?

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.600
What is the thing? The Maya.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.040
First starts

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.080
the problem of family.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.080
My wife, my mother, my brother,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.800
my husband, my children, all right.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.000
That's Maya.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.040
With that you get drowned.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.400
Again you are brought up.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.520
Then subtler and subtler this Maya becomes.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.040
The situation of the family improves, everybody knows that.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.680
But so many falter,

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.920
so many get lost

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.920
in Sahaja Yoga because they had a bad wife or a bad husband.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.040
You have to ascend alone, yourself.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.680
You don't have to depend on others.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.880
And those who do not allow you to ascend have to be thrown away.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.840
Nothing is more important than your ascent;

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.280
higher and higher, because it has a very great Divine purpose.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.080
The ultimate, the climax

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.440
where the whole humanity is to be saved through your efforts.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.400
You have to work it out.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.240
And at this situation we see the thousand petals.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:05.040
These are the powers of Virata within you.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.320
And this is where we falter,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.320
that the light of the Sahasrara

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.600
is the Brahmarandhra, which is your heart chakra.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.840
Now the heart chakra can be also misunderstood, very much.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.840
And this misunderstanding always comes

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.920
from the Mahamaya, for testing.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:42.320
Like we have, say, we have to have a family.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.480
We must have good families, we must have good children.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.160
Immediately the Mahamaya acts.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.960
We start worrying about the husband, worrying about the family.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.680
We should be your family.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.680
There's a saying in Sanskrit:

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.200
”Udāracharitānām vasudhaiva vasu kutumbakam”

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.840
the one who are of a character of saints,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.920
the whole world is their family.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.800
You worry about an individual family

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.200
so that the collective family is strengthened,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.400
not to worry about individual families,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.440
so that the collective suffers.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.400
And if there is such a family tie, better throw it away.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.440
We have to sacrifice.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.840
No sacrifice, it's only getting rid of the disease.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.720
So we waste our time with our children,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.640
with our family, which is very small.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.920
Then the situation changes in different areas,

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:19.200
that's the compassion,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.760
the love and affection.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.760
We believe that we have to love Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.640
I asked somebody to go away,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.600
because he had a disease and he told me lies.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.120
So a negative person's attention will go to him more,

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.520
and will try to look after that person more

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.600
than to other Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.400
Do you have more compassion and love than I have?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:18.040
Why do you get attracted to people who are out of Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.320
Why do you sympathise with people

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.120
who are like this.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.200
You are not here to help

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.400
the downtrodden, the poor,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.640
the so called suffering people.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.160
No, you are not incarnations.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.080
You are not here to help women

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.920
who are crying all the time,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.000
and to children who had to be separated from their parents.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.240
It's a hospital that we are in.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.920
We are getting cured all of us.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.360
Have you heard of a patient going and helping other patients?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.760
It's the doctors that have to do the job.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.440
But Sahaja Yogis always, in the beginning,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.480
used to fall a prey to this kind of an appeal;

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.680
like a bad apple, and there are many good apples.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.520
How can the good apples cure the bad apple, can they?

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.480
Even if you put

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.800
twenty thousand on top of that bad apple it will spoil all others.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.120
That's not your job, that's the job of God.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:59.240
Only thing what you can do is to pull that person

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.600
in the collectivity showing that

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.840
you are wrong, you are wrong, you are wrong -

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.440
and you have to be all right.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.120
But these ideas, I don't know from where they have crawled,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.320
that there's nothing like evil in this world.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.200
There's nothing like bad in this world. There is evil,

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.040
there is something bad.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.480
And you can know, if your vibrations are correct,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.760
your discretion is correct you'll know immediately.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.640
So you waste your energies in correcting people

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.840
who can never, never be corrected,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.320
and forgetting that you have not corrected the person,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.720
on the contrary you are corrupted.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.320
That means that you are not yet matured enough.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.400
In the breaking of the Sahasrara

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.640
I have never left anything undone, it's a perfect job.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.040
Your nerves are not hurt. Your brain is not hurt.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.760
Such a powerful Kundalini comes up.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.920
How sweetly, beautifully, delicately she pierces through.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.440
Only a thread comes out.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.320
And how then the connection is established

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.400
and the relaxation starts coming in on the sympathetic.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.760
How all the beautifully all the chakras open

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.920
and more of these threads are coming up.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.680
Now you are also told how to work it out.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.480
You know all the technical know-how.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.320
What you don't know, that you are not yet a perfect machine.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.400
You have to perfect yourself, moreover there's a Mahamaya.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.600
She doesn't take you for granted, that's the trouble.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.960
She puts you deliberately into temptations.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.040
Deliberately she gives you positions.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.200
Now leaders, world leaders, universe leaders.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:26.400
and so - you develop first one tail, then one horn,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.080
and then something comes out of Sahasrara also.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.240
Look like a clown.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.320
To test you she may marry you to funny people also.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.520
This testing has to be done.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.400
That's the job of a Mahamaya. She has to test you.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.120
Gold has to be tested.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.440
The diamond has to be tested.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.040
All that is valuable has to be tested.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.400
Without that how can you certify.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.200
It's not like going to the church.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.920
Somebody puts the water on your head, all right,

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:14.120
now you are baptised. Finished, now you are chosen.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.280
The water will evaporate in no time.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.960
And when you will go to God he'll say

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.120
"How are you baptised?", "This water",

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.880
"Where is it? I can't see it."

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.320
So all these things are to be understood in right perspective.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.280
They are for our ascent.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.960
For our benevolence. For our higher state.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:48.440
But for that,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.520
you must know, we have to fix up

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.520
our whole will to it.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.960
When people climb, say, Himalayas.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.560
What do they do?

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.120
They take a big nail, nail it at a higher point,

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.680
then tie up a rope and climb up to that.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.920
They don't look down.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.400
Then put another nail up there, climb up to that.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.760
And that's how they climb Himalayas.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.640
Now what do we do in Sahaja Yoga, we take a nail

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.080
from the top, put it downward.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:41.080
First day when you get realisation the experience is tremendous.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.520
Then one by one coming down, the other way round.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.440
But as soon as you get realisation, if you are intelligent enough,

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:58.000
then you decide; "How should I fix up myself?"

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:05.200
Like, decide like this:

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.000
Supposing you are very fond of milk, take it like this.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.400
Now you should say "Till I achieve a certain state

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.920
I'll not take milk."

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.200
But that should not be treated as a sacrifice

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.840
but as a joyous ascent.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.160
Do the people who nail upwards to go to

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.320
the top of the Himalayas,

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.240
do they feel they are sacrificing something.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.560
If you start thinking that "Oh God I have sacrificed milk."

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.440
Then you're finished. Downward movement starts.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.840
But if you like something,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.640
then you have to say "all right if I like it,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.440
let me like my ascent more than this.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.880
Till I have ascended I will not have."

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.160
Such determination should be there.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.280
And without that how do you think

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.600
you can get over the horrible,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.680
monstrous mountain of ignorance that you have got?

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.440
Actually, in realisation I have put you on the top of the mountain.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.760
But you start slipping down.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.800
So you have to keep to that topmost point.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:47.640
I tell you about everything.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.680
You go and ask anyone of the saints or

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.200
anyone of the great incarnations,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.480
did they know so much about Kundalini.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.240
If they had they would have written about it.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.200
They have never written anything about Kundalini.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.480
If they have it's very little.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.120
To such an extent that it acts on your fingertips.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.600
That now we have brought science

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.160
close to reality,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:39.320
the truth, the Divine science,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.200
all explained.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.320
It's become completely integrated now with us.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.320
Sahaja Yoga is the most scientific thing

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.520
that you could think of, exact.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.400
The biggest computer that you are,

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.520
but the computer has to be workable.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.120
And there's why we have failed.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.280
And we fail every day.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.680
Sometimes it is disastrous, horrible.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.240
Now nineteen years we have had the Sahasrara,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.520
and eighteen years I have worked.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.800
You have to now understand your responsibility.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.320
We have to emancipate the human beings.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.320
We don't want to do anything

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.320
that is a little out the way.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.600
Now Sahasrara day is on the fifth,

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.480
but we must celebrate today

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.680
because everybody must have a Sunday holiday.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.240
According to our conveniences, we have to work out everything.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.600
All right, doesn't matter. It's permitted.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.240
The deities, they are working twenty-four hours,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.200
all the months and all the years now, continuously.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.960
Because they have a continuous supply of energy,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.000
which you can also have.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.600
The importance given to your ascent

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.320
is very little, I think,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.400
compared to the growth of eighteen years.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.680
You know in the western countries, after eighteen years

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.680
you are regarded as adults, no more children,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.200
you all have become now adults.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:16.320
Adults, all right, but I don't know how far you have grown.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:22.200
I don't know really, you are still big babies,

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.400
or you have really achieved that state of adulthood.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.080
And there, at that time, you are given lots of

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.440
concessions and freedoms and rights.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.960
You have already all rights:

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.360
if you want to go to heaven you can go,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.480
if you want to go to hell you can go,

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.560
all freedom, no problem on that.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.960
But the adults are those who have discretion,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.080
who know what is the purpose of their life,

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.280
who can do anything to achieve that purpose,

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.160
who have powers to fight and understand.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.240
While I find people who are even grown up people

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.000
in Sahaja Yoga, behave in such a manner.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.040
that you're surprised, how do you get impressed

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.640
by superficial people, by superficiality.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.120
If somebody is very sweet to talk,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.600
doesn't mean that person is good, that person is Divine, does it?

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.600
On the contrary a Divine person is never that sweet

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.840
that you get sick of that sweetness.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.760
He has to keep both the reigns in the hands.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.720
Yes, freedom, all right, the accelerator all right, also the break.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.360
But you always like a person who pampers your ego,

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.720
says something very sweet.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.080
What does it take to say sweet these days, people are training them

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.840
in that kind of an artificial.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.480
You must judge a person on their vibrations.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.240
But as it is

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.520
because you are superficial you cannot feel the vibrations.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.240
You pay attention to people who are nonsensical.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.920
Now accept one thing at that point that you have still mature.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.680
That you don't accept, then your ego comes up "Oh God,"

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.960
or you feel guilty. How will you progress then?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.320
Only thing you have to do is to get into a boat, that's all, fully.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.640
But here you put your foot in the mouth of a crocodile, all right.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.680
If you take it out from there, in a  mouth of a shark,

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:02.160
and the boat is pulling you, which way you stand?

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.320
But the worst are human sharks and crocodiles

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.960
because they never show you their teeth.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.240
They never show you their eyes.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.960
They cover themselves with such deceitful appearances,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:32.080
such dubious behaviour

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.400
that you can't see them unless and until you are a Realised soul.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.200
So now here we go further in our adulthood.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.080
And a woman who is brought up properly,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.480
in her adulthood develops her shyness, her shame, her sense of chastity.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.280
As a child she doesn't know all that.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.400
But here the other way round, as soon as they become adult

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.840
they go amuck - boys become vagabonds,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.600
When it is adulthood??

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.520
It never happens with animals. I don't know what is this.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.520
But we are Sahaja Yogis and we have our Sahaj culture.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.680
We live with our culture, proud of it, and this is our religion.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.520
We have our pure religion on which we thrive,

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.320
we're not going to change.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.320
Ourselves we are going to change the whole world.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.840
We have a culture of our own

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.960
and we are going to behave in that manner

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.640
which is going to change the whole world.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.880
This is our responsibility.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.600
You are chosen for this work.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.320
You are the real chosen ones. You are the real pure ones.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.040
You are the ones who have established the kalisthan.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.520
Be aware of it, of your responsibility.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.560
Be aware of your powers.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.040
The greatest power that you have is of Divine love,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.040
not the stupid love that blinds you

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.560
and that you fall in love, but you rise in love.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.160
The way we talk, the way we walk, the way we live,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.080
the way we behave.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.160
Everything has to be Sahaj.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.400
And it is such a real, living culture

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.800
of beautiful people in the world.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.520
We see in the animals

00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:00.400
in the birds; we see a swan, it's described.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.040
among animals the elephant, which has the wisdom.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.280
The swan that knows how to separate water from milk.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.760
Then among human beings, Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.000
Today, in these modern times,

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.080
I think by the time it is twenty-one years

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:35.320
we will be all very well established, matured,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.800
wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.840
pulling out this mad world from it's ignorance and from it's Maya.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.960
We'll be that powerful people of love,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.080
of understanding, of discretion

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.600
and of humility.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.440
I would like to see those days in my lifetime.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:05.320
I hope you will give me full asistance.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.120
You have to know

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.560
there's only one point was fixed in this meeting of the Devas

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.840
and that I cannot overcome.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.760
They said " we'll tolerate any nonsense

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.920
because they are coming from ignorance,

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.080
but anybody who doesn't love You

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.480
anybody who insults You,

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.160
anybody who takes advantage of You

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.200
anybody who exploits You,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:41.120
anybody who shows lack of protocol,

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.200
anybody who doesn't recognise you, we'll hit them hard,

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.320
and that permission You must give us,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.480
otherwise we are not for this work".

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.080
They formed a union against Me.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.320
And I had to give in.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.400
And be very careful, I tell you, don't touch me, be careful.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.240
Some people just try to put my sari right.

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.720
You're not to do that, don't have to do that.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.240
Don't play with my money,

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.840
don't take my hospitality, be careful.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.800
I tell you as much as I can,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.920
and this is what it is.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.240
One side is Mahamaya, another side these deities,

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.080
and poor Sahaja Yogis in between.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.280
I sympathise with you, I know

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.680
but you better be careful.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.720
It's a razor's edge I think, of course,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.360
but otherwise it's wonderful.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.960
If these two things, if you know, that this is Mahamaya

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.520
and that the deities are around sitting now here, all of them,

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.360
peering into you, all of them,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.560
judging you, having a big meeting there. Who's who?

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.000
Where is the attention of this gentleman? Where is he looking?

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.720
What is he doing? They are all sitting here.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.920
But at the same time they are flowers, Divine flowers,

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:36.360
Divine blessings and all the angels are just going round,

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.480
I can see them. Your cameras can catch them.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.880
You've got photographs that will show you all of them sitting.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.240
And it's already predicted that the whole world will

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.400
come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:59.120
and that you will decide the future of this world.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.120
It is written already, fourteen-thousand years back,

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.320
and there's another one who's prophesizing the same.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.320
So you have to be aware.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.760
Where is your attention?

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.920
What are you worried about?

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.280
Where are you spending your time?

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.200
Leave your children to me.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.040
Leave your families to me.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.360
You can only keep your purse,

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.400
but the rest of it,

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.040
you can leave all your headaches to Me.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.200
But don't play tricks with Me.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:09.400
Mahamaya knows all your tricks, everything, in and out.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.200
If I want to know, I can know each and everything about you.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.440
I don't want to know.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.680
Under these circumstances

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.760
we are supported, looked after,

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:37.480
managed, taken to reality so easily,

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.040
so much, with care.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.600
You tell me "Mother, suddenly I went there

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.480
and what do I find, Sahaja Yogis sitting there.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.720
And we wanted to know someone. He was just there.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.040
How is it?"

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.200
You are assisted.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.120
Here these Prime Ministers have only five, six bodyguards,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.520
you have millions and millions, each one of you, with you.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.400
Nobody can touch you except for you can harm yourself that's all.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.840
Nobody can harm you.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.920
So today, again a day of great determination,

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.480
and taking a vow

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:32.040
that for us, our ascent is the only concern,

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.080
is the only idea, nothing else,

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.840
and it will work out.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.920
All the rest will be taken care of.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.080
You have all the mechanics to do that,

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.200
but first give it to the mechanics to work out.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.240
All will work in a reflex action.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.760
Clear, clear out your chakras.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.800
Don't say "I have this, I have that." Just clear out.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.720
"How dare I have all these problems."

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.400
How dare I have all these chakras still lingering.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.440
Clear out, morning, evening. Clear out.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.760
I'm sure it will work out.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.560
Next year I hope I'll have some good news.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.720
May God Bless You.
