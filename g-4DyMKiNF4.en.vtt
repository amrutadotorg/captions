00:02.640 --> 00:09.640
Today, it’s a great day that you are here
to worship your Guru in the realm of the heart

00:18.640 --> 00:25.640
of the universe. If we can do that in our
domain of the heart, we don’t have to do

00:32.490 --> 00:35.150
anything else.

00:35.150 --> 00:42.150
Today, also, I feel I have to tell you about
Sahaja Yoga and its value, which is related

00:59.970 --> 01:06.970
to other Yogas which were accepted in the
olden days all over the world. They called

01:13.900 --> 01:20.900
it, one, as the Yoga – not Sahaja Yoga,
Yoga. It started with various types of practices

01:29.240 --> 01:33.520
of ‘Ashtanga’ [Sanskrit/Hindi meaning
‘having eight stages/parts’] Yogas – eightfold

01:33.520 --> 01:40.520
yogas – with a Guru. And one had to go through
lots of hardships. Nobody who was married

01:48.230 --> 01:55.230
was allowed into that Ashtanga Yoga, and they
had to give up their families, give up their

01:59.799 --> 02:06.799
relationships. They had to become
absolutely without any attachments, to go
to a Guru. All their property, all their possessions

02:25.760 --> 02:32.760
were given up. Not to the Guru as is done
in modern times, but given away. And this

02:38.239 --> 02:41.129
was called as Yoga.

02:41.129 --> 02:48.129
The another style was called as Sankhya. Sankhya
is where all your life you have to gather

02:58.989 --> 03:05.989
things with detachment, and then to distribute
them completely and take to a Guru, in a way

03:17.280 --> 03:24.280
completely surrendered, and then get realization.
Sankhya was the left-sided behavior. And the

03:38.299 --> 03:45.299
Yoga was the right-sided. Where the Gayatri
Mantra was used was the Sankhya. Because they

03:51.239 --> 03:58.239
were left-sided, they used to use Gayatri
Mantra. They went so much to the left side

04:04.879 --> 04:11.879
- that is to gather things, to gather possessions,
to gather properties, to gather all kinds

04:13.210 --> 04:20.210
of friends and relations and societies - that
they were afraid that they may be completely

04:25.010 --> 04:32.010
lost into all those things. They would go
to Gayatri, the Mantra of Gayatri which teaches

04:38.350 --> 04:45.350
you the essences of all our Chakras – the
centers. I have told about this before also

04:49.500 --> 04:56.500
– ‘Bhu’, ‘Bhurv’, ‘Swaha’. ‘Bhu’
stands for the essence or the ‘Bija’ of

04:57.410 --> 05:04.410
the ‘Mooladhara’; ‘Bhuv’ for the universe
that is created that is Swadisthana’s ‘Bija’;

05:08.240 --> 05:15.240
‘Swaha’ is the ‘Bija’ of the Nabhi;
‘Manah’ is the essence of the Heart Chakra.

05:24.589 --> 05:31.589
Then, ‘Janah’ is the people, collectivity,
is the essence or the ‘Bija’ of the Vishuddhi

05:34.279 --> 05:41.279
Chakra. Then, ‘Tapah’ is the one where
you go into ‘tapasya’, into renunciation,

05:45.100 --> 05:52.100
into hardships – is the essence of the Agnya
Chakra. And then the ‘Satya’ is the truth,

05:57.940 --> 06:04.940
is the essence of the Sahasrara – not the
truth that we think as truth, but the truth

06:09.619 --> 06:16.619
that is expressed in our central nervous system.
So, this is discovered at the seventh stage

06:24.330 --> 06:31.330
of the Sahasrara. So the people who did Sankhya
were, sort of, not so much respected as spiritual

06:34.929 --> 06:41.929
people, because they thought these are all
involved into worldly things and worldly possessions

06:42.360 --> 06:49.360
and worldly happenings. So, they were regarded
as something secondary. Or those who were

06:55.480 --> 07:02.480
yogis of the Gurus were regarded higher, because
they had already given up everything, and

07:02.880 --> 07:09.880
they have gone to a Guru giving up all the
things that they have. But here, these Gurus

07:14.309 --> 07:21.309
had a problem within themselves because they
found that those who came to them gave up

07:22.739 --> 07:29.739
everything – no doubt – but still there
was lurking attachments. In their own ‘Ashramas’

07:29.820 --> 07:35.760
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning hermitages] they found,
these people had their own attachments to

07:35.760 --> 07:42.700
things. Though outwardly they had given up,
but inside they had not given up. So, they

07:42.700 --> 07:49.700
were still sticking on to these ideas that,
‘Oh, its all right. But still we can have

07:52.029 --> 07:58.250
little things like that, doesn’t matter.’
Like that, there was little compromises going

07:58.250 --> 08:03.100
on. Like, as we have here nunneries and all
that. So both, in a way, were artificial.

08:03.100 --> 08:10.100
The one side, is the Sankhyas, were trying
to ascend with all the luggage they were carrying.

08:22.980 --> 08:29.980
And another were trying to descend with all
the ambitions of ascent.

08:31.559 --> 08:38.559
So, it was a very funny thing in every aspect,
in both these styles of Yoga. As you can see

08:46.780 --> 08:53.780
that now, if you go to America you’ll find,
‘Oh God, what is this America? It’s not

08:55.800 --> 09:02.800
democracy, it’s demonocracy.’ But if you
go from that in the realm of another country

09:03.900 --> 09:10.900
like Russia, you find - what is this? You
are working here under complete pressures

09:13.099 --> 09:20.030
and fears. But as soon as a Russian comes
out of that country, he can become worse than

09:20.030 --> 09:27.030
an American. So what is this? One theory works
here, another theory works there. So which

09:27.800 --> 09:34.800
is the theory that is all right? Same you
find about religion. Say, a religion, which

09:36.930 --> 09:43.580
believes in many Gods, like the Hindus, they
are also believing now into the ‘Bhoots’.

09:43.580 --> 09:50.580
And they are also following the path of possessions.
If you go to a temple, every temple has got

09:56.490 --> 10:03.490
nice arrangement for you to get possessed.
Or even a church, or a mosque – where God

10:07.870 --> 10:14.870
has to reside, you find suddenly you get attacked
and you come out absolutely puzzled about

10:16.590 --> 10:23.039
yourself, ending up into lunatic asylums.
So what sort of worshipping places are these,

10:23.039 --> 10:30.039
where you go to find God and you get the horrible
satanic forces acting on you? That’s why,

10:32.240 --> 10:39.240
in the modern times, people have become so
very confused. We do not find truth in anything

10:44.540 --> 10:51.540
– in any ideologies, any philosophies, anything
that started… say, Confusius started humanism,

10:55.140 --> 11:02.140
Socrates started another thing, Mohammad Saheb
started another thing. Like Mohammad Saheb

11:02.190 --> 11:09.190
said let us not worship God as an idol; let
us worship Him in the ‘Nirakara’, in the

11:10.580 --> 11:17.580
formless God. But you see the formless? How
they are killing each other now? I mean, after

11:19.560 --> 11:25.419
seeing the Muslim countries, you can’t believe
there could be any formless or formful God

11:25.419 --> 11:32.419
existing anywhere – all must have run away
- the way they are fighting. Then you see

11:32.620 --> 11:39.620
the Christian countries. Wherever they have
gone, they have tried to dominate other people

11:46.780 --> 11:53.780
who were not Christians, just as if they had
a right to do it because they were Christians.

12:02.700 --> 12:07.200
The Disciples of Christ, who said, “Forgive
them for they do not know what they are doing.”

12:07.200 --> 12:14.200
And I have to say the same for all the Christians,
“Forgive them for they do not know what

12:16.640 --> 12:23.539
they are doing.” And when you are shocked
at all these things, one must sit down and

12:23.539 --> 12:30.539
think what is to be done, what’s the problem
is.

12:31.680 --> 12:38.680
So, it is neither Sankhya nor Yoga; then what
is it you have to achieve? That is Sahaja

12:41.740 --> 12:48.740
Yoga. Sahaja Yog is a system in which first
you are not given a theory, but the light

12:50.760 --> 12:57.760
in your hand to see for yourself in which
both things look the same. For example, now

12:58.159 --> 13:05.159
you have got this beautiful house made for
your Mother, while your Mother doesn’t know

13:12.120 --> 13:16.810
how to get attached to even a pin. It’s
a funny situation.

13:16.810 --> 13:20.460
Everybody has to remind Me, “Mother it is
Your house.”

13:20.460 --> 13:21.659
“Oh I see.”

13:21.659 --> 13:28.659
And I have to be reminded I must thank you
all, specially the English, specially the

13:38.320 --> 13:45.320
leaders of English Sahaja yogis, for making
full effort to get this house. But then, I

13:48.650 --> 13:55.650
think why should I thank? It’s not mine,
it’s theirs – and that’s what it is.

14:02.330 --> 14:09.330
So a new type of confusion starts, and that’s
what I felt that this confusion is very sweet

14:15.979 --> 14:22.979
and beautiful. It’s a fact that nothing
belongs to us, but every thing belongs to

14:28.710 --> 14:35.490
us. When I think about how beautifully you
have done this place, it belongs to Me, all

14:35.490 --> 14:42.490
right; this house belongs to Me; England belongs
to Me and above all, the whole world belongs

14:59.310 --> 15:06.310
to Me. That’s how we see Sankhya and Yoga
become one in Sahaja Yoga. And it’s said

15:28.440 --> 15:35.440
that when you see Sankhya and Yoga as one,
then only ‘Sapashyati’ – that’s the

15:35.620 --> 15:38.880
one who sees; that’s the one is the witness.

15:38.880 --> 15:45.880
So, for normal people it could be that how
is it your Mother is supposed to be a Guru

15:53.120 --> 15:59.770
and She wears all ornaments? But what to do?
She’s also a Mother and She is also a Goddess.

15:59.770 --> 16:06.770
Another confusion. How to make these two things
be? You see a Guru has to be a very angry

16:13.719 --> 16:19.610
person, wearing only single dress either upwards
or downwards, I don’t know how, with a big

16:19.610 --> 16:26.610
thick rod in the hand, never smiling – laughing
no question – smiling. And the Gurus have

16:34.599 --> 16:41.599
to be very long faced, developing big, big
beards, and no ladies allowed. In such a situation,

16:43.149 --> 16:50.149
where the women are not to be seen at all,
I mean I shouldn’t even see My face - it’s

17:01.870 --> 17:08.870
like that. There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures - not scriptures, I would say

17:12.179 --> 17:19.179
the critiques, whether a woman should be allowed
to do the spiritual practices or not – imagine.

17:26.939 --> 17:33.939
Not only among Christians, you’ll be surprised,
even in Indian scriptures - whether is woman

17:34.110 --> 17:41.110
is allowed or not to do spiritual practices.
Now when your Mother is a woman and She is

17:45.510 --> 17:52.510
your Guru, what will you do? This is another
confusion because it is wrong, the whole thing

17:59.400 --> 18:06.400
is falsehood, based on no basis at all. You
may try anything to say that women are not

18:13.380 --> 18:20.380
meant for spiritual life, try any argument,
it fails. The other day I met one big John

18:27.620 --> 18:34.620
in a University, big fellow, I might say really
hard nut, and he started saying, “We Christians

18:40.020 --> 18:47.020
cannot accept a woman to be God.”

18:48.360 --> 18:55.059
I said, “Why?”

18:55.059 --> 18:57.900
“Because…”

18:57.900 --> 19:04.900
So to put all these upside-down stories right,
your Mother had to come on this earth as a

19:18.860 --> 19:25.860
Guru. I got to this point out of one little
confusion I had about Myself. The other day,

19:32.059 --> 19:35.380
somebody was after My life that I should buy
a bracelet. I said, “I have no money anymore;

19:35.380 --> 19:35.630
I don’t want to buy.”

19:35.449 --> 19:37.260
“All right we will give it in Puja.”

19:37.260 --> 19:40.900
I said, “But now there is only Guru Puja.”

19:40.900 --> 19:43.280
Said, “All right, we will give it in Guru
Puja.”

19:43.280 --> 19:50.140
I said, “To buy a bracelet in Guru Puja
is something funny I have done.”

19:50.140 --> 19:57.140
After all, in a Guru Puja you don’t give
a bracelet to your Guru, do you? You can give,

19:58.069 --> 20:05.069
say, a big rod; or you might give him a sandalwood
‘Khada’ - what is it called - ‘Chappals’,

20:09.270 --> 20:16.270
or you may give him a shawl. But here it is…
I have asked… all right give it in Guru

20:17.420 --> 20:24.420
Puja. What was the reason? And I became aware
of My own confusion and I thought of it. I

20:29.170 --> 20:36.170
said, “This is what it is, that it has to
happen this way that, on a Guru Puja you have

20:37.150 --> 20:44.150
to give a bracelet to your Guru.” Let us
change it over. The whole thing has to be

20:46.970 --> 20:53.970
brought up this way that everything faces
reality. All these false ideas have to be

20:58.090 --> 21:05.090
given up. Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down. But, if you

21:05.720 --> 21:12.720
put the carpet right, everything falls in
line. And that’s why you needed a Mother

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
to give you realization, and a Guru as a Mother
to teach you that for ascent of God nobody

21:24.540 --> 21:29.850
can be prohibited.

21:29.850 --> 21:36.850
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working
out. In all directions, if you find, to put

21:36.890 --> 21:43.890
all upside-down things into right direction,
to expose it to reality, to bring all real

21:48.179 --> 21:55.179
values, to abolish all rotten value systems,
all political, economic systems, all spiritual

22:07.920 --> 22:14.920
theologies, all psychological and all such
nonsensical ideas into its proper direction.

22:22.059 --> 22:29.059
How in one incarnation it has worked out,
you can imagine. How in one incarnation all

22:37.380 --> 22:41.689
these ideas have been put right.

22:41.689 --> 22:48.689
Another idea exists, among Hindus, that if
you are a religious people, you should be

22:49.270 --> 22:56.270
a vegetarian. All the Brahmins believe this,
and even the non-Brahmins. But we had a Brahmin

22:57.699 --> 23:04.380
working in one of the places where I was living,
and they said that for Mother we have to give

23:04.380 --> 23:11.380
meat, She doesn’t eat anything else. She
has to eat proteins. She said, “Yes,yes,

23:12.580 --> 23:17.000
Of course. For a Mother, She must have.”
Whether it’s a Brahmin or a non-Brahmin,

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
all understand that Mother has to eat proteins.
Because She has to drink the blood of all

23:24.199 --> 23:27.920
these ‘rakshasas’ [Hindi meaning demons],
how can She be vegetarian? And if She has

23:27.920 --> 23:34.920
to kill so many devils, how can She be non-violent?
So the contrast that you see in the description

23:46.600 --> 23:53.600
of the Mother - that She is the one who is
the most furious personality when it comes

23:56.439 --> 24:03.439
to the killing of the people who are of the
negative land, who are trying to destroy Her

24:05.330 --> 24:12.330
creation, Her own children; and She is the
sweetest and the mildest person for Her own

24:13.350 --> 24:20.350
children. These two contrasts should be seen.
Even in animals you’ll find the same contrast,

24:20.580 --> 24:27.580
but very evident in an incarnation like this.
And today, through Sahaja Yoga, we have been

24:29.790 --> 24:35.569
able to prove that Sankhya and Yoga are the
same.

24:35.569 --> 24:42.220
Whether you collect things, whether you have
possessions or whether you give away, makes

24:42.220 --> 24:49.220
no difference to a person who is detached
from within. If you collect them for others,

24:53.870 --> 25:00.870
even better. But if you collect for yourself
and then give away, that’s even much better.

25:02.730 --> 25:07.120
Because first you collect for yourself then
you think, “Oh it’s good for me, I will

25:07.120 --> 25:14.069
use this one for myself, will be a good idea”
- so the self is there - but then, that you

25:14.069 --> 25:18.460
give away. That means your detachment is complete.
Or the third personality could be liking [not

25:18.460 --> 25:25.460
clear]… which just goes on collecting and
just goes on giving. Without thinking it collects

25:27.640 --> 25:34.429
and without thinking it gives because thinking
is not My job. That is one thing I have given

25:34.429 --> 25:41.429
up – is to think. I don’t want to think
– that’s your work, not Me. And without

25:42.819 --> 25:49.819
thinking, how many things we have achieved
through Sahaja Yoga. Yoga and Sankhya both

25:50.910 --> 25:57.910
are products of thinking, not products of
spontaneity. This house itself is a product

26:01.929 --> 26:08.280
of spontaneity. I mean, as we call the English
as ‘Saablogs’, you see. So I took some

26:08.280 --> 26:13.500
‘Saablogs’ with Me around to see some
houses and they wanted to (see) some houses

26:13.500 --> 26:20.140
with some character – means something must
fall out, something must be crooked, this

26:20.140 --> 26:27.140
should not be straightforward. I said, “Now
please, I can’t bear all this crookedness.”

26:27.520 --> 26:30.520
So, “No, no, but it has character.”

26:30.520 --> 26:35.980
I said, “Now, this kind of a crooked nose
I don’t want.” Straightforward it should

26:35.980 --> 26:42.980
be. So they were rather disappointed at Me.
And the ‘Saablog’ had some other ideas

26:44.580 --> 26:51.309
also that, say for example, if you go to,
say, to a place called Windmere, it’s a

26:51.309 --> 26:58.309
posh place; if you go to the Northside, little
less; then if you go to the east, it’s useless

27:01.820 --> 27:08.820
– like that. I said, “Let’s go the north,
northest as far as we can go.” Because,

27:10.199 --> 27:17.199
you know, the Godess has to be ‘Dakshinamurthy’.
She has to be on the north side to be on the

27:17.850 --> 27:24.580
- Her eyes on the south. That’s the reason
She has to be… I mean we could not have

27:24.580 --> 27:29.309
been in Scotland – that would have been
too much for you. But that would have been

27:29.309 --> 27:36.309
the ideal for all of us because then our ‘Drishti’
is towards - our vision is towards the south

27:37.980 --> 27:44.980
and we see the whole universe under our own
beautiful visions. So that’s how, spontaneously,

27:50.449 --> 27:57.449
we found this place. And ‘Saablog’ were,
“Yes, No, No, Yes.” But spontaneously

27:58.929 --> 28:05.929
we got it. And then we found out it has a
history; then we found out its beautiful vibrations;

28:09.799 --> 28:16.799
then we found out the potential about it.
Whatever you get spontaneously, it is full

28:17.400 --> 28:19.260
of potentials.

28:19.260 --> 28:26.260
On this point, I have to say a few words,
is important. I had to get - few points I

28:29.910 --> 28:36.910
have to say about spontaneity part which is
quite interesting – the way people think

28:42.860 --> 28:49.860
spontaneity works. Like, it’s mostly ego
part which says, ‘This is spontaneous,’

28:53.100 --> 29:00.100
with so many people. Specially the very old
Sahaja Yogis think they are authorities on

29:04.770 --> 29:11.250
spontaneity. Like, we had a land in Vaitarna.
So one of the older ones went there and he

29:11.250 --> 29:18.250
said, “This land is vibrating and this is
not vibrating.” So everybody accepted, ‘All

29:18.789 --> 29:25.569
right, all right, all right.’ Then they
said, “In this part of the land nobody should

29:25.569 --> 29:32.569
eat their food.” Now, from where does this
knowledge come? Eating food is not a sin,

29:34.799 --> 29:41.799
is it? As if it is a sin that you are eating
food in there. Then religiously they follow

29:43.809 --> 29:50.809
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, z and again a, b,
c, d of Sahaja Yoga to such an extent, ‘ki’

29:53.150 --> 29:58.809
[Hindi meaning ‘that’] I start thinking
now they have become another fanatic Sahaja

29:58.809 --> 30:05.809
Yogis. Fanaticism is against Sahaja Yoga – absolutely.
Now they will ask, “How many times we should

30:06.169 --> 30:13.169
say this ‘Mantra’?” Then I say, “Zero
times.”

30:16.870 --> 30:23.870
“How many drops we should put, the ghee,
in our nose?” Then I say, “A full jug.”

30:36.620 --> 30:43.620
Then, “Oh, I should not have gone from the
left side, I should have gone from the right

30:47.789 --> 30:48.480
side.”

30:48.480 --> 30:52.539
Then, I would say, “You just jump up.”

30:52.539 --> 30:59.539
You have to be like children. But the ideas
are so settled down in Sahaja Yoga, now it’s

31:00.760 --> 31:07.760
so many years of course, but they should not
settle down. If they settle down, it’s not

31:07.970 --> 31:14.970
Sahaja; it’s not spontaneous. ‘If you
do this way, then it is wrong; that way, it’s

31:16.299 --> 31:23.299
wrong’ – nothing of the kind. Nothing
is wrong for you people. If you do anything

31:24.210 --> 31:29.049
wrong, your vibrations will be lost, finished.
What is there to be so cautious? Like, somebody

31:29.049 --> 31:31.960
said, “I don’t want to look at the cigarette.”
I said, “Why?”

31:31.960 --> 31:33.480
“Looking at it also is sinful.”

31:33.480 --> 31:35.780
I said, “Looking at it what happens?”

31:35.780 --> 31:38.100
“Then I feel like smoking.”

31:38.100 --> 31:42.189
So I said, “Better smoke once for all.”

31:42.189 --> 31:49.189
Or, “I cannot hold a wine bottle in my hand.”

31:51.600 --> 31:52.539
“Why?”

31:52.539 --> 31:57.010
“No, holding the wine bottle is sinful.”

31:57.010 --> 32:04.010
I mean, you can swim in the wine. So this
kind of understanding should be there. Though

32:17.199 --> 32:20.760
I have always said that if I say one thing,
you will clinch on to it. So I always say

32:20.760 --> 32:27.330
the other side of it - that don’t stick
on to something; Sahaja Yoga is not for sticking

32:27.330 --> 32:32.630
on to something. Like somebody who had learnt
certain say, lessons about Sahaja Yoga in

32:32.630 --> 32:39.630
the beginning of it, certain Mantras they
had learnt, and still they are sticking on

32:39.870 --> 32:46.580
to the same step. No, no, no, no – you have
to go ahead. This is just a staircase. Don’t

32:46.580 --> 32:53.580
get stuck at a point. We have had so many
such cases here. People get really outworn

32:57.110 --> 33:04.110
as they say. They will go on telling you so
many nonsensical ideas – “You see, if

33:04.250 --> 33:11.010
you do like this, then this happens.” First
of all, you don’t give ideas to others.

33:11.010 --> 33:13.470
That’s one thing - if you decide that we
don’t give ideas about what’s wrong with

33:13.470 --> 33:15.710
another person, half of your job is done.
Because you don’t have to do any job, as

33:15.710 --> 33:22.710
I don’t do. Anybody who comes, “You are
a ‘bhoot’.” You better have it. I get

33:25.460 --> 33:32.460
reports from others. They say that your Sahaja
Yogis are wicked people. I said, “Why?”

33:32.770 --> 33:38.199
“Oh, they tell you, ‘You are evil.’
They tell you, ‘You are possessed’, they

33:38.199 --> 33:44.949
tell you, ‘You are this, you are that’;
they are very wicked people.”

33:44.949 --> 33:51.949
I am really shocked to hear that Sahaja Yogis
- how can they be wicked? If somebody is suffering

33:54.340 --> 33:57.390
from something, in the phone they say, “Oh
you better have it. It’s good for you.”

33:57.390 --> 34:04.390
That’s not the way. We have to be not only
humble, very tactful and sweet to new people

34:08.620 --> 34:14.170
– if you want any more to come in. But if
you have decided not to have anymore, because

34:14.170 --> 34:20.019
you will have to put another marquee, then
I have nothing to say. But if you want others

34:20.019 --> 34:27.019
to come in, then it’s important that you
talk to them in a very sweet and beautiful

34:27.870 --> 34:34.870
language, the way they understand. Rudeness,
arrogance, showing off, is of no use. One

34:35.180 --> 34:42.180
should understand Sahaja Yoga is where you
are in complete enjoyment about it; you are

34:45.090 --> 34:49.700
just lost into that enjoyment. Where is the
time to remember how many times to give a

34:49.700 --> 34:56.700
‘Bandhan’ to yourself? What is the need
to give ‘Bandhan’ to yourself? It’s

34:58.489 --> 35:05.489
all a joke now for you, should be. A little
child sucks the milk from the bottle, all

35:07.660 --> 35:14.660
right, because it has no teeth. But what about
you people having that kind of a thing? It’s

35:19.380 --> 35:26.380
very childish and shows no growth at all.
Sahaja Yoga must grow within. You should not

35:32.180 --> 35:39.180
be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis.
I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja

35:43.840 --> 35:50.710
Yogi is the one who can combine so many things
together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines,

35:50.710 --> 35:53.560
thin ‘Maryadas’ [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning
code of conduct] maintained. But, you cannot

35:53.560 --> 35:55.540
do the other way round.

35:55.540 --> 36:02.540
For example, you shouldn’t say, “All right,
now I will be sweet. Then I will be angry;

36:04.210 --> 36:11.210
then I will be sweet; then I’ll be like
this; then I’ll be like that.” It will

36:13.870 --> 36:20.870
be a hotchpotch. It is a funny personality
you see - suddenly I get angry, like that

36:29.140 --> 36:36.140
[facial expression?], and then I [presumably
Mother demonstrates with facial expression].

36:41.739 --> 36:45.420
People will think you are doing ‘Bharatnatyam’
[a form of Indian classical dance] or something

36:45.420 --> 36:48.160
like that. Showing all your moods – in five
minutes you show ten moods. This is the growth

36:48.160 --> 36:55.160
within you, which will show. So, we have to
have our growth, and for growth, let us be

36:56.690 --> 37:03.690
silent within. Let us not react to others
- “This person is like that, that person

37:04.249 --> 37:11.249
is like that.” What about yourself? Also
there… other ways. Like, I tell somebody

37:13.930 --> 37:19.979
that, you see, you have this problem. So that
person immediately goes to the second person

37:19.979 --> 37:23.509
and says, “You see, Mother told me that
you too have this problem, better look after

37:23.509 --> 37:28.360
it.” I didn’t tell that person; I told
you. Keep it to yourself. So, ‘Mother says’

37:28.360 --> 37:35.360
is to be given up, absolutely. If Mother has
to say, She’ll say it. Why should you communicate;

37:37.110 --> 37:42.370
why should you say? I never asked you to say
that.

37:42.370 --> 37:49.370
Understanding Sahaja Yoga is very simple,
extremely simple, when you understand one

37:57.530 --> 38:04.530
thing - that you have to have your innocence
intact. Now, “How to get to innocence?”

38:07.950 --> 38:14.950
people will say. How to get to innocence?
It’s a vicious circle. How to get to innocence?

38:15.090 --> 38:18.080
– It’s a very vicious circle. We have
to get to innocence, through what? Your ego

38:18.080 --> 38:22.290
or superego? How will you get to innocence?
Mother says, “Don’t raise your Kundalini.”

38:22.290 --> 38:27.160
I mean, I am sitting here - people are just
doing like that. What’s happening? I am

38:27.160 --> 38:34.160
sitting here - your Kundalini is up there
on your head. What are you raising? Now how

38:36.940 --> 38:43.940
to manage is the problem. Very simple it is.
In the beginning I said, “Let your Guru

38:49.910 --> 38:56.910
reside in your heart.” How to manage – why?
Let Mother manage. Mother is managing me.

39:00.180 --> 39:07.180
Keep it at that. Your right side will clear.
Your left side will clear when you say, “Nobody

39:16.350 --> 39:22.290
can manage me but Mother can manage me”
- two things together. Things will work out.

39:22.290 --> 39:27.469
Thank God you have somebody like Me, who is
sitting here, who can say so. Think of those

39:27.469 --> 39:32.800
who never had anyone to tell them, or to be
in their presence to say that I can manage

39:32.800 --> 39:39.800
this, or you can manage that. That now you
can balance. Allow your Kundalini to grow.

39:45.060 --> 39:52.060
Everything works out. Like this house when
I purchased, or when they purchased, or who

39:55.650 --> 40:02.650
purchased - So many questions and complications
– How, how, how? But it’s worked; it’s

40:03.550 --> 40:10.550
there, quite intact; nothing has fallen off;
nothing has gone wrong. I had to shout once,

40:12.229 --> 40:19.229
all right. But let Me shout, you don’t start
shouting. As soon as I finish, they will take

40:26.440 --> 40:33.440
a loudspeaker, shout even louder. “Mother
said so, you are this, that.” I am saying

40:34.290 --> 40:41.290
about you, (to) whom are you preaching? But
only, you must know that when I tell you something,

40:42.459 --> 40:49.459
please do it; please do it. See because I
know quite a lot. Because I am Guru, your

40:51.880 --> 40:58.880
Guru; because I am the Guru of all the Gurus.
And those who is a real Guru, knows that my

41:00.969 --> 41:07.969
Mother knows everything. She is knowledge
Herself. If She says something, it means something.

41:13.989 --> 41:20.989
And even I may test you sometimes, doesn’t
matter. That’s how you become the Guru.

41:24.459 --> 41:31.459
Shivaji had a Guru called Ramadasa. In those
days, Gurus used to take lot of test of their

41:36.749 --> 41:42.330
disciples. I never took your test or anything.
But you are testing yourself, that’s all.

41:42.330 --> 41:49.330
And his Guru one day said that, “I think
I need the milk of a tigress. I have to drink

41:49.440 --> 41:56.440
the milk of a tigress.” Half of them died
and most of them didn’t hear it. Shivaji

42:01.160 --> 42:08.160
said, “All right. I’ll get you.” He
went in the jungles. He saw a tigress and

42:13.900 --> 42:20.900
there were little little, small little children
she had, and those cubs were lying on the

42:24.930 --> 42:31.930
side. He went and he just said ‘Namaskar’
[Hindi word meaning salutation] to her. (He)

42:32.550 --> 42:38.820
Said, “My Guru wants your milk,” that’s
all – because Gurus are ‘Parabrahma’

42:38.820 --> 42:42.979
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning God Almighty], their
orders are listened to by the ‘Parabrahma’.

42:42.979 --> 42:49.979
“My Guru, Shri Ramadasa, wants your milk.
So please, will you give me your milk?”

42:52.100 --> 42:59.100
So nicely she got up, stood up before him.
He milked her and took that milk for his Guru.

43:06.219 --> 43:13.219
This is what it is. Have you understood the
meaning of ‘Gurupada’ [Hindi/Sanskrit

43:13.870 --> 43:17.380
meaning the status/position of Guru]?

43:17.380 --> 43:24.380
When you become absolutely one with the desires
of your Guru, you achieve the position of

43:27.380 --> 43:34.380
a Guru. But if you still have certain ideas
about it, then Shri Ramadasa has said that

43:39.469 --> 43:43.940
then God ‘Alpadhrishtapaye … [not clear]’
sees your little courage [?] - “All right,

43:43.940 --> 43:50.940
go ahead. Break your heads and then come back.
I’ll fix them up.” So it is important

43:52.300 --> 43:59.300
that we should do one thing seriously – is
to take your Mother very seriously when it

44:02.830 --> 44:04.110
comes to some request.

44:04.110 --> 44:09.540
Of course, in English language I always say,
“Please, will you do it?” Or I may even

44:09.540 --> 44:15.610
say, “I am afraid will you do it?” But
that should make no difference. Other day

44:15.610 --> 44:20.540
only, when we were coming for Cardiff, I said
that the first class will be coming on the

44:20.540 --> 44:24.950
other side. But everybody at the platform
said, “No, it is coming on the other side.”

44:24.950 --> 44:30.800
I said, “All right.” We sat down, and
then they announced that the first class is

44:30.800 --> 44:37.170
coming on this side. So we all again walked
back. It’s all right for those people, but

44:37.170 --> 44:44.170
what about you? Many a times you have seen.
And at the asking of a Guru, if something

44:45.370 --> 44:52.370
goes wrong also, it should be always accepted
as the law of the Divine - because, Guru is

44:53.880 --> 45:00.880
the giver of the law of the Divine, not the
worldly laws. The law of the Divine He gives

45:02.080 --> 45:06.780
you. The law of the Divine you understand,
then you have to surrender to that law of

45:06.780 --> 45:13.780
the Divine, and that’s how you will become
masters of that law.

45:16.670 --> 45:20.660
Today, for a Guru Puja, I can go on talking
to you. But today, I would request you to

45:20.660 --> 45:27.660
understand that whilst surrendering, as Islam
is called, was so important -
that if God is your Guru, let Him guide you;

45:45.700 --> 45:52.700
Thy will be done. Let us not guide ourselves
and also, sometimes they try to guide the

45:59.070 --> 46:06.070
Guru as well. Then the Guru plays tricks,
and then you fall into the trap of tricks,

46:06.570 --> 46:10.979
and then you find it’s too much.

46:10.979 --> 46:17.979
It is better to listen to what the Guru is
telling you, and better to do it. Whatever

46:20.940 --> 46:27.940
the Guru says is all right. Gurus can ask
you anything. I mean, I am quite a nice Guru.

46:30.150 --> 46:37.150
Like, this Ramadasa himself asked his disciples
that, “I have got a very bad, septic, big

46:42.749 --> 46:49.749
boil and please try to suck it out because
it is full of pus.” Imagine. So they didn’t

46:55.259 --> 47:01.739
know what to do, you know. How to suck the
pus of the Guru is too much. But Shivaji came

47:01.739 --> 47:07.370
forward. He took down his hat, sat down next
to him, started sucking. People said, “How

47:07.370 --> 47:14.370
is it?” Said, “It’s very sweet, very
nice.” Actually, he had tied a mango there.

47:18.670 --> 47:25.670
That is how the Gurus took lot of tests. I
have never taken your test, and you do not

47:42.830 --> 47:47.840
take the tests of others. Leave them to Me,
I’ll manage all of them one by one. Whatever

47:47.840 --> 47:54.840
has to happen happens. In Sahaja Yoga, to
think that 100% will be rich, healthy, wealthy

47:56.699 --> 48:03.699
and on top of the world, is a nonsense. If
we become very wealthy, then there will be

48:08.800 --> 48:15.800
recession because others will be very poor.
If we become very healthy then nobody will

48:19.540 --> 48:26.540
come near us; if we all look like wrestlers,
who will come near us? If we become very wise,

48:29.219 --> 48:35.440
then people will be frightened of such wise
people; nothing will… they cannot understand

48:35.440 --> 48:42.440
anything, it will go over their heads. So
let us be in the center. We should be wealthy,

48:42.850 --> 48:49.850
but not too much; we should be healthy, but
not too much; we should be wise, but not too

48:51.360 --> 48:58.360
much. So far, so good – that’s how we
should move.

48:58.499 --> 49:05.280
So we keep to our ‘Maryadas’ and we become
beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial

49:05.280 --> 49:12.280
to others, who will be able to get others
to us, who will be able to project an image

49:17.390 --> 49:24.390
of magnetic personalities. And this is what
we have to do. If we try to show off in any

49:27.080 --> 49:33.040
way - like I have seen people try to show
off unnecessarily – there is no need. Just

49:33.040 --> 49:40.040
be in the background. If you are very much
in the background, just be in the foreground.

49:44.270 --> 49:51.270
Try to balance yourself. Try to watch yourself
and guide yourself and tell yourself, “Become

49:52.630 --> 49:59.630
your own Gurus.” Judge yourself how far
you are in the center, how far you are growing,

50:00.709 --> 50:07.199
how much growth have you achieved. Are you
still attached to small things here and there?

50:07.199 --> 50:14.199
Are you still bothered about small things?
– “Mother, I should have got 80% marks,

50:15.420 --> 50:22.420
I have got only 75% marks.” Oh God. Because
he got 75% marks, there is something good

50:24.330 --> 50:31.070
has to come out. He has to learn a lesson,
maybe. Or maybe that he has to take some other

50:31.070 --> 50:38.070
course. Maybe something that is good for his
ascent has to work out – is to be seen if

50:38.540 --> 50:45.540
you have to be Gurus. If you can’t see that,
how can others see that? This is to be realized.

50:47.699 --> 50:54.699
Not to be put in the mind, but to be realized
in the heart. In the realm of your heart you

51:00.640 --> 51:07.640
have to realize it; you have to understand
it in the realm of your heart. Nice that we

51:10.180 --> 51:17.180
are in England, the heart of the universe,
that we are talking about opening our hearts.

51:21.699 --> 51:28.699
If you have to put Me there, is the ocean
of love, and to contain this ocean of love,

51:28.729 --> 51:35.729
you have to have a very, very large heart
– bigger than your personalities, bigger

52:07.989 --> 52:14.989
than your countries, bigger than this world,
bigger than this universe.

52:50.600 --> 52:57.600
May God bless you.

53:06.090 --> 53:13.090
End of transcript.
