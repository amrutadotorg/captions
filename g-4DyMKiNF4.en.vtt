00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:18.634
Today, it’s a great day that you are here
to worship your Guru in the realm of the heart

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:32.388
of the universe. If we can do that in our
domain of the heart, we don’t have to do

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.150
anything else.

00:00:38.678 --> 00:01:03.476
Today, also, I feel I have to tell you about
Sahaja Yoga and its value, which is related

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:17.376
to other Yogas which were accepted in the
olden days all over the world. They called

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:32.746
it, one, as the Yoga – not Sahaja Yoga,
Yoga. It started with various types of practices

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:37.048
of ‘Ashtanga’ [Sanskrit/Hindi meaning
‘having eight stages/parts’] Yogas – eightfold

00:01:37.048 --> 00:01:51.668
yogas – with a Guru. And one had to go through
lots of hardships. Nobody who was married

00:01:51.758 --> 00:02:03.288
was allowed into that Ashtanga Yoga, and they
had to give up their families, give up their

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:29.250
relationships. They had to become
absolutely without any attachments, to go
to a Guru. All their property, all their possessions

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:39.231
were given up. Not to the Guru as is done
in modern times, but given away. And this

00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:42.161
was called as Yoga.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:58.627
The another style was called as Sankhya. Sankhya
is where all your life you have to gather

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:16.943
things with detachment, and then to distribute
them completely and take to a Guru, in a way

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:37.940
completely surrendered, and then get realization.
Sankhya was the left-sided behavior. And the

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:50.871
Yoga was the right-sided. Where the Gayatri
Mantra was used was the Sankhya. Because they

00:03:50.917 --> 00:04:04.550
were left-sided, they used to use Gayatri
Mantra. They went so much to the left side

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:12.851
- that is to gather things, to gather possessions,
to gather properties, to gather all kinds

00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:24.651
of friends and relations and societies - that
they were afraid that they may be completely

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:37.933
lost into all those things. They would go
to Gayatri, the Mantra of Gayatri which teaches

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:49.054
you the essences of all our Chakras – the
centers. I have told about this before also

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:56.178
– ‘Bhu’, ‘Bhurv’, ‘Swaha’. ‘Bhu’
stands for the essence or the ‘Bija’ of

00:04:56.313 --> 00:05:07.883
the ‘Mooladhara’; ‘Bhuv’ for the universe
that is created that is Swadisthana’s ‘Bija’;

00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:24.176
‘Swaha’ is the ‘Bija’ of the Nabhi;
‘Manah’ is the essence of the Heart Chakra.

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:33.857
Then, ‘Janah’ is the people, collectivity,
is the essence or the ‘Bija’ of the Vishuddhi

00:05:33.957 --> 00:05:44.705
Chakra. Then, ‘Tapah’ is the one where
you go into ‘tapasya’, into renunciation,

00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:57.545
into hardships – is the essence of the Agnya
Chakra. And then the ‘Satya’ is the truth,

00:05:57.618 --> 00:06:09.298
is the essence of the Sahasrara – not the
truth that we think as truth, but the truth

00:06:09.297 --> 00:06:23.973
that is expressed in our central nervous system.
So, this is discovered at the seventh stage

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:34.516
of the Sahasrara. So the people who did Sankhya
were, sort of, not so much respected as spiritual

00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:41.956
people, because they thought these are all
involved into worldly things and worldly possessions

00:06:42.038 --> 00:06:51.736
and worldly happenings. So, they were regarded
as something secondary. Or those who were

00:06:51.758 --> 00:07:02.488
yogis of the Gurus were regarded higher, because
they had already given up everything, and

00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:13.869
they have gone to a Guru giving up all the
things that they have. But here, these Gurus

00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:22.391
had a problem within themselves because they
found that those who came to them gave up

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:29.417
everything – no doubt – but still there
was lurking attachments. In their own ‘Ashramas’

00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:35.438
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning hermitages] they found,
these people had their own attachments to

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:43.688
things. Though outwardly they had given up,
but inside they had not given up. So, they

00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:51.600
were still sticking on to these ideas that,
‘Oh, its all right. But still we can have

00:07:51.707 --> 00:07:57.928
little things like that, doesn’t matter.’
Like that, there was little compromises going

00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:02.778
on. Like, as we have here nunneries and all
that. So both, in a way, were artificial.

00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:22.559
The one side, is the Sankhyas, were trying
to ascend with all the luggage they were carrying.

00:08:22.658 --> 00:08:31.140
And another were trying to descend with all
the ambitions of ascent.

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:46.330
So, it was a very funny thing in every aspect,
in both these styles of Yoga. As you can see

00:08:46.458 --> 00:08:55.390
that now, if you go to America you’ll find,
‘Oh God, what is this America? It’s not

00:08:55.478 --> 00:09:03.490
democracy, it’s demonocracy.’ But if you
go from that in the realm of another country

00:09:03.578 --> 00:09:12.748
like Russia, you find - what is this? You
are working here under complete pressures

00:09:12.777 --> 00:09:19.708
and fears. But as soon as a Russian comes
out of that country, he can become worse than

00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:27.462
an American. So what is this? One theory works
here, another theory works there. So which

00:09:27.478 --> 00:09:36.564
is the theory that is all right? Same you
find about religion. Say, a religion, which

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:43.258
believes in many Gods, like the Hindus, they
are also believing now into the ‘Bhoots’.

00:09:43.258 --> 00:09:56.045
And they are also following the path of possessions.
If you go to a temple, every temple has got

00:09:56.168 --> 00:10:07.467
nice arrangement for you to get possessed.
Or even a church, or a mosque – where God

00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:16.147
has to reside, you find suddenly you get attacked
and you come out absolutely puzzled about

00:10:16.268 --> 00:10:22.717
yourself, ending up into lunatic asylums.
So what sort of worshipping places are these,

00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:31.842
where you go to find God and you get the horrible
satanic forces acting on you? That’s why,

00:10:31.918 --> 00:10:44.165
in the modern times, people have become so
very confused. We do not find truth in anything

00:10:44.218 --> 00:10:54.718
– in any ideologies, any philosophies, anything
that started… say, Confusius started humanism,

00:10:54.818 --> 00:11:01.818
Socrates started another thing, Mohammad Saheb
started another thing. Like Mohammad Saheb

00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:10.108
said let us not worship God as an idol; let
us worship Him in the ‘Nirakara’, in the

00:11:10.258 --> 00:11:19.169
formless God. But you see the formless? How
they are killing each other now? I mean, after

00:11:19.238 --> 00:11:25.097
seeing the Muslim countries, you can’t believe
there could be any formless or formful God

00:11:25.097 --> 00:11:32.097
existing anywhere – all must have run away
- the way they are fighting. Then you see

00:11:32.298 --> 00:11:46.336
the Christian countries. Wherever they have
gone, they have tried to dominate other people

00:11:46.458 --> 00:12:02.294
who were not Christians, just as if they had
a right to do it because they were Christians.

00:12:02.378 --> 00:12:06.878
The Disciples of Christ, who said, “Forgive
them for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:12:06.878 --> 00:12:16.185
And I have to say the same for all the Christians,
“Forgive them for they do not know what

00:12:16.318 --> 00:12:23.217
they are doing.” And when you are shocked
at all these things, one must sit down and

00:12:23.217 --> 00:12:31.286
think what is to be done, what’s the problem
is.

00:12:31.358 --> 00:12:41.398
So, it is neither Sankhya nor Yoga; then what
is it you have to achieve? That is Sahaja

00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:50.330
Yoga. Sahaja Yog is a system in which first
you are not given a theory, but the light

00:12:50.438 --> 00:12:57.650
in your hand to see for yourself in which
both things look the same. For example, now

00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:11.685
you have got this beautiful house made for
your Mother, while your Mother doesn’t know

00:13:11.798 --> 00:13:21.368
how to get attached to even a pin. It’s
a funny situation.

00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:25.068
Everybody has to remind Me, “Mother it is
Your house.”

00:13:25.068 --> 00:13:26.267
“Oh I see.”

00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:42.897
And I have to be reminded I must thank you
all, specially the English, specially the

00:13:42.928 --> 00:13:53.278
leaders of English Sahaja yogis, for making
full effort to get this house. But then, I

00:13:53.258 --> 00:14:00.188
think why should I thank? It’s not mine,
it’s theirs – and that’s what it is.

00:14:00.758 --> 00:14:14.329
So a new type of confusion starts, and that’s
what I felt that this confusion is very sweet

00:14:14.407 --> 00:14:27.061
and beautiful. It’s a fact that nothing
belongs to us, but every thing belongs to

00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:33.918
us. When I think about how beautifully you
have done this place, it belongs to Me, all

00:14:33.918 --> 00:14:59.472
right; this house belongs to Me; England belongs
to Me and above all, the whole world belongs

00:14:59.502 --> 00:15:28.382
to Me. That’s how we see Sankhya and Yoga
become one in Sahaja Yoga. And it’s said

00:15:28.632 --> 00:15:35.632
that when you see Sankhya and Yoga as one,
then only ‘Sapaashati’ – that’s the

00:15:35.812 --> 00:15:39.072
one who sees; that’s the one is the witness.

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:53.222
So, for normal people it could be that how
is it your Mother is supposed to be a Guru

00:15:53.312 --> 00:15:59.962
and She wears all ornaments? But what to do?
She’s also a Mother and She is also a Goddess.

00:15:59.962 --> 00:16:13.862
Another confusion. How to make these two things
be? You see a Guru has to be a very angry

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:19.802
person, wearing only single dress either upwards
or downwards, I don’t know how, with a big

00:16:19.802 --> 00:16:34.693
thick rod in the hand, never smiling – laughing
no question – smiling. And the Gurus have

00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:43.215
to be very long faced, developing big, big
beards, and no ladies allowed. In such a situation,

00:16:43.341 --> 00:17:01.967
where the women are not to be seen at all,
I mean I shouldn’t even see My face - it’s

00:17:02.062 --> 00:17:12.238
like that. There is a big discussion in all
the scriptures - not scriptures, I would say

00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:26.941
the critiques, whether a woman should be allowed
to do the spiritual practices or not – imagine.

00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:34.131
Not only among Christians, you’ll be surprised,
even in Indian scriptures - whether is woman

00:17:34.302 --> 00:17:45.512
is allowed or not to do spiritual practices.
Now when your Mother is a woman and She is

00:17:45.702 --> 00:17:59.502
your Guru, what will you do? This is another
confusion because it is wrong, the whole thing

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:13.534
is falsehood, based on no basis at all. You
may try anything to say that women are not

00:18:13.572 --> 00:18:27.604
meant for spiritual life, try any argument,
it fails. The other day I met one big John

00:18:27.812 --> 00:18:40.105
in a University, big fellow, I might say really
hard nut, and he started saying, “We Christians

00:18:40.212 --> 00:18:45.847
cannot accept a woman to be God.”

00:18:45.982 --> 00:18:47.522
I said, “Why?”

00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:50.422
“Because…”

00:18:58.092 --> 00:19:19.051
So to put all these upside-down stories right,
your Mother had to come on this earth as a

00:19:19.052 --> 00:19:32.222
Guru. I got to this point out of one little
confusion I had about Myself. The other day,

00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:37.811
somebody was after My life that I should buy
a bracelet. I said, “I have no money anymore;

00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:39.089
I don’t want to buy.”

00:19:39.238 --> 00:19:41.049
“All right we will give it in Puja.”

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:43.198
I said, “But now there is only Guru Puja.”

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:45.559
Said, “All right, we will give it in Guru
Puja.”

00:19:45.709 --> 00:19:50.899
I said, “To buy a bracelet in Guru Puja
is something funny I have done.”

00:19:51.199 --> 00:19:57.929
After all, in a Guru Puja you don’t give
a bracelet to your Guru, do you? You can give,

00:19:57.988 --> 00:20:09.515
say, a big rod; or you might give him a sandalwood
‘Khada’ - what is it called - ‘Chappals’,

00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:17.705
or you may give him a shawl. But here it is…
I have asked… all right give it in Guru

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:29.377
Puja. What was the reason? And I became aware
of My own confusion and I thought of it. I

00:20:29.485 --> 00:20:37.369
said, “This is what it is, that it has to
happen this way that, on a Guru Puja you have

00:20:37.465 --> 00:20:47.115
to give a bracelet to your Guru.” Let us
change it over. The whole thing has to be

00:20:47.285 --> 00:20:58.320
brought up this way that everything faces
reality. All these false ideas have to be

00:20:58.405 --> 00:21:05.953
given up. Like, if you have a carpet upside-down,
the whole design is upside-down. But, if you

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:14.203
put the carpet right, everything falls in
line. And that’s why you needed a Mother

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:24.763
to give you realization, and a Guru as a Mother
to teach you that for ascent of God nobody

00:21:24.855 --> 00:21:30.165
can be prohibited.

00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:37.165
That is how the Sahaja Yoga today is working
out. In all directions, if you find, to put

00:21:37.205 --> 00:21:48.365
all upside-down things into right direction,
to expose it to reality, to bring all real

00:21:48.494 --> 00:22:08.178
values, to abolish all rotten value systems,
all political, economic systems, all spiritual

00:22:08.235 --> 00:22:22.334
theologies, all psychological and all such
nonsensical ideas into its proper direction.

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:37.635
How in one incarnation it has worked out,
you can imagine. How in one incarnation all

00:22:37.695 --> 00:22:42.004
these ideas have been put right.

00:22:42.004 --> 00:22:49.526
Another idea exists, among Hindus, that if
you are a religious people, you should be

00:22:49.585 --> 00:22:57.926
a vegetarian. All the Brahmins believe this,
and even the non-Brahmins. But we had a Brahmin

00:22:58.014 --> 00:23:04.695
working in one of the places where I was living,
and they said that for Mother we have to give

00:23:04.695 --> 00:23:12.841
meat, She doesn’t eat anything else. She
has to eat proteins. She said, “Yes,yes,

00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:17.315
Of course. For a Mother, She must have.”
Whether it’s a Brahmin or a non-Brahmin,

00:23:17.315 --> 00:23:24.315
all understand that Mother has to eat proteins.
Because She has to drink the blood of all

00:23:24.514 --> 00:23:28.235
these ‘rakshasas’ [Hindi meaning demons],
how can She be vegetarian? And if She has

00:23:28.235 --> 00:23:46.863
to kill so many devils, how can She be non-violent?
So the contrast that you see in the description

00:23:46.915 --> 00:24:06.239
of the Mother - that She is the one who is
the most furious personality when it comes

00:24:06.243 --> 00:24:15.063
to the killing of the people who are of the
negative land, who are trying to destroy Her

00:24:15.134 --> 00:24:23.067
creation, Her own children; and She is the
sweetest and the mildest person for Her own

00:24:23.154 --> 00:24:30.154
children. These two contrasts should be seen.
Even in animals you’ll find the same contrast,

00:24:30.384 --> 00:24:39.569
but very evident in an incarnation like this.
And today, through Sahaja Yoga, we have been

00:24:39.594 --> 00:24:45.373
able to prove that Sankhya and Yoga are the
same.

00:24:45.373 --> 00:24:52.024
Whether you collect things, whether you have
possessions or whether you give away, makes

00:24:52.024 --> 00:24:59.024
no difference to a person who is detached
from within. If you collect them for others,

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:09.554
even better. But if you collect for yourself
and then give away, that’s even much better.

00:25:09.604 --> 00:25:14.256
Because first you collect for yourself then
you think, “Oh it’s good for me, I will

00:25:14.287 --> 00:25:19.616
use this one for myself, will be a good idea”
- so the self is there - but then, that you

00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:25.846
give away. That means your detachment is complete.
Or the third personality could be like Me

00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:33.177
which just goes on collecting and
just goes on giving. Without thinking it collects

00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:40.026
and without thinking it gives because thinking
is not My job. That is one thing I have given

00:25:40.026 --> 00:25:51.076
up – is to think. I don’t want to think
– that’s your work, not Me. And without

00:25:51.126 --> 00:25:59.192
thinking, how many things we have achieved
through Sahaja Yoga. Yoga and Sankhya both

00:25:59.217 --> 00:26:10.167
are products of thinking, not products of
spontaneity. This house itself is a product

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:16.587
of spontaneity. I mean, as we call the English
as ‘Saablogs’, you see. So I took some

00:26:16.587 --> 00:26:21.807
‘Saablogs’ with Me around to see some
houses and they wanted to (see) some houses

00:26:21.807 --> 00:26:28.447
with some character – means something must
fall out, something must be crooked, this

00:26:28.447 --> 00:26:35.447
should not be straightforward. I said, “Now
please, I can’t bear all this crookedness.”

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:38.827
So, “No, no, but it has character.”

00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:44.287
I said, “Now, this kind of a crooked nose
I don’t want.” Straightforward it should

00:26:44.287 --> 00:26:52.607
be. So they were rather disappointed at Me.
And the ‘Saablog’ had some other ideas

00:26:52.887 --> 00:26:59.616
also that, say for example, if you go to,
say, to a place called Windmere, it’s a

00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:10.020
posh place; if you go to the North side, little
less; then if you go to the east, it’s useless

00:27:10.127 --> 00:27:18.510
– like that. I said, “Let’s go the north,
northest as far as we can go.” Because,

00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:26.101
you know, the Godess has to be ‘Dakshinamurthy’.
She has to be on the north side to be on the

00:27:26.157 --> 00:27:32.887
- Her eyes on the south. That’s the reason
She has to be… I mean we could not have

00:27:32.887 --> 00:27:37.616
been in Scotland – that would have been
too much for you. But that would have been

00:27:37.616 --> 00:27:46.163
the ideal for all of us because then our ‘Drishti’
is towards - our vision is towards the south

00:27:46.287 --> 00:27:58.672
and we see the whole universe under our own
beautiful visions. So that’s how, spontaneously,

00:27:58.756 --> 00:28:07.184
we found this place. And ‘Saablog’ were,
“Yes, No, No, Yes.” But spontaneously

00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:17.986
we got it. And then we found out it has a
history; then we found out its beautiful vibrations;

00:28:18.106 --> 00:28:25.606
then we found out the potential about it.
Whatever you get spontaneously, it is full

00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:27.567
of potentials.

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:38.089
On this point, I have to say a few words,
is important. I had to get - few points I

00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:51.100
have to say about spontaneity part which is
quite interesting – the way people think

00:28:51.197 --> 00:29:01.265
spontaneity works. Like, it’s mostly ego
part which says, ‘This is spontaneous,’

00:29:01.407 --> 00:29:13.000
with so many people. Specially the very old
Sahaja Yogis think they are authorities on

00:29:13.077 --> 00:29:19.557
spontaneity. Like, we had a land in Vaitarna.
So one of the older ones went there and he

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:27.054
said, “This land is vibrating and this is
not vibrating.” So everybody accepted, ‘All

00:29:27.096 --> 00:29:33.876
right, all right, all right.’ Then they
said, “In this part of the land nobody should

00:29:33.876 --> 00:29:43.060
eat their food.” Now, from where does this
knowledge come? Eating food is not a sin,

00:29:43.106 --> 00:29:52.051
is it? As if it is a sin that you are eating
food in there. Then religiously they follow

00:29:52.116 --> 00:30:01.324
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, z and again a, b,
c, d of Sahaja Yoga to such an extent, ‘ki’

00:30:01.457 --> 00:30:07.116
[Hindi meaning ‘that’] I start thinking
now they have become another fanatic Sahaja

00:30:07.116 --> 00:30:14.444
Yogis. Fanaticism is against Sahaja Yoga – absolutely.
Now they will ask, “How many times we should

00:30:14.476 --> 00:30:25.054
say this ‘Mantra’?” Then I say, “Zero
times.”

00:30:25.177 --> 00:30:39.024
“How many drops we should put, the ghee,
in our nose?” Then I say, “A full jug.”

00:30:49.057 --> 00:30:56.057
Then, “Oh, I should not have gone from the
left side, I should have gone from the right

00:30:56.096 --> 00:30:56.787
side.”

00:30:56.787 --> 00:31:00.846
Then, I would say, “You just jump up.”

00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:09.027
You have to be like children. But the ideas
are so settled down in Sahaja Yoga, now it’s

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:16.067
so many years of course, but they should not
settle down. If they settle down, it’s not

00:31:16.277 --> 00:31:24.542
Sahaja; it’s not spontaneous. ‘If you
do this way, then it is wrong; that way, it’s

00:31:24.606 --> 00:31:31.606
wrong’ – nothing of the kind. Nothing
is wrong for you people. If you do anything

00:31:31.824 --> 00:31:37.356
wrong, your vibrations will be lost, finished.
What is there to be so cautious? Like, somebody

00:31:37.356 --> 00:31:40.267
said, “I don’t want to look at the cigarette.”
I said, “Why?”

00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:45.625
“Looking at it also is sinful.”

00:31:45.761 --> 00:31:48.061
I said, “Looking at it what happens?”

00:31:48.061 --> 00:31:50.381
“Then I feel like smoking.”

00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:54.470
So I said, “Better smoke once for all.”

00:31:54.470 --> 00:32:03.852
Or, “I cannot hold a wine bottle in my hand.”

00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:04.820
“Why?”

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.291
“No, holding the wine bottle is sinful.”

00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:25.886
I mean, you can swim in the wine. So this
kind of understanding should be there. Though

00:32:25.926 --> 00:32:29.487
I have always said that if I say one thing,
you will clinch on to it. So I always say

00:32:29.487 --> 00:32:36.057
the other side of it - that don’t stick
on to something; Sahaja Yoga is not for sticking

00:32:36.057 --> 00:32:41.357
on to something. Like somebody who had learnt
certain say, lessons about Sahaja Yoga in

00:32:41.357 --> 00:32:48.357
the beginning of it, certain Mantras they
had learnt, and still they are sticking on

00:32:48.597 --> 00:32:55.307
to the same step. No, no, no, no – you have
to go ahead. This is just a staircase. Don’t

00:32:55.307 --> 00:33:05.796
get stuck at a point. We have had so many
such cases here. People get really outworn

00:33:05.837 --> 00:33:12.837
as they say. They will go on telling you so
many nonsensical ideas – “You see, if

00:33:12.977 --> 00:33:19.737
you do like this, then this happens.” First
of all, you don’t give ideas to others.

00:33:19.737 --> 00:33:25.097
That’s one thing - if you decide that we
don’t give ideas about what’s wrong with

00:33:25.122 --> 00:33:29.587
another person, half of your job is done.
Because you don’t have to do any job, as

00:33:29.655 --> 00:33:39.389
I don’t do. Anybody who comes, “You are
a ‘bhoot’.” You better have it. I get

00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:43.849
reports from others. They say that your Sahaja
Yogis are wicked people. I said, “Why?”

00:33:43.959 --> 00:33:49.388
“Oh, they tell you, ‘You are evil.’
They tell you, ‘You are possessed’, they

00:33:49.388 --> 00:33:56.138
tell you, ‘You are this, you are that’;
they are very wicked people.”

00:33:56.138 --> 00:34:03.822
I am really shocked to hear that Sahaja Yogis
- how can they be wicked? If somebody is suffering

00:34:03.852 --> 00:34:06.902
from something, in the phone they say, “Oh
you better have it. It’s good for you.”

00:34:06.902 --> 00:34:18.076
That’s not the way. We have to be not only
humble, very tactful and sweet to new people

00:34:18.132 --> 00:34:23.682
– if you want any more to come in. But if
you have decided not to have anymore, because

00:34:23.682 --> 00:34:29.531
you will have to put another marquee, then
I have nothing to say. But if you want others

00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:36.531
to come in, then it’s important that you
talk to them in a very sweet and beautiful

00:34:36.568 --> 00:34:44.382
language, the way they understand. Rudeness,
arrogance, showing off, is of no use. One

00:34:44.411 --> 00:34:54.491
should understand Sahaja Yoga is where you
are in complete enjoyment about it; you are

00:34:54.602 --> 00:34:59.212
just lost into that enjoyment. Where is the
time to remember how many times to give a

00:34:59.253 --> 00:35:07.983
‘Bandhan’ to yourself? What is the need
to give ‘Bandhan’ to yourself? It’s

00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:17.155
all a joke now for you, should be. A little
child sucks the milk from the bottle, all

00:35:17.172 --> 00:35:28.902
right, because it has no teeth. But what about
you people having that kind of a thing? It’s

00:35:28.892 --> 00:35:41.581
very childish and shows no growth at all.
Sahaja Yoga must grow within. You should not

00:35:41.692 --> 00:35:53.184
be, anymore, regarded as immature Sahaja Yogis.
I would say: a person who is a matured Sahaja

00:35:53.352 --> 00:36:06.482
Yogi is the one who can combine so many things
together, with all beautiful lines, thin lines,

00:36:06.969 --> 00:36:14.264
thin ‘Maryadas’ [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning
code of conduct] maintained. But, you cannot

00:36:14.234 --> 00:36:16.214
do the other way round.

00:36:16.274 --> 00:36:20.114
For example, you shouldn’t say, “All right,
now I will be sweet. Then I will be angry;

00:36:20.194 --> 00:36:26.154
then I will be sweet; then I’ll be like
this; then I’ll be like that.” It will

00:36:26.234 --> 00:36:33.234
be a hotchpotch. It is a funny personality
you see - suddenly I get angry, like that

00:36:33.394 --> 00:36:36.823
[facial expression?], and then I [presumably
Mother demonstrates with facial expression].

00:36:39.253 --> 00:36:42.934
People will think you are doing ‘Bharatnatyam’
[a form of Indian classical dance] or something

00:36:42.994 --> 00:36:54.364
like that. Showing all your moods – in five
minutes you show ten moods. This is the growth

00:36:54.575 --> 00:37:02.905
within you, which will show. So, we have to
have our growth, and for growth, let us be

00:37:03.105 --> 00:37:13.051
silent within. Let us not react to others
- “This person is like that, that person

00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:22.653
is like that.” What about yourself? Also
there… other ways. Like, I tell somebody

00:37:22.762 --> 00:37:28.811
that, you see, you have this problem. So that
person immediately goes to the second person

00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:32.341
and says, “You see, Mother told me that
you too have this problem, better look after

00:37:32.331 --> 00:37:37.182
it.” I didn’t tell that person; I told
you. Keep it to yourself. So, ‘Mother says’

00:37:37.192 --> 00:37:45.784
is to be given up, absolutely. If Mother has
to say, She’ll say it. Why should you communicate;

00:37:45.942 --> 00:37:53.928
why should you say? I never asked you to say
that.

00:37:55.748 --> 00:38:06.811
Understanding Sahaja Yoga is very simple,
extremely simple, when you understand one

00:38:06.881 --> 00:38:17.161
thing - that you have to have your innocence
intact. Now, “How to get to innocence?”

00:38:17.301 --> 00:38:24.301
people will say. How to get to innocence?
It’s a vicious circle. How to get to innocence?

00:38:24.441 --> 00:38:27.431
– It’s a very vicious circle. We have
to get to innocence, through what? Your ego

00:38:27.431 --> 00:38:35.031
or superego? How will you get to innocence?
Mother says, “Don’t raise your Kundalini.”

00:38:35.101 --> 00:38:39.971
I mean, I am sitting here - people are just
doing like that. What’s happening? I am

00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:49.605
sitting here - your Kundalini is up there
on your head. What are you raising? Now how

00:38:49.751 --> 00:38:57.373
to manage is the problem. Very simple it is.
In the beginning I said, “Let your Guru

00:38:57.433 --> 00:39:08.943
reside in your heart.” How to manage – why?
Let Mother manage. Mother is managing me.

00:39:10.208 --> 00:39:25.139
Keep it at that. Your right side will clear.
Your left side will clear when you say, “Nobody

00:39:25.168 --> 00:39:31.108
can manage me but Mother can manage me”
- two things together. Things will work out.

00:39:31.108 --> 00:39:36.287
Thank God you have somebody like Me, who is
sitting here, who can say so. Think of those

00:39:36.287 --> 00:39:41.618
who never had anyone to tell them, or to be
in their presence to say that I can manage

00:39:41.618 --> 00:39:53.728
this, or you can manage that. That now you
can balance. Allow your Kundalini to grow.

00:39:53.878 --> 00:40:00.878
Everything works out. Like this house when
I purchased, or when they purchased, or who

00:40:00.928 --> 00:40:13.358
purchased - So many questions and complications
– How, how, how? But it’s worked; it’s

00:40:13.448 --> 00:40:28.417
there, quite intact; nothing has fallen off;
nothing has gone wrong. I had to shout once,

00:40:28.516 --> 00:40:35.106
all right. But let Me shout, you don’t start
shouting. As soon as I finish, they will take

00:40:35.176 --> 00:40:42.176
a loudspeaker, shout even louder. “Mother
said so, you are this, that.” I am saying

00:40:42.196 --> 00:40:49.722
about you, (to) whom are you preaching? But
only, you must know that when I tell you something,

00:40:49.772 --> 00:40:59.121
please do it; please do it. See because I
know quite a lot. Because I am Guru, your

00:40:59.193 --> 00:41:08.131
Guru; because I am the Guru of all the Gurus.
And those who is a real Guru, knows that my

00:41:08.282 --> 00:41:24.112
Mother knows everything. She is knowledge
Herself. If She says something, it means something.

00:41:24.192 --> 00:41:33.962
And even I may test you sometimes, doesn’t
matter. That’s how you become the Guru.

00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:44.220
Shivaji had a Guru called Ramadasa. In those
days, Gurus used to take lot of test of their

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:49.861
disciples. I never took your test or anything.
But you are testing yourself, that’s all.

00:41:49.861 --> 00:41:56.861
And his Guru one day said that, “I think
I need the milk of a tigress. I have to drink

00:41:56.971 --> 00:42:13.515
the milk of a tigress.” Half of them died
and most of them didn’t hear it. Shivaji

00:42:13.576 --> 00:42:23.855
said, “All right. I’ll get you.” He
went in the jungles. He saw a tigress and

00:42:23.906 --> 00:42:35.427
there were little little, small little children
she had, and those cubs were lying on the

00:42:35.487 --> 00:42:38.487
side. He went and he just said ‘Namaskar’
[Hindi word meaning salutation] to her. (He)

00:42:38.547 --> 00:42:48.447
Said, “My Guru wants your milk,” that’s
all – because Gurus are ‘Parabrahma’

00:42:48.511 --> 00:42:52.670
[Hindi/Sanskrit meaning God Almighty], their
orders are listened to by the ‘Parabrahma’.

00:42:52.755 --> 00:42:59.755
“My Guru, Shri Ramadasa, wants your milk.
So please, will you give me your milk?”

00:42:59.815 --> 00:43:12.815
So nicely she got up, stood up before him.
He milked her and took that milk for his Guru.

00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:21.476
This is what it is. Have you understood the
meaning of ‘Gurupada’ [Hindi/Sanskrit

00:43:21.585 --> 00:43:25.095
meaning the status/position of Guru]?

00:43:25.095 --> 00:43:37.305
When you become absolutely one with the desires
of your Guru, you achieve the position of

00:43:37.355 --> 00:43:49.335
a Guru. But if you still have certain ideas
about it, then Shri Ramadasa has said that

00:43:49.444 --> 00:43:53.915
then God ‘alpa dhrishtipa hai’
sees your little courage [?] - “All right,

00:43:53.915 --> 00:44:00.915
go ahead. Break your heads and then come back.
I’ll fix them up.” So it is important

00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:11.380
that we should do one thing seriously – is
to take your Mother very seriously when it

00:44:11.504 --> 00:44:12.784
comes to some request.

00:44:12.784 --> 00:44:18.214
Of course, in English language I always say,
“Please, will you do it?” Or I may even

00:44:18.214 --> 00:44:24.284
say, “I am afraid will you do it?” But
that should make no difference. Other day

00:44:24.284 --> 00:44:29.214
only, when we were coming for Cardiff, I said
that the first class will be coming on the

00:44:29.214 --> 00:44:33.624
other side. But everybody at the platform
said, “No, it is coming on the other side.”

00:44:33.624 --> 00:44:39.474
I said, “All right.” We sat down, and
then they announced that the first class is

00:44:39.474 --> 00:44:45.844
coming on this side. So we all again walked
back. It’s all right for those people, but

00:44:45.844 --> 00:44:52.844
what about you? Many a times you have seen.
And at the asking of a Guru, if something

00:44:52.904 --> 00:45:02.443
goes wrong also, it should be always accepted
as the law of the Divine - because, Guru is

00:45:02.554 --> 00:45:09.554
the giver of the law of the Divine, not the
worldly laws. The law of the Divine He gives

00:45:09.633 --> 00:45:15.454
you. The law of the Divine you understand,
then you have to surrender to that law of

00:45:15.454 --> 00:45:22.454
the Divine, and that’s how you will become
masters of that law.

00:45:22.529 --> 00:45:28.940
Today, for a Guru Puja, I can go on talking
to you. But today, I would request you to

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:52.635
understand that why surrendering, as Islam
is called, was so important -
that if God is your Guru, let Him guide you;

00:45:53.850 --> 00:46:07.357
Thy will be done. Let us not guide ourselves
and also, sometimes they try to guide the

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:14.430
Guru as well. Then the Guru plays tricks,
and then you fall into the trap of tricks,

00:46:14.527 --> 00:46:19.339
and then you find it’s too much.

00:46:19.339 --> 00:46:29.207
It is better to listen to what the Guru is
telling you, and better to do it. Whatever

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:38.341
the Guru says is all right. Gurus can ask
you anything. I mean, I am quite a nice Guru.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:51.030
Like, this Ramadasa himself asked his disciples
that, “I have got a very bad, septic, big

00:46:51.109 --> 00:47:03.508
boil and please try to suck it out because
it is full of pus.” Imagine. So they didn’t

00:47:03.619 --> 00:47:10.099
know what to do, you know. How to suck the
pus of the Guru is too much. But Shivaji came

00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:15.730
forward. He took down his hat, sat down next
to him, started sucking. People said, “How

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:25.813
is it?” Said, “It’s very sweet, very
nice.” Actually, he had tied a mango there.

00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:47.809
That is how the Gurus took lot of tests. I
have never taken your test, and you do not

00:47:47.901 --> 00:47:52.911
take the tests of others. Leave them to Me,
I’ll manage all of them one by one. Whatever

00:47:52.911 --> 00:48:07.141
has to happen happens. In Sahaja Yoga, to
think that 100% will be rich, healthy, wealthy

00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:19.282
and on top of the world, is a nonsense. If
we become very wealthy, then there will be

00:48:19.342 --> 00:48:30.002
recession because others will be very poor.
If we become very healthy then nobody will

00:48:30.082 --> 00:48:39.448
come near us; if we all look like wrestlers,
who will come near us? If we become very wise,

00:48:39.761 --> 00:48:45.982
then people will be frightened of such wise
people; nothing will… they cannot understand

00:48:45.982 --> 00:48:52.982
anything, it will go over their heads. So
let us be in the center. We should be wealthy,

00:48:53.392 --> 00:48:58.479
but not too much; we should be healthy, but
not too much; we should be wise, but not too

00:48:58.529 --> 00:49:06.896
much. So far, so good – that’s how we
should move.

00:49:07.128 --> 00:49:13.909
So we keep to our ‘Maryadas’ and we become
beautiful Sahaja Yogis, who will be congenial

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:24.568
to others, who will be able to get others
to us, who will be able to project an image

00:49:25.188 --> 00:49:35.611
of magnetic personalities. And this is what
we have to do. If we try to show off in any

00:49:35.709 --> 00:49:41.669
way - like I have seen people try to show
off unnecessarily – there is no need. Just

00:49:41.669 --> 00:49:48.669
be in the background. If you are very much
in the background, just be in the foreground.

00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:56.983
Try to balance yourself. Try to watch yourself
and guide yourself and tell yourself, “Become

00:49:57.093 --> 00:50:10.653
your own Gurus.” Judge yourself how far
you are in the center, how far you are growing,

00:50:10.768 --> 00:50:17.258
how much growth have you achieved. Are you
still attached to small things here and there?

00:50:17.258 --> 00:50:24.258
Are you still bothered about small things?
– “Mother, I should have got 80% marks,

00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:34.226
I have got only 75% marks.” Oh God. Because
he got 75% marks, there is something good

00:50:34.389 --> 00:50:41.129
has to come out. He has to learn a lesson,
maybe. Or maybe that he has to take some other

00:50:41.129 --> 00:50:48.129
course. Maybe something that is good for his
ascent has to work out – is to be seen if

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:57.598
you have to be Gurus. If you can’t see that,
how can others see that? This is to be realized.

00:50:57.758 --> 00:51:09.480
Not to be put in the mind, but to be realized
in the heart. In the realm of your heart you

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:18.710
have to realize it; you have to understand
it in the realm of your heart. Nice that we

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:30.239
are in England, the heart of the universe,
that we are talking about opening our hearts.

00:51:30.659 --> 00:51:37.659
If you have to put Me there, is the ocean
of love, and to contain this ocean of love,

00:51:37.689 --> 00:51:43.002
you have to have a very, very large heart
– bigger than your personalities, bigger

00:51:43.092 --> 00:51:50.092
than your countries, bigger than this world,
bigger than this universe.

00:51:50.254 --> 00:51:53.514
May God bless you.

00:52:05.744 --> 00:52:12.744
