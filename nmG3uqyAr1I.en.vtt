WEBVTT

00:04.325 --> 00:11.182
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesh.

00:13.158 --> 00:22.194
I think I have told you a lot about Him and
His nature,

00:22.395 --> 00:27.515
but still so many of us have not yet
realized

00:27.716 --> 00:33.044
what are His powers, and what He wants.

00:40.404 --> 00:46.202
First and foremost thing is that to respect
Shri Ganesha

00:46.403 --> 00:52.343
is to understand the importance
of chastity.

00:52.544 --> 01:00.628
Chastity is not only for the women, it is
more for the men to observe.

01:00.829 --> 01:07.510
If you have self-respect, in the real sense
of the word,

01:07.711 --> 01:11.357
you will take to chastity without
any difficulties.

01:11.558 --> 01:19.801
But if you have no self-respect, then you
run after something which is very low,

01:20.002 --> 01:25.713
of a very degrading quality.

01:26.229 --> 01:32.567
So it’s very important that chastity must
be respected,

01:32.768 --> 01:38.981
must be understood, and must be imbibed.

01:41.222 --> 01:47.951
This habit of not observing the proper
protocol

01:48.152 --> 01:55.479
of the chastity develops from childhood,
and we have to be very careful,

01:55.680 --> 02:04.798
when we are in a Ganesha state we should
not take to such horrible things.

02:04.999 --> 02:09.058
I don’t know from where people get
the ideas.

02:09.259 --> 02:18.055
As you see today in the whole world there’s
a crisis of chastity.

02:20.080 --> 02:27.879
In the West specially, we have heard
of so many cases of child abuse.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.102
In a temple of God one should not even take
the name

02:31.303 --> 02:35.658
of this dirty disease which has grabbed
the people.

02:35.859 --> 02:39.237
But in India we have never heard of it,
we don’t know.

02:39.438 --> 02:44.891
Of course, some of the men are very, very
ruined people

02:45.092 --> 02:50.969
and they can’t help it, unless and until
they are put into jail.

02:51.945 --> 02:58.039
But for a Sahaja yogi it is very important
to look after our chastities.

02:58.248 --> 03:01.411
As I told you yesterday, it is not
necessary

03:01.596 --> 03:05.619
to find a girl for yourself or a boy
for yourself.

03:05.820 --> 03:10.960
It’s also against the rules of chastity.

03:12.446 --> 03:17.380
I’m not saying that you should allow only
your parents to decide,

03:17.581 --> 03:23.424
but let the Sahaja Yoga decide, because
you are Sahajis.

03:23.625 --> 03:33.870
You are born after the image of Ganesha,
who ultimately becomes Christ.

03:34.071 --> 03:40.019
So what should be your attitude towards
chastity is very important.

03:41.960 --> 03:45.867
The most important thing, that

03:47.020 --> 03:55.319
if we get ruined on our chastity level
then Sahaja Yoga is very, very difficult,

03:55.520 --> 04:01.910
and it doesn’t give you that blessing
as you should have.

04:02.111 --> 04:07.847
You saw yesterday people from Romania
and also from Ukraine

04:08.048 --> 04:10.945
were singing so beautifully.

04:11.146 --> 04:18.613
One of the reasons is that basically they
are very, very humble people.

04:18.814 --> 04:24.848
They are humbled down, so much so that
they have given up nonsensical ideas

04:25.049 --> 04:29.422
about sex life and all that.

04:30.726 --> 04:37.715
So the humility will teach you that you are
not having your self-respect.

04:37.915 --> 04:44.257
In the Islam they have stressed a very big
importance on chastity, very much.

04:44.478 --> 04:49.518
And this was gone to such an extent that
Mohammed Sahib said that you can have

04:49.719 --> 04:58.128
five wives or four wives, but you don’t
have women who are prostitutes.

04:58.329 --> 05:06.905
Once this chastity starts leaving us,
we don’t mind anything under the sun.

05:07.106 --> 05:15.273
We have seen results of that working out
in many people who are very highly placed.

05:15.458 --> 05:19.795
And these highly placed people think that
they are something great,

05:19.996 --> 05:25.853
and they can overcome the binding of Jesus
Christ and they can do what they like,

05:26.054 --> 05:32.784
go on misbehaving with women who are
under them.

05:32.985 --> 05:38.034
They may do it secretly, they may do it
any way, but Ganesha watches that,

05:38.235 --> 05:42.483
and He punishes them for what they are
doing.

05:42.684 --> 05:46.516
It’s a terrible thing to go into these kind
of ventures,

05:46.717 --> 05:50.189
which are not the field of Sahaja yogis.

05:50.390 --> 05:54.030
Sahaja yogis have to first of all steady
their eyes,

05:54.231 --> 06:02.925
because it is concerned with the power
of Jesus Christ.

06:03.126 --> 06:07.219
But in all the Christian nations I have
seen people have wandering eyes –

06:07.420 --> 06:13.563
very surprising, when Christ is their
leader, they worship Christ,

06:13.764 --> 06:20.049
go to church, sing the praise of Christ,
and they have wandering eyes all over.

06:20.250 --> 06:27.790
These wandering eyes cannot be
representative of the chastity of Christ.

06:30.279 --> 06:43.395
Now the second point is that the power
of Ganesha can only be manifested

06:43.596 --> 06:48.861
if you are wise, because He is the giver
of wisdom.

06:49.062 --> 06:53.671
Now people don’t understand what is wisdom
is – this is the big problem.

06:53.893 --> 06:57.315
Intelligence, so-called, is not wisdom.

06:57.521 --> 07:01.491
It can make you a very cunning, very
aggressive,

07:01.692 --> 07:05.523
and sometimes very subtle person

07:05.724 --> 07:09.964
who can go on deceiving people, telling
lies, doing all kinds of things,

07:10.165 --> 07:16.368
and believing in themselves that they are
very, very successful.

07:16.569 --> 07:22.209
Success is never the criteria of a Sahaja
yogi.

07:22.465 --> 07:32.323
Success in Sahaja Yoga means very subtle
surrendering of oneself to Sahaja Yoga.

07:32.524 --> 07:40.107
That is seldom to be found unless and until
you meditate every day.

07:40.308 --> 07:43.447
It’s very important that you must meditate.

07:43.648 --> 07:47.642
Those who do not meditate will be lost
to Sahaja Yoga,

07:47.843 --> 07:53.449
because wisdom can only grow through
your inner inspiration.

07:53.799 --> 07:57.695
You can have this inner inspiration

08:00.254 --> 08:04.558
only if the power of Shri Ganesha
manifests.

08:04.759 --> 08:10.237
He is the giver of your wisdom.

08:10.438 --> 08:18.490
In the wisdom what you do is to find
solutions, solutions which are peaceful,

08:18.691 --> 08:23.629
which are satisfying, which are soothing.

08:23.830 --> 08:27.569
He is the one who takes you to task also.

08:27.770 --> 08:32.929
Like yesterday I was told there was
a whirlwind, and many people had to suffer

08:33.143 --> 08:40.102
little bit because of the wind that came
and blew off your tents.

08:40.975 --> 08:44.437
There’s no need to have tents in this
climate, what is the need?

08:44.638 --> 08:49.969
I don’t understand. But they cannot live
without a tent, you see.

08:50.170 --> 08:54.083
I can sleep outside very nicely,
on the street also.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.666
So there’s no need to sort of fuss about
all these things

08:57.867 --> 09:02.689
and bring the whole household here,
there’s no need.

09:02.967 --> 09:07.447
We should not be afraid of discomfort.

09:07.648 --> 09:13.200
If you want to have a very comfortable life
and you can’t suffer any discomfort,

09:13.401 --> 09:18.554
you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. In olden
days people used to go to Himalayas,

09:18.755 --> 09:23.057
stand on one leg, pray to God, and they
didn’t give realization,

09:23.258 --> 09:27.452
they couldn’t get realization; while you
all have got realization.

09:27.638 --> 09:35.403
So one should not try to make oneself very,
very sort of a lordly person.

09:35.604 --> 09:38.155
There is no need to care for comfort.

09:38.360 --> 09:44.222
I can live in comfort and I can live in any
way, at this age also.

09:44.423 --> 09:50.041
So what you have to do is to, not
to practice, I say, asceticism

09:50.242 --> 09:53.353
but to become an ascetic.

09:53.554 --> 09:58.511
Practicing means trouble, but if you just
become an ascetic from within,

09:58.712 --> 10:04.435
then you don’t bother about these little,
little things here and there.

10:04.636 --> 10:09.529
But our style is still molded by outside
world.

10:09.759 --> 10:16.656
We haven’t got our own world, then we are
going as the fashion is.

10:16.857 --> 10:21.667
And once you start going with the fashion,
the wisdom disappears.

10:21.868 --> 10:26.012
I never tell anybody that you don’t have
this fashion or that fashion or anything.

10:26.213 --> 10:30.177
It’s your wisdom which will teach you.
Wisdom will teach you

10:30.378 --> 10:35.501
how to regulate yourself, because you have
come here to ascend,

10:35.702 --> 10:44.880
to achieve a very special place
in the realm of spirituality.

10:46.365 --> 10:51.205
I must stress again on the power of wisdom.

10:51.406 --> 10:54.793
Before doing anything you should just
appeal to your wisdom

10:54.994 --> 10:59.024
and find out if it is wise to be like that.

10:59.225 --> 11:04.038
With this practice you will reduce
your temper, absolutely.

11:04.239 --> 11:11.757
You’ll reduce your lust, you’ll reduce
your guilt very much;

11:11.958 --> 11:15.606
because once you start understanding that
there’s no wisdom

11:15.807 --> 11:19.927
in feeling guilty, your guilt will
disappear.

11:20.128 --> 11:26.511
Also the worst thing is that we have
a great desire to have this, have that,

11:26.712 --> 11:32.690
and to indulge into all kinds of greed.

11:32.891 --> 11:38.467
This greed becomes zero as soon as you
understand

11:38.668 --> 11:41.307
wisely that there’s no need.

11:41.508 --> 11:46.348
Otherwise all the time you’ll be thinking
about yourself, about your health,

11:46.549 --> 11:52.319
about your children, about your house,
whatever is supposed to be yours.

11:52.520 --> 11:57.094
But the death proves that there’s nothing
belongs to you.

11:57.295 --> 12:01.677
You have come alone, and you have to go
alone.

12:01.878 --> 12:07.421
This is the wisdom which is to be imbibed.
You cannot practice it,

12:07.622 --> 12:12.627
you cannot force it, but it’s to be imbibed
through your spirituality.

12:12.828 --> 12:16.196
Then the greatest thing that happens is
the joy,

12:16.397 --> 12:21.896
joy of the dancing of Shri Ganesh.

12:22.097 --> 12:28.817
Like a child you see Him dancing; how
joyous He feels, and you also feel.

12:29.018 --> 12:34.771
In the same way, a little child being born
within you,

12:34.972 --> 12:38.820
and you start behaving like a small child.

12:39.021 --> 12:46.550
Normally it has no sense of lust, greed,
nothing. It knows how to share.

12:46.751 --> 12:51.893
So this is the position, we say, that you
become a gana –

12:52.094 --> 12:58.938
the army of Shri Ganesh, they are ganas
and they are very powerful.

12:59.139 --> 13:03.397
And they do all the work of the world,
they live in this world,

13:03.598 --> 13:09.254
but all their source of energy is from
the Divine.

13:09.631 --> 13:14.219
So Shri Ganesha is an Omkara.

13:14.420 --> 13:18.587
He is the first created deity
by the Goddess,

13:18.762 --> 13:25.972
because He is auspiciousness. So, first
auspiciousness is created for our good.

13:26.173 --> 13:32.506
We are auspicious because of Shri Ganesha.
Some people, if they are in the house

13:32.707 --> 13:37.579
they create problems. They are always
creating problems out of nothing.

13:37.780 --> 13:42.338
They are not auspicious people. Those
who are peacemakers,

13:42.539 --> 13:49.253
those who are loving are the ones who are
blessed by Shri Ganesha.

13:49.454 --> 13:56.377
What is the wisdom in fighting? You should
find out, what is the wisdom in fighting?

13:56.578 --> 14:00.605
Why are you fighting, for what things?
For small, small things,

14:00.806 --> 14:04.760
things that you can yourself correct?
Why should you fight?

14:04.961 --> 14:09.236
If you have a fighting nature, that means
Ganesha is against you,

14:09.437 --> 14:14.238
is your Ganesha is sleeping; that power is
not with you, there is no wisdom in it.

14:14.439 --> 14:18.438
In this world, all those great people who
have been respected

14:18.622 --> 14:23.246
since centuries have been very, very
wise people –

14:23.447 --> 14:27.979
not hot-tempered, not people who were
quarreling,

14:28.180 --> 14:33.438
not people who were having lust as the aim
of their life.

14:33.639 --> 14:37.112
Such people will be never remembered
by the progeny.

14:37.313 --> 14:42.299
But that’s not so important, as you as
Sahaja yogis are very important.

14:42.500 --> 14:48.958
You are here on this earth to emancipate
the whole of humanity.

14:49.159 --> 14:55.772
So, what should be the aim of your life
is to go deep into your spirituality.

14:55.973 --> 15:00.993
This aim of getting into spirituality,
I think you all know, you see,

15:01.194 --> 15:04.769
but you do not work out.

15:04.944 --> 15:10.009
I have told you last time that your
attention has to be inside,

15:10.210 --> 15:12.809
not outside, and you should not react.

15:13.010 --> 15:21.452
All these procedures help you to be wise,
to be sensible.

15:21.653 --> 15:29.079
But the sensible person who is just sensible
as far as his own comforts are concerned,

15:29.280 --> 15:34.034
money is concerned or his own health
is concerned –

15:34.235 --> 15:41.282
everything encompassing him – is
not a wise person. He is not wise.

15:41.483 --> 15:46.563
If you see a little child, who is properly
brought up of course,

15:46.764 --> 15:49.868
he will always bother about other people.

15:50.069 --> 15:57.058
He’ll find out what others need, what are
– what can make them happy.

15:57.259 --> 16:03.005
He’ll list all the simple methods, he will
try to please others,

16:03.206 --> 16:08.619
but not to gain any favor or to show off
that he is very generous,

16:08.797 --> 16:15.681
but in the real sense of the word, that
gives him joy. That is the collectivity.

16:15.882 --> 16:19.337
Today I am going to tell you something more
about this collective nature

16:19.538 --> 16:27.767
that comes to you through Shri Ganesha’s
efforts, or we can say His powers.

16:29.513 --> 16:33.649
Somebody told Me that Einstein has already
made a story like that,

16:33.850 --> 16:38.545
is a discovery that if you all become cool,

16:38.746 --> 16:46.995
that is under the Shri Ganesha’s blessings,
then we all become one.

16:48.281 --> 16:55.057
That’s his theory, but we also had
Phil Ward here who established

16:55.258 --> 16:59.352
that when you cool down the helium gas,

16:59.553 --> 17:07.764
all the molecules or you can call them
atoms,

17:07.978 --> 17:11.785
they start moving in a collective way.

17:11.986 --> 17:15.741
Otherwise they are hitting each other,
they are beating each other

17:15.942 --> 17:18.581
and they are running helter and skelter.

17:18.782 --> 17:23.406
In the same way, when we have
Shri Ganesha’s blessings within us

17:23.607 --> 17:26.612
in the real sense of the word,
with our wisdom,

17:26.813 --> 17:34.374
then what happens, we become very much
evolved Sahaja yogis.

17:34.575 --> 17:39.031
“Evolved Sahaja yogis” are, means they
have become one.

17:39.232 --> 17:44.891
“One” means what? “One” means they all
live for each other,

17:45.092 --> 17:51.654
they enjoy each other, they see the comfort
of each other.

17:51.855 --> 17:58.761
For example, the people who are very rich,
people who are very poor,

17:58.962 --> 18:01.550
people who are sick, people who are
healthy,

18:01.751 --> 18:05.599
all of them combine together as one.

18:05.800 --> 18:11.203
In Sanskrit it is called “ekakarita” –
they become one.

18:11.404 --> 18:16.694
And this oneness shows in your
celebrations, when you all come here

18:16.895 --> 18:19.545
you try to help each other all the time,
I’ve seen –

18:19.746 --> 18:22.610
nobody minds helping each other.

18:22.811 --> 18:28.530
I have seen people enjoying each other.
They do not want to hurt anyone;

18:28.731 --> 18:33.422
on the contrary, they want to be helpful
and sensible with each other.

18:33.623 --> 18:41.629
Most of your leaders I have chosen who are
very wise, who avoid problems,

18:41.830 --> 18:46.551
who do not get into panics, most of them,
I should say.

18:46.752 --> 18:52.526
And when you see, even you people try
to destroy Sahaja Yoga,

18:52.727 --> 18:55.240
they know you are doing it.

18:55.441 --> 19:00.906
So to find out this ekakarita, you have
to go deep down into yourself,

19:01.107 --> 19:04.281
by which you will feel that you are
all one.

19:04.482 --> 19:10.346
Whether you are here or you are in Japan
or in America, anywhere,

19:10.547 --> 19:15.210
you all think the same way, you all help
the same cause,

19:15.411 --> 19:18.835
and you try to be the same style.

19:19.036 --> 19:24.178
I have seen people when they come
for the pujas, so many of them,

19:24.379 --> 19:30.077
how they enjoy each other’s company,
how they try to help each other.

19:30.278 --> 19:38.692
Somebody who is, say, in Russia or say,
in Bulgaria, anywhere,

19:38.893 --> 19:45.794
he will write to Me about the problem
he has, something.

19:45.995 --> 19:50.658
So somebody from America, without I tell
him, without I inform him,

19:50.859 --> 19:55.621
without any information immediately writes
to Me, “Mother, such and such a person

19:55.822 --> 20:01.684
is there in Russia. Will You be able
to send that person to America?”.

20:02.678 --> 20:07.399
Most of the time it happens like this.
But I don’t tell them.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.512
I never ask them. Even if I ask, suddenly

20:11.713 --> 20:17.906
there will be a response from so many
people, from so many countries,

20:18.107 --> 20:22.976
“Mother, this is the problem? All right,
we’ll go and do it." For that I must say

20:23.177 --> 20:28.781
Austrians are very sensitive people
in this respect, in this ekakarita.

20:28.982 --> 20:33.614
They went all the way to Jerusalem,

20:34.317 --> 20:39.874
you know, to help the people, to get
them realized.

20:40.075 --> 20:45.023
I wanted to go to Jerusalem, but this
bombing business may not allow Me to go.

20:45.224 --> 20:51.001
But the Jerusalem people, I found them,
found them to be much more collective,

20:51.169 --> 20:56.350
because they came to Egypt.
I said, “Why have you come here?”

20:56.551 --> 21:02.055
“Make friends with the Muslims of Egypt."

21:02.799 --> 21:06.161
Just imagine! I was surprised.
How could they come here?

21:06.362 --> 21:11.130
“No, just to make friends. They are Muslims,
so we want to make friends with them.”

21:11.330 --> 21:15.356
So making friendship without any ulterior
motive,

21:15.557 --> 21:20.665
without any gain, is one of the signs
of your ekakarita.

21:20.866 --> 21:24.122
Not only that you are satisfied with other
Sahaja yogis,

21:24.323 --> 21:30.680
but you want to bring other Sahaja yogis in.
So many have done that.

21:30.881 --> 21:36.688
This is something so nourishing.

21:37.581 --> 21:43.514
Now, as you are been enlightened,

21:43.715 --> 21:49.838
you get another person who is enlightened.
It’s very great joy-giving.

21:50.039 --> 21:54.332
If you give realization to one person,
you feel very happy.

21:54.533 --> 22:00.338
I mean, so many write to Me, “Mother, now
we have got thirty persons, twenty persons”,

22:00.539 --> 22:04.527
and they are very happy about it, that
we have got so many Sahaja yogis.

22:04.728 --> 22:09.734
But doing that, one should not develop
the ego – then again you go against Ganesha,

22:09.935 --> 22:13.870
because Christ, you know, He doesn’t
like it.

22:14.071 --> 22:18.431
Egoistical people He doesn’t like, and
He is Shri Ganesh.

22:18.632 --> 22:24.390
So He doesn’t like such people who
out of their ego want to create

22:24.591 --> 22:28.825
an organization of their own, and try
to dominate others.

22:29.039 --> 22:32.538
This kind of people they don’t like.

22:32.745 --> 22:37.546
Both of them are the same, there is
complete ekakarita between them.

22:37.747 --> 22:42.966
In the same way we too develop that special
quality of ekakarita.

22:43.167 --> 22:48.129
We forget about so-called religions that
we have. See now how they are fighting.

22:48.330 --> 22:51.598
All the religions which are outside are
fighting among themselves.

22:51.799 --> 22:56.008
They are dishonest, they are doing all kinds
of wrong things – you know it very well.

22:56.209 --> 23:01.412
Every day it’s in the newspaper that you
hear about what wrong they are doing.

23:01.613 --> 23:04.546
They are little bit successful, but not
for a long time,

23:04.747 --> 23:07.765
because they’ll be exposed. This is
the time of exposure,

23:07.966 --> 23:15.276
that they will lose that great faith
on which they have been working out.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.848
All these will have to just disappear,

23:20.049 --> 23:25.097
these false ideas about superiority
of any religion.

23:25.298 --> 23:28.563
How can a religion be superior to another
one,

23:28.764 --> 23:34.105
which is created by the effort
of Shri Ganesha’s auspiciousness?

23:34.306 --> 23:38.050
It’s not auspicious at all that you fight
another religion

23:38.251 --> 23:46.742
or you fight another creed, or you say
that this is a lesser race,

23:46.943 --> 23:52.742
or we are a higher race. All these false
ideas, they drop out.

23:52.943 --> 23:57.972
This doesn’t remain anymore, because all
these ideas have created problems.

23:58.173 --> 24:04.193
Say in America, they first hated the blacks,
so now the blacks are hating the whites.

24:04.394 --> 24:07.715
It’s a big turmoil going on, you see.

24:07.929 --> 24:18.277
Then we have, also in India we had people
who were supposed to be untouchables.

24:18.478 --> 24:22.752
They were tortured, they were troubled,
and they did a lot of wrong things

24:22.953 --> 24:26.725
which they should have never done, which is
not written in the shastras.

24:26.926 --> 24:32.469
Because of that now they are acting against
the so-called “touchables”

24:32.670 --> 24:39.369
and putting them right in their own places.
So this brings in conflict.

24:39.570 --> 24:43.183
Shri Ganesha is the one, when He gives you
wisdom, you understand

24:43.384 --> 24:46.881
that nobody is superior to another person.

24:47.082 --> 24:53.929
You are all made by God, and is whatever is
made by God is auspicious and beautiful.

24:54.130 --> 25:00.126
Once you start understanding that,
this ekakarita spreads outside also.

25:00.327 --> 25:08.149
It spreads to other people. It’s not just
because of a certain social understanding

25:08.350 --> 25:14.328
and a social upliftment you try to be good
to others – no.

25:14.529 --> 25:18.153
It is from inside; inside you do it.

25:18.354 --> 25:22.474
This ekakarita first must work
in the family. It’s very important.

25:22.675 --> 25:27.071
The family which is disturbed all the time
cannot create children

25:27.272 --> 25:31.365
who are in the state of ekakarita.

25:31.566 --> 25:36.187
That’s why always tell them that don’t
fight.

25:36.388 --> 25:41.462
In the family they are fighting, they
cannot be Sahaja yogis.

25:41.663 --> 25:44.942
If there is such a fight it’s better
to get out of such a family.

25:45.143 --> 25:48.509
So we have sanctioned also a divorce.

25:48.710 --> 25:53.574
Any man who is flirting with other women
or doing wrong things,

25:53.775 --> 25:56.208
we have asked him to get out
of Sahaja Yoga.

25:56.409 --> 25:59.902
The reason is, one bad apple can spoil many
apples.

26:00.103 --> 26:04.506
So such a man or such a woman should be
kept out of Sahaja Yoga completely,

26:04.707 --> 26:08.320
so that there is a better family
relationship,

26:08.521 --> 26:11.383
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

26:11.584 --> 26:17.214
Your family relationships should be
absolutely perfect.

26:17.415 --> 26:22.232
But I can’t understand: you can’t enjoy
the company of your wife,

26:22.433 --> 26:25.107
then what are you going to enjoy
in this world?

26:25.308 --> 26:31.358
If you cannot enjoy the bliss of your family
life, you cannot enjoy anything else.

26:31.559 --> 26:36.545
This very close relationship of husband
and wife is thrown apart

26:36.746 --> 26:39.453
because of Ganesha problem only.

26:39.654 --> 26:44.257
If the Ganesha was all right there would
have been a perfect union,

26:44.458 --> 26:48.844
perfect understanding between husband
and wife. But that fails,

26:49.045 --> 26:54.868
that means there’s definitely something
wrong with the Shri Ganesha.

26:55.069 --> 26:59.977
Try to correct your own Shri Ganesh
than to see to others.

27:00.178 --> 27:05.117
You have to meditate, and meditate
on Shri Ganesh,

27:05.318 --> 27:08.529
you sit on the ground and meditate.

27:08.730 --> 27:13.570
Now when we run away from the Mother Earth
and we don’t touch her,

27:13.771 --> 27:19.217
we don’t respect her, in a way we don’t
respect Shri Ganesha.

27:19.418 --> 27:24.566
He was made out of Mother Earth,
and He controls the Mother Earth.

27:24.767 --> 27:33.369
He controls all the five elements. Not only
that, but He controls you.

27:33.570 --> 27:37.914
I liked the film yesterday where they
showed a Ganesha walking about

27:38.115 --> 27:42.410
with another person, who was telling,
“Don’t do this, and don’t do this.”

27:42.611 --> 27:46.462
It’s a very, very beautiful film, because
it suggests

27:46.663 --> 27:50.307
that Ganesha is always there to tell you
not to do it.

27:50.508 --> 27:54.886
But if you do it then you develop all kinds
of horrible diseases,

27:55.087 --> 28:01.474
all kinds of horrible faces, all kinds
of family problems;

28:01.675 --> 28:05.147
also you can develop national problems.

28:05.348 --> 28:13.429
So this is so important to understand,
that such a feeling of,

28:14.223 --> 28:22.428
I should say, very inauspicious character
are to be avoided.

28:22.629 --> 28:27.946
I can’t understand, how can people feel
so bad about small, small children,

28:28.124 --> 28:30.988
some two-year-old child, some
five-year-old child?

28:31.189 --> 28:36.034
If you see a child, even a photograph
of a child, you feel like loving that,

28:36.235 --> 28:40.716
you feel like kissing that child.
If the children cannot be respected,

28:40.917 --> 28:44.888
how can you understand the value
of Shri Ganesha?

28:45.089 --> 28:49.430
See how sweet they are, how sweetly
they behave,

28:49.631 --> 28:55.779
and they are – they understand! They
understand you, they understand Me.

28:55.980 --> 28:58.884
I know, even the small children, those who
are very small,

28:59.085 --> 29:02.089
newly-born children understand Me.

29:02.290 --> 29:08.685
So there’s innately within them is built in
a kind of a feeling

29:08.886 --> 29:12.697
of understanding the love.

29:12.898 --> 29:18.046
To understand the love also is very
difficult for egoistical people,

29:18.231 --> 29:20.824
because they love themselves, they don’t
love anybody else.

29:21.025 --> 29:24.964
Or if they love somebody it is out of lust,
maybe greed,

29:25.165 --> 29:29.714
maybe some sort of a association.

29:29.915 --> 29:33.102
But love for love’s sake is only possible

29:33.303 --> 29:39.869
if your Shri Ganesha is properly cleaned
out and kept there.

29:40.521 --> 29:47.815
We have come so far, and we have so many
Sahaja yogis all over the world.

29:48.016 --> 29:50.930
Of course, I have worked very hard,
I must say,

29:51.131 --> 29:56.259
but you also have supported Me very much.
I am thankful to you.

29:56.460 --> 30:01.409
It’s not possible in this Western world
specially, where there’s no consideration

30:01.610 --> 30:08.322
of Ganesha’s Principle, that you people
should come out so well

30:08.523 --> 30:13.949
and accept Sahaja Yoga as a life
for yourself.

30:14.150 --> 30:21.891
In Sahaja Yog the most important thing is
to worship Shri Ganesha within you,

30:22.565 --> 30:27.267
and the quality of Shri Ganesha within you.
It’s very soothing,

30:27.468 --> 30:36.561
it’s very peace-giving, it’s very secure,
secure – security-creating power.

30:36.762 --> 30:41.540
If your Ganesha is all right nobody can
touch you,

30:41.741 --> 30:47.543
nobody can destroy you, nobody can
upset you

30:47.744 --> 30:51.022
because He is the one who is the giver
of peace.

30:51.223 --> 30:55.868
The world peace is disturbed because
we have not worshipped Shri Ganesha.

30:56.069 --> 30:58.994
I’ve seen people in very big positions,

30:59.195 --> 31:04.239
in charge of military, in charge of that,
in charge – not in charge of themselves.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.698
Their Ganesha is absolutely ruined and finished.

31:07.899 --> 31:11.993
All such people are such leaders
of nations,

31:12.194 --> 31:16.115
and people try to follow them
in their own way.

31:16.316 --> 31:20.493
Though they may do something secretly,
doesn’t matter; people know about it.

31:20.694 --> 31:24.601
Because in auspiciousness if you are
losing,

31:24.802 --> 31:29.475
then the whole world comes to know,
somehow.

31:29.676 --> 31:34.155
It will all be exposed, because Satya Yuga
has come.

31:34.356 --> 31:40.046
In this new Yuga there’s light of the truth
within us,

31:40.247 --> 31:48.701
and this truth can expose all that is
nonsensical we have been doing.

31:48.902 --> 31:56.586
Now truth is the quality of Shri Ganesh
Himself.

31:56.825 --> 32:02.140
He is the one who is giving us truth.

32:02.348 --> 32:08.153
In our brain it comes to us through
Jesus Christ.

32:10.194 --> 32:16.442
Jesus Christ has worked so much, He’s done
so much;

32:16.643 --> 32:22.147
but look at the condition of the people
who are supposed to be following Him,

32:22.993 --> 32:28.681
look at the way they are behaving. Let us
at least show that if you follow

32:28.882 --> 32:35.195
Ganesha and Jesus Christ, you are
in the image of that personality

32:35.396 --> 32:41.626
which is something so very spiritual.
Spiritual life is the giver of joy.

32:41.827 --> 32:46.041
You cannot get joy out of anything else
but spirituality.

32:46.242 --> 32:49.263
You can get some satisfaction, you can get
some ego,

32:49.464 --> 32:53.624
you might feel that you are something
great, but the only way you can get

32:53.825 --> 33:02.058
the inner peace and joy is Shri Ganesha’s
manifestation in all the chakras.

33:02.259 --> 33:08.238
He manifests in all the chakras which,
when you are

33:08.991 --> 33:14.054
in a proper state on those chakras,
you get the joy,

33:14.255 --> 33:20.408
and that joy comes to you through
Shri Ganesh.

33:21.035 --> 33:25.044
These days people are writing horrible
books, horrible things.

33:25.245 --> 33:31.712
Also there are some who are trying to write
very sweet things

33:31.913 --> 33:36.278
about Shri Ganesha’s principle
of understanding,

33:36.479 --> 33:40.789
principle of His auspiciousness.

33:40.990 --> 33:43.653
Very sweetly I’ve seen some people have
written

33:43.854 --> 33:49.242
some very, very sweet stories about Him.

33:49.443 --> 33:53.997
It’s not only the love stories –
up to a point, all right,

33:54.198 --> 33:57.927
they created so many love stories,
love stories, love stories.

33:58.128 --> 34:01.319
Now something beyond that one has to know.

34:01.520 --> 34:06.501
And beyond that is this Ganesha Principle,

34:06.702 --> 34:13.503
which is of complete peace, of complete
joy,

34:14.065 --> 34:20.594
and of understanding of love, the value
of pure love;

34:20.795 --> 34:24.829
of giving, and also of taking it.

34:25.030 --> 34:31.988
Anyone who gives you the pure love
should be understood in the right way.

34:32.476 --> 34:37.890
I yesterday knew that Shri Ganesha has gone
off a little bit.

34:38.091 --> 34:43.388
I don’t know why He was like that,
but one has to understand

34:43.589 --> 34:46.949
that there must be some people within us
who do not follow

34:47.150 --> 34:51.921
the Principle of Shri Ganesh, and that’s
why these troubles are there.

34:52.122 --> 34:57.160
So with sincere heart and a sincere mind

34:57.361 --> 35:02.314
if you ask the blessings of Shri Ganesh,
He is always ready to give you.

35:02.515 --> 35:13.049
But if you don’t listen to Him and if you
destroy your chastity in any way,

35:13.250 --> 35:19.855
He will punish you. He’ll not spare you,
He doesn’t have the idea of sparing.

35:20.056 --> 35:27.779
At the level of Christ only, He thought
of forgiving, of forgiving you.

35:27.980 --> 35:34.155
But forgiving doesn’t mean that any, any
sin can be forgiven – no.

35:34.356 --> 35:37.822
It's like a kind of a controlling power.

35:38.023 --> 35:43.765
Christ has said that you’ll be forgiven,
but Shri Ganesha at a point,

35:43.966 --> 35:52.288
when He sees people are forgiving,
He tries to punish you.

35:53.486 --> 35:56.929
That’s the limiting point where He thinks
it’s not proper

35:57.130 --> 36:03.814
to forgive such and such person. So
for Christ, to forgive is all right,

36:04.544 --> 36:10.771
but for Ganesha, He has to expose
and punish the person.

36:10.958 --> 36:16.434
So in a way you have to know that Christ is
very great,

36:16.635 --> 36:20.830
because He gives us, He gives us
the forgiving power job,

36:21.031 --> 36:28.888
and Shri Ganesha is very powerful because
He limits our forgiving power.

36:29.089 --> 36:35.470
You may forgive anyone, you may say that,
“I would like to forgive,”

36:35.671 --> 36:41.285
but we don’t know if Shri Ganesh will allow
to that extent.

36:41.486 --> 36:45.892
And Christ accepts that, because they are
the same,

36:46.093 --> 36:48.619
they are like the two sides of one coin.

36:48.820 --> 36:55.040
So we cannot depend too much

36:55.241 --> 37:01.494
on the forgiveness power of Christ, because
there is Ganesha always sitting there

37:01.695 --> 37:08.858
and He has in His hand, you have seen,
a very powerful weapon.

37:09.059 --> 37:15.147
He is the one who is just peace, who is
coolness,

37:15.348 --> 37:18.572
who gives you coolness after realization.

37:18.754 --> 37:23.119
You get the cool breeze because
of Shri Ganesh,

37:23.674 --> 37:31.057
because it is Brahmachaitanya, no doubt,
but the one who emits it is Shri Ganesha.

37:31.258 --> 37:38.142
He cools you down. He brings you down
to a very cool, satisfied,

37:38.343 --> 37:43.943
and a person with complete calmness.

37:44.144 --> 37:46.931
With that calmness you become all one.

37:47.132 --> 37:51.043
This ekakarita is established, oneness is
established.

37:51.244 --> 38:01.757
Whatever country you may be believing in,
whatever country you may be proud of,

38:01.958 --> 38:06.913
you will see the bad things in that country
and you will try to improve that.

38:07.114 --> 38:09.439
You will not be identified with the bad.

38:09.640 --> 38:13.969
This is the greatest thing of the Satya
Yuga, that it exposes,

38:14.170 --> 38:18.797
and you do not support something
that is wrong,

38:18.998 --> 38:25.449
which is being done as a aggression
– you don’t accept.

38:25.650 --> 38:30.972
And once you don’t accept that, then
you start becoming one with the people

38:31.173 --> 38:35.712
who are one with you. And they all
believe in the same thing,

38:35.913 --> 38:40.916
their ideas are the same, their thinking
is the same, their joy is the same,

38:41.141 --> 38:43.709
and they enjoy each other very much.

38:43.910 --> 38:50.801
They become one, and this oneness has to be
established fully in Sahaja Yoga.

38:51.354 --> 38:54.529
Some people who are only interested
in making money,

38:54.730 --> 38:59.308
who are interested in getting a good crowd
or some sort of a thing

38:59.509 --> 39:05.681
of a very low level, cannot; those who are
in Sahaja Yoga to find

39:05.882 --> 39:10.813
wives for themselves or husbands for
themselves, aren’t going to.

39:11.014 --> 39:14.413
This spirituality grows with humility.

39:14.614 --> 39:21.675
And the humility of Ganesha is told by
His venture once, when His Mother asked Him

39:21.876 --> 39:27.959
that, “The one who will go round the Earth
three times, I’ll give Him a present."

39:28.160 --> 39:36.649
So Ganesha thought, “Who is greater
than My Mother? Not this Earth."

39:36.850 --> 39:40.061
He had a small little rat on which He used
to travel.

39:40.262 --> 39:46.486
This shows that He was so humble: on a rat
He could travel, no pressure on the rat.

39:46.687 --> 39:55.658
And while His brother Kartikeya had
a peacock which could fly,

39:55.843 --> 40:01.981
so He knew He cannot go round the world
and win over His brother.

40:02.182 --> 40:07.604
So He just went round His Mother three
times, and He got the present.

40:07.805 --> 40:14.022
This shows one thing, that speed is not
the way of success.

40:14.223 --> 40:17.292
You have to slow down your speed.

40:17.498 --> 40:21.827
Apart from that, you have to understand
what is the most important thing,

40:22.028 --> 40:27.172
as He understood the most important
thing is

40:29.172 --> 40:32.181
to love your Mother, to respect
your Mother,

40:32.382 --> 40:40.274
and know that She is the highest, She is
the greatest.

40:40.475 --> 40:47.099
And that is how He has been expressed
within ourselves.

40:47.300 --> 40:51.019
Once that happens, your spirituality grows.

40:51.220 --> 40:58.341
I hope you will work it out this way now,
Shri Ganesha, and start an ekakarita.

40:58.542 --> 41:01.705
I don’t like people writing letters against
their leaders,

41:01.906 --> 41:06.992
against this man, against that man.
That’s not good. There’s no need.

41:07.193 --> 41:16.037
If you just can be forgiving, and keeping
one with each other.

41:16.238 --> 41:21.633
Try to get more people, and more people.
You cannot separate anyone

41:21.834 --> 41:25.750
as saying that they are condemned,
they are no good. Try to get them.

41:25.951 --> 41:30.660
With your forgiveness, with your sense
of chastity, things will improve.

41:30.861 --> 41:33.953
So this exclusiveness also should be
given up,

41:34.154 --> 41:38.629
which perhaps comes from a kind of a sense
of insecurity, I think.

41:38.830 --> 41:42.737
It is Shri Ganesha! If they are wrong type
of people, He drives them out.

41:42.938 --> 41:46.729
So don’t get frightened of them, and don’t
get upset with them.

41:46.930 --> 41:55.261
Try to be one, one, and try to be more
attracting people to yourself,

41:55.462 --> 42:00.825
keeping them to you, trying to manage them
and look after them.

42:01.026 --> 42:06.408
I hope you will all meditate now after this
to develop your Ganesha qualities,

42:06.609 --> 42:13.981
and develop that power of chastity,
and also of peace and security.

42:14.182 --> 42:16.246
May God bless you.
