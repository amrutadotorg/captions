00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:11.182
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesh.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:22.194
I think I have told you a lot about Him and
His nature,

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:27.515
but still so many of us have not yet
realized

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:33.044
what are His powers, and what He wants.

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:46.202
First and foremost thing is that to respect
Shri Ganesha

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:52.343
is to understand the importance
of chastity.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:01:00.628
Chastity is not only for the women, it is
more for the men to observe.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.510
If you have self-respect, in the real sense
of the word,

00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.357
you will take to chastity without
any difficulties.

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:19.801
But if you have no self-respect, then you
run after something which is very low,

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:25.713
of a very degrading quality.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.567
So it’s very important that chastity must
be respected,

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:38.981
must be understood, and must be imbibed.

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:47.951
This habit of not observing the proper
protocol

00:01:48.152 --> 00:01:55.479
of the chastity develops from childhood,
and we have to be very careful,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.798
when we are in a Ganesha state we should
not take to such horrible things.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.058
I don’t know from where people get
the ideas.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:18.055
As you see today in the whole world there’s
a crisis of chastity.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.879
In the West specially, we have heard
of so many cases of child abuse.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.102
In a temple of God one should not even take
the name

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:35.658
of this dirty disease which has grabbed
the people.

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.237
But in India we have never heard of it,
we don’t know.

00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:44.891
Of course, some of the men are very, very
ruined people

00:02:45.092 --> 00:02:50.969
and they can’t help it, unless and until
they are put into jail.

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:58.039
But for a Sahaja yogi it is very important
to look after our chastities.

00:02:58.248 --> 00:03:01.411
As I told you yesterday, it is not
necessary

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:05.619
to find a girl for yourself or a boy
for yourself.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.960
It’s also against the rules of chastity.

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:17.380
I’m not saying that you should allow only
your parents to decide,

00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:23.424
but let the Sahaja Yoga decide, because
you are Sahajis.

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:33.870
You are born after the image of Ganesha,
who ultimately becomes Christ.

00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:40.019
So what should be your attitude towards
chastity is very important.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.867
The most important thing, that

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.319
if we get ruined on our chastity level
then Sahaja Yoga is very, very difficult,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.910
and it doesn’t give you that blessing
as you should have.

00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:07.847
You saw yesterday people from Romania
and also from Ukraine

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:10.945
were singing so beautifully.

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:18.613
One of the reasons is that basically they
are very, very humble people.

00:04:18.814 --> 00:04:24.848
They are humbled down, so much so that
they have given up nonsensical ideas

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:29.422
about sex life and all that.

00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:37.715
So the humility will teach you that you are
not having your self-respect.

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:44.257
In the Islam they have stressed a very big
importance on chastity, very much.

00:04:44.478 --> 00:04:49.518
And this was gone to such an extent that
Mohammed Sahib said that you can have

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:58.128
five wives or four wives, but you don’t
have women who are prostitutes.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:06.905
Once this chastity starts leaving us,
we don’t mind anything under the sun.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:15.273
We have seen results of that working out
in many people who are very highly placed.

00:05:15.458 --> 00:05:19.795
And these highly placed people think that
they are something great,

00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:25.853
and they can overcome the binding of Jesus
Christ and they can do what they like,

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:32.784
go on misbehaving with women who are
under them.

00:05:32.985 --> 00:05:38.034
They may do it secretly, they may do it
any way, but Ganesha watches that,

00:05:38.235 --> 00:05:42.483
and He punishes them for what they are
doing.

00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:46.516
It’s a terrible thing to go into these kind
of ventures,

00:05:46.717 --> 00:05:50.189
which are not the field of Sahaja yogis.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.030
Sahaja yogis have to first of all steady
their eyes,

00:05:54.231 --> 00:06:02.925
because it is concerned with the power
of Jesus Christ.

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:07.219
But in all the Christian nations I have
seen people have wandering eyes –

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.563
very surprising, when Christ is their
leader, they worship Christ,

00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:20.049
go to church, sing the praise of Christ,
and they have wandering eyes all over.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:27.790
These wandering eyes cannot be
representative of the chastity of Christ.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:43.395
Now the second point is that the power
of Ganesha can only be manifested

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:48.861
if you are wise, because He is the giver
of wisdom.

00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:53.671
Now people don’t understand what is wisdom
is – this is the big problem.

00:06:53.893 --> 00:06:57.315
Intelligence, so-called, is not wisdom.

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:01.491
It can make you a very cunning, very
aggressive,

00:07:01.692 --> 00:07:05.523
and sometimes very subtle person

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:09.964
who can go on deceiving people, telling
lies, doing all kinds of things,

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:16.368
and believing in themselves that they are
very, very successful.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:22.209
Success is never the criteria of a Sahaja
yogi.

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:32.323
Success in Sahaja Yoga means very subtle
surrendering of oneself to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:32.524 --> 00:07:40.107
That is seldom to be found unless and until
you meditate every day.

00:07:40.308 --> 00:07:43.447
It’s very important that you must meditate.

00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:47.642
Those who do not meditate will be lost
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:53.449
because wisdom can only grow through
your inner inspiration.

00:07:53.799 --> 00:07:57.695
You can have this inner inspiration

00:08:00.254 --> 00:08:04.558
only if the power of Shri Ganesha
manifests.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:10.237
He is the giver of your wisdom.

00:08:10.438 --> 00:08:18.490
In the wisdom what you do is to find
solutions, solutions which are peaceful,

00:08:18.691 --> 00:08:23.629
which are satisfying, which are soothing.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.569
He is the one who takes you to task also.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.929
Like yesterday I was told there was
a whirlwind, and many people had to suffer

00:08:33.143 --> 00:08:40.102
little bit because of the wind that came
and blew off your tents.

00:08:40.975 --> 00:08:44.437
There’s no need to have tents in this
climate, what is the need?

00:08:44.638 --> 00:08:49.969
I don’t understand. But they cannot live
without a tent, you see.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.083
I can sleep outside very nicely,
on the street also.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:57.666
So there’s no need to sort of fuss about
all these things

00:08:57.867 --> 00:09:02.689
and bring the whole household here,
there’s no need.

00:09:02.967 --> 00:09:07.447
We should not be afraid of discomfort.

00:09:07.648 --> 00:09:13.200
If you want to have a very comfortable life
and you can’t suffer any discomfort,

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:18.554
you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. In olden
days people used to go to Himalayas,

00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:23.057
stand on one leg, pray to God, and they
didn’t give realization,

00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:27.452
they couldn’t get realization; while you
all have got realization.

00:09:27.638 --> 00:09:35.403
So one should not try to make oneself very,
very sort of a lordly person.

00:09:35.604 --> 00:09:38.155
There is no need to care for comfort.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.222
I can live in comfort and I can live in any
way, at this age also.

00:09:44.423 --> 00:09:50.041
So what you have to do is to, not
to practice, I say, asceticism

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:53.353
but to become an ascetic.

00:09:53.554 --> 00:09:58.511
Practicing means trouble, but if you just
become an ascetic from within,

00:09:58.712 --> 00:10:04.435
then you don’t bother about these little,
little things here and there.

00:10:04.636 --> 00:10:09.529
But our style is still molded by outside
world.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:16.656
We haven’t got our own world, then we are
going as the fashion is.

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:21.667
And once you start going with the fashion,
the wisdom disappears.

00:10:21.868 --> 00:10:26.012
I never tell anybody that you don’t have
this fashion or that fashion or anything.

00:10:26.213 --> 00:10:30.177
It’s your wisdom which will teach you.
Wisdom will teach you

00:10:30.378 --> 00:10:35.501
how to regulate yourself, because you have
come here to ascend,

00:10:35.702 --> 00:10:44.880
to achieve a very special place
in the realm of spirituality.

00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:51.205
I must stress again on the power of wisdom.

00:10:51.406 --> 00:10:54.793
Before doing anything you should just
appeal to your wisdom

00:10:54.994 --> 00:10:59.024
and find out if it is wise to be like that.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:04.038
With this practice you will reduce
your temper, absolutely.

00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:11.757
You’ll reduce your lust, you’ll reduce
your guilt very much;

00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:15.606
because once you start understanding that
there’s no wisdom

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:19.927
in feeling guilty, your guilt will
disappear.

00:11:20.128 --> 00:11:26.511
Also the worst thing is that we have
a great desire to have this, have that,

00:11:26.712 --> 00:11:32.690
and to indulge into all kinds of greed.

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:38.467
This greed becomes zero as soon as you
understand

00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:41.307
wisely that there’s no need.

00:11:41.508 --> 00:11:46.348
Otherwise all the time you’ll be thinking
about yourself, about your health,

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:52.319
about your children, about your house,
whatever is supposed to be yours.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.094
But the death proves that there’s nothing
belongs to you.

00:11:57.295 --> 00:12:01.677
You have come alone, and you have to go
alone.

00:12:01.878 --> 00:12:07.421
This is the wisdom which is to be imbibed.
You cannot practice it,

00:12:07.622 --> 00:12:12.627
you cannot force it, but it’s to be imbibed
through your spirituality.

00:12:12.828 --> 00:12:16.196
Then the greatest thing that happens is
the joy,

00:12:16.397 --> 00:12:21.896
joy of the dancing of Shri Ganesh.

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:28.817
Like a child you see Him dancing; how
joyous He feels, and you also feel.

00:12:29.018 --> 00:12:34.771
In the same way, a little child being born
within you,

00:12:34.972 --> 00:12:38.820
and you start behaving like a small child.

00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:46.550
Normally it has no sense of lust, greed,
nothing. It knows how to share.

00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:51.893
So this is the position, we say, that you
become a gana –

00:12:52.094 --> 00:12:58.938
the army of Shri Ganesh, they are ganas
and they are very powerful.

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:03.397
And they do all the work of the world,
they live in this world,

00:13:03.598 --> 00:13:09.254
but all their source of energy is from
the Divine.

00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:14.219
So Shri Ganesha is an Omkara.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.587
He is the first created deity
by the Goddess,

00:13:18.762 --> 00:13:25.972
because He is auspiciousness. So, first
auspiciousness is created for our good.

00:13:26.173 --> 00:13:32.506
We are auspicious because of Shri Ganesha.
Some people, if they are in the house

00:13:32.707 --> 00:13:37.579
they create problems. They are always
creating problems out of nothing.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.338
They are not auspicious people. Those
who are peacemakers,

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:49.253
those who are loving are the ones who are
blessed by Shri Ganesha.

00:13:49.454 --> 00:13:56.377
What is the wisdom in fighting? You should
find out, what is the wisdom in fighting?

00:13:56.578 --> 00:14:00.605
Why are you fighting, for what things?
For small, small things,

00:14:00.806 --> 00:14:04.760
things that you can yourself correct?
Why should you fight?

00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:09.236
If you have a fighting nature, that means
Ganesha is against you,

00:14:09.437 --> 00:14:14.238
is your Ganesha is sleeping; that power is
not with you, there is no wisdom in it.

00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:18.438
In this world, all those great people who
have been respected

00:14:18.622 --> 00:14:23.246
since centuries have been very, very
wise people –

00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:27.979
not hot-tempered, not people who were
quarreling,

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:33.438
not people who were having lust as the aim
of their life.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:37.112
Such people will be never remembered
by the progeny.

00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:42.299
But that’s not so important, as you as
Sahaja yogis are very important.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:48.958
You are here on this earth to emancipate
the whole of humanity.

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:55.772
So, what should be the aim of your life
is to go deep into your spirituality.

00:14:55.973 --> 00:15:00.993
This aim of getting into spirituality,
I think you all know, you see,

00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:04.769
but you do not work out.

00:15:04.944 --> 00:15:10.009
I have told you last time that your
attention has to be inside,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.809
not outside, and you should not react.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:21.452
All these procedures help you to be wise,
to be sensible.

00:15:21.653 --> 00:15:29.079
But the sensible person who is just sensible
as far as his own comforts are concerned,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.034
money is concerned or his own health
is concerned –

00:15:34.235 --> 00:15:41.282
everything encompassing him – is
not a wise person. He is not wise.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:46.563
If you see a little child, who is properly
brought up of course,

00:15:46.764 --> 00:15:49.868
he will always bother about other people.

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:57.058
He’ll find out what others need, what are
– what can make them happy.

00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:03.005
He’ll list all the simple methods, he will
try to please others,

00:16:03.206 --> 00:16:08.619
but not to gain any favor or to show off
that he is very generous,

00:16:08.797 --> 00:16:15.681
but in the real sense of the word, that
gives him joy. That is the collectivity.

00:16:15.882 --> 00:16:19.337
Today I am going to tell you something more
about this collective nature

00:16:19.538 --> 00:16:27.767
that comes to you through Shri Ganesha’s
efforts, or we can say His powers.

00:16:29.513 --> 00:16:33.649
Somebody told Me that Einstein has already
made a story like that,

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.545
is a discovery that if you all become cool,

00:16:38.746 --> 00:16:46.995
that is under the Shri Ganesha’s blessings,
then we all become one.

00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:55.057
That’s his theory, but we also had
Phil Ward here who established

00:16:55.258 --> 00:16:59.352
that when you cool down the helium gas,

00:16:59.553 --> 00:17:07.764
all the molecules or you can call them
atoms,

00:17:07.978 --> 00:17:11.785
they start moving in a collective way.

00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:15.741
Otherwise they are hitting each other,
they are beating each other

00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:18.581
and they are running helter and skelter.

00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:23.406
In the same way, when we have
Shri Ganesha’s blessings within us

00:17:23.607 --> 00:17:26.612
in the real sense of the word,
with our wisdom,

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:34.374
then what happens, we become very much
evolved Sahaja yogis.

00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:39.031
“Evolved Sahaja yogis” are, means they
have become one.

00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:44.891
“One” means what? “One” means they all
live for each other,

00:17:45.092 --> 00:17:51.654
they enjoy each other, they see the comfort
of each other.

00:17:51.855 --> 00:17:58.761
For example, the people who are very rich,
people who are very poor,

00:17:58.962 --> 00:18:01.550
people who are sick, people who are
healthy,

00:18:01.751 --> 00:18:05.599
all of them combine together as one.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.203
In Sanskrit it is called “ekakarita” –
they become one.

00:18:11.404 --> 00:18:16.694
And this oneness shows in your
celebrations, when you all come here

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:19.545
you try to help each other all the time,
I’ve seen –

00:18:19.746 --> 00:18:22.610
nobody minds helping each other.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:28.530
I have seen people enjoying each other.
They do not want to hurt anyone;

00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:33.422
on the contrary, they want to be helpful
and sensible with each other.

00:18:33.623 --> 00:18:41.629
Most of your leaders I have chosen who are
very wise, who avoid problems,

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.551
who do not get into panics, most of them,
I should say.

00:18:46.752 --> 00:18:52.526
And when you see, even you people try
to destroy Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:52.727 --> 00:18:55.240
they know you are doing it.

00:18:55.441 --> 00:19:00.906
So to find out this ekakarita, you have
to go deep down into yourself,

00:19:01.107 --> 00:19:04.281
by which you will feel that you are
all one.

00:19:04.482 --> 00:19:10.346
Whether you are here or you are in Japan
or in America, anywhere,

00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:15.210
you all think the same way, you all help
the same cause,

00:19:15.411 --> 00:19:18.835
and you try to be the same style.

00:19:19.036 --> 00:19:24.178
I have seen people when they come
for the pujas, so many of them,

00:19:24.379 --> 00:19:30.077
how they enjoy each other’s company,
how they try to help each other.

00:19:30.278 --> 00:19:38.692
Somebody who is, say, in Russia or say,
in Bulgaria, anywhere,

00:19:38.893 --> 00:19:45.794
he will write to Me about the problem
he has, something.

00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:50.658
So somebody from America, without I tell
him, without I inform him,

00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:55.621
without any information immediately writes
to Me, “Mother, such and such a person

00:19:55.822 --> 00:20:01.684
is there in Russia. Will You be able
to send that person to America?”.

00:20:02.678 --> 00:20:07.399
Most of the time it happens like this.
But I don’t tell them.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.512
I never ask them. Even if I ask, suddenly

00:20:11.713 --> 00:20:17.906
there will be a response from so many
people, from so many countries,

00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:22.976
“Mother, this is the problem? All right,
we’ll go and do it." For that I must say

00:20:23.177 --> 00:20:28.781
Austrians are very sensitive people
in this respect, in this ekakarita.

00:20:28.982 --> 00:20:33.614
They went all the way to Jerusalem,

00:20:34.317 --> 00:20:39.874
you know, to help the people, to get
them realized.

00:20:40.075 --> 00:20:45.023
I wanted to go to Jerusalem, but this
bombing business may not allow Me to go.

00:20:45.224 --> 00:20:51.001
But the Jerusalem people, I found them,
found them to be much more collective,

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:56.350
because they came to Egypt.
I said, “Why have you come here?”

00:20:56.551 --> 00:21:02.055
“Make friends with the Muslims of Egypt."

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:06.161
Just imagine! I was surprised.
How could they come here?

00:21:06.362 --> 00:21:11.130
“No, just to make friends. They are Muslims,
so we want to make friends with them.”

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:15.356
So making friendship without any ulterior
motive,

00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:20.665
without any gain, is one of the signs
of your ekakarita.

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:24.122
Not only that you are satisfied with other
Sahaja yogis,

00:21:24.323 --> 00:21:30.680
but you want to bring other Sahaja yogis in.
So many have done that.

00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:36.688
This is something so nourishing.

00:21:37.581 --> 00:21:43.514
Now, as you are been enlightened,

00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:49.838
you get another person who is enlightened.
It’s very great joy-giving.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:54.332
If you give realization to one person,
you feel very happy.

00:21:54.533 --> 00:22:00.338
I mean, so many write to Me, “Mother, now
we have got thirty persons, twenty persons”,

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:04.527
and they are very happy about it, that
we have got so many Sahaja yogis.

00:22:04.728 --> 00:22:09.734
But doing that, one should not develop
the ego – then again you go against Ganesha,

00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:13.870
because Christ, you know, He doesn’t
like it.

00:22:14.071 --> 00:22:18.431
Egoistical people He doesn’t like, and
He is Shri Ganesh.

00:22:18.632 --> 00:22:24.390
So He doesn’t like such people who
out of their ego want to create

00:22:24.591 --> 00:22:28.825
an organization of their own, and try
to dominate others.

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:32.538
This kind of people they don’t like.

00:22:32.745 --> 00:22:37.546
Both of them are the same, there is
complete ekakarita between them.

00:22:37.747 --> 00:22:42.966
In the same way we too develop that special
quality of ekakarita.

00:22:43.167 --> 00:22:48.129
We forget about so-called religions that
we have. See now how they are fighting.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.598
All the religions which are outside are
fighting among themselves.

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:56.008
They are dishonest, they are doing all kinds
of wrong things – you know it very well.

00:22:56.209 --> 00:23:01.412
Every day it’s in the newspaper that you
hear about what wrong they are doing.

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:04.546
They are little bit successful, but not
for a long time,

00:23:04.747 --> 00:23:07.765
because they’ll be exposed. This is
the time of exposure,

00:23:07.966 --> 00:23:15.276
that they will lose that great faith
on which they have been working out.

00:23:15.477 --> 00:23:19.848
All these will have to just disappear,

00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:25.097
these false ideas about superiority
of any religion.

00:23:25.298 --> 00:23:28.563
How can a religion be superior to another
one,

00:23:28.764 --> 00:23:34.105
which is created by the effort
of Shri Ganesha’s auspiciousness?

00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:38.050
It’s not auspicious at all that you fight
another religion

00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:46.742
or you fight another creed, or you say
that this is a lesser race,

00:23:46.943 --> 00:23:52.742
or we are a higher race. All these false
ideas, they drop out.

00:23:52.943 --> 00:23:57.972
This doesn’t remain anymore, because all
these ideas have created problems.

00:23:58.173 --> 00:24:04.193
Say in America, they first hated the blacks,
so now the blacks are hating the whites.

00:24:04.394 --> 00:24:07.715
It’s a big turmoil going on, you see.

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:18.277
Then we have, also in India we had people
who were supposed to be untouchables.

00:24:18.478 --> 00:24:22.752
They were tortured, they were troubled,
and they did a lot of wrong things

00:24:22.953 --> 00:24:26.725
which they should have never done, which is
not written in the shastras.

00:24:26.926 --> 00:24:32.469
Because of that now they are acting against
the so-called “touchables”

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:39.369
and putting them right in their own places.
So this brings in conflict.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.183
Shri Ganesha is the one, when He gives you
wisdom, you understand

00:24:43.384 --> 00:24:46.881
that nobody is superior to another person.

00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:53.929
You are all made by God, and is whatever is
made by God is auspicious and beautiful.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:25:00.126
Once you start understanding that,
this ekakarita spreads outside also.

00:25:00.327 --> 00:25:08.149
It spreads to other people. It’s not just
because of a certain social understanding

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:14.328
and a social upliftment you try to be good
to others – no.

00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:18.153
It is from inside; inside you do it.

00:25:18.354 --> 00:25:22.474
This ekakarita first must work
in the family. It’s very important.

00:25:22.675 --> 00:25:27.071
The family which is disturbed all the time
cannot create children

00:25:27.272 --> 00:25:31.365
who are in the state of ekakarita.

00:25:31.566 --> 00:25:36.187
That’s why always tell them that don’t
fight.

00:25:36.388 --> 00:25:41.462
In the family they are fighting, they
cannot be Sahaja yogis.

00:25:41.663 --> 00:25:44.942
If there is such a fight it’s better
to get out of such a family.

00:25:45.143 --> 00:25:48.509
So we have sanctioned also a divorce.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.574
Any man who is flirting with other women
or doing wrong things,

00:25:53.775 --> 00:25:56.208
we have asked him to get out
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:59.902
The reason is, one bad apple can spoil many
apples.

00:26:00.103 --> 00:26:04.506
So such a man or such a woman should be
kept out of Sahaja Yoga completely,

00:26:04.707 --> 00:26:08.320
so that there is a better family
relationship,

00:26:08.521 --> 00:26:11.383
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:11.584 --> 00:26:17.214
Your family relationships should be
absolutely perfect.

00:26:17.415 --> 00:26:22.232
But I can’t understand: you can’t enjoy
the company of your wife,

00:26:22.433 --> 00:26:25.107
then what are you going to enjoy
in this world?

00:26:25.308 --> 00:26:31.358
If you cannot enjoy the bliss of your family
life, you cannot enjoy anything else.

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:36.545
This very close relationship of husband
and wife is thrown apart

00:26:36.746 --> 00:26:39.453
because of Ganesha problem only.

00:26:39.654 --> 00:26:44.257
If the Ganesha was all right there would
have been a perfect union,

00:26:44.458 --> 00:26:48.844
perfect understanding between husband
and wife. But that fails,

00:26:49.045 --> 00:26:54.868
that means there’s definitely something
wrong with the Shri Ganesha.

00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:59.977
Try to correct your own Shri Ganesh
than to see to others.

00:27:00.178 --> 00:27:05.117
You have to meditate, and meditate
on Shri Ganesh,

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:08.529
you sit on the ground and meditate.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.570
Now when we run away from the Mother Earth
and we don’t touch her,

00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:19.217
we don’t respect her, in a way we don’t
respect Shri Ganesha.

00:27:19.418 --> 00:27:24.566
He was made out of Mother Earth,
and He controls the Mother Earth.

00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:33.369
He controls all the five elements. Not only
that, but He controls you.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:37.914
I liked the film yesterday where they
showed a Ganesha walking about

00:27:38.115 --> 00:27:42.410
with another person, who was telling,
“Don’t do this, and don’t do this.”

00:27:42.611 --> 00:27:46.462
It’s a very, very beautiful film, because
it suggests

00:27:46.663 --> 00:27:50.307
that Ganesha is always there to tell you
not to do it.

00:27:50.508 --> 00:27:54.886
But if you do it then you develop all kinds
of horrible diseases,

00:27:55.087 --> 00:28:01.474
all kinds of horrible faces, all kinds
of family problems;

00:28:01.675 --> 00:28:05.147
also you can develop national problems.

00:28:05.348 --> 00:28:13.429
So this is so important to understand,
that such a feeling of,

00:28:14.223 --> 00:28:22.428
I should say, very inauspicious character
are to be avoided.

00:28:22.629 --> 00:28:27.946
I can’t understand, how can people feel
so bad about small, small children,

00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:30.988
some two-year-old child, some
five-year-old child?

00:28:31.189 --> 00:28:36.034
If you see a child, even a photograph
of a child, you feel like loving that,

00:28:36.235 --> 00:28:40.716
you feel like kissing that child.
If the children cannot be respected,

00:28:40.917 --> 00:28:44.888
how can you understand the value
of Shri Ganesha?

00:28:45.089 --> 00:28:49.430
See how sweet they are, how sweetly
they behave,

00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:55.779
and they are – they understand! They
understand you, they understand Me.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.884
I know, even the small children, those who
are very small,

00:28:59.085 --> 00:29:02.089
newly-born children understand Me.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:08.685
So there’s innately within them is built in
a kind of a feeling

00:29:08.886 --> 00:29:12.697
of understanding the love.

00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:18.046
To understand the love also is very
difficult for egoistical people,

00:29:18.231 --> 00:29:20.824
because they love themselves, they don’t
love anybody else.

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:24.964
Or if they love somebody it is out of lust,
maybe greed,

00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:29.714
maybe some sort of a association.

00:29:29.915 --> 00:29:33.102
But love for love’s sake is only possible

00:29:33.303 --> 00:29:39.869
if your Shri Ganesha is properly cleaned
out and kept there.

00:29:40.521 --> 00:29:47.815
We have come so far, and we have so many
Sahaja yogis all over the world.

00:29:48.016 --> 00:29:50.930
Of course, I have worked very hard,
I must say,

00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:56.259
but you also have supported Me very much.
I am thankful to you.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.409
It’s not possible in this Western world
specially, where there’s no consideration

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:08.322
of Ganesha’s Principle, that you people
should come out so well

00:30:08.523 --> 00:30:13.949
and accept Sahaja Yoga as a life
for yourself.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:21.891
In Sahaja Yog the most important thing is
to worship Shri Ganesha within you,

00:30:22.565 --> 00:30:27.267
and the quality of Shri Ganesha within you.
It’s very soothing,

00:30:27.468 --> 00:30:36.561
it’s very peace-giving, it’s very secure,
secure – security-creating power.

00:30:36.762 --> 00:30:41.540
If your Ganesha is all right nobody can
touch you,

00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:47.543
nobody can destroy you, nobody can
upset you

00:30:47.744 --> 00:30:51.022
because He is the one who is the giver
of peace.

00:30:51.223 --> 00:30:55.868
The world peace is disturbed because
we have not worshipped Shri Ganesha.

00:30:56.069 --> 00:30:58.994
I’ve seen people in very big positions,

00:30:59.195 --> 00:31:04.239
in charge of military, in charge of that,
in charge – not in charge of themselves.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.698
Their Ganesha is absolutely ruined and finished.

00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:11.993
All such people are such leaders
of nations,

00:31:12.194 --> 00:31:16.115
and people try to follow them
in their own way.

00:31:16.316 --> 00:31:20.493
Though they may do something secretly,
doesn’t matter; people know about it.

00:31:20.694 --> 00:31:24.601
Because in auspiciousness if you are
losing,

00:31:24.802 --> 00:31:29.475
then the whole world comes to know,
somehow.

00:31:29.676 --> 00:31:34.155
It will all be exposed, because Satya Yuga
has come.

00:31:34.356 --> 00:31:40.046
In this new Yuga there’s light of the truth
within us,

00:31:40.247 --> 00:31:48.701
and this truth can expose all that is
nonsensical we have been doing.

00:31:48.902 --> 00:31:56.586
Now truth is the quality of Shri Ganesh
Himself.

00:31:56.825 --> 00:32:02.140
He is the one who is giving us truth.

00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:08.153
In our brain it comes to us through
Jesus Christ.

00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:16.442
Jesus Christ has worked so much, He’s done
so much;

00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:22.147
but look at the condition of the people
who are supposed to be following Him,

00:32:22.993 --> 00:32:28.681
look at the way they are behaving. Let us
at least show that if you follow

00:32:28.882 --> 00:32:35.195
Ganesha and Jesus Christ, you are
in the image of that personality

00:32:35.396 --> 00:32:41.626
which is something so very spiritual.
Spiritual life is the giver of joy.

00:32:41.827 --> 00:32:46.041
You cannot get joy out of anything else
but spirituality.

00:32:46.242 --> 00:32:49.263
You can get some satisfaction, you can get
some ego,

00:32:49.464 --> 00:32:53.624
you might feel that you are something
great, but the only way you can get

00:32:53.825 --> 00:33:02.058
the inner peace and joy is Shri Ganesha’s
manifestation in all the chakras.

00:33:02.259 --> 00:33:08.238
He manifests in all the chakras which,
when you are

00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:14.054
in a proper state on those chakras,
you get the joy,

00:33:14.255 --> 00:33:20.408
and that joy comes to you through
Shri Ganesh.

00:33:21.035 --> 00:33:25.044
These days people are writing horrible
books, horrible things.

00:33:25.245 --> 00:33:31.712
Also there are some who are trying to write
very sweet things

00:33:31.913 --> 00:33:36.278
about Shri Ganesha’s principle
of understanding,

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:40.789
principle of His auspiciousness.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.653
Very sweetly I’ve seen some people have
written

00:33:43.854 --> 00:33:49.242
some very, very sweet stories about Him.

00:33:49.443 --> 00:33:53.997
It’s not only the love stories –
up to a point, all right,

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:57.927
they created so many love stories,
love stories, love stories.

00:33:58.128 --> 00:34:01.319
Now something beyond that one has to know.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.501
And beyond that is this Ganesha Principle,

00:34:06.702 --> 00:34:13.503
which is of complete peace, of complete
joy,

00:34:14.065 --> 00:34:20.594
and of understanding of love, the value
of pure love;

00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:24.829
of giving, and also of taking it.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:31.988
Anyone who gives you the pure love
should be understood in the right way.

00:34:32.476 --> 00:34:37.890
I yesterday knew that Shri Ganesha has gone
off a little bit.

00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:43.388
I don’t know why He was like that,
but one has to understand

00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:46.949
that there must be some people within us
who do not follow

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:51.921
the Principle of Shri Ganesh, and that’s
why these troubles are there.

00:34:52.122 --> 00:34:57.160
So with sincere heart and a sincere mind

00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:02.314
if you ask the blessings of Shri Ganesh,
He is always ready to give you.

00:35:02.515 --> 00:35:13.049
But if you don’t listen to Him and if you
destroy your chastity in any way,

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:19.855
He will punish you. He’ll not spare you,
He doesn’t have the idea of sparing.

00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:27.779
At the level of Christ only, He thought
of forgiving, of forgiving you.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:34.155
But forgiving doesn’t mean that any, any
sin can be forgiven – no.

00:35:34.356 --> 00:35:37.822
It's like a kind of a controlling power.

00:35:38.023 --> 00:35:43.765
Christ has said that you’ll be forgiven,
but Shri Ganesha at a point,

00:35:43.966 --> 00:35:52.288
when He sees people are forgiving,
He tries to punish you.

00:35:53.486 --> 00:35:56.929
That’s the limiting point where He thinks
it’s not proper

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:03.814
to forgive such and such person. So
for Christ, to forgive is all right,

00:36:04.544 --> 00:36:10.771
but for Ganesha, He has to expose
and punish the person.

00:36:10.958 --> 00:36:16.434
So in a way you have to know that Christ is
very great,

00:36:16.635 --> 00:36:20.830
because He gives us, He gives us
the forgiving power job,

00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:28.888
and Shri Ganesha is very powerful because
He limits our forgiving power.

00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:35.470
You may forgive anyone, you may say that,
“I would like to forgive,”

00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:41.285
but we don’t know if Shri Ganesh will allow
to that extent.

00:36:41.486 --> 00:36:45.892
And Christ accepts that, because they are
the same,

00:36:46.093 --> 00:36:48.619
they are like the two sides of one coin.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:55.040
So we cannot depend too much

00:36:55.241 --> 00:37:01.494
on the forgiveness power of Christ, because
there is Ganesha always sitting there

00:37:01.695 --> 00:37:08.858
and He has in His hand, you have seen,
a very powerful weapon.

00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:15.147
He is the one who is just peace, who is
coolness,

00:37:15.348 --> 00:37:18.572
who gives you coolness after realization.

00:37:18.754 --> 00:37:23.119
You get the cool breeze because
of Shri Ganesh,

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:31.057
because it is Brahmachaitanya, no doubt,
but the one who emits it is Shri Ganesha.

00:37:31.258 --> 00:37:38.142
He cools you down. He brings you down
to a very cool, satisfied,

00:37:38.343 --> 00:37:43.943
and a person with complete calmness.

00:37:44.144 --> 00:37:46.931
With that calmness you become all one.

00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:51.043
This ekakarita is established, oneness is
established.

00:37:51.244 --> 00:38:01.757
Whatever country you may be believing in,
whatever country you may be proud of,

00:38:01.958 --> 00:38:06.913
you will see the bad things in that country
and you will try to improve that.

00:38:07.114 --> 00:38:09.439
You will not be identified with the bad.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.969
This is the greatest thing of the Satya
Yuga, that it exposes,

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.797
and you do not support something
that is wrong,

00:38:18.998 --> 00:38:25.449
which is being done as a aggression
– you don’t accept.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:30.972
And once you don’t accept that, then
you start becoming one with the people

00:38:31.173 --> 00:38:35.712
who are one with you. And they all
believe in the same thing,

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:40.916
their ideas are the same, their thinking
is the same, their joy is the same,

00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:43.709
and they enjoy each other very much.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:50.801
They become one, and this oneness has to be
established fully in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:51.354 --> 00:38:54.529
Some people who are only interested
in making money,

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:59.308
who are interested in getting a good crowd
or some sort of a thing

00:38:59.509 --> 00:39:05.681
of a very low level, cannot; those who are
in Sahaja Yoga to find

00:39:05.882 --> 00:39:10.813
wives for themselves or husbands for
themselves, aren’t going to.

00:39:11.014 --> 00:39:14.413
This spirituality grows with humility.

00:39:14.614 --> 00:39:21.675
And the humility of Ganesha is told by
His venture once, when His Mother asked Him

00:39:21.876 --> 00:39:27.959
that, “The one who will go round the Earth
three times, I’ll give Him a present."

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:36.649
So Ganesha thought, “Who is greater
than My Mother? Not this Earth."

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.061
He had a small little rat on which He used
to travel.

00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:46.486
This shows that He was so humble: on a rat
He could travel, no pressure on the rat.

00:39:46.687 --> 00:39:55.658
And while His brother Kartikeya had
a peacock which could fly,

00:39:55.843 --> 00:40:01.981
so He knew He cannot go round the world
and win over His brother.

00:40:02.182 --> 00:40:07.604
So He just went round His Mother three
times, and He got the present.

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:14.022
This shows one thing, that speed is not
the way of success.

00:40:14.223 --> 00:40:17.292
You have to slow down your speed.

00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:21.827
Apart from that, you have to understand
what is the most important thing,

00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:27.172
as He understood the most important
thing is

00:40:29.172 --> 00:40:32.181
to love your Mother, to respect
your Mother,

00:40:32.382 --> 00:40:40.274
and know that She is the highest, She is
the greatest.

00:40:40.475 --> 00:40:47.099
And that is how He has been expressed
within ourselves.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.019
Once that happens, your spirituality grows.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:58.341
I hope you will work it out this way now,
Shri Ganesha, and start an ekakarita.

00:40:58.542 --> 00:41:01.705
I don’t like people writing letters against
their leaders,

00:41:01.906 --> 00:41:06.992
against this man, against that man.
That’s not good. There’s no need.

00:41:07.193 --> 00:41:16.037
If you just can be forgiving, and keeping
one with each other.

00:41:16.238 --> 00:41:21.633
Try to get more people, and more people.
You cannot separate anyone

00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:25.750
as saying that they are condemned,
they are no good. Try to get them.

00:41:25.951 --> 00:41:30.660
With your forgiveness, with your sense
of chastity, things will improve.

00:41:30.861 --> 00:41:33.953
So this exclusiveness also should be
given up,

00:41:34.154 --> 00:41:38.629
which perhaps comes from a kind of a sense
of insecurity, I think.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.737
It is Shri Ganesha! If they are wrong type
of people, He drives them out.

00:41:42.938 --> 00:41:46.729
So don’t get frightened of them, and don’t
get upset with them.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:55.261
Try to be one, one, and try to be more
attracting people to yourself,

00:41:55.462 --> 00:42:00.825
keeping them to you, trying to manage them
and look after them.

00:42:01.026 --> 00:42:06.408
I hope you will all meditate now after this
to develop your Ganesha qualities,

00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:13.981
and develop that power of chastity,
and also of peace and security.

00:42:14.182 --> 00:42:16.246
May God bless you.
