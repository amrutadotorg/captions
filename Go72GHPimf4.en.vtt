00:14.659 --> 00:20.065
So now, let’s have it, the second question. Now what is it?

00:20.971 --> 00:24.408
Yogi: Mother, how can we please you best?

00:27.424 --> 00:31.198
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Gregoire: How can we please you best?

00:36.612 --> 00:38.581
I have no desires.

00:41.253 --> 00:42.690
I don’t know

00:57.261 --> 01:02.847
You see, inside me is complete peace and complete satisfaction.

01:10.237 --> 01:14.393
There is nothing that is needed inside.

01:17.339 --> 01:24.175
But the ripples of that joy flows outward all the time.

01:29.214 --> 01:34.237
And when it reaches your shores, you see, it comes back.

01:38.534 --> 01:42.237
And it weaves a beautiful pattern,

01:46.902 --> 01:49.221
and I see the pattern.

01:50.847 --> 01:54.815
The reciprocity, how much you reciprocate,

01:58.901 --> 02:02.675
is the way the pattern is beautiful.

02:10.604 --> 02:13.722
It’s delicate, it’s powerful.

02:17.683 --> 02:19.526
It’s so soothing

02:24.104 --> 02:29.442
and it weaves the complete beauty of bhakti.

02:37.729 --> 02:45.275
So much so that this ocean of joy itself gets turbulent,

02:51.284 --> 02:53.885
and I really swing with it.

02:58.104 --> 03:00.690
And it is not easy to describe

03:03.147 --> 03:07.942
that beautiful feeling of tremendous joy.

03:15.175 --> 03:18.495
The first thing you have to know

03:18.495 --> 03:20.909
that I love you very much,

03:24.143 --> 03:27.042
with all my heart, with all my soul.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.057
In the same way try to love me

03:36.966 --> 03:39.340
with all sincerity and trust.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.684
May God bless you all!
