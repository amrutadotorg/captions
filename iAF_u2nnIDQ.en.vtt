00:57.857 --> 01:01.531
Today, you are all celebrating my birthday.

01:03.730 --> 01:08.730
This is a matter of great satisfaction,

01:09.256 --> 01:13.736
as in this time of Kaliyuga, who celebrates the birthday of mother?

01:14.981 --> 01:18.693
This shows that though you all are

01:20.436 --> 01:22.865
born in this Kaliyuga,

01:23.452 --> 01:28.178
you don’t just know about your duty towards the mother,

01:28.631 --> 01:31.654
but you also follow it.

01:36.192 --> 01:37.168
At this age,

01:37.399 --> 01:41.379
To celebrate birthdays means, a year is getting deducted every year.

01:42.972 --> 01:46.543
and there are so many tasks still to be done.

01:47.464 --> 01:52.583
I can see many tasks,, which are incomplete

01:52.978 --> 01:55.549
We will have to work hard and pay attention to them,

01:55.716 --> 01:57.849
only then can they be completed.

02:05.215 --> 02:07.873
Like I said yesterday, in Delhi,

02:09.366 --> 02:13.519
we should pay attention to our culture.

02:14.717 --> 02:18.534
We should sort out our cultural state also.

02:20.553 --> 02:24.394
and the third thing which is very important,

02:25.045 --> 02:26.132
is that

02:26.509 --> 02:30.382
towards our spiritual ascent, we

02:33.567 --> 02:36.599
should pay not just the attention but as a

02:38.544 --> 02:45.302
martyr who is ready to sacrifice his life for his cause,

02:45.453 --> 02:50.810
same fervour we should have for the Sahaja Yoga.

02:52.459 --> 02:56.499
Until we have this sentiment within us,

02:56.729 --> 02:59.657
Sahaja Yoga is going to be only for our benefit.

02:59.973 --> 03:04.077
What are our benefts, what kind of happiness we got from this,

03:04.609 --> 03:07.513
is what I keep hearing all the time.

03:09.432 --> 03:12.868
Whatever we have benefited from it,

03:14.317 --> 03:16.275
whatever good has happened,

03:17.358 --> 03:24.112
is because of the only reason – that we have found your spirit.

03:24.655 --> 03:29.718
But when the light has come in you, you have become the lamp,

03:30.469 --> 03:33.445
then you can’t hide the lamp somewhere.

03:35.145 --> 03:37.542
You should bring your lamp out.

03:39.249 --> 03:43.471
And Sahaja yog, as I have said many times, is society-facing.

03:43.845 --> 03:46.917
Facing towards the society- that is Sahaja Yoga.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.942
The light that can’t be spread, is of no use.

03:52.952 --> 03:55.198
So every Sahaj yogi should think,

03:55.492 --> 04:02.261
"how and in which dimension or style have I spread Sahaja Yoga".

04:03.572 --> 04:06.905
Firstly, a sort of speciality should enter your personality.

04:08.076 --> 04:13.253
And on attaining this speciality, I have enlightened so many people.

04:15.547 --> 04:21.351
Today, when you embark on any task, in any country,

04:21.907 --> 04:25.456
the first question arises about the state of the people there.

04:26.067 --> 04:29.852
What are their vices, what are their conditionings,

04:30.171 --> 04:33.631
how much ego do they have? that is measured first.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.782
Then the consideration comes if this work can be achieved or not.

04:37.846 --> 04:40.321
The biggest problem is the human being.

04:40.805 --> 04:43.559
Even if the number of people is huge,

04:44.256 --> 04:48.608
if their state is not good, then no task can be  completed properly.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.832
Sahaja Yoga has done this greatest task,

04:53.046 --> 04:57.530
of transforming human beings, has changed humen so much.

04:58.795 --> 05:00.866
it has brought forth their ascent.

05:01.152 --> 05:06.381
Today, Sahaj yogis are honest, truthful, hard-working people.

05:06.779 --> 05:10.691
the kind of people which are very difficult to find in this country.

05:12.247 --> 05:16.048
Very rare type of people, who do what they say,

05:17.505 --> 05:20.512
They think what they know.

05:21.653 --> 05:24.534
Sahaj yoga has readied such rare type of people

05:24.852 --> 05:29.970
In this respect, Sahaj yoga is a massive blessing on this country.

05:31.404 --> 05:35.731
However, if you have these fine people,

05:36.462 --> 05:39.628
like a talented artisan, who is without any work,

05:39.700 --> 05:41.766
then this talent goes to waste.

05:43.003 --> 05:48.550
So, every Sahaj yogi has to think about "how I can use my talent".

05:49.859 --> 05:56.923
But, he also first thinks of his physical troubles and comfort

06:01.133 --> 06:03.696
Or he thinks how I can-

06:04.046 --> 06:06.053
I may have to spend money on this.

06:06.205 --> 06:09.879
or the expenditure may increase, how to manage that?

06:11.894 --> 06:15.973
In reality, you can not purchase joy, you can only experience it.

06:16.757 --> 06:20.384
But, whatever we obtain,

06:21.074 --> 06:26.582
or accept and adopt, get joy from it within us,

06:27.699 --> 06:33.381
is different and Sahaj Yoga is different.

06:35.691 --> 06:41.050
You get the joy here only by sharing it and there is no other way.

06:42.459 --> 06:46.117
For that you may have to bear some troubles

06:46.607 --> 06:48.487
face some problems,

06:48.655 --> 06:52.937
but they don’t seem like troubles because your spirit gets satisfied.

06:53.152 --> 06:55.802
Bodily comforts don’t matter to you anymore.

06:56.475 --> 06:58.307
You have to test yourself

06:58.736 --> 07:01.260
that when you become the spirit,

07:01.348 --> 07:05.427
when you share this light of the spirit with others,

07:05.530 --> 07:08.189
then you go beyond bodily comforts.

07:10.399 --> 07:13.541
You get so much joy of the spirit

07:13.809 --> 07:16.546
that in that joy of spirit,

07:18.071 --> 07:20.388
you get immersed completely.

07:21.072 --> 07:22.928
"Atmani atmana tushtah".

07:23.564 --> 07:25.738
spirit gets satisfied only by the spirit

07:25.818 --> 07:28.551
and does not require any other satisfaction.

07:29.056 --> 07:31.119
He doesn’t look for anything else.

07:31.215 --> 07:36.040
He gets so satisfied that He feels he’s drunk ambrosia.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.925
After having ambrosia, there is no need to have anything else.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.761
when you get this state,

07:43.913 --> 07:46.246
then you should know that you have become a Sahaj yogi,

07:46.357 --> 07:48.357
else you are still incomplete.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.589
Now You all know that I have become old

07:52.692 --> 07:56.550
and I have worked hard for 14 years tirelessly.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.700
You can say my penance is now complete.

08:00.225 --> 08:03.662
But, these last twelve years of hard work has been too much.

08:03.925 --> 08:08.213
It seems the hard work will have to continue for another 12 years.

08:08.942 --> 08:12.363
But, you have to see how much hard work you are putting in.

08:12.728 --> 08:15.595
Your mind will find one excuse or the other

08:15.752 --> 08:18.942
– that it can’t be done, I have my family,

08:19.173 --> 08:23.980
my children, my house, my this, my that.

08:24.310 --> 08:29.897
But, beyond all these things is the universe of joy.

08:29.993 --> 08:33.756
If you want to achieve that, then you should know that

08:33.852 --> 08:37.281
you have to fulfil the desire of your spirit.

08:37.968 --> 08:40.896
Until you don’t fulfil the desires of your spirit,

08:41.227 --> 08:43.544
all your desires will stay as they are

08:43.655 --> 08:45.727
and all your tasks will stay as they are.

08:45.933 --> 08:47.449
You can’t achieve anything,

08:47.584 --> 08:50.679
especially welfare, unless your yoga is fully established.

08:50.862 --> 08:55.921
But, as soon as your yoga takes place and gets established,

08:56.024 --> 08:59.335
you will notice that all your problems will be solved instantly.

08:59.463 --> 09:01.996
your problems have been solved, right?

09:02.558 --> 09:04.129
All of yours have!

09:04.747 --> 09:09.318
Then you move forward and see whtever we think is a problem for us,

09:09.763 --> 09:13.333
we think is very difficult for us,

09:14.214 --> 09:18.512
instead you just think "we are involved in the work of Sahaj yoga,

09:19.116 --> 09:21.383
and God is going to look after us,

09:22.277 --> 09:23.523
then you will find that

09:23.626 --> 09:28.856
all that you consider as problems will all disappear altogether.

09:30.088 --> 09:33.842
I told you once before that the Kundalini,

09:37.110 --> 09:42.871
remains beyond any cause and effect.

09:43.470 --> 09:46.311
And, When you rise in your Kundalini, then

09:46.779 --> 09:49.532
the cause gets omitted, as does the effect.

09:49.627 --> 09:52.912
When the cause is not there, effect also is not there.

09:53.670 --> 09:56.099
You have witnessed it.

09:56.257 --> 09:58.956
Many of you know that these things happen all the time.

09:59.251 --> 10:00.282
And it is happening.

10:00.354 --> 10:04.401
We’ve got the things we never imagined,

10:04.473 --> 10:06.222
we have achieved it.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.516
we have got so much happiness, we have got everything in Sahaj yoga,

10:10.867 --> 10:15.358
And even then if we are troubled about small-small things,

10:16.693 --> 10:18.978
then it will become a difficult situation.

10:19.198 --> 10:22.253
We should now think

10:22.468 --> 10:28.198
that we have found so much happiness, comfort and security

10:28.365 --> 10:29.587
and this Sahaj Yoga

10:29.754 --> 10:33.095
when we give to others, they can also achieve these things.

10:33.365 --> 10:37.341
But, when we give it to others, then we get more of it ourselves.

10:37.885 --> 10:42.511
There are many thousand messengers of God, at work for us.

10:44.877 --> 10:50.837
There are crores of hands, crores of their powers behind you all.

10:50.949 --> 10:54.639
If one person stands up to do the work of Sahaj Yoga,

10:54.776 --> 10:57.438
then you will not realise how things will happen,

10:57.494 --> 10:59.350
how things will get arranged,

10:59.449 --> 11:02.702
no one knows how things happen, but it will happen.

11:03.437 --> 11:05.683
But, first, you have to prepare yourself.

11:05.953 --> 11:10.818
because the deities which are inside you, know what you are?

11:11.564 --> 11:14.072
whether you are truthful or fake

11:14.517 --> 11:19.295
How high or low you are, they know everything.

11:19.974 --> 11:25.775
And until they are sure that you are fully dedicated,

11:26.267 --> 11:27.735
they will not help you.

11:28.134 --> 11:35.745
Once they know that you haven’t come just for your selfish reasons,

11:35.857 --> 11:40.269
but have come to do Sahaj yoga- which is society- facing-

11:40.918 --> 11:42.655
you have come to spread it,

11:42.854 --> 11:44.762
then you will be surprised that

11:44.866 --> 11:48.056
that you will be showered with blessings from all four directions,

11:48.159 --> 11:52.315
– like the whole atmosphere will become fragrant

11:52.395 --> 11:54.134
and you will feel light

11:54.302 --> 11:57.035
as if " I have no weight on my shoulders" everything is happening,

11:59.072 --> 12:02.008
and everything gets organised by itself.

12:03.626 --> 12:06.665
We have to come to that state.

12:07.086 --> 12:11.424
Then you can see every person can do a lot of work and spread Sahaja.

12:12.463 --> 12:17.954
I know that in Delhi, we still have to work a lot individually,

12:19.304 --> 12:21.113
and then collectively.

12:22.071 --> 12:23.023
It’s possible

12:23.087 --> 12:27.119
for you all to talk to your neighbours and relatives about it.

12:27.436 --> 12:29.443
You can call them all and tell them.

12:29.674 --> 12:33.157
In India we have a very nice arrangement where we have our children,

12:33.245 --> 12:36.045
our relatives, and acquaintances.

12:36.269 --> 12:37.982
we can talk to all of them about it.

12:38.047 --> 12:40.896
It is possible, among them Only a handful may believe in it.

12:41.055 --> 12:45.658
But, when they will see how your state and realise the change in you,

12:45.869 --> 12:48.138
then they will definitely make an effort.

12:48.218 --> 12:49.495
At least some will.

12:49.615 --> 12:53.646
In this manner, you can help spread Sahaj yoga.

12:54.451 --> 12:58.035
Every person, whether it’s a woman or a man or a child,

12:58.163 --> 13:01.694
every person when enlightened,

13:02.154 --> 13:05.375
has a right to establish in Yoga,

13:05.463 --> 13:09.463
but, it is their duty to give this light to others.

13:10.162 --> 13:13.034
You have the power and everything

13:13.176 --> 13:15.397
and if even then you didn’t give yoga to others,

13:15.525 --> 13:19.746
then I can’t say how appropriate that would be.

13:25.331 --> 13:29.129
In our Delhi centre,

13:29.667 --> 13:34.373
many questions have arisen about which I would like to talk.

13:34.495 --> 13:37.003
I will tell these people the problems we have

13:37.106 --> 13:41.784
and how you can obtain

13:44.054 --> 13:45.680
the solutions to these questions.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.133
It’s not a difficult task.

13:47.272 --> 13:50.382
However, what we think from our mind

13:50.486 --> 13:55.406
and any decisions we take based on our opinions,

13:55.579 --> 13:58.521
still, until we

13:58.672 --> 14:01.982
haven’t won over our Hamsa chakra and haven’t got the discretion,

14:02.062 --> 14:04.595
until we develop descretion within us,

14:04.870 --> 14:13.797
until we have the power to know what is right and wrong,

14:14.059 --> 14:18.567
anything we know what is beneficial for Sahaj yoga,

14:18.774 --> 14:23.559
until we develop the subtlity within us, to understand this,

14:23.751 --> 14:27.394
until then you haven’t completely achieved Sahaj yoga.

14:28.244 --> 14:30.395
How does that wisdom come?

14:30.490 --> 14:31.522
Some ask, how do you get it?

14:31.641 --> 14:34.887
How do you know you can ride a cycle? when you can actually ride it.

14:35.715 --> 14:38.643
How do you drive a motor car? When you start driving it!

14:38.937 --> 14:42.984
Similarly how does subtle intelligence come? Just when it comes!

14:45.431 --> 14:47.979
How does it come? By being indifferent to it.

14:48.265 --> 14:51.280
You start watching everything in a witness state, meditate,

14:51.436 --> 14:57.388
and spend your time thinking about Sahaj yoga, then it will come.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.622
But, how will it come, when will it happen?

15:01.932 --> 15:04.146
It will happen when it does happen.

15:04.885 --> 15:08.178
And if this hasn’t developed inside us yet,

15:08.298 --> 15:10.703
then we should try to achieve it.

15:10.791 --> 15:14.250
That’s why I said that now we should try really hard.

15:14.974 --> 15:16.656
We should try really hard.

15:17.057 --> 15:20.216
I had told them to invite only those people to the puja,

15:20.335 --> 15:23.303
who have actually achieved something, and

15:25.512 --> 15:31.681
(okay, wait, wait, now who ever has sent him, what do they understand? he is a child,)

15:32.103 --> 15:34.703
Anyone capable of achieving something,

15:35.038 --> 15:37.752
to give them is your paramount duty.

15:38.975 --> 15:43.085
On every birthday, you make some or other new resolution.

15:46.468 --> 15:51.397
Now, I understand that I should also make a new resolution.

15:53.130 --> 15:57.400
And the new resolution is that

15:58.965 --> 16:01.719
the Vishwa Dharma that We have made,

16:02.210 --> 16:05.758
the universal religion that We have established,

16:06.369 --> 16:07.809
and we all follow it,

16:09.279 --> 16:12.215
if whoever doesn’t follow its ‘Maryada’ (boundaries),

16:12.446 --> 16:14.708
such a person have no right to be called a Sahaj yogi.

16:14.859 --> 16:18.382
This is what I thought that we should all resolve.

16:20.573 --> 16:25.469
Anyone who follows its Maryada, only he/she can be its follower.

16:25.947 --> 16:29.653
Any follower of Vishwa dharma, who doesn’t live by it,

16:29.978 --> 16:32.637
then we can’t accept him/her as a Sahaj yogi.

16:32.856 --> 16:36.855
For example, if a person is Sahaja Yogi, and he takes dowry,

16:37.395 --> 16:39.372
then he can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

16:39.541 --> 16:43.398
Anyone believing in the caste system, can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

16:43.755 --> 16:47.223
Any person believing in class system can not be a SahajaYogi.

16:47.376 --> 16:51.598
So, Today I have decided that from today any person,

16:52.269 --> 16:54.173
who calls himself a Sahaj yogi,

16:54.269 --> 16:57.959
should have a complete understanding of Vishwa Dharma.

16:58.380 --> 17:03.261
Not only this, but if it doesn’t reflect in their behaviour,

17:03.347 --> 17:06.140
Supposing any sahaja Yogi behaves this way,

17:06.260 --> 17:08.849
then he has no right to be in Sahaj Yoga.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.008
He should be told that he should atone for his mistakes,

17:12.119 --> 17:15.224
and correct himself as part of their atonement,

17:15.446 --> 17:17.913
only then he can come to Sahaja Yoga.

17:18.756 --> 17:22.779
There is no problem if people say only fewer people are left.

17:23.565 --> 17:26.303
There is very less space left in God’s kingdom.

17:26.557 --> 17:28.097
You don’t know.

17:29.154 --> 17:32.021
How many people can you accommodate there?

17:32.646 --> 17:35.289
Even hell doesn’t have enough space.

17:38.262 --> 17:42.069
People will have to be kept somewhere in between only.

17:45.682 --> 17:48.777
That’s why, half baked people,

17:50.153 --> 17:52.417
who are good for nothing,

17:52.671 --> 17:55.012
shouldn’t come to Sahaj Yoga.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.423
There is no need to trouble us.

18:00.694 --> 18:04.440
People who come to Sahaj should follow it's protocol,

18:04.956 --> 18:08.831
and instil them in their behaviour, practice them,

18:09.179 --> 18:13.568
Tell your neighbours completely about it

18:13.873 --> 18:17.095
and say that we believe in universal religion,

18:17.468 --> 18:19.730
and not in any other religion.

18:21.135 --> 18:24.507
If yogis don’t say that then we can’t accept them as yogis.

18:24.675 --> 18:28.549
people who are scared to tell people in their society that

18:28.867 --> 18:30.934
they are Yogis of Vishwa Dharma,

18:31.232 --> 18:34.880
people who are afraid to tell that they are Sahaja Yogis,

18:35.663 --> 18:38.647
Sahaja Yoga is not available for such people.

18:39.323 --> 18:43.799
You will have to fully follow the protocols of Sahaj yoga.

18:44.369 --> 18:45.988
Like, many people are there

18:46.123 --> 18:50.044
who tell that that ‘Mother, we sometimes drink a little alcohol,

18:50.637 --> 18:53.835
smoke a little, consume tobacco also’,

18:54.264 --> 18:56.331
Then you can not be a Sahaj yogi.

18:56.659 --> 19:01.198
If a person doesn’t follow the Maryada of Sahaj yoga,

19:01.460 --> 19:03.655
then he can not follow a universal religion.

19:03.853 --> 19:05.987
And this Universal relegion of ours,

19:06.376 --> 19:10.439
we must keep completely pure as it’s not just a universal religion,

19:10.663 --> 19:12.639
but Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

19:12.758 --> 19:15.646
I can’t allow any impurity to creep in,

19:15.814 --> 19:18.694
That’s why anyone impure, can’t come into it.

19:20.075 --> 19:26.007
Only those people who have fully accepted this universal religion

19:26.176 --> 19:28.310
and follow the protocol can stay in it.

19:28.628 --> 19:32.786
This is the resolution I have made for my birthday

19:32.929 --> 19:37.211
and I hope you will accept it with love.

19:40.871 --> 19:44.455
Now, about the specialities of this universal religion,

19:45.153 --> 19:48.827
how should it be and what is its depth-

19:49.010 --> 19:51.416
– all this, I will tell you on some other day.

19:51.782 --> 19:58.139
But, for now, you mustn’t do things that you roughly know to be wrong,

19:59.598 --> 20:00.598
Things

20:02.455 --> 20:05.224
even in the normal light,

20:05.367 --> 20:12.682
if you can see that, is not Sahaj, that thing you cannot do.

20:13.776 --> 20:17.633
And If you can’t get rid of these things, then you must spare Me.

20:18.268 --> 20:19.788
I can’t fight you.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.703
I have seen many people come just to get cured.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.768
Then they will come with the second disease, then the third.

20:27.967 --> 20:31.109
The reason is after being cured once, you should become Sahaj.

20:31.269 --> 20:34.863
If you don’t become Sahaj, and after that you become a-Sahaj,

20:35.060 --> 20:36.996
then you become ill yet again.

20:37.624 --> 20:38.965
Again you become sick.

20:39.092 --> 20:42.752
Do I keep washing you like a washerman the whole life?

20:44.356 --> 20:46.935
So, you should also keep yourself pure,

20:47.063 --> 20:50.853
and should follow this religion like it’s our ornament,

20:50.996 --> 20:54.218
this is our glory, our speciality,

20:54.329 --> 20:58.059
This is why we are sitting in a high pedestal in the world.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.764
Every part of our body should have this thought.

21:02.471 --> 21:05.050
From each core of body the vibrations flow.

21:05.185 --> 21:10.353
You should understand that God is so eager to decorate you with this,

21:10.565 --> 21:13.457
But, how aware you are about it,

21:13.648 --> 21:17.560
and how much you are ready for this, you should know.

21:19.769 --> 21:22.975
I tell you as much as I can.

21:23.263 --> 21:25.493
Now, the yardstick is

21:25.612 --> 21:29.064
that unless you follow the religion of Sahaj yoga,

21:29.251 --> 21:33.814
you can’t enter Sahaja Yoga and you don’t have a right to pujas.

21:35.852 --> 21:38.003
and you will have no right to anything else.

21:38.203 --> 21:43.123
Whoever stays in the Maryada, only will have this right.

21:43.226 --> 21:46.387
We might have only 4-5 people left, but doesn’t matter.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.035
That will make things easier.

21:51.872 --> 21:54.761
You should be very aware towards this,

21:54.865 --> 22:00.076
make your life such that you all are together

22:00.188 --> 22:04.600
and attain the meaning of your self, and be with one another.

22:04.884 --> 22:07.439
And with that, you should become capable.

22:07.662 --> 22:13.098
This is my blessing to you that you all should realise your powers

22:13.455 --> 22:17.375
and then nourish the whole world with this power of love.

22:23.924 --> 22:27.599
Since, today is my birthday, the puja will not be a long one.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.413
A simple puja is going to happen,

22:29.509 --> 22:32.503
first of all, with names of shri Ganesha My feet will be washed,

22:32.647 --> 22:34.342
and with that nectar of the feet will be made. (charanamrit)

22:34.462 --> 22:37.541
After that My feet will be washed with water,

22:37.833 --> 22:39.992
and that water will be theerth.(Holy water)

22:40.087 --> 22:43.126
And after that I will prepare the charanamrit using My hands,

22:43.556 --> 22:47.029
and at that time 108 names of Devi will be taken.

22:47.101 --> 22:50.060
That's it. There will not be much puja.

22:52.436 --> 22:55.602
Does everybody has the 108 names?

22:57.754 --> 22:58.483
Ganesha's name?

22:58.659 --> 23:01.684
No, no. Devi's name.

23:01.796 --> 23:04.319
Devi;s name. Distribute 108 names .

23:06.549 --> 23:07.033
What?

23:07.319 --> 23:09.586
You have it but do others have it?

23:10.877 --> 23:12.567
Does Everybody have it?

23:13.875 --> 23:16.478
Have you got printed?

23:19.545 --> 23:21.745
But now, they don't have that now, just now.

23:24.247 --> 23:27.722
Okay now, among the 108 names,

23:27.921 --> 23:29.722
He will tell you the first name,

23:29.921 --> 23:32.655
then you convert it intio mantra and say.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.309
Then you convert it into mantra and say.
