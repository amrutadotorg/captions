00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,614
1991-09-01 Shri Krishna puja - The technique of the play, Cabella, Italy

2
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:07,077
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

3
00:04:08,377 --> 00:04:15,277
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

4
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:21,177
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

5
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:27,010
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

6
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,110
But also yoga has another meaning which means yukti.

7
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,010
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

8
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:43,876
We can call it as... Yukti means the trick.

9
00:04:44,177 --> 00:04:53,010
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

10
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,243
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

11
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,910
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

12
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:09,843
But one can say it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

13
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,910
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

14
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:21,910
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

15
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:28,910
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

16
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:37,277
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

17
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:41,910
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

18
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,943
At Krishna's level when we reach

19
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,910
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

20
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:59,143
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

21
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:13,910
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

22
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:22,910
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

23
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:27,177
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

24
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:34,910
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

25
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:46,377
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

26
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:51,077
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

27
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,410
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

28
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,943
So Shri Krishna had to come -

29
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,410
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

30
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:10,910
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

31
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:22,377
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

32
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:28,910
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

33
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,910
you have electrical communications.

34
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:38,277
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

35
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,343
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

36
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:47,910
Supposing only you know all the technique,

37
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:52,910
then it becomes quite a headache,

38
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:56,910
because all the time you think you are doing it.

39
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,277
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

40
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,910
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

41
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,043
You get tired and bored.

42
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:17,043
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

43
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:23,910
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

44
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:30,910
And that is what is Leela, that's why He is called 'Leeladhara' -

45
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:37,910
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

46
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:46,910
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

47
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:59,910
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

48
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:07,177
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

49
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,910
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

50
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:20,910
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

51
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,343
In the morning you get up.

52
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:33,177
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

53
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:39,243
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

54
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:44,910
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

55
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:50,876
And at that time you sit down for your dhyaan.

56
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:58,876
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

57
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,143
But for that you have to be a master.

58
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,910
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

59
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,177
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

60
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:19,910
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

61
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,910
so that it becomes your play.

62
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:35,910
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

63
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:45,143
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

64
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,143
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

65
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:55,310
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

66
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,910
It looks, very childlike.

67
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:07,910
Like when the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

68
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:11,343
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

69
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:16,876
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

70
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,910
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

71
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:27,843
He's sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

72
00:11:29,077 --> 00:11:34,910
They're coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

73
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,910
Already there are vibrations, you see - raising their Kundalini.

74
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:50,976
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

75
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,843
which have also got vibrated water in.

76
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:59,976
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

77
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,110
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

78
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:09,310
See the play of a child,

79
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,910
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

80
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:25,910
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

81
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:32,343
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

82
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,143
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' .

83
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:42,110
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

84
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,343
So the "Dha Re Di Sa Dharmaha"  as they say.

85
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,910
In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

86
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:59,210
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

87
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:04,077
I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

88
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:11,143
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

89
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:14,143
Just feel very happy.

90
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,910
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

91
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:25,910
for joy or at the most happiness.

92
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:29,976
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

93
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:35,910
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

94
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:38,910
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

95
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,910
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

96
00:13:42,143 --> 00:13:49,177
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

97
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,976
to all the people with whom He was connected.

98
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:58,910
So all the Gopas and Gopis who were with Him had to do Rasa.

99
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,910
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

100
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:05,876
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

101
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,043
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

102
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,077
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

103
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:19,910
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

104
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,843
So this was another play that He had.

105
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,910
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

106
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,110
But in modern times it's very difficult,

107
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,876
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

108
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:50,177
I mean, nobody will understand also.

109
00:14:53,077 --> 00:14:59,910
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

110
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:03,243
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

111
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:08,077
and also empowering the person with

112
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:13,210
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

113
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,410
And that's why we had to find out these methods

114
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,910
by which we could give realization to people.

115
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:30,876
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

116
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,910
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

117
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,876
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

118
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,910
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

119
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,177
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

120
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:55,210
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

121
00:15:56,876 --> 00:16:04,043
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

122
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:12,976
The first is that His character was 'madhuriya', meaning the sweetness.

123
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:20,910
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

124
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:29,910
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

125
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:39,910
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

126
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:46,910
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

127
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:54,243
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

128
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,876
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

129
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:08,910
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

130
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:15,910
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

131
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,110
the communication between human beings

132
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,010
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

133
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,910
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

134
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,110
which is not true.

135
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:39,177
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

136
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:46,910
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

137
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,077
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

138
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,843
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

139
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:04,910
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

140
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:12,910
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

141
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,110
that trick one has to learn:

142
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:25,343
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

143
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,177
This is one of His special qualities,

144
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:36,243
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

145
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:40,910
in a very sweet manner, and

146
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:50,143
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

147
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,910
Now there are many tricks

148
00:18:54,377 --> 00:19:00,910
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

149
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,110
First of all you must always show

150
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:08,910
that you are less intelligent than another person.

151
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:17,143
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

152
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,910
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

153
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:28,910
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

154
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:41,243
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

155
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:47,910
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

156
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:51,243
Musician feels very happy.

157
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:55,910
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

158
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,910
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

159
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,910
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

160
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,110
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

161
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:23,910
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

162
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:34,310
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

163
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,910
but I would like to hear" this is first.

164
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,243
The first quality of communication is to be

165
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,243
extremely humble about yourself.

166
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,910
The other person should not know who you are.

167
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:56,910
And there's a lot of fun in it.

168
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:03,943
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

169
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:08,243
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

170
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,910
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

171
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,910
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

172
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,910
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

173
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,843
just a useless, small, little place

174
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:27,910
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

175
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,077
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

176
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,077
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

177
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:38,077
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

178
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:45,976
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

179
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:48,910
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

180
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,043
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

181
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:56,876
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

182
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:59,143
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

183
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,910
She had started looking down upon Me,

184
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,910
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

185
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:17,910
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

186
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:21,043
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

187
00:22:21,077 --> 00:22:25,910
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

188
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,910
This boastfullness is of no use.

189
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:33,410
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

190
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,910
But if you want I can try."

191
00:22:42,177 --> 00:22:51,277
So play down as much as you can. Practice this at home,

192
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,910
first practice and then do it.

193
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:02,843
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

194
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:08,943
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

195
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,177
there's one is very important thing.

196
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:13,010
He says "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

197
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:18,010
You see among all the worst things that we have -

198
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:22,910
according to Him we have six enemies.

199
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:29,043
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

200
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,910
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

201
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:41,277
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

202
00:23:42,277 --> 00:23:47,910
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

203
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,077
He can make you dance like this.

204
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:54,910
What is the need to lose your temper?

205
00:23:56,243 --> 00:24:00,243
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

206
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:05,277
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

207
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,243
and something starts barking,

208
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,077
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

209
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:22,843
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

210
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,343
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

211
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:33,910
from one to another to another to another.

212
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:38,243
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

213
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:49,210
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

214
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:52,010
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

215
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,910
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

216
00:24:56,243 --> 00:25:01,143
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

217
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,343
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

218
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:12,910
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

219
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:16,043
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

220
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:21,310
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

221
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,910
Many people I have seen people say

222
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,177
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

223
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:29,277
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

224
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,110
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

225
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,177
No, no I'm very good."

226
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:40,910
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

227
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,910
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

228
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:51,910
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

229
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,910
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

230
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,910
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

231
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,077
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

232
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,110
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

233
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:17,243
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

234
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,910
There is no need to take to temper.

235
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,077
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

236
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,410
Why are you doing that way?"

237
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,910
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

238
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,910
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

239
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:37,910
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

240
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,910
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

241
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:50,177
If you just stop at a point,

242
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,910
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

243
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,177
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

244
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,910
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

245
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,910
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

246
00:27:08,177 --> 00:27:12,177
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

247
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:17,310
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

248
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,910
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

249
00:27:23,343 --> 00:27:29,010
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

250
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,377
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

251
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:38,043
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

252
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:42,010
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

253
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:49,843
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

254
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,910
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

255
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,910
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

256
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,910
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

257
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:10,077
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

258
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,310
you'll never feel guilty.

259
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:16,910
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

260
00:28:17,177 --> 00:28:19,843
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

261
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:24,110
Next time you won't do it.

262
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:29,243
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

263
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:36,243
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

264
00:28:37,876 --> 00:28:38,910
And I'm very much worried about

265
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,910
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

266
00:28:45,043 --> 00:28:49,210
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

267
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:54,910
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

268
00:28:56,343 --> 00:29:01,976
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

269
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,876
and when you touch them it becomes water.

270
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:13,177
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

271
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,143
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

272
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:22,910
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

273
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:28,343
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

274
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,377
But women don't, they keep it there

275
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,243
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

276
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,377
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

277
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:45,976
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

278
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,910
but it's tears just to impress another person that

279
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,910
you are very sad or something.

280
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:08,943
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

281
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:12,910
and the third one is how to master

282
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:19,910
the temper of others - that's even better.

283
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:24,843
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

284
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,910
Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him.

285
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:31,843
He is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

286
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:33,910
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

287
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:35,910
so he was sitting in the water

288
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:41,277
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

289
00:30:41,343 --> 00:30:43,843
I never saw the tiger, of course.

290
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:47,143
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

291
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:49,143
so I went to see him.

292
00:30:49,343 --> 00:30:54,910
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

293
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,943
for about one and a half hours.

294
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:01,876
And as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

295
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:05,143
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

296
00:31:06,077 --> 00:31:08,043
so he felt very challenged!

297
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:12,177
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

298
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,910
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

299
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,943
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

300
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:23,343
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

301
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,910
He touched my feet, everything he did and then he said,

302
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,910
"You tell me now - why did you not allow me to stop the water?

303
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,177
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know.

304
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:41,976
But why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

305
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:46,876
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

306
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:55,077
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

307
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,243
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

308
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:02,876
that too of an orange colour, and I would

309
00:32:02,943 --> 00:32:05,243
not take the orange colour sari from you.

310
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,210
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

311
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,910
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

312
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:19,910
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master.

313
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:31,377
First of all how to melt him and secondly the master of his mind.

314
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:39,110
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

315
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,177
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

316
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:48,310
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

317
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,910
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

318
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:56,177
But if you try just to know about a person -

319
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,910
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

320
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:04,910
So first try to understand a person.

321
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:10,177
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

322
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:14,010
and a very humorous person.

323
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:17,910
And one day My brother told me, Babamama,

324
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,910
that he has a friend who sings very well.

325
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:24,110
So I asked my father "How does he sing?"

326
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,277
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

327
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,043
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

328
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,843
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

329
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:39,343
"He's very courageous you see.

330
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:42,343
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

331
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:46,410
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him -

332
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,177
he said "He's courageous" -

333
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,910
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

334
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,077
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

335
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,910
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

336
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:02,910
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

337
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,910
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

338
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:13,910
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

339
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,910
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

340
00:34:18,043 --> 00:34:21,910
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

341
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:30,910
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

342
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,910
with all his qualities, with everything

343
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:36,910
and accepting that person as he is.

344
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,110
If that mastery you can have.

345
00:34:41,876 --> 00:34:45,943
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

346
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:49,976
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

347
00:34:51,976 --> 00:34:57,010
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

348
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:02,010
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

349
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:07,110
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

350
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:14,110
Little additional swara (musical note) is added to his character.

351
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:20,110
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You'll really enjoy.

352
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,210
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

353
00:35:24,876 --> 00:35:27,077
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

354
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,043
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

355
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,343
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

356
00:35:32,876 --> 00:35:38,910
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

357
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:45,377
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

358
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:51,910
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

359
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,377
or the defects of that person.

360
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,444
But you need not say directly something to him.

361
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,243
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

362
00:36:07,243 --> 00:36:09,243
that the person will understand.

363
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:18,010
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

364
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:25,077
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

365
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,410
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

366
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:32,444
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

367
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:38,110
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

368
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:42,444
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

369
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:50,943
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

370
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,143
that's no good.

371
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:57,910
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

372
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,177
but you are lost forever for that person.

373
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,910
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

374
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:09,243
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:13,910
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

376
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,177
that it doesn't hurt the person,

377
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:24,910
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

378
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,910
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

379
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:41,910
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

380
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,243
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

381
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:51,943
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

382
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:56,077
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

383
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:00,510
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

384
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:05,077
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

385
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:12,910
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

386
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:16,043
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

387
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,077
For example, if you want to say that:

388
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,976
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

389
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,077
should be there at the right time.

390
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:27,143
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

391
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:30,444
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

392
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,177
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

393
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:36,910
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

394
00:38:38,243 --> 00:38:41,843
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

395
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:45,077
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

396
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:50,010
for the time being. So transfer it.

397
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:57,110
And this transference is 'astantar' as they call it.

398
00:38:57,277 --> 00:39:04,043
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

399
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,910
There is a story about Him.

400
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,910
He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

401
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,043
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

402
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:23,243
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

403
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,143
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

404
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,910
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

405
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,910
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

406
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,377
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

407
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:46,110
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

408
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:52,843
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

409
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:58,910
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

410
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,943
and if I open my eyes

411
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:06,943
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma."

412
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:13,343
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

413
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:18,143
So He started running away from the field.

414
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:21,143
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

415
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:29,177
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

416
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:35,910
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

417
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,910
and hid himself in the cave.

418
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:45,243
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

419
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:48,010
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

420
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,143
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

421
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,876
And he started waking [him] up.

422
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:59,243
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

423
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:07,943
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

424
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,444
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

425
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,444
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

426
00:41:20,043 --> 00:41:24,243
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

427
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:30,477
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

428
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,943
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

429
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:40,043
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

430
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:45,110
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

431
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:50,477
And so many tricks He played.

432
00:41:56,377 --> 00:42:04,277
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

433
00:42:04,943 --> 00:42:11,910
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

434
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:25,110
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

435
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,910
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

436
00:42:32,444 --> 00:42:34,243
He told Arjuna not himself;

437
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:40,910
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - Sarathi.

438
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:49,343
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

439
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:55,843
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

440
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:08,243
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

441
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:14,210
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

442
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:23,243
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

443
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:27,110
How are you going to save them?

444
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:34,010
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

445
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,343
while Arjuna was his disciple.

446
00:43:38,444 --> 00:44:04,277
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

447
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:08,210
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

448
00:44:08,444 --> 00:44:17,477
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

449
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:22,377
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

450
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,910
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

451
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:33,077
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

452
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,976
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

453
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:46,976
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

454
00:44:48,976 --> 00:44:53,110
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

455
00:44:54,377 --> 00:45:00,043
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

456
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:02,243
To get rid of the ill -

457
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:06,077
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

458
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:11,043
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

459
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,943
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

460
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:21,943
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

461
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:24,976
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

462
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:29,444
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

463
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:36,177
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

464
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:41,876
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

465
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:46,876
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

466
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:51,510
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

467
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:57,110
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

468
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:04,110
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

469
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,343
Without weapons also He can do everything.

470
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:12,910
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

471
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:21,910
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

472
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:26,110
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

473
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:30,843
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

474
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,077
because I don't want them to see.

475
00:46:33,277 --> 00:46:38,010
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

476
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,910
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

477
00:46:42,477 --> 00:46:44,976
and you know what they are playing with you.

478
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:50,444
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

479
00:46:50,843 --> 00:46:55,243
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

480
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:01,077
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

481
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,143
will improve very much with others.

482
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,343
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

483
00:47:10,943 --> 00:47:17,077
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

484
00:47:18,143 --> 00:47:20,010
What is bhootish?"

485
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:24,043
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

486
00:47:24,243 --> 00:47:28,876
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

487
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,210
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

488
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:39,177
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

489
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,910
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

490
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:47,943
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

491
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:52,077
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

492
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:54,843
then it's even more important.

493
00:47:55,077 --> 00:47:58,043
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

494
00:47:58,077 --> 00:47:59,910
We'll have to take it out."

495
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:05,143
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

496
00:48:05,177 --> 00:48:09,444
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

497
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,243
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

498
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:15,110
because you know he is cunning.

499
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,510
What's the use of playing with that?

500
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:20,343
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

501
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,910
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

502
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:32,976
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

503
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,177
Not the whole world.

504
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:41,110
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

505
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:47,310
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

506
00:48:48,043 --> 00:48:50,143
It's not meant for ordinary people.

507
00:48:50,976 --> 00:48:55,910
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

508
00:48:56,043 --> 00:49:00,243
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

509
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:04,110
and we find that they create problems for us.

510
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,943
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

511
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,177
as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and Gopis;

512
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:19,243
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

513
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:26,310
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

514
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:31,477
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

515
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,243
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

516
00:49:36,177 --> 00:49:40,143
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

517
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:46,010
And He did it because He was such a master.

518
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:51,444
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

519
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:54,110
to master himself, because He knew himself,

520
00:49:54,277 --> 00:49:58,310
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

521
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:01,143
When you know everything

522
00:50:01,243 --> 00:50:04,243
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

523
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:09,110
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

524
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:19,910
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

525
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:24,444
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

526
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,910
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

527
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:37,277
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

528
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:43,343
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

529
00:50:44,143 --> 00:50:46,444
As I must have told you so many examples

530
00:50:46,976 --> 00:50:48,943
that the western negativity is like this

531
00:50:48,943 --> 00:50:53,310
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

532
00:50:55,143 --> 00:50:58,210
They don't like to work anyway.

533
00:50:58,377 --> 00:51:06,077
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

534
00:51:06,444 --> 00:51:09,910
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

535
00:51:10,077 --> 00:51:15,177
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

536
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:19,243
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

537
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:25,243
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

538
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:30,910
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

539
00:51:31,077 --> 00:51:35,210
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

540
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,943
Except for your brain everything works.

541
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,343
But the other way around it is:

542
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:46,943
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

543
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:51,110
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

544
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:57,210
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

545
00:51:58,843 --> 00:52:01,110
I must do something."

546
00:52:01,976 --> 00:52:05,077
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

547
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:11,177
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

548
00:52:12,277 --> 00:52:14,910
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

549
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,110
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

550
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,477
if that is not available do this.

551
00:52:20,043 --> 00:52:23,444
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

552
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:30,177
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

553
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,310
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

554
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:37,910
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

555
00:52:38,444 --> 00:52:40,910
the Master of Masters we should say.

556
00:52:41,143 --> 00:52:47,910
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

557
00:52:48,943 --> 00:52:50,477
She thought of Shri Krishna.

558
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:56,277
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

559
00:52:56,444 --> 00:52:58,943
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

560
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:02,243
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

561
00:53:02,876 --> 00:53:04,910
So She was holding on.

562
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:08,077
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

563
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:15,976
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

564
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:25,077
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

565
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:30,910
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

566
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:37,010
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

567
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:41,277
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

568
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:51,243
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

569
00:53:52,843 --> 00:53:55,943
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

570
00:53:56,177 --> 00:53:59,943
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

571
00:54:00,143 --> 00:54:05,910
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

572
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,343
to save the chastity of His sister -

573
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:15,077
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

574
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:20,277
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

575
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:28,210
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

576
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,143
which are too many!

577
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:36,410
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

578
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:40,110
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

579
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,343
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

580
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,410
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

581
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:55,876
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

582
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:01,177
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

583
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:06,843
But if you believe in yourself

584
00:55:07,277 --> 00:55:14,310
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

585
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:20,910
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

586
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:28,410
then I'm sure you can become masters.

587
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,943
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

588
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,110
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

589
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:41,110
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

590
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,910
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

591
00:55:45,077 --> 00:55:46,943
Nobody has been to university.

592
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,210
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

593
00:55:54,377 --> 00:55:57,010
Krishna never went into university,

594
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:01,876
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

595
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,077
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

596
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,110
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

597
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,910
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

598
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:18,876
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

599
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,976
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

600
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,077
what will it look like?

601
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,410
But it's not that you dominate

602
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:33,910
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

603
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:39,143
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

604
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,976
This is the mastery you have to get.

605
00:56:42,243 --> 00:56:46,510
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

606
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,277
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

607
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,910
is that we have to master ourselves.

608
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:54,644
But then immediately people say

609
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:00,043
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

610
00:57:02,143 --> 00:57:04,143
I can't understand this.

611
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:09,910
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

612
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:16,210
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

613
00:57:16,644 --> 00:57:22,444
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

614
00:57:22,577 --> 00:57:24,910
why can't you correct your own property?

615
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:27,910
It should be the easiest thing to do

616
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:31,010
but you're not sure that this is your own,

617
00:57:31,277 --> 00:57:34,943
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

618
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:39,444
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

619
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:44,577
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

620
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:50,910
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

621
00:57:52,976 --> 00:57:55,544
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

622
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,077
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

623
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:06,843
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

624
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:11,277
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

625
00:58:11,577 --> 00:58:14,544
This is happening? Put it that way.

626
00:58:15,177 --> 00:58:19,910
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

627
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:23,310
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

628
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:29,377
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

629
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:33,143
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

630
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:38,310
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

631
00:58:38,343 --> 00:58:41,243
the whole world, to emancipate them.

632
00:58:41,377 --> 00:58:44,210
To bring them out of their ignorance.

633
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:47,943
So for that we have to develop this mastery

634
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:53,277
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

635
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,910
but this mastery has to be developed.

636
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:00,043
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

637
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:04,910
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

638
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:08,943
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

639
00:59:09,277 --> 00:59:14,910
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

640
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,910
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

641
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:26,477
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

642
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:31,143
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

643
00:59:31,377 --> 00:59:34,910
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

644
00:59:37,876 --> 00:59:40,544
And the last, but not the least,

645
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:49,943
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

646
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:59,910
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

647
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,243
In these three forms you should see yourself.

648
01:00:04,577 --> 01:00:10,610
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

649
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:14,077
how I'm acting here!"

650
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,210
Then you become the spectator also.

651
01:00:17,644 --> 01:00:20,910
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

652
01:00:21,544 --> 01:00:25,976
then you will realize what you are doing,

653
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:29,544
how you are working out everything.

654
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:35,910
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

655
01:00:36,876 --> 01:00:38,410
will just run away.

656
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:42,910
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

657
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,910
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

658
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:51,910
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

659
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:58,910
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

660
01:00:59,377 --> 01:01:01,310
"let me face it."

661
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:05,610
But also there is another way out, people find out.

662
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,610
I mean, there are ways and ways.

663
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:11,876
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

664
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:14,243
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

665
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:18,177
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

666
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:21,910
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

667
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:27,243
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

668
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,077
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

669
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:36,277
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

670
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:40,077
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

671
01:01:40,243 --> 01:01:42,243
So what next?

672
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,177
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

673
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,843
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

674
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:54,577
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

675
01:01:54,876 --> 01:02:00,510
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

676
01:02:00,943 --> 01:02:03,544
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

677
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:09,910
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

678
01:02:10,544 --> 01:02:16,143
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

679
01:02:16,544 --> 01:02:21,210
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

680
01:02:24,177 --> 01:02:30,210
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

681
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:35,910
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

682
01:02:36,077 --> 01:02:41,243
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

683
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:43,210
you can correct yourself.

684
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:49,177
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

685
01:02:49,644 --> 01:02:53,410
and you are so detached that you can see it.

686
01:02:53,910 --> 01:03:02,010
The attachment to all the things are finished

687
01:03:02,343 --> 01:03:07,010
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

688
01:03:07,077 --> 01:03:10,477
and acting on these attachments also.

689
01:03:11,143 --> 01:03:19,043
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

690
01:03:19,277 --> 01:03:22,410
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

691
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:25,410
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

692
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,910
It's the other way around.

693
01:03:28,077 --> 01:03:31,277
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

694
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:34,910
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

695
01:03:35,876 --> 01:03:41,077
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

696
01:03:41,143 --> 01:03:45,976
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

697
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:49,043
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

698
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:55,143
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

699
01:03:55,177 --> 01:03:57,510
I'm talking at the time of peace.

700
01:03:58,444 --> 01:04:03,843
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

701
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,377
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

702
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:11,010
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

703
01:04:11,243 --> 01:04:16,510
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

704
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:19,910
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

705
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:21,910
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

706
01:04:21,943 --> 01:04:24,110
but you are part and parcel of it.

707
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,277
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

708
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:34,510
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

709
01:04:35,277 --> 01:04:39,577
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

710
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:45,510
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

711
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:49,010
and be one with the body of the Virata.

712
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:53,110
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

713
01:04:53,377 --> 01:04:58,410
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

714
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:02,577
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

715
01:05:03,177 --> 01:05:09,610
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

716
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,077
that you should have for all the other people

717
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,544
and immediately they'll recognize.

718
01:05:15,843 --> 01:05:18,910
I have seen small children are like that.

719
01:05:19,444 --> 01:05:22,077
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

720
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:24,077
They see their parents and this and that.

721
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:30,110
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

722
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:33,177
after all God is there to look after you."

723
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:40,843
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

724
01:05:40,943 --> 01:05:42,910
they will neutralize the whole thing.

725
01:05:43,077 --> 01:05:45,910
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

726
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,910
from all the little babies that we have

727
01:05:49,043 --> 01:05:55,910
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

728
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,544
with innocence we should work it out.

729
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,577
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

730
01:06:03,177 --> 01:06:07,010
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

731
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:10,510
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

732
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:14,910
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

733
01:06:15,043 --> 01:06:18,077
May God bless you.
