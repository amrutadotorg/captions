1
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:33,999
At the very outset I would like to apologize for being so late today

2
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:38,917
but I realized that

3
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,083
that when something is very important

4
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,750
from God’s point of view,

5
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,959
all the negative forces work out their plans,

6
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:53,333
how to delay, how to put obstructions,

7
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,917
how to bring hindrances, how to deviate.

8
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,500
It’s very surprising.

9
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:05,125
And today, I think would be best if I tell you

10
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,417
about God’s will and how we human beings

11
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,208
try to go against it all the time.

12
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,250
God’s will is extremely simple.

13
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,250
He is

14
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:35,667
Divine Love.

15
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,542
He is Compassion.

16
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,542
He is Ocean of Mercy.

17
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:52,208
And in His mercy and in compassion He created this world,

18
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,750
and then created human beings,

19
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,959
just to give them

20
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:04,083
the highest thing in life: joy.

21
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,834
Joy, which is single thing;

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,500
it does not have duality,

23
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,583
like sorrow, unhappiness,

24
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,625
like day and night.

25
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:28,208
But how we are anti-joy

26
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:34,417
and anti-God,

27
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,667
and why it happens, we’ll have to see that.

28
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,500
Our awareness, as you know, grows

29
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,000
through our brain,

30
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,208
downward;

31
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:54,999
and whatever starts growing downward,

32
00:02:55,166 --> 00:03:01,125
makes us away from God,

33
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,500
in a way.

34
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,500
Ultimately we have to achieve God,

35
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,166
but first we go little bit away from that awareness

36
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,542
of being one with God,

37
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,041
just to understand that freedom

38
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,208
has to be used properly.

39
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:28,542
Without that training, without that education,

40
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,542
no use giving freedom to human beings.

41
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,959
You have seen the “free” countries, what have they achieved?

42
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,709
In their freedom, what have we achieved?

43
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:44,083
Atom bombs to kill ourselves! I mean it is stupid,

44
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,625
it’s foolish, it's absurd!

45
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,917
But we have done it, and we are proud of it,

46
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,875
and still we are busy how to make it

47
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,166
even worse and worse and worse, but what's that?

48
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,291
This is how we move.

49
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:04,333
The awareness that was our own human awareness

50
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:09,000
was given to us for freedom,

51
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,166
to be tested, to be experimented, to be seen —

52
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,875
and then to have ultimate freedom

53
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,500
by which you become the Spirit.

54
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,709
You have to become the Spirit ultimately.

55
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:29,250
But as we start growing in our awareness, so-called,

56
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:34,333
our concern is not for the Spirit.

57
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,999
I would say, like a tree,

58
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:41,875
which embeds itself into its roots.

59
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,709
And the roots that we have are in the brain.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,375
And then we start growing,

61
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,792
upward, upward, and upward,

62
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,500
till the leaves are created, fruits are created,

63
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,709
flowers are created.

64
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:06,250
On the contrary, before reaching the fruit stage,

65
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:13,999
what happens to us - that we start creating artificial leaves

66
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,208
and enjoying them.

67
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,458
We take to artificiality.

68
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:23,625
Once this identification of artificiality starts,

69
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:27,875
we start going away from reality

70
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,917
to negative thoughts, or to over-positive thoughts

71
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,792
by which we make atom bombs and all that —

72
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:41,291
so-called positive thoughts, which are actually anti-God.

73
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:46,834
So there are two branches really

74
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,834
in life that we branch off.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,875
Some people like to go towards the left side of negative attitude,

76
00:05:56,041 --> 00:06:02,041
by which they injure themselves, trouble themselves,

77
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:06,542
do all kinds of things by which they can die,

78
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,041
in the most miserable manner;

79
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,959
get all kinds of diseases upon themselves,

80
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:17,625
torture their body, torture everything that they have.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And the another side is on the right-hand side, where they move

82
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:27,166
to torture others, to destroy others, to overpower others.

83
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:33,375
Both ways we are away from God, and His mercy, and His grace.

84
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:39,625
The concern should be throughout towards the Spirit,

85
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:46,333
then the movement is in the right direction.

86
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:52,208
But this concern breaks up very easily in human beings

87
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:54,458
because they are free to do it.

88
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:59,999
In their ego they just break it; the connection, they break it.

89
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:08,375
So much so that when you develop artificial ways of enjoying life,

90
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,625
then even the consciousness of God is lost —

91
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,291
that He exists, that He has created us,

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
that He is the One

93
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,208
who is running the show.

94
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,709
We become so conscious of ourselves

95
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:35,083
that we think there’s nothing wrong.

96
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:40,625
We do this, we do that, plunge into all kinds of problems;

97
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:44,542
and we don’t understand that what we are doing

98
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,959
is against ourselves, and “ourselves” means against God,

99
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,625
because God has created us, He loves us.

100
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,834
We don’t love ourselves.

101
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:59,750
If we had loved ourselves, we would not have ruined our own body,

102
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:02,834
our own systems, everything that we have,

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,625
by saying, “What’s wrong? Why not do it?”

104
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:10,041
You must love this body of yours,

105
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,333
this mind of yours,

106
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,458
your society.

107
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,750
Everything you have to love because God has created you in His love.

108
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:26,583
But the love itself has become such a perverted word now.

109
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:31,250
“What is wrong in promiscuousness? It is love.”

110
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:37,667
If I tell that “No, it is not, because it is against nature.

111
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:42,999
It gives you trouble; you will be in a mess.

112
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,542
Listen to Me, it’s not proper,”

113
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,458
then people think that “This Lady is very matronly,

114
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,875
She is very old-fashioned, Victorian.”

115
00:08:55,041 --> 00:09:00,999
But it’s a fact. Why do things which will destroy you?

116
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,375
You can’t create yourself; you can’t even create

117
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,542
a nose for yourself, leave alone the whole body.

118
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,583
Then why should we be anti ourselves, first of all?

119
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:17,083
Then why should we be anti the society that we have created,

120
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,959
then against the whole nation that we have created,

121
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,999
and nations, and nations, and nations?

122
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,166
What are they doing, these all these politicians today?

123
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,583
Fighting for what? I just look at them, I can’t understand

124
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,792
what’s the matter with these people?

125
00:09:31,999 --> 00:09:35,417
Fighting to create more destructive forces,

126
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:40,542
more horrible things to destroy innocent human beings?

127
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:44,625
Those who are innocent are simply worried.

128
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,667
They don’t know what to do.

129
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:53,709
They don’t understand why they are to be dead tomorrow

130
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,792
because some people have gone off their heads.

131
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,417
And those who have gone off their heads are sitting

132
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,792
at the helm of affairs,

133
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,125
and we select them and elect them,

134
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:08,041
all such people who are sitting at the helm of affairs.

135
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,333
That’s how the negativity grows within us;

136
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:15,583
we become negative.

137
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:20,125
Both things are negative attitude because they negate God.

138
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,125
Negation of God is the first crime we have created.

139
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:28,999
We are not afraid of that God, awe for Him.

140
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:32,709
He is Compassion. He is Mercy. He is everything.

141
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:36,875
But in His mercy only He’s going to destroy the world.

142
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,542
He won’t allow you to commit more sins against Him.

143
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:48,999
He destroys - even - otherwise from within.

144
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,625
What is cancer?

145
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,250
What are all these diseases that are coming in our body?

146
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,000
They are nothing but our own destruction forces

147
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,166
that we ourselves have built within ourselves,

148
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,250
are breaking through.

149
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,625
There is no fear from outside invasion,

150
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,500
or from any star, or from any

151
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:17,625
extraterrestrial attack.

152
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:22,500
No, there is not. It is within us.

153
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,375
The attack is built within us, of which we should be aware.

154
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:32,041
In the name of freedom we have collected within ourselves

155
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,041
all the germs of our destruction.

156
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:41,125
It is such a built-in

157
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,458
process within us that we are not even aware

158
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:51,458
that they are growing, that they are there.

159
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:56,875
We are quite satisfied with ourselves, with our artificial life,

160
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,709
with our so-called

161
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:04,458
etiquettes and superficial mannerism.

162
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,917
Innately within us

163
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,458
there resides the Spirit

164
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:15,583
which wants to enlighten you,

165
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,792
which is anxious to enlighten you,

166
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:22,041
to give you the peace, the bliss, the joy of your being.

167
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,000
This beautiful lamp of yours which is being created,

168
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,792
is with a great purpose.

169
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,250
It has to be enlightened. Respect yourself!

170
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,208
There is no “respect” word left in the dictionary today.

171
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,083
Respect yourself!

172
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,583
We have to respect this lamp,

173
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:51,583
which has the light of the Spirit, that it should be enlightened;

174
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:56,125
and let us be that lamp, that shows the path

175
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,625
of glorification of your being.

176
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:04,834
And in that light we can see God’s Glory too.

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,542
It’s such a beautiful world He has created for us.

178
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,917
Everything He has given us,

179
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,875
but we in our ignorance and in so-called freedom

180
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:23,583
have ruined so many things.

181
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,417
It is sometimes shocking to see how people are going

182
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,999
just towards hell directly.

183
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:34,792
For a Mother it is a thing of great concern:

184
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:40,375
How to stop this pull? How to get them out of it?

185
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,792
how to make them understand what is your worth, what is your value?

186
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,917
You don’t take human life for granted.

187
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,333
It is a very precious life

188
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:58,667
created out of many processes.

189
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,125
With great difficulty it was created.

190
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,333
Don’t forget that you have to become the Spirit.

191
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,500
Without that, your life is just a waste,

192
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,709
the whole creation is a waste.

193
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,041
Because you are the highest in the creation!

194
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,834
You are the epitome of the creation, and what are you up to?

195
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,709
We have to form nucleuses

196
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:29,333
who will talk about Spirit now openly, about God.

197
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:32,875
I was amazed to hear that in this country

198
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,166
people don’t like to talk about God.

199
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,417
You cannot talk about God.

200
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,917
As soon as you say “God” — “Oh nothing! God?

201
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:43,125
That’s religion. That’s nothing to do with me.”

202
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,875
Can you imagine such a state of affair

203
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,250
where you cannot talk about your Creator?

204
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:54,333
Either you form some sort of a closed, secretive organization

205
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,875
where everybody can not enter into,

206
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:01,041
and say, “Now, we belong to certain cult of God.”

207
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,250
How can God have cults?

208
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,583
Just think of it. How can He have separate churches,

209
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:14,834
and separate temples and mosques? How can He have?

210
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:19,375
How can we become fanatic in the name of God? Can you imagine?

211
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:23,500
This is what we have done to God! We have become fanatic.

212
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,166
There’s a stone;

213
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,417
that stone, when it touches anything, it becomes gold.

214
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,333
But there must be a stone, when it touches human beings,

215
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:36,625
they become like prisons.

216
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,333
That’s why there is so much fanaticism.

217
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:43,458
It’s a problem today.

218
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,333
How to break this news and message

219
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:51,999
that you are the Spirit and you have to become the Spirit?

220
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,750
There is a Marathi poet called Namdev.

221
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,125
Because my mother tongue is Marathi,

222
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:02,875
and thank God I have been born in Maharashtra -

223
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,417
because it’s a country of saints,

224
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,166
thousands of saints lived in that country.

225
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,917
It’s the tradition, is so spiritual!

226
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,208
Spirituality is the tradition of that place

227
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,750
where I was born in that Maharashtra, called -

228
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,166
“maha” means the great and “rashtra” means the nation.

229
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,417
I don’t know why they thought of it, but I feel that way

230
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,500
that the tradition is of spirituality,

231
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:31,083
not of alcoholism, or drugism,

232
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,875
or call any other “isms” as they are.

233
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,667
But of spirituality is the tradition in that country

234
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:43,667
where a very simple poet called Namdev - he was a tailor,

235
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,291
himself was just a tailor, ordinary,

236
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,999
and he said, has written a very sweet poem,

237
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,000
which I will just tell you the explain what he says.

238
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:57,250
He says that a little boy

239
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:02,959
is flying a kite in the sky.

240
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,500
He’s looking at the sky, he’s talking to his friends,

241
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,834
he’s moving upward and downward,

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,542
and he’s discussing things here and there -

243
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,917
but his attention is on the kite.

244
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:21,083
Then he says a lady who is carrying her little baby

245
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,041
is doing the work in the house; she’s giving water to her husband;

246
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,542
and she is also sitting down and cooking,

247
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,083
and then she’s getting up to wash something;

248
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:39,291
the child is on her waist, resting -

249
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:44,542
but her attention is all the time on the child.

250
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,333
There’s a lady who is walking with a pitcher of water on her head.

251
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,000
She’s walking with many other ladies;

252
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,959
they are all walking together laughing, smiling,

253
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,208
young ladies talking to each other

254
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,709
and discussing things -

255
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,625
but their attention is on their Spirit,

256
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:12,250
in the sense it is on that pitcher of water.

257
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:17,041
In the same way, we, though we have to lead a life here,

258
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,667
of other things,

259
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:24,208
it is absurd that we do not have our attention on our Spirit,

260
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:29,166
which is the giver of joy - the ultimate in life.

261
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,999
But as soon as you start talking about something like that,

262
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,250
people think that it is something trash,

263
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,583
not to be listened to. Most surprising!

264
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:44,125
They want to hear the same mundane things again and again.

265
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,834
You see, if it is a broadcast by, say, Conservative Party,

266
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,417
or Labor Party, or another party, or any other party,

267
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:53,583
they’ll listen to it for hours together.

268
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,250
It’s such a mundane stuff, every year you hear that.

269
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:02,041
But if somebody says that “No, this is all artificial.

270
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:08,542
You have something much more within you, rise to that point,”

271
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,333
they think it is something… “We have not come to hear

272
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:14,999
all these things, what is this Mother telling us?”

273
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:19,125
But now awaken and arise!

274
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,166
On a different level we have to come to, to understand

275
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,375
that what these people have done so far - and we have accepted it,

276
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,291
we have taken it for granted all these years -

277
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,999
has done no good to us.

278
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:38,333
We have to rise above this to see: there is, beyond the horizon,

279
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:43,041
a star shining within us, and that is our Spirit.

280
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,250
People have talked about it, made another cult.

281
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,041
Talk about God, made another cult.

282
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,000
This time I saw one thing in the BBC,

283
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,834
they showed a cult which says, “We are doing God’s work.”

284
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,166
Doing God’s work? And the ladies

285
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,125
are tying up their thighs with thorns and things,

286
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,917
and hurting themselves, cutting their flesh.

287
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,667
And the explanation is - just imagine, in the name of God

288
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,500
doing such horrible stuff -

289
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,959
and the explanation is that “You must

290
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,750
have mortification.”

291
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,417
Why? Why should you have?

292
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,125
“Because Christ did it.” Are you Christ?

293
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,291
And that means Christ, whatever He did is waste.

294
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,667
Little bit of yours was needed to add.

295
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,709
Whatever He is done is more than sufficient

296
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:40,500
because He was the Prince.

297
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:44,917
And if a prince has to go through the mortification,

298
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:48,083
it’s a very great thing.

299
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:54,250
Not for a beggar to go through the mortification, what is so great?

300
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,417
He’s already done it.

301
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,709
He has worked for us.

302
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:05,125
He’s just to be enlightened within us,

303
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,208
and that’s how we have to get to our realization.

304
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,792
Now to sit down and to question

305
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:20,999
is very easy.

306
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,000
That’s the easiest thing to do, is to sit down and ask questions.

307
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,417
But best is to get to it,

308
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,875
to get your realization.

309
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,000
That is the most important thing today.

310
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,709
Of course, under the circumstances,

311
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:45,417
as the human beings are, it is not going to work very fast.

312
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:50,291
I’m sure of it. I have tried My level best.

313
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,917
Like mountains you have to raise the Kundalini,

314
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:57,917
really like mountains; you feel so tired and fagged out.

315
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,542
But then they don’t want to appreciate it,

316
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,875
so, not to feel disappointed,

317
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,542
not to feel hurt about it.

318
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,750
Slowly and steadily, I am sure,

319
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:17,083
in your own eyes people will see the light.

320
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,458
People will see how your life is transformed

321
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,750
into joy and bliss and understanding.

322
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:29,500
They will see how loving and dignified you have become,

323
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,917
and then they are going to believe

324
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,875
that there is a better life for you.

325
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,333
The state is so bad for some people;

326
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:45,458
they see, as I told you, a black picture of the whole thing.

327
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:50,458
They are so disappointed that they have given up.

328
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,000
They have just given up, they said, “Now we’ve finished with this.

329
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,125
We’ve done everything now. We don’t want to do any more.”

330
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:01,083
I’ve seen in France many people are sitting outside and discussing

331
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:04,959
that “When are we going to have now the ten stars

332
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:08,375
meeting together to collapse this world, once for all.”

333
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:10,583
They are discussing

334
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:13,959
that “Let us be finished soon now. We have had enough of it.

335
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,917
Let’s have the ultimate destruction, whether it was atom bomb

336
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,208
or anything, let us be finished, had enough of it.”

337
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,583
It is so desperate.

338
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:27,250
I can understand their desperation, those who are thinking about it,

339
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:31,208
those who are concerned about it and bothered about it,

340
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,999
no doubt one would feel desperate.

341
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,500
Even the Sahaja Yogis sometimes get very upset

342
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:41,500
and get extremely desperate and they say, “Give up, Mother.

343
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:45,291
Just we’ve finished with it. Now no more!”

344
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,291
But I don’t know how to remove My attention

345
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,208
from the Spirit.

346
00:23:53,417 --> 00:23:56,291
If you can try, you try your level best to remove it,

347
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,458
you cannot. Now you are there.

348
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:02,417
So, whatever it is, till the last breath of your life

349
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:07,250
you will fight to save as many as possible.

350
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:11,999
So, all those sahaja yogis who got very frustrated

351
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:17,208
in certain endeavors, I have to say — you should not be frustrated.

352
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,792
You have to keep your courage

353
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:24,917
and understanding that if you have feeling for others,

354
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:29,083
and if you really show your concern to them,

355
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:32,291
they will understand you and will be able

356
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:36,542
to get more and more people saved, emancipated,

357
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:41,917
and they will enter into the Kingdom of God.

358
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:46,333
As you are enjoying, they will also enjoy.

359
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:49,458
Only snag in the enjoyment is that you feel

360
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:53,625
that so many are still lost. Doesn’t matter.

361
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:57,709
That has to be made up. We have to work hard.

362
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:01,083
We have to understand that there are negative forces

363
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,041
which are pulling them down.

364
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,041
They are ignorant; they do not know beyond this life

365
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:13,250
resides the eternal life of beauty and glory.

366
00:25:13,709 --> 00:25:16,625
But gradually, I am sure, it will work out.

367
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:19,583
Specially for this meeting,

368
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:22,375
they had lots of ups and downs,

369
00:25:22,583 --> 00:25:27,166
and whole thing was very discouraging.

370
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:31,625
But still — one must understand

371
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,625
that God’s work is blessed by God.

372
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:38,625
He will render all His help,

373
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:43,625
all His blessings on you,

374
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:49,750
to enrich you, to enable you to perform your divine duties.

375
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:57,500
The time

376
00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:00,125
is passing.

377
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:03,333
Very little time left;

378
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,583
it’s running out,

379
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:10,500
and that’s why the desperation is more in people.

380
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,500
This desperation itself has brought forth

381
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:21,291
the advent of Sahaja Yoga on this earth,

382
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:28,125
and you should feel more

383
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:33,000
stronger to fight

384
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:37,999
these obstructions that you feel around,

385
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,166
and should work out

386
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,583
the ultimate goal of this creation.

387
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,792
May God bless you!

388
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:55,875
I would request

389
00:26:56,917 --> 00:27:02,250
people to be seated now

390
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,208
for a while

391
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:11,417
because we should try to get our Realization now.

392
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:19,041
One should have little time for oneself.

393
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:27,000
There is no limit of time in Sahaja Yoga.

394
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:30,999
Whenever the Kundalini has to rise, She rises.

395
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:35,166
May be today, may be tomorrow, may be day after.

396
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:39,375
Whenever you have to get your realization, it works out.

397
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:43,083
Only thing is we can expedite it,

398
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:49,000
we can work harder to cleanse the path to achieve it.

399
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:54,250
But we must make a start now, and once it works out,

400
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:58,625
then it is easy to handle it and to go further.

401
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:04,083
I’m sure John must have told you about the Kundalini.

402
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,583
Moreover, you can take the books from here.

403
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:10,208
There are little books published for the first people

404
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,750
who are coming to Sahaja Yoga.

405
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:16,875
It looks very complicated - it is not.

406
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:20,583
Like the switch here,

407
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:26,792
which can put all the lights to their enlightenment,

408
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
in the same way there’s a switch within you

409
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,875
which is called as the Kundalini.

410
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:35,417
And all this machinery is not to be bothered about.

411
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:38,959
Once you get your realization, the whole thing becomes very easy,

412
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,125
and you can get to it.

413
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,625
Of course, you know you can’t pay for it.

414
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:47,625
It’s very low-level business to pay for it.

415
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:51,792
People don’t understand that how can you pay for God’s love!

416
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,000
They can’t understand, this is beyond their mind,

417
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,999
because whatever they have got today - even the air -

418
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,917
they have to pay for it.

419
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,709
And you cannot put in any effort,

420
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:11,333
or you cannot put in any pain

421
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:16,458
or any troublesome things for yourself.

422
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:20,041
Moreover, there is complete freedom for you.

423
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,166
We cannot bind you by writing down

424
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:25,875
a sort of your name in the ledger,

425
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,750
and then making you a member and giving you a member card.

426
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,333
There is nothing like that in Sahaja Yoga is possible.

427
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,583
You can see it very clear, it is not possible -

428
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:40,375
if you understand on what level I’m talking.

429
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:45,083
You are absolutely free to get your realization,

430
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:49,375
absolutely free to move further with it;

431
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,875
and even, at that moment, if you want to leave,

432
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,959
you are absolutely free to leave.

433
00:29:56,125 --> 00:30:02,083
There’s nobody who is going to ask you to come back.

434
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:07,000
It is your own desire, it is your own wish

435
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,959
and it is your free will

436
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,417
that is going to be respected.

437
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:18,333
So nobody should think that we have a membership like a cult has,

438
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:22,208
or there is any fear that “If we get out of Sahaja Yoga,

439
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:26,834
then these people will catch hold of our necks and bring it back.”

440
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:31,000
So, it is not so.

441
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:36,959
It is a welcoming place and also it has an exit door.

442
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,291
Some people just get through one door and get out,

443
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,625
like a shuttle. No problem. It’s all right for us.

444
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:48,750
On the contrary, one feels relieved with such people

445
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:53,375
because if they cannot stick on, they cannot get to Sahaja Yoga.

446
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,959
Like any tree,

447
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:59,917
supposing if you embed it in the ground

448
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:04,250
and start shifting from there, what will you do with such a tree?

449
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:07,208
It cannot exist, it cannot grow.

450
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:11,709
So it is your own understanding that you have to take to,

451
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,250
your own wisdom.

452
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,083
We cannot force Sahaja Yoga on anyone,

453
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,208
and neither we want to;

454
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:24,000
nor Sahaja Yoga is going to fall at your feet

455
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:28,041
and give you false ideas.

456
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:32,083
Whatever it is, you see for yourself

457
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:36,291
and receive the blessings of your Spirit;

458
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,959
grow in it, understand it fully

459
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,917
and enjoy it.

460
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:48,875
This kind of state never existed in human life before.

461
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:52,458
It’s a very new world I’m talking about.

462
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:56,375
Wherever you go, you have to pay,

463
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,709
and then God knows whether you enjoy it or not.

464
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:04,333
But here it is within you, it’s all within you, it’s there.

465
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:08,041
Only thing is that you have to know yourself.

466
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,583
Now, in a ego-oriented personality

467
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,083
there can be a question why Mother should do it.

468
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,166
It’s a thankless job, I tell you.

469
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,291
If you can do it, I’ll be very thankful to you.

470
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,458
It’s really a thankless job in the sense that you feel so hurt

471
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:32,750
when you work so hard on a person, give him realization,

472
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:38,709
raise the Kundalini, really work very, very hard-

473
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,625
and then the person just turns out to be a criminal somewhere.

474
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:44,375
You just don’t know what to say.

475
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,917
It’s like a mother who gives birth to a child,

476
00:32:47,083 --> 00:32:49,291
looks after the child and makes it grow,

477
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,500
and then he ends up like a criminal. It’s very, very saddening,

478
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,333
but doesn’t matter.

479
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:02,709
Now, I started My Sahaja Yoga, as you know, with six people.

480
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:07,625
For four years I was laboring with six people in England,

481
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:10,792
in London - you can imagine.

482
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:15,291
Then we got the seventh one, and then the eighth one.

483
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,041
Then two ran away, so only six were left, you see.

484
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:25,125
It was like the mathematical questions you get where you say,

485
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,875
“A person came to work and he ran away second day;

486
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,875
then another came, ran away after third day.” Same thing!

487
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,583
I used to wonder, how can there be work

488
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:36,792
and how can the work be finished, with these runaways?

489
00:33:36,999 --> 00:33:39,834
In Sahaja Yoga also we have such problems,

490
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,709
but also you should know that there are people who have felt it,

491
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:48,166
their own glory,

492
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,959
and they have risen up to it and come up.

493
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:56,834
From England I have great hopes, very great hopes.

494
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,083
As I said that England is the heart of the universe,

495
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,875
it is the heart of the universe.

496
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:07,041
Specially Hampstead is what we call the jiggery,

497
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,542
is that muscle of the heart

498
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,083
which thrills, which thrills the heart, you see.

499
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,959
Hampstead is even much more important.

500
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,208
Which gives the thrills, you see.

501
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:25,500
And so, I expect

502
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:30,625
that we will have

503
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:36,333
people of great poetic qualities

504
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:40,375
and of great sanctity in this Hampstead;

505
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:43,208
and where a day will come

506
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:47,959
that will see the glory

507
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:52,166
of God’s Love

508
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,417
and His Kingdom

509
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:58,709
born in this Hampstead.

510
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:01,750
To the people who do not know about England -

511
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:06,458
the deeper side of it - it’s just another country in Europe.

512
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:10,542
To Me, it is not. To Me it is very important.

513
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,667
And that’s why I’ve been working here for ten years!

514
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,667
This is the tenth year I’m working,

515
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:19,333
and I hope to do more for two years.

516
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:22,917
While in India, I worked hardly for two years,

517
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:27,792
but there are thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis,

518
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:31,750
while here we have about thousand in London.

519
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:35,625
That’s a good number to start with.

520
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:41,208
So, if you have any questions you may ask Me,

521
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:44,291
and then we’ll have the session of Realization.

522
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,917
But I have to make one humble request that you should not,

523
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:51,125
at the time of meditation, leave the place

524
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,125
and behave in a very absurd manner.

525
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:56,667
That’s not proper. You must respect.

526
00:35:56,875 --> 00:36:02,875
You must respect others who are trying to get their realization.

527
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,750
So it’s better you leave earlier, otherwise you be civil to them

528
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,208
and get your realization also.

529
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,917
It may work out today, quite possible.

530
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:18,750
As I have seen the other day in Brighton,

531
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,125
they all got it in one shot.

532
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:25,291
Why not in Hampstead, which, I think, is a very great place,

533
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,999
is a very subtle, special place in the heart of the universe.

534
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:34,125
So it should work out here. May God bless you!

535
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:39,500
Now ask Me questions if you have any, without any fear;

536
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:42,792
but not irrelevant, stupid questions, you understand that.

537
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:46,041
It’s not good. I would not like to waste time

538
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,291
of people who have come to seek the truth.

539
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,999
So please ask Me questions if you have any,

540
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:58,125
or we will go in for the Realization.

541
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:22,166
No questions? Wonderful people!

542
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:29,583
No questions at all?

543
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,667
Yes, yes please.

544
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,959
It’s not really a question, it’s just that

545
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,166
I find it hard to hear what You are saying.

546
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:39,041
Is there a way of adjusting the microphone or something?

547
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,625
What is it? Can you come and tell Me somehow?

548
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,417
He said he can’t hear at the back,

549
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,542
but unfortunately the microphone is at maximum.

550
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,625
You can’t hear?

551
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,917
No, it seems to distort.

552
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:57,291
This not all right? What did he say? I didn’t follow.

553
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,750
Couldn’t quite hear the words.

554
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:02,166
You couldn’t get any words to yourself,

555
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:06,291
did you say that? Same with Me, I can’t hear you.

556
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,542
It’s mutual, but doesn’t matter.

557
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,583
You see, even if you have not heard Me,

558
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,875
makes no difference, nothing.

559
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:16,875
Love has no language,

560
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:20,583
and this Divine Power has no language, all right?

561
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,999
Did you understand that much?

562
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:26,166
Did you follow Me, even that?

563
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:32,041
I am saying that love does not require any language.

564
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,959
It is an all-pervading power, which is everywhere

565
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:43,041
and whatever may be the language, it makes no difference.

566
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,667
It is a silent language which will work it out.

567
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,875
I was surprised, some of the sahaja yogis who went to India

568
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,000
were very silently meditating

569
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,208
when I was speaking in Marathi or Hindi.

570
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:59,834
And I was amazed how they were so attentive.

571
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,083
They said, “Thank God, we did not understand, Mother,

572
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:06,625
what You were saying, so we were not putting our mind into it

573
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:09,792
and were just enjoying the vibrations.”

574
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:14,125
Isn’t it surprising that they would sit for an hour or so

575
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:18,375
just listening to Me in some foreign language?

576
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:21,667
All right, doesn’t matter, right?

577
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:27,125
What’s wrong with your thing, you see? Acoustics are wrong?

578
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,417
What’s wrong? They can’t hear Me.

579
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,875
The microphone is as loud as it can be. And I think

580
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,750
there is probably a problem with the loudspeakers themselves.

581
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:43,417
Unfortunately, we’re not able to get to the controls.

582
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:46,458
We can’t get to the controls, Mother, like we can at Caxton Hall.

583
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,834
All right?

584
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:55,000
Sorry for this some sort of a mechanical problem.

585
00:39:55,208 --> 00:40:00,458
But doesn’t matter, the mechanics in you are perfect.

586
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,291
I don’t know a word about this electricity business

587
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
that you people have created, not a word! I don’t know how it works,

588
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:12,875
but as far as your Kundalini is concerned, I’ll work it out.

589
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:16,166
There’s no problem on that.

590
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,583
All right.

591
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:27,333
These acoustics, I think, of this town hall may be wrong.

592
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,875
All right.

593
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,250
Now what should I do if they can’t hear Me?

594
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:38,458
Can you hear Me now?

595
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:42,291
The gentleman? All right.

596
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,750
I think, Mataji, one of the things is just that You have

597
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:50,291
a soft voice, and at the end of the sentence Your voice disappears.

598
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,750
With this?

599
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,583
(...) at the end of each sentence You say

600
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,792
there’s a fade because Your voice is soft.

601
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:59,125
Softens down? My voice soften…

602
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,500
Even when You make the points,

603
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,500
the voice goes very soft, and we don’t hear the last words

604
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,291
of a sentence.

605
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,583
What about sahaja yogis, you heard Me fully?

606
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,583
Yes.

607
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:15,250
There’s a little difference.

608
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:19,083
I’ll tell you. I must confess to you very humbly

609
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:22,542
that when a non-sahaja yogi speaks to Me,

610
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,999
I find it difficult to understand,

611
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,250
but if a sahaja yogi speaks to Me, is easier.

612
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:32,166
I must confess it’s a little deficiency with Me, is that -

613
00:41:32,417 --> 00:41:35,291
That’s why if anybody asks Me question, even in the first row,

614
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,709
I’ll ask some sahaja yogi to tell Me what’s there,

615
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:43,500
because My ears are, I think, little bit not so all right.

616
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,375
So it is with you people also may be

617
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,208
that, once you get your Realization - now, the sahaja yogis

618
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:52,041
are sitting at the back, and they can hear Me every word.

619
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,500
So there’s something wrong with this voice of Mine

620
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:58,458
because it doesn’t adjust to your ears,

621
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:01,125
for the frequencies, I think, doesn’t matter.

622
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,166
It will work out. All right? So…

623
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:07,083
The only thing, it is difficult to understand if we don’t hear.

624
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:08,999
Don’t hear?

625
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,500
Why are You saying it’s not important to understand?

626
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,792
No, it is important to understand —

627
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,250
but not to think about it. Forget it.

628
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,166
Forget it, don’t think too much.

629
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,500
Whatever you don’t have to understand, you better not understand

630
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,667
because sometimes, you know, talking becomes a barrier,

631
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:33,625
and listening is another barrier, and then thinking is the worst.

632
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:39,125
All right? So let us see how it works out, all right?

633
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:43,458
Let us see how it works out within.

634
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:53,166
You will gradually understand what purpose My speech serves,

635
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:57,792
gradually, all right? I have to speak with a purpose,

636
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,750
but what is the purpose,

637
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:02,375
that you will understand little later if you don’t mind.

638
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,834
But just now you must understand the purpose of your life,

639
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:09,208
that is your Spirit — and get to it.

640
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:12,041
Now is it clear what I said?

641
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,792
That sentence, yes.

642
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:16,375
Yes, all right. Thank you.

643
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:24,083
All right, let us put our hands towards

644
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:28,999
Me, and Me towards you.

645
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:36,542
Now - I think, you see, this also slips out.

646
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,375
You see, I’m very bad at electrical things.

647
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:45,041
I never know even how to open My radio, I’m so hopelessly bad.

648
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,083
So, if I’m making mistakes, you should not mind,

649
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:52,333
because I’m not so mechanical, you know, I don’t understand.

650
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:59,458
So, what you have to do is to be relaxed in the sense

651
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:03,875
that don’t put any strain on your neck or on your body

652
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:08,542
but sit straight, and no strain on the neck at all.

653
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,709
Neck, we have strained too much, so leave it in the center.

654
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:15,792
Not too much at the back, not too much in front,

655
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:21,667
but keep it in the center, because this neck has a problem.

656
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,959
All right?

657
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,917
Now, you have to stretch you hands

658
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:31,375
straight like this towards Me

659
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:39,250
and close your eyes. That’s all.

660
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:43,417
You have to take out your spectacles if possible,

661
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,875
because it helps also your eyes,

662
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,333
and

663
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:55,166
take out your shoes, if possible.

664
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,834
One should not have anything tight on the waist or in the neck,

665
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,583
little bit loosen. If it is not uncomfortable, that’s all right.

666
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:08,125
If it is comfortable, then it’s all right.

667
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,999
First thing is, you should be comfortable and not disturbed.

668
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,875
That is the main thing.

669
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:18,875
And not to have any fears, nor any guilt.

670
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:23,583
That is very important not to have any guilt.

671
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:27,333
Whatever I have said, I’ve not said for you.

672
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:30,291
So you don’t have any guilt built in you.

673
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,999
Just say first and foremost thing,

674
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:38,291
after closing your eyes, that “Mother, I am not guilty.”

675
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,083
Say it thrice with full confidence.

676
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:44,333
I request you to say that.

677
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:49,999
Please say that “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please!

678
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,750
This is how you respect yourself.

679
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,458
You have no business to condemn yourself

680
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:58,959
because you are the temple of God.

681
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:05,500
Just say it in your heart,

682
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:11,083
but with full confidence, not doubting yourself at all;

683
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,834
for My sake, please don’t doubt yourself.

684
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,291
Just say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

685
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,000
And forget about what you have done or anything, forget the past.

686
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,333
I’m talking about the present at this moment.

687
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:28,417
So just please say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

688
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:32,750
Is a very important thing.

689
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:41,375
Now, keep your eyes shut, please don’t open them,

690
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:45,166
because, once the Kundalini starts rising,

691
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:47,999
you have to keep your eyes open,

692
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:52,250
and the attention will be attracted inside;

693
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:56,041
and after it reaches the Agnya Chakra,

694
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:01,166
then you will become thoughtlessly aware.

695
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:05,542
There won’t be any thoughts but you will be fully aware.

696
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:08,875
So please, don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

697
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:12,166
This is one thing you have to do, that’s all,

698
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:16,500
not to open your eyes till I tell you.

699
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:22,333
Now, the left hand should be towards Me,

700
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:25,291
throughout.

701
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:33,166
Left hand is symbolically indicative of your desire.

702
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:40,583
And the right hand is your action.

703
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:54,083
So we have to use the right hand to express our action.

704
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:58,208
The first thing, as I told you, not to feel guilty,

705
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,709
but I know you are all feeling still guilty

706
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,959
because I can feel on your chakras.

707
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,625
Now will you please again say it three times,

708
00:48:06,834 --> 00:48:08,959
otherwise you’ll be punished for thirty-two times

709
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,291
or sixty-four times.

710
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,875
That’s the only punishment you have to have, is to say,

711
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:20,291
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

712
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:29,000
Now, put the right hand on your heart,

713
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:32,208
heart.

714
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:39,542
Here resides the Spirit, in the heart.

715
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,625
So, with the left hand towards Me,

716
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:47,250
open towards Me,

717
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:50,583
you have to say,

718
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,875
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

719
00:48:54,041 --> 00:49:00,041
Ask the question: “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

720
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:21,542
Now you must know, when you are the Spirit,

721
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,792
you don’t need anybody to guide you

722
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:29,041
because you’ll be enlightened by your Spirit,

723
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,333
and the Spirit will guide you,

724
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:35,208
because after Realization you develop a new awareness

725
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:39,792
by which you are guided through your vibrations.

726
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,417
So you have to put your hand down

727
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,083
on the left-hand side of your stomach

728
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:50,041
where to say,

729
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:56,583
“Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide?

730
00:49:56,792 --> 00:50:00,166
Am I my own guru?”

731
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:07,625
Anyone of these questions you can ask ten times.

732
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:14,750
Establish your confidence first that you are the Spirit,

733
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:20,041
which is above, detached,

734
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:27,959
and is the source of joy,

735
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,417
complete source of joy.

736
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:37,250
With confidence you have to ask these questions.

737
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,917
I am here to answer them.

738
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:43,333
So please ask the question in your heart saying,

739
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:49,542
“Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

740
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:01,875
Put your hand on the left-hand side stomach.

741
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:05,959
Here is the center for the establishment

742
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:11,208
of your guru principle, your master principle.

743
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:14,917
You are the master, as I say, of your body,

744
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:17,458
of your mind, of your intellect.

745
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:21,959
You are not to play into them, but you become the master.

746
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:33,875
You don’t need any guru. You become your own guru.

747
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:39,166
It's better now.

748
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:44,500
Now, raise your hand again to your heart.

749
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,583
And now, with full confidence, you say,

750
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:53,542
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

751
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:57,041
This you have to say twelve times

752
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:03,750
because the center of the heart has got twelve petals.

753
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:07,291
You have to say it twelve times:

754
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,999
“Mother, I am the Spirit”, with full confidence

755
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,500
and respect of yourself - which you are.

756
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:23,792
You are the Spirit, no doubt, but just assert!

757
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,041
That is how we are clearing our centers.

758
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:46,792
Now, raise your right hand to your left side

759
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:51,458
at the base of your neck.

760
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:57,667
This is another center which gets caught up when we feel guilty.

761
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:04,667
Now, those who have said that “I am the Spirit,”

762
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:10,000
you must know that Spirit can never be guilty of anything.

763
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:14,542
It is a sinless,

764
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:17,834
beautiful,

765
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,834
brilliant diamond within you.

766
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,458
It cannot get contaminated by any guilt.

767
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:29,291
So you have to say now here eight times:

768
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,999
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

769
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:42,041
For those who have always felt guilty, can say sixteen times.

770
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:25,208
Now, raise this hand on top of your head

771
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,750
and put it at the fontanel bone area,

772
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:30,625
which was a soft part in your childhood,

773
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:35,291
and put your palm on top of it, on top of it, let it rest.

774
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,625
And now move the head in a clockwise manner,

775
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:40,333
pressing it down with your palm.

776
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:43,417
Just press it down and move it in a clockwise manner.

777
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:46,375
If you do it from the side, you’ll do it better.

778
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,542
Hold it from the side.

779
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:54,208
Put your hand sideways, not from front, you do it better.

780
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:57,417
And now turn it,

781
00:54:57,875 --> 00:55:03,000
little bit pressing it down with your palm.

782
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:09,041
Turn your hand, not your head.

783
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:17,834
At this point, again, your freedom is to be respected.

784
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,458
I cannot cross over it.

785
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:23,999
So you have to say that you want your Realization.

786
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:28,083
You can say, “Mother, I want my Realization.

787
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:31,625
Please, may I have the Realization?”

788
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:37,959
Please say it seven times, just pressing it.

789
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:43,458
You must touch your head. It’s all hot, you can see that,

790
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,458
the heat is coming out.

791
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:47,834
You must touch it and press it down,

792
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,750
and see such a lot of heat is coming out.

793
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:05,291
Now, seven times you have to say it.

794
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,709
After that, you can raise your hand

795
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:10,834
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

796
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,917
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost!

797
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,500
So you can ask a question,

798
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,667
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

799
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,208
Every one of you.

800
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,667
You can change your hands now. You can use the left hand.

801
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:25,875
Put the right hand towards Me.

802
00:56:26,709 --> 00:56:28,959
Keep your eyes shut and ask the question:

803
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:33,667
“Mother, is this the breeze?”

804
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:41,333
All of you should get it.

805
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:44,500
Possible! Change your hands again if you want to.

806
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:48,917
You go on changing and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

807
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:52,041
It has to be cool breeze. First the heat will come out,

808
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,458
so it’s a good sign that the heat is going out,

809
00:56:55,667 --> 00:57:00,083
all the heat with tension and all that is going out.

810
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:09,166
It’s working out. It’s very subtle.

811
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,000
We are moving from gross awareness

812
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,875
to a subtler awareness of the roots.

813
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:20,291
So naturally, one has to pay attention to it.

814
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,041
Little in front, it is not at the back of the head

815
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,667
but little bit in the front side.

816
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:32,999
Try one after another and pay attention to it.

817
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Very hot today!

818
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,542
Now, without opening the eyes, again put back hands towards Me

819
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:43,542
like this,

820
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,834
and see if there’s a cool breeze

821
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,125
coming to your fingertips, to begin with.

822
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:56,375
Just put both the hands and see if there’s a cool breeze.

823
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:02,500
Ask again the question:

824
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:07,834
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

825
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:14,917
Ask thrice. Means the Kundalini. Kundalini is the Holy Ghost.

826
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:19,208
How is the lady?

827
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:24,959
It’s all right. Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

828
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:30,166
She’ll be all right, don’t worry. Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

829
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:33,834
Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

830
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,875
She’ll be all right. Don’t worry, I’m looking after her.

831
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:40,041
She’s come.

832
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,917
She’ll be all right.

833
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Now, if you are getting cool breeze in the hand,

834
00:59:57,208 --> 00:59:59,917
you can also now see it if you raise your hands.

835
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:04,458
Open your eyes and raise your hands. Slowly open your eyes, slowly.

836
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:07,542
Raise your hands like this.

837
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:12,709
Like this, as much as you can stress, let’s see.

838
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:22,041
Are you feeling?

839
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:28,250
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

840
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,792
Are you feeling the cool breeze now?

841
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:39,875
Those who are feeling should say, “Yes.”

842
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:43,041
Yes.

843
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:46,875
All right. Now just put your hands like that

844
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:52,375
and see now if you are feeling the cool breeze.

845
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:57,875
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

846
01:00:58,041 --> 01:01:00,917
Just enjoy yourself. Close your eyes.

847
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:04,999
At this time, there are sahaja yogis here,

848
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:10,500
who will help you to completely establish the experience

849
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:16,166
and to see if there are any obstacles.

850
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:20,999
So sahaja yogis should do it very carefully, without talking,

851
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:25,291
and raise the Kundalini if necessary in some people.

852
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,291
Don’t talk to them, don’t touch them,

853
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,959
just start raising the Kundalini.

854
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:35,959
Slowly, try to do it.

855
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,250
Keep your eyes shut. We’ll work it out for you.

856
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:42,125
Now, those who have come for the first time

857
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:46,500
and have felt the cool breeze, raise your hands first of all.

858
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:48,999
First time who have come and felt the cool breeze,

859
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:52,291
raise your hands, higher.

860
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:57,999
Yah, good. It’s good.

861
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:01,083
So, please put down.

862
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:05,208
Did you see them? Can you work on them and see?

863
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:11,041
Now. And those who have not felt, please raise your hands.

864
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:16,041
At all. The cool breeze.

865
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:20,375
For the first time who have come and have not felt the cool breeze,

866
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:23,500
raise your hand.

867
01:02:23,709 --> 01:02:28,125
Markus? Who’s there? Has he felt the cool breeze there?

868
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:33,125
Helen, behind you the gentleman, who could not hear Me?

869
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,750
All right, then it’s all right, it’s done.

870
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:38,333
Now, just see the people who have not felt the cool breeze.

871
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:41,250
Please, raise your hands please.

872
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:47,166
This one gentleman, this lady, this gentleman…
