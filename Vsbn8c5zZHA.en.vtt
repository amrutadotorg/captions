WEBVTT

00:08:39.093 --> 00:08:41.673
Today is a special day, as you know

00:08:41.939 --> 00:08:46.100
we are worshipping the Goddess,

00:08:47.113 --> 00:08:52.520
who came on this earth nine times before,

00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:57.933
to kill all the demons and all the negativity

00:08:58.426 --> 00:09:03.926
and relieve all the bhaktas to worship.

00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:13.260
All her work has already been described.

00:09:14.593 --> 00:09:18.780
Despite that they find,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.220
new type of devils,

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:27.380
new type of negative people,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.379
have come back.

00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:36.820
Perhaps it had to be.

00:09:50.318 --> 00:09:55.180
This had to be maybe, after all it is Kali Yuga

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:59.140
and the drama of Kali Yuga would not be

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:03.660
performed unless and until they are there.

00:10:07.285 --> 00:10:11.220
So, to complete this drama, they came.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.300
But this time

00:10:16.446 --> 00:10:22.380
is going to be a very different type of

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:26.479
war.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.580
It's going to be the war of the peaceful people

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:37.420
and the peaceful people

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:43.380
are the most successful people

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:48.153
in every walk of life, even in a war.

00:10:50.007 --> 00:10:52.906
It did not work out before.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.100
They say that when Genghis Khan came,

00:10:59.753 --> 00:11:04.820
he went to a very big monastery of Buddhist,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.380
near Gaya, and killed all of them,

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:14.380
there were about 30,000 of Buddhists there,

00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:18.100
and they didn't say a
word and they were all killed.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.420
So people started disbelieving in Buddhism.

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:30.660
They said, ''What kind of a Buddhism
is here, why didn't Buddha save them?''.

00:11:32.473 --> 00:11:36.687
That's human style of thinking.

00:11:37.033 --> 00:11:42.140
''Buddha should have saved these
30,000 people who were peaceful,

00:11:43.413 --> 00:11:45.706
who were resisting,

00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:50.940
in a manner that was no resistance,

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:56.500
and so they were all killed by this
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan''.

00:11:57.893 --> 00:12:00.980
But you will be surprised, in this Kali Yuga,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:08.060
this Genghis Khan has been praised by many
authors, and there are books written about him.

00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:13.340
He was not a Muslim, but some sort of a crackpot.

00:12:14.346 --> 00:12:19.060
He finished off many mosques,

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.540
he destroyed many beautiful buildings

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:32.780
and also he came to India and ruled
there for a short time.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.466
All that's a history.

00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:39.980
In the same way,

00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:46.500
there have been wars

00:12:51.693 --> 00:12:56.700
between Christians and Non-Christians,

00:12:58.313 --> 00:13:01.460
between Muslim and Non-Muslims.

00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:08.740
All kinds of wars we have heard of where

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.740
only the faithful got lost

00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:19.100
the real people got lost, the one who worshipped

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:24.540
God with full faith, got lost.

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:30.580
So many people became atheists

00:13:31.286 --> 00:13:36.580
and they said, ''There is nothing
like God, nothing like his Divine power,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.546
it never existed, we were stupid,
we were foolish, to follow all this''.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.340
And those who were in charge of religion

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.246
took full advantage of that and said

00:13:50.447 --> 00:13:54.980
that these people were sinful people,

00:13:55.826 --> 00:14:00.420
these people were not Godly people

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:06.580
and that's how they were
killed by us and we were victorious.

00:14:09.166 --> 00:14:14.460
The idea of victory they had,
that they have been successful

00:14:14.953 --> 00:14:18.893
and so many people
have been butchered by us.

00:14:23.273 --> 00:14:25.940
So we come to Kali Yuga,

00:14:28.233 --> 00:14:30.646
and in Kali Yuga

00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:35.400
the same thing has started, in a subtler way,

00:14:35.633 --> 00:14:40.260
in a different way,
it has started that there's a big

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.045
war going on between the people

00:14:44.246 --> 00:14:48.920
who are anti-God

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:55.180
and who are using God for their own purpose.

00:14:55.993 --> 00:15:00.780
Very dishonest, very corrupt, very cruel people

00:15:01.353 --> 00:15:06.620
and they are using the flag of God,

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:12.420
that banner which they have no right to use.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.620
Then there are Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:18.926 --> 00:15:23.913
who have got their Realization
and they have to fight them.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.780
Now the difference

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.460
in the previous wars
and this war is very different.

00:15:37.713 --> 00:15:43.460
In those wars, you see all those
who were supposed to be victorious

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.353
- this was, after all, the nine battles

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.026
of the Divine Mother

00:15:58.106 --> 00:16:03.220
- the negativity that came
up and which became successful,

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:08.900
started feeling very confident that
we have achieved what we wanted.

00:16:13.293 --> 00:16:15.620
But in Kali Yuga,

00:16:16.326 --> 00:16:21.020
in the light of Kali Yuga,

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.580
all those historical victories

00:16:28.606 --> 00:16:32.060
are regarded as shameful things,

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:37.620
as something very aggressive and non-sensical.

00:16:40.886 --> 00:16:44.300
This is now being described everywhere.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.460
Like the white skinned people went to,

00:16:50.986 --> 00:16:54.940
America and killed all the rest of them there.

00:16:56.713 --> 00:17:01.580
Now, that is coming into light.

00:17:03.173 --> 00:17:06.300
All these people

00:17:06.986 --> 00:17:10.860
who thought themselves to be victorious

00:17:11.173 --> 00:17:14.900
- their children, their grandchildren,
their progeny - are ashamed of them,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.620
ashamed to call that
they were their forefathers,

00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:23.413
up till the last war.

00:17:26.453 --> 00:17:29.300
This awareness, which has come,

00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:36.260
is the real victory of modern times,

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:39.426
of this Kali Yuga.

00:17:40.113 --> 00:17:43.620
That everything that was accepted

00:17:44.226 --> 00:17:48.060
as a part of the game, as the

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.780
lifestyle, you can call it,

00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:58.380
is now being challenged
in modern times everywhere.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.845
Whatever is aggression,

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:05.860
whatever is oppression,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.113
whatever is cruel,

00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:14.660
is now punished also.

00:18:17.526 --> 00:18:22.140
You see so many war criminals might have escaped

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.293
but so many went into trials,

00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:31.413
it never happened before,
nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

00:18:32.613 --> 00:18:34.900
Now in a very subtle way,

00:18:35.533 --> 00:18:39.860
all these aggressive people are getting now afraid

00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:44.940
that they will be questioned

00:18:46.013 --> 00:18:49.860
and they maybe tortured.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.226
It started, I don't know where,
but definitely at the beginning of the Kali Yuga.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:03.140
If you remember, in this country
there was a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.020
and ultimately he was hanged.

00:19:08.726 --> 00:19:11.540
In Germany there was a very powerful man

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.560
called Hitler and Himler and all this.

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:17.220
God knows what happened to them,

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.706
even the Germans don't want to take his name,

00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.193
they are all ashamed of him.

00:19:24.326 --> 00:19:27.866
Then we had somebody, say in England,

00:19:28.093 --> 00:19:33.140
Warren Hastings, who came to India, he was put to
jail.

00:19:33.626 --> 00:19:35.860
This was never done before.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:40.900
If Napoleon aggressed people,

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:44.113
he thought he was very victorious,

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:47.740
but he could not continue with it,

00:19:48.393 --> 00:19:50.740
he had to face it.

00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:54.185
You see anybody,

00:19:54.386 --> 00:19:58.700
who has been aggressive,

00:19:58.986 --> 00:20:02.300
who has been dominating,

00:20:02.613 --> 00:20:08.380
who has been very cruel, demonic,

00:20:09.306 --> 00:20:13.620
has been taken to task, mostly in his lifetime.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:21.780
Now, if not in his lifetime,

00:20:22.466 --> 00:20:26.660
afterwards, he was maligned,

00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:30.513
and he doesn't have a
name like “a hero” or anything,

00:20:30.713 --> 00:20:33.926
people don't want to erect their statues.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.340
So the awareness has come
in the mind of the people.

00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:42.040
Like a person like Stalin,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.113
who ruled Russia once upon a time,

00:20:45.314 --> 00:20:49.592
today you can't see even one statue of Stalin,

00:20:49.793 --> 00:20:52.180
these are modern times.

00:20:53.946 --> 00:20:57.227
See the power of modern times!

00:20:57.766 --> 00:21:00.440
And that is frightening to those people

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.420
who think they can get along
with whatever they are doing.

00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:11.980
It is going to be very soon understood by them,

00:21:12.393 --> 00:21:15.620
that they have to stop all this nonsense,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.300
otherwise they will suffer.

00:21:20.066 --> 00:21:23.660
It's not those whom they are dominating

00:21:23.946 --> 00:21:27.333
but those who are dominating, who will suffer.

00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:31.007
They will suffer physically,
they will suffer mentally,

00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:34.220
they will suffer emotionally, and also

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.573
their fame will be in the mud.

00:21:40.306 --> 00:21:44.340
So today's victory of the

00:21:45.313 --> 00:21:49.300
power of the Divine Mother,

00:21:49.946 --> 00:21:54.740
is doing one very great work - is to expose,

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.540
and this exposure will be

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:05.820
condemning publicly those
people who are doing wrong.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.300
If you see from that point of view

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.853
you will understand how we are victorious now.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.586
Many of you felt very sad that I
didn't get the award [Peace Nobel Price].

00:22:22.787 --> 00:22:25.380
This award makes no difference to Me

00:22:25.733 --> 00:22:28.300
and to you also, I must tell you.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:32.820
Because you have come without I having any award,

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.940
and many will come without
having any award as such.

00:22:37.506 --> 00:22:41.480
But, this time, for the first time,

00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:46.780
if you notice, the people
who got the award are condemned.

00:22:47.613 --> 00:22:50.660
Even now they are writing against it,

00:22:50.926 --> 00:22:53.540
even now they are criticized.

00:22:54.193 --> 00:22:59.273
So those who have been, they
thought they were very smart,

00:22:59.473 --> 00:23:03.780
but the smartness is out now and
I don't know how long will it go on.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.820
Because even today, if you open a
newspaper, you will find something about it,

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.427
that how stupidly they have done it,

00:23:12.627 --> 00:23:16.140
they can't understand what
was the reason they have done it.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.580
Not only the people who selected are criticized,

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:24.286
but very much more the people who are selected.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.740
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis,

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:34.180
we have to know what is the difference between

00:23:34.453 --> 00:23:39.333
the consciousness at that
time and awareness at this time.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:50.133
That time it was necessary to kill those demons -
finish them, but they are back again on the stage.

00:23:55.493 --> 00:23:59.780
Now, at this time, when it is Kali Yuga,

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.900
they are exposed,

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.420
they are condemned, they are put in the jail

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.220
and they are now punished publicly.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.807
So the collective awareness

00:24:19.953 --> 00:24:23.873
has got such a great victory, I think,

00:24:24.073 --> 00:24:28.980
over these people whom so
many came, killed and died

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.580
without getting any punishment out of it,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.860
without getting any defamation out of it.

00:24:37.386 --> 00:24:40.140
Now let us see
what is consciousness

00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:42.706
and what is awareness.

00:24:55.773 --> 00:25:00.540
It is a subtle subject, which I think you all
can understand.

00:25:03.219 --> 00:25:05.700
Consciousness is that,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.020
when you are made conscious,
you become conscious about it.

00:25:10.526 --> 00:25:13.500
Like I have my hand here, alright,

00:25:14.566 --> 00:25:19.460
but normally I am not conscious of it,
that I have a hand.

00:25:22.866 --> 00:25:27.180
If a man is sleeping,
he's not conscious that he is sleeping.

00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:32.860
When you tell Me,
“You have a hand”. I become conscious,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.580
or something pricks Me, then I become conscious.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.260
Otherwise, I am unconscious about it.

00:25:44.133 --> 00:25:48.500
I'm absolutely unconscious about my eyes,

00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:51.260
I'm seeing everything.

00:25:51.793 --> 00:25:55.780
But supposing I become blind,

00:25:56.546 --> 00:26:01.180
I can't see, then I become conscious

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:07.780
of my eyes that I've got, my eyes
through which now I cannot see.

00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:13.940
So once you say there is this hand,

00:26:14.346 --> 00:26:16.420
the consciousness is there.

00:26:17.206 --> 00:26:20.860
This we can say, is the knowledge about the hand,

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.620
that you get knowledge about the hand.

00:26:25.633 --> 00:26:30.860
But once you are not conscious of the hand,

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.380
that knowledge has disappeared.

00:26:36.306 --> 00:26:40.940
So, to say there is
ignorance or there is knowledge,

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.380
both things are just the same.

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:50.260
You are not conscious of your hand,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.180
so you are quite ignorant about it.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:59.333
Now supposing somebody says,
“Your hands are very beautiful”.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.387
Somebody remarks like that,

00:27:03.587 --> 00:27:07.660
then I become conscious of
my hand, which is beautiful.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.953
Otherwise, I never knew they were beautiful.

00:27:14.378 --> 00:27:18.900
So, normally all human beings live at that level

00:27:20.026 --> 00:27:22.500
that somebody has to tell you.

00:27:22.893 --> 00:27:27.020
Now, somebody said
“you are wearing a very nice sari”, all right.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.700
Then I look at it, “yes,
it's very nice, I never knew”.

00:27:35.299 --> 00:27:39.860
So, somebody has to tell
you, then you become conscious,

00:27:41.219 --> 00:27:43.300
otherwise you are not.

00:27:46.506 --> 00:27:50.713
So, we all human beings,
at that level, are like that.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.460
Now, what is awareness?

00:27:57.353 --> 00:27:59.580
That's a different thing.

00:28:00.653 --> 00:28:04.707
That means, if I see

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.660
somebody is attacking me,

00:28:08.026 --> 00:28:10.460
I put my hand - like this,

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.780
that means I am aware that I have a hand

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.100
I'm not conscious but I am aware
that I have a hand, I have to use it.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.500
Like here in Italy you go on
using your hands all the time, like this.

00:28:26.313 --> 00:28:30.673
That means you know, you are
aware, that you have got hands,

00:28:30.873 --> 00:28:36.633
that you have to use them for expressing
something more, sort of emphatically.

00:28:39.593 --> 00:28:42.420
So we are sort of

00:28:42.699 --> 00:28:46.660
also aware of our body,

00:28:47.113 --> 00:28:49.580
we are aware of others,

00:28:51.706 --> 00:28:54.220
we know about others,

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:58.033
we know what sort of a person another one is

00:28:58.293 --> 00:29:01.900
up till you are Self-realized.

00:29:06.073 --> 00:29:09.020
After Self-realization, what happens?

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.540
It is very interesting.

00:29:13.379 --> 00:29:19.220
After Self-realization you
go beyond both these things.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.860
Consciousness and awareness.

00:29:25.366 --> 00:29:30.460
Because you go beyond thought.

00:29:32.773 --> 00:29:37.813
You have gone beyond thought, means what? - anger,

00:29:39.773 --> 00:29:44.487
all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

00:29:44.687 --> 00:29:49.500
everything is maneuvered

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:52.346
or worked through your mind.

00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:59.700
So if your mind is lost, what will you do?

00:30:02.246 --> 00:30:04.460
There's no mind anymore.

00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:08.860
You exist with reality.

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:14.860
So there is no mind to communicate

00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:20.180
we call it thoughtlessly aware - means what?

00:30:21.146 --> 00:30:26.860
We have conquered all our enemies
by giving up one enemy, that was our mind.

00:30:28.553 --> 00:30:31.020
There's no mind to suggest,

00:30:31.906 --> 00:30:34.220
there's no mind to tell you.

00:30:35.539 --> 00:30:39.153
So once there is no mind, you are lost.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.700
Now, it is being said that you ask
a question to yourself, “Who am I?”

00:30:48.826 --> 00:30:54.140
As soon as you ask this question, you
become thoughtless, so you get lost,

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.860
you cannot answer this question.

00:30:59.933 --> 00:31:04.460
Otherwise, you might say, “I
am a woman, I am this, I am that,

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:10.980
I am a bishop or I am a
pope, I am this, I am that”.

00:31:13.633 --> 00:31:16.465
But once you are a Realized soul,

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:20.700
who will tell you who you are? Because
the one which tells you is the mind,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.220
which doesn't exist, no thought.

00:31:26.466 --> 00:31:30.820
Means you get just dissolved into your Self.

00:31:34.426 --> 00:31:37.426
This is what is reality.

00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:41.660
But you are aware also.

00:31:42.006 --> 00:31:44.260
Now, that's another point.

00:31:49.506 --> 00:31:53.660
If you ask yourself a question, you are not there,

00:31:55.733 --> 00:31:57.953
but you are aware.

00:31:58.393 --> 00:32:03.580
If your Nabhi is catching, immediately you
know my nabhi is catching, I have got liver.

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:07.060
You don't have to ask questions.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:12.140
Or somebody is standing near you, “Left
Swadishthana, oh my God, it is this one”.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.540
If somebody is very angry and hot tempered,

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.192
immediately you’ll feel
such heat from that person,

00:32:22.393 --> 00:32:25.113
‘Oh baba, I´ll run away from this man”.

00:32:26.726 --> 00:32:29.300
So, this is a new

00:32:33.426 --> 00:32:36.932
realm you have entered into – reality,

00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:39.980
which you were never aware of before.

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:47.540
Now, supposing there's a
very bad man standing near you.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:53.460
He might be a thief, he
might be a murderer, anything.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.807
You will not be even conscious of it,

00:32:57.007 --> 00:32:59.940
leave alone aware, normally.

00:33:00.679 --> 00:33:03.540
But once you are a Realized soul,

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.919
you become aware of the whole

00:33:12.693 --> 00:33:14.940
that is reality.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.580
What are the problems in the collective,

00:33:21.993 --> 00:33:24.420
you become aware of the collective.

00:33:25.926 --> 00:33:28.980
You become aware of the
problems of the whole world.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.200
Now this awareness is very different.

00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:37.780
The first awareness, as I told you, is like this.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.420
That if somebody tells you that you are
this and this,

00:33:43.666 --> 00:33:46.380
you become aware of it.

00:33:48.946 --> 00:33:51.519
In this nobody has to tell you,

00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:56.420
it's just there.

00:34:00.846 --> 00:34:04.513
You are there, you know what it is.

00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:10.220
And this is what we have achieved,

00:34:11.813 --> 00:34:14.740
in these modern times.

00:34:15.813 --> 00:34:19.300
Which is the blessing of the modern times also,

00:34:19.846 --> 00:34:24.306
that we know now who we are.

00:34:25.786 --> 00:34:30.980
You always say, we are the pure
Spirit, yesterday also I heard it.

00:34:31.466 --> 00:34:33.340
Are you sure?

00:34:33.686 --> 00:34:36.300
What makes you believe that?

00:34:38.773 --> 00:34:41.500
That you are the pure Spirit.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.700
I mean you haven't seen your Spirit, have you?

00:34:47.813 --> 00:34:50.900
You haven't seen your Self, what you are.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.700
Then, how do you say that you are the pure Spirit?

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.420
It's just you're saying something,

00:34:59.206 --> 00:35:01.400
because I say so.

00:35:04.026 --> 00:35:06.780
But you are the pure spirit, because

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:12.700
whatever is the description
of the pure Spirit is given

00:35:13.086 --> 00:35:15.819
- that it is aware

00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:23.420
of the Divine Power.

00:35:25.299 --> 00:35:28.580
It is aware of the Divine Power

00:35:29.346 --> 00:35:33.820
and that is how you are the pure Spirit.

00:35:34.273 --> 00:35:37.479
Because only through pure Spirit,

00:35:37.846 --> 00:35:40.647
as your personality,

00:35:40.847 --> 00:35:44.112
you can be aware of

00:35:44.313 --> 00:35:47.900
this All-pervading power.

00:35:49.633 --> 00:35:56.060
This is written in all the shastras,
in all the scriptures, everywhere.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:00.300
And what do you know about yourself?

00:36:02.246 --> 00:36:04.420
That you are the Spirit.

00:36:04.999 --> 00:36:09.700
Because you know about your own chakras.

00:36:10.006 --> 00:36:13.220
You know about your own nadis.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.660
Now, what has happened is that
you are separated from yourself

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.860
and you can see yourself.

00:36:25.013 --> 00:36:28.460
You see yourself very clearly

00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:36.420
and you start seeing yourself as the present

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.420
and the past and the future.

00:36:41.813 --> 00:36:44.313
In the past, what I was,

00:36:44.513 --> 00:36:48.020
you see you are shocked,
oh, my goodness, I was like this.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.486
You see it,

00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:55.180
through this present state, in the present
state you see.

00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:59.940
Then you start forgetting it,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.987
forget the past, forget the past.

00:37:07.013 --> 00:37:09.506
Then still you have the future,

00:37:10.732 --> 00:37:16.120
then you start thinking about the future.

00:37:17.513 --> 00:37:23.180
First future they think about their own
children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

00:37:24.206 --> 00:37:30.260
“What will happen to my children,
what will happen to my wife?”

00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:35.900
Then they think, “What
will happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

00:37:37.946 --> 00:37:41.407
Then they think, “What will happen to Mataji?”

00:37:43.053 --> 00:37:46.300
Also, they think, “What
will happen to this world?”

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.900
Because your awareness

00:37:53.286 --> 00:37:55.940
has expanded.

00:37:58.433 --> 00:38:02.100
You are not in the limited sphere now, anymore.

00:38:04.546 --> 00:38:07.700
You can think of your children,
you can think of your wife,

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.540
also you can think of the whole world

00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:14.700
and all the problems of the world you think.

00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:22.180
So you have reached that state, all right

00:38:23.273 --> 00:38:25.473
– up to that state we are.

00:38:27.453 --> 00:38:29.820
Now what is the thing

00:38:32.613 --> 00:38:35.340
that covers up all this,

00:38:36.446 --> 00:38:42.180
or gives you solutions, say for your
children, for your family, your wife,

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.740
everyone – what is the solution?

00:38:47.026 --> 00:38:51.220
Your Mother believes in giving
the solutions, not only the problems.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:39:00.160
Because, these days, there are not
problems that existed in the Navaratri,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.113
they no more exist

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:08.620
– that you can take a

00:39:09.973 --> 00:39:14.780
sword in your hand and go
and kill somebody – no, it doesn't,

00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:18.793
it is not possible, cut what?

00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:25.060
So, today’s problems as they are, as we see,

00:39:27.487 --> 00:39:29.660
within us,

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.420
we see the problems, we are aware of it

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.940
and we want to do something about it.

00:39:37.426 --> 00:39:40.780
Whether we are in the past, present or future,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.420
we see the problem.

00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:50.940
So now, what is the solution?

00:39:52.459 --> 00:39:56.660
We have no weapons, nothing,

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.420
to fight.

00:40:02.306 --> 00:40:08.220
We don't know also, so many do not
even know how to hold a sword in the hand.

00:40:08.933 --> 00:40:11.940
And so many don't even want to hold it

00:40:13.413 --> 00:40:16.340
because they are so much in compassion,

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:20.300
in the ocean of compassion
enjoying themselves nicely.

00:40:21.326 --> 00:40:24.820
They are enjoying their own
compassion and the compassion of others,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.340
compassion of their Mother.

00:40:28.246 --> 00:40:31.220
But then how to solve the problem?

00:40:37.026 --> 00:40:41.180
The problem can be solved if you become

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.920
very powerful yourself within.

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:50.700
Where is your attention?

00:40:54.986 --> 00:40:57.660
You have to move inward.

00:40:58.353 --> 00:41:00.380
Where is your attention?

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:05.300
You have to become very powerful.

00:41:07.293 --> 00:41:11.660
I have done my job, I have given you Realization,

00:41:12.986 --> 00:41:15.340
you have grown so much.

00:41:15.846 --> 00:41:19.460
I have explained to you, I have
told you everything this time.

00:41:20.253 --> 00:41:22.940
I have given you lots of love,

00:41:24.313 --> 00:41:28.540
ocean of love I should say,
as you call it, whatever it is.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.860
But now you have to nourish yourself,

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:39.026
you have to become powerful within yourself.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.620
So what is the way you can become powerful?

00:41:51.986 --> 00:41:54.567
First, you must believe

00:41:54.767 --> 00:41:57.460
that you have transcended

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:03.653
your human personality and you
have now become a super human being.

00:42:11.033 --> 00:42:13.900
First of all, this must come in you.

00:42:15.946 --> 00:42:19.060
This is what we call as faith.

00:42:19.673 --> 00:42:21.980
This faith is not false faith,

00:42:22.181 --> 00:42:26.540
it is not blind faith that
you believe into something,

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.380
but it is a fact.

00:42:32.706 --> 00:42:35.060
I have, a hundred times, I have told you,

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.660
that you have to have first
of all faith in your ascent,

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.460
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:47.693 --> 00:42:50.780
For this, meditation is very important,

00:42:52.613 --> 00:42:54.613
very important.

00:42:55.046 --> 00:42:59.980
Without meditation you
cannot have full faith in yourself.

00:43:01.633 --> 00:43:07.506
Because you can't know yourself,
by saying “who am I”? You cannot.

00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:15.180
You try now asking the
question - who am I? You'll be lost.

00:43:23.707 --> 00:43:26.460
So what should be the faith then because

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.746
when you ask this question
“who am I”?, you are lost.

00:43:37.426 --> 00:43:43.580
So, you reach a stage where I
have to tell you that faith is not mental,

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.300
it is not emotional,

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.780
it is not physical,

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.540
but it is a state

00:43:52.439 --> 00:43:54.700
of your own being

00:43:56.146 --> 00:44:00.060
which we can call as a spiritual state.

00:44:05.692 --> 00:44:08.580
In the spiritual state,

00:44:11.666 --> 00:44:17.060
nothing can disturb you,

00:44:19.487 --> 00:44:22.340
nothing can overpower you,

00:44:23.507 --> 00:44:26.660
nothing can dominate you,

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.540
because that state if you have,

00:44:32.813 --> 00:44:38.460
that means you are part and parcel of reality,

00:44:40.426 --> 00:44:44.780
then you are an honoured member

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.980
of the God's kingdom.

00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:52.780
Then you are

00:44:54.706 --> 00:44:59.860
the most revered personality.

00:45:00.906 --> 00:45:04.020
Then you are like a deity,

00:45:05.446 --> 00:45:08.300
then you are like a Gana.

00:45:10.286 --> 00:45:14.700
In that state, when you
are, it's a state, again I say it,

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.140
beyond the human state,

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.246
you are extremely powerful.

00:45:32.613 --> 00:45:35.340
There is a story about Nizamuddin,

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.700
the great Auliya, great Sufi in India.

00:45:39.953 --> 00:45:42.500
There was a horrible king,

00:45:42.953 --> 00:45:45.780
I think what- shah, he called himself.

00:45:46.793 --> 00:45:49.940
And he would not go and bow to him

00:45:50.866 --> 00:45:55.940
and he was very angry. He said, “I
can only bow to God and to nobody [else]".

00:45:57.646 --> 00:46:01.380
This Shah said, “If you don't
come and bow to me tomorrow,

00:46:01.899 --> 00:46:05.100
I will cut your throat”.

00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:09.660
And that night the throat of this king was cut.

00:46:11.493 --> 00:46:15.020
It is a story, but it is a real story.

00:46:17.633 --> 00:46:21.060
Somebody came and cut his throat, it was not

00:46:22.173 --> 00:46:25.453
Nizamuddin Sahab. He would not do that.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.180
So that state, if you reach,

00:46:34.606 --> 00:46:36.780
what we call,

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.820
is a state of 'shraddha', [a] state of

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.620
'shraddha' which is enlightened,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.180
enlightened faith.

00:46:56.746 --> 00:47:02.707
It is a new type of mechanism.

00:47:06.813 --> 00:47:08.820
That is,

00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:13.020
you become part and parcel of the whole;

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.060
that means the moon, the stars - see.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:24.700
I tell you, I never told the sun
that it should be there for the Pujas

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.933
I never told last time, this time

00:47:27.133 --> 00:47:31.620
- I never tell him, there's
no need to tell, it is all done.

00:47:34.546 --> 00:47:38.679
I don't tell all these vibrations

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.660
to make a cross or to show all
these miraculous photographs.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.780
I don't tell them, there's no need to tell.

00:47:51.393 --> 00:47:55.453
They just do it by themselves,
I am sometimes surprised

00:47:55.653 --> 00:47:58.620
how the ingenious methods they have of their own,

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.540
how they manage things, I am myself surprised.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.400
I didn't tell them that these
two persons who were selected

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.386
by this award that they should be
so condemned by every newspaper.

00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:15.820
It all works automatically,

00:48:19.686 --> 00:48:21.900
it just works.

00:48:22.813 --> 00:48:27.380
Only thing, if I have anything, is just complete,

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.140
complete faith that I am at that state.

00:48:32.393 --> 00:48:36.820
And that's why there is complete
patience, 'saburi' [Marathi word].

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.020
Complete patience.

00:48:45.313 --> 00:48:48.900
And that is what we have to learn.

00:48:50.326 --> 00:48:53.060
It will all happen in any case,

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.260
because you are all at that state.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.620
Only meditation is important, very important.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.300
For me not, but for you all.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.780
If you all can meditate now, just

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:15.900
for 10 minutes also every day,

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:18.686
it will help you a lot.

00:49:19.946 --> 00:49:23.213
Now why do we have all these statues?

00:49:24.233 --> 00:49:26.300
The Mother,

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.740
Hanumana, and Ganesha, Christ.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:37.233
Because to begin with, human
beings cannot understand

00:49:37.433 --> 00:49:40.780
anything which does not have a form.

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:47.100
They cannot go deeper
unless and until there is a form.

00:49:48.553 --> 00:49:54.060
But they went to another limit of using
any stone, anything as God and all.

00:49:57.433 --> 00:49:59.700
But now you have discretion,

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.500
you know what is to be worshipped,

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:07.100
what is to be treated as

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.780
a higher personality, that you know.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.033
But before that,

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.373
they would worship all kinds of people like

00:50:17.573 --> 00:50:20.860
now people worship the
Pope, you know that, very well.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.279
But now what to do,

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.240
they are not only blind,

00:50:27.873 --> 00:50:33.180
they are not only unaware, but
they are also not conscious of it.

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:38.073
They are all at such a level
that you cannot tell them.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.100
So you are a new type of people, I should say,

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.540
who have tried to fight it out,

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.773
to struggle it out, to know

00:50:50.453 --> 00:50:52.940
about the absolute truth.

00:50:54.613 --> 00:50:57.900
Unless and until you know the absolute truth,

00:51:00.346 --> 00:51:02.580
you are nowhere,

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:07.980
you have no discretion, you have no
understanding, you have no wisdom.

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.900
But once you know the absolute truth,

00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.620
then you should not by any chance

00:51:19.186 --> 00:51:22.220
be half way this and half way that.

00:51:22.906 --> 00:51:25.500
That's a very dangerous

00:51:28.366 --> 00:51:32.740
state of affairs. Say a seed is sprouted,

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.420
it is neither a seed nor a tree.

00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:43.860
If it doesn't grow, it is useless.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:48.060
That happens to your awareness, I'm again talking

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.740
of your consciousness, awareness

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
- and then you are neither here nor there.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.340
There are many people

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.700
who come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.260
perhaps maybe to find some peace.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.880
But I get letters,

00:52:15.153 --> 00:52:19.500
"My father is sick, my mother
is sick, my sister is sick".

00:52:19.919 --> 00:52:24.620
And then otherwise, "My husband is
fighting with me, I'm seeking a divorce"

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.580
or thirdly, "I've lost all my
money, I must have some money".

00:52:30.399 --> 00:52:35.740
Fourthly, "I am a great
artist, but my art is not selling".

00:52:36.246 --> 00:52:41.460
All these stupid problems they bring.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.820
"My children are no good, they are troublesome,

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:52.093
then my wife is fighting with me, my mother
is fighting with me, brother is fighting with me".

00:52:52.293 --> 00:52:55.293
Now I said, what sort of Sahaja Yogis these are?

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.900
The state of being one with the reality,

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.940
means that the whole of reality is at your feet,

00:53:16.713 --> 00:53:18.940
the whole of it works for you.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.260
Now once you even get a glimpse of that state,

00:53:25.486 --> 00:53:30.060
I tell you, you become so much

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.300
peaceful within yourself.

00:53:38.147 --> 00:53:41.100
If you say, "I am the king, I am the king".

00:53:42.013 --> 00:53:45.300
If you say, "I am the beggar, I am the beggar".

00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:48.940
What difference does it make to that state?

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:54.420
It's is like the purest of pure gold,

00:53:54.919 --> 00:53:57.380
which cannot be tarnished.

00:54:01.712 --> 00:54:05.420
Such a state of mind we have to develop,

00:54:07.086 --> 00:54:10.500
it's more a challenge to us.

00:54:11.713 --> 00:54:14.020
We are Sahaja Yogis - all right.

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.740
We have got Realization - all right.

00:54:18.773 --> 00:54:21.420
We can sing very well - all right.

00:54:22.213 --> 00:54:25.060
We have achieved good positions - all right.

00:54:26.613 --> 00:54:29.260
We are nicely married - all right.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.020
We have got nice children, we have got everything,

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:36.453
we have got jobs, this, that - now.

00:54:37.506 --> 00:54:40.580
Suddenly one negative
force comes in to trouble you,

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.780
"So what?

00:54:46.426 --> 00:54:48.426
So what?"

00:54:51.626 --> 00:54:54.740
Otherwise, how will you know what you are?

00:54:57.686 --> 00:55:01.420
If there is no darkness, how
will you know you are the light?

00:55:04.299 --> 00:55:06.560
It's a challenge

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:11.300
to your own state,

00:55:11.793 --> 00:55:14.593
at what state you are.

00:55:15.213 --> 00:55:20.140
The word ‘state’ is not so
explanatory. In Sanskrit, it is ‘svarupa’.

00:55:20.813 --> 00:55:22.820
‘Sva – rupa’ .

00:55:26.146 --> 00:55:29.693
‘Sva’ is your Self and ‘rupa’

00:55:30.113 --> 00:55:32.900
is form or state.

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:40.500
That state is possible for all of you

00:55:42.999 --> 00:55:47.980
by saying, “Not this,
not this, not this, not this”.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.907
As it is, your mind

00:55:54.107 --> 00:55:57.767
has reached that state that there is no mind,

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.313
you can do that.

00:56:01.433 --> 00:56:07.226
But you have to develop a kind of a personality

00:56:08.106 --> 00:56:10.980
that realizes what you are.

00:56:15.127 --> 00:56:17.860
But in that realization,

00:56:20.973 --> 00:56:23.580
you are just aware of it,

00:56:24.206 --> 00:56:26.279
not conscious of it.

00:56:26.493 --> 00:56:28.820
I'll, for example, I’ll tell you.

00:56:30.406 --> 00:56:34.300
I'm aware I am Adi Shakti, I am aware I know,

00:56:34.613 --> 00:56:40.260
but when you say, “Shri
Mataji”, I also say, “Jai Shri Mataji”.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:44.060
Forgetting that I am the
one you are talking about.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.420
This is actually, should be the state,

00:56:54.133 --> 00:56:57.880
that you are aware, yes,
you are aware in the sense,

00:56:58.759 --> 00:57:02.740
I don't know how to say, but
I'm aware I am that. If you ask me,

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:06.060
“Mother, are you Adi Shakti?” I say, “Yes, I am“.

00:57:08.206 --> 00:57:11.180
Because I know that, that I am.

00:57:11.666 --> 00:57:16.700
But when you say, “Jai Shri
Mataji”, I forget that I am Adi Shakti

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.220
and I also say, “Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.133
I forget, I have to tell
you, “No, no, you can’t say it”.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.420
It is very interesting. Now, you
make me sit here like a queen

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:41.620
and give me presents, this
thing, that thing. I mean, all right,

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.380
that's your idea.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.846
But to me, you see, I am

00:57:51.286 --> 00:57:54.340
complete in myself - I think so.

00:57:57.947 --> 00:58:02.780
This is in Hindi: "Me kahenge ki
hum apne hi andar samma gaye".

00:58:04.206 --> 00:58:08.700
"I am got lost into myself".

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.392
All right, you do this, all right,
you should do that, all right.

00:58:13.593 --> 00:58:16.379
If you don't do it, it's all right.

00:58:18.587 --> 00:58:21.860
To me, it makes no difference,
it may make a difference to you,

00:58:22.525 --> 00:58:24.612
but to me it does not.

00:58:24.813 --> 00:58:30.085
Like, I've been saying, "That don't give me any
presents, don't give me any presents", all these days.

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:34.260
So, the only argument is that,
"The whole year we give you once,

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:38.060
so why should your Mother
object, because that gives us joy".

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:41.180
All right, if you think it gives you joy, do it.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.140
But to me, it doesn't matter.

00:58:48.913 --> 00:58:52.020
Because, I don't think I am there.

00:58:55.033 --> 00:58:58.580
I'm just seeing you sitting here,

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:03.340
"All right, they are all
Realized souls, all right".

00:59:06.319 --> 00:59:08.580
But I am one of you.

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:13.040
I don't think I am very special.

00:59:13.979 --> 00:59:16.300
But if you ask me,

00:59:16.693 --> 00:59:22.140
then I will say, "All right I am Adi Shakti".
But I don't think Adi Shakti is very special also.

00:59:25.706 --> 00:59:27.900
Because I have no mind.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.820
But otherwise, I don't
think it's something special.

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.080
Because somebody is somebody, so what?

00:59:35.246 --> 00:59:39.900
Now supposing, sun is sun, so what? He is the sun.

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.620
If somebody is Adi Shakti, so Adi Shakti, so what?

00:59:47.666 --> 00:59:53.180
But for you it is creditable,
because you were not born Realized.

00:59:54.206 --> 00:59:56.580
You got your Realization,

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.220
so you are special,

01:00:01.013 --> 01:00:04.220
you are great, you have achieved something.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:08.420
I have achieved nothing, I have
been like this and I will be like this.

01:00:12.306 --> 01:00:18.140
Whether I fight the devils, or I sit before
you, makes no difference, I will be like this.

01:00:18.746 --> 01:00:21.860
But for me, you are great

01:00:22.226 --> 01:00:24.653
because you have achieved this.

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:28.500
Today, to see you on this Navaratri day,

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.900
so many people sitting to worship me.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.820
So many people are here,

01:00:38.587 --> 01:00:41.020
so many Sahaja Yogis,

01:00:41.373 --> 01:00:43.460
it's so remarkable!

01:00:44.199 --> 01:00:48.300
It is not my achievement,
I tell you. It's your seeking.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.220
Because I have been on
this earth many a times before

01:00:54.226 --> 01:00:56.380
that you know.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.860
But we never had like this,

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.900
so many came and got crucified, died, this, that

01:01:03.206 --> 01:01:05.840
- but I never had people of this kind.

01:01:08.512 --> 01:01:11.620
So again we come to the same point,

01:01:12.713 --> 01:01:16.180
that we should

01:01:17.433 --> 01:01:20.680
be aware of ourselves

01:01:21.686 --> 01:01:24.780
complete 'shraddha' in yourself.

01:01:25.386 --> 01:01:28.660
If you have some 'shraddha' in yourself,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.860
you will have 'shraddha' about Me also.

01:01:32.633 --> 01:01:35.100
Because we are not different.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.260
If you believe this is water,

01:01:41.759 --> 01:01:45.860
then everywhere there is water
then I believe that that is water, isn't it?

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.260
Because I know this is water,

01:01:50.453 --> 01:01:54.260
so wherever in the world
there is water, I know it is water.

01:01:56.206 --> 01:01:59.106
So if you know you are a Sahaja Yogi,

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.380
anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi, you will
know there is a Sahaja Yogi, that's a Sahaja Yogi.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.900
But as far as you are concerned you forget

01:02:12.526 --> 01:02:16.680
how great you are and how far you can go.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.180
I am very proud of you, you don't know,

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:25.700
but because I am a humble person,

01:02:26.613 --> 01:02:29.060
I don't know how to show off.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.260
So I have such nice children, so many of them,

01:02:35.693 --> 01:02:38.000
so lovable,

01:02:39.986 --> 01:02:45.860
those bhaktas for whom she
killed so many demons and all that.

01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:49.493
They are not like you,

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:56.340
you are much better, much
higher, of a much greater quality.

01:02:56.633 --> 01:03:00.780
But you must know that you are.

01:03:01.086 --> 01:03:06.860
And don't behave like those people who

01:03:07.233 --> 01:03:11.740
were of a very rudimentary nature.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:16.180
You have grown up, you have prospered

01:03:16.946 --> 01:03:20.046
and now the fruits, we can see.

01:03:22.993 --> 01:03:25.980
I don't know what to do for you really,

01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:29.940
but have faith in yourself,

01:03:32.525 --> 01:03:36.780
then you will see how much
faith you will have in reality.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:42.540
That there is reality with you
at every step, every moment.

01:03:46.812 --> 01:03:49.260
No fear,

01:03:52.193 --> 01:03:55.060
no sense of achievement, nothing!

01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.826
Done now, finished!

01:04:00.013 --> 01:04:04.385
When there were five Sahaja Yogis, I was
happy. When there are so many, I am happy.

01:04:04.586 --> 01:04:09.540
But when I see so many, I feel

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:13.980
there are so many powerful

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.560
personalities who are one with reality.

01:04:20.793 --> 01:04:24.700
This collective oneness,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.900
was never so.

01:04:28.833 --> 01:04:34.820
And so, I will say that on this day,

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:39.660
what we have to do is to kill
the devils within ourselves.

01:04:41.906 --> 01:04:43.980
That's all.

01:04:45.113 --> 01:04:49.780
If you want to really worship
me, that's what you have to think,

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:54.380
what are the devils within you, that's all!

01:04:54.926 --> 01:04:59.926
So, you don't have to worry otherwise for
outside devils, they cannot do anything to you.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.760
May God bless you.
