1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,857
Now, put your left hand towards Me, comfortably.

2
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:15,426
Put your feet apart from each other.

3
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:19,552
And now put your right hand on your heart

4
00:00:19,752 --> 00:00:23,107
and close your eyes.

5
00:00:29,185 --> 00:00:33,770
Here you have to ask Me a very important question,

6
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,149
in your heart.

7
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:40,715
You ask Me a question as you would ask a computer.

8
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,306
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”, whatever you like.

9
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:48,403
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

10
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:52,248
Ask the question, in your heart, not loudly.

11
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:55,661
Three times ask in your heart, not loudly,

12
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,826
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,973
You have to only ask in your heart.

14
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:16,618
If you are the spirit you become your own guide,

15
00:01:16,818 --> 00:01:22,482
you become your own master, you become your own guru.

16
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,264
So now take down your right hand

17
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:31,782
into the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

18
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:39,877
And here you have to ask another question,

19
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:44,488
three times, not loudly, in your heart,

20
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:52,951
“Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own master?”

21
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:57,012
Ask this question three times.

22
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:16,838
“Am I my own master?”

23
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:25,313
I have told you that I respect your freedom,

24
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:30,157
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on you.

25
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:34,202
So please take your right hand

26
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:39,055
in the lower portion of your abdomen,

27
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:44,696
and say it six times, asking Me,

28
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:48,418
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

29
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:54,625
I cannot force on you. You have to ask in your free will.

30
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:17,161
As soon as you ask for the pure knowledge,

31
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:20,282
the kundalini starts moving upward.

32
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:23,096
So now we have to nourish

33
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:28,549
the higher centers with our self-confidence.

34
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:41,293
Raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,915
Press it hard, on the left-hand side.

36
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:51,069
And here with full confidence you have to say ten times,

37
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,555
in your heart, not loudly,

38
00:03:55,755 --> 00:04:00,020
“Mother, I am my own master.” Please say this ten times,

39
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,895
“Mother, I am my own master.”

40
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,522
I told you at the very outset

41
00:04:27,722 --> 00:04:31,064
that the greatest truth about you is that

42
00:04:31,264 --> 00:04:36,080
you are not this body, you are not this mind,

43
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,406
you are not these conditionings, emotions, nor this ego,

44
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:46,109
but you are the spirit. You are the pure spirit.

45
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:50,075
So now raise your right hand

46
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:59,425
onto your heart and ask here,

47
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:09,166
or say with full confidence, twelve times,

48
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:13,198
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

49
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:18,318
Just say it without any hesitation.

50
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,991
Say it twelve times, please.

51
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:43,621
For your information you have to know

52
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:50,170
that the divine Power is the source of knowledge,

53
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,846
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of love.

54
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:03,034
It is the ocean of peace and ocean of bliss.

55
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:09,321
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

56
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:12,152
So you cannot commit any mistake

57
00:06:12,352 --> 00:06:17,999
which cannot be dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

58
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,892
So please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck,

59
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,434
and your shoulder,

60
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:28,703
push it back as much as possible

61
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,477
and turn your head to your right,

62
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:38,351
and with full confidence please say sixteen times,

63
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:42,091
full confidence, in your heart,

64
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:49,107
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

65
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,055
All right.

66
00:07:08,356 --> 00:07:15,861
As I told you before that you have to forgive everyone,

67
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,782
and those who say it is difficult, they must know

68
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:23,976
that it is a myth whether you forgive or don’t forgive.

69
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:27,327
But if you don’t forgive then you play into the wrong hands

70
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:31,320
and get yourself tortured by yourself.

71
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,690
So please forgive – in general, everyone,

72
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,937
not counting how many people you have to forgive,

73
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:39,347
what you have to forgive – but just say,

74
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:44,025
by raising your hand and putting it

75
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,769
on top of your forehead across,

76
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,360
putting down your head as much as possible,

77
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,371
resting on your hand.

78
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:59,982
Please say, with an open heart please say,

79
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:05,107
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

80
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:14,314
Please say it, please say;

81
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:17,099
otherwise it is difficult later on for Me:

82
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:20,923
I have to clear out everybody’s Agnya

83
00:08:21,123 --> 00:08:23,426
and this takes too much time then.

84
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:26,453
So best is to say it from your heart. After all,

85
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:31,912
you are not going to miss your Self-realization for that.

86
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:42,326
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head,

87
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,469
and put your head on it,

88
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:50,276
resting on it, upward.

89
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:54,307
Here you have to say for your own satisfaction,

90
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:59,547
“Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

91
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,510
But don’t feel guilty,

92
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,241
don’t count your mistakes, don’t think about them.

93
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:05,913
In general you have to say,

94
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:12,445
“Oh Divine, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes

95
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:20,249
or anything wrong, anything against You.”

96
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,859
Now, stretch your palm,

97
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:27,514
stretch your palm and put the center of your palm

98
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:31,750
on top of the fontanel bone area

99
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,529
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

100
00:09:35,729 --> 00:09:40,897
Now put down your head properly.

101
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:46,255
And here push back your fingers as far as possible.

102
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,028
Please push back. This is very important.

103
00:09:49,228 --> 00:09:52,258
And now put a pressure on your scalp,

104
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,087
and move your scalp slowly

105
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:58,444
seven times clockwise.

106
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,907
Here again I respect your freedom,

107
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:06,222
and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

108
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:09,200
So here you have to say seven times,

109
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,828
bending your head properly

110
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,001
and pressing it hard, moving seven times,

111
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:19,602
“Mother, please give me my Self-realization.”

112
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:23,922
Please ask seven times, please.
