THE OPENING OF SAHASTRARA CHAKRA

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:19.812
5th MAY 1970, NARGOL (INDIA)

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:49.252
And it happened that I really saw
the Sahastrara.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.534
(…) there’s a difference between
your Sahastrara and Mine.

00:00:53.735 --> 00:01:00.150
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is big
Sahastrara opened out beautifully.

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:08.578
And the petals were just like flames –

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.774
rounded flames, not like flames,
but rounded ones,

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:19.188
rounded beautifully coloured flames
of different colours.

00:01:19.397 --> 00:01:25.377
'Cause I saw so many permutations
and combinations of these,

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.434
so pronounced, so beautiful.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:37.075
And as if every petal was individually,
absolutely complete and perfect,

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:41.195
but so integrated to the base. And the way
it opened out,

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:44.844
and the movement was so rhythmic
and so harmonious.

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:47.577
There was no problem. Such a harmony
was between them.

00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:51.069
No fluctuation anywhere,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.646
as if they were dancing to the tunes,
opened out.

00:01:55.847 --> 00:02:01.108
And the colors, all spread out their light
around with the auras,

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:08.163
and in the center I saw the Agnya, beaming
in tear [?] and you can say the Sun color;

00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:13.139
and all the chakras were there, also
emitting lights,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.725
but the chakras were darker in shades
and they were emitting,

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:22.014
so dark that they were all looking blackish,
you see, so dark.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:30.568
Sort of a condensed colour they had.
And they were also emitting light all over.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.782
And the light - as soon as the whole thing
opened out, the light absolutely spread out.

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:44.635
And then I said: “It’s done. It can
be done”.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:48.139
So first I had to open out My Sahastrara
itself,

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.397
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:56.962
And then I felt that a tremendous flow

00:02:57.163 --> 00:03:01.427
of My grace started flowing.

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:06.198
So much grace moving up on Me.

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:10.845
My own principle [?] torrential rain,
you see, falling on Me.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:17.134
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy,
really I was lost, absolutely lost.

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:26.964
Then I felt that the whole creation is now

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:36.423
resounding with that Universal
Consciousness, just felt that way.

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:41.859
Everything was finished, only the joy of it
was permeating.

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:54.027
The Sahastrara is the blessing
of the heavens, I should say.

00:03:54.228 --> 00:04:00.222
It has worked out so well. It’s very
difficult to break the Sahastrara.

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:08.363
And when I really broke it, I didn’t know
that it would be that successful.

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:11.394
First, I thought is still premature

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:19.355
because there are many Rakshasas still
on the street, selling their goods;

00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:24.259
and there are many fanatics who are calling
themselves by the so-called religions

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.589
they are following, not the real religion
of the Atma.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.370
But, gradually it has taken its roots.
Now, let this truth

00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:40.639
take its root within yourself through
your Sahastrara.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.933
And once this truth becomes absolutely
the light that guides you,

00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:52.828
the light that nourishes you, the light
that enlightens you and gives you

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:58.073
a personality that has the light, then only
you should know

00:04:58.274 --> 00:05:02.553
that your Sahastrara is completely
enlightened by your Spirit.

00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:06.340
Your face should be such that people
should know

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:11.973
that there's a personality who’s standing
before you who is light.

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:16.182
This is how Sahastrara is to be looked
after.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:22.308
Please close your eyes.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.277
As it is, Kundalini has risen quite high.
I feel it.

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:33.075
But it has to cross through the last point,
which is the seventh center

00:05:33.276 --> 00:05:41.151
called as Sahastrara to pierce through
the hole of -

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:43.977
is called as the Brahma,
is the Brahmarandhra

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:49.727
where you get your Baptism, the real
Baptism, actualizing it.

00:05:49.928 --> 00:05:52.821
Please close your eyes.

00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:55.693
Just don't open your eyes.

00:05:55.894 --> 00:06:02.329
That's very important part of Sahaj Yoga
that you don't open your eyes.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:06.959
Because, if you open your eyes,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.513
then the Kundalini doesn't rise above
the Agnya chakra which is the sixth center.

00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:15.795
Put your right hand on your heart.
Don't open your eyes, please,

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:22.757
but put your right hand on your heart.
Then ask a question -

00:06:24.152 --> 00:06:28.670
for those who have not yet got their
Realization fully established -

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.397
ask a question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?".

00:06:31.598 --> 00:06:35.530
And the Sahaj Yogis have to say,
"Mother, I’m the Spirit."

00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:42.106
In your heart. You need not say loudly.
Thrice.

00:07:59.088 --> 00:08:03.099
Put your left hand on top of your head.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.972
Are you feeling? Little... not touching it,

00:08:10.173 --> 00:08:16.727
keep it higher, higher, still higher,
on the place

00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:22.938
where we call it as a taloo, where
the fontanel bone area,

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:25.046
where it was soft when you were a child.

00:08:25.247 --> 00:08:30.882
Bring it nearer to the head and see if you
are feeling the Cool Breeze coming out.

00:08:37.609 --> 00:08:40.433
May God bless you.
