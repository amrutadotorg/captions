THE OPENING OF SAHASTRARA CHAKRA

00:10.810 --> 00:19.812
5th MAY 1970, NARGOL (INDIA)

00:43.962 --> 00:49.252
And it happened that I really saw
the Sahastrara.

00:49.469 --> 00:53.534
(…) there’s a difference between
your Sahastrara and Mine.

00:53.735 --> 01:00.150
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is big
Sahastrara opened out beautifully.

01:00.646 --> 01:08.578
And the petals were just like flames –

01:08.819 --> 01:13.774
rounded flames, not like flames,
but rounded ones,

01:13.975 --> 01:19.188
rounded beautifully coloured flames
of different colours.

01:19.397 --> 01:25.377
'Cause I saw so many permutations
and combinations of these,

01:27.119 --> 01:30.434
so pronounced, so beautiful.

01:30.635 --> 01:37.075
And as if every petal was individually,
absolutely complete and perfect,

01:37.276 --> 01:41.195
but so integrated to the base. And the way
it opened out,

01:41.396 --> 01:44.844
and the movement was so rhythmic
and so harmonious.

01:45.045 --> 01:47.577
There was no problem. Such a harmony
was between them.

01:47.778 --> 01:51.069
No fluctuation anywhere,

01:51.270 --> 01:55.646
as if they were dancing to the tunes,
opened out.

01:55.847 --> 02:01.108
And the colors, all spread out their light
around with the auras,

02:01.309 --> 02:08.163
and in the center I saw the Agnya, beaming
in tear [?] and you can say the Sun color;

02:08.364 --> 02:13.139
and all the chakras were there, also
emitting lights,

02:13.340 --> 02:17.725
but the chakras were darker in shades
and they were emitting,

02:17.926 --> 02:22.014
so dark that they were all looking blackish,
you see, so dark.

02:22.215 --> 02:30.568
Sort of a condensed colour they had.
And they were also emitting light all over.

02:30.770 --> 02:37.782
And the light - as soon as the whole thing
opened out, the light absolutely spread out.

02:37.983 --> 02:44.635
And then I said: “It’s done. It can
be done”.

02:44.836 --> 02:48.139
So first I had to open out My Sahastrara
itself,

02:48.340 --> 02:52.397
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

02:52.598 --> 02:56.962
And then I felt that a tremendous flow

02:57.163 --> 03:01.427
of My grace started flowing.

03:01.627 --> 03:06.198
So much grace moving up on Me.

03:06.399 --> 03:10.845
My own principle [?] torrential rain,
you see, falling on Me.

03:11.046 --> 03:17.134
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy,
really I was lost, absolutely lost.

03:17.335 --> 03:26.964
Then I felt that the whole creation is now

03:27.165 --> 03:36.423
resounding with that Universal
Consciousness, just felt that way.

03:36.624 --> 03:41.859
Everything was finished, only the joy of it
was permeating.

03:49.058 --> 03:54.027
The Sahastrara is the blessing
of the heavens, I should say.

03:54.228 --> 04:00.222
It has worked out so well. It’s very
difficult to break the Sahastrara.

04:00.423 --> 04:08.363
And when I really broke it, I didn’t know
that it would be that successful.

04:08.564 --> 04:11.394
First, I thought is still premature

04:11.595 --> 04:19.355
because there are many Rakshasas still
on the street, selling their goods;

04:19.556 --> 04:24.259
and there are many fanatics who are calling
themselves by the so-called religions

04:24.460 --> 04:29.589
they are following, not the real religion
of the Atma.

04:29.790 --> 04:36.370
But, gradually it has taken its roots.
Now, let this truth

04:36.571 --> 04:40.639
take its root within yourself through
your Sahastrara.

04:40.840 --> 04:46.933
And once this truth becomes absolutely
the light that guides you,

04:47.134 --> 04:52.828
the light that nourishes you, the light
that enlightens you and gives you

04:53.029 --> 04:58.073
a personality that has the light, then only
you should know

04:58.274 --> 05:02.553
that your Sahastrara is completely
enlightened by your Spirit.

05:02.754 --> 05:06.340
Your face should be such that people
should know

05:06.541 --> 05:11.973
that there's a personality who’s standing
before you who is light.

05:12.174 --> 05:16.182
This is how Sahastrara is to be looked
after.

05:19.305 --> 05:22.308
Please close your eyes.

05:23.320 --> 05:28.277
As it is, Kundalini has risen quite high.
I feel it.

05:28.478 --> 05:33.075
But it has to cross through the last point,
which is the seventh center

05:33.276 --> 05:41.151
called as Sahastrara to pierce through
the hole of -

05:41.352 --> 05:43.977
is called as the Brahma,
is the Brahmarandhra

05:44.178 --> 05:49.727
where you get your Baptism, the real
Baptism, actualizing it.

05:49.928 --> 05:52.821
Please close your eyes.

05:53.882 --> 05:55.693
Just don't open your eyes.

05:55.894 --> 06:02.329
That's very important part of Sahaj Yoga
that you don't open your eyes.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.959
Because, if you open your eyes,

06:07.160 --> 06:12.513
then the Kundalini doesn't rise above
the Agnya chakra which is the sixth center.

06:12.714 --> 06:15.795
Put your right hand on your heart.
Don't open your eyes, please,

06:15.996 --> 06:22.757
but put your right hand on your heart.
Then ask a question -

06:24.152 --> 06:28.670
for those who have not yet got their
Realization fully established -

06:28.871 --> 06:31.397
ask a question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?".

06:31.598 --> 06:35.530
And the Sahaj Yogis have to say,
"Mother, I’m the Spirit."

06:35.731 --> 06:42.106
In your heart. You need not say loudly.
Thrice.

07:59.088 --> 08:03.099
Put your left hand on top of your head.

08:04.400 --> 08:09.972
Are you feeling? Little... not touching it,

08:10.173 --> 08:16.727
keep it higher, higher, still higher,
on the place

08:16.928 --> 08:22.938
where we call it as a taloo, where
the fontanel bone area,

08:23.139 --> 08:25.046
where it was soft when you were a child.

08:25.247 --> 08:30.882
Bring it nearer to the head and see if you
are feeling the Cool Breeze coming out.

08:37.609 --> 08:40.433
May God bless you.
