3
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,230
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

4
00:00:47,230 --> 00:01:14,900
As I’ve told you before that these are special
times, and times when we are very confused.

5
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:24,310
We are confused because so many things are
in the atmosphere.

6
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,200
Moreover there is a special urge to search
the truth.

7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:41,610
This is a very special thing of the modern
times that people want to search the truth.

8
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:50,350
They think perhaps that there is something
beyond that they have to seek.

9
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,800
They feel they are not satisfied with whatever
they have.

10
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,380
They feel whatever is going on in this world
is not all right.

11
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:13,440
Perhaps they feel that human beings are not
on the right track, that we have to take to

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,080
something else, something different, something
higher.

13
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:28,590
But first of all when we are seeking, we must
understand that it should be based on the

14
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,530
tradition of seeking.

15
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:40,590
For example, when you see these lights here
you know that it was discovered gradually,

16
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,760
first through principles then little more
then little more, till they discovered these

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,040
lights for us.

18
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:02,250
But in the seeking, today the problem is human
being has become not independent, but arbitrary.

19
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:11,400
He has no relationship with the whole, and
anybody who tries to find out a new method,

20
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:18,050
a new idea, a new way, people jump at it.

21
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,760
This is the character of the modern times.

22
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Also media and everybody tries to support
anything new comes up.

23
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,960
In seeking also it has happened.

24
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:45,180
Whatever the ancient people, the scriptures
have found out for us is not to be wasted.

25
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,891
We have to base our findings, our path, on
the same experiences that they have had and

26
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:57,900
use them for our purpose, is a sensible thing.

27
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:08,930
Like a boy gets a lot of money, say from his
parents, he uses that and then builds up his

28
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:16,959
own business, very rarely he’ll throw away
all that and start something new venture and

29
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,940
end up into bankruptcy.

30
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,481
This is one of the problems we are facing.

31
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:32,039
So I have seen that people suddenly take to
new methods.

32
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:42,460
Like I was in Pune the other day and I met
some very learned Sanskrit scholars, and I

33
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,370
was amazed that they all were suffering from
all kinds of diseases of a very serious nature.

34
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,670
They said we have a guru, another said he
had a guru.

35
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,540
I said, “How is it you are suffering from
diseases?

36
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:07,660
If you have a guru at least your health should
be all right, at least minimum of minimum.”

37
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,910
“Oh,” they said, “No, this is something
we are doing, very serious work.”

38
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,570
I said, “What is that?”

39
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,340
They started giving Me names Urnopait, Turnopait,
this, that.

40
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,560
They said that our guru gives us a shaktipath.

41
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,820
I said, “What is all that I have never heard
it.

42
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,180
In what book have you found it?

43
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,940
Is it in Vedas?

44
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,150
Is it in Puranas?

45
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,150
Is it in the Gita?

46
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,639
Or is it in the Bible or Koran, where is it?

47
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,560
Did Lao Tse talk about it or Socrates?

48
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,990
From where do you get this word shaktipath
suddenly?

49
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,890
I’ve never heard about it.”

50
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,210
So they said about sixty, seventy years back
there was a gentleman called Vishnutirth,

51
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,500
he has written a book, a book, and all this
is based on that shaktipath business.

52
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,720
I said, “I have never heard of this Vishnutirth.”

53
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:09,960
And he started a new fad, and this fad you
have accepted; paying no attention to what

54
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:19,510
Gita has to say, no attention to what Vedas
have to say, no attention to what other scriptures

55
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,770
have to say about your ascent.

56
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,330
You accepted this gentleman out of the blue.

57
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:36,750
Last hundred years in India we have had such
funny people, they produced books after books,

58
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,730
even in English language.

59
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:46,311
All these books were translated in English,
German and all these languages which has no

60
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,110
basis, no connection, no relevance whatsoever
to the ancient books.

61
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:56,990
I read a book by one German fellow who must
have taken some, I don’t know, idea from

62
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,810
half baked personalities in India, somebody
who knows little bit of Sanskrit and lot of

63
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,350
English or maybe something, he wrote such
a funny book where he said the kundalini is

64
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,100
in your stomach.

65
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,270
And this fellow says when the kundalini is
awakened then you start jumping like a frog,

66
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,170
or you start making noises like a lion.

67
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:25,370
I said, “Now, are you going to become a
frog and then an earthworm?”

68
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:32,050
All these funny ideas are worked out.

69
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:38,870
Maybe it is an ego trip or maybe it’s some
sort of a befooling going on.

70
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:46,590
The other day only, I met somebody in Germany;
there were thirty people in a group and their

71
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,520
so-called teacher came to see Me, and they
all.

72
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,389
And I said, “What are you teaching them?”

73
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,389
He said, “I am teaching them Prana moksha.”

74
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,389
In Sanskrit language this word means death.

75
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:56,380
I was quite shocked, what is he teaching there?

76
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,900
I said, “What sort of a Prana moksha are
you teaching them?”

77
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,630
He said, “I circulate the air into my body
and then I make the air go here and there.”

78
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,730
So I said, “What difference will it make
if the air goes here or there or here or anywhere,

79
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,770
what difference is it going to make?”

80
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,930
But he was quite confident about it.

81
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,130
He said, “You must give me more time.

82
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,940
I’ll talk to You about it.”

83
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,630
His kundalini was all frozen, absolutely,
he had no realization, nothing, and he was

84
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,180
boasting as if he knew every thing about it.

85
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,300
I was amazed at his confidence, really, and
I said that these thirty people tomorrow will

86
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:45,130
be suffering from horrible diseases or they
might end up in a lunatic asylum.

87
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:52,540
It may be some of the seekers might have reached
a state that they are so frustrated with all

88
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,950
this nonsense, that they might be wanting
just to kill themselves.

89
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,249
They might have joined him for this Prana
moksha.

90
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:04,110
I can’t understand, why did they join this
nonsensical thing?

91
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:12,899
So, it is in India also we have such people
who take to new things, even in Western countries

92
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,050
we are finding all kinds of new things coming
out.

93
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:22,819
Like we have now, say Christ came in, now
as soon as Christ came there was an attack

94
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:23,819
on Christianity.

95
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,550
As I told you last time, Paul.

96
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,639
Paul came to attack Christianity, absolutely
he is anti-Christ man, because he just neutralized

97
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,920
Christ in his writings.

98
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,910
When I first saw him there I said, “Who
is this Mr. Paul here, what is he doing?”

99
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,220
And he cannot understand the mystery of God.

100
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,660
He cannot think what greatness God’s powers
are.

101
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,720
How can he describe?

102
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,920
He himself was epileptic, according to us
that means he was a possessed man.

103
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,730
Not only epileptic, he had other problems.

104
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,619
He had killed many Christians and suddenly
he becomes a very nice man.

105
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:10,999
Same with Augustine, he was another attack.

106
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:16,720
Now thank God that Paul is exposed, and now
we have two types of Christians, those who

107
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,589
believe in Christ and those who believe in
Paul.

108
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:22,250
You cannot intellectualize.

109
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,119
No, you cannot intellectualize Christ.

110
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:31,309
You cannot intellectualize God, you cannot,
He is beyond your intellect, you cannot understand

111
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,610
Him through your intellect.

112
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,110
If you have to understand him you have to
become the spirit.

113
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,470
Christ has clearly said that you are to be
born again.

114
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,610
And when Nicodemus asked, “How am I to be
born again, I have to enter into the womb

115
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,029
of my mother?”

116
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:53,740
Christ said, “No, that what is flesh will
produce flesh.

117
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,240
You have to be born again by the Holy Ghost.”

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,850
If you remember Christ was killed in no time;
if was given time He would have told you what

119
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,850
Holy Ghost is.

120
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,850
Holy Ghost is the Kundalini within.

121
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,410
She is going to give you the second birth.

122
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:19,439
It’s a living process, and a living process
that should take place spontaneously.

123
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:23,410
All living processes take place spontaneously.

124
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:31,499
It is not that you can make a seed sprout
by taking out, pulling out its primule.

125
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:32,829
You cannot force it.

126
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:41,509
You cannot put some sort of a yoga system
on that seed that it should sprout.

127
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:48,681
It has to just be embedded in the Mother Earth,
and the Mother Earth has the capacity and

128
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:50,519
it sprouts.

129
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,880
So all these new ideas come in and for an
intellectual, he being a right-sided person,

130
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,540
it’s a great thing to see something new.

131
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,490
And that’s why sometimes people of My age
group here in England are quite shocked to

132
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,490
see how things have changed in this short
time.

133
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,810
How people have taken to absurd things.

134
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:17,360
Why have they accepted this kind of absurdity
and even the law goes in their favor, because

135
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,810
law has to be democratic, it has to accept
whatever people say.

136
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,639
Tomorrow if many people decide to commit suicide
the law will say, all right, by law you are

137
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,199
allowed to commit suicide.

138
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,910
What can the law do?

139
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:37,990
They allow all kinds of nonsensical perverted
sexual behavior, and in ‘73 when I went

140
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,550
to America I told them there will be a horrible
disease coming in which will stop all this

141
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,550
nonsense.

142
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,560
And they were very angry with Me, nobody would
listen to Me.

143
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,382
But other gurus said, “It’s all right,
that’s your culture, do what you like, we

144
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:53,382
have nothing to say.

145
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:58,700
Only thing, as long as you give us money we
are satisfied.

146
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,029
Nothing more is wanted for you to do, you
do, that’s your culture, this is our culture.”

147
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:06,989
Even lamas say that, lamas when they come
down all the way from there, they are only

148
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:08,999
interested in taking money from here.

149
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:14,329
They said, that’s your culture, this is
our culture; as if Christians had a culture

150
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:22,110
which was nothing to do with righteousness,
nothing to do with virtue, nothing to do with

151
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,170
purity.

152
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,989
Was that a animal’s culture that was preached
here?

153
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:34,180
But that’s what people accepted, because
they just wanted your money.

154
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,000
It’s a spontaneous process, you cannot pay
for it.

155
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,839
And once you understand this simple point
that you cannot pay for it, is a spontaneous

156
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,410
thing, it is your own, it is within your being,
that this kundalini resides.

157
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:57,239
And it resides in such a way that it notes
everything that you do, it’s like a tape

158
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,239
recorder.

159
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:04,040
It’s your mother, and she is never going
to harm you, but she knows about her child.

160
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:11,449
She is your individual mother, and she is
the pure desire within you.

161
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,839
All other desires are impure desires.

162
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,519
It’s an energy, an energy which is the reflection
of the Holy Ghost, because Holy Ghost is the

163
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,809
energy of God, which is all-pervading.

164
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:33,089
This energy resides in the triangular bone,
and the Greeks knew about it because they

165
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,399
called the bone as sacrum.

166
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:43,360
This all your own, you don’t have to go
any where else to find God.

167
00:14:43,360 --> 00:15:06,009
(Let her have a chair, get her a chair here,
she wants to come closer to Me, this little

168
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,009
child.

169
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:11,660
All right, please be seated.

170
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,620
She’s a born-realized person.

171
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,570
How are you?)

172
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:33,660
So, these great things are available to you,
at your command you have got it, and the times

173
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,619
have come, so many people have to get realization.

174
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:44,839
But not through your mental projections, not
through your understanding you can understand

175
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,550
the miracles of God; you cannot.

176
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,170
Must understand very humbly that we have to
go beyond, we have to become the spirit.

177
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,329
As Krishna has said, Atman Nivatman Atushda.

178
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:00,639
That is: through atma only the atma will know.

179
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,939
That is: the spirit will know itself through
the spirit.

180
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,839
Is a simple thing to be understood that we
are not yet the spirit, and we have to become

181
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,839
the spirit.

182
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,769
That’s what Christ has clearly said it.

183
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:16,790
Because people did not become the spirit,
now they are challenging Him.

184
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,970
They are challenging His miracles.

185
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,759
To see His miracles, one thing is that you
have to be the spirit.

186
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,000
Now all that is within you, in your own power.

187
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,410
It’s all there, you have to just get it
awakened, and you become that.

188
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,839
Once you become the spirit, you become the
light and then you can give realization to

189
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,839
other people.

190
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:44,139
Now the people when they are skeptical, and
they start doubting, I think there is nothing

191
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,139
to doubt.

192
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,799
You are doubting yourself.

193
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,600
Because, you are not to pay anything here.

194
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,670
You are not to do anything but to get your
realization, that’s all, very simple.

195
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,180
Why should you doubt?

196
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:08,750
Because your brain is such that you doubt
the right and never the wrong.

197
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:16,160
So please tell your mind that just now wait
for a while, let me become the spirit.

198
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,510
Then the same mind, you’ll be surprised,
the same mind will communicate to you, what

199
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,059
you have achieved and what you have got.

200
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:34,250
But as a result of spiritual ascent what do
you get, that’s the main point is, what

201
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,740
should happen to us?

202
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:42,799
So the first thing happens to us is that we
become, again I say you become on your central

203
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,309
nervous system, collectively conscious.

204
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:53,760
That is on your fingertips you can feel the
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

205
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:02,250
You can feel the centers of another person,
on your fingertips you can feel it.

206
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:09,270
You can know about your own centers, you can
know about the center of others.

207
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,340
That is one thing that happens to you, that
you become collectively conscious.

208
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,120
I say you become, it’s no certificate by
anybody else, but you yourself can find out

209
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:33,549
that a new awareness has come on your chakras
and you can feel it.

210
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:42,740
That you can feel what’s wrong, particularly,
in a particular place within your being, also

211
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,260
you know how to cure it, how to put it right,
how to make all right.

212
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:54,880
This is the first thing you get as a knowledge
of collective consciousness.

213
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:04,310
Your attention becomes enlightened because
you become aware of yourself and of others.

214
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:11,320
Now this awareness is very good word in English
language if you understand.

215
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,730
Human beings are much more aware than the
animals.

216
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,730
Where?

217
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,330
On the central nervous system.

218
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,000
Whatever we have achieved in our evolution
is on the central nervous system.

219
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,260
So whatever has to happen to you has to be
on the central nervous system, so that you

220
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,360
achieve the epitome of your evolution.

221
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:39,450
From amoeba you have become the human being
and now you have to become the higher being,

222
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:47,760
not a frog or an earthworm, but a higher being
who can feel another personality and your

223
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,269
own personality.

224
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:53,429
And then you have to know how to cure it.

225
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,600
What I do is nothing, is just like a light,
which is enlightened, can enlighten another

226
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
light, that’s all.

227
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,720
You are all ready and the another light gets
enlightened.

228
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,400
So your ego should not feel challenged at
all.

229
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:14,299
There should be no fear that you are obliged
to Me or there is some obligation on you,

230
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,769
nothing of the kind.

231
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:22,580
This is the first thing happens to you, then
the second thing happens that you become aware

232
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,950
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

233
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,850
Because you start feeling another person within
you.

234
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:38,130
You start understanding another person within
you, not mentally, but on your vibrations.

235
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:46,500
So you understand which part of your being
is not all right and which part is all right.

236
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,590
For example, if somebody gets cured through
Sahaja Yoga and he tries to thank Me for that,

237
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,090
or thank anyone for that, there’s nothing
to thank.

238
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,230
Because who is the other?

239
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:06,659
Supposing this hand is feeling the pain, the
another hand soothes it like that, it’s

240
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:09,130
doing no obligation on this hand.

241
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,320
It’s happening automatically because there
is nobody who is the other.

242
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,309
So this is the second thing happens to you,
that you feel conscious, aware that you are

243
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:25,260
part and parcel of the whole.

244
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,679
Then you know the truth, what is the truth?

245
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:39,090
The truth is that you are the light, that
you are the spirit.

246
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:45,559
Now many people see the light and they say
we have seen the light now we have become

247
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,570
the light.

248
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,271
If you become the light do you see the light?

249
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:52,830
You see the light when you are away from the
light.

250
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,590
If you see the light, then it is not that
you have become the light, but you are seeing

251
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,880
the light, that means it is away from you.

252
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,519
So we must have a full idea as to what is
the light within ourselves.

253
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,519
When we have light within ourselves we see
ourselves clearly and others clearly.

254
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,970
And understand ourselves and understand others.

255
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:20,399
And in that light, if you have the knowledge
how to cure, how to improve, how to cleanse

256
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:24,049
yourself and others then you are the light.

257
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,389
And that’s what exactly happens to you.

258
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:39,960
Then the spirit is the source of compassion
and you become extremely compassionate and

259
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,090
discreet, because you know which person is
all right, which person is not all right.

260
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,799
For example a person is there who may be a
thug, he is cheating, and he says, “I am

261
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,000
a great saint.”

262
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,590
How are you to find out?

263
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,919
Only through vibrations, because you become
like a computer which is connected.

264
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,980
If the computer is not connected then it cannot
say, it is indiscreet, but once it is connected,

265
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,250
all the programming is done in you, you start
working it out and you know exactly what that

266
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,510
sort of a person is.

267
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,720
As soon as you know that person, you know
what should be done about it.

268
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,059
Even if the person is dead, even if he is
far away you can find out about that person

269
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:34,809
and also if he is a great saint, a great personality,
you enjoy it.

270
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:40,020
Even you enjoy the people who are around you,
whom you have missed, you never knew about

271
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
them.

272
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,130
So that first time the rapport is established
between human beings of a very pure nature.

273
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,460
Normally there is some lust, some greed, some
sort of a relationship that exists.

274
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,059
Here is a pure relationship of enjoyment,
every human being is a source of joy when

275
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,740
he becomes the spirit.

276
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,059
As soon as he becomes the spirit you start
enjoying him as a spirit and he also enjoys

277
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,610
you as a pure spirit.

278
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,710
There is no lust, no greed, nothing of the
kind.

279
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,779
Nothing common, like two drunkards are great
friendly people, one of them gives up alcohol

280
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,750
then there is no friendship.

281
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,160
Two nations will say we are brothers, brothers,
and when it comes to reality you’ll find

282
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,250
they are the ones fighting with each other.

283
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:32,710
It can happen to two own brothers, born of
the same parents, it can happen to anyone.

284
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:43,149
But once you born of your spirit, you feel
the oneness that all cells belong to one great

285
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,149
being.

286
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:50,649
Microcosm becomes the macrocosm and you do
not feel that separateness from another personality

287
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:56,790
as you all the time feel you have fear, you
have apprehensions, you are bothered.

288
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:03,929
But once you become that you trust and you
know that another one is a great human being.

289
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:08,340
Only the human beings are the ones who have
created atomic bombs to kill each other.

290
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,409
No animals have done like this.

291
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,980
Only the human beings have a great capacity
to destroy each other.

292
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:21,519
But all these ideas of destruction of others
goes away and you think of constructing everyone

293
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:26,740
into a beautiful way, without aggressing anyone,
without torturing anybody, without trying

294
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,880
to show off.

295
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,210
It’s just automatically works out and this
compassion is the compassion which doesn’t

296
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,210
talk.

297
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,150
It’s a silent compassion which emits from
such a personality and when it emits, it acts,

298
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,500
it works, it doesn’t talk.

299
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:53,510
Such a person, even with a glance, can make
a person peaceful, can bring joy to that person,

300
00:25:53,510 --> 00:26:02,009
can reconcile many broken hearts, can do wonders,
can cure lepers, can cure people suffering

301
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:04,370
from horrible diseases.

302
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:11,799
Because joy, which we talk of, has got its
own powers and one of the greatest powers

303
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:17,470
of joy is that it is the truth and it is the
compassion.

304
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,659
Is the absolute, it is the absolute and that’s
how you do not have any more confusions in

305
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:30,299
your minds because the relative world disappears
and everything gets related to the absolute

306
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,710
that is your spirit.

307
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,190
And this is what you are.

308
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,629
You are the spirit.

309
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:40,019
Only thing you have to just become and that
becoming is a very easy thing that should

310
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:42,899
happen to you.

311
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:46,690
Some people must have read some books where
they must have heard that it’s not such

312
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,409
a easy thing.

313
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:56,259
You have to do lots of cleansing yourself
and you have to go to Himalayas or some sort

314
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:59,039
of a Gobi desert to take your mokshas.

315
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,620
In any case, if you go to Himalayas or to
Gobi desert you get your mokshas all right.

316
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,769
There is nothing to try anymore.

317
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:14,460
But, it is that whatever is vital, you have
to get it easily.

318
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:24,320
You breathe so easily, you digest your food
so easily, you don’t have to go to a guru

319
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,610
or to anyone to get it.

320
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:33,289
So whatever is vital has to happen easily
and that’s why you have to get it very easily.

321
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:37,049
Now you may say, “Why you are there Mother,
what are you doing there?

322
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,479
If we have to get it why not we get it directly?”

323
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:42,889
You cannot, because it cannot talk.

324
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:48,279
It does not have words and somebody has to
decode it for you.

325
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:55,240
After decoding you must, like scientist, accept
Me just as a hypothesis and then see for yourself

326
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,740
if it is true or not.

327
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,120
You should not just discard it because I am
saying so or you should not accept it because

328
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,090
I am saying so, but as scientist keep your
mind open and see for yourself, if it works

329
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,090
you must accept.

330
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,260
If you are honest you will but if you are
dishonest you will not.

331
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,059
Of course this is not meant for frivolous
people who want to waste away their life,

332
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,280
who want to go towards destruction.

333
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,950
God is not going to fall at their feet.

334
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,429
He selects, in a way He does select, and you
yourself were into this selection.

335
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,440
You yourself are found out in this selection.

336
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,430
So it is for you to understand that it is
meant for true seekers, seekers of truth who

337
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,080
are really seeking God and not for people
who are just doing it out of fashion.

338
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,750
I used to get some people because they couldn’t
get admission into some other lecture so they

339
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,879
would come to Me.

340
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:59,929
But some of them would get realization, despite
that, just by chance also they got realization.

341
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:06,629
But such people are not serious people, they
do not develop their realization further and

342
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:08,130
they end up with some problems.

343
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:13,279
And after one year they’ll appear saying
that I have got this problem and that problem.

344
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,669
But this is a science of complete understanding
of the divine laws, how they work out, and

345
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:23,769
once you know that you’ll become a master,
master of yourself.

346
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:30,399
So this source of joy, which is the spirit,
must be achieved and must be enjoyed.

347
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,450
If we do not become that, we have missed the
real point.

348
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,960
That’s what it is.

349
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:42,429
Now there are many people who also come down
with new ideas, this is so, that is so, but

350
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,460
one should understand that why do you want
represent anyone here.

351
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,490
Why don’t you become yourself?

352
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,200
You need not represent some other cult, some
other gurus, better be yourself.

353
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,920
What have you got so far?

354
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:00,659
It just takes a second for you to get realization,
what is the need for you to represent some

355
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:06,710
other people because you have paid some money
there or because you are member of some organization.

356
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,139
You cannot be a member of Sahaja Yoga, you
have to become.

357
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:16,970
First you have to become a person with thoughtless
awareness, which we call in Sanskrit Nirvichar

358
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:23,440
Samadhi, and after that you become a person
endowed with doubtless awareness, which we

359
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,700
call as Nirvichar Samadhi This must be achieved,
otherwise no use coming to Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:38,809
Because we do not want just majority, nobody
is fighting elections here, it is for your

361
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:39,809
gain.

362
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:46,590
If you do not want to achieve that state,
no use being here because it’s just a waste

363
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,870
of time for us and for you.

364
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,309
You should just understand that this is your
right to have it, you must get it and you

365
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:56,080
must learn how to preserve it.

366
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,009
And then you have to give it to others.

367
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,499
You have to use it for helping others.

368
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:06,990
For the emancipation of the whole humanity,
for the saving of the whole humanity.

369
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:12,080
There may be very few, doesn’t matter, but
they have to be genuine and truthful people.

370
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,259
If you are interested in money, by getting
some money in Sahaja Yoga, there are some

371
00:31:17,259 --> 00:31:21,080
people before they came in Sahaja Yoga, wanted
to make money out of it.

372
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,960
Then we found some people who were having
power games.

373
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,370
All this is not going to help.

374
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:33,080
What is going to help us is our genuine effort
to know the truth, that’s all.

375
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,980
Otherwise all other things are of no avail
and no help to us or to you.

376
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:47,440
That’s the only thing that we expect you
to have, is a genuine understanding that it

377
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,929
is what you have which we have to give you,
and which you have to take it, and then give

378
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,110
it to others, what they have.

379
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:01,950
Is a very simple thing, like one light can
enlighten many lights and all those many lights

380
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,470
can enlighten innumerable lights.

381
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:10,730
And the time has come and there is no need
to waste any more time about it.

382
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:14,860
I hope today again we’ll have many people
get their realization.

383
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,600
But you should not get lost.

384
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,039
After getting realization people get lost,
and I think Christ has already described a

385
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:30,010
parable where some seeds got sprouted and
got lost.

386
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,860
So that sort of a thing should not happen,
we should have the seeds which become the

387
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
trees.

388
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,360
And you can, you are quite capable of it because
you have been seekers of ages, not of today.

389
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,279
So you must utilize what you have had today.

390
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,879
You must cash it, it’s your own, and as
your Mother I’m very anxious that I better

391
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:57,550
deliver the goods to the right people, whatever
belongs to you I must give you.

392
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:04,850
That’s how I’m traveling, today only I
came from Austria and I will be again going

393
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,850
to Italy.

394
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,249
And I find in Italy specially people are extremely
sensitive, extremely sensitive.

395
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:18,049
The municipality itself has come forward to
help us and they are the ones who are paying

396
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:20,889
for all our halls and for our advertisement.

397
00:33:20,889 --> 00:33:24,659
I don’t know that is possible in English
municipality.

398
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,320
I don’t know if they’ll have that much
of awareness here.

399
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,879
But doesn’t matter, let’s hope for the
best, doesn’t matter.

400
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:36,730
Whatever it is we, I think if you all people
get your realization and establish it I am

401
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:42,799
sure one day will come that we’ll have to
make this great country into Jerusalem.

402
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:51,830
Is already prescribed by William Blake, and
He must have seen the future of England as

403
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:58,039
something great, that’s why He wrote it,
because He was a very great seer.

404
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:02,889
And we have lots of proof of that, that He
was a great seer and whatever He has said

405
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:04,450
has become the truth.

406
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:11,550
I’ve been here in England for the last eleven
years now, and maybe some more years I may

407
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,610
be here, but then I have to go back to India.

408
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,850
Before that I hope in England we’ll be able
to establish something really substantial.

409
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,400
May God bless you all.

410
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,290
The question part we have decided not to have
because it wastes your time, but if you have

411
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,170
any questions you can write to Me, and I’ll
answer them.

412
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:39,480
That is much better because mostly these are
individual questions, nothing collective,

413
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,350
so is better not to disturb everyone by questions.

414
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:49,600
If you have any problems you may write to
Me, you have got address, and I’ll definitely

415
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,920
answer you, and I’ll try to do whatever
is possible.

416
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:05,130
Thank you.

417
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:20,560
Now we will have the experience, which is
a very simple thing; but we are not very simple,

418
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,370
we are quite complicated.

419
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,970
So in a simple place, like I went to Himalayas,
the foothills of Himalayas.

420
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:35,040
Very simple people from the village came,
and it was said that they call the Kundalini

421
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,070
as the Devi, is the Goddess: “the Goddess
will be awakened.”

422
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:44,660
They came from twenty miles walking down,
and in a valley we had a program, and thousands

423
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
were there.

424
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,550
And they all got realization, and they got
established, I didn’t have to do much about

425
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,550
them.

426
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,260
Very simple people.

427
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,430
And traditionally they know what it is, waiting
for this day.

428
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,910
So, because we are little complicated we have
to help ourselves.

429
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,130
And so it might take little more time, doesn’t
matter, we must have patience with ourselves.

430
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:14,500
For this experience I have to say that those
who do not want to do it should go away, because

431
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,780
they shouldn’t disturb others.

432
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:21,160
To be civil and kind to others should go away,
and should not suddenly get up and walk out,

433
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,130
or suddenly open your eyes.

434
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,080
If you want to go away, you can go away.

435
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:45,359
But if you want to stay you are welcome to
stay, but you have to do the way we tell you,

436
00:36:45,359 --> 00:37:06,010
because it cannot be forced upon you.

437
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:20,550
Now, you will all have to close your eyes,
so you need not have your spectacles, because

438
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,270
it also helps your eyesight.

439
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:29,320
And you have to take out your shoes, because
this Mother Earth helps us a lot to suck out

440
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,240
our problems due to the matter.

441
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:40,150
Best is to take out your spectacles, because
your eyesight improves.

442
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,990
Many a times it does help.

443
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,960
And moreover, the attention has to be withdrawn
inside.

444
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,060
But if your eyes are open then the attention
goes out.

445
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:59,170
So, best thing is to take out your shoes and
your spectacles, and any sort of a tight thing

446
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:05,940
which makes you, I would say, little uncomfortable.

447
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:15,370
Anything tight anywhere which makes you uncomfortable
should be loosened, that’s all.

448
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:20,530
Both the feet should be on the Mother Earth
straight, like that.

449
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:24,330
In case you are sitting on the ground it’s
all right, but if you are not sitting on the

450
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:30,680
ground, the best thing is to put both the
feet on the Mother Earth.

451
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,110
And the shoes, please keep them at the back,
would be better than to keep it on the sides.

452
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,110
At the back.

453
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,270
You should not touch them.

454
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:44,620
And now put your feet away from each other
a little bit, parallel on the ground.

455
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:54,370
At the very outset I have to say that we have
to be very pleasantly placed within ourselves,

456
00:38:54,370 --> 00:39:00,060
because we are going to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

457
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,950
So, we should be very pleasant about it, and
we should forgive ourselves.

458
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:13,700
We should not have guilt of any kind, of any
kind whatsoever.

459
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,440
This is one of the biggest obstacles of the
West, that everybody has some sort of a nonsensical

460
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,680
thing called guilt, which I do not understand.

461
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,930
Even for a small thing we build up a guilt,
because the norms are so strong here that

462
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:35,970
people who do not do some small thing like
wearing a proper shoe also feels guilty.

463
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,720
It’s very absurd to feel guilty.

464
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,130
When you are a human being, that means God
has accepted you, chosen you to be a higher

465
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,130
personality.

466
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,600
So you should not have any guilt at all.

467
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:58,340
Apart from that, Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,
and you cannot commit mistakes in such a way

468
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,460
that Divine cannot forgive.

469
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:09,060
So please first of all forgive yourself, have
respect yourself, because you are the temple

470
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,650
of God.

471
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,790
Only the light has to be brought in, that’s
all.

472
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,120
So you must have respect for yourself.

473
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:27,050
Now, the left hand is the power of your desire,
and kundalini is the power of pure desire.

474
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:31,160
So you put your desire on your hand like this
towards Me.

475
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:41,430
That is the expression that you are desiring
to have your realization, all the time.

476
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:52,190
And the right hand has to be put on different
centers to help the kundalini to settle herself

477
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,490
properly in these centers, and to rise.

478
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,090
And this, you have to do it.

479
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,830
You have to raise your own kundalini.

480
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,560
I’ll just tell you how it is done, is very
simple, where to put which hand.

481
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:08,520
Now, in the beginning you just keep your eyes
open and see that on the heart first, I’ll

482
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,800
tell you later on, just now see, that on the
heart, then on the upper part of the abdomen,

483
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,810
then on the lower part of the abdomen, then
going back in the upper part of the abdomen,

484
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,410
then on your heart again.

485
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,980
I will tell you one by one, everything.

486
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,600
And then here, this is the center which catches
very much when you feel guilty.

487
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,730
And it’s still very bad today.

488
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,850
So just here, at the back.

489
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,820
From the front you have to take the hand and
put it on the left-hand side like this, between

490
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:44,230
the angle of the neck and the shoulder, and
just press it a little bit behind like that.

491
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,070
This is very important center.

492
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:51,370
And this is how I find people get spondylitis
and angina, all kinds of diseases; because

493
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,370
they feel guilty all the time.

494
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,370
There’s nothing to feel guilty.

495
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:59,720
Then you have to put your hand here, this
is the center of Christ, and another one,

496
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,780
here at back.

497
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,450
And then you have to stretch your hand and
put this center of your hand on top of your

498
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:12,490
head, here on the fontanel bone area which
we call as the Brahmarandra, and press it

499
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,490
hard.

500
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,110
And move it clockwise like this, seven times.

501
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:22,930
So this all we will be doing after closing
our eyes, which is a simple thing; only people

502
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,160
make mistakes when they do not put their hands
this way but this way, and it pains, so best

503
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,620
is to do it in this manner.

504
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:35,640
Now, all these centers we are trying on the
left-hand side, that one should remember;

505
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,120
not on the right-hand side.

506
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:43,220
Every center I’ll describe to you, and I’m
sure we’ll all achieve our realization.

507
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,430
Now, the left hand towards Me and both the
feet on the ground.

508
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,430
You shouldn’t watch others.

509
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,850
This is the first time you are going to see
yourself, so don’t watch anybody else, only

510
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,020
you have to watch yourself within.

511
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,110
And please don’t open your eyes.

512
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,230
Keep your eyes shut till I tell you.

513
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:09,260
Now, the right hand has to go on the heart.

514
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:16,570
Now, here resides the spirit.

515
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,510
You have to now ask Me a very fundamental
question.

516
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:27,100
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can
call Me “Mother,” whatever you like.

517
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,420
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

518
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:49,720
Ask this fundamental question with full confidence
in yourself.

519
00:43:49,720 --> 00:44:03,300
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

520
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,300
Three times.

521
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:10,570
Now after this a very fundamental question
again follows, just after this, that if you

522
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,470
are the spirit, you are your own master.

523
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:27,400
So you put your hand please on the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

524
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:37,010
Here, you again ask Me a question three times,
“Mother, am I my own master?

525
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,750
Mother, am I my own guide?

526
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:45,640
Mother, am I my own guru?”

527
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:53,980
Three times.

528
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:19,270
Now, please take this hand in the lower part
of the abdomen on the left-hand side, and

529
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:25,040
press it hard a little with your fingers.

530
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,190
Lower part of the abdomen, lower part.

531
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:39,780
Now, this is a center of the true knowledge
of the Divine, the laws of the Divine, the

532
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,360
technique of the Divine.

533
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,820
The pure knowledge resides in this center.

534
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:59,050
Now, I cannot force you to ask this knowledge,
so I would request you to say that you want

535
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,050
this knowledge.

536
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:08,730
So please say, “Mother, may I have the pure
knowledge, the true knowledge?”

537
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:15,540
You have to say this six times, because this
center has got six petals.

538
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,840
Six times.

539
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:30,810
“May I have the true knowledge, may I have
the pure knowledge?”

540
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:54,080
This will excite the kundalini.

541
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:11,670
Now raise your right hand on the upper part
of the abdomen on the left-hand side, press

542
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,060
hard.

543
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:27,860
Here again, this being the center of a master,
a Guru Principle center which is created by

544
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:37,100
all the great masters of the world, you have
to assert, to make a seat for the kundalini

545
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,040
to rise.

546
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:47,720
With full confidence in yourself, you have
to say, “Mother, I am my own master.

547
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:54,160
Mother, I am my own guru,” ten times.

548
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,770
“Mother, I am my own guide.”

549
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:09,750
Ten times, because there are ten principles
of the mastery.

550
00:48:09,750 --> 00:49:17,330
Now, please raise your hand to your heart
and press it there, on the heart.

551
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,410
Here resides the spirit.

552
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:26,151
The truth is, you are the spirit.

553
00:49:26,151 --> 00:49:29,740
So now you have to assert again, twelve times.

554
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:32,940
There are the twelve petals here.

555
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,500
Twelve times you have to say, “Mother, I
am the spirit.”

556
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,950
Have confidence in yourself.

557
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,320
Please say it.

558
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,680
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

559
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,240
Believe in yourself.

560
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,609
Have faith in yourself.

561
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:58,780
You are the spirit.

562
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:24,050
Now please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and the shoulder, on the left-hand

563
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:33,410
side, and take it little backward and hold
it tight.

564
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:41,160
Here is the center which goes into problem
when you feel guilty.

565
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:52,250
So please say sixteen times, “Mother, I
am not guilty at all.”

566
00:50:52,250 --> 00:51:01,900
Divine is the ocean of love, peace, graciousness,
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

567
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:12,340
So please say it sixteen times, with full
confidence that you are not guilty at all,

568
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,920
“Mother, I am not guilty at all for anything.”

569
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,940
Forget the past.

570
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,960
Forget the past.

571
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,940
Be in the present.

572
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:41,200
Close your eyes in a way that there’s no
pressure on the eyes, close them fully.

573
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,440
Sixteen times.

574
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,100
If you still, if you still feel that you are
guilty, you better punish yourself by saying

575
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,630
it hundred-and-eight times.

576
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:58,240
That would be better then, for some people
who just indulge into this kind of a pastime

577
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,850
for nothing at all.

578
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:30,300
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

579
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:58,340
Now, please put your right hand on your forehead
across, and press it on both the sides.

580
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:08,050
Here you have to say – how many times is
not the point.

581
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:12,480
Here you have to say from your heart, “Mother,
I forgive everyone.

582
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,520
Mother, I forgive everyone.”

583
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,310
From your heart.

584
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:26,380
Those who say it is difficult to say are under
wrong impression, because it’s a myth.

585
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:32,220
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, it’s
a myth.

586
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,750
On your forehead, please.

587
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,570
Not on your head, but on your forehead.

588
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:38,920
On your forehead.

589
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:46,590
From your heart, please say, “Mother, I
forgive everyone.”

590
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:52,940
Because if you don’t forgive you are playing
into the hands of wrong people.

591
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:00,270
It’s a myth, in any case.

592
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:05,490
Now, take this hand on the back of your head.

593
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:12,650
Just for your satisfaction you may say that
“If I have done any mistakes, oh Divine,

594
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,890
please forgive me.”

595
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:25,850
Just for your satisfaction you should say
that, because the Divine has already forgiven

596
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,010
you.

597
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:36,101
Now, please stretch your hand and put your
palm on the fontanel bone area which is a

598
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:42,240
soft bone in your childhood, and press it
hard and move it seven times.

599
00:54:42,240 --> 00:55:16,520
Press it hard; the center part you press it
hard, the center part.

600
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:35,450
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

601
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:41,870
Now slowly take down your hand, and slowly
open your eyes.

602
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,270
Now, without thinking, you have to watch Me;
just without thinking.

603
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,670
You can do it.

604
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,670
Without thinking.

605
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:47,780
There’s no thought.

606
00:55:47,780 --> 00:56:01,130
Now you may put on your glasses if you want
to, and without thinking you put your right

607
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:07,400
hand like this, little higher, and with the
left hand just try to see if there’s a cool

608
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,150
breeze coming out – with the left hand.

609
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:15,240
It’s very subtle, it’s sukshma; with the
left hand.

610
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,130
Put your right hand like this, please.

611
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:25,030
It’s very, very subtle, very subtle.

612
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,550
Little higher.

613
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,390
Maybe about four inches, five inches.

614
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:31,470
Here.

615
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,560
Hmm.

616
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:40,260
Now, put the right hand on top again, left
hand towards Me.

617
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,850
There’ll be some heat coming out, doesn’t
matter.

618
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:49,000
Let it come out.

619
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,080
Is here.

620
00:56:51,080 --> 00:57:01,520
There’s no thought in your mind, you can
see there’s no thought.

621
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:07,760
Now raise both the hands and push back your
head, and ask a question, “Is this the cool

622
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,760
breeze of the Holy Ghost?

623
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,650
Is this the all-pervading Power of God?

624
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,000
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

625
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Ask the question.

626
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,150
“Is this the Power that does all living
work?”

627
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,150
Just push back your head and ask.

628
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,150
Now, put down your hands.

629
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:34,390
See if you feel it in your hands.

630
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:45,370
Like this, like this.

631
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:51,460
Opening out.

632
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,500
There.

633
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:00,360
And you are relaxed.

634
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:06,520
There’s a peace that is emitted.

635
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,470
All right?

636
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:23,580
Keep the neck straight.

637
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:37,680
Straight neck.

638
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,910
One more thing I would like to tell you – how
to raise your own kundalini.

639
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:48,920
Because this is the only program we are having
here, so I’m sorry I have to tell you all

640
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,200
in one program.

641
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:53,440
But you all have to come to our centers.

642
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,640
We have them in every corner of England and
also in London, where you can meet people

643
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,710
and find out more about it, and master it.

644
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:06,150
That’s what you have to do, on the follow-on.

645
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,920
You must come and pay attention fully to it.

646
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,440
It’s not only when I come that you should
come.

647
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,380
They are all here who have known about it,
and they will just guide you.

648
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,520
They are not going to dominate you, they are
just here to guide you; and once you know,

649
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,420
when you become masters, then you can do the
same.

650
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,400
Because I’m alone, and how many people can
I meet?

651
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,460
I have to travel, I have to go in other countries
also.

652
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:39,600
So, there are people who are quite equipped,
and they will tell you all about it in a very

653
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
sensible way.

654
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:46,520
Just listen to them and they will guide you,
and you will reach your destination very soon.

655
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,490
You need hardly a month to understand it,
hardly a month.

656
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:58,390
Now, how to get yourself into a complete protection.

657
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,800
You have to give protection to your aura.

658
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:07,260
So for that you have to raise your hand from
this to this, like that, seven times.

659
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:12,110
Let’s do it.

660
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:29,810
One, two, three – this is a protection to
our aura – four, five, six and seven.

661
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:42,211
Now to raise your kundalini, put your hand
while sitting down, in front of you just like

662
01:00:42,211 --> 01:00:43,270
this.

663
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:45,410
In front.

664
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:50,380
And the movement of the left hand should be
straight like that, watching the hand, and

665
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,150
the right hand should be upward, forward,
downward, backward.

666
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:00,200
It’s very simple, like that, clockwise and
this hand should move straight till you reach

667
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,200
the head.

668
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,600
I’ll tell you how.

669
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,610
Now, let’s start.

670
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,610
It’s very simple.

671
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:11,620
Even a child can do it.

672
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:19,630
Push back your head, loosen your shoulders
and give it a twist.

673
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,380
And now tie it up.

674
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,630
Let’s do it again.

675
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:24,630
Three times.

676
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:25,630
See now it’s moving faster.

677
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,630
Push back your head.

678
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,630
Now.

679
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,630
The kundalini moves with it.

680
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,630
Now, this is what the Christ’s disciples
did, and people didn’t understand.

681
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:33,380
And let’s have it once more and this time
three knots are needed on your head, so you

682
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:44,020
fix up the kundalini on top of your head.

683
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:57,780
One, two and the three.

684
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,810
Now, you feel it in your hands.

685
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:02,810
See now the ….

686
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:03,810
The face changes.

687
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,810
Eyes start glistening.

688
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:05,810
A different glint comes in, and that’s how
you know you are a realized soul; and that’s

689
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,810
how you know you are My children.

690
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,660
But you have to establish it.

691
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:16,650
You have to establish the experience.

692
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,890
Even those who haven’t got it, doesn’t
matter.

693
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:25,610
Everyone can get it and you have to establish
it, and for establishing luckily today it’s

694
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:31,680
very easy, because we have here so many people
who can tell you all about it.

695
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:38,210
They have understood it fully, they know it,
they know everything and they will tell you

696
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:39,310
all about it.

697
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,520
There’s no secret in Sahaja Yoga.

698
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,730
Everything is going to be told to you.

699
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,960
May God bless you.

700
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,520
How many of you have felt the cool breeze
on the head and as well as in the hands?

701
01:02:54,520 --> 01:03:00,470
If you have felt on the hands or in the head,
please raise both your hands.

702
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:02,600
Both your hands.

703
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,470
All of you felt it!

704
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:11,020
Except for very few, all of you have felt.

705
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:17,910
Those of you who haven’t felt it shouldn’t
mind, it will all work out.

706
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:22,480
There are people who can help you out.

707
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,480
Thank you very much.

708
01:03:23,480 --> 01:04:00,900
May God give you wisdom and strength to establish
yourself as great yogis.
