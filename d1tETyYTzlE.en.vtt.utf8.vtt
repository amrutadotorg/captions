WEBVTT

00:07.480 --> 00:12.809
today we have assembled here

00:13.200 --> 00:18.200
to a sheep say Ganesha

00:20.980 --> 00:27.990
Shri Ganesha who is the lord of

00:25.150 --> 00:27.990
innocence

00:32.830 --> 00:56.710
he is the ocean of analysis and though

00:42.770 --> 01:06.610
he is such a young little boy he can

00:56.710 --> 01:13.150
fight the whole world he can destroy all

01:06.610 --> 01:16.150
the negatory that's the sign of

01:13.150 --> 01:16.150
innocence

01:19.550 --> 01:26.890
there have been stories that children

01:23.330 --> 01:31.960
who have fallen from very early tide

01:26.890 --> 01:31.960
they are completely saved nothing about

01:33.340 --> 01:49.010
their innocence it's such a powerful

01:39.890 --> 01:55.550
thing that it doesn't harm anyone who is

01:49.010 --> 01:59.600
not to be harmed it has all the wisdom

01:55.550 --> 02:07.790
of the world all the understanding of

01:59.600 --> 02:14.620
the world and anybody who tries to harm

02:07.790 --> 02:19.340
the innocence the world the whole world

02:14.620 --> 02:23.030
which has made me not have cared so much

02:19.340 --> 02:27.280
for innocence might not have worshipped

02:23.030 --> 02:33.080
innocence so much but they all stand

02:27.280 --> 02:43.280
stand up against anybody who tries to

02:33.080 --> 02:48.950
harm the innocence you can see in your

02:43.280 --> 02:54.440
own lies around you anybody tries to

02:48.950 --> 02:58.239
trouble children all of them whatever

02:54.440 --> 03:02.270
they are whatever they are coming from

02:58.239 --> 03:07.970
whatever may be their nationality they

03:02.270 --> 03:14.840
all jump all jump to control and to

03:07.970 --> 03:18.380
safeguard that Charlie what is it what

03:14.840 --> 03:26.620
is it within us that makes us so very

03:18.380 --> 03:26.620
conscious to protect the innocence

03:27.050 --> 03:39.300
it's a really think great shame for us

03:35.060 --> 03:46.250
when we find in this world that

03:39.300 --> 03:46.250
innocence is under attack anything else

03:46.760 --> 03:54.350
can be tolerated innocent people who

03:52.290 --> 04:04.800
have done nothing wrong

03:54.350 --> 04:11.220
those who have no malice who are living

04:04.800 --> 04:18.690
like little children I should say if

04:11.220 --> 04:27.510
they are attacked by you not that the

04:18.690 --> 04:35.930
whole world reacts God but every one of

04:27.510 --> 04:41.460
them cannot bear any innocent person or

04:35.930 --> 04:50.160
innocent being being harmed we don't

04:41.460 --> 04:57.440
realize that within us there is the

04:50.160 --> 05:04.110
ocean of love and ocean of understanding

04:57.440 --> 05:07.320
for children why why should it be why

05:04.110 --> 05:14.040
should we feel like that especially for

05:07.320 --> 05:17.310
children especially for innocence there

05:14.040 --> 05:23.060
are people who are always attacking

05:17.310 --> 05:25.650
innocent people in ascension there are

05:23.060 --> 05:31.060
but

05:25.650 --> 05:35.560
no one wants to support them no one

05:31.060 --> 05:40.410
thinks that's proper to ill-treat

05:35.560 --> 05:44.680
children and those who have done this

05:40.410 --> 05:50.050
have to suffer they all suffer as a

05:44.680 --> 05:52.570
reaction what is it within us that

05:50.050 --> 05:59.169
creates that reaction that tremendous

05:52.570 --> 06:02.889
reaction against innocence for example

05:59.169 --> 06:07.320
if there is a regular war and if there

06:02.889 --> 06:12.160
are people fighting in a regular war

06:07.320 --> 06:15.460
they don't have much sympathy in the

06:12.160 --> 06:17.979
world also they say all right we're of

06:15.460 --> 06:21.009
that understanding they are of that kind

06:17.979 --> 06:28.000
of thing the greatest sympathy comes

06:21.009 --> 06:31.240
when innocent is being cherished that's

06:28.000 --> 06:35.620
what human beings have within themselves

06:31.240 --> 06:43.560
they have the power power of Shri

06:35.620 --> 06:50.430
Ganesha nature gives you that feeling

06:43.560 --> 06:56.620
that capacity that understanding that

06:50.430 --> 07:01.750
you have to protect innocent innocent

06:56.620 --> 07:05.590
children innocent people and the whole

07:01.750 --> 07:10.050
world can rise against all such people

07:05.590 --> 07:18.659
who are trying to kill the innocent

07:10.050 --> 07:24.340
there cannot be any doubt if they cannot

07:18.659 --> 07:27.849
oppose such an attack or criticize such

07:24.340 --> 07:31.080
a thing then they are not yet human

07:27.849 --> 07:31.080
beings I would say

07:31.800 --> 07:45.980
the highest personality can sacrifice

07:38.790 --> 07:50.070
anything and can give up anything but

07:45.980 --> 07:52.820
they cannot give up the feeling they

07:50.070 --> 07:56.700
have her innocence

07:52.820 --> 08:02.060
it is very remarkable we don't realize

07:56.700 --> 08:07.640
how much there is this ocean of

08:02.060 --> 08:12.830
protection and love for the innocent

08:07.640 --> 08:19.920
what attracts the greatest strength is

08:12.830 --> 08:24.390
when we see an innocent person innocent

08:19.920 --> 08:29.250
children are under attack that's the

08:24.390 --> 08:31.400
beauty of human beings of course there

08:29.250 --> 08:34.170
are many human beings who can be cruel

08:31.400 --> 08:38.640
who are I would say I call them devils

08:34.170 --> 08:45.540
maybe maybe but when it comes to

08:38.640 --> 08:54.690
children and to innocent people everyone

08:45.540 --> 08:58.340
feels is a responsibility it's difficult

08:54.690 --> 09:05.540
for normal human beings to be innocent

08:58.340 --> 09:11.060
because they have kind of a

09:05.540 --> 09:13.040
understanding that they are something

09:11.060 --> 09:16.519
great

09:13.040 --> 09:19.790
that they understand everything that

09:16.519 --> 09:22.810
they can analyze everything and they

09:19.790 --> 09:27.050
could be crooks they could be aggressive

09:22.810 --> 09:30.529
they could be troublesome they could be

09:27.050 --> 09:35.899
anything and they can give explanation

09:30.529 --> 09:40.190
for that in math but still on the whole

09:35.899 --> 09:46.819
they can never be respected and they can

09:40.190 --> 09:50.959
never be honored for the thing that for

09:46.819 --> 09:55.699
us the sahaja Yogi's the search culture

09:50.959 --> 09:58.519
is to respect your innocence you might

09:55.699 --> 10:02.600
feel a little bit cheated you might feel

09:58.519 --> 10:07.310
a little bit dominated we might feel it

10:02.600 --> 10:10.759
to be disgraced but sahaja Yogi's I have

10:07.310 --> 10:14.959
to be innocent because with them lies

10:10.759 --> 10:20.649
the power of Shri Ganesha they should

10:14.959 --> 10:28.029
not feel dejected if they are being used

10:20.649 --> 10:31.910
insulted tortured dominated for Allah

10:28.029 --> 10:37.540
they should not try to destroy the

10:31.910 --> 10:37.540
innocence of other people of anyone

10:37.810 --> 10:48.430
automatically it will work will be

10:41.029 --> 10:53.120
amazed that when innocence is charged

10:48.430 --> 10:57.350
all the goodness of the world comes to

10:53.120 --> 11:02.980
the rescue of that example of this is

10:57.350 --> 11:06.740
the recent war so-called war of America

11:02.980 --> 11:08.290
where innocent people they have done

11:06.740 --> 11:14.930
nothing wrong

11:08.290 --> 11:22.580
have been tortured have been killed at

11:14.930 --> 11:27.800
that time all over the world is a big

11:22.580 --> 11:33.170
support worthy every country whether it

11:27.800 --> 11:40.850
believes in those people or not is

11:33.170 --> 11:44.240
anxious to look after those who have

11:40.850 --> 11:47.360
done this crime they may not be

11:44.240 --> 11:49.510
belonging to the same religion they may

11:47.360 --> 11:52.100
not be belonging to the same country

11:49.510 --> 11:58.010
they may not be belonging to the same

11:52.100 --> 12:01.640
crimes but at this moment who does not

11:58.010 --> 12:05.630
take the side of the innocence will be

12:01.640 --> 12:10.220
singled out and will be destroyed no

12:05.630 --> 12:14.029
doubt about once for all they will learn

12:10.220 --> 12:19.790
a lesson that you cannot attack innocent

12:14.029 --> 12:23.149
leader I have told you in sahaja yoga we

12:19.790 --> 12:28.399
should not ever be annoyed with our

12:23.149 --> 12:30.130
children we should not in no way punish

12:28.399 --> 12:38.300
them

12:30.130 --> 12:42.500
our main achievement should be that

12:38.300 --> 12:47.180
loving attention for children all over

12:42.500 --> 12:51.290
the world where he belongs to your

12:47.180 --> 12:54.160
family or to some another family or has

12:51.290 --> 12:54.160
some sort of

12:57.380 --> 13:07.970
detached attention with you still

13:03.570 --> 13:13.560
because he is a child he is innocent

13:07.970 --> 13:19.560
the innocence within itself your own

13:13.560 --> 13:24.090
innocence will try to protect it's very

13:19.560 --> 13:28.950
surprising how people take to

13:24.090 --> 13:35.700
sacrificing their lives when it comes to

13:28.950 --> 13:40.380
the attack of innocence children should

13:35.700 --> 13:43.740
never be attacked they have their own

13:40.380 --> 13:46.620
power to protect no doubt but you

13:43.740 --> 13:54.300
shouldn't waste your energy on something

13:46.620 --> 14:00.710
that is extremely inauspicious extremely

13:54.300 --> 14:00.710
cruel and extremely ugly

14:01.760 --> 14:10.890
if you cannot love children you cannot

14:06.150 --> 14:13.680
love anything else not come across

14:10.890 --> 14:18.330
anyone so far who says that they don't

14:13.680 --> 14:22.950
love to do it luckily but maybe some

14:18.330 --> 14:27.110
might say we love flowers why why you

14:22.950 --> 14:30.450
love flowers because they are innocent

14:27.110 --> 14:34.410
because that beauty of innocence is

14:30.450 --> 14:37.560
within them we love nature why because

14:34.410 --> 14:43.350
it is innocent but the greatest

14:37.560 --> 14:48.110
innocence is seen among human beings who

14:43.350 --> 14:48.110
are sahaja Yogi's
