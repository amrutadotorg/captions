ETVD Unknown TC:BC 13-09-2015

00:34.240 --> 00:43.640
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri G anesha.

00:45.320 --> 00:52.640
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.979
His power comes from his innocence.

00:58.139 --> 01:02.781
When we see small children we are automatically

01:02.941 --> 01:06.400
compelled towards them

01:06.560 --> 01:13.920
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

01:14.080 --> 01:18.840
And very innocent they are,

01:20.120 --> 01:22.440
extremely innocent,

01:22.600 --> 01:28.960
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

01:29.120 --> 01:35.920
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

01:36.120 --> 01:42.800
These days people have become extremely cunning,

01:42.960 --> 01:46.600
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.160
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

01:50.320 --> 01:54.200
who are innocent and simple.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.600
They can justify themselves always

01:57.760 --> 02:02.680
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

02:02.840 --> 02:05.960
when everybody is so cunning.

02:06.120 --> 02:16.200
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

02:16.400 --> 02:19.520
which is very much punishable,

02:19.800 --> 02:25.360
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

02:25.520 --> 02:29.360
which are physical, you can say.

02:29.720 --> 02:37.680
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.880
Also, they can have other troubles

02:42.040 --> 02:45.560
with their liver treatments and all that.

02:45.720 --> 02:51.600
All this comes up. Then to punish them

02:51.760 --> 02:57.280
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.680
At this time, when you have these problems,

03:00.840 --> 03:04.080
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

03:04.240 --> 03:07.120
should worship Shri Ganesha.

03:07.360 --> 03:14.680
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

03:14.840 --> 03:20.160
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

03:20.320 --> 03:24.360
extra work, I should say, than normal.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.080
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

03:29.240 --> 03:33.520
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

03:33.680 --> 03:41.000
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.800
One of the two things come up

03:43.960 --> 03:48.120
and he does not know where he is going.

03:48.280 --> 03:54.320
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

03:54.480 --> 03:58.960
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

03:59.120 --> 04:06.320
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.677
All these diseases of the right side

04:09.837 --> 04:14.240
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

04:14.400 --> 04:20.200
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

04:21.200 --> 04:27.640
but there is a simple way to remember him

04:27.800 --> 04:33.200
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

04:33.360 --> 04:37.120
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

04:37.280 --> 04:42.040
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.880
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.760
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

04:50.920 --> 04:55.600
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

04:55.760 --> 05:00.560
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

05:00.720 --> 05:03.240
and all the worries from you.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.320
So this is the most important deity we have.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.680
Though its a very simple deity.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.360
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.720
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

05:17.880 --> 05:26.400
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

05:26.560 --> 05:33.400
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.280
So to steady down these

05:36.440 --> 05:43.480
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

05:43.720 --> 05:50.680
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

05:50.880 --> 05:55.640
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.800
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

05:59.960 --> 06:04.120
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

06:04.280 --> 06:09.520
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

06:09.680 --> 06:11.640
he never said who it was.

06:11.800 --> 06:16.600
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

06:16.760 --> 06:23.200
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

06:23.360 --> 06:26.080
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

06:26.240 --> 06:28.920
he used to go all out to fight it.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.040
Same is Shri Ganesha.

06:31.200 --> 06:36.120
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

06:36.280 --> 06:41.160
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

06:41.320 --> 06:44.480
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

06:44.640 --> 06:49.320
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.760
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

06:53.920 --> 06:58.520
in different troubles and hurdles and also

06:58.680 --> 07:02.160
different type of very very difficult times.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.760
It is his style that he manages things so well

07:06.920 --> 07:09.600
because he is a Ganapati.

07:09.760 --> 07:15.720
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.480
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

07:20.640 --> 07:28.640
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

07:28.800 --> 07:32.720
who report if there is any problem.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.000
They report to the brain that there is a problem

07:37.160 --> 07:43.800
and on the sternum bone is the residence

07:43.960 --> 07:49.600
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

07:49.760 --> 07:58.600
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

07:58.760 --> 08:02.320
sternum bone starts vibrating

08:02.480 --> 08:08.960
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.120
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

08:13.280 --> 08:18.240
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

08:18.400 --> 08:22.360
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

08:22.520 --> 08:26.480
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

08:26.640 --> 08:29.280
are helped by Ganas is not true.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.760
Also the people who are mentally upset,

08:32.920 --> 08:37.640
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

08:37.800 --> 08:42.920
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

08:43.080 --> 08:48.000
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

08:48.160 --> 08:54.640
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.440
Now his parents start crying for Mother

08:59.600 --> 09:03.560
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

09:03.720 --> 09:07.320
that they immediately rush to that place

09:07.480 --> 09:11.960
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.720
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

09:15.880 --> 09:22.520
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.280
They are also small like him

09:26.440 --> 09:30.040
and they are very active and very alert.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.160
They never sleep.

09:32.320 --> 09:36.360
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

09:36.520 --> 09:41.360
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

09:41.520 --> 09:47.680
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

09:48.440 --> 09:52.080
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.400
For example there was a boy who got drowned

09:56.560 --> 10:02.800
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.880
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

10:05.040 --> 10:07.600
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

10:07.760 --> 10:09.920
because there were children.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.640
So one boy fell down into that

10:12.800 --> 10:16.000
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.120
Nobody knew he was there.

10:18.280 --> 10:23.800
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

10:23.960 --> 10:27.520
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

10:27.680 --> 10:32.480
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.160
After that they got so frightened

10:36.320 --> 10:39.920
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.600
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

10:42.760 --> 10:45.030
I didn’t know even the address.

10:45.190 --> 10:49.600
But I asked to telephone to this number,

10:49.760 --> 10:52.680
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

10:52.840 --> 10:58.440
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

10:58.600 --> 11:01.680
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

11:01.840 --> 11:03.400
and he will be saved.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.560
Nobody had told me anything.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.320
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

11:08.480 --> 11:13.160
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

11:13.320 --> 11:17.200
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

11:17.360 --> 11:19.880
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

11:20.040 --> 11:22.920
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.520
If there is one chance of his surviving,

11:25.680 --> 11:30.600
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

11:30.760 --> 11:33.720
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.800
So, like this, so many things happen

11:35.960 --> 11:41.920
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

11:42.080 --> 11:45.520
your blessings that this has happened.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.520
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

11:48.680 --> 11:51.120
but because of Shri Ganesha.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.760
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

11:53.920 --> 11:57.280
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

11:57.440 --> 12:03.280
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.880
To him his Mother is everything.

12:07.040 --> 12:10.040
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

12:10.200 --> 12:15.720
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

12:15.880 --> 12:23.240
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

12:23.400 --> 12:28.000
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

12:28.160 --> 12:33.560
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

12:33.720 --> 12:36.880
but His work is tremendous.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.760
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

12:41.920 --> 12:47.680
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

12:47.840 --> 12:51.520
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

12:51.680 --> 12:57.800
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

12:57.960 --> 13:02.480
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.080
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.240
Its not only in women but also in men,

13:08.400 --> 13:11.560
he expects chastity to be present.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.920
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

13:17.080 --> 13:20.320
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

13:20.480 --> 13:26.400
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

13:26.560 --> 13:30.720
of communicating with young women and young men

13:30.880 --> 13:33.640
and spoiling your chastity.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.640
Even your eyes should be clean,

13:36.800 --> 13:39.320
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

13:39.480 --> 13:43.400
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

13:43.560 --> 13:46.000
what mistakes you have committed

13:46.160 --> 13:53.000
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

13:53.160 --> 13:58.440
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.960
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.360
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

14:06.520 --> 14:09.160
but that is a very important thing.

14:09.320 --> 14:14.480
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.200
We should be very chaste.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.400
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.200
But religions have become so useless now,

14:24.360 --> 14:27.640
have become without any basis,

14:27.800 --> 14:38.320
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.880
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

14:42.040 --> 14:46.240
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.440
Actually the religions have failed completely

14:49.600 --> 14:54.440
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.720
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

14:56.880 --> 15:00.080
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.760
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

15:03.920 --> 15:10.600
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

15:10.760 --> 15:15.560
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

15:15.720 --> 15:22.320
and where people are also having very bad morals.

15:22.480 --> 15:27.120
He creates problems for them. What happens that

15:27.280 --> 15:34.160
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.704
Earthquake takes place in places where

15:36.864 --> 15:40.520
there is no respect of chastity,

15:40.680 --> 15:44.520
also where there are fundamentalist

15:44.680 --> 15:51.520
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

15:51.680 --> 15:56.440
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.880
So the Mother earth also understands.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.480
Now we have so many earthquakes,

16:02.640 --> 16:04.920
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

16:05.080 --> 16:08.080
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.000
So he protects them.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.880
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

16:15.040 --> 16:17.080
he tries to destroy them,

16:17.240 --> 16:21.200
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

16:21.360 --> 16:32.120
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

16:32.280 --> 16:35.000
he attracts people towards himself,

16:35.160 --> 16:40.000
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.800
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

16:44.960 --> 16:50.480
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

16:50.640 --> 16:53.680
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

16:53.840 --> 16:57.400
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

16:57.560 --> 17:02.160
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

17:02.320 --> 17:05.880
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

17:06.040 --> 17:12.560
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

17:12.720 --> 17:17.480
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

17:17.640 --> 17:22.040
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.360
they go back to their own place.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.720
So going back to the same place is only possible

17:27.880 --> 17:30.720
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.160
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

17:35.320 --> 17:39.280
also they are bound by their own qualities.

17:39.440 --> 17:44.320
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

17:44.480 --> 17:46.720
and a lion will be a lion.

17:46.880 --> 17:50.480
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.760
So they could be anything, you can’t say

17:52.920 --> 17:56.800
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.560
And once they become anything like that

17:59.720 --> 18:04.320
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

18:04.480 --> 18:06.880
when they are human beings.

18:07.040 --> 18:11.640
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

18:11.800 --> 18:16.720
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

18:16.880 --> 18:21.200
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

18:21.360 --> 18:26.200
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

18:26.360 --> 18:29.280
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

18:29.440 --> 18:33.880
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

18:34.040 --> 18:41.720
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.920
Before the statue they dance

18:44.080 --> 18:50.480
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

18:50.640 --> 18:56.160
music from some very funny films or something.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.280
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

18:59.440 --> 19:03.560
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.920
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

19:08.080 --> 19:10.360
and they were dancing before it.

19:10.520 --> 19:16.120
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

19:16.280 --> 19:20.560
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

19:20.720 --> 19:25.080
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.720
At that time the earth moved

19:28.880 --> 19:38.480
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.960
They all disappeared into earth.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.280
Apart from that there were many others also

19:44.440 --> 19:48.680
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.520
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

19:52.680 --> 20:00.280
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

20:00.440 --> 20:06.360
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

20:06.520 --> 20:11.640
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

20:11.800 --> 20:20.920
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

20:21.080 --> 20:26.040
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.520
They were all right.

20:28.680 --> 20:33.640
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

20:33.800 --> 20:36.316
and this is how they saved the Ashram

20:36.476 --> 20:39.280
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

20:39.440 --> 20:43.680
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

20:43.840 --> 20:47.600
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.240
So we must respect his Ganas,

20:50.400 --> 20:55.000
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

20:55.160 --> 20:57.200
they are acting within us.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.520
They see us what sort of person you are,

21:00.680 --> 21:05.440
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

21:05.600 --> 21:07.603
by your misbehavior

21:07.763 --> 21:12.040
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.200
They give you a chance many a times.

21:14.360 --> 21:21.840
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

21:22.000 --> 21:28.560
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

21:28.720 --> 21:32.640
I should say, calamity for you people.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.400
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

21:35.560 --> 21:38.800
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

21:38.960 --> 21:44.360
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.560
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.240
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

21:50.400 --> 21:56.800
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

21:56.960 --> 22:01.760
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

22:01.920 --> 22:04.640
so we are not at all helped by this.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.520
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

22:07.680 --> 22:11.440
don’t do any worship of any idol

22:11.600 --> 22:15.320
because these idols have been created by human beings

22:15.480 --> 22:20.120
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.600
They are not created by the mother earth

22:22.760 --> 22:25.519
but are copied by people

22:25.679 --> 22:29.160
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.960
So that’s, how any idol you get,

22:33.120 --> 22:39.240
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

22:39.400 --> 22:42.600
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.440
So whatever is not there,

22:45.600 --> 22:49.640
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

22:49.800 --> 22:53.240
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

22:53.400 --> 22:57.360
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

22:57.520 --> 23:00.760
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

23:00.920 --> 23:03.800
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

23:03.960 --> 23:08.600
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.640
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

23:12.800 --> 23:19.120
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

23:19.280 --> 23:24.520
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

23:24.680 --> 23:28.800
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

23:28.960 --> 23:33.480
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

23:33.640 --> 23:38.400
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

23:38.560 --> 23:41.600
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

23:41.760 --> 23:44.800
and how he is doing this to us.”

23:44.960 --> 23:51.320
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

23:51.480 --> 23:57.560
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.080
And then he realized it.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.920
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

24:02.080 --> 24:07.360
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

24:07.520 --> 24:11.800
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

24:11.960 --> 24:14.480
and being very cunning and clever.

24:14.640 --> 24:19.200
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

24:19.360 --> 24:26.640
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

24:26.800 --> 24:32.160
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

24:32.320 --> 24:37.400
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

24:37.560 --> 24:40.680
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.600
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

24:43.760 --> 24:50.000
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

24:50.160 --> 24:53.240
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

24:53.400 --> 24:58.920
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

24:59.080 --> 25:05.960
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

25:06.120 --> 25:14.360
that he can move mountains after mountains.

25:14.520 --> 25:20.920
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

25:21.080 --> 25:28.240
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

25:28.400 --> 25:31.520
can be changed.

25:32.440 --> 25:37.240
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

25:37.400 --> 25:39.480
of the right direction.

25:39.640 --> 25:45.520
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

25:45.680 --> 25:50.080
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

25:50.240 --> 25:53.600
it was the right type and he was successful.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.760
But then what happened, they had stencils

25:56.920 --> 25:59.520
and they started using it from the other side.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.800
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

26:02.960 --> 26:06.080
and then they were all destroyed.

26:06.240 --> 26:10.200
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.448
Also we have proved now

26:12.608 --> 26:16.560
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

26:16.720 --> 26:20.280
is actually from the Carbon atom.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.000
The carbon atom has got Swastika

26:23.160 --> 26:29.960
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

26:30.120 --> 26:32.000
all put in series.

26:32.160 --> 26:37.320
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

26:37.480 --> 26:40.040
look at it from the left side to right side,

26:40.200 --> 26:44.040
what you see is Omkar.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.840
If you see it from right side to left side,

26:47.000 --> 26:48.600
you see the Swastika,

26:48.760 --> 26:55.480
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

26:55.640 --> 27:00.840
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

27:01.000 --> 27:05.680
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

27:05.840 --> 27:09.280
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

27:09.440 --> 27:13.360
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

27:13.520 --> 27:16.680
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

27:16.840 --> 27:21.440
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.640
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

27:25.800 --> 27:27.400
because we are confused.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.680
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

27:29.840 --> 27:31.720
that this is already written there.

27:31.880 --> 27:37.320
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

27:37.480 --> 27:44.720
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

27:44.880 --> 27:51.000
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.000
All the things I have told you about Christ,

27:54.160 --> 28:00.480
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.640
Like Christ had these two fingers,

28:03.800 --> 28:08.120
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

28:08.280 --> 28:12.760
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

28:12.920 --> 28:16.640
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

28:16.800 --> 28:20.320
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

28:20.480 --> 28:23.080
only these two fingers why did he use.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.905
Pointing out towards his father

28:26.065 --> 28:29.980
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

28:30.320 --> 28:33.560
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

28:33.720 --> 28:37.040
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

28:37.200 --> 28:43.880
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

28:44.040 --> 28:49.440
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

28:49.600 --> 28:53.600
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.536
So it all opens out

28:55.696 --> 29:01.112
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

29:01.280 --> 29:05.240
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

29:05.400 --> 29:10.520
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

29:10.680 --> 29:14.680
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.640
You are no more cunning.

29:16.800 --> 29:23.360
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

29:23.520 --> 29:28.600
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

29:28.760 --> 29:33.760
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

29:33.920 --> 29:40.720
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

29:40.880 --> 29:45.600
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

29:45.760 --> 29:49.960
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.160
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

29:53.320 --> 29:59.371
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

29:59.531 --> 30:03.291
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

30:03.451 --> 30:06.880
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.040
We don’t look after the mother earth.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.520
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.640
Actually in Indian culture it is that

30:16.800 --> 30:19.800
when you are getting up in the morning,

30:19.960 --> 30:24.880
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

30:25.040 --> 30:29.320
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

30:29.480 --> 30:32.560
because I am touching you with my feet.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.040
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

30:35.200 --> 30:36.920
then you won’t exploit it,

30:37.080 --> 30:40.680
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.680
It all comes out of our ignorance

30:43.840 --> 30:48.240
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

30:48.400 --> 30:52.080
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.720
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

30:56.880 --> 30:59.800
what is to be done.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.880
The mother earth itself we should look after,

31:03.040 --> 31:06.640
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

31:06.800 --> 31:09.040
we can do all kinds of things

31:09.200 --> 31:14.720
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

31:14.880 --> 31:19.560
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.800
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

31:22.960 --> 31:27.520
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

31:27.680 --> 31:29.560
is a very wrong thing.

31:29.720 --> 31:33.320
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

31:33.480 --> 31:35.480
you should put another one there.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.000
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

31:39.160 --> 31:43.600
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

31:43.760 --> 31:51.200
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.560
I don’t know how they live but they do

31:54.720 --> 32:00.720
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.760
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

32:04.920 --> 32:10.800
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

32:10.960 --> 32:13.960
that it should get the sunrays.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.680
There is no quarrel about it.

32:15.840 --> 32:19.480
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

32:19.640 --> 32:24.760
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

32:24.920 --> 32:27.120
The animals also don’t destroy,

32:27.280 --> 32:30.320
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

32:30.480 --> 32:34.160
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

32:34.320 --> 32:36.800
do not destroy anything

32:36.960 --> 32:42.840
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.120
Whatever may be the cry for this,

32:46.280 --> 32:50.040
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.040
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

32:53.200 --> 32:57.160
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

32:57.320 --> 33:02.160
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.720
He is the greatest yogi we have

33:04.880 --> 33:08.320
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

33:08.480 --> 33:14.600
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

33:14.760 --> 33:23.120
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

33:23.280 --> 33:26.000
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

33:26.160 --> 33:28.120
and we should really worship him.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.930
Through him all deities are worshiped

33:31.090 --> 33:38.320
and are made happy and blissful.

33:38.480 --> 33:43.960
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

33:44.120 --> 33:49.240
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

33:49.400 --> 34:00.520
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

34:00.680 --> 34:05.160
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

34:05.320 --> 34:08.320
but you are dishonoring yourself

34:08.480 --> 34:11.920
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

34:12.080 --> 34:17.760
by becoming so sinful.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.400
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

34:21.560 --> 34:27.800
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.440
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

34:31.600 --> 34:35.120
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

34:35.280 --> 34:39.200
Decency is very important in understanding,

34:39.360 --> 34:45.360
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

34:45.520 --> 34:51.880
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

34:52.040 --> 34:56.120
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

34:56.280 --> 35:00.040
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

35:00.200 --> 35:04.438
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

35:04.598 --> 35:08.273
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

35:08.433 --> 35:14.209
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

35:14.369 --> 35:18.760
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

35:18.920 --> 35:23.663
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

35:23.823 --> 35:26.051
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

35:26.211 --> 35:28.673
because men can develop so many diseases

35:28.833 --> 35:32.481
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

35:33.322 --> 35:40.377
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

35:40.537 --> 35:43.736
because he is all the time repairing our body.

35:43.896 --> 35:47.581
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

35:47.741 --> 35:53.592
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.505
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

35:56.665 --> 35:59.040
he is protecting our Kundalini.

35:59.200 --> 36:05.779
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

36:05.939 --> 36:11.537
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

36:11.697 --> 36:15.981
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

36:16.141 --> 36:20.160
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

36:20.320 --> 36:27.181
which is also a basis of your self realization.

36:27.341 --> 36:30.779
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

36:30.939 --> 36:33.716
and you should find out about yourself,

36:33.876 --> 36:38.495
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

36:38.655 --> 36:41.040
If we are; what are we doing about it?

36:41.200 --> 36:47.381
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

36:47.541 --> 36:50.303
You will not like them, will not like such people.

36:50.463 --> 36:53.585
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.659
The children are the best as we know.

36:56.819 --> 37:04.246
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

37:04.406 --> 37:08.621
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

37:08.781 --> 37:12.116
He is the one who is really innocent

37:12.276 --> 37:16.524
but extremely, protective of you,

37:16.684 --> 37:20.158
very much protective, with his innocence.

37:20.318 --> 37:22.894
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

37:23.054 --> 37:26.800
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

37:26.960 --> 37:29.644
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

37:29.804 --> 37:33.094
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

37:33.254 --> 37:38.315
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

37:38.475 --> 37:40.640
people are talking about it that

37:40.800 --> 37:44.864
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

37:45.024 --> 37:48.219
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

37:48.379 --> 37:55.160
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

37:55.320 --> 37:59.878
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

38:00.038 --> 38:03.688
In America, I was surprised to see that

38:03.848 --> 38:06.600
there were so many Red Indians,

38:06.760 --> 38:10.600
who are called as Indian Americans.

38:10.760 --> 38:15.887
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

38:16.047 --> 38:20.198
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

38:20.358 --> 38:23.000
I found the vibrations were so good.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.800
That means they were very innocent, simple people

38:25.960 --> 38:28.979
and Americans that time, who went there,

38:29.139 --> 38:32.000
tried to completely finish them.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.489
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

38:35.649 --> 38:39.240
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

38:39.400 --> 38:42.250
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

38:42.410 --> 38:46.120
still the people who live there or worked about

38:46.280 --> 38:51.421
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

38:51.581 --> 38:56.154
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

38:56.314 --> 38:58.489
But they are so simple and innocent

38:58.649 --> 39:01.600
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

39:01.760 --> 39:04.400
because they used to worship the Mother.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.200
All the time they worship the Mother.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.960
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

39:11.120 --> 39:16.220
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

39:16.380 --> 39:19.180
They have many Maoris and all those people

39:19.340 --> 39:21.060
and they encourage all of them

39:21.220 --> 39:25.060
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

39:25.220 --> 39:32.303
and they are bringing them to this state to show

39:32.469 --> 39:37.176
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

39:37.336 --> 39:39.540
Its a very good venture.

39:39.700 --> 39:46.420
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

39:46.580 --> 39:51.239
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

39:51.399 --> 39:56.318
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

39:56.478 --> 40:00.580
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

40:00.740 --> 40:01.980
from the mother earth.

40:02.140 --> 40:05.900
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

40:06.060 --> 40:13.220
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

40:13.380 --> 40:15.016
That’s what it is.

40:15.176 --> 40:19.856
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

40:20.016 --> 40:23.580
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

40:23.740 --> 40:26.081
and Government also has never troubled us

40:26.241 --> 40:28.696
or there has been no problem with them.

40:28.856 --> 40:31.401
I don’t know what’s this helping them

40:31.561 --> 40:35.921
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

40:36.081 --> 40:40.370
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

40:40.530 --> 40:44.421
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

40:44.581 --> 40:46.671
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

40:46.831 --> 40:51.075
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

40:51.235 --> 40:53.359
You will be helped, miraculously

40:53.519 --> 40:58.730
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

40:58.928 --> 41:00.753
May God Bless You.
