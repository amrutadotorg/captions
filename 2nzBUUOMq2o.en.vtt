ETVD Unknown TC:BC 13-09-2015

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:43.640
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri G anesha.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.640
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.979
His power comes from his innocence.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:02.781
When we see small children we are automatically

00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:06.400
compelled towards them

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.920
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.840
And very innocent they are,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.440
extremely innocent,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.960
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.920
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.800
These days people have become extremely cunning,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.600
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.160
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.200
who are innocent and simple.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.600
They can justify themselves always

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.680
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
when everybody is so cunning.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:16.200
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520
which is very much punishable,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.360
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.360
which are physical, you can say.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.680
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.880
Also, they can have other troubles

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.560
with their liver treatments and all that.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.600
All this comes up. Then to punish them

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.280
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.680
At this time, when you have these problems,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.080
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.120
should worship Shri Ganesha.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.680
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.160
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.360
extra work, I should say, than normal.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.080
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.520
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:41.000
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.800
One of the two things come up

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.120
and he does not know where he is going.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.320
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.960
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.320
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.677
All these diseases of the right side

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:14.240
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.200
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.640
but there is a simple way to remember him

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.200
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.120
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.040
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.880
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.760
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.600
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.560
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.240
and all the worries from you.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.320
So this is the most important deity we have.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.680
Though its a very simple deity.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.360
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.720
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.400
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.400
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.280
So to steady down these

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.480
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.680
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.640
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.800
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.120
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.520
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.640
he never said who it was.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.600
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.200
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.080
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.920
he used to go all out to fight it.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.040
Same is Shri Ganesha.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.120
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.160
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.480
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.320
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.760
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.520
in different troubles and hurdles and also

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.160
different type of very very difficult times.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.760
It is his style that he manages things so well

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.600
because he is a Ganapati.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.720
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.480
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:28.640
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.720
who report if there is any problem.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.000
They report to the brain that there is a problem

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.800
and on the sternum bone is the residence

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.600
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:58.600
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.320
sternum bone starts vibrating

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.960
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.120
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.240
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.360
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.480
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.280
are helped by Ganas is not true.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.760
Also the people who are mentally upset,

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.640
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.920
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.000
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:54.640
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.440
Now his parents start crying for Mother

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.560
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.320
that they immediately rush to that place

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.960
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.720
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:22.520
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.280
They are also small like him

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.040
and they are very active and very alert.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.160
They never sleep.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.360
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.360
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.680
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.080
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.400
For example there was a boy who got drowned

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.800
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.880
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.600
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.920
because there were children.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.640
So one boy fell down into that

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.000
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.120
Nobody knew he was there.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.800
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.520
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.480
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.160
After that they got so frightened

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.920
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.600
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.030
I didn’t know even the address.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.600
But I asked to telephone to this number,

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.680
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:58.440
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.680
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.400
and he will be saved.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.560
Nobody had told me anything.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.320
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.160
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.200
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.880
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.920
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.520
If there is one chance of his surviving,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.600
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.720
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.800
So, like this, so many things happen

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.920
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.520
your blessings that this has happened.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.520
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.120
but because of Shri Ganesha.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.760
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.280
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:03.280
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.880
To him his Mother is everything.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.040
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:15.720
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:23.240
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.000
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.560
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.880
but His work is tremendous.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.760
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.680
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.520
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.800
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.480
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.080
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.240
Its not only in women but also in men,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.560
he expects chastity to be present.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.920
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.320
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.400
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.720
of communicating with young women and young men

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.640
and spoiling your chastity.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.640
Even your eyes should be clean,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.320
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.400
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.000
what mistakes you have committed

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.000
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:58.440
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.960
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.360
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.160
but that is a very important thing.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.480
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.200
We should be very chaste.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.400
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.200
But religions have become so useless now,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.640
have become without any basis,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:38.320
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.880
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.240
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.440
Actually the religions have failed completely

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.440
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.720
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.080
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.760
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:10.600
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.560
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:22.320
and where people are also having very bad morals.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.120
He creates problems for them. What happens that

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:34.160
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.704
Earthquake takes place in places where

00:15:36.864 --> 00:15:40.520
there is no respect of chastity,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.520
also where there are fundamentalist

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:51.520
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.440
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.880
So the Mother earth also understands.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.480
Now we have so many earthquakes,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.920
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.080
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.000
So he protects them.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.880
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.080
he tries to destroy them,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.200
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:32.120
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.000
he attracts people towards himself,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.000
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.800
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.480
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.680
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.400
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.160
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.880
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:12.560
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.480
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.040
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.360
they go back to their own place.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.720
So going back to the same place is only possible

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.720
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.160
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.280
also they are bound by their own qualities.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.320
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.720
and a lion will be a lion.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.480
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.760
So they could be anything, you can’t say

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.800
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.560
And once they become anything like that

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.320
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.880
when they are human beings.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.640
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.720
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.200
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.200
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.280
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.880
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:41.720
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.920
Before the statue they dance

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.480
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.160
music from some very funny films or something.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.280
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.560
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.920
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.360
and they were dancing before it.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.120
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.560
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.080
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.720
At that time the earth moved

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:38.480
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.960
They all disappeared into earth.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.280
Apart from that there were many others also

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.680
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.520
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:00.280
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:06.360
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.640
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:20.920
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.040
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.520
They were all right.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.640
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.316
and this is how they saved the Ashram

00:20:36.476 --> 00:20:39.280
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.680
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.600
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.240
So we must respect his Ganas,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.000
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.200
they are acting within us.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.520
They see us what sort of person you are,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.440
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.603
by your misbehavior

00:21:07.763 --> 00:21:12.040
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.200
They give you a chance many a times.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:21.840
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.560
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.640
I should say, calamity for you people.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.400
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.800
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.360
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.560
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.240
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.800
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.760
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.640
so we are not at all helped by this.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.520
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.440
don’t do any worship of any idol

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.320
because these idols have been created by human beings

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.120
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.600
They are not created by the mother earth

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.519
but are copied by people

00:22:25.679 --> 00:22:29.160
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.960
So that’s, how any idol you get,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.240
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.600
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.440
So whatever is not there,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.640
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.240
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.360
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.760
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.800
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.600
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.640
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:19.120
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.520
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.800
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.480
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.400
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.600
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.800
and how he is doing this to us.”

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:51.320
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:57.560
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.080
And then he realized it.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.920
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.360
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.800
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.480
and being very cunning and clever.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.200
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:26.640
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.160
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:37.400
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.680
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.600
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:50.000
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.240
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.920
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:05.960
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:14.360
that he can move mountains after mountains.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.920
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:28.240
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.520
can be changed.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.240
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.480
of the right direction.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.520
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.080
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.600
it was the right type and he was successful.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.760
But then what happened, they had stencils

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.520
and they started using it from the other side.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.800
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.080
and then they were all destroyed.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.200
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.448
Also we have proved now

00:26:12.608 --> 00:26:16.560
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.280
is actually from the Carbon atom.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.000
The carbon atom has got Swastika

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:29.960
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.000
all put in series.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.320
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.040
look at it from the left side to right side,

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.040
what you see is Omkar.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.840
If you see it from right side to left side,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.600
you see the Swastika,

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:55.480
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:00.840
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.680
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.280
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.360
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.680
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.440
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.640
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.400
because we are confused.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.680
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.720
that this is already written there.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:37.320
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:44.720
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:51.000
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.000
All the things I have told you about Christ,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.480
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.640
Like Christ had these two fingers,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.120
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.760
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.640
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.320
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.080
only these two fingers why did he use.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.905
Pointing out towards his father

00:28:26.065 --> 00:28:29.980
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.560
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.040
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:43.880
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:49.440
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.600
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.536
So it all opens out

00:28:55.696 --> 00:29:01.112
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.240
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.520
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.680
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.640
You are no more cunning.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:23.360
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.600
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.760
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.720
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.600
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.960
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.160
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:59.371
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:03.291
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

00:30:03.451 --> 00:30:06.880
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.040
We don’t look after the mother earth.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.520
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.640
Actually in Indian culture it is that

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.800
when you are getting up in the morning,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.880
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.320
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.560
because I am touching you with my feet.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.040
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.920
then you won’t exploit it,

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.680
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.680
It all comes out of our ignorance

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.240
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.080
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.720
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.800
what is to be done.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.880
The mother earth itself we should look after,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.640
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.040
we can do all kinds of things

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.720
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.560
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.800
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.520
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.560
is a very wrong thing.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.320
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.480
you should put another one there.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.000
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.600
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:51.200
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.560
I don’t know how they live but they do

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.720
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.760
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.800
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.960
that it should get the sunrays.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.680
There is no quarrel about it.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.480
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:24.760
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.120
The animals also don’t destroy,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.320
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.160
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.800
do not destroy anything

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.840
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.120
Whatever may be the cry for this,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.040
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.040
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.160
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.160
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.720
He is the greatest yogi we have

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.320
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.600
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:23.120
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.000
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.120
and we should really worship him.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.930
Through him all deities are worshiped

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:38.320
and are made happy and blissful.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.960
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.240
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:34:00.520
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.160
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.320
but you are dishonoring yourself

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.920
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.760
by becoming so sinful.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.400
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:27.800
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.440
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.120
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.200
Decency is very important in understanding,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.360
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:51.880
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.120
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.040
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.438
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

00:35:04.598 --> 00:35:08.273
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:14.209
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

00:35:14.369 --> 00:35:18.760
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.663
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

00:35:23.823 --> 00:35:26.051
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

00:35:26.211 --> 00:35:28.673
because men can develop so many diseases

00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:32.481
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

00:35:33.322 --> 00:35:40.377
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

00:35:40.537 --> 00:35:43.736
because he is all the time repairing our body.

00:35:43.896 --> 00:35:47.581
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

00:35:47.741 --> 00:35:53.592
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:56.505
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

00:35:56.665 --> 00:35:59.040
he is protecting our Kundalini.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:05.779
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

00:36:05.939 --> 00:36:11.537
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

00:36:11.697 --> 00:36:15.981
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

00:36:16.141 --> 00:36:20.160
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:27.181
which is also a basis of your self realization.

00:36:27.341 --> 00:36:30.779
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:33.716
and you should find out about yourself,

00:36:33.876 --> 00:36:38.495
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

00:36:38.655 --> 00:36:41.040
If we are; what are we doing about it?

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:47.381
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:50.303
You will not like them, will not like such people.

00:36:50.463 --> 00:36:53.585
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:56.659
The children are the best as we know.

00:36:56.819 --> 00:37:04.246
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

00:37:04.406 --> 00:37:08.621
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

00:37:08.781 --> 00:37:12.116
He is the one who is really innocent

00:37:12.276 --> 00:37:16.524
but extremely, protective of you,

00:37:16.684 --> 00:37:20.158
very much protective, with his innocence.

00:37:20.318 --> 00:37:22.894
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

00:37:23.054 --> 00:37:26.800
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.644
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

00:37:29.804 --> 00:37:33.094
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

00:37:33.254 --> 00:37:38.315
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:40.640
people are talking about it that

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.864
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

00:37:45.024 --> 00:37:48.219
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

00:37:48.379 --> 00:37:55.160
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.878
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

00:38:00.038 --> 00:38:03.688
In America, I was surprised to see that

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:06.600
there were so many Red Indians,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.600
who are called as Indian Americans.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.887
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

00:38:16.047 --> 00:38:20.198
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

00:38:20.358 --> 00:38:23.000
I found the vibrations were so good.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.800
That means they were very innocent, simple people

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.979
and Americans that time, who went there,

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:32.000
tried to completely finish them.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.489
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:39.240
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.250
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.120
still the people who live there or worked about

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.421
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:56.154
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

00:38:56.314 --> 00:38:58.489
But they are so simple and innocent

00:38:58.649 --> 00:39:01.600
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.400
because they used to worship the Mother.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.200
All the time they worship the Mother.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.960
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:16.220
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.180
They have many Maoris and all those people

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.060
and they encourage all of them

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.060
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:32.303
and they are bringing them to this state to show

00:39:32.469 --> 00:39:37.176
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

00:39:37.336 --> 00:39:39.540
Its a very good venture.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:46.420
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.239
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

00:39:51.399 --> 00:39:56.318
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

00:39:56.478 --> 00:40:00.580
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:01.980
from the mother earth.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.900
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:13.220
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.016
That’s what it is.

00:40:15.176 --> 00:40:19.856
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

00:40:20.016 --> 00:40:23.580
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.081
and Government also has never troubled us

00:40:26.241 --> 00:40:28.696
or there has been no problem with them.

00:40:28.856 --> 00:40:31.401
I don’t know what’s this helping them

00:40:31.561 --> 00:40:35.921
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

00:40:36.081 --> 00:40:40.370
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:44.421
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

00:40:44.581 --> 00:40:46.671
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

00:40:46.831 --> 00:40:51.075
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

00:40:51.235 --> 00:40:53.359
You will be helped, miraculously

00:40:53.519 --> 00:40:58.730
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

00:40:58.928 --> 00:41:00.753
May God Bless You.
