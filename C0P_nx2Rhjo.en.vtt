00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:30.097
Tonight we have
gathered here

00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:34.346
to do the Puja to
the Devi,

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:37.222
that is Mahakali
- we can call Her

00:11:37.388 --> 00:11:41.930
or Durga.

00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:46.764
So many types of
forms She has taken,

00:11:47.056 --> 00:11:49.222
to kill

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:55.264
the negative forces that
are trying to trouble

00:11:55.472 --> 00:11:58.097
or to obstruct,

00:11:58.346 --> 00:12:02.264
or even to grow

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:07.139
the people who were

00:12:08.097 --> 00:12:11.805
gentle and good.

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:18.181
Her forms are of
different types

00:12:18.388 --> 00:12:21.264
that we know about,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.847
that She destroyed
so many rakshasas,

00:12:26.097 --> 00:12:29.513
She destroyed so
many evildoers.

00:12:29.722 --> 00:12:32.097
Also we do not know

00:12:32.346 --> 00:12:35.972
that, in the World
Wars that we had,

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:41.764
She was there to protect
the right type of people.

00:12:42.014 --> 00:12:45.306
And that’s how
they all survived

00:12:45.472 --> 00:12:49.346
the ill-blood plan,

00:12:49.555 --> 00:12:53.597
ill-gotten plan
of very cruel

00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:56.889
and evil people.

00:12:58.306 --> 00:13:02.181
The evil people have
a capacity to hate.

00:13:02.388 --> 00:13:08.181
And to express their hate in
every way that is possible.

00:13:08.722 --> 00:13:16.388
They are really born evil and
there are also who ‘become’ evil.

00:13:17.014 --> 00:13:20.930
When they are

00:13:21.972 --> 00:13:26.764
born evil, you can
make them out.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:31.056
That their whole style
is so aggressive,

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:35.638
and so vindictive

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:37.597
about things.

00:13:37.847 --> 00:13:41.680
But hatred has no limit,

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.805
no limits at all.
Because, if they hate,

00:13:47.014 --> 00:13:50.430
if they hate someone,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:57.264
then, just to justify that hatred,
they’ll say all kinds of things.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:02.847
Just to justify. But sometimes
they don’t even want to justify.

00:14:03.097 --> 00:14:05.181
They just feel that
they ‘hate’

00:14:05.388 --> 00:14:09.181
and it’s a fundamental right
they have got to hate.

00:14:09.388 --> 00:14:14.805
But these forces join
together sometimes to form

00:14:15.014 --> 00:14:20.264
to form a joint
personality of evil,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:25.680
which tries to torture the
human beings and trouble them.

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:31.139
They might take any name. They
might call them by anything,

00:14:31.346 --> 00:14:36.764
but they are absolutely
hundred per cent evil.

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:39.181
and for such persons

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:47.597
there’s no pity or compassion
from the God Almighty.

00:14:47.847 --> 00:14:50.222
These are to be
destroyed.

00:14:50.388 --> 00:14:52.930
And that is the job
of the Goddess

00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:59.347
to destroy them, who is a Mother,
full of compassion and love.

00:15:00.014 --> 00:15:04.555
It’s a very contradictory
work the Goddess has to do

00:15:04.805 --> 00:15:10.181
to kill these people, because, in
the larger interest, it is important

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:17.847
that all such evil people
should be destroyed, completely.

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:20.805
But they do not.

00:15:21.097 --> 00:15:24.889
They, like they go to jail for
some time. Like that, they

00:15:25.181 --> 00:15:27.222
go to hell for some
time, suffer

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.139
and, again, they come
back much more strong

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:35.930
and then again try to trouble
good saintly people.

00:15:36.181 --> 00:15:39.056
It’s a common style

00:15:39.264 --> 00:15:45.513
they are all over the world.
They can come in the form

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:47.972
of a very good man,

00:15:48.181 --> 00:15:52.847
of a very gentle man, or of a
man who “knows a lot about God”

00:15:53.056 --> 00:15:57.181
or they can also say
that they can

00:15:57.472 --> 00:15:59.972
give you Realisation.

00:16:00.346 --> 00:16:03.805
All kinds of lies
they are capable of,

00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:09.597
because they have that power
evil, power of doing evil.

00:16:09.805 --> 00:16:12.889
So they take to all
kinds of falsehood

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:16.847
and they proclaim that:
“We are this and we are that,”

00:16:17.097 --> 00:16:21.555
and “ We can give
you this or that.”

00:16:22.638 --> 00:16:26.555
Actually, they have come on
this Earth to ruin people.

00:16:26.805 --> 00:16:29.972
We’ve had many of
these false people

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:33.472
and many stupid
people followed them.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.764
They never talked
against each other.

00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:41.014
Christ has said that,

00:16:41.472 --> 00:16:45.014
“The devil won’t talk
against its own house.”

00:16:45.306 --> 00:16:49.513
As if they are in ‘one’ house.
And in ‘one’ house they live

00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:51.597
and they cannot talk,

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:57.764
they cannot talk
of something

00:16:58.014 --> 00:17:02.222
that may disturb their
collectivity or their fraternity.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.014
The fraternity is so
great that,

00:17:06.222 --> 00:17:09.139
wherever they are,
they ‘know’

00:17:09.388 --> 00:17:14.181
that they are together.
Just imagine.

00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:17.346
all the evil people
should join together

00:17:17.555 --> 00:17:21.764
and behave in this manner
is very surprising.

00:17:22.139 --> 00:17:24.139
That way, they are
very collective.

00:17:24.347 --> 00:17:29.930
Supposing one has taken a
particular part of the land,

00:17:30.222 --> 00:17:33.597
then he dominates there. Another
takes up in another way.

00:17:33.805 --> 00:17:36.972
Third one takes. There’s
no competition as such.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.805
Ultimate effort is, somehow
or other,

00:17:41.097 --> 00:17:45.264
to destroy all the
creation of God,

00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:47.513
all the good people
of the world,

00:17:47.722 --> 00:17:53.388
who will ultimately get
their Self-Realisation

00:17:53.597 --> 00:17:59.472
and who will have the
Knowledge about Reality.

00:18:00.347 --> 00:18:06.597
This kind of atmosphere is
the worst during Kali Yuga

00:18:06.889 --> 00:18:10.181
and there are so many
stupid, stupid people,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.388
who may be simple, who
may be good-natured,

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.638
but they get drawn by the
evil doing of these people,

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:23.056
while the good people
also sometimes

00:18:23.306 --> 00:18:27.597
follow suite. They also try to
follow them. It’s very surprising.

00:18:27.847 --> 00:18:32.347
Why should good people not under-
stand what is good and what is bad?

00:18:32.555 --> 00:18:35.847
But, that discrimination,
many good people also lack

00:18:36.097 --> 00:18:38.972
and that’s why they
take to wrong things.

00:18:39.222 --> 00:18:42.181
And then they go on
justifying all the time

00:18:42.347 --> 00:18:44.889
whatever they are doing
is the right thing,

00:18:45.097 --> 00:18:49.430
is the best thing, they
have the proof of it.

00:18:50.638 --> 00:18:55.430
Now, as you know, there has
been many of them in Kali Yuga

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.222
and so many of them have now
disappeared from this Earth

00:19:01.597 --> 00:19:07.097
and now they cannot trouble us.
But there are still some more,

00:19:07.388 --> 00:19:09.388
who are exposed.

00:19:09.638 --> 00:19:13.597
People have exposed
them so much

00:19:13.847 --> 00:19:16.847
that nobody can expose

00:19:17.306 --> 00:19:21.264
anybody without any proof.

00:19:21.472 --> 00:19:23.513
But they have such courage

00:19:23.722 --> 00:19:27.722
and they are so
full of confidence

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:31.264
that they can do
what they like,

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.930
and anybody tries
to expose them,

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:38.014
they will definitely
ruin that person.

00:19:38.346 --> 00:19:40.472
A few things they
are doing.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:45.181
First of all, they put wrong
ideas into your head.

00:19:45.472 --> 00:19:48.472
They say that:
"We are very

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.014
great people we are this, we
are that. God has sent us."

00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:54.014
All sorts of things they will talk.

00:19:54.264 --> 00:19:56.805
But there is no proof
about it.

00:19:57.014 --> 00:20:00.139
And human beings never
ask for the proof,

00:20:00.346 --> 00:20:02.805
as to: “How do you say?

00:20:03.014 --> 00:20:05.014
What is the proof? ”

00:20:05.306 --> 00:20:08.347
So the solution is
the Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:08.638 --> 00:20:13.638
In Sahaja Yoga, you have
the experience. You have the proof.

00:20:13.889 --> 00:20:16.805
Then you grow into it.

00:20:17.056 --> 00:20:21.056
Immediately you cannot be a great
Sahaja Yogi, that’s a fact.

00:20:21.306 --> 00:20:23.388
You have to mature.

00:20:23.638 --> 00:20:25.805
It takes some time
for some people.

00:20:26.014 --> 00:20:29.264
It takes some more time for
other people. It doesn’t matter.

00:20:29.555 --> 00:20:31.430
But you do mature.

00:20:31.638 --> 00:20:35.222
In the meanwhile, if you try
to go to these wrong people,

00:20:35.388 --> 00:20:37.805
then there is
no possibility,

00:20:38.097 --> 00:20:41.597
there’s no way of
again bringing you up.

00:20:41.805 --> 00:20:45.306
Especially those people who rise
high in Sahaja Yoga, I think.

00:20:45.472 --> 00:20:49.264
If they fall,
they fall so low.

00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:52.347
Then even an ordinary
Sahaja Yogi

00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:55.847
could say: “ Mother, look at him!
Where has he gone?”

00:20:56.181 --> 00:21:00.139
So, with all these
things happening,

00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:05.513
what is our job

00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:09.306
is to worship
Mahakali within us.

00:21:09.555 --> 00:21:14.222
Because, what does She do?
Perhaps we are not very aware of.

00:21:14.597 --> 00:21:19.555
First and foremost thing
She does is to protect us.

00:21:19.805 --> 00:21:24.014
Wherever you may be,
whatever you may be doing,

00:21:24.222 --> 00:21:27.222
in whatever peril you
may be,

00:21:27.472 --> 00:21:31.597
howsoever dangerously you
may be placed in life,

00:21:31.847 --> 00:21:35.847
She protects you. First
thing, She protects you.

00:21:36.097 --> 00:21:39.513
All the people who write to
Me, how they were protected,

00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:43.056
how they were cured,
how they were helped.

00:21:43.306 --> 00:21:45.889
It’s this thing: that
they should know

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:51.597
that all this has happened because
of Mahakali power within you.

00:21:51.972 --> 00:21:54.222
She exists within you.

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.346
When you are
worshipping Mahakali,

00:21:56.513 --> 00:21:58.930
you are worshipping the
Mahakali ‘within you’.

00:21:59.139 --> 00:22:01.139
With due respect,
you must know

00:22:01.346 --> 00:22:04.764
that this Mahakali is a
very sensitive personality.

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:07.346
She is very sensitive.

00:22:07.597 --> 00:22:12.181
If you try to do any
wrong to anyone,

00:22:12.638 --> 00:22:16.222
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell
you by many ways

00:22:16.388 --> 00:22:17.764
that: "This is wrong what
you are doing.

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:20.764
Why are you doing wrong
to some person?”

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.139
But if you do not repent

00:22:23.346 --> 00:22:27.722
and come back onto the normal
position, She gives you up.

00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:32.805
Once Mahakali gives you
up, you are now exposed

00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:37.181
and become prone to all
kinds of evil things.

00:22:37.388 --> 00:22:39.847
I would say…

00:22:43.014 --> 00:22:46.139
“What’s the matter
with the baby?”

00:23:07.972 --> 00:23:10.555
So, when you worship
Her, what do you want?

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:16.056
You want Her to protect you.
In your discrimination,

00:23:16.346 --> 00:23:20.764
in your mistake, you might
do something wrong.

00:23:21.014 --> 00:23:25.139
May do something that
is not good for you,

00:23:25.347 --> 00:23:28.222
could be very dangerous
for you.

00:23:28.472 --> 00:23:31.555
But She is the person
who guides

00:23:31.764 --> 00:23:33.930
how to avoid all
the dangers.

00:23:35.181 --> 00:23:38.847
Now, She protects
your life,

00:23:39.097 --> 00:23:41.097
She protects your body,

00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:44.346
She protects all organs
of your body,

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:49.597
She is the One who gives you
all the security of life.

00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:55.972
In Her realm, you feel
completely secure.

00:23:56.264 --> 00:23:59.014
You are never afraid
of anything.

00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:02.972
Because you have left Her
realm, you have come out of it,

00:24:03.181 --> 00:24:06.264
that is why, that is the
reason you are afraid.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:11.264
But if you are under
Her beautiful

00:24:11.472 --> 00:24:14.306
guidance and Her
blessings,

00:24:14.513 --> 00:24:17.764
you will never feel
afraid to do anything.

00:24:18.181 --> 00:24:20.513
You will never do
anything wrong also.

00:24:20.722 --> 00:24:24.555
As soon as you’ll try to do
wrong, She will hold your hand.

00:24:24.847 --> 00:24:27.347
She is really the
guiding person.

00:24:27.597 --> 00:24:31.597
She is the One who actually
gives us our existence.

00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:36.472
Without Her, we
cannot exist, because

00:24:36.889 --> 00:24:44.306
She is the One who is
the Power of Shri Shiva.

00:24:46.597 --> 00:24:50.722
She gives us so many things.
For example,

00:24:50.972 --> 00:24:57.264
She gives us the
relaxation, the sleep.

00:24:57.597 --> 00:24:59.889
She gives you the Truth.

00:25:00.346 --> 00:25:02.972
She tells you what is the
Truth and what is not.

00:25:03.222 --> 00:25:04.597
Sometimes people

00:25:04.847 --> 00:25:08.222
so much in their ego
always try to believe that:

00:25:08.388 --> 00:25:10.097
“What I think is
the truth.”

00:25:10.306 --> 00:25:16.388
Then She is the One who points
it out by creating a ‘Maya’,

00:25:16.638 --> 00:25:20.638
a kind of a confusion,

00:25:20.972 --> 00:25:24.346
that you start thinking:
“What is this?”

00:25:24.555 --> 00:25:29.972
So She is called also the One who
gives us ‘Bhranti,’ means illusions.

00:25:30.222 --> 00:25:33.430
She puts you to illusions
also. She tells you

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.222
puts you to illusions
and She

00:25:36.388 --> 00:25:39.972
then ultimately takes you
out of the illusions.

00:25:40.638 --> 00:25:42.805
She is the One who
relaxes you,

00:25:43.056 --> 00:25:46.388
because She takes over all
your responsibilities.

00:25:46.638 --> 00:25:48.847
She takes over all
your problems.

00:25:49.097 --> 00:25:51.306
She is the One who
solves all the problems.

00:25:51.472 --> 00:25:55.847
It is we who forget to leave
all the problems to Her.

00:25:56.097 --> 00:26:01.056
If you just leave problems to Her,
all your problems are solved.

00:26:01.306 --> 00:26:05.056
Not only that, but you
really feel blessed.

00:26:05.346 --> 00:26:09.513
It’s not only physical,
also it is mental

00:26:09.764 --> 00:26:14.181
that She makes your mind
absolutely free of worries.

00:26:14.388 --> 00:26:18.930
She doesn’t worry and She
doesn’t want you to worry.

00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:22.014
If you worry, then
She tries to show that,

00:26:22.222 --> 00:26:25.430
by your worry,
you are denying Her.

00:26:25.764 --> 00:26:28.056
You are not accepting Her.

00:26:28.346 --> 00:26:30.472
Worrying is something
very common

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.388
and people take great
pride in saying:

00:26:32.638 --> 00:26:33.889
“Oh, I was worried.”

00:26:34.097 --> 00:26:38.889
How can you be worried when your
Mother is “Sakshat Mahakali”.

00:26:39.222 --> 00:26:42.847
She can kill all the demons.
She can finish all of them.

00:26:43.097 --> 00:26:44.805
She knows how
to manage things.

00:26:45.056 --> 00:26:48.097
And when you are like
a child before Her,

00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:50.680
how can you worry
about anything?

00:26:50.889 --> 00:26:53.472
So your worries
are finished.

00:26:53.764 --> 00:26:56.764
She worries about you, you
shouldn’t worry about yourself.

00:26:57.014 --> 00:27:01.680
That’s the point of it. Her
security is so great,

00:27:01.889 --> 00:27:05.056
She is so secure
Herself, that

00:27:05.264 --> 00:27:09.306
She gives you all the
security that you need.

00:27:09.555 --> 00:27:12.139
You can hold on
to Her feet.

00:27:12.346 --> 00:27:16.597
You can hold on to Her
image or to anything.

00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:18.764
You can even pray to Her.

00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:23.056
Many people are being cured
only by praying to Her.

00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:25.264
Because She cures you.

00:27:25.513 --> 00:27:27.430
She can cure your
diseases,

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.346
which are very complicated
diseases. She can cure.

00:27:31.722 --> 00:27:36.597
Now what She likes ?
Mahakali likes the light.

00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:41.306
She is worshipped in the night,
because then we can put on the light.

00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:44.638
She likes enlightened
persons.

00:27:44.847 --> 00:27:49.346
Also She likes the light.
She likes the Sun. She likes,

00:27:49.513 --> 00:27:55.014
something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

00:27:55.972 --> 00:28:00.388
You must have heard about people
who are called… I don’t know what,

00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:04.847
but especially in the
West they use them.

00:28:05.097 --> 00:28:09.597
They have big teeth
and they

00:28:10.222 --> 00:28:12.388
somebody from the audience
shouts: “vampires.”

00:28:12.638 --> 00:28:16.346
And they are the people,
they just imagine,

00:28:16.513 --> 00:28:20.513
they cannot exist
before the Sun.

00:28:20.722 --> 00:28:26.513
As soon as there is a sunrise,
they just want to go off and sleep.

00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:31.805
Yes, they cannot see the Sun,
because, the light, they can’t bear.

00:28:32.097 --> 00:28:36.472
Now, what has happened here,
that Mahalakshmi, has departed.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.847
Mahakali has departed
from them.

00:28:40.181 --> 00:28:45.056
And when Mahakali has departed,
then they are afraid.

00:28:45.306 --> 00:28:49.555
And such people are
attacked by these people

00:28:49.847 --> 00:28:52.472
who know they are afraid.

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:57.014
The Sun itself is
very important,

00:28:57.264 --> 00:28:59.930
to work out this
Mahakali thing.

00:29:00.181 --> 00:29:03.764
But, as it is, in the
West especially,

00:29:04.014 --> 00:29:07.555
we are very hard-working

00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:12.430
and very much Sun-oriented
and we worship the Sun.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:17.014
All this we do,
worship the Sun

00:29:17.264 --> 00:29:20.388
and also go right-sided
very much.

00:29:20.638 --> 00:29:23.222
Then it is She who
gives us the balance.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.805
She is the One who
gives us the balance,

00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:31.722
by relaxing us completely
and protecting us.

00:29:31.972 --> 00:29:37.346
Sometimes we are competitive
and we are really worried

00:29:37.513 --> 00:29:42.014
and we want to do something
which we cannot do.

00:29:42.388 --> 00:29:45.847
Then we get upset

00:29:46.056 --> 00:29:48.014
and we don’t know
what to do.

00:29:48.264 --> 00:29:53.056
Then it is She who
brings sleep to us.

00:29:53.264 --> 00:29:58.056
So, when we sleep, She looks
after us, She soothes us

00:29:58.306 --> 00:30:01.097
and She takes away
our problems.

00:30:01.306 --> 00:30:03.306
So many things
She is doing.

00:30:03.472 --> 00:30:07.056
But what are we doing for Her?
That we should see.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.638
Main thing is,

00:30:10.014 --> 00:30:16.014
that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

00:30:17.181 --> 00:30:22.264
She likes it that Her
children should worship Her,

00:30:22.597 --> 00:30:26.139
that, on that level, She
can be One with them.

00:30:26.346 --> 00:30:31.346
She can give them Her
compassion, love and protection

00:30:31.555 --> 00:30:33.889
from all the evil.

00:30:34.097 --> 00:30:38.388
But it has to be
understood, those who are

00:30:38.638 --> 00:30:43.555
not yet settled, those
who are not absolutelly

00:30:43.805 --> 00:30:50.056
belonging to that land
of security of Mahakali,

00:30:50.346 --> 00:30:52.264
can be attacked.

00:30:52.472 --> 00:30:59.014
And they… once they leave that
area, they can be very badly

00:30:59.889 --> 00:31:03.764
injured, killed, whatever
way can happen.

00:31:03.972 --> 00:31:06.222
So, we are living in
this Kali Yuga

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:12.181
in very dangerous times.

00:31:12.347 --> 00:31:14.513
Whence anything
can happen.

00:31:14.764 --> 00:31:17.555
So we have to be
very careful.

00:31:17.805 --> 00:31:22.097
We have to watch our mind,
to see how it works.

00:31:22.346 --> 00:31:25.805
What does it teach you?
What does it tell you?

00:31:26.056 --> 00:31:27.638
Try to understand

00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:33.889
what is the plan of
this evil person,

00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:37.347
that you are playing
into his hands?

00:31:37.597 --> 00:31:39.847
How can you play
into his hands

00:31:40.056 --> 00:31:44.306
and how can you do whatever
wrong he wants you to do?

00:31:44.638 --> 00:31:48.056
Secondly, against
Her is the ego.

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:51.805
The biggest problem
is the ego today.

00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:55.139
Ego will show:
“No, no, I can do this.”

00:31:55.346 --> 00:31:58.805
Ego says:
“I will work it out.”

00:31:59.264 --> 00:32:02.014
Ego says:
“It will be done.”

00:32:02.264 --> 00:32:06.764
But the human beings –
see – yield to ego.

00:32:07.014 --> 00:32:11.847
It’s of a great satisfaction to
them that their ego is so strong.

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:17.513
and they don’t want to listen
to the Mahakali forces.

00:32:19.472 --> 00:32:22.680
Take the boy (Anant)
outside.

00:32:26.472 --> 00:32:29.513
He wants Me, you see.
Children are like that.

00:32:29.722 --> 00:32:33.346
They can’t leave
you for even…

00:32:38.555 --> 00:32:42.722
You have to be like children.
Really, that’s the very best way,

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.346
is to be innocent like children.
She loves innocent people.

00:32:47.597 --> 00:32:51.388
She is Innocence Herself.
She loves innocent people

00:32:51.597 --> 00:32:54.056
and She looks after
you much more

00:32:54.264 --> 00:32:56.680
because you are innocent.
You are not cunning.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.638
You are not very much...

00:33:01.889 --> 00:33:06.638
trying to play your
ego on others.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.930
If you are innocent,
She’ll help you.

00:33:10.181 --> 00:33:12.346
She definitely will
help you.

00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:16.097
But this ego has to be
brought under control,

00:33:16.346 --> 00:33:20.181
because he is
the worst enemy

00:33:20.388 --> 00:33:23.430
She has. She doesn’t
like your ego.

00:33:23.638 --> 00:33:26.805
She wants you to be
ego-less, to be innocent.

00:33:27.014 --> 00:33:33.430
As you know that it is, first She
came and She created Shri Ganesha

00:33:33.805 --> 00:33:37.181
That’s why we worship
Shri Ganesha.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.346
We have to be innocent.

00:33:39.555 --> 00:33:43.847
Means: we are not
planning to do something

00:33:44.097 --> 00:33:48.930
bad or good or anything, but
we are without any intentions.

00:33:49.139 --> 00:33:57.014
We are just…It’s
a timeless activity.

00:33:57.222 --> 00:34:00.222
You just don’t bother about
what you are going to do,

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.139
what you are not going to do,
what you should do.

00:34:03.346 --> 00:34:04.722
Nothing of the kind!

00:34:04.972 --> 00:34:09.513
You are just existing
in your complete innocence

00:34:09.764 --> 00:34:13.388
and enjoying yourself and
making others enjoy.

00:34:13.597 --> 00:34:17.847
If there’s one child in the house,
he can make hundred people dance.

00:34:18.097 --> 00:34:23.930
It’s like that. Because these
children have the power of innocence.

00:34:24.181 --> 00:34:29.597
and that is what She respects.
We sometimes feel that,

00:34:30.472 --> 00:34:33.306
how people are cheats.
How they cheat us!

00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:37.805
How they make
all kinds of,

00:34:38.555 --> 00:34:43.638
I should say - aggressiveness!
Sometimes, how they try to

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:45.722
also tell lies!

00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:48.555
All kinds of things
they will do

00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:51.555
and they expect so
much from you also.

00:34:51.805 --> 00:34:56.638
But all this is
happening… is happening.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.722
You shouldn’t bother
about these things.

00:34:58.972 --> 00:35:00.930
You should keep
to your innocence

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:05.513
and, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll be completely protected.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:11.388
How? Because Mahakali
will stand around you.

00:35:11.597 --> 00:35:15.597
She will look after you,
if you are innocent.

00:35:15.889 --> 00:35:20.430
Innocent person doesn’t get angry.
What is there to get angry?

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.680
Innocence has its
own, I should say,

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.722
strength, power. It’s
extremely powerful.

00:35:30.972 --> 00:35:34.346
Even a cruel man,
if he sees a child,

00:35:34.555 --> 00:35:38.139
he becomes a little bit aware
of it: “There’s a child.”

00:35:38.346 --> 00:35:42.014
The whole world is aware
that children should not be

00:35:42.264 --> 00:35:44.847
any way tortured
or troubled. Why?

00:35:45.139 --> 00:35:50.889
Because children are so innocent.
So the quality of innocence

00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:54.097
is going to really
help you very much,

00:35:54.346 --> 00:36:00.014
because She appreciates
your quality of innocence.

00:36:00.847 --> 00:36:05.306
Then another thing She loves
in you is your compassion.

00:36:05.555 --> 00:36:09.346
Compassion for each other.
Love for each other.

00:36:09.555 --> 00:36:14.722
Also caring for others. That
is something She loves.

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:18.056
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if
you are a Realised Soul,

00:36:18.346 --> 00:36:19.597
She is always with you.

00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:24.764
But She says: “What are you
doing with your compassion?

00:36:25.014 --> 00:36:27.346
How many people you are
giving Realisation?

00:36:27.555 --> 00:36:31.513
How many people
you are curing?

00:36:31.805 --> 00:36:33.722
How many people
you are helping?

00:36:34.014 --> 00:36:37.264
She is quite aware of
whatever you are doing.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:41.930
I should say, it’s such a
tremendous power of Mahakali

00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:45.264
that She knows
everything about you.

00:36:45.472 --> 00:36:47.889
Everything! She knows
your mind.

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:49.847
She knows about
your heart.

00:36:50.139 --> 00:36:51.930
She knows about
your health.

00:36:52.181 --> 00:36:56.346
Everything  She knows.
Actually, She is the Mother,

00:36:56.555 --> 00:37:01.306
in every way, who cares
for the little child.

00:37:01.555 --> 00:37:05.222
In that way, She knows that
this child doesn’t do anything.

00:37:05.472 --> 00:37:06.680
He’s very innocent.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:11.346
So, like, when you are very small,
your mother looks after you.

00:37:11.513 --> 00:37:15.346
In the same way, this
Mahakali looks after you.

00:37:15.597 --> 00:37:20.306
Then the Mahasaraswati
power comes in and She

00:37:20.722 --> 00:37:23.638
educates you.
She gives you

00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:28.388
other ideas of knowledge…
this, that.

00:37:28.638 --> 00:37:32.306
But, looking after
the child in you,

00:37:32.472 --> 00:37:36.930
looking after your innocence
and your compassion,

00:37:37.181 --> 00:37:39.805
is all done by this
Mahakali power.

00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:44.388
So, She is extremely sensitive
about Her children.

00:37:44.805 --> 00:37:47.139
Nobody dare touch
Her children!

00:37:47.346 --> 00:37:50.597
For Her, everybody
is like a child.

00:37:50.847 --> 00:37:54.805
Those who are Realised Souls
especially, She thinks are children

00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:57.513
and in no way they
should be hurt.

00:37:57.722 --> 00:38:01.306
Nothing should happen to them.
She is always following them.

00:38:01.472 --> 00:38:04.847
One can say: “If She is a ‘person’,
how does She follow them?”

00:38:05.097 --> 00:38:09.764
Because She is
‘omnipresent’.

00:38:10.097 --> 00:38:12.555
She is present
everywhere.

00:38:12.805 --> 00:38:16.264
Everywhere in your
life She is there.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.139
Especially with Sahaja Yogis,
She follows them up and down.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:22.680
Everywhere,

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:24.472
whatever you are doing.
You are in an accident

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.638
She is there to save you.

00:38:26.847 --> 00:38:31.638
She is like an angel behind you
and nothing can happen to you,

00:38:31.847 --> 00:38:35.388
if you really worship Her
from your full heart.

00:38:35.638 --> 00:38:40.388
Not for any gain, not
for any achievement,

00:38:40.597 --> 00:38:44.097
but for Her blessings.

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.346
Her blessings are
very great

00:38:46.555 --> 00:38:51.139
and they really have
enriched human beings.

00:38:51.346 --> 00:38:55.347
They have enriched this Earth.
They have enriched everything,

00:38:55.597 --> 00:38:59.597
because of the
blessings of Mahakali.

00:39:00.306 --> 00:39:02.680
Of course, then, there
comes the Mahalakshmi.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.264
Her thing is that,

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:09.847
in Mahalakshmi principle, you
become ‘sort of detached’.

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:14.680
You start finding that:
“What is this world after all?”

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:17.346
and a kind of a feeling

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:22.680
of detachment comes into you
and you start thinking

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:27.264
that there must be something better,
there must be truth beyond.

00:39:27.513 --> 00:39:30.930
Especially people who have
been tortured by bad people

00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:32.430
always think like that.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.181
That: “There must be someone
who will raise us from this.”

00:39:37.388 --> 00:39:40.597
Here comes the Mahalakshmi
principle in you

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:43.889
which is the principle
of the Goddess

00:39:44.306 --> 00:39:48.555
of ‘Ascent’.

00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:53.638
She puts the ideas in your
head that: “What is next?

00:39:53.847 --> 00:39:58.930
What do we have to do? After all,
is this the end of our life?

00:39:59.181 --> 00:40:03.014
What is the purpose of our life?
Why have we come on this Earth?

00:40:03.264 --> 00:40:07.388
What is so special that we
should live on this Earth?”

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.555
All such fundamental
questions start rising

00:40:10.805 --> 00:40:15.181
and then he just takes
to the seeking.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.889
In that also, you
have to understand

00:40:18.097 --> 00:40:21.347
the Mahalakshmi principle
is very, very,

00:40:21.597 --> 00:40:25.306
very different from what
people understand.

00:40:26.181 --> 00:40:27.972
They think -if
they are seeking,

00:40:28.222 --> 00:40:29.847
it should be intelligible,

00:40:30.056 --> 00:40:32.014
it should be through
their mindsall this…

00:40:32.222 --> 00:40:34.430
or could be rational

00:40:34.638 --> 00:40:36.805
or scientific.

00:40:37.014 --> 00:40:41.097
That’s how they move,
seeking the truth.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.764
It’s not possible!

00:40:44.181 --> 00:40:46.513
Mahalakshmi’s principle
is like this:

00:40:46.722 --> 00:40:49.306
that you should have earnest

00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:53.972
desire to know the Truth and Truth
and Truth – and nothing else.

00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.346
When you think like that,

00:40:56.555 --> 00:40:58.764
then you will not take
to other things.

00:40:58.972 --> 00:41:00.972
So many people took to drugs,

00:41:01.222 --> 00:41:05.346
thinking that, by doing that, they
will achieve their Self-Realisation.

00:41:05.513 --> 00:41:06.930
It’s a wrong idea.

00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:12.139
How can you get away from your awareness?
Can achieve that?

00:41:12.347 --> 00:41:16.597
Awareness is the most
important thing.

00:41:16.847 --> 00:41:19.555
If you can go

00:41:20.181 --> 00:41:23.805
into the realm
of awareness,

00:41:24.056 --> 00:41:28.555
then you have to understand that the
basic awareness is not to be lost.

00:41:28.805 --> 00:41:30.764
If your basic awareness
is lost,

00:41:31.056 --> 00:41:35.346
through drinking or through drugs
or all these things that people do.

00:41:35.513 --> 00:41:38.597
They think that they are seeking,
that’s why they are doing.

00:41:38.805 --> 00:41:45.014
So sometimes they take excuse of
‘seeking’ to do wrong things.

00:41:45.555 --> 00:41:49.097
It’s like a revenge on
your Self, I think,

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:51.056
that you want
to revenge yourself

00:41:51.264 --> 00:41:55.889
by thinking that you
are now ‘seeking’.

00:41:56.139 --> 00:41:58.181
It’s not the real seeking.

00:41:58.347 --> 00:42:03.346
In a real seeking, a person
has to just meditate

00:42:03.555 --> 00:42:06.847
and should find out
what is the right way.

00:42:07.097 --> 00:42:09.680
But, that too, not by
reading some books

00:42:09.889 --> 00:42:12.430
or listening to
some false gurus.

00:42:12.638 --> 00:42:16.930
Actually, Kundalini
awakening is the only way

00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:20.638
one can know the Reality.
There’s no other way out.

00:42:20.889 --> 00:42:24.930
But nobody tells them that
it is Kundalini awakening.

00:42:25.222 --> 00:42:27.056
They’ll tell you:
“We’ll go to this place,

00:42:27.306 --> 00:42:29.555
then to that place,
then more to that place.

00:42:29.805 --> 00:42:31.056
Then this has
to be done…

00:42:31.306 --> 00:42:34.472
And, ultimately, where do
you come? Where you started!

00:42:34.972 --> 00:42:39.097
Just like that: moving
from places to places.

00:42:39.346 --> 00:42:42.555
Moving from false

00:42:42.805 --> 00:42:46.764
to another false, to another
false,… to falsehood.

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:50.388
Ultimately so many
seekers have been lost.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.139
So many have been
lost, because

00:42:54.597 --> 00:43:00.722
they thought that certain
type of… is very precious,

00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:02.680
seeking is very ‘precious’,

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.264
because you can pay lots
of money to the guru.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.388
I mean, you can
‘purchase’ the guru.

00:43:08.638 --> 00:43:12.181
And so: “All the rich people
can become enlightened.”

00:43:12.346 --> 00:43:13.513
That means that.

00:43:13.722 --> 00:43:18.930
But I don’t think that the percent-
age of good people are only rich.

00:43:19.181 --> 00:43:21.346
The people who are

00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:25.847
good are good. Whether they are
rich or not is not the point.

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:29.764
But such people try to
gather round a person,

00:43:29.972 --> 00:43:33.889
because, I think, there’s a
subtle ego of their money,

00:43:34.139 --> 00:43:37.513
that: “We can afford to
buy this, buy that.”

00:43:38.014 --> 00:43:42.472
Once I was in America and there
was one lady who came to see Me

00:43:42.722 --> 00:43:46.930
and she didn’t know that I
was… a spiritual person.

00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:51.597
So she said: “Now there’s a very
good guru who has come to America.”

00:43:51.889 --> 00:43:53.430
I said: “Really?
What does he do?

00:43:53.722 --> 00:43:57.264
She said: “There’s a sale
on.” I said: “Really?”

00:43:57.555 --> 00:44:00.847
“You can pay him
half the amount:

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:04.347
he can give you his blessings.
Alright?”

00:44:04.597 --> 00:44:09.056
Then next week, she said: “Now
the sale has come to one fourth.

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.555
If you pay the one
fourth amount,

00:44:11.764 --> 00:44:14.222
then he will give you
the ‘full’ knowledge.”

00:44:14.388 --> 00:44:17.014
I said: “How can
it be reciprocal?

00:44:17.222 --> 00:44:19.388
It’s not proportionate!”
I said:

00:44:19.638 --> 00:44:22.764
“You were giving half,
he was giving you half,

00:44:22.972 --> 00:44:25.014
and when you are giving
one-fourth, he is giving you full.”

00:44:25.264 --> 00:44:26.889
“That’s the thing”
she said,

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:31.264
“he’s very magnanimous, you see.
That’s the point.”

00:44:31.764 --> 00:44:36.764
I said: “For all such people who
think they can purchase Truth,

00:44:37.014 --> 00:44:41.346
they cannot achieve it.
You cannot purchase it.

00:44:42.139 --> 00:44:46.430
You cannot pay for your
Kundalini awakening. No!

00:44:46.764 --> 00:44:49.597
Nor you should take any
payment for that.

00:44:49.847 --> 00:44:55.513
Self-Realisation is
absolutely the Divine Grace.

00:44:55.805 --> 00:44:59.722
And you cannot take
money for that.

00:45:00.513 --> 00:45:04.555
You cannot sell it. It’s not
so ‘cheap’ to be sold.

00:45:04.847 --> 00:45:10.181
If you understand that, then
the Mahalakshmi power works.

00:45:10.513 --> 00:45:12.388
And Mahalakshmi power is

00:45:12.638 --> 00:45:15.889
really meant for people who
are really genuine seekers,

00:45:16.181 --> 00:45:21.264
who are really seeking genuinely.
It acts and works so well,

00:45:21.513 --> 00:45:26.638
that they achieve a
kind of a very, very

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:30.056
spontaneous Realisation.

00:45:30.513 --> 00:45:34.513
This spontaneous Realisation,
you all have got it.

00:45:34.805 --> 00:45:38.847
You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You
don’t have to do anything like that.

00:45:39.056 --> 00:45:43.346
All those things are over.
You have done it.

00:45:43.597 --> 00:45:46.139
In your previous lives,
you must have done it.

00:45:46.346 --> 00:45:47.889
Now you don’t have
to do anything.

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:52.222
You can get it, you are getting
it just sitting down here.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.722
Wherever you are in the
whole world, you can get it

00:45:55.972 --> 00:45:57.847
and it is spreading
very fast.

00:45:58.056 --> 00:46:04.388
Now, it’s also the duty of Sahaja
Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:05.388 --> 00:46:09.346
Now, this one is

00:46:09.555 --> 00:46:13.680
to be understood: that
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali

00:46:14.014 --> 00:46:17.764
both go hand in hand.

00:46:18.014 --> 00:46:22.264
When, you see,
Mahakali blesses you

00:46:22.472 --> 00:46:26.014
and She is with you and
you are in Her realm,

00:46:26.222 --> 00:46:28.139
the Mahalakshmi comes
forward

00:46:28.346 --> 00:46:32.056
and She definitely helps you
to achieve your Realisation

00:46:32.306 --> 00:46:36.597
and also to improve
your problems,

00:46:36.805 --> 00:46:40.764
to help you. I mean - the financial
side of it, you can call it,

00:46:41.014 --> 00:46:42.722
or in any way other

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.056
problems also She solves. The
greatest problem She solves

00:46:47.264 --> 00:46:52.972
that your greatest desire to achieve
Self-Realisation, is granted.

00:46:53.388 --> 00:46:56.472
So, there is no competition
between Them.

00:46:56.764 --> 00:47:00.306
All these three powers
work together,

00:47:00.513 --> 00:47:04.346
and, whatever is needed,
they work it out.

00:47:04.597 --> 00:47:10.222
But it is the Mahakali who
guides where what help has to go

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:15.722
and that’s why the power of
Mahakali is very much respected.

00:47:15.972 --> 00:47:22.388
As it is, She has killed so many
devils and so many rakshasas

00:47:22.638 --> 00:47:26.346
and there are still more –
some of them are existing

00:47:26.513 --> 00:47:28.638
but I am sure they
will be all finished.

00:47:28.847 --> 00:47:34.513
There will be none of these
horrible ones ever existing.

00:47:34.764 --> 00:47:39.264
But still we have to be
very careful and alert

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:42.930
and try to find out what’s
wrong with these people.

00:47:43.139 --> 00:47:48.222
What are they doing and what
they trying to propagate?

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:52.346
You must mature in
such a manner that

00:47:52.555 --> 00:47:57.680
you should know everything
of all these evil doers.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.764
You must find out what these
false people are doing.

00:48:01.972 --> 00:48:05.889
See, it’s really easy, because
you are enlightened.

00:48:06.139 --> 00:48:10.222
And with your enlightened attention,
you can definitely find out

00:48:10.388 --> 00:48:14.930
what’s wrong with
what organisation,

00:48:15.181 --> 00:48:19.222
with each evil man,
evildoer.

00:48:19.388 --> 00:48:22.805
It will be… the best
way is to meditate.

00:48:23.014 --> 00:48:24.972
Not to be aggressive
in any way.

00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:29.889
But just to meditate and
ask Mahakali: “Destroy!

00:48:30.181 --> 00:48:34.430
Destroy him, for he is destroying
the world. You please destroy him!”

00:48:34.638 --> 00:48:36.889
That’s Her job and
She’d love to do it,

00:48:37.097 --> 00:48:39.889
but somebody has to
tell Her and ask Her.

00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:43.264
It’s very good, because
there are so many,

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.805
that unless and until
you point it out,

00:48:46.056 --> 00:48:49.264
She may not be able to put Her
attention to that - possibly.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:53.930
So it’s best is always
ask Her to help you.

00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:57.722
On individual basis.
On a national basis.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:02.680
Maybe on a collective basis
or maybe on a global basis.

00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:07.972
That’s what. She exists everywhere.
She is globally available.

00:49:08.222 --> 00:49:10.222
Anywhere: you may
be having

00:49:10.388 --> 00:49:15.139
any colour, any race,
any nation - anything.

00:49:15.346 --> 00:49:19.014
but She exists within
you all the time.

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:22.722
And to worship Her
and to awaken Her,

00:49:22.972 --> 00:49:26.805
is only ‘your’ due,
that ‘you’ have to do.

00:49:27.014 --> 00:49:30.347
If She is awakened within you,
you’ll be a humble person.

00:49:30.555 --> 00:49:33.181
You will see what mistakes
you have been committing

00:49:33.388 --> 00:49:36.889
and you’ll feel bad about it.
You will not feel ‘guilty’,

00:49:37.139 --> 00:49:38.097
but you will feel ‘bad’,

00:49:38.346 --> 00:49:41.306
that: I will never do such a thing.
I have done very great wrong.

00:49:41.472 --> 00:49:43.764
And then you will
try to correct it.

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:46.430
All this works out

00:49:46.638 --> 00:49:50.347
very well when you are
pure in your heart.

00:49:50.597 --> 00:49:54.764
Your heart should be pure.
If your heart is not pure,

00:49:54.972 --> 00:50:02.222
if you are doing Sahaja Yoga to
have some competition with others

00:50:02.388 --> 00:50:07.430
or with some sort of material
achievements, it will not work out.

00:50:07.805 --> 00:50:13.222
You have to do it in a way
that is an innocent act,

00:50:13.555 --> 00:50:17.014
that you are worshipping your
Mother like a little child

00:50:17.222 --> 00:50:19.056
worships and loves
his mother.

00:50:19.306 --> 00:50:23.139
It’s a very simple relationship,
which all of us have felt,

00:50:23.347 --> 00:50:26.056
how we should love
our Mother and

00:50:26.306 --> 00:50:31.680
how we should be under Her
guidance and under Her protection.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:35.555
That is something very simple you
have known in your childhood

00:50:35.805 --> 00:50:38.680
and that childhood has
to come back in you

00:50:38.889 --> 00:50:41.722
if you really
worship the Mother.

00:50:42.014 --> 00:50:45.181
May God Bless you.
