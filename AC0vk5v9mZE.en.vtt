00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.260
Now, in this also, there are thugs, as I call them. I have no other word to describe them.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.030
They have made a mess of this Kundalini of yours.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.713
If you read some Kundalini book you would not come to my programme.

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:20.243
They think She’s the most ferocious lady ever born.

00:00:20.244 --> 00:00:24.323
Unclear

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:32.659
All sorts of perverted things they have said about this Mother of yours;

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:38.539
while She is the most loving thing that you can ever have.

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:46.279
She is the one who is going to bestow this bliss on you,

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:51.919
while the horrible ones have tried to malign Her,

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.959
to shame Her, insult Her

00:00:54.958 --> 00:01:06.571
and have tried to do such things that it's insulting, absolutely a poison.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:16.730
Every time I have to tell you about these ghastly people which I don’t want to talk about,

00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:20.830
because it’s so ugly to talk of these horrible snakes.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.650
But they are there in the garden and I have to tell you..

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.470
I have to warn you all the the time and you have to be very, very careful about them.

00:01:33.607 --> 00:01:44.471
Now, I think this is such a big subject that I don’t know how will I be able to give the complete idea about it.

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:53.697
But so far, I think I have to explain to you, that you have a purpose in life,

00:01:54.491 --> 00:02:04.055
and there are milestones of your evolution placed within you as centres, subtle centres, which you can see with your eyes pulsating

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:13.652
and can feel through the stethoscope. And here is ego and superego within you, which has given you the freedom,

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:18.989
an independent personality and you can act as independent people.

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:26.400
And with this personality, only, you achieve that higher state.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:39.548
And when you achieve that, the manifestation of that Divine Force, through you, starts flowing.

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:45.638
At the end of the day, I would say that you become a hollow personality;

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.880
that you become the real instrument of God, that the power starts flowing through you

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.416
and you see  it flowing and working and you can manoeuvre it.

00:02:55.426 --> 00:03:00.866
Of course, again talking about the snakes: they give you no powers whatsoever

00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:03.286
and take away all the powers you have.

00:03:03.346 --> 00:03:15.232
But the whole Creation has been created, and you have been manifested as human beings to achieve your own powers,

00:03:17.362 --> 00:03:23.185
So there’s a sweet story about Radha and Krishna:

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:31.955
once they say Radha was jealous of Shri Krishna’s flute,

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:40.264
so She went to Krishna and She said, “What is this? All the time you are putting her [the flute] to your lips, I don’t like it.”

00:03:40.284 --> 00:03:43.994
He said, “Why? Are you jealous?” She said, “I am very jealous of her.

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:48.112
What is her speciality? What is so special about her?”

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:52.652
He said, “Why don’t you go and ask her?” He said, “It’s better that you go and ask her.”

00:03:52.752 --> 00:04:04.070
So She went and asked that, “What is your speciality that He’s all the time keeping you near His heart? And all the time He’s using you?”

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:12.161
She laughed aloud and she said, “Do you know what is my speciality? My speciality is that I have no speciality.

00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.151
I have become a hollow person.

00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:20.563
I am absolutely hollow and He plays and the world enjoys and I see the thing flowing through me

00:04:20.573 --> 00:04:27.223
and I just watch all that. And people say that it is the murli, it is the flute, that is playing.

00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:32.499
I just find I am just a hollow personality.”

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.709
So Radha went to Shri Krishna and She said, "All right, next time you make a hollow personality out of me!"

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:45.276
This is what it is! And whatever is promised has to be done, is to be done.

00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:48.066
God never makes promises which He doesn't keep.

00:04:48.132 --> 00:04:54.234
May God bless you all. I hope you all will get Realisation and you will steady it.

00:04:54.234 --> 00:05:00.344
That’s very important, because as I have told you, it's not meant for lousy people.

00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:04.777
Thank you very much. I am so happy to see so many people here,

00:05:04.807 --> 00:05:07.537
who are seekers, who are deep people,

00:05:07.604 --> 00:05:15.824
who have been seeking all their lives and they have to realise that this is the only way it has to be done.

00:05:15.824 --> 00:05:22.936
As I said, I don’t know how people charge money for it:

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:28.288
it’s something ridiculous and it’s very, very low, I mean,

00:05:28.274 --> 00:05:30.814
if you talk about it.

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:36.438
You cannot charge money for your love.

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:41.924
I work in India and they told me, “Mother, can you give us a list of people whom you have cured?”

00:05:42.004 --> 00:05:47.484
I said, “It’s very embarrassing. Don’t ask me such questions!”

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:51.378
They said, “But you must give us the list of people whom you have cured!”

00:05:51.377 --> 00:05:54.388
” I said, “I have never made a list.”

00:05:54.438 --> 00:06:01.427
So he said, “Oh really? Why not?” I said,“Do you make a list of people whom you feed?

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:03.397
Whom you love?

00:06:03.457 --> 00:06:10.233
Whom you give them mercy, to your own children? Do you make a list of all that? How many times you have done washes to your children?

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:15.035
Or you enjoy it so much, where is the time for all these nonsensical things?” Has to be!

00:06:15.045 --> 00:06:19.495
It's very embarrassing I think.

00:06:21.565 --> 00:06:26.731
It is that beautiful way of giving.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.860
unclear

00:06:29.881 --> 00:06:34.575
May God bless you again and again. Let's see now what happens.

00:06:34.575 --> 00:06:36.325
How far you go.

00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:46.942
I would say we will ask some questions, and if you can ask some questions.

00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:57.362
But you should not be very sensitive about it, because people ask me very, very direct questions and when I give them an answer they feel hurt.

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:04.209
And I don’t want to hurt you for anything because you are already very much hurt.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:09.530
I do not want to hurt you. But it happens, and it happens like that,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.067
that you ask funny questions and when I tell you the answer, sometimes you feel hurt.

00:07:16.078 --> 00:07:19.507
So just ask me questions.

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:26.563
Seeker:  When I go into relaxation I get convulsions in the abdominal area.

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:29.245
How can that be relaxation my child?

00:07:29.243 --> 00:07:30.915
Just tell me.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.935
How can that be if there are convulsions? It's a sickness. It's a possession.

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:40.470
Have you seen possessed people?

00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:43.500
They get the same thing.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.560
When they are possessed they get the same thing.

00:07:48.684 --> 00:07:57.584
They feel relaxed because somebody else has taken their responsibility, but physically they can’t bear the pressure and they have contortions.

00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:02.378
It’s very easy to find out:

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.988
you must be having lots of lunatic asylums here,

00:08:05.058 --> 00:08:07.978
you can go and see them, when they are possessed how they behave.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:16.714
Say, epilepsy is one of them. If you have seen in epilepsy how people get into a kind of a posture

00:08:16.804 --> 00:08:21.476
from where they cannot get out for hours together.

00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:24.506
It is possession.

00:08:26.885 --> 00:08:35.664
It's not only that your stomach will be absolutely relaxed, but you will relax the stomachs of others.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.477
Anybody, please?

00:08:43.484 --> 00:08:45.526
Seeker: Will this take us to God realisation?

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:46.268
I beg your pardon.

00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:48.776
Will this take us to God realisation?

00:08:48.788 --> 00:08:52.398
This Self-realisation, will this take us to God?

00:08:52.796 --> 00:09:00.152
Of course, of course! You see there are some people just arrive there very fast, but some people go through certain stages.

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:07.602
The first stage of Realisation, when the Kundalini crosses over the Agnya Chakra, is called as Thoughtless Awareness.

00:09:08.762 --> 00:09:13.970
Only with this Thoughtless Awareness you can start curing people.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.047
You can cure people if your Kundalini has crossed the Agnya.

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:22.576
That’s how you find many people can cure, but they don't know how they do it, they don't know how to manoeuvre it

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:29.623
And then we have

00:09:29.648 --> 00:09:36.493
the Kundalini rising above the fontanel, which we can call as the time, I call it, as Self-realisation.

00:09:36.573 --> 00:09:41.338
Because that’s the time you become another human being with collective consciousness.

00:09:41.898 --> 00:09:45.002
With that, you can start giving Realisation to others,

00:09:45.102 --> 00:09:49.183
correcting your own chakras, everybody’s chakras, and you can start feeling it.

00:09:49.183 --> 00:09:51.853
So many things will happen. I mean it’s endless.

00:09:51.923 --> 00:09:57.023
I cannot tell you how you realise the bliss of the Divine by that.

00:09:57.103 --> 00:09:59.760
It’s something so wonderful that you will be amazed.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:09.410
We have here one Sahaj Yogi. In the beginning, you know, I had only six of them for four years, for your information, in England.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.140
And I worked with six of them. And one of them in the beginning felt like, “Let’s see how this collective consciousness works!”

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:25.872
So he said, “My father has not written any letter to me.” I said, “All right, you don’t write to him, you just think about him and feel his vibrations.”

00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:31.078
He started getting a heat here and burning here.

00:10:31.076 --> 00:10:35.468
He said, “Mother what does that mean?” I said, “All these centres are of your father.

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:39.308
So you telephone to him and find out. He must be having bronchitis.”

00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:40.758
He had bronchitis.

00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:44.559
But when the fellow talked to him, his bronchitis got all right.

00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:46.950
It's that fantastic.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:55.813
So then, I told you that from Thoughtless Awareness you jump into collective consciousness, collective awareness.

00:10:55.883 --> 00:11:02.202
This collective awareness gives you the powers of collective consciousness by which you cure others.

00:11:02.262 --> 00:11:06.792
Even sitting down here you can cure other people,

00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:13.386
you can awaken their Kundalini, even give them their Self Realisation.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.670
But that person you talk to on the phone should be connected

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:28.241
and that he should know there is a movement by some deliberation of somebody who is, we call, a Sahaj Yogi.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.885
Then the third state is complete Self-realisation.

00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:38.651
That state comes, we call it as Nirvikalpa Samadhi,

00:11:38.705 --> 00:11:44.005
means where there is doubtless awareness, that you have no doubts anymore left about it.

00:11:44.055 --> 00:11:50.945
It's not rational, but it is a state in which  you settle down.

00:11:50.945 --> 00:11:53.755
In that state you have no doubts anymore about it.

00:11:53.825 --> 00:11:56.330
Then the powers are dynamic,

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.270
and you start working on so many dimensions that you are amazed how things work out.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.860
For example, I’ll tell you we have a lady here, I must say she is doubtlessly aware.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:12.076
She doesn’t feel anybody’s chakras or her chakras. All the time her vibrations are flowing.

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:16.780
She wrote a letter to me saying that, “Mother there is a girl who has got cancer,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.066
she is about ten, eleven years of age

00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:21.163
and I don’t know how we can help her.

00:12:21.185 --> 00:12:27.163
She has come all the way from Hong Kong and they are saying that she has to die in about three months time.”

00:12:27.158 --> 00:12:32.360
I said, “All right.” “And she’s now going to America for further check up.”

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.688
So she went to America and the American doctor said, “She has no cancer, nothing.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.650
Who told you she has cancer?”

00:12:43.245 --> 00:12:46.997
This is one of the many times some dynamic things that will happen.

00:12:46.994 --> 00:12:50.424
At first you cannot believe it, it is so fantastic.

00:12:50.484 --> 00:12:53.214
So this is the state of 'doubtless awareness.'

00:12:53.284 --> 00:12:56.827
First the 'thoughtless awareness' then the 'doubtless awareness.'

00:12:56.824 --> 00:13:02.202
Now, the ‘awareness’ word, you see, is,

00:13:02.202 --> 00:13:08.143
in the dream we call it awareness only. Say, now, I say that normally what we are, in conscious mind, is a dream.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.150
So this is also awareness. And even after that is awareness.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.182
But in Sanskrit there are two words: one is ‘buddha’, another is ‘prabuddha’.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.332
If you put ‘pra’, means ‘enlightened’. So we should call it ‘enlightened awareness’.

00:13:21.392 --> 00:13:23.943
So it is thoughtless, enlightened awareness.

00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:28.093
And enlightened awareness is also termed as ‘samadhi’:

00:13:28.153 --> 00:13:35.269
so is ‘nirvichar samadhi’. And the second one is the doubtless, enlightened awareness:

00:13:35.263 --> 00:13:39.576
is the ‘nirvikalpa samadhi’, where there is no vikalpa. (thought)

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.823
Now this also is the term one has to understand, very carefully, what is a ‘nirvikalpa’

00:13:44.847 --> 00:13:47.293
But I think that I will do some other time.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:52.963
And this is what is the Self-realisation. When you have achieved that, then there is God’s realisation starts,

00:13:52.975 --> 00:13:58.128
where you start controlling the nature,

00:13:58.112 --> 00:14:02.808
you start controlling all that you see and you become the master of all that,

00:14:02.818 --> 00:14:10.035
but you do everything for the hita, means the well-being of your own and of the whole.

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:17.478
Your connection with the whole becomes absolutely clear cut, when you become God Realised.

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:24.742
Means your awareness becomes so clear and so much effective

00:14:24.758 --> 00:14:31.288
as if people would say that, “Look at this man! How does he do it? And how it happens?”

00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:39.595
That is the state also responsible. After all the whole Creation has been through Sahaja – spontaneous.

00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:43.544
And in the same way this is also spontaneous.

00:14:43.564 --> 00:14:50.324
There are only two persons, though they were born to incarnations, who were Divine,

00:14:50.345 --> 00:14:58.570
and who became themselves incarnations. They were born as human beings but became themselves incarnations.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:06.396
But even that gap can be covered. Why not?

00:15:06.403 --> 00:15:13.423
Mother you also say that there are many yogic people teaching the wrong things in the Himalayas.

00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:15.992
Why does God allow this?

00:15:15.982 --> 00:15:21.062
He doesn’t allow. You allow. I have told you, you have the freedom to choose.

00:15:21.062 --> 00:15:24.604
First thing you should know: a man who takes money, how can that be near God?

00:15:24.624 --> 00:15:28.344
You remember, you have Christ before you.

00:15:28.354 --> 00:15:32.640
You know he took one whip and whipped these people in the church.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.388
A man like him who said that, “Forgive them for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:44.184
He whipped those people. That’s what they deserved, and you went to them and bowed to them.

00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:47.764
While you are all very intelligent people

00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:55.260
and why such intelligent people are being attracted to this kind of a nonsense and an absurd thing?

00:15:55.263 --> 00:16:01.992
While poor simple uneducated are better off. They know, “Oh we understand all that!”

00:16:02.013 --> 00:16:05.864
They are not stupid.

00:16:05.884 --> 00:16:11.351
You must understand, when you have money, all such thugs are going to come down here.

00:16:11.407 --> 00:16:14.117
I’ll take the other position now, let’s see:

00:16:14.112 --> 00:16:21.487
supposing somebody comes out of the jail,
in India, he has no social position.

00:16:25.337 --> 00:16:29.081
He cannot live socially well.

00:16:29.092 --> 00:16:35.421
So he says, “All right, let me take another form,” or “let me have a drama.”

00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:39.622
He makes a camouflage out of it.

00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:48.338
He makes a person who is very saintly – oh, very poor – now he greets you with (unclear)

00:16:48.338 --> 00:16:51.959
Or he may even master some other power, makes no difference.

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:59.928
Then he comes out. He says, “You see, I will show you the water will come out of the earth, just now.”

00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:04.858
Previous night he might've found out that there might be a pipeline there,

00:17:04.879 --> 00:17:13.201
and he must have put some sort of a cloth there,

00:17:13.201 --> 00:17:17.613
and which he must have picked up and shown you that the water is coming out.

00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:26.425
And people will say, “Oh, this is a great miracle! He hit there and the water has started coming!”

00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:32.813
So the sensible person has to go from the back door and see how he lives.

00:17:32.803 --> 00:17:38.111
And see about the pipeline.

00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:40.961
You should be on the alert.

00:17:40.973 --> 00:17:48.341
This alertness, if you do not keep in spirituality... even after Realisation

00:17:48.365 --> 00:17:51.645
you have to be alert about your attention.

00:17:51.655 --> 00:17:56.908
First the alertness is about others, but after Realisation the alertness is about you,

00:17:56.965 --> 00:18:03.675
because within you there are thieves who have come inside you, so you have to watch that.

00:18:03.699 --> 00:18:09.569
But you people are so simple and so innocent

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.317
And I really don’t want to even blame your freedom for it

00:18:13.327 --> 00:18:19.587
because they did a good job of it, no doubt about it.

00:18:22.196 --> 00:18:30.332
May I ask one? If you get Realisation, one raises the Kundalini, gets Realisation.

00:18:30.346 --> 00:18:33.864
Do you have to repeat that or is once enough?

00:18:33.896 --> 00:18:38.586
Yah, yah. You have to. You see with some people it just goes and goes down.

00:18:38.598 --> 00:18:47.285
One horrible guru we have in India. I don’t know what he does.  You raise the Kundalini, you bring it up and it again sucks back.

00:18:47.306 --> 00:18:50.016
Again you bring it up and again it is sucked back.

00:18:50.015 --> 00:18:54.695
Oh, you don’t know how much one has to work hard. With some people it is not.

00:18:54.706 --> 00:19:03.650
But one has to work hard, morning till evening the whole night. Last night I think we slept about 2.30.

00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:10.024
Oh, it's a terrible job, it has to be done.

00:19:09.994 --> 00:19:12.904
But there is no guarantee about it.

00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:20.536
Now, you will understand one thing, very simple it is, because you are coming from a different experience,

00:19:20.544 --> 00:19:23.776
but here nothing is selling,

00:19:23.767 --> 00:19:26.266
nothing is guaranteed.

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:33.357
It’s the whim that you get your Realisation. It’s God’s whim that He gives you Realisation.

00:19:33.362 --> 00:19:36.847
It’s in complete freedom that He sits there.

00:19:36.857 --> 00:19:41.787
You cannot overpower His freedom, because He’s not seeking elections.

00:19:41.814 --> 00:19:45.206
You are to be elected.

00:19:45.188 --> 00:19:51.478
It’s the other way round towards Him,  you see? So there is no guarantee of anything.

00:19:51.503 --> 00:19:55.507
Do you understand such a situation?

00:19:55.508 --> 00:20:17.093
We desire it, we have to desire it, for God. And we go to a guru and perhaps our guru... (unclear)

00:20:17.104 --> 00:20:28.355
discernment , our rationalisation, our alertness, isn't as acute as it should be.

00:20:28.348 --> 00:20:39.451
How can these people, these men, continue and speak of God in such glowing terms, such heightened terms?

00:20:39.464 --> 00:20:43.524
They have no Kundalini, they have no Spirit.

00:20:43.541 --> 00:20:46.681
They have achieved there doom a long time back.

00:20:46.706 --> 00:20:54.049
You see, a person who is absolutely shameless, what can you do about it?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.530
They do not want their ascent.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:08.380
As the story is there were some monkeys playing, and one of the monkey’s tail was cut,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.388
so he wanted everybody’s tail to be cut.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:18.870
That is their attitude: they want everybody's tail to be cut!

00:21:18.866 --> 00:21:25.151
Only thing that you can do is not to have anything to do with them.

00:21:27.924 --> 00:21:33.806
How then do we know an authentic person who will take you to God?

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:38.696
How do we know? Because if a person makes you authentic, that person is definitely authentic!

00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:50.065
You can see very clearly, you see, when they say, “We’ll give you these powers and this.” You cannot manoeuvre them!

00:21:50.067 --> 00:21:53.942
You cannot understand them, you do not even have the know-how!

00:21:53.952 --> 00:22:00.756
You see, how do I say you are an authentic engineer? Because you know engineering. All right?

00:22:00.806 --> 00:22:02.601
That’s how you are authentic.

00:22:02.601 --> 00:22:09.586
If you do not know how to do anything, how are you authentic? So the one who gives you the authenticity itself, is authentic.

00:22:09.598 --> 00:22:21.358
If he has given you the powers, by which you know the know-hows and you yourself can bestow those powers to others, then you can say it is authentic, isn't it.

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:23.029
Oh you all know all about it!

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:27.059
I’ll tell you what happens. Now, I’ll tell you what it is.

00:22:27.069 --> 00:22:28.869
Why it has happened, I will tell you.

00:22:28.888 --> 00:22:32.696
You see, they are Greek so they have to be translated.

00:22:32.694 --> 00:22:38.578
Don’t get upset about it. What has happened really? Should I tell you?

00:22:38.558 --> 00:22:50.217
Now, the thing that has happened is that you developed your societies, you developed your countries and you became developed countries.

00:22:50.232 --> 00:22:58.282
You developed your brains also too much, and the whole thing was the Right Side movement as we call it:

00:22:58.284 --> 00:23:04.706
too much mental activities. You started analysing everything. You thought you can analyse everything, you can do everything.

00:23:04.731 --> 00:23:07.144
And you developed too much of ego.

00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:17.988
We can say about fifty years back the ego of say a British person, was so great that it was pushing all the superego on one side.

00:23:17.986 --> 00:23:24.538
But then the suppression became painful and hurting you.

00:23:24.554 --> 00:23:29.783
So the other people who followed them, they tried to push it back again.

00:23:29.794 --> 00:23:35.054
All right? They said, “No, this is too much of ego, we just can’t bear it, it’s colossal!

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:40.321
They are a bit too egoistical.” So they started pushing their superego too much.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.793
Now when you start doing that, what happens,

00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:55.040
that the wobbling starts in your brain and you are not sure as to whether it was ego or superego, in your brain, you could not understand.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.152
This was the first beginning.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:04.732
Then the war broke out, Hitler came in and he broke your families,

00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:11.088
he broke your values in something sublime and supreme.

00:24:11.097 --> 00:24:20.551
All these things happened. Then people like Freud and all that came in to give you another kind of thoughts which also destroyed you

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:28.585
Now you were in uncertain conditions, and uncertain thinking. You were basically in that position.

00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:39.483
So when something came from a foreign country, about which you had no knowledge, an ignorance, you thought, “Better not think about it because by thinking what have we done?

00:24:39.483 --> 00:24:46.893
By thinking we have invaded other countries. By thinking we have ruined our families. By thinking we have done. So better not think about it, let’s accept it.

00:24:46.893 --> 00:24:49.508
Whatever they say, let’s accept it.”

00:24:49.498 --> 00:25:01.252
And when they came out with great words like ‘peace of the world’,  ‘a domain of this and that’ you just were charmed.

00:25:01.257 --> 00:25:04.121
But naturally.

00:25:04.137 --> 00:25:14.775
Then I would say, that you are the right people, you are the people.

00:25:14.783 --> 00:25:19.385
You are those supreme people who have been selected by these thugs,

00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:24.500
because now you know all the methods of the thug and you are not going to go more in that.

00:25:24.492 --> 00:25:31.265
This is for the immunity to be developed within you, that you had to go there. And there’s nothing to fear,

00:25:31.265 --> 00:25:37.252
because Your Mother is quite capable.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:42.280
You are the ones crucified for others, because you could only do that

00:25:42.294 --> 00:25:46.800
It was only your strength that could bear it out.

00:25:46.814 --> 00:25:50.414
It was nice that strong flowers were taken out.

00:25:50.441 --> 00:25:58.946
If they were just very weak flowers you would have been finished!

00:25:58.944 --> 00:26:03.167
So you had to play that role. Why worry about it?

00:26:03.194 --> 00:26:10.179
We are going to work it out, so don’t worry about the past. You are masters.

00:26:10.182 --> 00:26:12.682
Doesn’t matter.

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:22.625
Moreover you will be surprised: unless and until human beings go through such experiences, they do not come to Sahaja Yoga also.

00:26:22.635 --> 00:26:31.387
Do you know, these boys wanted me to go to Brighton, I said, “Right! You go to Brighton, then I’ll join! Not now!”

00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:34.050
Because I have been to Brighton, I know what sort of a place it is.

00:26:34.048 --> 00:26:44.107
And I don’t know, but poor things, they accepted it, and went down to Brighton. And not a single soul came to the programme.

00:26:44.128 --> 00:26:49.465
But there’s another horrible one there, which they are all jumping, shouting.

00:26:49.494 --> 00:26:55.835
They are increasing in sizes so much, that they  have to now take another place and another place,

00:26:55.856 --> 00:27:02.161
and it’s going on there, so let them go through that. What am I to do? I cannot force you.

00:27:02.181 --> 00:27:06.463
You know, I started my work in 1970,

00:27:06.463 --> 00:27:19.203
actually, but with one person. In this England, for four years, I worked with six people as I told you.

00:27:19.208 --> 00:27:22.898
So, it's alright.

00:27:22.923 --> 00:27:29.476
Most of them, even, they come in a big group sometimes. Yesterday for example we went down to another place,

00:27:29.478 --> 00:27:34.668
and most of them who were there, most of them except two or three, they were sick with something,

00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:46.604
so I was improving their throats and one lady was having epilepsy, another was having another problem and I was just improving them.

00:27:46.604 --> 00:27:53.235
So you are the ones which are described, what we call the real value.

00:27:53.263 --> 00:27:58.237
So what does it matter? Nothing has gone wrong with you.

00:27:58.213 --> 00:28:02.042
Not to feel very down.

00:28:02.032 --> 00:28:07.582
I’ll do it very carefully. You won’t be hurt at all.

00:28:07.594 --> 00:28:15.504
You are going to get the whole of it, and all the secrets, all the secrets.

00:28:15.504 --> 00:28:24.769
And you are going to master this art and you are going to change the whole world, don't you worry.

00:28:24.775 --> 00:28:29.216
You will know your powers very soon, how dynamic you are.

00:28:29.223 --> 00:28:34.563
So don’t get upset about it, and don’t harbour about the past.

00:28:34.566 --> 00:28:39.853
Somebody has to build the road.

00:28:39.878 --> 00:28:46.671
It’s nice they chose such strong children of mine.

00:28:46.673 --> 00:28:55.394
I am very happy that they did not put their hands on the crippled ones.

00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:58.939
So there’s nothing to worry about.  All right?

00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:04.301
May God bless you.

00:29:04.302 --> 00:29:11.671
What's that? Are there any other questions? No?

00:29:11.656 --> 00:29:14.636
Can you explain what we have been told about karma?

00:29:14.648 --> 00:29:20.928
Karma? All right. That, I must explain to you. This is another story.

00:29:20.937 --> 00:29:26.761
But where did they get it I don’t know, that “You have done your karmas, you must cleanse it.”

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:35.741
Then why are they there? How about they do it? These are the sweepers, why don’t they sweep all the dirt?

00:29:35.756 --> 00:29:41.970
Why should we clean the dirt? You are paying them! You have paid for it.

00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:52.299
Who does the karma? Do you know that? The ego does the karma.

00:29:53.987 --> 00:29:57.467
Do the animals feel that they have done any karmas?

00:29:57.492 --> 00:30:04.107
They do not accumulate any filth. Why do we accumulate our karmas? Because our ego is there.

00:30:04.106 --> 00:30:10.162
Because you feel “I am doing it.” All right?

00:30:10.162 --> 00:30:13.706
But you don’t do anything actually, you know.

00:30:13.698 --> 00:30:20.622
I tell a story about some villagers going on an aeroplane, and they were told not to carry too much luggage,

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:25.994
so they were very cautious. When they sat down, they took all their luggage and put it on their heads.

00:30:26.016 --> 00:30:30.891
People said, “Why?” They said, “You see we don’t want the aeroplane to carry too much luggage.”

00:30:30.913 --> 00:30:40.379
In the same way you are carrying your karmas! It is absurd!

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:45.456
It’s only your ego that does the karmas. When your ego falls down, when you are opened out,

00:30:45.528 --> 00:30:49.692
you do not do any karmas, you know that you do not do it.

00:30:49.692 --> 00:30:52.192
It’s very nicely explained in the Geeta.

00:30:52.171 --> 00:30:54.833
Because these people have not told you anything about it.

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:57.806
It’s so clear cut,

00:30:57.793 --> 00:31:01.816
that the karmas become akarmas when you get Realisation.

00:31:01.804 --> 00:31:04.304
Gyan, what is gyana is awareness.

00:31:04.315 --> 00:31:10.576
When the awareness is enlightened then you become prabuddha.

00:31:10.605 --> 00:31:15.503
That means your ego falls off on both the sides.

00:31:15.508 --> 00:31:17.810
Ego is no more there.

00:31:17.813 --> 00:31:26.006
The myth of doing karma is finished.

00:31:26.015 --> 00:31:28.546
And these people play on that myth

00:31:28.552 --> 00:31:32.454
by saying, “All right, you are carrying this luggage?

00:31:32.447 --> 00:31:39.429
Now you better carry even the aeroplane on your heads!"

00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:43.835
You better put all these aeroplanes on their heads.

00:31:43.863 --> 00:31:47.065
And their karmas, who is going to cleanse them?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.301
Have they thought of it?

00:31:52.304 --> 00:32:01.974
They are talking about your karmas, but what about their karmas?

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:05.944
Karma is a myth, as long as you are in a myth

00:32:05.959 --> 00:32:11.475
For example in a dream you are running fast to save yourself from the police.

00:32:11.482 --> 00:32:17.875
You are running fast, you cannot find a ladder, you find half of it and you jump onto this and jump onto that.

00:32:17.896 --> 00:32:22.970
When the dream is over, if I tell you, “Now, better you jump!”

00:32:22.968 --> 00:32:25.468
You will say, “Oh, the dream is over!”

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.708
Instead of awakening you,

00:32:30.727 --> 00:32:35.965
if I say, “All right, run, run, run. Still the police is after you!"

00:32:35.965 --> 00:32:40.148
Then the police will catch hold of them, those police.

00:32:42.713 --> 00:32:49.188
It’s all mythical. It’s said very clearly that it becomes akarma.

00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:54.997
Like the sun giving you the rays;

00:32:54.977 --> 00:32:58.848
does it do any work? No it just emits you see, it just emits.

00:32:58.881 --> 00:33:06.788
Like people say, “Mother you must be very much working hard.” But no, you see, it just emits.

00:33:06.798 --> 00:33:10.387
I don’t do any work, nothing, it just emits.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.057
That's my nature.

00:33:12.067 --> 00:33:15.257
It just flows.

00:33:15.256 --> 00:33:18.428
Some say, “Mother, how can we return it back.”

00:33:18.448 --> 00:33:22.358
Like we had one girl, she said, “Mother I know very good how to massage your feet.”

00:33:22.368 --> 00:33:24.388
I said, “All right, come along. Do it.”

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:31.075
She started massaging my feet and her feet became relaxed and she felt relaxed and she felt like sleeping.

00:33:31.077 --> 00:33:35.315
So she said, “What’s this Mother?” I said, “This is what it is!”

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.398
Because I don’t do anything.

00:33:37.416 --> 00:33:41.399
Absolutely a lazy person!

00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:43.789
Just sitting down!

00:33:43.796 --> 00:33:47.218
It just emits, it just flows, it works.

00:33:47.205 --> 00:33:51.438
Like the sun’s rays come and change the whole world,

00:33:51.438 --> 00:33:55.765
the chlorophyll is created,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:00.247
but the sun doesn’t say, “I do it. I have done this.”

00:34:00.247 --> 00:34:04.157
This is exactly what happens to you when you get Realisation,

00:34:04.155 --> 00:34:09.466
the vibrations start flowing, then you say, “Mother it is not rising.”

00:34:09.475 --> 00:34:16.436
You never say, “I am not doing it.” “It is not coming, it is not working.” You talk in the third person.

00:34:16.425 --> 00:34:23.136
You never talk in your own way that, “I have not done it. I have not achieved it.”

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:25.992
“I have given Realisation.” You never say that!

00:34:26.005 --> 00:34:30.462
You say, “He is not realised.” Now, your own son is there, he is not realised,

00:34:30.462 --> 00:34:34.125
You say, "You know Mother, it's not working. What to do?"

00:34:34.136 --> 00:34:38.155
So the karmas, whatever are done,

00:34:38.162 --> 00:34:40.959
are not felt, so where is the phala (फल: fruit) about it,

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.509
what is the fruit about it? Nothing!

00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:49.063
I will have to give you another lecture on Geeta, I think, then you will understand

00:34:49.063 --> 00:34:54.385
that you do not do any karmas and there are no phalas about it.

00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:56.953
It is just a myth.

00:34:56.952 --> 00:35:04.807
And this is what Shri Krishna wanted you to realise, so He played His diplomacy.

00:35:04.807 --> 00:35:09.465
And I will tell you about His tricks, because I am the only one who knows.

00:35:09.456 --> 00:35:13.017
Then you will all know about His tricks:

00:35:13.012 --> 00:35:19.021
that you don’t do any karmas, so there is no phala about it.

00:35:19.009 --> 00:35:22.231
But when you are in the dream you cannot say this.

00:35:22.232 --> 00:35:28.031
When you are awakened then you just feel, you say, “No it’s not going. It’s not coming. It's not working.

00:35:28.031 --> 00:35:31.962
It doesn't work out. It's not solved.

00:35:31.958 --> 00:35:35.735
Today before coming here I went to see a cancer patient.

00:35:35.742 --> 00:35:38.775
Her own daughter was saying, “Mother no, it’s not flowing.

00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:41.275
Still it’s not coming up. It’s the left catching, the right catching.

00:35:41.268 --> 00:35:42.806
This side and that.”

00:35:42.796 --> 00:35:47.266
And the lady herself has touched Realisation. She was saying, “Yes, Mother, still my left is bad.”

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.770
She herself was saying so.

00:35:52.024 --> 00:35:58.678
So they say, “That is left, that is right, that is front, that is another one.”

00:35:58.688 --> 00:36:03.858
Like the children say. If you take a child and say, “Now, will you go home?”

00:36:03.843 --> 00:36:06.395
So they say, “This boy will not go!”

00:36:06.381 --> 00:36:11.688
That means they are different from ‘this boy’: “This boy will not go.”

00:36:11.695 --> 00:36:13.738
They speak in third person.

00:36:13.745 --> 00:36:17.015
In the same way you also speak in the third person.

00:36:17.015 --> 00:36:23.355
The whole thing becomes akarma.

00:36:23.352 --> 00:36:29.845
So the myth has to break, the dream has to dissolve.

00:36:29.822 --> 00:36:33.582
Does that mean there is no reincarnation?

00:36:34.653 --> 00:36:37.153
How can you say that?

00:36:37.164 --> 00:36:41.585
“There is no karma, there is no reincarnation,” all these are their ideas, nonsense.

00:36:41.593 --> 00:36:43.555
They talk like that.

00:36:43.563 --> 00:36:47.755
Then why did Krishna Himself reincarnate so many times on this Earth?

00:36:47.743 --> 00:36:51.958
Did he have any karmas? He was Yogeshwara himself.

00:36:51.968 --> 00:36:59.348
You should ask them, “Why did He reincarnate?

00:37:01.765 --> 00:37:03.753
Did He not?”

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:12.753
He came as a fish, then He came as this and that and that, and then He came as Rama, Parashurama, and then He came as Shri Krishna.

00:37:12.762 --> 00:37:15.016
Why?

00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:16.783
How?

00:37:16.783 --> 00:37:25.713
Because He, at least, was beyond karmas.

00:37:25.713 --> 00:37:29.413
Actually I would explain that, how it works out,

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:33.205
and you will all understand, this is all Right Side activities

00:37:33.205 --> 00:37:40.286
that, when the whole machinery was set up, the whole office was set up, you can say,

00:37:40.277 --> 00:37:44.990
there had to be some officers appointed.

00:37:44.981 --> 00:37:54.986
So the people were selected out of their good deeds and good behaviour.

00:37:54.976 --> 00:38:01.212
They were made into Gods and were put permanently into places to act as officers.

00:38:01.189 --> 00:38:05.885
Like you have an officer here who will allow you to come inside the hall.

00:38:05.885 --> 00:38:11.569
A public place, or you can say, a public office, has got officers appointed.

00:38:11.578 --> 00:38:15.289
But you are the people who are going to be received, you see.

00:38:15.302 --> 00:38:19.558
For example, the queen has to come, so you appoint somebody, you see to the coach,

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:24.598
another one is appointed to see to the laying of the red carpet.

00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:29.478
Then third is appointed with the flower bouquet there, standing.

00:38:29.478 --> 00:38:37.390
And when the queen comes they are positioned in their places. They need not reincarnate.

00:38:37.385 --> 00:38:40.882
But you are to enter into the hall. You have to come onto the stage.

00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:44.912
It is you for whom all these permanent fixtures were created.

00:38:44.909 --> 00:38:47.855
Why do you want to become permanent fixtures there?

00:38:47.837 --> 00:38:50.337
We have had enough of them.

00:38:51.191 --> 00:38:56.525
Who’s going to come on the stage? Who is going to be adorned?

00:38:56.522 --> 00:38:59.022
We are in the central path.

00:38:59.986 --> 00:39:04.474
They are all settled on the right hand side and  left hand side.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.854
They are called ‘ganas’ on the left hand side and on the right...

00:39:08.839 --> 00:39:10.244
BREAK IN RECORDING.

00:39:10.255 --> 00:39:11.934
.... why this universe was created?

00:39:11.939 --> 00:39:16.921
Why all these elements were created and then Gods were created? Why?

00:39:16.925 --> 00:39:26.863
All these chiranjeevas (चिरञ्जीव) were created: those who achieved the state of permanence, the chiranjeevas are.

00:39:26.853 --> 00:39:35.938
Why? Just to evolve you.

00:39:35.952 --> 00:39:36.985
Alright?

00:39:36.996 --> 00:39:44.034
Which are the other myth they have given you?

00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:48.886
Can you talk a bit more on ego?

00:39:48.885 --> 00:39:53.276
It seems that the ego is the main problem.

00:39:53.276 --> 00:39:55.776
You have to go beyond that.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:40:00.174
No, no, no! It’s not ego, it can be both. My child it could be ego or a superego.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.384
You see actually nowadays it is more superego. You will be surprised.

00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:07.938
Like you are saying going beyond the ego.

00:40:07.947 --> 00:40:12.688
No. Not only ego. It could be ego or superego. You see, I’ll tell you how.

00:40:12.688 --> 00:40:17.927
I must tell you about ego and superego so that you will understand.

00:40:17.935 --> 00:40:24.508
An example of ego is that, say, a child is having the milk from the mother:

00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:27.988
in complete joy, the child is,

00:40:28.016 --> 00:40:32.058
and then you remove the child from that joy.

00:40:32.073 --> 00:40:33.271
Then he develops ego.

00:40:33.271 --> 00:40:38.403
He says, “Why have you done it?!!” Then you tell him, “Don’t do like that!”

00:40:38.403 --> 00:40:40.121
Then you develop the superego.

00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:45.883
So the conditionings come through superego. And the ego is the one through which you assert yourself.

00:40:45.883 --> 00:40:50.763
And the super ego is the one through which you receive conditionings.

00:40:50.763 --> 00:40:52.423
So both could be there.

00:40:52.442 --> 00:40:59.188
And with the people who have been to these funny, horrible, people, more is superego than ego I tell you.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.916
I wish they were more egoistical to really slap them nicely on their faces.

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:07.676
But they were not. They were so humble

00:41:07.676 --> 00:41:10.988
to accept them, so they are conditioned, they're more conditioned

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.068
and much more affected by ego than by.....

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.641
affected by their superego than by ego

00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:32.994
We have so many cases of superego nowadays.

00:41:32.994 --> 00:41:40.443
How can we be obstructed?

00:41:40.453 --> 00:41:45.177
You can be if there is anything wrong with your chakras, there is an obstruction.

00:41:45.195 --> 00:41:48.061
But the Kundalini itself looks after it,

00:41:48.063 --> 00:41:50.563
She Herself works it out.

00:41:50.585 --> 00:41:54.661
Then you can get vibrations there by other Sahaj Yogis.

00:41:54.648 --> 00:41:57.148
They can help you. They will have to jolly well help you

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:05.327
because they will feel the obstruction within themselves!

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.418
Unless and until you feel all right, I am not going to feel all right myself:

00:42:09.402 --> 00:42:13.198
whether it is two nights or five nights makes no difference.

00:42:13.198 --> 00:42:16.342
You see because that's what it is.

00:42:16.372 --> 00:42:24.142
I mean otherwise, even if you try to save somebody who is getting drowned, if you think you are doing it for others you are sadly mistaken.

00:42:24.142 --> 00:42:29.792
It is somebody in you who is getting drowned, that's why you are here.
