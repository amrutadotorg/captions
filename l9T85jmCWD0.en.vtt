00:00:03.801 --> 00:00:07.554
But as Kundalini rises, on every center

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:10.854
you start getting the light of that center.

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:15.920
At the first center you get back your innocence,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.920
your eyes become innocent,
your behavior becomes innocent,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.554
you are not filled with lust and greed,

00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:28.654
you don’t look at things with lust and greed,

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:31.920
but you look at things with innocence,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.920
which is a very big thing that people have lost

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.854
and that you get back and such
a person develops many qualities.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:46.154
One of them is that such a person is full of fragrance,

00:00:46.234 --> 00:00:51.920
such a person has a tremendous gravity,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.953
tremendous gravity, and such a
person has tremendous dynamism,

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:02.454
and attraction is a bad word so I don’t want to use it,

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:04.920
but  magnetic.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.854
His magnets is awakened within him,

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:13.920
this is the center of your magnet of the earth.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.920
Such a person develops a tremendous sense of  roads

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.987
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:27.587
he will know where to go. Like
birds, you place birds anywhere

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.554
they know which side is north, south, east, west.

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:35.987
In the same way you also develop your lost innocence

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:41.920
and your magnet within you, by
which you have proper direction;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.920
but the highest of all you develop the proper direction

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.320
to wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.920
You just don’t do stupid things, you just don’t do,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.254
even if you ever try to do it, you will not do it,

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:03.587
because you know it is so stupid, just you don’t do it.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:09.154
I mean it is so simple to be wise than to be stupid,

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:12.920
because if you have to be stupid
you have to go out of the way

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.920
to be stupid and idiotic; but if you want to be

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
normal and wise is the easiest thing to do.

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:25.854
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:31.254
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:33.987
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:39.000
who all the time barking, just
like dogs or beggars in India.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:48.987
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:51.920
who always tries to amuse you,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.920
always tries to say nice things,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.067
always tries to make you feel
happy. The source of such joy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.920
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.454
So this, this centre

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:26.387
that is what we call the Swadishthana centre

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:32.987
is the centre that gives you your future

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:37.888
energy to think of your future, your planning;

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.920
which gives you energy to bring forth

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.987
the manifestation of the physical labor,

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:47.554
of physical exercise or physical work.

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.888
This poor centre has to work for one work:

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:54.000
to convert the fat for the use of the brain.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.920
Now, if one centre which has to do many other things

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.920
starts doing only one work,
all other things are neglected.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.987
As a result of that you develop problems,

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:13.788
because it has to cater to
your liver, to your pancreas,

00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:17.067
to your kidneys, to your spleen,

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:27.987
and once it goes into action for one channelized work

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.387
it gets programmed for it,

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.254
and then it cannot take care of these things.

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:35.920
That’s how you develop a bad liver,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.920
you develop a diabetes,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.920
kidney trouble, blood pressures.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Also you develop a very serious
disease called blood cancer.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.920
When the Kundalini awakens itself,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.254
She makes the centre enlightened

00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:03.387
and the centre itself resumes its normal shape,

00:05:03.467 --> 00:05:07.920
its normal behaviour and its normal condition.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.320
Apart from that it has got a dynamic power

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.920
or manifestation that this one,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
this centre which looks after our attention

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.554
becomes enlightened, and our
attention becomes enlightened,

00:05:28.634 --> 00:05:32.920
and the attention which is enlightened becomes dynamic

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.053
in the sense now, sitting down
here you can pay attention to anyone

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:39.854
– just pay attention, you don’t have to do anything,

00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:41.920
just pay attention to that person,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and you can find out on your fingertips
what’s the matter with the person.

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:54.920
Now this Nabhi itself – or we can call the solar plexus

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.788
or we can say the Navel chakra –

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:06.920
gives us, as soon as the Kundalini rises,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.920
she awakens this and the light when it spreads,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.721
you become religious.

00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:16.387
I don’t have to tell you anything, you just become.

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:20.721
I don’t have to say that you don’t
take drugs. You just don’t take it.

00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:23.920
Overnight I have seen people have given up drugs.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.120
Overnight, alcoholism, overnight, everything.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.754
And they enjoy their virtues.
That’s the best part of it.

00:06:31.834 --> 00:06:34.354
Some people think, “Well then, what is the fun?”

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:42.920
What is this that you take something in
the pub and next day you have hangover?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.920
Here you take something and
next day you are much better off.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.721
It never comes down. It never gives you a reaction.

00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:56.387
It’s not artificial. It’s not intoxicating.

00:06:56.467 --> 00:07:00.987
It is from your nerves it is bubbling out.

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:04.920
So, this is the center which is very important in us

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.868
because most of us have a problem with this center.

00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:18.920
And here we have a capacity, by this center,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.067
that we enjoy our generosity.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:34.454
Now all matter whatever it is –
we are materialistic, materialistic,

00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:37.254
it is a good idea to be materialistic.

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:42.920
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters are,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.920
that you can give it to others
suggesting your love in it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I think that’s the only thing a matter can do.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.920
And in a very special way you can express that love.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.487
For example, somebody likes a particular thing,

00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:04.987
you go all the way to get it

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:11.934
and give that small thing,
very small thing, to the person

00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:15.687
and the joy,

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:18.987
not out of the money that you have spent,

00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:21.920
but the feelings you have expressed

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.320
of knowing what that person would love.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.801
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:44.000
Such lovable, beautiful society you enter into.

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:52.254
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

00:08:52.334 --> 00:08:54.920
He's a very old sahaja yogi, Indian.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.920
He came out of his shop where he was working,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.920
and got into his car. There was
one man sitting with a dagger

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.788
and he hit him with the dagger on the centre heart,

00:09:06.868 --> 00:09:08.920
and this fellow started bleeding.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.320
He said, "I don't know what happened
to me Mother, I got such strength,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.920
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.920
and I took the dagger from him.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.920
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.487
and the fellow ran away.

00:09:26.567 --> 00:09:30.788
But still, I was not worried about my bleeding.

00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:34.920
What I did, I called my colleague,
who was coming out of the car.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.788
I ran after him

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:40.053
and he took me in his car for
half an hour searching that fellow."

00:09:40.133 --> 00:09:42.687
They didn't go to the police.

00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:45.788
And then they went to the
police, the police were surprised,

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:49.920
the whole shirt was full of blood. They said

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.920
nobody would believe, even the police was shocked.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.053
For half an hour we were searching this
fellow, why didn't you come to the police?

00:09:57.133 --> 00:10:02.920
He said, "It would have taken half an hour for you
to come, so we thought better do it ourselves."

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
See the courage!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.953
Then, of course, he was taken
to the hospital and he was alright.

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:15.320
They stitched him up but he's alright.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.987
That is the sign of a person

00:10:18.067 --> 00:10:22.920
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.287
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:37.854
A man who is fearless has nothing to
worry about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:40.187
He's fearless.

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:43.187
Again, I say 'fearless' doesn't mean

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:47.020
that you go on hitting everybody,
saying all kinds of things, no!

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.788
It means that, [if] you are
fearless, anybody who attacks you,

00:10:50.868 --> 00:10:52.953
you can always protect yourself.

00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:57.521
I mean this story I told you,
because this was not a protection

00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:01.788
which was from within, like Goddess protecting them,

00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:04.920
but actually he protected himself.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.587
So? the power had started working through him.

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:15.267
You should allow your mind,
your body, to project these powers.
