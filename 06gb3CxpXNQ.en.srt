1
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,148
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

2
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:17,779
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

3
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:22,124
for different, different purposes.

4
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:35,245
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

5
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,786
who were worshipping the Mother,

6
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:49,209
they found out that what
She has done for us.

7
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:53,811
The other day I told you
the dharma

8
00:07:53,836 --> 00:08:01,381
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

9
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:08,260
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

10
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:13,284
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

11
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:20,620
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

12
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:29,661
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

13
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:33,410
though we are not aware of it.

14
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,303
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

15
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:44,486
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

16
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:51,934
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

17
00:08:54,333 --> 00:09:00,823
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

18
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:10,387
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

19
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:20,673
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

20
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:28,487
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

21
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:35,325
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

22
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:40,196
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

23
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:44,973
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

24
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:52,268
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

25
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:56,617
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

26
00:09:56,642 --> 00:10:02,573
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

27
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:12,641
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

28
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:19,790
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

29
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:24,067
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

30
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:30,734
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

31
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,744
So, the second one She says is:

32
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:41,756
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

33
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:46,170
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

34
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:54,040
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

35
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:57,270
 But, it’s not there.

36
00:10:57,295 --> 00:11:04,326
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

37
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:11,097
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

38
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:13,748
and some present to another one.

39
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:19,460
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

40
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:25,345
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

41
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:34,187
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

42
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:37,947
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

43
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:43,281
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

44
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:47,264
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

45
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:52,841
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

46
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:57,502
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

47
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:02,551
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

48
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:11,850
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

49
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:16,432
These so close to each other.

50
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:24,183
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

51
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:28,653
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

52
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:32,522
if You can go to that country”.

53
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:35,842
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

54
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:41,772
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

55
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:51,934
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

56
00:12:51,959 --> 00:13:00,929
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

57
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:07,089
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

58
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:12,609
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

59
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:20,189
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

60
00:13:20,214 --> 00:13:24,718
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

61
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:29,895
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

62
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,238
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

63
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:40,989
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

64
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,156
Then you must compete with others.

65
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:50,627
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

66
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:58,831
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

67
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:07,285
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

68
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:13,111
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

69
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:16,618
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

70
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:23,177
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

71
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:27,033
Forgiveness from the heart.

72
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:32,397
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

73
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,379
has exploited you, has troubled you,

74
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:41,256
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

75
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:46,909
Do we use that power to forgive?

76
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:58,341
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

77
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:03,557
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

78
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:08,557
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

79
00:15:08,582 --> 00:15:14,999
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

80
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:19,209
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

81
00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:24,084
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

82
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:30,030
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

83
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:34,077
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

84
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:38,103
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

85
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:42,581
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

86
00:15:43,247 --> 00:15:50,594
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

87
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:55,871
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

88
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:59,975
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

89
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,929
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

90
00:16:06,954 --> 00:16:13,608
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

91
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:21,321
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

92
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,711
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

93
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:27,192
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

94
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:31,493
But when your ego is working or...

95
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:36,057
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

96
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:41,346
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

97
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,590
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

98
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:58,368
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

99
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,143
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

100
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:05,856
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

101
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:11,698
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

102
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:16,199
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

103
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:20,499
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

104
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:26,368
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

105
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:32,262
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

106
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,385
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

107
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,957
So, Mother has to tell you.

108
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:54,066
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

109
00:17:54,091 --> 00:18:00,454
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

110
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,274
She puts you into delusion,

111
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:09,016
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

112
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:15,397
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

113
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:21,025
She allows, allows you to go wrong

114
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,746
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

115
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,007
Very important it is that She plays,

116
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:32,759
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

117
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:36,950
And this is discussed
in every religion

118
00:18:36,975 --> 00:18:41,819
that we get lost with this delusion.

119
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:46,423
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

120
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:50,353
We have the delusions
of ego.

121
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:55,631
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

122
00:18:55,656 --> 00:19:02,206
 that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

123
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:06,621
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

124
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:11,487
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

125
00:19:11,512 --> 00:19:20,005
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

126
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,152
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

127
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:30,238
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

128
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:35,502
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

129
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:39,894
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

130
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:46,969
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

131
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:50,057
then only you can return back.

132
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:54,391
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

133
00:19:54,416 --> 00:20:05,675
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

134
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,440
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

135
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:17,026
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

136
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:23,061
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

137
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:26,384
It is beyond the mind.

138
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:33,417
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

139
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:41,069
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

140
00:20:41,094 --> 00:20:48,023
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

141
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:52,496
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

142
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:56,554
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

143
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,023
and this connection should not
be broken,

144
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:05,136
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

145
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:08,812
All this is within us,

146
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:15,158
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

147
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:22,044
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

148
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:27,137
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

149
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:34,870
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

150
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:40,790
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

151
00:21:40,815 --> 00:21:47,478
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:51,940
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

153
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:59,698
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

154
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:05,223
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

155
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:07,357
For example, it is also said that,

156
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:14,294
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

157
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:20,730
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

158
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:29,806
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

159
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,770
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

160
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:42,373
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

161
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:47,565
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

162
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:51,782
Lajja rupena samsthita:

163
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:57,974
means you have to have shame
of your body.

164
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:02,641
That’s specially for women.

165
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:11,297
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

166
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:14,378
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

167
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:17,341
That shyness gradually disappears,

168
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:20,841
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

169
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:25,301
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

170
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:30,452
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

171
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:34,431
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

172
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:39,670
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

173
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:44,551
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

174
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:49,647
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

175
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:54,681
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

176
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:59,587
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

177
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:03,687
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

178
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:07,021
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

179
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:10,705
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

180
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:17,590
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

181
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:24,767
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

182
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:33,497
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

183
00:24:33,522 --> 00:24:40,917
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

184
00:24:40,942 --> 00:24:45,734
There is no space for any artist

185
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:55,386
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

186
00:24:55,411 --> 00:25:02,451
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

187
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:06,660
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

188
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:14,328
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

189
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:19,976
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

190
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:23,627
then it is His art,

191
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:31,317
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

192
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:36,294
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

193
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,553
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

194
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:44,162
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

195
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,856
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

196
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:54,107
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

197
00:25:54,623 --> 00:26:00,405
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

198
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:04,503
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

199
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:09,720
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

200
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:13,412
and we start behaving in their
manner,

201
00:26:13,437 --> 00:26:16,463
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

202
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:21,846
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

203
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:26,441
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

204
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:30,593
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

205
00:26:30,618 --> 00:26:33,382
they would never have accepted
them.

206
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:36,464
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

207
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:39,834
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

208
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:45,427
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

209
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:52,238
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

210
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:57,129
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

211
00:26:57,154 --> 00:27:01,577
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

212
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:08,149
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

213
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:11,803
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

214
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:16,945
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

215
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,197
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

216
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:26,111
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

217
00:27:26,136 --> 00:27:30,196
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

218
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:33,672
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

219
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:41,738
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

220
00:27:41,763 --> 00:27:45,650
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

221
00:27:45,675 --> 00:27:49,748
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

222
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:56,303
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

223
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:01,732
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

224
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:09,452
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

225
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:12,655
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

226
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,259
or to worship the idols or anything,

227
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:24,714
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

228
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:30,424
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

229
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:37,660
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

230
00:28:37,685 --> 00:28:41,827
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

231
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:44,862
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

232
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:51,648
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

233
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:57,641
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

234
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:02,042
and this and that, and give
justification.

235
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:06,625
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

236
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,850
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

237
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,303
and who are misbehaving.

238
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:19,137
You must do what a saint should do.

239
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,788
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

240
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:28,674
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

241
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:35,105
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

242
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,222
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

243
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:42,865
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

244
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:48,185
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

245
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:52,646
You can change the things
that you are eating,

246
00:29:52,671 --> 00:29:58,271
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

247
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:05,881
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

248
00:30:06,276 --> 00:30:11,002
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

249
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:15,895
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

250
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,260
But all the time worried about
their body.

251
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:26,936
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

252
00:30:26,961 --> 00:30:35,366
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

253
00:30:36,228 --> 00:30:40,303
Fashion is madness.

254
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:47,845
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

255
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,573
But in India also fashion started.

256
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:55,041
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

257
00:30:55,067 --> 00:31:01,672
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

258
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:05,950
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

259
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:08,180
You have a particular design,

260
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:12,187
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

261
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:15,884
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

262
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:20,853
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

263
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:27,202
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

264
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:34,174
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

265
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:39,199
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

266
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:43,713
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

267
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:48,805
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

268
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,956
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

269
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:59,250
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

270
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:05,899
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

271
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,571
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

272
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,429
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

273
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:18,260
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

274
00:32:18,876 --> 00:32:24,890
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

275
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:28,271
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

276
00:32:28,296 --> 00:32:33,889
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

277
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:37,770
- you have to exercise and meditate.

278
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:42,343
If you meditate you become peaceful.

279
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:47,847
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

280
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,255
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

281
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,668
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

282
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:04,277
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

283
00:33:04,302 --> 00:33:10,130
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

284
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:17,160
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

285
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:22,462
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

286
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:30,099
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

287
00:33:30,124 --> 00:33:34,853
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

288
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:39,639
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

289
00:33:39,664 --> 00:33:43,207
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

290
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:45,959
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

291
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:50,386
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

292
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:54,282
The joy of that artist is finished.

293
00:33:54,307 --> 00:34:00,303
You cannot get that joy,

294
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:09,386
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

295
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:14,622
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

296
00:34:14,647 --> 00:34:20,500
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

297
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:23,772
and it makes the life so miserable.

298
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:28,495
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

299
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,308
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

300
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:39,556
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

301
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:43,432
problems of sometimes snowing.

302
00:34:43,464 --> 00:34:46,708
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

303
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:50,134
and it’s very well done, we got it.

304
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,074
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

305
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:02,735
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

306
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,018
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

307
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:12,604
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

308
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:18,878
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

309
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:22,579
of these Italians, so-called.

310
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:27,050
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

311
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:31,689
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

312
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:36,482
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

313
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:40,994
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

314
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:48,086
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

315
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:51,902
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

316
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:57,312
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

317
00:35:57,337 --> 00:36:00,944
With a simple thing like that.

318
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:07,903
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

319
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:11,114
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

320
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:14,020
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

321
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:17,345
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

322
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:22,421
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

323
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:27,322
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

324
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:31,860
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

325
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:37,172
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

326
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:43,023
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

327
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:50,744
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

328
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:58,657
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

329
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:04,011
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

330
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:10,320
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

331
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:17,192
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

332
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:33,428
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

333
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:41,158
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

334
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:45,123
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

335
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:48,727
What is the need to think?”.

336
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:56,085
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

337
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:00,333
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

338
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:04,282
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

339
00:38:04,307 --> 00:38:09,641
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

340
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:15,681
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

341
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:25,160
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

342
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:28,013
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

343
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:34,660
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

344
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:38,345
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

345
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,851
What is the need to go to Mars?

346
00:38:42,876 --> 00:38:47,318
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

347
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:50,037
First they came to India, then went
to China,

348
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:56,282
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

349
00:38:56,307 --> 00:39:00,429
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

350
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:05,013
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

351
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:10,061
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

352
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:13,928
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

353
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:17,337
then they’ll jump in.

354
00:39:17,362 --> 00:39:22,598
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

355
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:26,667
Because monkeys won’t do that.

356
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:33,682
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

357
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:38,898
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

358
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:44,178
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

359
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:49,160
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

360
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,464
They have no time!

361
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:55,729
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

362
00:39:55,754 --> 00:40:00,904
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

363
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:05,063
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

364
00:40:05,088 --> 00:40:08,554
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

365
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,001
For meditation they have no time.

366
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:19,984
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

367
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:27,515
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

368
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:34,724
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

369
00:40:35,735 --> 00:40:41,540
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

370
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:48,696
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

371
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:53,800
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

372
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:58,239
 But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

373
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:02,533
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

374
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:04,802
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

375
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:10,785
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

376
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,953
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

377
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:18,102
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

378
00:41:18,127 --> 00:41:21,116
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

379
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:25,106
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

380
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:33,162
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

381
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:39,178
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

382
00:41:39,203 --> 00:41:43,793
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

383
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:49,739
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

384
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:55,453
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

385
00:41:55,478 --> 00:42:03,270
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

386
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:12,613
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

387
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:20,295
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

388
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,804
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

389
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:29,623
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

390
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,739
So they also wanted to see.

391
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:42,348
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

392
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:50,275
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

393
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,896
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

394
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:59,605
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

395
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,128
Did you follow this point?

396
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:10,008
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

397
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:15,448
where you are yourself that.

398
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:20,444
So, how can you see yourself?

399
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:24,698
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

400
00:43:24,723 --> 00:43:28,623
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

401
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:34,835
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

402
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:40,051
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

403
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:44,245
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

404
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:52,280
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

405
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,916
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

406
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:04,999
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

407
00:44:05,365 --> 00:44:11,795
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

408
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:19,991
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

409
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:29,149
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

410
00:44:29,174 --> 00:44:36,478
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

411
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:42,333
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

412
00:44:42,358 --> 00:44:49,388
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

413
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:55,768
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

414
00:44:55,793 --> 00:45:00,591
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

415
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:06,653
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

416
00:45:06,678 --> 00:45:10,768
Whatever I may try on My own

417
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:15,407
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

418
00:45:15,432 --> 00:45:22,933
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

419
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:35,338
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

420
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:39,436
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

421
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:44,350
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

422
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:50,808
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

423
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:58,874
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

424
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:03,189
You use them.

425
00:46:04,604 --> 00:46:07,192
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

426
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:13,243
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

427
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:20,181
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

428
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:24,366
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

429
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:33,885
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

430
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:40,755
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

431
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:45,457
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

432
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:52,842
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

433
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:58,808
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

434
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:06,311
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

435
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:12,277
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

436
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:21,150
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

437
00:47:21,399 --> 00:47:29,455
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

438
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,122
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

439
00:47:32,147 --> 00:47:35,728
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

440
00:47:35,753 --> 00:47:41,097
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

441
00:47:41,122 --> 00:47:46,842
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

442
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:52,116
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

443
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:54,871
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

444
00:47:54,896 --> 00:47:59,260
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

445
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:03,852
He started looking at me
like this.’”

446
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,645
So, with the Kundalini awakening

447
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:12,359
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

448
00:48:12,384 --> 00:48:17,851
And then your generosity,

449
00:48:19,498 --> 00:48:26,020
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

450
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:32,894
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

451
00:48:34,377 --> 00:48:42,661
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

452
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:47,793
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

453
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:50,240
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

454
00:48:50,265 --> 00:48:57,984
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

455
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:02,588
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

456
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:12,424
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

457
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,665
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

458
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:26,587
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

459
00:49:26,612 --> 00:49:32,833
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

460
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:38,544
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

461
00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:43,417
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

462
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:49,384
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

463
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:55,965
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

464
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:58,532
They are just within you,

465
00:49:58,557 --> 00:50:05,102
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

466
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:10,217
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

467
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:17,381
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

468
00:50:17,406 --> 00:50:21,992
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

469
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:25,859
May God bless you all.
