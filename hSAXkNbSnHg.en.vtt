00:08.240 --> 00:22.529
[Music]

00:20.270 --> 00:28.110
as you know the Mahalakshmi principle

00:22.529 --> 00:33.920
lies within all of you in the set and

00:28.110 --> 00:41.809
once you are fed up with the falsehood

00:33.920 --> 00:46.609
and also with the hypocrisy of people

00:41.809 --> 00:49.559
you start seeking the truth within

00:46.609 --> 00:51.329
that's how a new category of people are

00:49.559 --> 00:55.409
born who are called

00:51.329 --> 01:01.039
a seeker sadhakas they are very

00:55.409 --> 01:13.940
different from others they don't care

01:01.039 --> 01:20.880
for any but usual being or any power

01:13.940 --> 01:24.990
position they want to seek the truth and

01:20.880 --> 01:28.670
this category is the one you are and

01:24.990 --> 01:28.670
that's why you have come to sahaja yoga

01:29.119 --> 01:36.770
this comes from your past lives also for

01:34.619 --> 01:40.640
many people I think is their past life

01:36.770 --> 01:44.670
which has brought the seeking in them

01:40.640 --> 01:47.789
also the fuels to which you have worn

01:44.670 --> 01:54.539
you got fed up with it and you are

01:47.789 --> 01:56.789
seeking the truth so now first of all to

01:54.539 --> 01:59.219
understand Mahalakshmi principle we must

01:56.789 --> 02:02.310
know that we have two other channels

01:59.219 --> 02:05.609
into which we can jump one is the left

02:02.310 --> 02:08.250
another is the right and it depends on

02:05.609 --> 02:11.190
what sort of a background you had in

02:08.250 --> 02:12.630
this life because of your background in

02:11.190 --> 02:17.810
last life you have come to the right

02:12.630 --> 02:22.020
path but last life is been covered by

02:17.810 --> 02:25.170
this life the surroundings the country

02:22.020 --> 02:28.470
in which you are born your friends

02:25.170 --> 02:35.280
a society in which he lived has

02:28.470 --> 02:37.800
dominated you in so many ways that the

02:35.280 --> 02:44.240
Mahalakshmi principle doesn't express

02:37.800 --> 02:48.209
itself in that full power

02:44.240 --> 02:52.680
we should really suck in everything else

02:48.209 --> 02:58.110
and put you on to the truth of a

02:52.680 --> 03:01.410
situation now for a sahaja yogi to keep

02:58.110 --> 03:05.010
his Mahalakshmi principle all right has

03:01.410 --> 03:09.350
to always introspect not to look at

03:05.010 --> 03:15.000
others but to introspect what am i doing

03:09.350 --> 03:24.360
am i in the left side or on the right

03:15.000 --> 03:30.650
side we said and what side I forward am

03:24.360 --> 03:36.090
I in the center now how will you judge

03:30.650 --> 03:40.049
the best is to feel your vibrations feel

03:36.090 --> 03:43.310
your vibrations but sometimes you could

03:40.049 --> 03:46.500
go so far to the left or to the right

03:43.310 --> 03:50.450
that you just do not feel vibrations

03:46.500 --> 03:55.070
your mileage may principle is not much

03:50.450 --> 03:57.690
then you go on it's like a complete

03:55.070 --> 04:00.000
derailment I should say a kind of a

03:57.690 --> 04:05.100
slope on which you just go on falling

04:00.000 --> 04:08.280
onto that so all these conditionings we

04:05.100 --> 04:11.489
should watch out in ourselves and in

04:08.280 --> 04:14.579
others how we have got these problems

04:11.489 --> 04:18.329
that we slip out from the central path

04:14.579 --> 04:21.060
imagine a train is going on a proper

04:18.329 --> 04:24.060
railway track and suddenly it starts

04:21.060 --> 04:24.630
moving this way or that way so when will

04:24.060 --> 04:29.060
it end

04:24.630 --> 04:33.390
into destruction but you have a way of

04:29.060 --> 04:36.920
arranging that this derailment can be

04:33.390 --> 04:40.250
brought back to the middle part

04:36.920 --> 04:43.880
so in a very detached way if you look at

04:40.250 --> 04:46.100
yourself like a witness and see for sure

04:43.880 --> 04:47.630
not about others even when I give

04:46.100 --> 04:49.160
lectures people start to how mother is

04:47.630 --> 04:53.510
saying about somebody else no I'm saying

04:49.160 --> 04:56.330
about you yourself so you watch out that

04:53.510 --> 05:01.880
are you in the center or are you going

04:56.330 --> 05:04.820
to the left or to the right first of all

05:01.880 --> 05:08.030
those who are in the center should not

05:04.820 --> 05:13.220
have any physical problems should be

05:08.030 --> 05:14.960
able to completely cure themselves if

05:13.220 --> 05:21.650
not others they should be able to cure

05:14.960 --> 05:26.290
themselves secondly the person who is in

05:21.650 --> 05:29.570
the center is a very peaceful person

05:26.290 --> 05:32.750
he's never angry he might put up a show

05:29.570 --> 05:35.630
that you are writing but he doesn't get

05:32.750 --> 05:39.170
involved in to anger or any emotions

05:35.630 --> 05:45.860
whatsoever he just watches and he can

05:39.170 --> 05:51.440
act he can act to me in that feeding of

05:45.860 --> 05:54.830
temper all so lust greed anything but

05:51.440 --> 05:58.670
just to act because sometimes this

05:54.830 --> 06:00.950
acting is needed so he can use it but

05:58.670 --> 06:03.650
you should be sure first of all that you

06:00.950 --> 06:06.740
are completely detached so first of all

06:03.650 --> 06:09.380
before acting you must become a master

06:06.740 --> 06:14.110
of acting and for that you have to

06:09.380 --> 06:19.340
become yourself if you become yourself

06:14.110 --> 06:24.380
then you are a master and you can see

06:19.340 --> 06:29.990
where are you waiting now the difference

06:24.380 --> 06:34.640
between a sahaja yogi and in sahaja yogi

06:29.990 --> 06:36.710
who is like this as you say is this that

06:34.640 --> 06:40.510
he is capable of going to the left or to

06:36.710 --> 06:42.830
the right there are solid researchers

06:40.510 --> 06:45.830
and they go on like this and there's no

06:42.830 --> 06:47.840
progress imagine any aeroplane which is

06:45.830 --> 06:49.380
wobbling like that will be on the ground

06:47.840 --> 06:56.610
only nobody will be

06:49.380 --> 06:59.910
to put it down in the air because god

06:56.610 --> 07:02.670
knows what when will it fall down so for

06:59.910 --> 07:04.800
any machinery we have to fix it up

07:02.670 --> 07:11.400
properly first before we start working

07:04.800 --> 07:14.490
it out to fix up our Mahalakshmi

07:11.400 --> 07:17.220
principle you have to see that your

07:14.490 --> 07:21.180
physical being is alright is normal no

07:17.220 --> 07:23.640
problem I am NOT mean meaning the modern

07:21.180 --> 07:26.580
ways of looking at health but that you

07:23.640 --> 07:29.430
should feel healthy and happy you should

07:26.580 --> 07:31.470
feel that there's no problem with your

07:29.430 --> 07:33.930
physical being but if you were

07:31.470 --> 07:35.850
complaining that I am here painting and

07:33.930 --> 07:43.620
painting there then there's something

07:35.850 --> 07:49.520
wrong this is the first criteria that

07:43.620 --> 07:53.660
you are in the center then your

07:49.520 --> 07:57.390
attention should be more towards nature

07:53.660 --> 08:00.570
how the nature is how it is blossoming

07:57.390 --> 08:04.140
how it is working out it should be

08:00.570 --> 08:06.180
towards the sky stars and things just to

08:04.140 --> 08:08.000
enjoy all the creation that is around

08:06.180 --> 08:13.590
just to enjoy it

08:08.000 --> 08:16.820
that's an enjoyment which is really so

08:13.590 --> 08:20.340
surprisingly deep when you see something

08:16.820 --> 08:23.280
beautiful scene or something you go to a

08:20.340 --> 08:25.980
very beautiful place then a kind of a

08:23.280 --> 08:29.390
joint that pours in you from your

08:25.980 --> 08:31.770
sahasrara that also you must experience

08:29.390 --> 08:34.410
also you must experience your

08:31.770 --> 08:36.360
thoughtless awareness that is when you

08:34.410 --> 08:39.560
look at something beautifully if you've

08:36.360 --> 08:42.900
suddenly become thoughtless just start

08:39.560 --> 08:46.290
seeing it the whole joy you start

08:42.900 --> 08:49.430
pouring for you all of you can know

08:46.290 --> 08:53.300
yourself very well because now you are

08:49.430 --> 08:55.740
quite sensitive and you have your own

08:53.300 --> 08:59.820
centers enlightened by my Lakshmi

08:55.740 --> 09:02.850
principle the Kundalini has definitely

08:59.820 --> 09:05.910
enlightened your Mahalakshmi principle

09:02.850 --> 09:07.950
so you can always make up where are what

09:05.910 --> 09:10.230
my chakras are how are they catching

09:07.950 --> 09:14.130
where are they catching instead of

09:10.230 --> 09:17.600
avoiding that you just work it out

09:14.130 --> 09:21.090
what's the problem where is the problem

09:17.600 --> 09:26.180
once you work it out then you'll be

09:21.090 --> 09:30.390
surprised that as soon as your desire

09:26.180 --> 09:33.090
goes inward the Kundalini itself will

09:30.390 --> 09:36.570
rush through and she will cleanse your

09:33.090 --> 09:39.720
chakras as I was telling you we do not

09:36.570 --> 09:42.990
know our powers only one thing you have

09:39.720 --> 09:47.190
to do is to desire you have to desire

09:42.990 --> 09:49.890
that let my my vibrations be alright let

09:47.190 --> 09:53.280
my chakras be cleared out let me be in

09:49.890 --> 09:55.200
the center in the balance just you have

09:53.280 --> 09:59.510
to desire but it's such a simple thing

09:55.200 --> 10:02.820
to desire but that also we cannot do our

09:59.510 --> 10:06.120
desires are something else not what we

10:02.820 --> 10:11.310
have to be just you have to desire that

10:06.120 --> 10:14.400
let me be a clean sahaja yogi let me be

10:11.310 --> 10:16.950
a solid sahaja yoga there are media cars

10:14.400 --> 10:22.380
who can never be I'm not talking about

10:16.950 --> 10:26.220
them but so many can be very high up can

10:22.380 --> 10:29.300
be very high up in sahaja yoga but their

10:26.220 --> 10:35.190
desires are not yet being fully

10:29.300 --> 10:36.890
manifested that is damping effect of so

10:35.190 --> 10:39.630
many things I have told you about

10:36.890 --> 10:42.210
so if supposing you have to pass the

10:39.630 --> 10:45.720
plate then you don't get down on the way

10:42.210 --> 10:48.750
somewhere and stay out in the same way

10:45.720 --> 10:51.360
when your Kundalini has to rise you can

10:48.750 --> 10:53.250
see everything that's happening but keep

10:51.360 --> 10:55.650
yourself aloof because you have to reach

10:53.250 --> 10:58.410
your point and that is through this

10:55.650 --> 11:00.600
Mahalakshmi principle it nourishes our

10:58.410 --> 11:03.600
brain our intellect everything

11:00.600 --> 11:07.170
iterations this small actually principle

11:03.600 --> 11:11.870
above all it is the balancing it

11:07.170 --> 11:15.490
balances if you are over doing something

11:11.870 --> 11:18.640
then it gives you a kind

11:15.490 --> 11:22.000
of a bush if you are not doing anything

11:18.640 --> 11:27.430
again it works in such a manner that it

11:22.000 --> 11:30.070
balances so this is the guiding factor

11:27.430 --> 11:36.120
for you this Mahalakshmi principle which

11:30.070 --> 11:40.180
works out everything you can say that is

11:36.120 --> 11:43.860
balancing the equilibrium and the wisdom

11:40.180 --> 11:49.480
as the light of Mahalakshmi principle

11:43.860 --> 11:52.080
starts the wisdom dawns upon the

11:49.480 --> 11:57.160
greatest of all is the noun

11:52.080 --> 12:01.649
love for God now for truth and you

11:57.160 --> 12:04.690
thrive on that love just you are there

12:01.649 --> 12:07.630
so this Mahalakshmi principle is to be

12:04.690 --> 12:11.709
preserved and has to be always watched

12:07.630 --> 12:14.920
and looked into and the blessings of

12:11.709 --> 12:17.350
Mahalakshmi are so many that I tell you

12:14.920 --> 12:18.790
I cannot even tell them in one lecture

12:17.350 --> 12:21.490
I'll have to give at least ten lectures

12:18.790 --> 12:24.339
but you yourself know what are the

12:21.490 --> 12:27.550
blessings of Mahalakshmi principle is

12:24.339 --> 12:32.250
the greatest is the complete self

12:27.550 --> 12:36.820
contentedness absolutely self content

12:32.250 --> 12:40.060
you don't want to grab something you

12:36.820 --> 12:43.360
want to run after something it's

12:40.060 --> 12:46.329
yourself content you don't want any

12:43.360 --> 12:50.079
publicity you don't want any comfort

12:46.329 --> 12:54.310
nothing you are comfortable in your

12:50.079 --> 12:59.940
spirit this is the greatest blessing of

12:54.310 --> 13:02.589
this Mahalakshmi music and if that is so

12:59.940 --> 13:05.140
then why not we look after our

13:02.589 --> 13:07.170
Mahalakshmi principle and forget about

13:05.140 --> 13:11.050
the rest

13:07.170 --> 13:15.670
last of all when it enters into your

13:11.050 --> 13:21.270
brain then the Virata is manifesting and

13:15.670 --> 13:21.270
you become collective absolutely perfect

13:21.889 --> 13:26.660
such a beautiful thing is to be

13:23.839 --> 13:30.110
collective there was a girl who went to

13:26.660 --> 13:32.420
Sicily and she was in a restaurant in

13:30.110 --> 13:35.449
something alone and then she looked at

13:32.420 --> 13:38.540
somebody else and that girl also looked

13:35.449 --> 13:41.629
at her and this one got up and came to

13:38.540 --> 13:44.959
her and she said they were not bearing

13:41.629 --> 13:49.670
matches they said have you been to Shri

13:44.959 --> 13:51.949
Mataji yes have you been yes we are

13:49.670 --> 13:55.699
sahaja Yogi's yes and then they just

13:51.949 --> 13:59.119
embraced each other such joy in far fush

13:55.699 --> 14:01.779
place somewhere in Sicily in a some

13:59.119 --> 14:04.850
breast drawing magic they just got lost

14:01.779 --> 14:07.670
but the feeling of oneness the

14:04.850 --> 14:09.559
Brotherhood the friendship is so great

14:07.670 --> 14:11.480
and so joyous

14:09.559 --> 14:13.519
you don't think considered from what

14:11.480 --> 14:16.730
country you are for where do you come

14:13.519 --> 14:18.980
what is the color of your skin or what

14:16.730 --> 14:21.999
is the religion you had followed what

14:18.980 --> 14:26.720
your parents are just you just enjoy

14:21.999 --> 14:31.670
meeting people this friendship

14:26.720 --> 14:34.610
this joy comes from the same Mahalakshmi

14:31.670 --> 14:38.329
principle she when she enlightens your

14:34.610 --> 14:42.199
sahasrara in the sahasrara you get this

14:38.329 --> 14:44.799
feeling of the whole and the feeling of

14:42.199 --> 14:47.059
the whole is something so great

14:44.799 --> 14:49.309
individualism people talk but it is

14:47.059 --> 14:51.589
against the principle of whole who do

14:49.309 --> 14:54.949
not know the whole you see talk of

14:51.589 --> 14:58.369
individualism this individualism which

14:54.949 --> 15:02.119
has worked all kinds of dangers for us

14:58.369 --> 15:06.139
now we have to know that we are one with

15:02.119 --> 15:08.449
the home of course we are individuals in

15:06.139 --> 15:11.480
the sense that we we have different

15:08.449 --> 15:14.720
different faces different roles

15:11.480 --> 15:19.449
different living different relationships

15:14.720 --> 15:19.449
but we belong to the whole

15:19.740 --> 15:25.860
and this without us feeling that we are

15:23.670 --> 15:29.490
part and parcel of the whole gives you

15:25.860 --> 15:32.040
complete peace and complete protection

15:29.490 --> 15:37.950
you never feel that something can happen

15:32.040 --> 15:39.900
to know some accident will take place

15:37.950 --> 15:44.130
all right will take place but nothing

15:39.900 --> 15:47.640
will happen to me a massage so many

15:44.130 --> 15:51.390
people have gained like this by allowing

15:47.640 --> 15:54.720
themselves to make completely looked

15:51.390 --> 15:56.330
after by this mahalakshmi's just

15:54.720 --> 16:00.180
surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle

15:56.330 --> 16:03.240
means that you give up your ego and you

16:00.180 --> 16:05.790
give up your conditionings we were both

16:03.240 --> 16:08.220
just surrendering you have Mahalakshmi

16:05.790 --> 16:11.000
principle that's why Mahalakshmi is so

16:08.220 --> 16:14.690
important

16:11.000 --> 16:14.690
may God bless you
