00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:22.529
[Music]

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:28.110
as you know the Mahalakshmi principle

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:33.920
lies within all of you in the set and

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:41.809
once you are fed up with the falsehood

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:46.609
and also with the hypocrisy of people

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.559
you start seeking the truth within

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.329
that's how a new category of people are

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.409
born who are called

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.039
a seeker sadhakas they are very

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:13.940
different from others they don't care

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:20.880
for any but usual being or any power

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:24.990
position they want to seek the truth and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.670
this category is the one you are and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.670
that's why you have come to sahaja yoga

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:36.770
this comes from your past lives also for

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.640
many people I think is their past life

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.670
which has brought the seeking in them

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.789
also the fuels to which you have worn

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:54.539
you got fed up with it and you are

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:56.789
seeking the truth so now first of all to

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.219
understand Mahalakshmi principle we must

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.310
know that we have two other channels

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.609
into which we can jump one is the left

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.250
another is the right and it depends on

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:11.190
what sort of a background you had in

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.630
this life because of your background in

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.810
last life you have come to the right

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:22.020
path but last life is been covered by

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.170
this life the surroundings the country

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.470
in which you are born your friends

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:35.280
a society in which he lived has

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:37.800
dominated you in so many ways that the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:44.240
Mahalakshmi principle doesn't express

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:48.209
itself in that full power

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:52.680
we should really suck in everything else

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:58.110
and put you on to the truth of a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.410
situation now for a sahaja yogi to keep

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.010
his Mahalakshmi principle all right has

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.350
to always introspect not to look at

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:15.000
others but to introspect what am i doing

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:24.360
am i in the left side or on the right

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:30.650
side we said and what side I forward am

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:36.090
I in the center now how will you judge

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:40.049
the best is to feel your vibrations feel

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.310
your vibrations but sometimes you could

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.500
go so far to the left or to the right

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.450
that you just do not feel vibrations

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.070
your mileage may principle is not much

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.690
then you go on it's like a complete

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.000
derailment I should say a kind of a

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.100
slope on which you just go on falling

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.280
onto that so all these conditionings we

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.489
should watch out in ourselves and in

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.579
others how we have got these problems

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.329
that we slip out from the central path

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:21.060
imagine a train is going on a proper

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.060
railway track and suddenly it starts

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.630
moving this way or that way so when will

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.060
it end

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:33.390
into destruction but you have a way of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.920
arranging that this derailment can be

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.250
brought back to the middle part

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.880
so in a very detached way if you look at

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.100
yourself like a witness and see for sure

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.630
not about others even when I give

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.160
lectures people start to how mother is

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.510
saying about somebody else no I'm saying

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.330
about you yourself so you watch out that

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:01.880
are you in the center or are you going

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:04.820
to the left or to the right first of all

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.030
those who are in the center should not

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:13.220
have any physical problems should be

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.960
able to completely cure themselves if

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:21.650
not others they should be able to cure

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:26.290
themselves secondly the person who is in

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:29.570
the center is a very peaceful person

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.750
he's never angry he might put up a show

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.630
that you are writing but he doesn't get

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.170
involved in to anger or any emotions

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:45.860
whatsoever he just watches and he can

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:51.440
act he can act to me in that feeding of

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:54.830
temper all so lust greed anything but

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.670
just to act because sometimes this

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.950
acting is needed so he can use it but

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.650
you should be sure first of all that you

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.740
are completely detached so first of all

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.380
before acting you must become a master

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.110
of acting and for that you have to

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:19.340
become yourself if you become yourself

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:24.380
then you are a master and you can see

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:29.990
where are you waiting now the difference

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:34.640
between a sahaja yogi and in sahaja yogi

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:36.710
who is like this as you say is this that

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.510
he is capable of going to the left or to

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.830
the right there are solid researchers

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.830
and they go on like this and there's no

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.840
progress imagine any aeroplane which is

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.380
wobbling like that will be on the ground

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.610
only nobody will be

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:59.910
to put it down in the air because god

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.670
knows what when will it fall down so for

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.800
any machinery we have to fix it up

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:11.400
properly first before we start working

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:14.490
it out to fix up our Mahalakshmi

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.220
principle you have to see that your

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:21.180
physical being is alright is normal no

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:23.640
problem I am NOT mean meaning the modern

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.580
ways of looking at health but that you

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.430
should feel healthy and happy you should

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.470
feel that there's no problem with your

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.930
physical being but if you were

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.850
complaining that I am here painting and

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:43.620
painting there then there's something

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:49.520
wrong this is the first criteria that

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:53.660
you are in the center then your

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:57.390
attention should be more towards nature

00:07:53.660 --> 00:08:00.570
how the nature is how it is blossoming

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:04.140
how it is working out it should be

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:06.180
towards the sky stars and things just to

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.000
enjoy all the creation that is around

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:13.590
just to enjoy it

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.820
that's an enjoyment which is really so

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:20.340
surprisingly deep when you see something

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:23.280
beautiful scene or something you go to a

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.980
very beautiful place then a kind of a

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.390
joint that pours in you from your

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:31.770
sahasrara that also you must experience

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:34.410
also you must experience your

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.360
thoughtless awareness that is when you

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.560
look at something beautifully if you've

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:42.900
suddenly become thoughtless just start

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.290
seeing it the whole joy you start

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:49.430
pouring for you all of you can know

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:53.300
yourself very well because now you are

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:55.740
quite sensitive and you have your own

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.820
centers enlightened by my Lakshmi

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:02.850
principle the Kundalini has definitely

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:05.910
enlightened your Mahalakshmi principle

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.950
so you can always make up where are what

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.230
my chakras are how are they catching

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:14.130
where are they catching instead of

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:17.600
avoiding that you just work it out

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:21.090
what's the problem where is the problem

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:26.180
once you work it out then you'll be

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:30.390
surprised that as soon as your desire

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:33.090
goes inward the Kundalini itself will

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:36.570
rush through and she will cleanse your

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:39.720
chakras as I was telling you we do not

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:42.990
know our powers only one thing you have

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:47.190
to do is to desire you have to desire

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:49.890
that let my my vibrations be alright let

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:53.280
my chakras be cleared out let me be in

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:55.200
the center in the balance just you have

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.510
to desire but it's such a simple thing

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.820
to desire but that also we cannot do our

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:06.120
desires are something else not what we

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:11.310
have to be just you have to desire that

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:14.400
let me be a clean sahaja yogi let me be

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.950
a solid sahaja yoga there are media cars

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:22.380
who can never be I'm not talking about

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:26.220
them but so many can be very high up can

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:29.300
be very high up in sahaja yoga but their

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:35.190
desires are not yet being fully

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:36.890
manifested that is damping effect of so

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.630
many things I have told you about

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:42.210
so if supposing you have to pass the

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:45.720
plate then you don't get down on the way

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:48.750
somewhere and stay out in the same way

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.360
when your Kundalini has to rise you can

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.250
see everything that's happening but keep

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.650
yourself aloof because you have to reach

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:58.410
your point and that is through this

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.600
Mahalakshmi principle it nourishes our

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.600
brain our intellect everything

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:07.170
iterations this small actually principle

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:11.870
above all it is the balancing it

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:15.490
balances if you are over doing something

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:18.640
then it gives you a kind

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:22.000
of a bush if you are not doing anything

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:27.430
again it works in such a manner that it

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.070
balances so this is the guiding factor

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:36.120
for you this Mahalakshmi principle which

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:40.180
works out everything you can say that is

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:43.860
balancing the equilibrium and the wisdom

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:49.480
as the light of Mahalakshmi principle

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:52.080
starts the wisdom dawns upon the

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:57.160
greatest of all is the noun

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:01.649
love for God now for truth and you

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:04.690
thrive on that love just you are there

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:07.630
so this Mahalakshmi principle is to be

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:11.709
preserved and has to be always watched

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:14.920
and looked into and the blessings of

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:17.350
Mahalakshmi are so many that I tell you

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.790
I cannot even tell them in one lecture

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.490
I'll have to give at least ten lectures

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:24.339
but you yourself know what are the

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:27.550
blessings of Mahalakshmi principle is

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:32.250
the greatest is the complete self

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:36.820
contentedness absolutely self content

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:40.060
you don't want to grab something you

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:43.360
want to run after something it's

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:46.329
yourself content you don't want any

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.079
publicity you don't want any comfort

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:54.310
nothing you are comfortable in your

00:12:50.079 --> 00:12:59.940
spirit this is the greatest blessing of

00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:02.589
this Mahalakshmi music and if that is so

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:05.140
then why not we look after our

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:07.170
Mahalakshmi principle and forget about

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:11.050
the rest

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:15.670
last of all when it enters into your

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:21.270
brain then the Virata is manifesting and

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:21.270
you become collective absolutely perfect

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:26.660
such a beautiful thing is to be

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:30.110
collective there was a girl who went to

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.420
Sicily and she was in a restaurant in

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.449
something alone and then she looked at

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:38.540
somebody else and that girl also looked

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:41.629
at her and this one got up and came to

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:44.959
her and she said they were not bearing

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:49.670
matches they said have you been to Shri

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:51.949
Mataji yes have you been yes we are

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:55.699
sahaja Yogi's yes and then they just

00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:59.119
embraced each other such joy in far fush

00:13:55.699 --> 00:14:01.779
place somewhere in Sicily in a some

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:04.850
breast drawing magic they just got lost

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:07.670
but the feeling of oneness the

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:09.559
Brotherhood the friendship is so great

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.480
and so joyous

00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:13.519
you don't think considered from what

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.730
country you are for where do you come

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:18.980
what is the color of your skin or what

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.999
is the religion you had followed what

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:26.720
your parents are just you just enjoy

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:31.670
meeting people this friendship

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:34.610
this joy comes from the same Mahalakshmi

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:38.329
principle she when she enlightens your

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:42.199
sahasrara in the sahasrara you get this

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:44.799
feeling of the whole and the feeling of

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:47.059
the whole is something so great

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:49.309
individualism people talk but it is

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:51.589
against the principle of whole who do

00:14:49.309 --> 00:14:54.949
not know the whole you see talk of

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:58.369
individualism this individualism which

00:14:54.949 --> 00:15:02.119
has worked all kinds of dangers for us

00:14:58.369 --> 00:15:06.139
now we have to know that we are one with

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:08.449
the home of course we are individuals in

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:11.480
the sense that we we have different

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:14.720
different faces different roles

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:19.449
different living different relationships

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.449
but we belong to the whole

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:25.860
and this without us feeling that we are

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:29.490
part and parcel of the whole gives you

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:32.040
complete peace and complete protection

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:37.950
you never feel that something can happen

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:39.900
to know some accident will take place

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:44.130
all right will take place but nothing

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:47.640
will happen to me a massage so many

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:51.390
people have gained like this by allowing

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:54.720
themselves to make completely looked

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:56.330
after by this mahalakshmi's just

00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.180
surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:03.240
means that you give up your ego and you

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.790
give up your conditionings we were both

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.220
just surrendering you have Mahalakshmi

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:11.000
principle that's why Mahalakshmi is so

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:14.690
important

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.690
may God bless you
