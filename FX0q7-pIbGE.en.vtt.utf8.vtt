WEBVTT

00:18.410 --> 00:23.040
they're just Alaskan questions running

00:20.670 --> 00:24.620
the best of them just practical

00:23.040 --> 00:28.820
practical so that's good

00:24.620 --> 00:28.820
ask practical questions

00:32.990 --> 00:36.149
[Applause]

00:43.690 --> 00:47.809
would you like to talk to them for a

00:45.890 --> 00:57.350
while and just ah I just talked to them

00:47.809 --> 01:00.080
they asked their questions in person I'm

00:57.350 --> 01:01.699
overjoyed to see you all here actually

01:00.080 --> 01:04.580
the whole night I was working on

01:01.699 --> 01:07.780
Melbourne seekers that they should come

01:04.580 --> 01:13.310
today and should establish their

01:07.780 --> 01:16.100
realisation very well now we have to

01:13.310 --> 01:19.100
understand few things about sahaja yoga

01:16.100 --> 01:21.860
very clearly and there is no compromise

01:19.100 --> 01:25.460
on these few things that we have to

01:21.860 --> 01:27.950
accept because as I told you truth

01:25.460 --> 01:30.920
cannot compromise for you you have to

01:27.950 --> 01:34.970
compromise for truth so the first is

01:30.920 --> 01:38.619
that sahaja Yoga is not just a precept

01:34.970 --> 01:42.830
it's not just a precept it is practice

01:38.619 --> 01:45.470
it is not just a mental idea now you've

01:42.830 --> 01:46.340
got realization all right but it's not

01:45.470 --> 01:47.810
sufficient

01:46.340 --> 01:50.990
even if think that you've got

01:47.810 --> 01:56.030
realization so now you are all right you

01:50.990 --> 01:58.160
become the spirit all right but still it

01:56.030 --> 02:03.560
is more a mental conception than the

01:58.160 --> 02:05.300
real identification so it is not that if

02:03.560 --> 02:07.640
you become your realization and if you

02:05.300 --> 02:09.410
get your realization and you starts the

02:07.640 --> 02:13.550
awakening what your Kundalini starts

02:09.410 --> 02:15.709
very well still it is to be understood

02:13.550 --> 02:17.959
that it is the practice of sahaja yoga

02:15.709 --> 02:22.010
which is much more important than the

02:17.959 --> 02:25.030
precepts of it there are many people in

02:22.010 --> 02:27.110
India who can't read or write

02:25.030 --> 02:29.959
who don't have all these mental

02:27.110 --> 02:32.750
activities as you have they are not so

02:29.959 --> 02:35.420
complicated as you are some of them are

02:32.750 --> 02:38.810
Aboriginal people just living in the

02:35.420 --> 02:42.770
village is very simple people they get

02:38.810 --> 02:45.290
realization they feel the joy much

02:42.770 --> 02:47.959
faster than the complicated ones be

02:45.290 --> 02:50.060
and they just start working on it you

02:47.959 --> 02:54.200
have to work it out this is not a

02:50.060 --> 02:58.280
compassion that speaks talks elaborates

02:54.200 --> 03:00.290
and advertises but it works sahaja Yoga

02:58.280 --> 03:03.409
is a thing that works the religion that

03:00.290 --> 03:05.390
works and this is what we must

03:03.409 --> 03:12.980
understand first of all that it is not

03:05.390 --> 03:17.560
that talking it is not the precept that

03:12.980 --> 03:20.480
you are a great soul you have to become

03:17.560 --> 03:22.940
not that you are not you are but you

03:20.480 --> 03:24.139
have to be aware of more light has to

03:22.940 --> 03:26.450
fall flow into you

03:24.139 --> 03:28.849
the definitely you must be something

03:26.450 --> 03:32.560
special to get it no doubt but you must

03:28.849 --> 03:35.870
allow your lamp to be cleared out

03:32.560 --> 03:39.049
cleansed so that more light is given and

03:35.870 --> 03:42.849
it works wonders for for people so

03:39.049 --> 03:45.889
honestly want to ascend in spirituality

03:42.849 --> 03:49.250
as I told you before also that it is a

03:45.889 --> 03:53.780
concept many people have that sahaja

03:49.250 --> 03:57.319
yoga your speed it's not true it just

03:53.780 --> 04:01.069
has a by-product it make urea just as a

03:57.319 --> 04:04.599
by-product so one has to understand the

04:01.069 --> 04:08.750
blessing has come to you only because

04:04.599 --> 04:10.459
you are a seeker you have done lots of

04:08.750 --> 04:13.489
good in your past lives and this life

04:10.459 --> 04:18.079
also and that God has chosen you to be

04:13.489 --> 04:21.349
in his kingdom but it cannot be

04:18.079 --> 04:23.810
demanding you cannot demand you can't

04:21.349 --> 04:25.400
demand anything from God he has to give

04:23.810 --> 04:28.159
you because he knows what you deserve

04:25.400 --> 04:29.180
and he gives you much much much more

04:28.159 --> 04:30.830
than what you deserve

04:29.180 --> 04:32.360
I mean I have seen people who have been

04:30.830 --> 04:34.699
in sahaja yoga that after one year they

04:32.360 --> 04:37.940
start asking but then what did we do to

04:34.699 --> 04:40.310
deserve all this they just can't believe

04:37.940 --> 04:42.830
it as it must be something you must know

04:40.310 --> 04:46.699
there was something but the blessings

04:42.830 --> 04:49.070
have come to you this is one thing one

04:46.699 --> 04:51.979
has to understand that you cannot make

04:49.070 --> 04:54.050
sahaja yoga compromise for you you have

04:51.979 --> 04:57.950
to understand all the techniques and

04:54.050 --> 04:59.750
things about sahaja yoga now the thing

04:57.950 --> 05:02.060
would be that you may start

04:59.750 --> 05:04.669
you see so that's what we have people

05:02.060 --> 05:06.470
who are doubting about it and doing all

05:04.669 --> 05:09.889
kinds of things in the beginning there

05:06.470 --> 05:11.300
are other slow movers so we have to sort

05:09.889 --> 05:14.210
them out to begin with because the

05:11.300 --> 05:17.840
second stage of awareness is doubtless

05:14.210 --> 05:18.620
awareness you are doubtless about

05:17.840 --> 05:21.110
yourself

05:18.620 --> 05:21.620
doubtless about the working of sahaja

05:21.110 --> 05:23.840
yoga

05:21.620 --> 05:26.300
doubtless about God's existence and

05:23.840 --> 05:28.250
outlets about his laws have become

05:26.300 --> 05:30.830
absolutely doubtless not mentally but

05:28.250 --> 05:36.139
it's a state it's a state of your being

05:30.830 --> 05:38.690
by which you achieve lots of results and

05:36.139 --> 05:40.940
you really become powerful then you can

05:38.690 --> 05:43.729
see your compassion so powerful so

05:40.940 --> 05:45.289
discreet so understanding so forbearing

05:43.729 --> 05:48.110
and you are amazed at yourself you

05:45.289 --> 05:50.560
really become a saint in the real sense

05:48.110 --> 05:54.110
of the word that you become humble

05:50.560 --> 05:57.139
flowering beautifully not taking

05:54.110 --> 05:59.960
anything aggressive on you upon yourself

05:57.139 --> 06:01.550
and you are really in the kingdom of God

05:59.960 --> 06:04.940
that you feel that you are looked after

06:01.550 --> 06:07.490
protected guided blessed every moment

06:04.940 --> 06:11.870
you walk along and that's the state

06:07.490 --> 06:13.940
everybody should aspire to reach is the

06:11.870 --> 06:16.639
doubtless awareness and unless until you

06:13.940 --> 06:18.860
reach that state we don't call you

06:16.639 --> 06:21.440
sahaja yogi you may start calling

06:18.860 --> 06:24.080
yourself but that's lift to yourself see

06:21.440 --> 06:27.020
there are no sort of we don't have any

06:24.080 --> 06:29.240
certification or things going on or we

06:27.020 --> 06:30.440
do not give any written certificates to

06:29.240 --> 06:34.449
people nothing of the kind

06:30.440 --> 06:37.849
it is you who has to certify yourself so

06:34.449 --> 06:41.930
gradually people grow up into beautiful

06:37.849 --> 06:44.120
beings they start having their self

06:41.930 --> 06:46.879
esteem fully established understanding

06:44.120 --> 06:49.039
themselves but practice of sahaja yoga

06:46.879 --> 06:52.009
must be done without thinking too much

06:49.039 --> 06:53.990
about it first you just try it but try

06:52.009 --> 06:57.110
because if you start doubting I tell you

06:53.990 --> 07:00.199
your progress will be much less so first

06:57.110 --> 07:01.909
just like a scientist to try to accept

07:00.199 --> 07:03.110
one by whether there's nothing has to be

07:01.909 --> 07:05.539
done I mean don't have to pay me

07:03.110 --> 07:07.639
anything of course that goes you don't

07:05.539 --> 07:09.919
have to do any acrobatics or anything

07:07.639 --> 07:11.419
but for example a small thing like my

07:09.919 --> 07:12.740
photograph you see many people say why

07:11.419 --> 07:14.960
your photograph so

07:12.740 --> 07:17.150
your photograph I say if that works out

07:14.960 --> 07:18.740
you say is something surprising that's

07:17.150 --> 07:20.360
how people will challenge me while your

07:18.740 --> 07:22.069
photograph is why not use yours I will

07:20.360 --> 07:23.419
be very happy use anybody's but doesn't

07:22.069 --> 07:25.370
work out what to do now

07:23.419 --> 07:27.199
it's mine photograph that works out but

07:25.370 --> 07:30.009
even if you don't like it you have to

07:27.199 --> 07:33.259
use it what can I do

07:30.009 --> 07:35.090
it's as simple that's bad you see but in

07:33.259 --> 07:36.710
that I don't gain anything from you I

07:35.090 --> 07:40.610
don't want anything from you nothing

07:36.710 --> 07:42.770
material that you can give me but you

07:40.610 --> 07:45.470
will enjoy you'll enjoy my laugh you'll

07:42.770 --> 07:48.409
enjoy it's all for your own enjoyment

07:45.470 --> 07:50.630
everything is done and this is a special

07:48.409 --> 07:53.810
time we are born in we have a special

07:50.630 --> 07:56.270
responsibility today we had a lady who

07:53.810 --> 08:00.740
came her husband came and they were

07:56.270 --> 08:03.110
saying that you had a son who was very

08:00.740 --> 08:05.030
well equipped and he went to one of the

08:03.110 --> 08:08.090
gurus and he got completely ruined

08:05.030 --> 08:10.310
and this particular guru we have to be

08:08.090 --> 08:13.130
rather careful about his disrelish fella

08:10.310 --> 08:14.810
his disciples are rather difficult they

08:13.130 --> 08:17.990
come to sahaja yoga right but they are

08:14.810 --> 08:19.430
very extreme type of people they come

08:17.990 --> 08:21.349
with a great force to sahaja yoga again

08:19.430 --> 08:23.030
go back so all those who have been to

08:21.349 --> 08:25.699
Rajneesh and have taken his initiation

08:23.030 --> 08:27.979
have to be extremely careful all of you

08:25.699 --> 08:30.590
who have been to gurus must know that

08:27.979 --> 08:33.020
they will be again and again attacked so

08:30.590 --> 08:35.270
you have to be rather patient with

08:33.020 --> 08:37.010
yourself as we are with you and must

08:35.270 --> 08:39.919
know that you must assert your willpower

08:37.010 --> 08:44.540
a little bit to come up and shade off

08:39.919 --> 08:46.730
all that was screwed into your head and

08:44.540 --> 08:48.950
you paid for it you see forget it

08:46.730 --> 08:51.649
sometimes people say that we have paid

08:48.950 --> 08:53.540
for it so better have it that's not the

08:51.649 --> 08:55.550
way you better throw it away it's

08:53.540 --> 08:58.370
horrible you have bought a snake on your

08:55.550 --> 09:00.800
head on your neck so just throw away all

08:58.370 --> 09:03.560
these things that they have put you

09:00.800 --> 09:06.079
aren't forget it and become yourself

09:03.560 --> 09:08.450
first of all become your own guru

09:06.079 --> 09:10.930
ask your vibrations develop your

09:08.450 --> 09:14.329
vibratory awareness and grow with it

09:10.930 --> 09:16.910
some people will find also that their

09:14.329 --> 09:18.680
vibrations are not showing very good

09:16.910 --> 09:23.240
results some of you will find that kind

09:18.680 --> 09:25.370
of thing and when you find that your

09:23.240 --> 09:27.650
vibrations are not

09:25.370 --> 09:29.120
working out in your hands and things you

09:27.650 --> 09:30.740
should not get worried about it maybe

09:29.120 --> 09:32.870
your visshuddhi chakra is not alright

09:30.740 --> 09:35.060
there are ways and methods of improving

09:32.870 --> 09:39.590
the shooty chakra by which you know the

09:35.060 --> 09:42.980
exact mantras to be said and how to

09:39.590 --> 09:45.290
improve it and we have also vibrated oil

09:42.980 --> 09:47.480
and all that you can apply here and also

09:45.290 --> 09:49.220
there are other methods by which you can

09:47.480 --> 09:50.810
improve your sinus and if you have any

09:49.220 --> 09:53.090
problem with the visually because of

09:50.810 --> 09:55.250
over smoking or anything there are so

09:53.090 --> 09:57.050
many ways which you can call the

09:55.250 --> 09:59.450
grandmother's medicine simple simple

09:57.050 --> 10:00.200
things which will work it out you try to

09:59.450 --> 10:02.780
clear out

10:00.200 --> 10:05.270
so whatever center is not working out

10:02.780 --> 10:06.920
you should get after that and don't

10:05.270 --> 10:08.480
worry about the centers that are good

10:06.920 --> 10:10.340
because those who are good are good so

10:08.480 --> 10:13.040
we have to look after the centers which

10:10.340 --> 10:18.170
are in trouble and try to improve our

10:13.040 --> 10:20.090
centers and the complete being is to be

10:18.170 --> 10:23.270
brought to the balance some people have

10:20.090 --> 10:24.920
some centers so badly off that despite

10:23.270 --> 10:27.590
the fact that all the centers all right

10:24.920 --> 10:30.080
because of one center you see there any

10:27.590 --> 10:33.680
imbalance so first thing in sahaja Yoga

10:30.080 --> 10:35.630
is to establish a balance now certain

10:33.680 --> 10:37.730
things about morality and all that I

10:35.630 --> 10:40.520
don't want to talk to you gradually

10:37.730 --> 10:43.190
yourself Radel realize what is good for

10:40.520 --> 10:44.780
you bad for you but in sahaja yoga you

10:43.190 --> 10:47.270
will be given a proper guidance as to

10:44.780 --> 10:51.200
what is to be done how to lead a life

10:47.270 --> 10:53.720
and how to have a normal good marriage

10:51.200 --> 10:56.060
life how to have children how to look

10:53.720 --> 10:58.940
after them how to get to your parents so

10:56.060 --> 11:01.790
the social side also you can learn very

10:58.940 --> 11:03.890
well by which you really feel happy but

11:01.790 --> 11:06.350
the main society that you have is of

11:03.890 --> 11:08.210
sahaja Yogi's of course you don't have

11:06.350 --> 11:11.380
to cut off from anyone you don't have to

11:08.210 --> 11:13.730
give up anyone but you grow among your

11:11.380 --> 11:17.180
sahaja Yogi's these are called as such

11:13.730 --> 11:20.450
an assessee sir Jana the people who are

11:17.180 --> 11:22.610
the followers of truth so once you come

11:20.450 --> 11:25.520
together it's a collective happening

11:22.610 --> 11:27.500
it works out more collectively and it

11:25.520 --> 11:29.240
helps you much more but if you say

11:27.500 --> 11:30.740
individually mother I can do it it

11:29.240 --> 11:32.030
doesn't work out in sahaja yoga I've

11:30.740 --> 11:34.520
seen you don't go too far

11:32.030 --> 11:36.650
you all have to work it together you

11:34.520 --> 11:39.139
have to meet luckily you have a very

11:36.650 --> 11:40.850
good ashram here you all can come and

11:39.139 --> 11:42.949
meditate and take a proper help from

11:40.850 --> 11:45.079
these people God has already blessed

11:42.949 --> 11:47.269
this place so much and when I came to

11:45.079 --> 11:49.220
Melbourne we I stayed in a very small

11:47.269 --> 11:50.839
little house with I think two bedrooms

11:49.220 --> 11:53.689
and some sort of a thing like that and

11:50.839 --> 11:55.879
this time I find a big huge thing being

11:53.689 --> 12:00.949
given to you and they may start it also

11:55.879 --> 12:02.660
ani school for small children here your

12:00.949 --> 12:04.879
small children can go to that school

12:02.660 --> 12:06.529
where they can be looked after well they

12:04.879 --> 12:10.759
won't have any complications and

12:06.529 --> 12:13.399
everything can be done at a much better

12:10.759 --> 12:16.999
level than what you find in the mundane

12:13.399 --> 12:19.100
life everything has a meaning spiritual

12:16.999 --> 12:21.589
meaning everything in life has a meaning

12:19.100 --> 12:24.709
so you should try to find out whatever

12:21.589 --> 12:28.389
is good for your ascent and for your

12:24.709 --> 12:32.449
nourishing of your spiritual being I

12:28.389 --> 12:35.959
hope next time when I come all of you

12:32.449 --> 12:38.720
will be great sahaja Yogi's and will be

12:35.959 --> 12:41.149
great people individually everyone will

12:38.720 --> 12:42.619
be working out on many people and we

12:41.149 --> 12:46.839
have to change the face of Melbourne

12:42.619 --> 12:46.839
completely may God bless you
