00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:10.666
It’s so nice to come back after such a long time.

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:17.401
And whenever I came, you always had gathered in a very big hall.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:22.906
We met, and that’s how the Sahaja Yoga started growing.

00:00:23.693 --> 00:00:34.670
It’s very important for you people from specially from Germany, Austria.

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:40.498
These are the people who were in the war.

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:44.306
And now you are in the war with Me.

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:48.798
We have to fight, fight the evil.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.280
You know how the world is.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:58.714
We have to fight them and we have to take them out of ignorance.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:10.426
You are such a support for this because we have to change human beings.

00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:16.107
They have to become good people very fast.

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:21.159
Once they get their Self-realization, the change will start.

00:01:21.668 --> 00:01:25.514
Now in England and also in Italy,

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.002
what they are doing is to give realization to people on the street.

00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:36.396
Giving on the street, thousands of people now have become realized souls.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.930
It’s a very big thing because once you get your realization,
you become the Spirit

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.533
and all the goodness should come to you.

00:01:46.668 --> 00:01:50.791
If there is anything evil, bad in you that will go away.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.330
It’s spreading so fast everywhere
and should also spread in those countries who are there.

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:04.093
There’s no need, no need for you to fight or quarrel

00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:07.854
because you have got the divine help.

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:15.002
You have got all the help all the time from the Divine,

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:18.959
and this is what is to be understood:

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:26.653
that we are helped by the Divine to transform
human beings into something greater.

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:30.860
That’s what we are and we are here

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:36.924
because I wanted to tell people that you must have a place, an ashram

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:43.953
for Sahaja Yoga, and I don’t want anybody else, but only sahaja yogis there

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:48.051
because you don’t know how dirty people are in this world.

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:54.232
What things they do, you can’t imagine to what limit they can go and

00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:57.648
can really try to harm you

00:02:57.892 --> 00:03:02.946
because they are not only negative, but they are sometimes satanic

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.705
and they’ll try to ruin your children,

00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:08.788
ruin your families, do all kinds of things.

00:03:08.962 --> 00:03:11.748
So you have nothing to do with them. Keep away.

00:03:12.073 --> 00:03:16.142
Keep aloof because now you all have been cleansed.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.968
Those who are cleansed people don’t mix up
with people who are muddy, do they?

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.109
And so must have this much of wisdom in your head to understand

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:32.187
that at any cost you will not mix up Sahaja Yoga with other things.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.934
It’s very important to know.

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:41.773
I have been trying to tell this since long that keep yourself aloof.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.413
But sometimes people don’t do it and then they suffer a lot.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.350
We have all kinds of devils around, all kinds of satanic forces acting as some sort of a

00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:57.919
cult, or I don’t know what they are doing,

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:01.355
but they’ve done no good to people, no good at all.

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:07.863
Just see what is going on in those days: is all kinds of fighting, quarrelling, killing.

00:04:08.155 --> 00:04:15.688
All this is going on, so you must know we are in the very, very bad type of Kali Yuga

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.883
and we have to fight it out by collectivity.

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.418
Look at the children, how collective they are.

00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:26.655
You all have to be collective and you must love

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.475
all the people, all the sahaja yogis who are around.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.679
Don’t try to find faults with them.

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:41.367
Don’t try to fight with them because it’s a very important work I am doing.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.389
What I’m trying to do is to transform people,

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:49.719
to make them good people, nice people.

00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:56.663
It’s not to get anything out of them, but to give them something

00:04:56.845 --> 00:05:00.160
that they should becomevery good people.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.315
We have to have extremely good and nice people,

00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:10.471
people who don’t hate, people who don’t have greed.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.863
Like madness, people have greed.

00:05:14.077 --> 00:05:19.133
In countries where they could make money, they have cheated everyone

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.521
and have made money,and that is how their children will suffer.

00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:26.124
They will suffer.

00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:30.633
So My attention is for all of you

00:05:30.832 --> 00:05:35.196
because you can help Me in this great war,

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.313
war with the evil.

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:43.754
These are evil people by temperament

00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:47.153
and they want to ruin it. You must understand this.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.794
Don’t play into their hands and you become solid
because you have not come on this Earth to collect

00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:56.942
things and all that, but you have come here

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.788
to become sahaja yogis of a very great order.

00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:09.605
Another thing is, if you don’t feel your joy within yourself,

00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:13.623
if there is no joy with you, you will trouble others.

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:16.816
So best thing is for you is to meditate,

00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:21.086
not to criticize, not to use your brain, but meditate.

00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:25.933
By meditation, you will know how to enjoy Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:32.203
how to enjoy everything.
This has to be there and this mental activity should go away.

00:06:32.578 --> 00:06:35.174
Don’t try to organize others.

00:06:35.347 --> 00:06:40.472
Don’t try to give lectures to others, but what you do

00:06:40.552 --> 00:06:44.551
is to yourself introspect. See for yourself

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:49.107
what’s wrong with you and what's wrong things you are doing.

00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:26.923
So not only being peaceful is everything, no.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.725
Not only being good is equal, all right, but

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:37.579
you have to make others, you have to make others good people.

00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.662
You have to make them beautiful people.

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:47.301
We have to make this world beautiful through your own help and through your attention.

00:07:47.573 --> 00:07:54.553
Now the problem is that people take to wrong things very easily even after Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:56.640
Don’t support anyone like that.

00:07:56.877 --> 00:08:03.031
On the contrary, explain to that person that Sahaja Yoga is a collective activity.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.030
We cannot have our own anything.

00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:08.298
We have to be active.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.669
We have to be together all the time.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:18.420
Togetherness is very important and then to seek joy of that togetherness.

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:24.733
If you can feel that joy of togetherness,

00:08:25.803 --> 00:08:29.233
you have achieved that aim of life

00:08:29.545 --> 00:08:37.214
becausethen you’ll gather other people also and give them this joy of being the Spirit.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.679
Once they become the Spirit, it starts changing.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.459
But if you are collective and if you are together

00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:49.850
and you do all the things, then also you grow very much.

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:52.889
Now, those who talk of separating,

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:59.696
having some sort of a mad ideas – please don’t listen to them.

00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:02.941
You better check.
Tell them, “We have to be together."

00:09:03.097 --> 00:09:06.060
We cannot, we cannot separate.

00:09:06.321 --> 00:09:08.647
And anything like this will be destroyed.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:11.314
Because in this world, you see,

00:09:11.497 --> 00:09:16.824
how the world is, how the things are and how it is working out.

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:24.079
So for you to understand the beauty of modern times, is that

00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:29.258
you are born in a time when you can be transformed.

00:09:29.605 --> 00:09:36.225
You are born in a time when you can become the Self, the Spirit.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.256
Everybody has tried this; nothing has worked out.

00:09:40.369 --> 00:09:44.973
Now, with the help of your Kundalini, we are working it out.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.660
You also know what is to be done.

00:09:48.747 --> 00:09:50.823
You know how to give realization,

00:09:51.169 --> 00:09:53.259
how to see the vibrations, everything.

00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:57.549
And once you start seeing that, then you will realize

00:09:57.668 --> 00:10:02.088
that what you are doing is a great harm to humanity.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.148
Now I leave upon you, all of you – you are such sensible,

00:10:06.323 --> 00:10:08.351
good people who have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:08.565 --> 00:10:11.401
and every time I came here, you were all here.

00:10:11.508 --> 00:10:16.929
I’m happy so many countries are here only just knowing that I am coming.

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:19.335
How much you all love Me, I tell you.

00:10:19.462 --> 00:10:21.097
Really, it’s remarkable.

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.730
All you people have shown your love.

00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:29.012
All of you have come here all the way, when I am here for such a short time.

00:10:29.643 --> 00:10:32.998
So may God bless you all and have sense.

00:10:33.222 --> 00:10:38.954
Have sense in your head that you are now responsible [UNCLEAR]

00:10:39.184 --> 00:10:46.077
transforming  this world into a new world of very good people, spiritual people.

00:10:46.205 --> 00:10:53.858
So your responsibility is that, and as a result, what you have to do, you will know.

00:10:54.142 --> 00:10:56.921
You all have to be very responsible.

00:10:57.215 --> 00:11:01.430
Whatever country you may come, whatever place you may come,

00:11:01.605 --> 00:11:06.528
but you have to be very, very responsible, responsible people,

00:11:06.687 --> 00:11:10.843
and try to understand what you are doing for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.006
I can see so many new faces now.

00:11:15.114 --> 00:11:16.715
I’m happy to see them.

00:11:17.111 --> 00:11:22.848
Of course most of the Austrians I have met and Germans I’ve met before, but I see also

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:27.550
other people from other countries –

00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:30.177
very sweet of them to have come.

00:11:30.568 --> 00:11:37.329
So what is important is to surrender, which is a problem with people.

00:11:37.702 --> 00:11:41.952
They cannot surrender themselves to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:45.393
That’s what is your life.

00:11:45.556 --> 00:11:50.227
That is the beautiful river of goodness.

00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:52.681
So you should try to surrender and

00:11:52.808 --> 00:11:57.040
if you cannot surrender, then there’s somethingwrong with you.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:12:00.698
Please try to surrender and you’ll be surprised

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.524
that with this surrendering only

00:12:03.713 --> 00:12:08.843
you can get complete joy, happiness and peace.

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:15.983
That is very important and that’s what I have come to tell you that please try to surrender.

00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:22.108
And surrendering is – I cannot say how you force yourself,

00:12:22.384 --> 00:12:26.416
but you just go into thoughtlessawareness.

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:33.277
You meditate and into thoughtless awareness and then I’m sure, with all My love

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:37.736
and with all My blessings, I’m sure you will surrender

00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:42.712
– not only surrender, but you will develop tremendous powers

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:48.492
to convert others also, to transform others into thisgood work.

00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:53.105
You all have that and if you just develop and try to find out

00:12:53.222 --> 00:12:57.875
how many people you have helped really in life to change.

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.750
Thank you very much.
