Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s Kingdom”
September 9, 1999 Cabella, Italia

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:13.609
Tonight we are going to worship Shri Krishna
as Virat.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:28.309
First is important to understand the incarnation
of Shri Krishna.

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:31.660
Krishna word comes from the word Krishi.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.910
Krishi means agriculture.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.940
He’s sown the seeds of spirituality.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.670
And for that, first of all, He had to think,
“Where are we as far as spirituality is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.590
concerned, how is the land?”

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:08.139
So what had happened at the time of Shri Rama
that He created lots of maryadas and by these

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:13.690
maryadas people started mentally thinking
about it, “I am not supposed to do that,

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.630
I am not supposed to do this.”

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.610
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.350
As a result people became extremely serious.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.410
They wouldn’t talk much and they wouldn’t
laugh; they wouldn’t enjoy anything.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:43.919
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:57.670
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:07.450
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:20.540
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:31.950
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:48.920
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.910
but he’s absolutely detached.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:09.920
And this detached person doesn’t take to
any grievances, jealousies, all these things.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.050
That He told.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.580
But how to achieve it He never told.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.479
And the second thing He described is that
you must work.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.479
You have to work.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:33.720
After all, you have got all the human tendencies
– is to work.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.819
But the fruit of the work, you leave it at
the Lotus Feet of God or you may call the

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.690
divine Power.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.050
This is another trick of His, because He realized
how human beings were twisted and how they

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.050
had a ego.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.000
If you tell them something, how they’ll
misinterpret it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.220
So He took the other way round, that tell
them something absurd.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:16.430
Now whatever work you do, your ego is intact
and with that ego, you can never give it up

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.980
at the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.770
So He made a impossible situation, that after
some time people will realize that this cannot

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:37.280
be done and they’ll give up this idea of
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.870
Divine.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.040
This was the one how He prepared the land.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:50.980
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.390
Flowers, fruit and water.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.960
Whatever you offer Me, I will take it.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.740
I’ll take it.”

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.920
But when you do that, when you do that you
must have ananya bhakti.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:24.970
Ananya means completely single-minded bhakti,
when there is not the other.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.810
This is only possible after realization.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:38.780
Only after realization you can put the fruits
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:47.060
And only after Self-realization you can have
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.960
is singular.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.000
These absurd conditions He put for human beings
because they were so much complicated.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.420
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.420
“How?”

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.130
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:19.190
We are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.190
singing.”

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.690
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:36.380
But it is the way He wanted to neutralize
the absurdities of human beings, that they

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.770
thought this was the bhakti.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.200
Which is not.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.810
Ananya bhakti is only possible when you are
realized soul, when you are connected with

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.010
the Divine, when there’s not the other.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:07:00.240
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.870
on their stupidity.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.620
Because He thought that “If I tell them
directly do like this, do like that, then

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.950
they’ll say, ‘Of course we did it, and
still we never achieved it.’”

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:21.290
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:28.700
For one month they walk in rags, singing the
songs and on the way they go on eating food

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.930
at different places.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.660
According to them this is ananya bhakti, and
they achieve nothing.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:44.960
They have become very sick and very tired
and have a very bad old age.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.250
But who can tell them?

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.710
They are all lost in it.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:59.610
So this is a way one could tackle human beings
to show their stupidity.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.560
And so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.990
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.160
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:23.840
We can say He’s the One who was like a very
great agriculturist.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.770
So His name was Krishi – Krishna.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.530
There are so many things I have told you about
Him: how His name came as Krishna, then as

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:41.550
how He was called as Radha, who was Radha,
who was Krishna and all those things.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:50.290
But when He talked of these things also He
told that you should become Sthitapragya.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.560
That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.880
Gyana means knowledge.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.870
So, you should get absolute knowledge.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.880
That He didn’t say how.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.280
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.480
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.460
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:24.020
He thought by doing all these things in a
stupid manner, they might develop a discretion

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.670
to know that this is not the way you can achieve
anything.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.030
You have to get your Self-realization.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.210
Discretion was very important.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:45.740
At this juncture, when we are facing a sort
of a challenge of this new millennium – that

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.880
the whole world is going to be destroyed and
all those things people are talking – it

00:09:50.880 --> 00:10:02.380
is really very important to know through discretion
what is good and what is bad.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.420
One may talk of something as very good, something
as very bad.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.382
But the divine Discretion is very, very different.

00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:17.480
Very different and which acts by Itself.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.780
Once you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.780
want to do it.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.350
I’ll give you My example.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:36.980
We went to buy a house and the fellow was,
you see, like a beggar he came.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.770
He said, “We have nothing.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.310
We have no food.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.450
They have taken away all our things and we
are just absolutely starving.”

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:57.150
When they said that, when he said that “We
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.150
pity for him.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.050
I said, “All right, increase the price.”

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.190
First we increased the price.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.560
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.240
Still we increased the price.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.590
I told My husband, “You increase the price.”

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.910
Though reluctantly, he increased the price.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.560
Third time again we increased the price.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.510
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:27.100
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.”

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:32.120
I just left them and sat in the car – at
the right moment.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.660
That was not such a good proposition or anything.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.570
But I could see they, I’m buying it out
of My pity; you may call it compassion.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:49.900
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.370
out of it.”

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:58.080
So this divine Discretion is a very, very
important thing, which we should see how it

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.530
works and should be satisfied with it.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:08.640
Not to feel bad, that you have missed a chance
or anything, but you must feel very happy

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:16.220
that this thing has happened and that your
divine discretion has taken on.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:23.230
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.230
have done something wrong.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.870
But if it is divine, ultimately it will turn
out to be very good.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.850
I gave you a very basic example.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:43.670
But that is also very true when you practice
Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:53.280
The discretion of divine Discretion is extremely
important to play a very great part in our

00:12:53.280 --> 00:13:02.700
lives, because this divine Discretion gives
us the real joy of our being, of our self,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.730
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:13.140
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:20.650
But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama,
He didn’t know how to do it.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:28.499
So to give people joy He said, “All right,
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,

00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:37.010
all sorts of things,” and with that He really
originated many things which were sort of

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.880
not serious.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.140
May look frivolous, but in that there was
joy expressing.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:52.831
All that He did to give them a full idea as
for a Sahaja yogi or for a, you can say, for

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:59.500
a self realized soul, what should be the attitude
towards everything.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:08.910
But it is not that you have to do it, but
it just works out, it is like that, that in

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:13.680
the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.680
Enjoyment.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:23.560
And that is what His idea was, to create a
sense of joy among people.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.470
Many people – there are lots of critics
– have criticized this part of His life.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.370
According to them, religion means you should
become just old.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:38.360
At the age of twenty years you should become
an old man of eighty years – something like

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:43.300
that, funny ideas of religious achievement.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.170
But He talked of joy and He never talked of
renunciation.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:57.660
He never talked that “You give up your family,
you give up your children, you give up everything,”

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.120
never, never.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.220
He said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.640
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.460
With attachment you can never enjoy.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.870
If you are attached to something, you cannot
enjoy anything in a full way.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.999
Like, supposing you are attached to your child.

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:25.940
Very simple thing, you are attached to your
child.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.680
You’re attached to your child, then you
will be bothered about things which should

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.430
not be there, which will not give joy to the
child either.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:42.810
You’ll not allow your child, say, to go
out or to talk to people, whatever it is – all

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.650
kinds of restrictions you will put.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:54.290
But if you have really the divine discretion,
then you will know with whom he should talk,

00:15:54.290 --> 00:16:02.830
where he should go, what he should enjoy and
you will see that he enjoys life.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:11.110
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.840
thing.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:22.870
If you are detached, then you can see it,
say, from above … above him, above the thing.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:27.140
If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.730
As I said, now, see the carpets are there.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.110
They are very, very beautiful carpets.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:40.070
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:47.340
because I am attached – that these carpets
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.640
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at
those carpets and what do I see?

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.900
The joy.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.140
The joy that is put in by the artist who has
made them.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:06.410
And that joy really tries to reflect in Me
also.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.369
That joy comes in Me.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:18.750
So to have anything, attachment to anything,
there will be joy … I should say there’ll

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.310
be happiness but not joy.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:30.990
Because joy is single and happiness is double
– happiness and unhappiness.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:35.790
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.430
is there.”

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.390
But joy is all pervading.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.890
It has no boundaries.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.880
And you just get dissolved, you get dissolved
in the ocean of joy.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:56.540
That was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that
cut out these maryadas.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:02.690
Nowadays we see the maryadas of so many things
are really useless.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:08.000
For example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.170
See when they live in maryadas then what happens?

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:23.719
They sort of coggle it or they have all kinds
of germination inside like the pond, which

00:18:23.719 --> 00:18:29.540
is absolutely bound, it is not flowing like
river.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:40.770
So like that, you see, it becomes a kind of
a closed mind with these maryadas.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:48.100
And when you have this maryadas, you start
thinking, “Whether I should do it or not;

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.790
whether I’ll enjoy it or not.”

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:55.740
With these maryadas only, you kill the joy.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:01.840
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:08.710
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.860
things of their religion, they cannot come.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.740
They think, “This is our religion,” while
they don’t understand.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:24.140
Falsehood becomes the maryadas and they don’t
understand that what is the maryada actually

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.250
made by the religion also.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.810
You see now in Islam what is happening is.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:38.120
With these maryadas, they want to have another
country, this thing, that thing.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.580
In other Christian religion also same thing
happening.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.240
Also in Hindu religion.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:49.969
All these maryadas are really stagnating them
completely, and they are getting crushed into

00:19:49.969 --> 00:19:51.089
it.

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:54.450
There’s no discretion.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.130
Because they have said it, they do it.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:04.820
They are so much blind-folded about it, that
they cannot see what is right and what is

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.820
wrong.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.510
But after Sahaj, you can see, you can laugh
at them and you can see.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:16.880
Then we have social maryadas.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:23.990
Social maryadas are there which are sometimes,
when abandoned can become very horrid also.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:31.320
Like in the West now, the women think that
the less dress they wear, the more beautiful

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320
they are.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.690
This is a new thing they have started.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.790
Now this absurd.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:44.300
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:49.860
want to have any clothes because we were animals.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:56.260
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s
why so many women do not want to wear full

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.260
dresses.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.900
It’s just animal behavior.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:06.830
So the maryada of – good maryadas also people
can give up saying that “We don’t want

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:07.830
any maryadas.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.400
We are free; we can do whatever we like.”

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.970
But in that freedom what do you achieve?

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:22.280
Your animal instinct works in that freedom
and you think you are a very free personality.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.930
Then we have maryadas of our country.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.870
God has not made different, different countries
at all.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:33.450
Nor it is true there are different countries,
but variety is there.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.670
Variety of people, variety of places is there.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:45.910
These varieties must be accepted as something
very artistic and one should not get ruined

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:52.980
and confused with those ideas that “We are
Americans, we are Indians, we are this and

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.140
we are that.”

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.140
You’re not.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.600
Now you can know after Sahaja Yoga, that you
are all Sahaja yogis and you don’t belong

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.839
to any country as such.

00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:06.209
The country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:14.730
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:23.100
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:28.790
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:34.380
All over the world there’s going on, “We
want this land; we want that land.”

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.060
Land belongs to God, not to human beings.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.589
And what is the use of fighting for land?

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:42.380
I don’t understand.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.460
But this confusion is there and illusion is
there.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.800
And people work out on this confusion and
illusion to such an extent that they ruin

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.280
their lives, the lives of their children.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:01.280
So many people are lost, so many people are
in the lunatic asylum, I should say, because

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:05.200
they end up in some sort of a refugee camp.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.690
They are having a good house, nicely living
there.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.010
Then you become a refugee.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.510
Why?

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:21.590
Because they believe that they can have their
own land, they can have their own place and

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.680
they should live there.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.230
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.570
lands and that’s how people fight for land.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:40.671
There’s no need to fight for land or fight
for your country or fight for this or fight

00:23:40.671 --> 00:23:41.940
for that.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:49.089
But the situation is such that unless and
until you fight, you cannot get to the truth.

00:23:49.089 --> 00:23:56.670
And that’s why if you remember that Shri
Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:57.670
Fight.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.719
You have to fight, that’s your work.

00:23:59.719 --> 00:24:05.740
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.760
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:17.969
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

00:24:17.969 --> 00:24:19.740
what they deserved.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:27.740
They were deceived, and this is what Shri
Krishna said that “You should not by any

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:37.170
chance become a slave of these people, but
you fight it back.”

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:42.270
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:48.089
Is again the divine discretion where you have
to fight because you don’t want to be a

00:24:48.089 --> 00:24:49.140
slave.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.589
If you are a slave, you are no good.

00:24:51.589 --> 00:24:53.500
So for that you can fight.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:25:01.780
But when people start fighting for separation
of a territory, is not correct.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:06.860
On the contrary, one should never think of
separating from the main lands.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.839
Because it creates lots of problems.

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:14.630
But now we believe in the global religion.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.450
We believe in the global territory.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.770
We don’t have to ask for anything.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.350
Anywhere you go, you are the citizen of that
place.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:28.900
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the
whole Russians will be with you.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.880
You go to America, they’ll be with you.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:37.730
That’s how because all these are ideas of
human beings, and if the human beings get

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:46.130
transformed there will be no problem of any
war or any territory to be achieved.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:53.620
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:26:04.380
As you know that this is a part and parcel
of the Vishuddhi Chakra, where Shri Krishna

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:14.400
resides; but when He rises to your Sahasrara,
when He rises to that level, then He becomes

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.330
Virata.

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:30.440
So Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head,
here above the Agnya, and this Virat is the

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:37.790
form of Shri Krishna who has risen above the
Agnya.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:46.730
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.140
say.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:56.860
Because, unless and until you are above your
ego, you are still involved with yourself

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.630
and with wrong ideas of maryadas.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:07.640
But when you rise above that and you become
the Virat, the great, then you are in the

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.070
land of Virata.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.110
And Virata’s powers are tremendous.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.510
Has been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:24.410
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:37.390
It acts in such a manner that you sit here
and anywhere it can act.

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.430
You have seen that now.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.390
Many a times people say, “Mother it’s
a miracle.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:49.959
My mother was sick and she was not here and
I just prayed and she got all right.”

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:53.930
This is all the power of Virat.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:28:02.510
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.440
a manner that everything we are connected
with.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.130
We are not separate.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.560
And every drop is connected with the ocean.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.610
We are connected with the whole universe.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:27.381
And when you become a citizens, I should say,
of Virat, then all the things with which you

00:28:27.381 --> 00:28:38.910
are connected also get your vibrations, your
ideas, your ambitions.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:44.250
Everything passes through that and it works
– it works.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.250
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.160
It is the Virata Shakti that works.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:29:02.850
Now for that we have to know how to do worship
of Virata.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:10.920
First of all you have to rise above your ego
– very important.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.959
Otherwise how can you worship?

00:29:13.959 --> 00:29:24.339
There is your ego standing in between and
how can you rise up to the point of Virat?

00:29:24.339 --> 00:29:27.560
You have to pass through that.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:35.350
Once you are above your ego, you enter into
the kingdom of Virata.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:44.790
There the King is the Virat and you are the
subject who are looked after completely by

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.400
Virata Shakti, by the power of Virata.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:55.630
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:03.060
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.930
to you.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.260
Supposing a person is of that level.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:15.400
Now there may be a war in some other country
– it can stop.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.530
Somebody who is being oppressed can win over.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.720
Anywhere your compassion moves it works out.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.320
Whenever your attention will go, it will work
out.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:32.210
And sometimes you are surprised as to how
it works, “Mother, how these things work

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.210
out?

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.980
How coincidences … how these coincidences
have taken place?”

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:46.000
Only thing is you have crossed that state
of your ego and have gone into the state of

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.709
Virat, which is a very important thing to
do – is to enter into the area of Virata.

00:30:54.709 --> 00:30:57.079
Then you don’t think, “This is your country.

00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:59.459
This belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

00:30:59.459 --> 00:31:02.290
This belonging business finishes off.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.560
Then you belong to Virat.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:12.910
And He uses you for His own purpose in the
sense that when your whole thinking is different

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:18.250
– becomes global thinking, then He acts.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.630
And then His powers are many-fold.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:28.079
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch
to call people.

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:31.459
I have given conches to all the leaders.

00:31:31.459 --> 00:31:37.130
So we have to now announce and call people.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:45.079
But at the level of Virat, you don’t have
to do all that.

00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:53.220
At the level of Virat it just – people see,
they’ll know.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.250
Just they will watch you and they will know.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:05.150
Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.710
shining all the time.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.940
So, they’ll be impressed.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.380
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:20.660
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:27.740
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.250
are actually not true.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:36.839
And all these things on which you want to
exist are no more.

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:47.300
People like to show off their wealth, some
people like to be very sort of demonstrative

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.690
of what they think they are.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:33:01.060
But in the case of a person who rises above
his ego, and he’s a part and parcel of that

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:08.100
Virata shakti, enters into the kingdom of
Virata, he knows he is very small.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:15.640
He is very small compared to that and he just
dissolves into that Shakti.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.219
And this should happen to us that we should
humble down.

00:33:19.219 --> 00:33:29.441
We should humble down and know that our powers,
whatever we have, if they give us ego, we

00:33:29.441 --> 00:33:31.260
should get rid of it.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.260
We should not have that ego.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:41.390
We should get rid of it and we should actually
achieve that state where you can be called

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.640
as citizens of the Virata’s Power.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.160
May God bless you all.

00:35:53.236 --> 00:35:56.835
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have to be like children.

00:35:57.706 --> 00:35:59.656
You are children there.

00:36:00.206 --> 00:36:02.146
As children you enter.

00:36:02.516 --> 00:36:12.966
As Christ has said, “When you enter into
the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.”

00:36:13.006 --> 00:36:19.356
And that’s what you have to be today, all
of you to be innocent like children.

00:36:19.406 --> 00:36:22.336
You have to be innocent like children.
