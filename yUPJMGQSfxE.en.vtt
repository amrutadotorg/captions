00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.389
My idea of coming to Pandharpur
for Shiva Puja was this:

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.097
that Shiva represents the Spirit,

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:29.038
and the Spirit is residing in all of you
in your hearts.

00:00:33.425 --> 00:00:38.540
The seat of Sadashiva is on top
of your head

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.665
but is reflected in your heart.

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:52.242
Now, your brain is the Vitthala.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.738
So to bring Spirit to your brain

00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:06.333
means enlightenment of your brain.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.712
Enlightenment of your brain means

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:21.137
the limited capacity of your brain
has to become unlimited,

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:29.214
in its capacity to realize God.

00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:33.413
I will not use the word 'understand'
- but 'to realize God' -

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:36.622
how powerful He is,

00:01:36.702 --> 00:01:41.301
how miraculous He is, how great He is.

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:50.124
The another is that the brain of man

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:55.716
can create - of course, out of the dead;

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.451
but when the Spirit comes into brain,

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:10.437
then you create living things,

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:15.869
living work of Kundalini.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.990
Even the dead start behaving like living

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.674
because you touch the Spirit in the dead.

00:02:29.377 --> 00:02:34.379
Like the nucleus

00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:42.392
inside every atom or a molecule

00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:47.234
has the Spirit of that molecule.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.085
And if you become your Spirit...

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:56.091
We can say the brain of

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:01.718
a molecule or an atom

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:05.254
is like the nucleus, body of the nucleus.

00:03:05.334 --> 00:03:08.419
But the one that controls the nucleus
is the Spirit

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.379
that resides within the nucleus.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.066
So now you have got the attention,
or the body

00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:24.694
- the whole body of the atom - then
the nucleus,

00:03:24.774 --> 00:03:27.877
and inside the nucleus is the Spirit.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:33.470
In the same way - we have this body,
the attention of the body.

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:41.982
And then we have the...

00:03:43.902 --> 00:03:49.108
we have the nucleus

00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:55.198
- is the brain.

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.959
And the Spirit is in the heart.

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:10.201
So the brain is controlled through
the Spirit.

00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:13.158
How?

00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:18.920
That around the heart

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:23.220
there are seven auras

00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:30.551
which can be multiplied into any number,

00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.247
seven raised to power sixteen hundred,

00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:41.711
which are the ones

00:04:43.827 --> 00:04:50.771
which watch the seven chakras,

00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:54.338
raised to power sixteen hundred -

00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:57.887
sixteen thousand, sorry.

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:08.657
Now this Spirit is watching through
this aura;

00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:15.278
watching - I am again saying “watching”
- through this aura.

00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:18.254
Can you sit down?

00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:25.913
Can you sit down? I think, would be
better.

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:31.365
There is no need to bother, once you
have put it up.

00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:38.752
This aura is watching

00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:46.381
the behaviour of your seven centres
in your brain.

00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:52.053
Is also watching all the nerves
that are working

00:05:52.133 --> 00:05:55.672
in the brain - “watching”, again.

00:05:56.148 --> 00:06:00.337
But when you bring the Spirit

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:07.405
into your brain,

00:06:09.263 --> 00:06:13.088
then you go two steps ahead,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.384
because when your Kundalini rises,

00:06:21.827 --> 00:06:30.024
She touches the Sadashiva
and Sadashiva informs the Spirit.

00:06:30.104 --> 00:06:34.956
Informs in the sense - reflects
in the Spirit.

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:42.862
So that's the first state where
the watching auras

00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:49.266
start communicating

00:06:50.614 --> 00:06:57.666
through your different chakras
in the brain

00:06:57.746 --> 00:07:01.045
and integrating it.

00:07:02.117 --> 00:07:06.587
But when you bring your Spirit
to your brain

00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:10.236
- this is the second state -

00:07:12.957 --> 00:07:18.151
then you really become self-realized,
in the full way,

00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:24.427
in the full way because then your Self,
that is the Spirit,

00:07:24.507 --> 00:07:28.867
becomes your brain.

00:07:29.695 --> 00:07:33.333
Action is very dynamic,

00:07:33.413 --> 00:07:40.320
it opens then the fifth dimension
in the human being.

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:47.687
First, when you become realized,
collectively conscious,

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:55.080
and start raising the Kundalini, you are
in, you cross the fourth dimension.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.575
But when your Spirit comes into
your brain,

00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:07.646
then you become the fifth dimension
- means, you become the doer.

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:16.222
Our brain, now, for example, says,
"All right, lift this thing up."

00:08:16.302 --> 00:08:22.186
So you touch it with your hand,
you lift it up. You are the doer.

00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:29.120
But when the brain becomes the Spirit,
the Spirit is the doer,

00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:34.946
and when Spirit is the doer,

00:08:36.736 --> 00:08:40.390
then you become

00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:47.528
a complete Shiva - self-realized.

00:08:48.426 --> 00:08:54.435
In that state, if you get angry,

00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:58.518
you are not attached.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:04.644
You are not an attached person to anything
whatsoever.

00:09:05.703 --> 00:09:08.538
If you possess anything, you are
not attached.

00:09:08.618 --> 00:09:12.879
You cannot attach because Spirit
is detachment,

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.599
is complete detachment.

00:09:15.909 --> 00:09:22.096
You don't bother about any attachments
whatsoever.

00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:25.486
Even for a second, you are not attached.
