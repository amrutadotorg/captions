1
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:33,346
It is such a joy to see so many Sahaja yogis

2
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:43,960
of such high evolution.

3
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:52,961
I'm sure all the gods and goddesses and the God Almighty Himself

4
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:58,441
must be overjoyed to see this achievement, no doubt about it.

5
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:04,801
But I was told that you want to know

6
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:09,161
higher ways or higher things

7
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:15,681
by which you would like to ascend higher and higher.

8
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:21,161
In the samadhi state first is the thoughtless awareness as you know,

9
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:23,960
called the Nirvichara Samadhi.

10
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:30,041
And then into the other state which is called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi

11
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:32,681
where it is doubtless awareness,

12
00:01:32,881 --> 00:01:37,641
is two stages, Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa.

13
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:42,281
Most of the Sahaja Yogis now, are on the Savikalpa,

14
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,121
not yet at the Nirvikalpa,

15
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:49,321
and to rise up to the Nirvikalpa

16
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:55,241
we must understand that we have to do little more about it.

17
00:01:55,921 --> 00:02:01,361
So far we had our physical problems, which are solved.

18
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:10,281
Physical needs, comforts cannot dominate us anymore.

19
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:14,721
We can live in any conditions, like Brahmapuri.

20
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,881
We enjoy all that. That shows that we have now risen above

21
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:24,561
the conditions that are laid down

22
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:29,081
by the material life or the matter.

23
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,481
That's a good state where we have reached,

24
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,161
which is also very difficult for people.

25
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,761
Normally, people are extremely fussy;

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,361
they are worried about worldly things, worldly possessions,

27
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,961
worldly material problems.

28
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:46,121
So many of them would come and tell Me,

29
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,521
"I haven't got this job, I haven't got that job.

30
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:51,761
This is to be done, that is to be done."

31
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,881
Then the second subtler attachment

32
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:59,921
is to our emotional side,

33
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:05,960
like my mother, like my brother, my sister, my wife, my children.

34
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:12,201
And we go on bothering Sahaja Yoga for that,

35
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,401
that my friend should be cured, my brother should be cured,

36
00:03:15,601 --> 00:03:17,681
my sister should be cured.

37
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:22,361
That's a very subtle thing we do not understand,

38
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:28,321
that in the realm of God those who enter can only be benefited,

39
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:31,321
not those who do not enter into that.

40
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:35,121
For example, if you have a relation living in India,

41
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:43,321
you cannot send him the benefits

42
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:47,441
of an Australian citizen. So first of all we must know

43
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,921
that they have to be the citizens of God's realm.

44
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,761
So unless and until we give them Realization,

45
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:58,960
take them to that level, they are not entitled.

46
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:04,881
So we should not have any obstinacy about it, no obstinacy.

47
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:07,321
Many of you have overcome that part

48
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:15,921
that you are not attached to a particular type of a relationship

49
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,521
who are not in Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,801
Many of you have got out of it.

51
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:26,201
But then how to overcome higher attachments?

52
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:29,241
Like there are attachments

53
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:34,521
that "I should write a book on Sahaja Yoga"

54
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,041
or "I should",

55
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:46,481
"I should paint something for Sahaja Yoga",

56
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:50,721
"I must earn for Sahaja Yoga", "I must do this for Sahaja Yoga".

57
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,841
This is also, in a very subtle way is ego,

58
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,801
that "I should be the leader of Sahaja Yoga".

59
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,841
Then there are jealousies.

60
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,761
If Mother says this is not good, you feel hurt.

61
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,521
If Mother says this is good, you feel happy.

62
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:09,641
That means you are still at a very subtler state of ego

63
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:15,281
where you think, that whatever you say should be approved by Me.

64
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:21,161
That is something is very subtle, and we do not understand

65
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:24,201
that if Mother is not approving of it, there must be

66
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,201
basic divine reason,

67
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:29,641
otherwise why should I not approve of it?

68
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:34,121
So when you have such subtler attachments also,

69
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,561
of a higher level we should say,

70
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,521
you must know that it's all the work of God

71
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:43,321
and we are just channels in the hands of God.

72
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:50,481
Now, we have a very good example, as I have told you many a times,

73
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:55,041
of the little cell at the tip of the root of a tree,

74
00:05:55,241 --> 00:06:01,521
how it is so wise to avoid whatever is hard

75
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:07,921
and to take to whatever is soft and to embed the tree into the soil.

76
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:13,041
It has that innate wisdom with which we also are endowed.

77
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,401
And we have to work it out in such a way

78
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:20,001
that we do not get involved

79
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:24,161
into anything which is extremely hard.

80
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,641
Like, I would say, some people wanted to go to Tasmania.

81
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:31,001
By My hint I told them, "Don't go. It won't work out.

82
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:34,121
Tasmania is not a place where you can achieve anything."

83
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,361
I knew it was impossible.

84
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,681
But they thought they are going to do Sahaja Yoga great job,

85
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,081
so they went there.

86
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:44,241
They came back all possessed in a bad shape,

87
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:47,201
and then I had to get them all right.

88
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:52,601
So now you people don't misunderstand Me so much, as you used to,

89
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:57,121
but still you do things which should not be done.

90
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:05,161
To understand that whatever I tell you is for your ascent,

91
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,681
you need a kind of a state of mind,

92
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:11,401
a state of mind which is a detached mind.

93
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:16,121
And the detachment is visible,

94
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,961
very clear-cut in a person

95
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,481
that he's neither very emotionally attached

96
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:26,161
or he is neither, nor very physically attached

97
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:30,761
but he sees that the progress

98
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,801
of himself and of the society is the point.

99
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,721
Like the cell,

100
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,721
knows it has to progress for the betterment of the tree

101
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:44,521
but it has innate wisdom to do it in such a way

102
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,201
that it never harms himself

103
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:54,321
or does not harm the tree.

104
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:58,841
So the progress of a mind

105
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,881
which wants to develop, has to be such

106
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:06,401
that you should move with a balance, with a witness state,

107
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:10,201
and see for yourself how far you should go

108
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:15,681
and how far you should not go.

109
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:23,761
Going to extremes is not Sahaja Yoga style. Ascent is.

110
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,641
So even if you find somewhere,

111
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,681
you go and find that there is no response,

112
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:35,801
then you must know that it is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:40,961
nothing wrong with you, but perhaps

114
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,121
you have not approached the right place

115
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,521
or you have not approached the right way,

116
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,161
you have not done the way it should have been.

117
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,201
So change your style.

118
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:54,041
In Sahaja Yoga we have to go on changing our directions

119
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,441
according to the need of the hour.

120
00:08:56,721 --> 00:09:00,201
You are not fixed quantity, rigid quantity

121
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:03,601
Most of the people think that we are so rigid

122
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:08,841
that we cannot move this side or that side.

123
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:17,001
The mobility of our movement is so great,

124
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:20,001
I say 360 degrees.

125
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:25,401
Because you are stationed in the center in your Spirit.

126
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,961
You can move anyway you like

127
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:30,641
as long as you are centered in your Spirit.

128
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,001
But this is an important point which we miss

129
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,921
that we are centered in our Spirit.

130
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,481
And whatever movement we do,

131
00:09:38,681 --> 00:09:41,761
as long as we are centered in the Spirit,

132
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:48,161
is necessary for our growth and for the growth of the collective.

133
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,321
Now let us see certain emotional sides we have,

134
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:55,161
how we can conquer. It's very simple is.

135
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,081
You are very fortunate, I should say, in a way,

136
00:09:57,281 --> 00:10:00,361
than any other seeker so far

137
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,960
because you have before Me Myself sitting.

138
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,521
I am sitting before Myself and I see Myself

139
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:11,281
as a good example of following.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
When you have someone like that, it's very simple to see.

141
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:22,481
People didn't have any such people or some leaders

142
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:26,041
or somebody who was an ideal.

143
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,641
So, it was all right that they went wrong.

144
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:34,081
But those who have something before them, that's very simple.

145
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,401
The secret is like this,

146
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:44,841
now when you are subtly attached to something,

147
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:49,921
so to say an emotional side of something

148
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:53,561
or you always like to be on the negative side

149
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,281
or too much of a positive side

150
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,960
in the sense that you aggress others,

151
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:05,361
then you must discriminate.

152
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:10,401
If it is an aggressiveness that you see in yourself,

153
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:13,801
witness within yourself, then you aggress yourself.

154
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,361
That is the best way to get rid of it.

155
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,001
If you are a hot-tempered person,

156
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:21,241
better get angry with yourself at least ten times

157
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:24,921
and then you will see that your temper will mellow down,

158
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:29,201
because all that is coming out will be directed towards yourself.

159
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,441
Now this is the discrimination you have to use

160
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:33,601
and be honest about it.

161
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:38,081
The another side could be that you are very left-sided, emotional,

162
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,960
extremely emotional about things and you cannot get over.

163
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:47,241
Then that's the best. Divert your emotions to Me,

164
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:51,401
put your emotions to Me, but do not aggress Me.

165
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,761
This is the discretion you have to use.

166
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,761
When you have aggression, you aggress yourself

167
00:11:56,961 --> 00:12:00,721
and when you have emotional attachments, direct it.

168
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,321
It's very simple to do.

169
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:07,401
What pleases Mother? Very simple things. What does it please Her?

170
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:11,361
Very simple things pleases Her, like flowers.

171
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:15,281
Now people say that, "We were going in the garden, Mother.

172
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,841
We found these flowers for You." Is good idea.

173
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,001
But how much attention you have put to it

174
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,681
that we have to give a flower to Mother.

175
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:27,881
Now what flowers She likes? She likes fragrant flowers. All right.

176
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,960
From where should we get the fragrant flower? It's very simple.

177
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:35,641
It's a shop. When you are going around, be on the look-out.

178
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:38,561
There must be some shop with fragrant flowers.

179
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,681
In those months what flowers come in?

180
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,681
What flower am I going to give to Mother?

181
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,321
The whole direction changes.

182
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:47,161
You see, you become so beautifully attached to Me,

183
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:49,041
and I have to gain nothing out of it

184
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:52,241
but by attaching yourself to Me, you gain something.

185
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:54,401
Like the river Ganges flows,

186
00:12:54,601 --> 00:12:56,561
and if you dip in the River Ganges,

187
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,601
the poor river Ganges doesn't get anything

188
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:01,721
but you get the blessings of river Ganges.

189
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:04,681
In the same way you have to think

190
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:09,001
that if we have to attach ourselves to Mother,

191
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,681
we must put our attention completely, entirely to it.

192
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:17,201
Little, little things you do. What should I do for my Mother?

193
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,641
How should I please? Is not what you give Me is important.

194
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,241
It is how much heart you put into it.

195
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:28,121
You know the story of Shabari. She was a very simple woman,

196
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:31,721
an old lady with very few teeth.

197
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:34,721
When Rama was coming she said, "What should I give to Shri Ram?"

198
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:38,921
All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest,

199
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:44,841
some small little what we call berries, ber, and she thought,

200
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,681
"It may not be sweet for my Rama. How will I give Him?"

201
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:51,881
So she picked them up. She used to test it with her teeth.

202
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,641
One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet.

203
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:58,441
And then she would collect those

204
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:02,241
and those who were bad she threw away.

205
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,641
When Shri Ram came, she said,

206
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,881
"Shri Ram, I couldn't get anything but these for You.

207
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:13,961
Will you have it?" Now, Shri Rama, being an incarnation,

208
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:19,041
knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand.

209
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:24,921
He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart.

210
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:30,121
So she says, "This I have tasted each one of them.

211
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:33,561
Don't have any doubts. I have tasted in every one of them.

212
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,841
They are all very sweet. You can have them."

213
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:40,921
So He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife,

214
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:44,641
"I have never eaten such beautiful fruits such great fruits before."

215
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,681
I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see.

216
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:51,361
Sitaji, His wife, being an incarnation Herself, She said,

217
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:53,921
"You must give Me some. After all, I am your Ardhangini" -

218
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:57,361
is the half, better half.

219
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:01,041
But Lakshmana was getting angry.

220
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:04,961
He said," Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such ..."

221
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:08,481
We don't eat things, you see, eaten by others; we call it tustha,

222
00:15:08,681 --> 00:15:11,321
is a uthistha, means if the one who has eaten something

223
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:13,601
is never given. And to Rama.

224
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:17,521
So he was very angry, fuming with temper.

225
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:20,761
So She takes it in Her hand and She tells Her brother-in-law,

226
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,601
"Oh, this is the best I've had, my brother-in-law.

227
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,321
I've never had such beautiful fruits."

228
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:31,361
Now he gets tempted and he says, "Really?

229
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,081
Can I have some?" She said, "No it's only for Me and My husband.

230
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,921
You better ask her." So He asks Shabari,

231
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,921
"Can you give Me some, please?"

232
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:46,641
The whole temper fizzles out and then He sees

233
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:51,961
the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love.

234
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:58,001
So this is what it is. Love which you have should be expanded.

235
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:01,561
And very simple. If you are attached to Me I am a person

236
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:07,361
who is so much spread out, all over. It goes into the whole,

237
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:13,241
it goes into the nature, it permeates everywhere.

238
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:17,761
Whatever love you give Me is not like a drop in a ocean

239
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,041
but is this ocean in a drop.

240
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,561
And that is what we must understand how to love Mother.

241
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:27,761
But when you love Me, you won't feel bad if I tell you something,

242
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,921
"This is not good for you, you should all not have done it,"

243
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:34,241
because if you want to be all right, you would say,

244
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:38,281
"All right, Mother, this was wrong. All right, I am sorry.

245
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,561
I'll never do this again."

246
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:44,561
This is a very simple way but it is a very difficult thing

247
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:47,161
for a human being. Is so simple.

248
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:51,960
I asked Warren that "Are they prepared to take up what I say?"

249
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:56,601
Then you will be surprised, when we are in love with someone,

250
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:59,801
we don't mind how we cross the roads, how we go there,

251
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,681
how we have to cross floods, this, that.

252
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:06,881
That force of love takes us there. In the same way,

253
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,401
the force of love for water,

254
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,721
for the whole tree, takes that little root - that innate wisdom

255
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:16,441
is nothing but the love he has for the whole tree -

256
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:21,401
that he goes to the water, sucks it in for that great tree.

257
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,881
It's not that it is important for the tree.

258
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:28,401
If there is no one tree, one root, doesn't matter.

259
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:34,601
But it is the wholesomeness of existence

260
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:38,761
that one feels when we become one with the whole.

261
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,801
And this wholesomeness is to be felt

262
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,921
and that's the greatest enjoyment.

263
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:45,801
The wholesomeness is to be felt within yourself.

264
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:48,681
Is the greatest enjoyment, and that is how

265
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,841
we progress higher and higher.

266
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,441
So the Savikalpa is this that we are still busy

267
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,841
with our relationships.

268
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,801
We, we notice that Mother has married us,

269
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:03,921
given us good husbands, good wives. We are very happily married

270
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:08,801
and we are enjoying our married life and we are looking forward

271
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:12,041
to greater marriages and better marriages.

272
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:15,281
But that's not the end of it, not at all.

273
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:18,521
This is just the beginning, just the start

274
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:21,681
and after this has happened,

275
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:25,041
if you get attached too much to it, then you have lost the point,

276
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:28,881
lost the point. The marriage has taken place.

277
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:32,401
Like an electricity, you see,

278
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:35,561
if you plug it to the mains,

279
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:40,961
it is not for getting attached to oneself,

280
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,081
but it is for the use of that instrument.

281
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,801
So the marriage is an instrument which is to be used,

282
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,121
which is to be completely understood

283
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:55,481
for the purpose of enlightening others.

284
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:03,721
So first thing is that Sahaja Yoga is our aim,

285
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:08,641
is our dharma, is our being.

286
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:12,281
That is the main thing. All the rest of the things come later.

287
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:15,361
Supposing then, you find your wife or your husband

288
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:18,121
are getting materialistic, better to depart.

289
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:22,001
Tell them, "No, we cannot." See, for Me this is important.

290
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,601
Marriage was just a means to an end. But the end is different.

291
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,401
So we can give up this means, we'll have another means.

292
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,041
And this is to be understood in its true color.

293
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:35,401
If your marriage doesn't give you progress in your spiritual life,

294
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:37,241
better to give it up.

295
00:19:37,481 --> 00:19:40,721
And that's what I have been telling everyone about it,

296
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:44,001
how to get over your emotional problem.

297
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:49,001
Some people have aggressiveness in them.

298
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:52,121
Now when they are aggressive

299
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:55,441
then what happens that some people ...

300
00:19:55,641 --> 00:20:00,960
I told you you'll get breeze; you are getting the breeze, all right.

301
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,641
And look at the shade.

302
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:12,401
You see how the nature, how the nature acts, how the nature helps.

303
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:17,161
Just look at the nature, how subservient it is. It enjoys that way.

304
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,281
You must have heard about what happened in Perth,

305
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:21,081
what happened everywhere.

306
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:25,281
See, the nature is so subservient. Why? What is the need?

307
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:30,921
Because it gets the blessings. It gets the beauty of wholesomeness,

308
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:34,521
of doing something for the whole. This is the wholesomeness.

309
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:38,001
The wholesomeness of the whole job is to be understood

310
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:41,721
and when it is understood, then only you realize

311
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,201
the beauty of you being Sahaja yogis.

312
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:48,241
Otherwise you just, for a limited thing, ”I got married,

313
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:50,921
I am much better, I got rid of my bad habits".

314
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,721
That's not sufficient.

315
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,561
The quality of wholesomeness, when is experienced within ourselves,

316
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:00,121
then only that joy comes in.

317
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,121
So we go up to a point and then we recede.

318
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:07,121
Like the sea, it goes up to a point and then recedes.

319
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:10,121
It does not go beyond a certain point.

320
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:13,241
It has its own maryadas. It knows how far to go.

321
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:17,441
But what does it do? It ascends as clouds.

322
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:22,361
It purifies itself, ascends as clouds and then meets

323
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,521
the Himalayas and then you get the rain

324
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:29,081
for the benefit all the others. It's a big circle that is made

325
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:33,161
and the wholesomeness of that circle is realized by the sea.

326
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:35,201
In the same way, you must know that

327
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:38,361
you are in that great circle of nature

328
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:42,041
where you have to play your own part in a full way,

329
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,321
and once you realize that mentally,

330
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:47,161
you should put it in your heart, the way I've said it.

331
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:50,721
Because to put it in the heart for some people is very difficult.

332
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,801
Like, they'll do My Puja, all right,

333
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:57,481
is mechanically, but some people may not even do any Puja,

334
00:21:57,681 --> 00:22:02,481
they sit before the photograph and talk to Me heart-to-heart,

335
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:04,521
without saying anything.

336
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:07,241
And even in puja, when I see people doing Puja,

337
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:11,681
I know how far they are dedicated because the way they do it

338
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:16,641
with caution, with care, with awe, with understanding.

339
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,361
Everything is so beautiful. But if somebody is doing

340
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:23,241
just a ritual thing, I get a fright. I just don't understand.

341
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:27,481
Now next time he might hit My Foot or something like that.

342
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:33,961
So one has to be all the time ascending.

343
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:38,161
Ascent has to be achieved and that ascent is only possible

344
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:41,361
when we start giving up all these ties and tags that we have.

345
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,841
These ties and tags keep us down.

346
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,041
So get over the ties and tags.

347
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,801
The other day I was telling Warren that, you see,

348
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,681
men and women after forty-five or fifty

349
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:56,721
still go on thinking of marriages. It is too much.

350
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:59,641
It's all right. After forty also one should be all right

351
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,921
but at least forty-five, fifty.

352
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,841
But even at sixty years somebody comes and says,

353
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:06,561
"Mother, get me married." Then I really get fed up.

354
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:11,081
As if My job is to get you married, like a clergyman.

355
00:23:11,281 --> 00:23:13,761
So this is not the way. What is in a marriage?

356
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,601
Some people are seeking their husbands all their lives.

357
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:21,761
When are you going to seek the real one that is your Spirit?

358
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,881
So that category of people have to come up

359
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:27,121
and work it out in that manner.

360
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:31,201
Then only our family, our relationships,

361
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:35,601
our society will have some meaning in the realm of God.

362
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:41,081
Otherwise, it has no meaning. We have to be meaningful to Him,

363
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:43,441
not that He should be meaningful to us.

364
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:45,401
We should change our attitude towards Him,

365
00:23:45,601 --> 00:23:47,801
that "What has God done for us? Let's see."

366
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:50,561
We should say, "What have we done for God?

367
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:53,121
What have we done for God?"

368
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:56,481
Then you will get ideas, what is to be done, how to spread out,

369
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:59,201
how to go ahead, how to work it out.

370
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:02,081
But still there are limitations, I know.

371
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:03,921
Some people have limitations.

372
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:06,561
They have limitations because they have a background.

373
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:10,121
Some of them come from countries which has a background.

374
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,281
And also the other one is that

375
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:17,121
the problem of these people, delimiting others.

376
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:20,081
When they come in contact with you, they try to delimit,

377
00:24:20,281 --> 00:24:26,001
by their talks, by their, I should say,

378
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:29,441
talks without understanding what they mean,

379
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:33,001
some sort of frivolous, sarcastic things.

380
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:37,121
And people get impressed by such people. And if you get impressed

381
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:39,841
then you should know you are not a Sahaja yogi.

382
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,681
A Sahaja yogi is to be known by his character,

383
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:48,161
by his righteousness, by his behavior.

384
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:50,521
The behavior of a Sahaja yogi should be

385
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:55,241
extremely a peaceful behavior, peaceful.

386
00:24:56,081 --> 00:25:01,001
Sahaja Yogis who are just rushing up and down, upset,

387
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,001
are not Sahaja Yogis.

388
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,841
Peaceful. Now how do you get your peace?

389
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,321
Peace comes from your Spirit.

390
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,641
Because you know you are in your Spirit.

391
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:14,921
You know that you are one with God Almighty.

392
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:16,881
What is there to hurry?

393
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:20,721
Where is He going and where are you going? You are together.

394
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,841
Whatever is there, you are there.

395
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,041
So what is there to hurry? What is there to just

396
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,761
hasten something or get upset?

397
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,241
Peaceful personality comes when you say, "No, not this."

398
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,921
When, when the haste start, then you should say,

399
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,921
"Not this, not this, not this."

400
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,441
Another could be that when you see somebody

401
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:46,281
whom you don't like or who has been harsh to you,

402
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:51,281
who has been cruel to you, you get annoyed.

403
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:53,881
And then again you will get disturbed.

404
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:58,441
At that time: "I forgive. I forgive. I forgive."

405
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:03,441
Main thing is, you have to be peaceful. Not that some people say

406
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:06,881
that "Mother, I try to forgive. It's difficult to forgive."

407
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:11,001
It's all mythical you know that very well. But what you have to say:

408
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:14,681
"I forgive. I forgive. I forgive," if there's disturbance.

409
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:20,081
Mine is another case. Supposing I see somebody who is a rakshasa,

410
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:24,801
then, you see, a kind of a thing builds in Me, which I don't know

411
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,921
what you should call in human words, but we can say

412
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:33,921
anti-forces against that person, like tremendous vibrations.

413
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:37,481
And when they are released, you see, they engulf that rakshasa.

414
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,081
He goes down in his own estimation, in the estimation of others.

415
00:26:41,281 --> 00:26:43,681
Somehow or other, he gets destroyed.

416
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:48,281
In a modern way, he is not killed but in a way he is killed.

417
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:51,641
So this is what happens but that may not be with you.

418
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:55,641
So, what you have to do when you start feeling anything

419
00:26:55,841 --> 00:27:00,561
anger against, say, some very devilish guru, supposing,

420
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:05,521
then you build it up in yourself and that built-up anger within you

421
00:27:05,721 --> 00:27:08,601
will neutralize that fellow. You need not say it out.

422
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,881
You need not talk about it, but that built-up anger

423
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:14,321
will little bit trouble you also because it has a little reaction.

424
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:17,561
but when it is released it will have an effect

425
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:22,681
and such a person cannot stand a Sahaja yogi.

426
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,721
You see, there are so many things that happen,

427
00:27:24,921 --> 00:27:26,961
automatically they'll happen.

428
00:27:27,161 --> 00:27:29,841
As you know that I had told people that

429
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,721
”Don't bring Rajneesh people to Me". But they wouldn't listen to Me.

430
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:38,241
They brought three people in a program. And three of them collapsed,

431
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:43,001
collapsed just like a big boulder,

432
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,121
and I didn't know what to do with them.

433
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:49,881
So they were really literally taken off

434
00:27:50,081 --> 00:27:52,841
as you would take out a big stone.

435
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:58,521
So, in that case I didn't get angry. I didn't do anything,

436
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:03,201
but as soon as they came the built-up force within Me

437
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:07,081
just froze them completely. I didn't do anything.

438
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,681
On the contrary, it was disturbing our program

439
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:14,081
but the built-up force could not wait; it just froze them.

440
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:16,961
So this is what is the other side of it,

441
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:21,401
that even if you hate any guru, you don't like him

442
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:24,121
because he has been so unkind, build up that force.

443
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:27,961
For that you need strength, because it's painful little bit.

444
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:31,761
Build up that strength within you, to hold that sword in your hand.

445
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,081
Then you get the sword and then you cut him off,

446
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:37,161
without doing anything. He is just cut off.

447
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:39,921
So going to that limit where we find

448
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:43,281
that some people are so sinful,

449
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:49,041
so horrid, so devilish that they should be punished, no doubt.

450
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:52,761
But for that you don't punish. Let the Divine do it.

451
00:28:52,961 --> 00:28:55,761
But your force built-in within yourself can do it.

452
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,841
You should try all these things within yourself

453
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,921
and see it works out.

454
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:03,641
Now, for meditating, many people think that,

455
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:08,761
four o'clock get up, do this, this that, and it's very difficult.

456
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:12,041
In the beginning. There's no need for you to get up

457
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:15,801
four o'clock otherwise, but in the beginning it is necessary.

458
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:18,001
Because - why I say, get up four o'clock -

459
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,401
you are such, such slaves to your sleep

460
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:23,801
because you sleep such a lot.

461
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:25,921
Early in the morning you sleep such a lot.

462
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:30,001
So just to overcome that habit of yours

463
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:34,161
of sleeping, of sloth, you should be able to get up anytime

464
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:37,121
that you have to get up because we are on war.

465
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,521
We are on war path. Which time is free for us?

466
00:29:40,721 --> 00:29:43,841
Anytime, whether I sleep or I am awake, I am fighting.

467
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:48,161
I don't find even a single minute that I am not working.

468
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:53,561
So this is what it is. You have to get up in the morning

469
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:57,921
because you have to train your body, "Better behave yourself."

470
00:29:58,641 --> 00:30:02,801
Supposing your body cannot sleep on the ground,

471
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,561
make your body sleep. Let's see what happens.

472
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:07,961
This is a tapasya. This is the penance

473
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:09,961
through which the Sahaja yogis have to go

474
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:13,481
that they make their body their slaves in the sense that

475
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,841
they can use that body. That doesn't mean tomorrow I want you

476
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:20,201
to be sitting on the bed of thorns

477
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,441
and I have to always take the extreme side to which you people go.

478
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:26,321
But if your body tries to be funny, better tell the body,

479
00:30:26,521 --> 00:30:29,521
"You behave yourself. What do you mean? Why can't you do this?

480
00:30:29,721 --> 00:30:32,161
Why can't you do that?"

481
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:35,361
There are so many habits we have, which we should avoid.

482
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:40,321
Some people have habits of coming forward too much all the time,

483
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:44,241
to be in the public to be there all the time, this, that.

484
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:48,001
Tell yourself, "There's no need." If you are called, you better go.

485
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:50,801
Detach yourself from yourself and see for yourself.

486
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:54,481
As I said, I see Myself sitting before Myself.

487
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:58,241
In the same way, you see yourself sitting before you

488
00:30:58,441 --> 00:30:59,961
and you tell yourself very clearly,

489
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:02,841
"Now, this is not the way it is to be done.

490
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:05,401
This is not the way. This is not Sahaja."

491
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,921
Why are you going forward all the time?

492
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:10,721
Why are you trying to show off?" Better rebuke yourself.

493
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:13,161
This is what I said, aggression to yourself.

494
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:16,881
And tell yourself that you have to be like a Sahaja yogi.

495
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:19,761
Sometimes I find people laugh at wrong times,

496
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,601
they cry at wrong times,

497
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:23,561
they do things at wrong times.

498
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:26,561
It's done, is done. Don't worry about that, but next time ...

499
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:29,601
Why did I do it? All right, next time I am not going to do this one.

500
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:32,281
This I did because I wanted to show off

501
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:36,281
or I was emotionally disturbed at the wrong time."

502
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:42,721
But the expression of love is very spontaneous.

503
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:45,881
But that spontaneity to come you must get rid of your habits.

504
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:48,721
Otherwise you can never become spontaneous.

505
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:51,921
A person who has got habits cannot.

506
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,641
The other day I was giving a lecture

507
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:56,201
and one fellow got up and went out

508
00:31:56,401 --> 00:32:00,841
while just meditating, because he wanted to smoke.

509
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,641
So you can imagine, because of habits how we sacrifice

510
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,881
something that is so important, something so auspicious.

511
00:32:10,201 --> 00:32:14,681
You can realize it that your habits within yourself are built-in

512
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:18,361
because there was no tradition of dharma also.

513
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:21,201
If there's a tradition of dharma, then what happens,

514
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,161
as I told the other day, explained to them,

515
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:31,841
that the fat cells in our stomach get the experiencer,

516
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:35,361
charmed, with the sense of virtue,

517
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:38,761
righteousness, of goodness, of innocence.

518
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,641
But if that is not so, it's like a dead ...

519
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,441
another cell going in the head

520
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:47,281
and experienced in dirty things, in doing dirty things,

521
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,401
in doing something that is destructive.

522
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,321
All these modern methods are destructive.

523
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:55,721
And then you get only the sensation from that

524
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:58,761
because it's a dead stuff, it needs a sensation all the time,

525
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:00,761
and they start doing all these things.

526
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,681
But now with the Kundalini awakening your dharma is built in.

527
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:09,481
Your cells are charmed by that.

528
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:14,721
So you use that power to enlighten your brain

529
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:19,601
which surrounds actually, as auras over the heart.

530
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:21,961
It's such a mutual understanding between the two

531
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:25,960
but you have to establish that mutual understanding.

532
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:31,641
Our idea is that

533
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:34,761
by God's grace we are so many,

534
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:37,321
and if we want, we can transform the world.

535
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:41,561
We can bring peace, joy and bliss to this world.

536
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:47,601
We could be blissful if we count our blessings.

537
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:54,761
And you'll be joyous if you get rid of your tags.

538
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,601
We'll have to fly, then only we can be joyous.

539
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:03,601
And for this we have to have our balance, our ascent

540
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:09,921
and then the desire to fly into the whole universe.

541
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:15,761
How to do it, you can find out yourself. It's not difficult.

542
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,241
How can I do it? Face yourself, find out about yourself.

543
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:22,361
Don't justify yourself. Don't be miserable.

544
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,441
Some people identify themselves with miseries

545
00:34:24,641 --> 00:34:26,161
and like to enjoy their miseries.

546
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:28,561
Stupid things these are, absolutely.

547
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:32,241
Such miserable looking people have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

548
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:38,241
So, you have to be joyous, happy, balanced, well-behaved, sober.

549
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,361
Outwardly it will show whatever is inward.

550
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:44,041
All your dignity will express, if there's dignity.

551
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:48,681
See if you just have a dignity outside, it will drop out in no time.

552
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:54,761
So all these things can be built from inside out, not outside in.

553
00:34:54,961 --> 00:35:01,081
And once they are built outside also, then they are best.

554
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:05,761
But outside, what we have to do is to put ourselves outside,

555
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,761
that's all. "Now Nirmala is sitting there. I am sitting here.

556
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:14,401
Now Nirmala tells Me, then I tell Nirmala.

557
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:17,681
"Let's work it out that way. And when we work it out,

558
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:21,761
then things will be very easy because now you have

559
00:35:21,961 --> 00:35:25,041
a state where you are separated from yourself.

560
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:27,401
So that is the state of Nirvikalpa

561
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:31,161
where you are not attached to anything.

562
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:34,401
You don't have any habits, you are not attached to anything,

563
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,361
you have no diseases, you have no troubles,

564
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:40,361
you are above everything. You do not try to

565
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:44,801
complicate things for Me. You do not try to say things more than Me.

566
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:48,721
You just take it a hint, sufficient, "Mother said so. All right."

567
00:35:48,921 --> 00:35:51,001
But some people have another bad habit,

568
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:53,441
"Mother said so. So this is so."

569
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:57,361
Use your discretion. How can Mother say? If She has said something,

570
00:35:57,561 --> 00:36:00,241
there must be something in it, must understand.

571
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:03,641
Like Warren asked Me, "Mother, should I marry?"

572
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:06,001
I was stunned, you know, I was stunned.

573
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:08,241
But I didn't know how to tell him or ...

574
00:36:08,441 --> 00:36:11,841
I said, "As long as you think you'll be happy, it's all right."

575
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,721
I mean any person, at that time who was not so mad,

576
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:18,481
could have seen the point, but that time he wouldn't understand.

577
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:21,161
In the same way, with everyone it happens

578
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:24,281
that when I tell you something, you don't understand.

579
00:36:24,761 --> 00:36:26,961
Most of the marriages have failed where you have said,

580
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:30,361
"I want to marry someone," ninety-nine point nine.

581
00:36:30,561 --> 00:36:33,441
When I have said you marry someone

582
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:36,321
because you have been living with that person, something,

583
00:36:36,521 --> 00:36:38,841
such marriages also have failed, I have seen.

584
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,961
But mostly the marriages we have chosen do not fail

585
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:45,001
because there's a divine hand. It's all planned out.

586
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,960
May God bless you all.
