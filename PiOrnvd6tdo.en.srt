1
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:03,479
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

2
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,673
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

3
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:22,018
for different, different purposes.

4
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:35,139
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

5
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,680
who were worshipping the Mother,

6
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:49,103
they found out that what
She has done for us.

7
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:53,705
The other day I told you
the dharma

8
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:01,275
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

9
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:08,154
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

10
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:13,178
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

11
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:20,514
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

12
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:29,555
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

13
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,304
though we are not aware of it.

14
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:39,197
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

15
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:44,380
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

16
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:51,828
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

17
00:08:54,227 --> 00:09:00,717
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

18
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:10,281
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

19
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:20,567
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

20
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:28,381
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

21
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:35,219
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

22
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:40,090
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

23
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:44,867
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

24
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:52,162
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

25
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:56,511
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

26
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:02,467
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

27
00:10:02,492 --> 00:10:12,535
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

28
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,684
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

29
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:23,961
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

30
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:30,628
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

31
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:34,638
So, the second one She says is:

32
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:41,650
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

33
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:46,064
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

34
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:53,934
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

35
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,164
 But, it’s not there.

36
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:04,220
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

37
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:10,991
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

38
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,642
and some present to another one.

39
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:19,354
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

40
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:25,239
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

41
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:34,081
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

42
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:37,841
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

43
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:43,175
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

44
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,158
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

45
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:52,735
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

46
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,396
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

47
00:11:57,421 --> 00:12:02,445
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

48
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:11,744
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

49
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:16,326
These so close to each other.

50
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:24,077
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

51
00:12:24,102 --> 00:12:28,547
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

52
00:12:28,572 --> 00:12:32,416
if You can go to that country”.

53
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:35,736
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

54
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:41,666
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

55
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:51,828
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

56
00:12:51,853 --> 00:13:00,823
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

57
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,983
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

58
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:12,503
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

59
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:20,083
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

60
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:24,612
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

61
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,789
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

62
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:35,132
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

63
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:40,883
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

64
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:44,050
Then you must compete with others.

65
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:50,521
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

66
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:58,725
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

67
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:07,179
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

68
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:13,005
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

69
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,512
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

70
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:23,071
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

71
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,927
Forgiveness from the heart.

72
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:32,291
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

73
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:35,273
has exploited you, has troubled you,

74
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:41,150
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

75
00:14:41,175 --> 00:14:46,803
Do we use that power to forgive?

76
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:58,235
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

77
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,451
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

78
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:08,451
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

79
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:14,893
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

80
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:19,103
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

81
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:23,978
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

82
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:29,924
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

83
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,971
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

84
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:37,997
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

85
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:42,475
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

86
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:50,488
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

87
00:15:50,513 --> 00:15:55,765
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

88
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,869
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

89
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:06,823
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

90
00:16:06,848 --> 00:16:13,502
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

91
00:16:13,526 --> 00:16:21,215
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

92
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,605
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

93
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,086
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

94
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,387
But when your ego is working or...

95
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:35,951
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

96
00:16:35,976 --> 00:16:41,240
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

97
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:50,484
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

98
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:58,262
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

99
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:02,037
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

100
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,750
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

101
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:11,592
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

102
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:16,093
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

103
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,393
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

104
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:26,262
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

105
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:32,156
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

106
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:36,279
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

107
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:39,851
So, Mother has to tell you.

108
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:53,960
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

109
00:17:53,985 --> 00:18:00,348
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

110
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:04,168
She puts you into delusion,

111
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:08,910
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

112
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:15,291
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

113
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:20,919
She allows, allows you to go wrong

114
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:25,640
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

115
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:28,901
Very important it is that She plays,

116
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:32,653
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

117
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:36,844
And this is discussed
in every religion

118
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:41,713
that we get lost with this delusion.

119
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:46,317
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

120
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:50,247
We have the delusions
of ego.

121
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:55,525
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

122
00:18:55,550 --> 00:19:02,100
 that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

123
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,515
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

124
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,381
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

125
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:19,899
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

126
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:25,046
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

127
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:30,132
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

128
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:35,396
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

129
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:39,788
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

130
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:46,863
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

131
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,951
then only you can return back.

132
00:19:49,976 --> 00:19:54,285
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

133
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:05,569
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

134
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:10,334
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

135
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:16,920
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

136
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:22,955
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

137
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,278
It is beyond the mind.

138
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:33,311
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

139
00:20:33,687 --> 00:20:40,963
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

140
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:47,917
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

141
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:52,390
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

142
00:20:52,415 --> 00:20:56,448
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

143
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:59,917
and this connection should not
be broken,

144
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:05,030
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

145
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,706
All this is within us,

146
00:21:09,344 --> 00:21:15,052
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

147
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:21,938
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

148
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:27,031
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

149
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:34,764
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

150
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:40,684
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

151
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:47,372
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:21:47,397 --> 00:21:51,834
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

153
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:59,592
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

154
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:05,117
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

155
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:07,251
For example, it is also said that,

156
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:14,188
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

157
00:22:15,005 --> 00:22:20,624
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

158
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:29,700
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

159
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:37,664
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

160
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:42,267
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

161
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:47,459
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

162
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,676
Lajja rupena samsthita:

163
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:57,868
means you have to have shame
of your body.

164
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:02,535
That’s specially for women.

165
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:11,191
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

166
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:14,272
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

167
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:17,235
That shyness gradually disappears,

168
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,735
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

169
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,195
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

170
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,346
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

171
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:34,325
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

172
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,564
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

173
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:44,445
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

174
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,541
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

175
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:54,575
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

176
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,481
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

177
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:03,581
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

178
00:24:03,606 --> 00:24:06,915
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

179
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,599
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

180
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:17,484
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

181
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:24,661
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

182
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:33,391
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

183
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:40,811
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

184
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:45,628
There is no space for any artist

185
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:55,280
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

186
00:24:55,305 --> 00:25:02,345
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

187
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,554
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

188
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:14,222
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

189
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:19,870
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

190
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:23,521
then it is His art,

191
00:25:23,546 --> 00:25:31,211
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

192
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:36,188
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

193
00:25:36,213 --> 00:25:40,447
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

194
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:44,056
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

195
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:47,750
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

196
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:54,001
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

197
00:25:54,517 --> 00:26:00,299
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

198
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:04,397
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

199
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:09,614
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

200
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:13,306
and we start behaving in their
manner,

201
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:16,357
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

202
00:26:16,382 --> 00:26:21,740
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

203
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:26,335
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

204
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,487
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

205
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:33,276
they would never have accepted
them.

206
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:36,358
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

207
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:39,728
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

208
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:45,321
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

209
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:52,132
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

210
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:57,023
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

211
00:26:57,048 --> 00:27:01,471
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

212
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:08,043
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

213
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:11,697
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

214
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:16,839
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

215
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,091
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

216
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:26,005
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

217
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,090
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

218
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,566
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

219
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:41,632
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

220
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:45,544
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

221
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:49,642
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

222
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:56,197
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

223
00:27:56,223 --> 00:28:01,626
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

224
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:09,346
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

225
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:12,549
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

226
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:16,153
or to worship the idols or anything,

227
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:24,608
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

228
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:30,318
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

229
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:37,554
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

230
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:41,721
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

231
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:44,756
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

232
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:51,542
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

233
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:57,535
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

234
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,936
and this and that, and give
justification.

235
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:06,519
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

236
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,744
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

237
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:13,197
and who are misbehaving.

238
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:19,031
You must do what a saint should do.

239
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:23,682
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

240
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:28,568
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

241
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:34,999
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

242
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:39,116
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

243
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:42,759
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

244
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:48,079
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

245
00:29:48,104 --> 00:29:52,540
You can change the things
that you are eating,

246
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:58,165
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

247
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:05,775
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

248
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,896
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

249
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:15,789
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

250
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:20,154
But all the time worried about
their body.

251
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:26,830
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

252
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:35,260
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

253
00:30:36,122 --> 00:30:40,197
Fashion is madness.

254
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:47,739
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

255
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,467
But in India also fashion started.

256
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:54,935
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

257
00:30:54,961 --> 00:31:01,566
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

258
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:05,844
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

259
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,074
You have a particular design,

260
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,081
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

261
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:15,778
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

262
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:20,747
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

263
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:27,096
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

264
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:34,068
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

265
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:39,093
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

266
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:43,607
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

267
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:48,699
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

268
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:53,850
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

269
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:59,144
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

270
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:05,793
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

271
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:09,465
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

272
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,323
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

273
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:18,154
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

274
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:24,784
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

275
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:28,165
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

276
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,783
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

277
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:37,664
- you have to exercise and meditate.

278
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:42,237
If you meditate you become peaceful.

279
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:47,741
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

280
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:56,149
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

281
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:59,562
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

282
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:04,171
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

283
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:10,024
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

284
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:17,054
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

285
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:22,356
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

286
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:29,993
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

287
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:34,747
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

288
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:39,533
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

289
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:43,101
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

290
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:45,853
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

291
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:50,280
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

292
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:54,176
The joy of that artist is finished.

293
00:33:54,201 --> 00:34:00,197
You cannot get that joy,

294
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:09,280
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

295
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:14,516
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

296
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:20,394
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

297
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:23,666
and it makes the life so miserable.

298
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:28,389
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

299
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:34,202
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

300
00:34:34,227 --> 00:34:39,450
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

301
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:43,326
problems of sometimes snowing.

302
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,602
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

303
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:50,028
and it’s very well done, we got it.

304
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:55,968
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

305
00:34:55,993 --> 00:35:02,629
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

306
00:35:02,654 --> 00:35:07,912
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

307
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:12,498
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

308
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:18,772
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

309
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:22,473
of these Italians, so-called.

310
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:26,944
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

311
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:31,583
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

312
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:36,376
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

313
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:40,888
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

314
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:47,980
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

315
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:51,796
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

316
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:57,206
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

317
00:35:57,231 --> 00:36:00,838
With a simple thing like that.

318
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:07,797
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

319
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:11,008
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

320
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:13,914
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

321
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:17,239
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

322
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:22,315
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

323
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:27,216
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

324
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:31,754
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

325
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:37,066
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

326
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:42,917
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

327
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:50,638
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

328
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:58,551
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

329
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:03,905
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

330
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:10,214
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

331
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:17,086
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

332
00:37:23,337 --> 00:37:33,322
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

333
00:37:33,347 --> 00:37:41,052
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

334
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:45,017
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

335
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:48,621
What is the need to think?”.

336
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:55,979
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

337
00:37:56,004 --> 00:38:00,227
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

338
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:04,176
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

339
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:09,535
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

340
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,575
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

341
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:25,054
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

342
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,907
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

343
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:34,554
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

344
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,239
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

345
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:42,745
What is the need to go to Mars?

346
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:47,212
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

347
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,931
First they came to India, then went
to China,

348
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:56,176
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

349
00:38:56,201 --> 00:39:00,323
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

350
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:04,907
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

351
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:09,955
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

352
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:13,822
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

353
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:17,231
then they’ll jump in.

354
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:22,492
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

355
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:26,561
Because monkeys won’t do that.

356
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:33,576
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

357
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:38,792
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

358
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:44,072
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

359
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:49,054
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

360
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,358
They have no time!

361
00:39:51,383 --> 00:39:55,623
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

362
00:39:55,648 --> 00:40:00,798
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

363
00:40:00,823 --> 00:40:04,957
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

364
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:08,448
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

365
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:11,895
For meditation they have no time.

366
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:19,878
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

367
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:27,409
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

368
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:34,618
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

369
00:40:35,629 --> 00:40:41,434
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

370
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:48,590
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

371
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:53,694
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

372
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:58,133
 But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

373
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:02,427
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

374
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,696
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

375
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:10,679
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

376
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:14,847
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

377
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,996
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

378
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:21,010
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

379
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:25,000
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

380
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:33,056
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

381
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,072
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

382
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:43,687
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

383
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:49,633
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

384
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:55,347
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

385
00:41:55,372 --> 00:42:03,164
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

386
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:12,507
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

387
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:20,189
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

388
00:42:20,214 --> 00:42:22,698
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

389
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:29,517
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

390
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:33,633
So they also wanted to see.

391
00:42:33,658 --> 00:42:42,242
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

392
00:42:44,116 --> 00:42:50,169
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

393
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,790
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

394
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:59,499
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

395
00:42:59,524 --> 00:43:02,022
Did you follow this point?

396
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:09,902
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

397
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:15,342
where you are yourself that.

398
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:20,338
So, how can you see yourself?

399
00:43:20,363 --> 00:43:24,592
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

400
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:28,517
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

401
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:34,729
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

402
00:43:34,754 --> 00:43:39,945
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

403
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:44,139
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

404
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:52,174
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

405
00:43:52,454 --> 00:43:57,810
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

406
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:04,893
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

407
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:11,689
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

408
00:44:11,714 --> 00:44:19,885
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

409
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:29,043
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

410
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:36,372
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

411
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:42,227
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

412
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:49,282
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

413
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:55,662
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

414
00:44:55,687 --> 00:45:00,485
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

415
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:06,547
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

416
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:10,662
Whatever I may try on My own

417
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:15,301
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

418
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:22,827
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

419
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:35,232
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

420
00:45:35,257 --> 00:45:39,330
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

421
00:45:39,355 --> 00:45:44,244
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

422
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:50,702
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

423
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:58,768
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

424
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:03,083
You use them.

425
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:07,086
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

426
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:13,137
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

427
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:20,075
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

428
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,260
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

429
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:33,779
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

430
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:40,649
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

431
00:46:41,213 --> 00:46:45,351
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

432
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:52,736
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

433
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:58,702
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

434
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:06,205
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

435
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:12,171
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

436
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:21,044
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

437
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:29,349
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

438
00:47:29,374 --> 00:47:32,016
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

439
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:35,622
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

440
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:40,991
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

441
00:47:41,016 --> 00:47:46,736
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

442
00:47:46,761 --> 00:47:52,010
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

443
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,765
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

444
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,154
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

445
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:03,746
He started looking at me
like this.’”

446
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:06,539
So, with the Kundalini awakening

447
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:12,253
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

448
00:48:12,278 --> 00:48:17,745
And then your generosity,

449
00:48:19,392 --> 00:48:25,914
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

450
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:32,788
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

451
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:42,555
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

452
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,687
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

453
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:50,134
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

454
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:57,878
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

455
00:48:57,903 --> 00:49:02,482
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

456
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:12,318
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

457
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:16,559
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

458
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:26,481
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

459
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:32,727
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

460
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:38,438
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

461
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:43,311
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

462
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:49,278
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

463
00:49:49,303 --> 00:49:55,859
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

464
00:49:55,884 --> 00:49:58,426
They are just within you,

465
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:04,996
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

466
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:10,111
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

467
00:50:10,136 --> 00:50:17,275
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

468
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,886
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

469
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:25,753
May God bless you all.
