1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:19,349
Last night was a night of complete darkness, 
that they call it as amavasya; and just now

2
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:24,830
only the first phase of the moon has started.

3
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:39,890
Today we are here to celebrate the day when 
the Sahastrara was opened out.

4
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,969
Also you have seen in the photograph.

5
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:53,770
It was actually a photograph of my brain, 
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened

6
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,820
out.

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,800
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,339
It’s something great these modern times 
have done.

9
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,270
So the modern times have brought a lot of 
things which can prove the existence of the

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,260
Divine.

11
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,820
Also it can prove about me.

12
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,420
It can convince you what I am.

13
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:36,790
This is very important because, in the modern 
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

14
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,120
to be fully recognised.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,630
This is one of the conditions for all the 
Sahaja Yogis.

16
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:53,680
Now let’s see what’s happening in the 
modern times, in the brains of the people.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:03,790
In the brains of the people today, if you 
see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

18
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:11,430
There has been an attack since long but in 
the modern times it’s the worst time.

19
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:25,680
They are trying to make the limbic area very 
insensitive.

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:44,200
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts 
and very depressive music, you can say, like

21
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,310
Greek tragedy nonsense.

22
00:02:46,310 --> 00:03:05,349
All these things came from the medieval period 
till, we should say, this new age has started.

23
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,220
That one itself was no good for our limbic 
area.

24
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,489
That made us very depressive.

25
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:26,780
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called 
miseries.

26
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:41,310
But then came this modern age in which people 
became overactive – over-activity started.

27
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:49,670
With that the brain also became overactive.

28
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:59,230
In addition to the dullness before, it’s 
gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

29
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:10,189
So to dull it again they took to drugs, they 
took to very horrible music.

30
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:18,250
That’s how they made this limbic area very, 
very insensitive.

31
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:30,840
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin 
with was to be taken in greater quantity and

32
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:40,139
later on they had to take the drugs which 
were of a much more severe nature.

33
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,740
It went on like that and now we know that 
this drug is the only way people think they

34
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,900
can survive.

35
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,639
Why?

36
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,879
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

37
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,020
In the modern times we have something called 
‘tensions’.

38
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,590
It was never there before.

39
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,870
People never talked of their tensions.

40
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,910
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!”

41
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,110
“You give me a tension!”

42
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,670
What is this tension?

43
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,130
It’s because of my advent.

44
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:23,669
The limbic area wants to know about me.

45
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:33,151
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is 
increasing, is trying to rise in people; because

46
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:35,389
you become the channels.

47
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:49,160
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations, 
and these vibrations give a challenge to the

48
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,169
Kundalini, or a message, and in various people 
it rises.

49
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:02,389
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it 
may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls

50
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,169
back, because there’s no recognition.

51
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:13,139
So every time they do something, this Kundalini 
comes up and gives them a pressure, because

52
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:18,879
their Sahastrara is not open.

53
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,319
It’s a closed door.

54
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,729
Because of the closed door this gives them 
a kind of a pressure in the head, which they

55
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:31,400
don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

56
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:39,050
Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it 
out, itself, but it cannot.

57
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:47,689
And those also who get their Realisation, 
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

58
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,199
they go on getting into tensions.

59
00:06:51,199 --> 00:07:06,349
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out 
so many years back, still we have some things

60
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:12,180
to be done – is to clear out our Sahastrara, 
first of all.

61
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:23,770
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara, 
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

62
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:41,530
opened out, then we started feeling the grace, 
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

63
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,889
grace not the Kundalini.

64
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:55,439
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round, 
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

65
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:04,669
our chakras opened more, and more threads 
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

66
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:11,790
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s 
important that you must meditate.

67
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:18,849
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras 
will be alright because, as you know, that

68
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:26,610
the peethas, or the controlling centres of 
all these chakras, are in the brain around

69
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,530
the limbic area.

70
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:39,450
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything 
works out in a very different way.

71
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,190
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the 
big problem [which] always people ask me.

72
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,740
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

73
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:56,310
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand 
petals.

74
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,389
That’s why I could break it also.

75
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:05,950
As I am today, as you see me.

76
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,720
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya” 
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

77
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:20,839
So this is the illusion which is all the time 
there for you, which is very elusive.

78
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:28,329
It had to be that way because you could not 
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

79
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:39,910
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday 
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

80
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:43,080
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown 
outside.

81
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,250
Please don’t take photographs when I’m 
speaking, alright?

82
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,250
You can take later on.

83
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,250
There’s no hurry about.

84
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,720
Just pay attention to My lecture.

85
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
Please, pay attention.

86
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
It’s important.

87
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,580
It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody 
should take photographs during puja because

88
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,190
it is a very intense thing [that] one has 
to work it out.

89
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,290
Please, pay attention.

90
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,470
Even if you don’t understand, it has effect 
on you.

91
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:24,250
So I would request you to pay full attention 
to me when I am talking.

92
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,450
It works better.

93
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,339
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after 
by you.

94
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,810
It’s the temple of your Mother.

95
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:44,570
When you say you put me in the heart, actually 
you put me in the Sahastrara.

96
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,899
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here 
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

97
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:57,730
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha, 
the centre, which controls the heart, which

98
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:07,880
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say 
of Shiva.

99
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,120
So when you put me in the heart actually you 
put me there.

100
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,839
So to raise it from heart to there, or to 
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

101
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:28,230
of two types of people.

102
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:37,089
Some people who are sensitive in their heart 
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

103
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,791
are very sensitive on their heart – the 
first thing they do as soon as they see me

104
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:48,560
they put their hands to their heart.

105
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:57,320
And that is what it is, that, if you try to 
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

106
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,220
much easier.

107
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,380
To feel me in your heart.

108
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:14,079
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

109
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:21,090
You have to love me as I love you.

110
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:29,920
You have to love each one of yourselves, because 
you are all within me.

111
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,709
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

112
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:37,079
Love is within.

113
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:45,360
And love manifests if, just, you open your 
heart.

114
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,029
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

115
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,220
Firstly, the conditioning.

116
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:02,769
In the West to express your love is regarded 
as sinful actually.

117
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:08,610
It takes them time to say, “I love you,” 
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

118
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,480
on saying, “I hate you!

119
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,600
I hate you!

120
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,730
I hate you!”

121
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,680
But to hate someone is sinful.

122
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,889
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

123
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:20,889
So to say that, “I hate you!

124
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:28,980
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

125
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:40,589
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on 
saying, “I love you."

126
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:49,520
After all, you must love a person who is so 
dear to you.

127
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:58,880
Anyone who has done something good for you, 
you love that person.

128
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,160
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you 
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

129
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,230
to love.

130
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:20,480
And if She says that, “They are all within 
my body,” so it should be even easier to

131
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,370
love each other.

132
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:36,670
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is 
done through this love, this love which is

133
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:49,990
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which 
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

134
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,300
any return – nirvaaj.

135
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,699
But the conditionings are too much.

136
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:08,019
First the problem of conditioning comes to 
you when you think that, “This condition

137
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:19,690
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot 
love someone because this is the condition!”

138
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:30,730
But actually the conditioning itself is so 
absurd, if you see it one by one.

139
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:42,180
To make it simple, I would like you to understand 
the conditioning part where I read once an

140
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,399
article, an interesting one, “Who killed 
the romance?”

141
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,120
So he said “the hairdressers”.

142
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,529
I was wondering how is he connecting romance 
with the hairdressers?

143
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:05,110
Because people used to go to a hairdresser 
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

144
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,180
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

145
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:17,399
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore 
another type of hairdressing, because everyday

146
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:25,700
new things are coming, then immediately the 
husband would say, “Oh I hate you because

147
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,900
of your hairdressing!”

148
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,230
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s 
why he loves.

149
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,650
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you 
hate it!

150
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,480
“I don’t like it!”

151
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:47,100
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I 
like it”, itself, is a sign that the conditioning

152
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,720
is too much.

153
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,370
You make a proper hair dress and you dress 
up properly and you come out and then suddenly

154
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,220
people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

155
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,480
Who are you?

156
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,449
What right we have got to say that to anyone?

157
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:14,790
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

158
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:24,000
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say 
“I hate it”?

159
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,980
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright, 
I like this but you could do better."

160
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:38,520
That’s the sign of love when you want a 
person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

161
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:47,840
But this is on a very, very baser level that 
we see people.

162
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:58,539
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent 
he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he

163
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:07,510
is, how charming – that’s another word 
which is very elusive.

164
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,030
These are also kind of conditionings of the 
mind that you think that a particular style

165
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:23,179
of a person is a loveable person, that you 
love that person.

166
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:26,970
It’s so much outside.

167
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,809
Or some people actually do not love but show 
they love because somebody has more money.

168
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:37,340
And the money, he’s not going to part with, 
no doubt, but you love that person because

169
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:46,390
he has more money, or he has a better car 
or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

170
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:55,770
So this kind of an idea one has also is a 
killer of love.

171
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:02,429
If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot 
have joy without love.

172
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:11,150
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

173
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,559
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and 
subtler.

174
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:22,710
Then we start loving our own children, that’s 
very common.

175
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,929
I mean, of course, also some people don’t 
even love their children, I mean there are

176
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,149
all kinds, you see.

177
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:36,890
But then they go on, “This is my child, 
this is my child, this is my child!”

178
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:48,140
That again is the death of love.

179
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:54,559
As I told you before: the sap of the tree 
rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every

180
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,850
leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

181
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,320
It’s not attached.

182
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:08,540
If you are attached to one part or to one 
flower because it is more beautiful then the

183
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,360
tree will die and the flower will also die.

184
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,679
So that’s the death of the love.

185
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:26,580
So you have to have love which doesn’t get 
entangled or attached.

186
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,100
Every time I tell like this they say, “How 
to do it?”

187
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,659
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

188
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:42,409
Love of conditioned mind is different.

189
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:51,740
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way 
because it is conditioned.

190
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:02,000
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within 
us, which is like a balloon on top of our

191
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
head.

192
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,429
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

193
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:17,240
The conditioning of course, like they see 
a carpet.

194
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,830
Now it is, according to their conditioning, 
is not good.

195
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,170
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!”

196
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,170
Or something.

197
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:32,840
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

198
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,510
And the higher level at the most, is that 
you love your own country, so “My country

199
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,510
is the best!”

200
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:45,789
Whether it is killing people, whether it is 
destroying the world peace, it’s all right

201
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,500
because “I belong to a particular country 
which is the best!”

202
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,080
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

203
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,580
It goes on subtler and subtler.

204
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,140
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

205
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:09,690
Because intelligently if you have understood 
that something is good then nobody can save

206
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,600
you!

207
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,370
Because through your brain you have understood.

208
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:24,380
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading 
the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and

209
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:35,190
an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface 
to that, an introduction, and he said that

210
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,570
the creativity is killed in the West.

211
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:46,750
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian 
critic.

212
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,560
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

213
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,460
You don’t have people who are critics?”

214
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,590
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So 
what do they criticise?”

215
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:07,799
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time 
there was no rain so we had problems and things."

216
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,809
He said: “No, no, no, no!

217
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:16,210
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise 
the poet, do they criticise an artist?”

218
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,410
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

219
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,880
“It is created, whatever he felt is created.

220
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,260
But supposing he has put something very vulgar 
then of course we don’t like it.

221
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,360
But if it is created by a beautiful mind, 
it has to be beautiful."

222
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,600
“Then you don’t criticise?”

223
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,659
He says, “No, because we cannot create like 
that.

224
00:23:44,659 --> 00:23:53,230
So what business have you got to criticise?”

225
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,870
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we 
have done: we have norms about everything,

226
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,100
about art about every creation.

227
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,870
We don’t like this carpet.

228
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,870
Why?

229
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:11,490
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual 
understanding of the norms we have reached

230
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,720
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we 
don’t like it.

231
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,790
Can you even create one inch of that?

232
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,700
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

233
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,740
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार 
चेष्टा).

234
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
Un-authorised.

235
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,010
You have no authority to criticise.

236
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:44,440
You can’t do anything, so why should you 
criticise?

237
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,360
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself 
that you are not in authority, you are not

238
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,659
worthy of it, to criticise.

239
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:00,480
If you are not worthy of it why should you 
criticise anything?

240
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:09,899
And, otherwise also, you must know [that] 
you are a slave of your ego.

241
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:15,820
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence, 
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

242
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,679
a point, to have some norm.

243
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,549
And then it becomes a collective ego of a 
particular community, of a particular country,

244
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:25,720
of a particular ideology.

245
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,100
It’s collective.

246
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:36,549
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no 
art!”

247
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:44,409
That is the reason we cannot have masters 
any more in art.

248
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,169
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

249
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:52,240
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered 
a lot.

250
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,809
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

251
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:56,930
All these artists suffered a lot.

252
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,669
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

253
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:06,260
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily, 
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

254
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,789
So I think people have given up.

255
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:12,600
I met an artist who had done lots of art work 
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

256
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,860
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

257
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
It’s created for myself."

258
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,450
I said, “I would like to see!”

259
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:23,480
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I 
said, “Why don’t you show?”

260
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
He said, “No use.

261
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
People will just criticise.

262
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,210
I do it for my own pleasure.

263
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:36,919
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

264
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,640
So one of the basic things we should avoid 
is to criticise others.

265
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,490
Better to criticise yourself.

266
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:53,779
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers 
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

267
00:26:53,779 --> 00:27:01,220
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself, 
is the best way.

268
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:09,800
If you know how to laugh at yourself then 
you will not object or will not stand in the

269
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,289
way of any creativity of another person.

270
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:18,000
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

271
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,809
You can criticise anything.

272
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:25,000
You think you have a right.

273
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,390
Who has given you this right to criticise?

274
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,960
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

275
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,480
How can we criticise anyone?

276
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:47,720
As saints, as you are now, of course, you 
can make out who is caught up, who has given

277
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,590
bad vibrations, who has the problem.

278
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,260
You know that.

279
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,930
You know it.

280
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,600
It’s not conditioning.

281
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,080
It’s not just you are doing because there’s 
some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

282
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,049
It’s an actual feeling within you.

283
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:10,700
It’s the bodha (बोध: knowledge), by 
which you know.

284
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,650
Then what should you do?

285
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,440
In your love, you have to tell the person, 
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you.

286
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,789
Better be corrected!”

287
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:24,059
But in a way that he does it.

288
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,809
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way 
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

289
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,640
you have not loved that person at all.

290
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,320
Allow everybody to grow.

291
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:47,549
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are 
very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

292
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:52,059
But also there are some people whom we can 
call as very difficult; very!

293
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:59,700
There’s sort of a crack in their head or 
something, that part is missing sometimes.

294
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,309
Some screws are loose I think.

295
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,360
Sometimes they behave like clowns.

296
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,440
And we have known some people.

297
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,409
We just can’t help them.

298
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:15,909
They could be very intelligent otherwise, 
they could be very sharp otherwise, but in

299
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:27,840
Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that 
level where you can say: now the growth is

300
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,260
possible.

301
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,149
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like 
the Sun, there would have been no growth.

302
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:41,400
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would 
have been no growth.

303
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:50,309
It had to come to the centre where it had 
both the things in proper proportions to grow.

304
00:29:50,309 --> 00:30:01,549
In the same way, a human being has to work 
out that you keep a moderation and a balance,

305
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:09,740
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

306
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:16,470
That balance you learn when you love someone.

307
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:23,260
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask 
some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

308
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:33,809
This is out of love for them, because once 
they go out, they improve, I have seen, they

309
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:38,039
tremendously improve.

310
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:46,140
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community 
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

311
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,750
more nuisance because their ego plays the 
part, maybe the conditioning plays the part,

312
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,419
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

313
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:58,059
So we have to ask them that, “Please now, 
depart for a while."

314
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:04,039
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person 
then he has to be straightforward.

315
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:16,790
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically 
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that

316
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:22,809
person, that this is the reason why we want 
you to be out.

317
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:28,650
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome, 
I know that.

318
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:36,960
But you have to show complete patience and 
complete understanding and you must talk like

319
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,559
a person who loves.

320
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:51,850
Love has such a power that nobody wants to 
do something that will suggest that they don’t

321
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,470
love; very powerful thing it is.

322
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:01,700
It binds people in such a beautiful manner 
that one wants to do something: for example

323
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,519
you want to give me flowers, because you know 
I love flowers.

324
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,660
So you want to give me flower to suggest that, 
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

325
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:17,269
I know you love me but you just want to, sort 
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

326
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:23,940
So you want to give me a flower to show your 
love and expression of your inner feeling

327
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,679
for me.

328
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,519
So all these material things can be used to 
express your love.

329
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:39,990
They can be very easily expressed in such 
a manner that another person knows what is

330
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,990
love.

331
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,480
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

332
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:59,350
So, if you see that, this brain has to love; 
brain has to love.

333
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:07,840
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga, 
through your brain and intelligence, if you

334
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,419
reach a point where you understand that: No, 
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

335
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,130
all these things.

336
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,510
It’s just love.

337
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,350
It’s simple love.

338
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:25,980
So the same Sahastrara which has been used 
before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

339
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,510
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things, 
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

340
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:39,039
And there is the culmination where the brain 
just loves.

341
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,380
That is the situation one has to reach.

342
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,809
It just loves.

343
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,919
It knows only love because it has seen the 
power of love.

344
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,500
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and 
then you see the point.

345
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,010
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like 
Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those

346
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,880
treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No, 
nothing!”

347
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:10,490
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

348
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:16,220
So once you reach that point, we can say now 
you are in nirvikalpa because there is no

349
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,130
vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because 
you love.

350
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,680
In love you don’t doubt, no question.

351
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,400
Only when you think you doubt.

352
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:30,100
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just 
love, because you enjoy love.

353
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,810
And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

354
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:40,620
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been 
opened out.

355
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:48,340
We have to open out our Sahastrara again: 
through our meditative processes, through

356
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,150
understanding ourselves and others.

357
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:56,150
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s 
no way out now.

358
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,900
We have reached to the end of it now.

359
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,820
The whole logic has ended up now.

360
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,930
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

361
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,380
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s 
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

362
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:19,770
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of 
it.

363
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:32,000
That is what one has to learn by reasoning 
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

364
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,620
May God bless you all.
