1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,560
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,640
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,240
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,320
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,960
But if you have too much outward type, you're running a madness.

6
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,640
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,640
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,160
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,080
You can read it in the night,

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,880
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,720
you'll get upset.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,720
And poor this spleen has to pour in more red blood corpuscles

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,080
and it becomes mad and fails you.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,640
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,800
talk to your children, look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,160
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Then you have your food properly.

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,720
Sit down and eat properly.

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,800
But no, just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,640
you jump into your car,

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,640
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,480
honking at people, getting angry with them,

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,720
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

24
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,960
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,160
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
if not with heart attack.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,960
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,960
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,240
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

30
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,080
while the sister

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:14,000
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
Nanaki.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Now this aspect of life we never think about.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,400
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,080
And if you are rich, you will see to it that I cure that person.

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,880
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,640
You'll be in ten times on My head

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
unless and until I cure your leukemia.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,400
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,960
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
What have you gained out of all this running about?

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,160
Nothing. But this horrible left Nabhi

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,400
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,080
Only person who has gained is the doctor

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,640
or the doctors or the hospitals.”

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
They won't listen.

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,160
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,080
that one can pass out within one month,

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,480
doctors will tell you,

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,880
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,560
They'll take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,480
But why have that?

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,880
Be patient with yourself.

54
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,560
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

56
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,720
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,080
All these great gurus came on this earth

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,320
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,320
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

60
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,800
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,640
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,960
for you people to understand

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,320
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,880
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,960
because if they are vegetarians they can’t bear to see

66
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,800
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,800
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

68
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,880
But drinking does.

69
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,880
Drinking does go against your awareness.

70
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,720
But not eating meat or not eating meat.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,000
But one has to understand.

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,320
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,400
those who eat meat are Tamo Gunis.

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,320
I am surprised at Gita itself.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,800
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,400
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,320
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

79
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,400
because I have already killed.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,800
Nothing is going to be killed by you

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,160
because they are already killed.

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,560
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,080
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

84
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,480
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

85
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,320
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,640
Now this seems to be a new introduction

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,880
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,080
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,320
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

90
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,880
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates,

91
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
we have seen it in Sahaja Yoga.

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,800
We have two types of diseases,

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,240
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

94
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:57,800
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,320
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,400
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

97
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,400
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

98
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,640
And then the doctor says Gita is all humbug

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,880
because it doesn't understand what it is saying.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,560
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,880
I think somebody has gone wrong there

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
and has written something wrong in Gita

103
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,880
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

104
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,400
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,960
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

107
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,720
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

108
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,640
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

109
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,320
become very aggressive

110
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,240
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,720
But the people who just eat grass can become

112
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,720
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,320
They will have lethargic heart, not active heart,

114
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,480
they will also get heart attack.

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,160
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

116
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,720
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

117
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
they'll never be able to digest any food,

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
they'll be very weak people.

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,480
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

120
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,480
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

121
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,720
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

122
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,240
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,240
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

124
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
But those who are active people should take

125
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

126
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,160
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

127
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,800
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

128
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,640
Was He worse than them by any chance?

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

131
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,080
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

132
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,560
Only thing you should not eat the meat

133
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,560
of animals which are bigger than you,

134
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,560
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,240
Specially Indian cow.

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
Also bigger cows are not good

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,400
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

138
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,880
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,720
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

140
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,400
and you must save other animals,

141
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,000
but they never said you must save goats

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
and you must save chickens.

143
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,960
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

144
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,640
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

145
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,400
and also bugs?

146
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,240
Of course they are doing like that.

147
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,640
Some Jain people save bugs and

148
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,400
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

149
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,880
human beings and they are paid for it.

150
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,640
It's absurd but they do it.

151
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,880
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

152
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,560
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

153
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,320
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

154
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,560
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

155
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,880
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,240
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

157
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,960
So there is no good in you people

158
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,880
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

159
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Of course in the Western countries people should take

160
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,800
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

161
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,160
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

162
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

163
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
they will have lethargic heart.

164
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

165
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,240
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

166
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,160
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

167
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,960
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

168
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,000
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

169
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,240
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

170
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,880
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

171
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,000
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

172
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,240
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

173
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,720
then how do you give him Realization?

174
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

175
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,000
We have to have here chivalrous people,

176
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
brave people, warriors.

177
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,560
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

178
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,400
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

179
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,960
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

180
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,560
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

181
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:38,480
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

182
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,960
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

183
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,880
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

184
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,320
That one should eat. You can’t live with it.

185
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,000
So what I eat? Channa.

186
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,720
Can you live with channa? Is protein.

187
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,480
Channa, or you can eat meat.

188
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,000
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

189
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,400
and what I eat the most is honey.

190
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,240
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

191
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,720
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

192
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,000
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

193
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,000
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

194
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,560
But there should be no attention on food at all.

195
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

196
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,880
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,960
Really I'm very bad

198
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,720
because I have no attention on it.

199
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,240
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

200
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
What's so important

201
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,000
is to enjoy every moment of your life.
