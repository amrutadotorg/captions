00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.458
So yesterday was a nice day for all of us, and I said something

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:23.208
of a different level.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:26.083
We've been talking all the time

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:28.834
about the mundane things

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.500
and these things sometimes are very ...

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:47.709
are of so much importance, we think.

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.458
But when I talked to you yesterday,

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.709
I hope you all realized

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:58.000
that we have to now jump into

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.000
another realm of a subtler understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.208
First we are worried about

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.583
our families, our children,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.959
our households;

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.375
then, our marriages.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:24.083
One after another all these questions came up,

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:28.959
and we were concerned about all these things;

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:30.709
little, little things.

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.083
Then we also got concerned about the ashrams

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:35.625
which we were running:

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:37.709
the problems of the ashram,

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:40.333
what we have been doing,

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:46.125
how we have been facing the problems,

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.583
how people are creating problems.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.959
That's how our humanity started

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:58.125
acquiring a subtler understanding.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.709
And then we also realized that

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.792
we are blessed by God,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.917
that there's something great

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.333
that is always looking after us,

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:13.500
some higher Force,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.917
some special Attention is there about us.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.583
This is what we realized.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:30.125
Today I was explaining how it happens,

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:37.333
that how we realize

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.583
that God is helping us too.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.542
Any problem is an effect of some sort of a cause

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:53.041
- every problem.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:57.417
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:01.792
in a motorway

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.208
and the car went out of control,

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.041
and the brake would not act.

00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:12.834
And there was a car coming from the right,

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:14.417
car coming from the left,

00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:17.375
cars going through in front and behind.

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:20.875
And she felt that they'll be finished

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:24.166
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:32.375
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:36.999
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.041
So now, how to overcome that problem?

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.500
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.375
because cause is still there.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.625
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:53.667
Then what to do?

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.875
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:04.417
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.500
so the cause does not exist for you,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.667
so the effect does not exist for you.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.250
As long as the cause exists in your attention,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.375
the effect will be there.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.500
So what did she do?

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:19.458
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:24.375
"Mother, now it's my last chance" - that's all.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:29.709
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.917
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:42.458
So you must ascend away from the cause.

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:47.458
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.917
"my husband like this," "my family life is this,"

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:54.834
"Sahaja yogis are like this" - all kinds of things are there.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.917
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:01.083
- is such and such person.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.667
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:05.583
Surrender it.

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:09.250
You are, you have the right to do that.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:13.208
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.583
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.333
- but you don't do it, you forget.

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:21.667
You just forget.

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:27.542
If you surrender that cause,

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.709
the effects will go away.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.375
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.959
that you have to ascend.

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:42.583
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:46.083
So I've been playing with you.

00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:47.500
You had causes to say,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.709
"Oh Mother, this is the problem. I have no job."

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:52.125
Now I have a job, then the job is to be hard.

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:55.000
Then the wife is not there, so must have a wife.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.375
The wife has a problem, so she is to be divorced

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:00.500
- and that and that, and this is that.

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.000
Then, "I am like that.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.917
I am very bad because there's a bhoot in me."

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:06.834
So the bhoot is the cause.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:13.500
"And I am behaving like this because there's a bhoot in me."

00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:17.125
That's also a scapegoat, I think.

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:22.959
So first you go beyond that, saying,

00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:27.000
"What is bhoot? Who is bhoot?

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.792
I know my Mother.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.834
And Mother, You look after this bhoot of mine" - that's all.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.041
But for that an emergency has to come to you,

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:44.125
otherwise you just don't do it, with that power.

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.500
When you are in emergent condition,

00:06:47.834 --> 00:06:49.625
then it works out faster.

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:53.333
When it is not emergency then it's half-hearted,

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.792
like Mona's condition.

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:58.083
There was another case where a

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.917
journalist was traveling from ...

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:09.792
or something and his brakes broke down,

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:11.667
and he was with another journalist,

00:07:11.917 --> 00:07:14.750
so both of them were coming - this another journalist told me.

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.917
The another one was Sahaja yogi.

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.208
So he found his brakes are not working

00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:26.542
and he found his car is going,

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:28.875
in front there is a big truck coming up

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.083
and another truck coming from behind.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:34.667
And there was no way for him to turn or to get out of it,

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:36.458
and his brakes were horrid.

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:37.875
That was a emergency, you see.

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:41.166
Such an emergency that developed into his mind,

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.792
that "Oh God, now the last moment has come.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:46.166
Now we're finished."

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:48.917
There is a truck coming from there and another truck,

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:52.417
and within a split of a second he was to be finished.

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:56.542
And he just told his friend, "Think of Mother" - that's all.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:08:01.667
And what he found, that he was nicely crawling on the road

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:05.417
and the trucks were left behind, and the brake was working.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.333
But that emergency has to come.

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.625
Human beings are such that unless and until

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:17.792
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.875
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:26.542
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:29.999
because if you are an ascetic then you are in a tight corner.

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:34.083
They go to Gobi Desert to create that emergency within you,

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:35.667
so that you think of God.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:40.792
But that's too late to go to the Gobi Desert.

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:45.208
They create problems for them to get into tight corners,

00:08:45.208 --> 00:08:47.834
so that they can get out of it.

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:54.834
But for Sahaja yogis if they are wise, they need not have.

00:08:56.375 --> 00:09:01.750
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:04.125
Only way is meditation.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:08.834
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:11.959
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:15.125
You may be all right for a while

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.875
for two, three months, maybe two years,

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.583
but then you drop out.

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:23.291
Many people think, "Oh, what's the need to meditate?

00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:24.750
You see, it's all right.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.959
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:32.625
Because in meditation only you grow.

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:35.959
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.500
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.834
You just come up with a spring.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.834
But if you have to have continuous growth

00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:47.959
then you must meditate,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.417
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.417
and then allow them to subside,

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:02.375
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:05.709
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:09.000
And you grow in your detachment

00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:12.625
to the cause of all the effects.

00:10:14.834 --> 00:10:17.417
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

00:10:19.959 --> 00:10:21.750
But this is the problem with us,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.834
is that we do not meditate, normally.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.000
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.999
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:38.875
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.834
but you don't grow.

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:48.250
Growth can only come if you meditate.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:52.250
That is one very important part,

00:10:52.583 --> 00:11:00.959
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.709
In the normal life, how do we grow?

00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:07.500
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:10.041
We have to have sufficient oxygen,

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:11.875
we have to have sufficient food,

00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:13.834
we have to have all these things.

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:17.375
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:18.875
There's no way out.

00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:22.250
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:26.125
actually bumptious people,

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:29.166
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:32.709
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.125
They can give big lectures, this, that,

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.834
but have no vibrations at all.

00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.834
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:39.834 --> 00:11:41.000
they are not collective,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.375
they have no sense to be collective,

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:44.999
all kinds of problems.

00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:51.709
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.

00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:55.041
That is one part of it.

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:59.041
That is, we can say, is the worship, is the puja.

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:05.375
Then you don't have to give up anything,

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:07.166
you just become detached,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.834
detached from the cause itself.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.875
That's one part of it.

00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:20.542
Secondly, that this I would say will

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:24.625
take you to the subtler side of your emotional bindings,

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:28.291
because emotional binding has given you

00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:29.750
certain identification:

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.125
you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim,

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:36.834
or this and that, or a British or any kind of a race,

00:12:36.834 --> 00:12:38.999
or whatever you have to call it.

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.250
All those things will drop out,

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:44.125
because you get a detached personality.

00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:48.999
So these emotional bindings - "he is my brother,"

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.625
"she is my sister," "I am worried about my wife,"

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.542
"I am worried about my child"

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:55.875
- all these emotional bindings which

00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:02.709
make you a smaller personality will drop out,

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:04.625
and you'll have one emotional binding,

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:09.500
is that "I am growing in my compassion.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.875
Compassion is active, my compassion is effective.

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:16.750
My compassion is alight.

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.834
My compassion is this discretion.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.417
I am a yogi."

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.875
And secondly you read about Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:35.999
you know about Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:39.834
you know the technique of Sahaja yoga,

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:42.542
you raise your kundalini,

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.583
you clean your chakras,

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.375
try to understand about mantras.

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:50.750
You master your mantras,

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:53.834
you master your deities,

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.041
you please them.

00:13:56.542 --> 00:14:00.375
All these things when they are done properly,

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:04.291
then your mental bindings will drop out.

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.291
Those who think they are great scientists,

00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:12.709
they will know that all this is no science;

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:16.417
the science of God's technique is much more.

00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:18.667
Those who think that they are over-read,

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:22.083
well-read people, when they read about Sahaja Yoga

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:25.083
and work it out on themselves and see for themselves,

00:14:25.083 --> 00:14:26.959
and on others,

00:14:27.208 --> 00:14:30.125
they will know that whatever they have read is all stupid,

00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:32.500
has no meaning, is empty.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.208
And that's how a kind of an emptiness will come in,

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:40.709
emptiness of ego,

00:14:41.834 --> 00:14:45.083
because they'll see that knowledge is so great.

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:48.834
Like Newton said that "Knowledge is like an ocean,

00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:50.834
and I am like a little child

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:54.458
collecting some pebbles at its shore."

00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:57.917
What an understanding!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.208
So that emptiness comes in you,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.125
and then the real knowledge starts coming into you.

00:15:06.667 --> 00:15:09.458
The identification with real knowledge comes.

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:10.959
You talk;

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:14.083
when you talk, that talk has an effect - that's a mantra.

00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:15.375
You just don't jabber,

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:16.959
"Oh, I am in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:19.208
I have been in Sahaja Yoga for fifteen years"

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:21.125
- good for nothing.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.333
You may be there

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.667
for a hundred years but you may remain a donkey as donkey is,

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:30.458
absolutely.

00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:37.583
But you may have been there only for one year,

00:15:37.917 --> 00:15:40.125
and you may become from a donkey a human being,

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:41.917
and a yogi too.

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:47.250
But that is what we have to first of all

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:49.500
recondition ourselves,

00:15:49.792 --> 00:15:55.458
by attaching ourselves emotionally to Mother.

00:15:56.667 --> 00:15:58.333
I mean, you have an advantage

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:04.583
over many other yogis of the world who came, poor things,

00:16:04.583 --> 00:16:06.792
they had nothing to look forward.

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:10.208
They knew of a Primordial Mother, they knew about this,

00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:12.709
but they had no Form.

00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:15.375
You have a Form.

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:19.083
You are very fortunate and lucky people; you have a Form.

00:16:19.667 --> 00:16:23.667
It's easy to adore a Form than to adore something abstract

00:16:23.667 --> 00:16:25.000
in the air, do you see;

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.250
absolute consciousness,

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.333
how do you adore it when you can't see it?

00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:34.959
But that attachment doesn't mean in any way

00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:38.041
that you have to give Me anything.

00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:39.333
What do you give Me?

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:43.041
Nothing, but detachment from the cause.

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:49.500
And this works out - you have seen it in your lifetime.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.500
You also say that "It works out, Mother,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.999
somehow it worked out."

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:54.625
What is bandhan?

00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:57.875
It's nothing but you are attaching yourself to your Mother,

00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:00.041
you're just telephoning to Her.

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:03.667
This is a telephone going to your Mother,

00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:06.208
that's all.

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:08.291
You know I also play with you, I also say,

00:17:08.291 --> 00:17:10.750
"All right, I am giving you a bandhan."

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:14.291
I am giving bandhan to Myself!

00:17:14.542 --> 00:17:15.959
It's a telephone call,

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:17.834
just a telephone call.

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:20.542
But the faith has developed now that yes,

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:22.542
this is the real faith,

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:27.166
where you get completely detached in your emotional things.

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:30.375
It's just "My mother" - all right, just give her a bandhan,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.667
finished. "My father" - give him a bandhan.

00:17:32.667 --> 00:17:33.792
"My brother" - give him a bandhan,

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:35.333
whatever it is.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.041
Bandhan, whatever it is.

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:40.959
You are putting that ... in the bonds of your Mother.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:44.458
But you are not conscious that you are doing that.

00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.667
You are just binding them with the love of your Mother

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.291
which is flowing through your hands.

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:53.667
What are these vibrations, is your Mother's love.

00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.458
You've got it,

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.333
it is flowing through you.

00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:02.250
But what about your love for your Mother?

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:05.834
And that is what I find,

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:09.583
that at the time when there is complete emergency

00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:16.250
that surrender comes in, and it works.

00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:21.667
So there's no need to create any emergencies.

00:18:21.917 --> 00:18:26.125
You must slow and steadily work it out,

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:31.000
and it will build up by itself within you.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.792
You will have that power within you, I assure you.

00:18:33.792 --> 00:18:35.667
But meditation is one way;

00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:38.792
another is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:41.125
Not showing off, not telling others,

00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:44.000
but working it out in yourself - different chakras,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.250
how they work out,

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.917
on yourself, not on others.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:50.250
Once you start teaching others, it's a bhoot in you.

00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:53.709
You'd better learn it for yourself, even within yourself.

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:59.542
I know who has mastered which chakra, which ....

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:01.458
Nobody tell others that

00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:06.208
"this is the way to do it," that's absolute nonsensical ego.

00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:11.333
So such things should not be done.

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.917
If somebody asks you, you can tell

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:19.208
individually, but on a large scale you do not give lectures

00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.542
on that, and don't confuse people.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.542
Now, so we have two things,

00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:28.834
that we have to get over our emotional

00:19:29.083 --> 00:19:34.250
grossness and our mental grossness;

00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:37.333
same with our physical grossness.

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:41.917
Physical grossness can be overcome

00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:44.125
if you surrender yourself,

00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:52.000
to one medicine, is vibrations.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.250
Like Anupama, My grandchild, told her mother,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.208
"You are born in allopathy,

00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:00.333
then you are following homeopathy.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:02.709
Tomorrow you'll find out some jumbopathy,

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:04.999
then some numbopathy!

00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:09.667
So, but I am born in God

00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:13.333
and I follow only God's pathy,

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.208
and God will look after me

00:20:15.208 --> 00:20:17.542
and God will cure me."

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So My daughter said, "Why? You may also change."

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.542
She said, "Why?

00:20:22.542 --> 00:20:25.125
Because God never changes."

00:20:25.917 --> 00:20:29.834
Simple answer: God will cure you.

00:20:30.417 --> 00:20:36.709
But you must have that much ascent to say that,

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:40.083
as you just jump out at the time of emergency.

00:20:40.083 --> 00:20:42.083
Same sort of an urge,

00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:45.250
that same sort of a personality should be within you

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.667
to say that. Just if you say,

00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:51.542
"Oh God, please save me,"

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.917
God has no time for such people.

00:20:53.917 --> 00:20:57.709
You have no time for God, God has no time for you either

00:20:57.959 --> 00:20:59.709
- a simple thing.

00:21:00.583 --> 00:21:03.917
So from sublime to mundane things when we come,

00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:06.125
we exist in both the things

00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:07.834
and we are effective.

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:12.834
Whether we are in the lamp or in the light or in the oil,

00:21:13.917 --> 00:21:16.083
we are at a subtler point;

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.542
and we,

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:21.333
if we give the effectiveness

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:24.250
without being the cause.

00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:27.208
Because you are beyond the cause,

00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:31.375
so there is no need to create any cause for anything,

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:34.000
but you see the effect.

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:39.250
So once the cause is finished effect is achieved,

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.917
and it's achieved what is to be achieved,

00:21:43.333 --> 00:21:45.208
the correctness of it.

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:46.917
The correct thing you get.

00:21:46.917 --> 00:21:48.834
You do not get perverse thing,

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:52.000
but if you go with a cause then you can have perversity,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.125
you can have all kinds of problems.

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:58.125
So the best thing is to detach yourself from causes

00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:00.959
and then you get the effect,

00:22:00.959 --> 00:22:04.000
like as I told you that the brake got all right.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.166
The effect was there,

00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:06.625
the car was all right,

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:10.291
everything was fine so the effect was all right;

00:22:11.792 --> 00:22:13.041
but the cause was lost.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.166
There was no cause.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.917
Why? How?

00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:19.959
How the thing was perfected?

00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:24.291
If you ask the effect of it, you say how did you get it?

00:22:24.291 --> 00:22:26.166
You can't explain, it didn't work out.

00:22:26.875 --> 00:22:28.417
So because the cause is missing

00:22:28.417 --> 00:22:30.083
you cannot put it to any cause;

00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:33.291
you sometimes say it's divine the way it's worked out.

00:22:35.417 --> 00:22:41.999
So the only cause that is really effective is divinity.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.458
But the divinity should not be just as

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:52.000
a mundane sort of a thing,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.792
"All right, yes, Mother's photograph is there, namaste.

00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:58.458
Good. Namaste. Good morning, Mother" - finished.

00:22:59.291 --> 00:23:00.875
That's not the way.

00:23:00.875 --> 00:23:03.083
You have to know your Mother,

00:23:03.417 --> 00:23:06.083
and you have to love your Mother

00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:08.208
- that is what it is.

00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:11.125
It's very embarrassing to say that you must love Me.

00:23:13.917 --> 00:23:17.000
But as a Mother in this lifetime

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.999
I have had many embarrassing things,

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:21.458
and one of them is this,

00:23:21.458 --> 00:23:23.999
that I don't know how to tell the children.

00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:26.417
Now this is the fact.

00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:28.999
So you need not go through any emergencies

00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:30.458
or any such problems.

00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:32.999
You just develop yourself in such a way

00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:39.083
that you are so developed that it just acts and works out.

00:23:46.999 --> 00:23:51.333
So I'll give you a example of that.

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:53.083
It works the least in England,

00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:56.458
surprisingly, where I've worked the most

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.458
- least in England.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.458
I'll give you a simple example, now.

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:03.667
You see, your coming to India was decided

00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:05.291
I don't know how many months back.

00:24:05.291 --> 00:24:08.999
I have been to India once and I'm going second time,

00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:11.750
and England is the only place

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.750
where you have to pay your money directly.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.792
People have not yet paid,

00:24:16.792 --> 00:24:18.750
but Australians have done it.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.667
Australians, who are eighty, eighty-five people have done it,

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:25.333
but English have not done - everything they are slow.

00:24:25.333 --> 00:24:27.917
But when it comes to ego they are the first,

00:24:27.917 --> 00:24:29.667
their flags are the first.

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:33.999
In the ego, where is it generated? - in England the great.

00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:39.417
So when it comes to doing something they are the slowest,

00:24:39.417 --> 00:24:41.667
when it comes to criticism they are the highest,

00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:44.041
and then when it comes to the ego suddenly you'll see,

00:24:44.041 --> 00:24:45.709
give them any position,

00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:48.625
it's ....

00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:54.417
Why? Again you can explain, because there is a cause.

00:24:54.959 --> 00:24:56.417
You'll say it is inertia,

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:01.500
blame someone, or it's a bhoot,

00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:06.750
or it's my ego or my superego, it's not myself.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.500
Myself, I am all right.

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:10.542
Some cause.

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.542
Why you have not paid so far?

00:25:13.834 --> 00:25:14.959
It's such a problem;

00:25:14.959 --> 00:25:16.625
I have to go now.

00:25:18.834 --> 00:25:20.959
If you were not coming you should not have come,

00:25:20.959 --> 00:25:22.625
but if you are paying, you better pay for it.

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:24.667
Now, what's the matter with you?

00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:27.083
They started with fifty people,

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:29.083
now they end up with thirty-five.

00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:30.375
We have arranged for it,

00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:31.625
we have ordered for things and

00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:33.750
we have got the buses and all that;

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.250
now they are missing.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.999
Nobody asked you to come.

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:38.500
On the contrary I was saying,

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.999
"Keep it low. Keep it low, so that we'll make it nice."

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.834
But you cannot have less than 350

00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:46.208
or you can have three hundred,

00:25:46.208 --> 00:25:47.667
you can have two hundred,

00:25:47.667 --> 00:25:50.917
but you cannot just have 210.

00:25:50.917 --> 00:25:52.500
Where to put them?

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.083
A simple thing - see all the mundane style.

00:25:55.834 --> 00:25:57.709
But in other places what they have done?

00:25:57.709 --> 00:26:00.000
"All right, we have to go. Mother will work it out."

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.834
It's worked out.

00:26:00.834 --> 00:26:03.709
Everybody has got money, everything done, it's all here.

00:26:04.792 --> 00:26:06.834
Americans have done it, surprisingly,

00:26:06.834 --> 00:26:08.500
but English

00:26:09.208 --> 00:26:13.500
- they don't know whether they are going or not.

00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:17.208
Still there are some.

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:20.250
Poor Gavin has to run up and down for all of you.

00:26:20.583 --> 00:26:23.208
I tell you, he is the one who has such patience.

00:26:23.208 --> 00:26:24.792
And I was amazed

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.834
that there are still eleven people who have not paid,

00:26:29.834 --> 00:26:31.583
can you believe it?

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:33.792
I mean, it's such a simple thing.

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:35.375
If you don't want to go, don't go.

00:26:35.375 --> 00:26:36.667
If you want to go, you go.

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:39.375
Tell him you are not going or you are going, finished.

00:26:39.375 --> 00:26:41.917
I mean, nobody wants you there.

00:26:41.917 --> 00:26:44.083
But even this little thing you cannot because

00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:46.375
you have a kind of a ...

00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:49.792
because, because this has happened,

00:26:49.792 --> 00:26:53.750
because that has happened, because ...

00:26:58.041 --> 00:27:00.166
So the English have to come up much more,

00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:02.959
because I have really worked for you people very, very hard,

00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:06.166
and again God has given Me work again five years more;

00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.875
I don't know what we are going to do.

00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:12.750
Sometimes I feel I should not be back, because no use.

00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:17.333
This is a small example I am giving,

00:27:18.291 --> 00:27:19.542
very small example,

00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:20.875
it's very mundane type.

00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:23.875
You can see in other places also, like that.

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:25.166
You tell them anything,

00:27:25.166 --> 00:27:28.291
"But why, Mother, it happens like that?

00:27:28.542 --> 00:27:30.083
Why do I do like this?"

00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:34.417
I mean, asking Me a question, asking Me the cause!

00:27:34.417 --> 00:27:38.667
"Why did I behave like this? Why do I get into temper?"

00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:42.333
Like I have known people

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:43.792
who have been coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:43.792 --> 00:27:45.500
doing Sahaja Yoga and all that,

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.959
but then they go to some other Steiner's place.

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.959
Then they go to some other courses.

00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:56.625
I mean, they have no faith in Me - Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:57.875 --> 00:28:00.999
They are practicing this, they are practicing that like mad,

00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:02.417
still going on.

00:28:02.417 --> 00:28:04.999
That's only possible in England, I tell you,

00:28:05.208 --> 00:28:07.750
nowhere else - it's a speciality.

00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:11.417
I have known of so many people who came to Sahaja Yoga;

00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:13.625
without practicing Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:17.166
curing, helping them in Sahaja Yoga, working it out.

00:28:17.417 --> 00:28:19.375
They leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:22.792
They're going to this place, that place, that ....

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:25.208
Is this the way?

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:33.333
Now I have known lots of people who

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:35.667
try to blame the leadership.

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:37.375
I am telling you all these things because

00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:40.250
I was very sick when I came here, really I tell you,

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.458
I was sick for eight days and I was sick even afterwards;

00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:46.667
because you know, you are all in My body and I suffer,

00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:48.208
so I must tell you.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:50.917
And then they say the leadership is no good,

00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:53.500
leader should be very strong, the leader should be this,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.041
and their leader must have a big thing in his hand,

00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:57.291
and they said if he hits us,

00:28:57.291 --> 00:28:59.750
we are not going to be all right.

00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:03.792
Again the cause; again the cause.

00:29:04.041 --> 00:29:07.333
I tell you, you have one of the best leaders in Gavin,

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:08.999
and I must tell you,

00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.792
he is the man who spent a lot of money.

00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:14.333
Without telling Me he has covered many expenses,

00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:16.208
his office has worked for us.

00:29:16.542 --> 00:29:18.291
He took all nonsensical people.

00:29:18.542 --> 00:29:20.667
If I told him, "This fellow is getting some ego,"

00:29:20.917 --> 00:29:22.625
he'll employ in his office.

00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:24.333
If I say, "This fellow has got bhoots,"

00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:26.083
he'll employ in his office.

00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:29.041
He has worked with such bhoots

00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.750
that I could not manage them even for a day.

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:39.041
He tries his level best to go to people and tell them that,

00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:40.166
"See now, come."

00:29:40.166 --> 00:29:42.333
He has saved so many people

00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:44.667
by his sense, by his understanding;

00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:46.917
but the only thing is he, openly he doesn't lead,

00:29:46.917 --> 00:29:48.041
that's his mistake.

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.083
He should openly tell,

00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:52.083
"You are a bhoot and get cured, then you'll be all right."

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:53.250
But if you say,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.250
"Come here. You see, you are a bhoot, doesn't matter.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.500
I have got lemons, ..., chillies. You sit down."

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.500
Then, "Mother,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.333
he is identifying himself with the greatest bhoot."

00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:05.583
Let us face it.

00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:10.959
If you have understanding of your leader,

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.917
then you should know that I know better than you know

00:30:15.834 --> 00:30:17.291
about it.

00:30:19.375 --> 00:30:21.458
And this is very saddening sometimes.

00:30:21.458 --> 00:30:24.583
Why don't you understand the sheer goodness of a person?

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:28.250
The amount of bhoots he has tolerated in his office,

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.166
I tell you, I can't stand them for more than one day,

00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:32.667
some of them.

00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:35.375
So egoistical, some of them, off their heads,

00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:38.166
and some of them are so bhootish

00:30:38.959 --> 00:30:40.417
that even if they come downstairs

00:30:40.417 --> 00:30:44.166
I get a pain in the stomach, in My house.

00:30:44.166 --> 00:30:46.291
But he stood them.

00:30:46.959 --> 00:30:49.041
Why? What was the need?

00:30:49.709 --> 00:30:52.208
Just that he thought that he'd help them.

00:30:52.208 --> 00:30:54.291
Whenever I told him that "This person is bhootish,"

00:30:54.291 --> 00:30:56.999
I find him employed by Mr Gavin Brown.

00:30:58.542 --> 00:31:01.083
Then one day I had to tell him, "Sack all of them,"

00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:03.208
and they were sacked.

00:31:05.083 --> 00:31:07.542
Why do we have the maximum number of bhoots in England,

00:31:07.542 --> 00:31:09.250
I can't understand.

00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:11.500
Is it necessary to have them around?

00:31:13.875 --> 00:31:16.750
On the day when I am going I should not tell you these things,

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.999
but when I go away I find these bhoots come back,

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:24.625
and they become the causes, and the effects are shown.

00:31:25.959 --> 00:31:31.041
So I have to make a complete open picture to you

00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:35.041
to see that you can ascend to the highest of highest,

00:31:35.375 --> 00:31:38.166
being born on this great land of this country.

00:31:39.083 --> 00:31:42.667
But you can also go very down, I have seen that.

00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:45.667
Because you're always blaming someone,

00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:49.166
last of all Gavin,

00:31:49.166 --> 00:31:52.417
and this is the worst thing that you have done.

00:31:52.417 --> 00:31:54.500
Let anybody say that to Gregoire -

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.417
he'll chop that person off ten times

00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:59.458
and bring that person to me in chopped stages!

00:32:01.166 --> 00:32:02.875
Really, I mean!

00:32:03.625 --> 00:32:05.041
He'll say, "What nonsense!

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:07.208
All right, it's ... go ahead."

00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:11.458
You tell Mr.Warren,

00:32:11.458 --> 00:32:14.417
I don't know what he'll do with all of the Australian type.

00:32:14.792 --> 00:32:16.625
They are all gems, no doubt.

00:32:16.917 --> 00:32:20.083
But you deserve a man like Gavin.

00:32:20.458 --> 00:32:24.166
I thought, they are special people

00:32:24.417 --> 00:32:26.625
that I've worked for you so much,

00:32:26.875 --> 00:32:28.667
but I am amazed.

00:32:29.792 --> 00:32:33.166
The decent people don't need such leaders, do you?

00:32:34.417 --> 00:32:36.458
But the people who are decent now

00:32:36.458 --> 00:32:39.208
turn out to be Australians, surprisingly,

00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:41.542
the way they behave towards Me:

00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:43.875
so sweet they are, you'd be surprised,

00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:45.333
the children you know.

00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:48.959
Gavin, he bought some cups and saucers for Me

00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:52.166
because when I go there they thought they'll give Me tea

00:32:52.166 --> 00:32:53.959
in good cups and saucers.

00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:56.375
So he bought for all the centers one cup and saucer,

00:32:56.625 --> 00:32:57.625
good one.

00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:59.291
So the children, little, little children,

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:00.458
they collected money;

00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:04.041
after all, Mother will have a cake, also must have a plate.

00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:07.583
So they sent a check here, just see - how sweet!

00:33:08.834 --> 00:33:11.375
But I never eat cakes, you know that, but still

00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:16.750
- so sweet the children, I should say.

00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:20.625
What is the reason?

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:24.625
Why do we dominate or get dominated?

00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:25.625
Why?

00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:31.917
Again the cause.

00:33:32.458 --> 00:33:34.458
Go beyond the cause.

00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:38.125
I bless you again and again that when I come next time,

00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:41.000
see that you don't make any mistakes anymore.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Meditate and meditate and meditate,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.792
and when you come to India some of you,

00:33:44.792 --> 00:33:47.709
I would like to show you as my prize things

00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:50.000
from where I've worked, you know.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.834
Even where I've not been, you see,

00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:56.125
somebody else has given realization to someone in Nepal,

00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:57.792
you see,

00:33:57.792 --> 00:33:59.542
and they are wonderful flowers;

00:33:59.542 --> 00:34:02.709
and here am I, something wrong with Me!

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:04.999
Where I have worked,

00:34:06.917 --> 00:34:10.250
people are more worried about the causes.

00:34:10.542 --> 00:34:12.875
I have to really make a very, very

00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:16.792
straightforward appeal to you that now,

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:19.166
grow within yourself.

00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:20.709
Are you magnanimous,

00:34:20.999 --> 00:34:21.917
are you generous,

00:34:21.917 --> 00:34:23.458
are you systematic?

00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:25.542
Are you impressive,

00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:26.417
are you kind,

00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:28.083
are you collective?

00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:32.709
Are you attached to all these nonsensical things still?

00:34:32.709 --> 00:34:34.583
Do you talk big,

00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:36.583
do you give big lectures?

00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:39.709
Humble down yourself,

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:41.999
and then you'll see your greatness.

00:34:41.999 --> 00:34:44.375
Unless and until you put your head down to your heart,

00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:46.291
how will you see your Mother?

00:34:52.417 --> 00:34:54.625
I wish you all great luck now,

00:34:54.875 --> 00:34:58.999
and happy Christmas to you and happy New Year,

00:34:59.208 --> 00:35:02.208
and a very great New Year in spiritual growth.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.500
Let's show it.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.375
Let all of us decide today.

00:35:05.667 --> 00:35:07.999
Forget about your wives and husbands and children,

00:35:07.999 --> 00:35:09.291
and this and that nonsense.

00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:13.750
Now you are yogis, you are united with Divine.

00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:15.959
Grow in it, prosper in it.

00:35:17.083 --> 00:35:18.999
May God bless you all.

00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:35.375
Now the today's program

00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:37.542
should not be very big because we are not allowed

00:35:37.542 --> 00:35:38.834
lot of time,

00:35:38.834 --> 00:35:42.625
but it's nice that today we could have a little puja of farewell.

00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:45.250
But it should be a very small ... because it is,

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.999
how much you receive is the point,

00:35:47.999 --> 00:35:51.291
because before going I don't want to have all kinds of chakras,

00:35:51.291 --> 00:35:53.750
you see, going into spasms.

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.999
I am sometimes afraid of a puja in England.

00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:06.041
Gavin, I think you can just ...

00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:15.959
It's the mastery.

00:36:15.959 --> 00:36:17.583
You must have the mastery,

00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:19.125
upon yourself first of all.

00:36:19.125 --> 00:36:20.959
If you are not a master you cannot act

00:36:20.959 --> 00:36:23.834
- and upon your instrument, that's the point.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.625
And I would not like anybody to disrespect

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:35.709
the leaders at all.

00:36:35.709 --> 00:36:38.959
You may be very intelligent, that's outside Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.458
In Sahaja Yoga you have to listen to your leaders

00:36:41.458 --> 00:36:44.500
and respect, and nobody should try to find faults.

00:36:45.166 --> 00:36:47.709
I know his faults, what are his faults are,

00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:49.834
and I know how to deal with them.

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.917
Everybody should try to strengthen.

00:36:51.917 --> 00:36:57.000
Now I would say in Australia, which is a modern thing,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:02.250
I should say that the whole thing works like one body.

00:37:03.458 --> 00:37:05.709
Nobody questions Warren.

00:37:06.375 --> 00:37:10.041
They telephone to him, they tell him, they collect money,

00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:13.583
they put the money - it's all working like one body.

00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:16.625
Here everybody is trying to cut the head

00:37:16.917 --> 00:37:17.999
- or attack the heart;

00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:27.375
that's your heart, that's your brain.

00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:32.750
So please remember all of you should offer services

00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:34.709
to Gavin,

00:37:34.959 --> 00:37:36.166
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:36.417 --> 00:37:38.458
before criticizing.

00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.208
Those who say the books are not arriving,

00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:42.875
let them take over the books.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:51.417
Even booking My seats and all that he has to run, I know;

00:37:51.667 --> 00:37:55.500
whatever you may say about ... he used to do all this.

00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:01.041
So you should offer your services also,

00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:03.417
to do these jobs.

00:38:03.417 --> 00:38:06.041
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out.

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.625
We are not only here to take blessings

00:38:08.625 --> 00:38:11.083
but we have certain duties also,

00:38:11.083 --> 00:38:13.291
and that's what everybody should offer,

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.375
their measure: what can I do, how can I help?

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.875
What is the work? Let's see now.

00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:26.417
I hope in the next meeting you all should sit down

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:28.625
and find out what you can do.

00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:32.500
A group can be formed: two, three persons can sit and do it

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.041
with love, with attention,

00:38:35.625 --> 00:38:38.166
so that his burden will be reduced, and you will all feel

00:38:38.166 --> 00:38:40.417
the joy that you are doing something for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:40.709 --> 00:38:42.125
Mother has done so much for you,

00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:44.250
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.834
You want to have nice ashrams,

00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.417
nice place to live there,

00:38:49.709 --> 00:38:51.041
all right.

00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:53.500
You want to have comfortable places, cheaper places,

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.834
all right.

00:38:55.125 --> 00:38:56.166
You want to have good health,

00:38:56.166 --> 00:38:57.125
all right.

00:38:57.125 --> 00:39:00.834
You want to have fine children, all right; enjoy your life.

00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:04.458
But what about giving,

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.625
giving your heart,

00:39:09.375 --> 00:39:11.500
your respect?

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:15.917
Next time when I come back,

00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:20.250
I want to see that you are all growing as one body.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.709
At least the Heart should be integrated,

00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:24.375
if nothing else.

00:39:24.625 --> 00:39:25.917
Imagine a heart

00:39:25.917 --> 00:39:28.709
which has the valves which pulsates at various times,

00:39:28.709 --> 00:39:34.041
all muscles going at different wavelengths.

00:39:34.834 --> 00:39:38.041
How can this universe survive with a heart like this?

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:43.041
So I have to request all the,

00:39:43.291 --> 00:39:47.041
all the cells of the Heart to be alert,

00:39:47.041 --> 00:39:49.625
to be one in unison with God,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.583
and in loving care of the whole universe.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.166
May God bless you.

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:05.250
So what is this puja supposed to be today?

00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:09.166
It's farewell puja

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.999
today, so let's have it,

00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:15.417
just before the birth of Christ.

00:40:15.417 --> 00:40:18.041
Let Christ be born within us.

00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:20.709
Let's be, like Him,

00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:24.417
the one who always insisted,

00:40:25.166 --> 00:40:27.875
"Love your brothers. Love your sisters."

00:40:27.875 --> 00:40:29.750
Who are your brothers and sisters?

00:40:29.999 --> 00:40:31.375
He asked the question too,

00:40:31.625 --> 00:40:34.291
"Who are My brothers and sisters?"

00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:37.291
"Sahaja yogis are my brothers and sisters."

00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:41.000
Somebody offered at the altar.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.875
He said, "What are you to offer at the altar?

00:40:43.875 --> 00:40:46.333
Have you reconciled with your brother?"

00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:48.458
Have you reconciled?

00:40:48.917 --> 00:40:52.458
First reconcile, and then bring flowers to Mother.

00:40:55.333 --> 00:40:57.417
He said it already.

00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:02.625
Think of Him, how forgiving He was,

00:41:03.417 --> 00:41:06.542
how magnanimous, how great, and how

00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:09.458
He thought of His Father all the time,

00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:11.291
completely dedicated,

00:41:13.291 --> 00:41:15.000
doing His work.

00:41:17.917 --> 00:41:20.917
So with all praises to Christ

00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:23.625
and to His Mother who worked

00:41:23.917 --> 00:41:25.917
in a very potential manner,

00:41:27.333 --> 00:41:30.291
we have to today within ourselves

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.917
awaken that great Spirit,

00:41:34.166 --> 00:41:37.291
which is actually the Aumkara.

00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:43.417
Even the memory,

00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:45.625
even the idea of that

00:41:46.417 --> 00:41:48.542
is so joy-giving.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.917
Let His life be reflected in your lives.

00:41:53.875 --> 00:41:57.625
You have to be true Christians.

00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:07.834
Let's have ... what is it? ....

00:42:10.959 --> 00:42:16.542
I think ... Now I would say, next time when you come to puja,

00:42:16.542 --> 00:42:18.250
all of you must have

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.959
the hundred-and-eight names of the Goddess.

00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:23.291
You must have all the papers that are there.

00:42:23.542 --> 00:42:25.417
Like we have these books,

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.291
all of us must have these papers,

00:42:28.542 --> 00:42:30.709
not only one person should have.

00:42:31.083 --> 00:42:33.875
We should try to remember certain things also:

00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:35.083
the names of the Goddess,

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:36.959
the names that we recite.

00:42:36.959 --> 00:42:39.417
We should read them again and again and understand them,

00:42:39.417 --> 00:42:41.083
the Sanskrit meaning of it.

00:42:43.166 --> 00:42:44.999
And it should come to us very easily,

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:48.291
because that is how we are going to work out our chakras.

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:52.750
I don't think we have names of Christ,

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.000
it's all right,

00:42:54.458 --> 00:42:57.125
and this time I hope we will try to

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:00.250
read some names of Christ.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:03.709
But we have the names of Ganesha but not of Christ,

00:43:03.709 --> 00:43:07.625
so we'll say the hundred-and-eight names of Shri Ganesh,

00:43:07.959 --> 00:43:11.458
and somebody can wash My feet, all right ....

00:43:16.542 --> 00:43:17.583
Have you?

00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:20.083
Well really, that's the best.

00:43:25.917 --> 00:43:28.834
But so, I would say somebody should say now, let's see.

00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:30.208
How many names we have? ....

00:43:30.208 --> 00:43:34.125
Let Me create the names, and we'll give it to others.

00:43:34.709 --> 00:43:37.667
Why should only Gavin keep the names?

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:49.083
It's not like a prime minister of this country,

00:43:49.083 --> 00:43:50.917
you have chosen the leader.

00:43:50.917 --> 00:43:53.125
Prime minister is paid money for,

00:43:54.333 --> 00:43:57.792
she's - that's her job she is doing.

00:43:58.333 --> 00:44:00.333
He is not doing his job.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.458
You all are doing the job of God.

00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:08.917
So why should there be any such thing that ...

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.834
Now somebody should read it,

00:44:14.083 --> 00:44:16.000
and somebody can.

00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:24.750
Now who will read it?

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.959
Now somebody should read it and somebody can wash My feet.

00:44:27.959 --> 00:44:29.625
But don't do it too much, eh?

00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:33.750
This is Christ - it's not easy to absorb.

00:44:34.417 --> 00:44:36.166
All right, let's see.

00:44:36.542 --> 00:44:39.375
Let's see how much love you have for Him,

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.750
how much you absorb Him ...

00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:47.667
Get up now.

00:44:47.917 --> 00:44:50.458
So you must get up to help, some of you.

00:44:54.999 --> 00:44:56.542
And others also.

00:44:56.542 --> 00:44:59.834
There's nothing to fear that there is ego or anything.

00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:01.709
Don't keep back thinking,

00:45:01.709 --> 00:45:04.583
"Oh, they think I'm just being ... " -  no, run!

00:45:04.834 --> 00:45:06.333
Run for the job.

00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:09.917
Now, what is it?

00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:14.250
Get some things what you need.

00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:17.250

in rituals - what makes you  think?

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:12.083
The rituals which are real ...

00:51:17.458 --> 00:51:18.834
See, the one who is riches,

00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:21.125
how can He be interested in riches?

00:51:22.917 --> 00:51:25.834
That's the point ...

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.709
Riches He is.

00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:30.709
Not interested at all, because He being the riches

- that is gunatita, as you call it - you see,

00:51:33.917 --> 00:51:35.000
the being and the non-being.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.500
When you are the non-being,

00:51:36.792 --> 00:51:38.709
you cannot be interested in the being.

00:51:41.333 --> 00:51:43.250
Beyond, He is beyond.

00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:50.917
He is the  sacred heart.

00:51:54.583 --> 00:51:56.583

He is angry with materialists.

00:53:26.166 --> 00:53:30.291
He destroys ego and absorbs superego.

00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:34.458
He is the destroyer of desires.

00:53:35.125 --> 00:53:37.625
He is the pure power of desire.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.625
His church is the heart.

00:53:44.458 --> 00:53:47.000
He has the eleven destroying powers.

00:53:48.375 --> 00:53:50.291
He is the destroyer of false prophets.

00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:52.875
He is the destroyer of untruth.

00:53:53.583 --> 00:53:55.625
He is the destroyer of intolerance.

He is the destroyer of racialism.

00:53:59.583 --> 00:54:01.458
He is the destroyer of anger.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:06.583
Of fanaticism - it's very much so.

00:54:09.125 --> 00:54:11.166
He is the herald of the Golden Age.

00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:15.000
He is worshipped by our Mother.

00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:17.875
He is praised by our Mother.

00:54:18.625 --> 00:54:20.583
He is loved by our Mother.

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.500
He is the one who is chosen.

00:54:25.375 --> 00:54:28.000
He is awakened in all Sahaja yogis.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:33.125
He who rides the white horse at the end of the age.

00:54:35.125 --> 00:54:37.166
He is the end of our fears.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.250
He guards the gate of our Mother.

00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:45.000
He is the only way to the Kingdom of God.

00:54:47.125 --> 00:54:49.875
Aum Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahavishnu sakshat

00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:51.375
Shri Mahavirata sakshat

00:54:51.375 --> 00:54:53.625
Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

00:54:53.625 --> 00:54:56.583
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:54.000
I think the word "worshipped" should be "adored by our Mother"

00:57:54.333 --> 00:57:55.625
because He didn't like it, I think,

00:57:55.625 --> 00:57:57.041
it's catching on the Agnya.

00:57:57.709 --> 00:57:59.500
So it's "is adored by."

00:57:59.792 --> 00:58:02.583
See, He's so particular - you see,

00:58:02.583 --> 00:58:05.500
the protocol is not all right, that's why.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.500
See - better!

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.458
Agnya was fine. See?

00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:13.458
Some catches there are.

00:58:13.458 --> 00:58:16.166
I was wondering which one of them was.

00:58:16.166 --> 00:58:19.000
Now we'll say, "He is adored by our Mother."

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.709
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:21.917 --> 00:58:23.041
Again, three times.

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.792
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.166
Again.

00:58:26.166 --> 00:58:27.709
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.500
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.208
See? He's very particular.

00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:36.792
May God bless you.

00:58:46.291 --> 00:58:47.041
You got the meaning of that?

01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:14.458
The description of Mahalakshmi, what She gives you,

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:21.250
and also the description about Her relationship with Vishnu,

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:24.000
with Hari - is Shri Krishna,

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:26.959
that She is the beloved of Shri Krishna (Hari)

01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:30.125
Is the beloved of Shri Krishna;

01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:32.959
and that's how it explains how Mahalakshmi,

01:04:33.166 --> 01:04:36.458
if She is Mary, then Mary is Radha.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.500
This has to be done by boys

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:11.250
who haven't got the feeling of marriage,

01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:15.709
or think of it. It has to be that pure.
