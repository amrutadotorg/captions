00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:11.710
I went to your radio broadcasting
and people told Me

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:23.249
that, "It is very difficult to believe, that
we can get Self-realization so easily."

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:36.335
Also that, "The whole thing sounds so 
fantastic, so great and how can

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:40.898
we human-beings get our realization
so fast."

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:50.852
We must know that we have not created
ourselves

00:00:54.423 --> 00:01:01.693
and we cannot create ourselves either; We
can destroy but we have not created ourselves.

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:09.906
Some energy, some force - call it God, 
call it anything - has created us

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:20.392
and the way we have become human-beings,
one can see very clearly,

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:34.983
there has to be some purpose. If so,
then we have to find out that purpose.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:48.893
Logically, we reach a conclusion, that
whatever we know today about ourselves

00:01:48.893 --> 00:02:04.138
and our being and our purpose, is not 
sufficient to convince us of

00:02:05.498 --> 00:02:12.217
our importance, of our glory and the
need for this force to create us.

00:02:17.227 --> 00:02:28.957
To understand what it is, why are we
here, why are we made human-beings

00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:39.055
- are we able to find out with this
human instrument we have got?

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:43.928
With our human awareness can we
find out why are we here,

00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:55.698
why are we made or is there anything
else provided within us that can give us

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:13.663
the ideas, the knowledge about ourselves.
One thing is definite, we must understand

00:03:13.663 --> 00:03:22.144
that in these modern times, there are many
people born, who do not accept life as it is.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:31.669
They perhaps do not know for what purpose
but they want to deny and defy a revolt against

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:38.787
the mundane type of life they think
there's something missing in it.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.660
They have not been able to find why they
are here. Perhaps, they think

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:51.622
the joy is missing in life and what
is the purpose of our life.

00:03:56.627 --> 00:04:06.147
But when we start our search in this 
direction to find why we are restless,

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:12.227
why we are dissatisfied, then we get lost.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:25.920
It's like, we have come now to Brighton by
train and there is no train to go to a

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.594
particular point any more. Now, if you 
give up the train, there is no bridge

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:37.794
and how to reach there. Everything seems
to be unknown also we do not know

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:43.384
what are we seeking, though we feel that we 
are seeking the Truth behind everything else.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:56.429
Then, with our reasoning, we have to
understand what are we seeking

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:01.480
first of all. Then how are we to seek?

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:14.526
The normal way of seeking anything,
for example, your power, your money

00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:22.898
your wealth, has to be changed. There
has to be some other method by which

00:05:23.478 --> 00:05:29.554
you have to seek that which is
innately missing in you

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:39.924
and that cannot be anything that
you have known so far.

00:05:41.534 --> 00:05:46.742
If you had known that so far, you 
would not have been seeking.

00:05:48.652 --> 00:06:00.922
You go to Science, you go to Arts, you go 
to any field of knowledge, you will find

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:13.782
there is no way by which you can be guided
to this new awareness that you are seeking

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.200
Naturally, you are mislaid - anybody can
mislead you because you are going to an

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:31.230
unknown realm and anybody can mislead
you. Moreover, there are so many books

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:41.327
about the unknown that it is not easy for us
to discriminate. We have got person like Hume,

00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:51.580
who doesn't have much support in U.K.,
who was a realized soul and what he talked

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:59.493
about the Truth, according to Me, is perfect.
Then, we have another one, called Mr. Freud,

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:07.917
whom I call a very half-baked gentleman,
while many would not agree with Me there

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:17.360
and there could be so many like that, 
where we do not know how to discriminate.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.980
So many books have appeared, so many
things have been placed before you,

00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:32.330
so many ideologies, so many fake gurus
- I could be one of them same time,

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:39.826
maybe trying to deceive you to get something
out of you - possible. All these things are

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:49.788
so much, that I can understand you all are
so much confused. But if I were a seeker,

00:07:51.277 --> 00:08:01.277
in a simple way, obviously, what would
I do? First of all, supposing, you are

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:06.723
going into a market-place to buy
something, what do you do?

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:18.380
You go and find out from others, those
who have purchased things from the place,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:24.930
how it is. Is it good, is it doing good
to you, is it working alright?

00:08:26.835 --> 00:08:31.295
You just don't buy anything
because it is advertised;

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:46.426
At least a shallow person may do such a
thing but not a person, who has earned

00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:51.340
his money with great difficulties and who
understands the value of his money.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.490
He won't just go by and buy something
because it is advertised in a big way.

00:08:58.469 --> 00:09:04.549
So, what are the things that one has to do,
is to find out, those who have been going

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:11.900
to all these different alternatives, what
have they achieved and what am I going

00:09:11.902 --> 00:09:19.952
to achieve it? Now the first thing we say
that, you get something in your awareness

00:09:19.952 --> 00:09:27.266
if it is a living evolutionary process. In
your awareness you have a sense of color

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:35.679
you have a sense of beauty, you have a 
sense of cleanliness. In your awareness,

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:46.435
means in your Central Nervous System,
whatever you have achieved, you can feel it

00:09:46.939 --> 00:09:55.279
and understand it. If some thing is hot,
you know it is hot, if something is tasty,

00:09:55.279 --> 00:10:01.933
you know it is tasty; In the same way, the
Central Nervous System that is built-in

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:11.919
within you, which is your own, you
should feel whatever you have achieved.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:18.869
It's not just a, sort of a, brainwash
people can give you. Like if I say,

00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:23.285
alright, this is not red - this is green.
You say,

00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:28.316
"No, I see it red and it is red - that's
the truth - I can see it with my eyes."

00:10:28.347 --> 00:10:35.167
Supposing I say, "No, this is not wood, 
this is foam," you can feel it, "No,

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:44.573
this is definitely wood not foam," you can
feel it and as a seeker you must know that

00:10:44.573 --> 00:10:52.654
you have to feel it yourself, not your 
emotional methods, not your mental method.

00:10:52.654 --> 00:10:58.533
To a person emotionally a flower may be
very important because it's given to

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:08.456
her or him by somebody whom he loved
very much but to everyone that feeling

00:11:08.456 --> 00:11:14.124
should be the same. Wood should be the
same for everyone of you. God should be

00:11:14.124 --> 00:11:22.791
the same for all of you by all it's tests
- then you have found something.

00:11:24.621 --> 00:11:30.711
It cannot be the whim of one person, "O, I've
found God. Now I'm great, I've done this, I'm,"

00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:42.878
but, what is the criteria? It has to be a
criteria which is supported by everyone

00:11:43.129 --> 00:11:49.669
but here also they can beat you, I can
tell you. Supposing, I have a power

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:55.785
by which I mesmerize all of you. You'll all say
that, "Our Mother is this, Mother is that."

00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:06.278
Here, we should go further to understand
that you may say anything about Me

00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:13.478
or say, "I'm above everything and
I'm this and I'm that,"

00:12:15.128 --> 00:12:19.128
and anybody can say like that
and advertise about Me

00:12:20.318 --> 00:12:27.668
but to you, who is a seeker, that's
not important. You are not going to be

00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:33.312
a hero worshipper. Just to worship
somebody because you think that

00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:38.137
such a big hero is there - now those days
are gone. The days have come when you

00:12:38.137 --> 00:12:44.782
have to become the hero, where you
have to become something.

00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:53.422
A time was there where there were
very few horse-riders,

00:12:54.512 --> 00:12:59.162
so we used to be enamored by them,
"Oh, such a one is there."

00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:05.012
Even today, the footballers. We appreciate
them, they are our heroes,

00:13:05.012 --> 00:13:11.175
watch them, the globe-trotters, we watch
them but today you have to become that,

00:13:11.175 --> 00:13:18.498
you have to become your master, you have
to know everything; That is the time today

00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:26.312
otherwise no use seeking. Are you seeking
another hero for yourself? Is that hero

00:13:26.312 --> 00:13:33.769
going to take you somewhere or he's just
going to use you for his own hero worship?

00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:41.412
So, the second point is that what
have you become out of it.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:46.244
When you see somebody,
whom you want to judge -

00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:56.511
a disciple of anyone - you should know 
what have you got, what did you gain

00:13:56.821 --> 00:14:06.011
because you have to gain something out of
it. That's how, you will start neutralizing

00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:20.001
many people and the last of all, if the
seeking has to be fulfilled, it cannot be

00:14:20.001 --> 00:14:23.987
done the way you have been doing all
other things like paying money.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:36.260
If you pay money, you might even get a
seat in the Parliament, maybe or maybe that,

00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:43.345
if you do some social service or something,
you might might gain popular votes

00:14:45.803 --> 00:14:52.063
but you have to change that - that is not
the way you are going to achieve.

00:14:53.617 --> 00:14:59.937
In this new realm of seeking, it has to
be a living process of evolution.

00:15:00.964 --> 00:15:12.564
Under these circumstances, when it is going to
be a new method, it has to be a living method.

00:15:13.555 --> 00:15:18.205
Please come, here there's a room here.
Yes, there's room here. It's alright.

00:15:18.603 --> 00:15:24.493
Now, the living method we, human-beings
don't know. We know and we don't know.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:32.960
For example, as I told you yesterday, if
you have to sprout the seed, then

00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:39.855
you know that you have to put it in the
Mother Earth and it will sprout but

00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:45.920
you don't know how it works; You don't 
know that. Anything living you do not know

00:15:46.377 --> 00:15:52.703
but you know how it happens. You do not
know how to convert a flower into a fruit

00:15:52.728 --> 00:15:59.998
- you do not know, despite all your Science,
everything put together but the living process

00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:05.921
produces all these results, this you know 
but how it works, that you don't know.

00:16:07.888 --> 00:16:15.808
So, if it is the living process, it's a
very different method, which is not so far

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:25.686
known to human-beings. So, logically you 
reach a point, where you try to understand

00:16:25.686 --> 00:16:34.273
the living processes, how they work. Firstly,
all living processes are spontaneous -

00:16:34.273 --> 00:16:40.653
they are not deliberations. For example, our
breathing itself, is a living process within us

00:16:40.653 --> 00:16:46.532
worked out by Autonomous Nervous System.
Now, to understand our breathing, if you

00:16:46.532 --> 00:16:51.298
have to go to a library or to a University
or to a guru, how many will survive?

00:16:54.691 --> 00:17:07.971
So, it has to be the easiest, simplest, 
spontaneous and intelligible to everyone of us.

00:17:08.066 --> 00:17:11.936
You need not be a graduate [ASIDE - You
come this side please, if you don't mind.

00:17:11.936 --> 00:17:22.082
You can come - there's a room
there also.] You can not maneuvre

00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:31.138
or work out a living process.
It works by itself - sahaja.

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:38.297
Sahaja - 'Saha' means with, 'ja' 
means born. It is born with you.

00:17:39.072 --> 00:17:47.222
Yoga means union with the Divine. Now many
people think standing on your head is yoga;

00:17:49.058 --> 00:17:57.308
I think, it's a misnomer there. 
Yoga means yukti, means the joining.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.250
If standing on the head means yoga, means
you are joining your head with the Mother

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:15.589
Earth or something like that, it might
be. Joining of your attention with

00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:23.642
yourself, is yoga to begin with because
unless and until you know yourself,

00:18:23.642 --> 00:18:33.300
how are you going to know the rest of it.
So yoga means union with yourselves,

00:18:34.463 --> 00:18:45.293
which enables you to get united with the Divine,
with the All-Pervading Power of Divinity.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:53.200
To an intelligent man, it's all Greek and Latin,
I understand because you have never heard,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:02.044
perhaps, in your books about Divine.
Whatever is done, that is living,

00:19:02.044 --> 00:19:10.054
is done by this Divine Power and because
we are not yet Divine, we cannot do it,

00:19:10.054 --> 00:19:19.345
we cannot maneuver it but once we become
Divine, we can manoevre it, so now we have to

00:19:19.345 --> 00:19:32.175
become Divine through Sahaja yoga, means 
Sahaja is not, sort of a, custody of few people,

00:19:32.175 --> 00:19:41.074
it's for everyone because it is the right
of every human-being to become united with

00:19:41.074 --> 00:19:49.142
the Divine, to become Divine. Every human
being has this right to get this unity;

00:19:49.692 --> 00:19:58.097
That's what sahaja yoga means, that is
spontaneously works within every human being

00:19:58.097 --> 00:20:07.678
and you have to get to Divine. Now the 
problem may come later on with the word

00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:22.154
yoga is, that when you become Divine how
will you know about. Then the second

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:30.589
meaning of yoga means deftness - kaushalam
- deftness, is the nearest word for that

00:20:30.589 --> 00:20:38.474
is deftness. Deftness, how to handle the
Divine power. So far you have not handled it,

00:20:38.474 --> 00:20:44.777
you have not felt it, the All-Pervading Divine
Power but then when you have felt it,

00:20:44.777 --> 00:20:53.882
the second stage will be, how to maneuver
that Divine Power. So, Sahaja yoga goes

00:20:53.882 --> 00:21:01.830
into two stages. First is the spontaneous
awakening of your Kundalini, which is the

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.882
triangular, which is settled in the 
triangular bone, as I told you yesterday

00:21:06.882 --> 00:21:11.044
and I told you the names of the different
centers, which are subtle centers within us

00:21:12.217 --> 00:21:21.317
and secondly, to know how to handle this
power that now you start feeling as cool

00:21:21.317 --> 00:21:32.578
breeze of the Holy Ghost. This Kundalini
is a force, which is residual within us -

00:21:32.578 --> 00:21:38.917
meaning, when the whole being is created
and now as we are human-beings, this is still

00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:47.225
fully existing there. Our impure desires, 
that's why we do not get satisfied with them;

00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:52.855
We jump from one to another but this is
the purest desire that is within us

00:21:53.713 --> 00:22:01.823
and this desire has to be awakened within
us so that we become one with the Divine Power.

00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:09.137
As the Divine Power starts flowing within 
us, actually, we get connected with that

00:22:09.137 --> 00:22:16.908
source of Divine Power within us or as if 
we get connected as this instrument is

00:22:16.908 --> 00:22:25.781
connected to the mains. It is inexhaustible.
It flows, fills you up completely.

00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:32.499
As a result of that, you get rid of all 
your physical, mental, emotional problems

00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:43.488
most of them. All repairs take place. Cancer,
all diseases which are supposed to be incurable,

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:49.349
all kinds of incurable diseases can be
cured by Sahaja yog; You can cure them

00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:57.972
once you become Divine. We have cured, no
doubt. If you want to know, you can find out.

00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:10.797
So many people have been cured and once 
you get that light of Truth within you,

00:23:11.416 --> 00:23:17.266
you drop out all that is false, automatically
you drop out. I don't have to tell you,

00:23:17.266 --> 00:23:21.926
"Don't do that, don't do that," nothing -
no Ten Commandments before realization

00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:30.785
but after realization, you become a master
of yourself, just a master. All that is

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:38.905
falsehood falls off and that's what you
have to be. Once you are the Spirit,

00:23:38.905 --> 00:23:45.435
your Spirit is your master and the Spirit
starts guiding you. It sounds fantastic

00:23:46.393 --> 00:23:51.503
but if you look at a amoeba, he was thinking
what a fantastic thing the human beings are!

00:23:53.443 --> 00:23:59.983
And why this fantastic human being is
created after all, is to be known that

00:23:59.983 --> 00:24:09.203
fantastic thing that he is. But whatever is
unknown is not Divine that we must know.

00:24:10.057 --> 00:24:15.627
Many things are unknown to us because if 
they come into awareness, they cause problems.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:25.870
Our ears can hear only a particular type of
sounds but birds may hear something more

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:31.400
than us, which we have lost because for 
this human body it was not necessary

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.990
for us to know those things. So
many things we have lost

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:43.126
and so many we have gained just
to suit our this human being

00:24:43.346 --> 00:24:52.778
as it is and whatever we have to achieve, that
also we achieve in such a beautiful manner

00:24:54.117 --> 00:25:02.747
that all the problems that are existing within
us because of our ignorance, just vanish

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:10.917
like thin air. It's really magical but
whatever is unknown, is not Divine.

00:25:11.434 --> 00:25:19.084
Today I'm going to tell you about that part,
which is unknown to us and which part is Divine.

00:25:21.991 --> 00:25:28.911
Yesterday I told you, in short, about the
chakras, today I will tell you about the

00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:36.127
channels that we have within us. The channel
we have on the left side, as you see,

00:25:37.348 --> 00:25:43.898
is the channel, which is a subtle channel.
In the Sanskrit language it is called as the

00:25:43.898 --> 00:25:51.539
Ida Nadi or the Chandra Nadi or the, or the
channel of the moon. This manifests outside

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:56.561
the Left Sympathetic Nervous System. Now
in the Medical Science, they do not differentiate

00:25:56.561 --> 00:26:02.158
between the left and the right. I mean, they
haven't reached that state of subtle understanding

00:26:02.158 --> 00:26:07.681
so they are confused between the two. For
them left and right both are just the same

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:17.504
So the left side, which is the Ida Nadi,
is unknown to us, means, which is not in

00:26:17.504 --> 00:26:26.503
our awareness - we don't feel it - is the
past that we have, is the present past,

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:35.660
is the past past and is the past from where
we have come. All that is Collective past,

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:46.807
is beyond us, is unknown to us. Quite
recently I saw about a year back, a

00:26:46.807 --> 00:26:57.365
very good broadcast about the cause of Cancer.
Of course, they reach somewhere near there.

00:26:57.675 --> 00:27:08.325
They said that the vulnerability of cancer
exists in everyone and everybody builds in

00:27:08.325 --> 00:27:16.325
a cancer and dissolves it. We say that the
Sympathetic activity builds in cancer

00:27:16.573 --> 00:27:23.053
and the Parasympathetic neutralizes us,
according to Sahaja yog. But they also said

00:27:23.053 --> 00:27:35.733
one thing very notable that, the cancer is
caused by triggering, by, they called them

00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:41.187
Protein 58, Protein 52 - giving them some
names. You see, they don't know what to call it.

00:27:41.352 --> 00:27:50.332
By those entities, which can be called as Protein
52, Protein 58 - they enter into our being

00:27:50.332 --> 00:27:58.755
and trigger the cancer. Also they said, very
remarkably, that, "This attack comes to us

00:28:00.086 --> 00:28:08.446
from the area which is built within us 
since our creation." We call it as

00:28:08.446 --> 00:28:20.106
Collective Subconscious. They are very,
very near us. So, cancer is always caused

00:28:20.685 --> 00:28:31.135
by an attack which triggers this disease and
this attack comes to us from the left side

00:28:31.644 --> 00:28:42.184
called as the Collective Subconscious. So 
when we move too much to the left side,

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:51.040
we might get cancer but before that we
get experiences which we do not know.

00:28:52.752 --> 00:29:00.002
They are unknown but very dangerous.
Now what are the experience we get on the

00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:10.921
left hand side is, that first people start
seeing their past. They find their bodies

00:29:11.499 --> 00:29:20.289
are removed and they are flying somewhere
and they are left somewhere. Sometimes

00:29:20.289 --> 00:29:25.061
they start seeing things which they
have never seen before.

00:29:27.175 --> 00:29:33.805
They can gradually start feeling a
kind of numbness in their brain

00:29:35.177 --> 00:29:41.937
by which they cannot understand
many things. Their memory

00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:47.885
is very good but they find they are very
lethargic, they cannot get up to do work.

00:29:47.885 --> 00:29:55.139
They feel hopeless in life. The more they go
towards left - with so many things you can do it

00:29:55.139 --> 00:30:00.665
with certain types of drugs, you can
do it if you attend to some gurus,

00:30:01.165 --> 00:30:06.525
by following certain methods which
are left-sided. All the methods of

00:30:06.525 --> 00:30:12.346
mesmerism can take you down there,
all the Spiritualists and all that,

00:30:12.587 --> 00:30:18.977
even people who go to churches or into
temples, where people are mesmerized -

00:30:19.305 --> 00:30:24.925
even the temple people can mesmerize you.
In the church, if you are sitting on top

00:30:24.925 --> 00:30:31.380
of the dead bodies, you might be mesmerized
- anything that is dead can cause it.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:38.059
Say, you are living near a cemetry, in the 
night if you are going about after 12 0'clock

00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:44.204
somewhere, maybe in the night you can be
possessed and the result of that, ultimately

00:30:44.204 --> 00:30:49.764
becomes very obvious that people just get
possessed in the beginning. Once they are

00:30:49.764 --> 00:30:54.738
possessed, they start accepting that
possession and behave in a very strange

00:30:54.758 --> 00:31:00.798
manner for other people but they themselves
feel quite happy about it. It goes on moving

00:31:00.798 --> 00:31:07.549
towards the left more and more - people 
can get epilepsy, people can get diseases,

00:31:08.004 --> 00:31:13.904
which can be called as Schizophrenic or
any psychological problems which doctors

00:31:13.904 --> 00:31:21.304
cannot cure and the psychologists are also
trying to fumble at it because left side

00:31:21.304 --> 00:31:26.400
is the psyche, that's why I said, that Freud
was absolutely half-baked; He only knew about

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:35.392
the left side not about the right side. So, all
left-sided problems start coming to you.

00:31:35.392 --> 00:31:42.830
Recently I heard, about a disease called AIDS,
which has now gripping many people in America

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:49.121
and may grip people here - is also
another left-sided attack. Promiscuousness,

00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:54.551
all these things are left-sided, are emotional
things. You run after emotional things

00:31:54.551 --> 00:32:00.634
and you go into the unknown and you're hit
there in your ignorance and then you don't realize,

00:32:00.634 --> 00:32:10.672
why, we were seekers? Yes, you have been
seekers for ages, no doubt but you did not

00:32:11.032 --> 00:32:20.292
use your common sense, your wisdom, what
you were doing. All those gurus who teach you

00:32:20.292 --> 00:32:24.731
that sex can take you to God and all this
nonsense, can take you to the left.

00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:33.331
All these funny ideas that they
give you, can take you to left.

00:32:33.906 --> 00:32:39.426
Then the right-sided are also there, so
many people who can do that kind of a thing

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:46.926
So, this is one unknown area, I've described
to you, is the Collective Subconscious.

00:32:47.834 --> 00:32:53.721
On the right side is another channel,
called as the Pingla Nadi, is the Surya Nadi,

00:32:53.721 --> 00:33:01.976
is the channel of the Sun.

00:33:02.864 --> 00:33:10.214
This is the channel of your action, of 
your creativity, of your future. Now those

00:33:10.214 --> 00:33:15.829
who are futuristic people, those who live
in the future, plan in the future because

00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:24.574
future doesn't exist; What exists is the
present. The central path is of the present

00:33:25.281 --> 00:33:34.031
and the right sided one is that of the
future. So those who are futuristic people

00:33:34.472 --> 00:33:42.062
they can be very austere, they can be
without any emotions, you see, specially,

00:33:42.062 --> 00:33:48.322
say people nowadays, I find, are doing lot
of exercise, [UNCLEAR] even doing exercise

00:33:48.758 --> 00:33:56.748
They can just become like dried fish [UNCLEAR]
- not even a grain of emotion inside.

00:33:56.748 --> 00:34:01.877
So the one on left side, talk of love, "We
must have love and all that," the others,

00:34:01.877 --> 00:34:10.089
they say, "Disciplined, come along now like
military, wars, this, that," no compassion,

00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:17.099
no love - talk of love is nonsense -
there's nothing like emotions, forget it.

00:34:18.445 --> 00:34:25.755
So, the right-sided people become
extremely strong-headed, very futuristic.

00:34:27.885 --> 00:34:31.205
When they become futuristic, they can
even forget their names

00:34:31.205 --> 00:34:34.390
- to that extent they can go; Their
past miss even their names.

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:37.948
I've known one gentleman, who forgot
even the name of his wife and she was

00:34:37.948 --> 00:34:42.620
crying and crying, "Just see, he forgets
my name. Every time I tell him, he forgets

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.971
I've been married with him for
30 years and now, just imagine, he's

00:34:46.971 --> 00:34:50.949
forgetting my name. What a mess he's in!
He doesn't remember my name." He forgot

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:55.222
the name of his father, everyone but she
was very upset. She said, "The father is gone,

00:34:55.222 --> 00:35:00.009
he's now no more there to weep but I'm there to
face this thing that he doesn't even remember

00:35:00.009 --> 00:35:06.869
my name - he was that furturistic." He must
be remembering the name of his future wife

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:12.395
perhaps, the way he forgot. It is so
absurd a thing to be that futuristic

00:35:12.395 --> 00:35:19.359
because future doesn't exist but in the
presence if you, in the present you live

00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:29.202
then, you are with reality. Future
doesn't exist, the past is finished

00:35:29.678 --> 00:35:35.358
but if I tell you be in the present now,
to be, you cannot be - it's not possible.

00:35:35.435 --> 00:35:41.305
Either we are in the past or the future
and beyond the future is there is another

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:47.065
horrible realm that exists, which is 
called as the Collective Supraconscious.

00:35:49.354 --> 00:35:59.004
This Collective Supra Conscious was used
by Hitler and many leaders can use this.

00:35:59.004 --> 00:36:03.684
You see, they'll frighten you, they'll tell
you that, "This is going to happen," or maybe

00:36:03.734 --> 00:36:09.614
they might say that, "We are the highest
race," like Hitler said. And everything,

00:36:09.896 --> 00:36:16.416
you see, looks like that to people. So, 
the left-sided people are the people,

00:36:16.416 --> 00:36:22.134
we call as the ones, which are having a
big superego or the Pineal body acting

00:36:22.134 --> 00:36:29.994
and the right-sided are the people, who
have too much of ego with the Pitutary acting.

00:36:31.342 --> 00:36:36.202
Both are equally just the same. The one,
who are left-sided, torture themselves.

00:36:36.202 --> 00:36:42.799
They will starve, they'll put knives into 
their bodies, they'll put nails into their

00:36:43.379 --> 00:36:53.291
nose or pierce pins into their faces, color
their heads. It's very dangerous to color

00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:58.972
your head like that. I've known people
coming from that kind of thing - they're

00:36:58.972 --> 00:37:04.806
about to be blind; These pigments and
all that - one has to be very careful

00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:11.696
but when it happens to them, then they come
- doesn't matter, still one can work it out

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:17.798
but the right-sided people are the ones,
who torture others, who overpower others.

00:37:18.858 --> 00:37:23.458
They think they are the right. They'll
convince you that they're right and you

00:37:23.458 --> 00:37:32.826
will just be with them. They have a sharper
intelligence in a way which is not wisdom.

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:40.821
Because to have one person carrying the
whole load upon himself and taking all of

00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:48.578
them into Hell or into a situation that
Hitler created for the Germans today.

00:37:48.578 --> 00:37:55.691
No one trusts Germans and the Germans are
so apologetic, you see, all the time, if you

00:37:55.691 --> 00:38:01.067
have been to Germany, specially to East
Berlin, you'll be surprised. They're so

00:38:01.067 --> 00:38:05.566
apologetic. Oh, they say, "It was a 
political mistake, it was this mistake,"

00:38:05.566 --> 00:38:15.819
all the time they're so apologetic. So, a
person who is right-sided, can also create

00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:22.548
an aura, a kind of a big thing and people
can jump into that because it is unknown.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:28.721
It was not known to Germans, what it was
to feel, that they were a special race

00:38:28.721 --> 00:38:36.321
but do you know that Hitler used these
horrible Lamas to give him this power

00:38:36.321 --> 00:38:41.650
to absolutely entice these people.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.230
He tried all these tricks on them because
he learnt how to entice them;

00:38:53.938 --> 00:39:01.398
It's an established fact. So a person, if
he gets possessed by power, he can get

00:39:01.398 --> 00:39:09.856
you also possessed by it and you lose
complete control over your own understanding

00:39:11.627 --> 00:39:16.497
and no connection is there now with the
Whole - you don't think of the Whole.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:26.470
A man, who is ego-oriented, acts on his
own and starts destroying others and

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:33.880
making others also the same way as he is.
Now, this realm of ego is not known to you

00:39:35.307 --> 00:39:44.167
and that realm, if it comes on you, you will
not recognize it. It gives you another type

00:39:44.678 --> 00:39:52.928
of physical diseases also like, heart
disease. If a person has a heart trouble -

00:39:54.688 --> 00:40:00.028
there are two types of heart troubles, according
to Sahaja yoga - one is a lethargic heart

00:40:00.028 --> 00:40:04.376
another is an over-active heart and
the treatment is just the opposite,

00:40:04.422 --> 00:40:09.432
while in the Medical Science, it's only
heart trouble, whether it is angina or

00:40:09.432 --> 00:40:14.338
whether it's coarctation of aorta and
pulmonary vein or anything it is, just the

00:40:14.338 --> 00:40:20.040
same treatment they give to a patient.
There are two types of people - one who are

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.682
left-sided, one who are right-sided and
the third type of people, are the people

00:40:25.682 --> 00:40:33.971
who are in the center, who live in moderation
but in seeking you do move to the left and the right.

00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:40.671
In seeking you do move. If you are wise,
you keep in moderation in the center.

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:49.231
Tradition helps a lot, if you respect the
traditions. Not all the traditions are good

00:40:49.231 --> 00:40:56.551
but some traditions do come from the
Unconscious and the more you are prone

00:40:56.551 --> 00:41:00.346
to the Unconscious, the more
you are guided by it.

00:41:00.668 --> 00:41:05.368
Simple-hearted people, village
folk, who are not so complicated,

00:41:05.368 --> 00:41:11.519
who don't use their mental projections
so much, are very much near it,

00:41:12.327 --> 00:41:18.807
very much near. They know who is an
Incarnation, they know who is a Divine person,

00:41:18.807 --> 00:41:30.575
they know who is fake but people
who are complicated,

00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:34.819
find it difficult - there is a barrier

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:44.314
because they have lost that sensitivity,
because they have lost that feeling.

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:51.323
[HINDI - AAP LOG AISE BEECH MEIN SE
NAHIN JAANA CHAHIYE BAHUT BURI BAAT HAI.

[UNCLEAR]

00:42:05.758 --> 00:42:08.320
- [HINDI - AAPKO TAQLEEF HAI KOI?]
- [HINDI - JI HAAN]

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.999
- [ACHCHA]
- [BATAOONGI MAIN KAL]

00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:11.886
- [ACHCHA, THEEK HAI]
- I'm sorry

00:42:11.886 --> 00:42:16.238
[HINDI - ACHCHA THEEK HAI] She's not well,
she's saying, so that's why she can't sit longer.

00:42:17.759 --> 00:42:22.439
We can have some people tomorrow morning,
if you want. I can see them, if they're sick

00:42:22.975 --> 00:42:28.005
or in London, if they can come, I can see
them but just now, I'm just trying to

00:42:28.005 --> 00:42:33.763
create doctors out of you. You all become
doctors, so that you can treat yourself

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:43.580
and you can treat others - that's the best,
isn't it? So, My job is less. Now, with this

00:42:47.103 --> 00:42:56.493
that there is another awareness, which is here 
on top of our head, where we have to rise.

00:42:59.034 --> 00:43:05.684
While, we can call it the Super Consciousness -
I mean, there are no words in modern language

00:43:05.684 --> 00:43:14.605
but we can use super; Cambridge people would
say Supa - we can say Supa Consciousness here

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:24.455
and that consciousness, if the consciousness
we have to achieve and that's possible not

00:43:24.455 --> 00:43:30.664
through your mental projections or through
your education by anything but by the

00:43:30.664 --> 00:43:37.272
living process of Kundalini awakening,
which pierces through your fontanel bone.

00:43:39.828 --> 00:43:45.988
It removes all your, so called, artificial
identification, sophistication and all

00:43:45.988 --> 00:43:59.273
this nonsense and you become that pure
thing, your Spirit and that's what is this

00:43:59.273 --> 00:44:05.951
Super Consciousness, you have to achieve.
Then you become, again I will say, it is not

00:44:05.951 --> 00:44:12.971
just a brainwash - you become that and by
becoming, you get completely cured

00:44:13.341 --> 00:44:26.077
of all these misidentifications, of all these 
wrong ideas because you become the Absolute.

00:44:26.077 --> 00:44:34.281
There is no more relative world left for
you; You know this is the Truth because

00:44:34.281 --> 00:44:42.588
once that becomes, becomes your own,
becoming becomes your own. You start

00:44:42.588 --> 00:44:50.422
feeling a new sensation of cool vibrations,
of cool breeze in your hand. First time

00:44:50.422 --> 00:44:55.966
you feel that Divine Power flowing through
you and you feel the cool breeze coming

00:44:55.966 --> 00:45:01.233
out of your head. This nobody can do;
Can any human-being do like that

00:45:01.399 --> 00:45:07.159
to take out cool breeze? It starts coming
out of your head, you can see and it starts

00:45:07.159 --> 00:45:14.699
coming out of your hands. Then, the second
stage has to be achieved in which you have to know

00:45:16.027 --> 00:45:22.767
the kaushalam, the deftness how to handle
this Divine Power which you have achieved.

00:45:29.627 --> 00:45:42.270
This is a very vast subject because, so
far, whatever you have done, you have done

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:49.430
through your human awareness. Whether
you have accepted the knowledge of this tree

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:57.858
or the culture that we see or anything, also
that you have done through human awareness

00:45:58.529 --> 00:46:05.209
and whatever seeking you have done,
is also through your human awareness.

00:46:06.624 --> 00:46:12.884
You have to have the awareness of your
Spirit to go to the roots to understand

00:46:14.211 --> 00:46:19.111
the knowledge of the roots, the roots
that are nourishing this tree.

00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:27.309
Whole economics, politics, everything that you
have outside, has deep roots within yourself.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:31.910
Unless and until you understand those
deep roots, you will not understand the

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:36.549
oneness of the whole thing. An example 
I'll give you about politics now; There's

00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:43.362
a big problem between Communism and 
Capitalism; They're all one, perhaps,

00:46:43.362 --> 00:46:49.528
you do not know. I would say, I'm one of
the greatest Capitalist because I have

00:46:49.528 --> 00:46:56.447
so many powers within Myself but I'm the
greatest Communist because I must share them.

00:46:56.678 --> 00:47:04.668
I can't live without sharing it. Both 
things meet when you have real power

00:47:04.668 --> 00:47:08.988
then only you can have real sharing.
This is all artificial sharing.

00:47:13.394 --> 00:47:19.044
That's why we have to achieve our real
power and learn the joy of sharing.

00:47:19.618 --> 00:47:26.158
You automatically become a Communist, if
you are a real Capitalist

00:47:30.613 --> 00:47:35.573
and there is no problem and 
quarrel on that point.

00:47:36.612 --> 00:47:42.182
All knowledge of Economics is
superficial - why?

00:47:42.182 --> 00:47:54.834
because you talk about human-beings who
have desires or wants, as they call it;

00:47:54.834 --> 00:48:03.140
Want is the word. Wants which are satiable
in particular but not satiable in general.

00:48:05.224 --> 00:48:11.924
We talk of the want, which is satiable in
particular also in general.

00:48:14.376 --> 00:48:18.876
So the knowledge of Economics that you
have, is still on a shallow level.

00:48:18.928 --> 00:48:21.948
In the deeper level once you have this,

00:48:23.104 --> 00:48:27.334
then the satisfaction itself becomes
part and parcel of you.

00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:40.111
There is nothing to be desired anymore.
First, you are facing a person or someone

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:46.490
to desire something from that person or
from that position from that chair or maybe

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:54.871
from that food or maybe from that house.
Now, it's the other way round - you give it back.

00:48:56.657 --> 00:49:00.947
You take from the Nature morning till
evening - you're exhausting the Nature;

00:49:01.127 --> 00:49:10.609
Now you give it to the Nature. How? If
you now give these vibrations to a tree

00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:18.758
which is dying, it will survive. We have
experimented, in India, in an agricultural

00:49:18.758 --> 00:49:27.758
college, with many professors there, that
if you give vibrated water to the land

00:49:28.891 --> 00:49:36.501
or which is irrigated by vibrated water,
you get ten times more the yield and

00:49:36.501 --> 00:49:45.081
it's not like hybrid to taste - it's very 
nice to taste; The food is very nourishing

00:49:46.067 --> 00:49:52.117
They have tried with Indian cows. If you give
them vibrations, the vibrated water to drink,

00:49:52.129 --> 00:50:00.059
they produce milk. Supposing, they were
producing, say, 4 litres or say 5 litres,

00:50:01.658 --> 00:50:09.628
they start producing something like 20 litres.
Maybe, an Australian cow may produce 25 litres

00:50:10.254 --> 00:50:16.374
but they'll produce in between, say 20
litres but the milk of an Australian cow

00:50:16.375 --> 00:50:22.955
will make an Indian a vagabond. He'll be
very rude, he'll not respect anyone,

00:50:22.955 --> 00:50:28.592
he'll have no sense of respect - it's all
funny for us when the children start

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:34.234
taking that milk, you see. They hit you
back, they become boxers - all sorts of,

00:50:34.234 --> 00:50:40.368
you see, traits from Australia just crawl into
India, which are now we are not used to

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:46.000
but if you give this milk to an Australian
he becomes a sober person,

00:50:47.436 --> 00:50:51.646
he becomes a sweet person because
he comes in the center.

00:50:52.842 --> 00:50:59.762
And Indians, who are all the time
frightened, worried, upset about money,

00:51:00.641 --> 00:51:08.911
come in the center. So, it affects everyone.
To bringing left to the right, is not the way

00:51:08.911 --> 00:51:16.338
to improve but bringing left to the center
and right to the center and that's how,

00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:24.431
you give back to the Nature whatever you
have achieved from the Nature you have got

00:51:24.431 --> 00:51:33.378
from the Nature, you give it back and 
that's only possible, if you become the

00:51:33.378 --> 00:51:41.705
real Capitalist to give back. The whole thing
becomes [UNCLEAR], the whole priorities change.

00:51:41.705 --> 00:51:48.406
As I told you yesterday, that an egg becomes
a bird. Now imagine, the similarity left

00:51:48.406 --> 00:51:58.772
between an egg and a bird - just free to fly.
The first stage is, that you become a bird

00:51:58.772 --> 00:52:03.847
and the second stage is, you learn
how to fly and make others fly too.

00:52:06.404 --> 00:52:15.434
It is fantastic. To you it may appear to be
something very unusual but to Indians it is not.

00:52:15.434 --> 00:52:19.334
Those who are Indians; I mean, they are
Anglicized, Westernized, then I can't say,

00:52:19.334 --> 00:52:29.934
but those who know about this that we had 
since thousands of years this method of

00:52:29.934 --> 00:52:36.986
giving realization, was adopted. People were
given realization but very few, one or two.

00:52:37.816 --> 00:52:45.546
But today the time has come that thousands
of seekers are born and they have to be

00:52:45.546 --> 00:52:51.599
given realization and it has to work out 
enmasse; The time has come, that's why

00:52:51.599 --> 00:53:02.202
it is going to work out. So, I would
request you, that you should today ask

00:53:02.202 --> 00:53:09.000
for your realization and work it out and get
your realization. I'm here only for today,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:18.260
I'm sorry to say, in Brighton but I'm not
very far. These days I'm in London.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:26.337
Somehow, it was all organized that I had to
come to London and My husband got re-elected

00:53:26.337 --> 00:53:36.181
three times unanimously and I hope this
time he won't ask for another election

00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:43.624
because it's time for Me to go back to India
and work there but two and a half years

00:53:43.624 --> 00:53:47.697
are still there for this term, so I'm 
there for two and a half years and you

00:53:47.697 --> 00:53:54.253
need only, I think at the most, two and a half days to be an expert, if you want to.

00:53:55.472 --> 00:54:00.312
Some people got realization in Louis and
today they are giving realizations to others.

00:54:00.935 --> 00:54:08.575
Only day before yesterday they got their
realization, so you don't need too much time.

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:17.964
Have you any questions, please?
I'll answer.

00:54:21.813 --> 00:54:24.773
If you have any questions, please ask.

00:54:31.139 --> 00:54:33.339
Thank you!

00:54:43.323 --> 00:54:49.553
Seeker - They have been [UNCLEAR] when You
tell this to put our hand on our hearts

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:54.162
and then here, we had to do this
sixteen times and say

00:54:54.162 --> 00:54:59.181
- Yeah, yeah
- "I'm not guilty," and You said You will explain, alright

00:54:59.181 --> 00:55:01.325
- Yeah. Why sixteen times
- You didn't say, You didn't explain

00:55:01.325 --> 00:55:08.053
Yes, I'll tell you. It's very simple. In our book
you will know that all these centers have got

00:55:08.355 --> 00:55:14.995
a number of petals - we call them petals
and this is a very important center

00:55:14.995 --> 00:55:21.423
because by raising our head we have become
human beings. It has got sixteen petals

00:55:21.423 --> 00:55:30.653
and you'll be amazed that when in the
gross we see the cervical plexus, which is

00:55:30.653 --> 00:55:37.734
the gross manifestation of the subtle center,
that also had got sixteen sub-plexuses,

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:45.308
so we say it sixteen times that all the
petals could be treated. Actually,

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:50.111
eight times is sufficient for, if you are only 
suffering from the left side but I don't want

00:55:50.111 --> 00:55:55.125
to leave things to chances because the
way you people feel guilty, it is better

00:55:55.125 --> 00:56:00.329
you say it sixteen times - it's better - 
because it's a fashion these days to feel

00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:04.736
guilty. For what people feel guilty, I just
don't understand; Is only the Western people -

00:56:04.746 --> 00:56:09.156
I've never heard Indian feeling guilty. I've
never heard. If they are not Westernized,

00:56:09.156 --> 00:56:13.546
they don't know also why to feel guilty
- for what? We have not murdered anyone.

00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:27.579
And if you are guilty, then the courts will
find it out. Why should we criticize ourselves

00:56:27.596 --> 00:56:32.286
to be guilty or anything and you are not
in the presence, so why should you feel guilty -

00:56:32.286 --> 00:56:37.229
for what? If you had done anything wrong,
you would have been arrested long time back.

00:56:41.163 --> 00:56:50.263
But in the law of God there is something
called as forgiveness and as He is the

00:56:50.263 --> 00:56:54.938
Ocean of forgiveness, He dissolves all 
these little, little things that you have done

00:56:54.938 --> 00:56:59.638
- you are children. Human-beings have to
make mistakes - after all they are not God

00:57:02.076 --> 00:57:07.456
So what is there to curse yourself or to feel
bad about it? That's why I said sixteen times

00:57:07.456 --> 00:57:11.954
otherwise eight times punishment is 
alright but I said sixteen times because

00:57:11.954 --> 00:57:15.005
here the people do it in a very
big way, that's why.

00:57:22.798 --> 00:57:27.318
These are all different number of petals,
as you can see. The four for the first one

00:57:27.318 --> 00:57:35.519
six for the second, then ten for the central
one, then twelve for that one - the heart,

00:57:35.519 --> 00:57:43.371
the this one sixteen, this is two and then
thousand, thousand but we make it simple.

00:57:43.371 --> 00:57:47.982
There are seven centers in the Limbic area.
The seats of these seven centers is in the

00:57:47.982 --> 00:57:52.174
limbic area, so we just say seven times
for this.

00:58:03.392 --> 00:58:04.912
We should..... yes?

00:58:04.912 --> 00:58:10.219
Seeker - We have to get realization. I've
come here for realization [UNCLEAR]

00:58:11.225 --> 00:58:16.485
What does he say? Please repeat it.

00:58:16.485 --> 00:58:19.852
Seeker - I've come to get realization,
I haven't yet.

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:23.790
- He says coming here realization, Mother.
- Annh?

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:29.425
- May he have realization, please.
- That's the best. That's the best thing

00:58:29.425 --> 00:58:34.193
- that you've asked for. Yes!
- How do I get it?

00:58:34.193 --> 00:58:41.502
Yes, that's what I am just waiting to see.
That's great! That's a very good thing to say.

00:58:43.316 --> 00:58:51.686
Yes, you'll have it. Alright? It's very simple now.
Must believe that it has to be simple - one thing.

00:58:51.876 --> 00:58:55.963
That I've told you at length that it
has to be simple thing.

00:58:57.718 --> 00:59:04.138
Only thing, that All-Pervading Power is
here, everywhere but we cannot feel it.

00:59:04.138 --> 00:59:08.991
You see, like a radio can only catch the
ether in the same way it is.

00:59:08.991 --> 00:59:13.791
It's very simple. Now what you
have to do, is to put your feet

00:59:13.791 --> 00:59:18.743
on the Mother Earth. Why? Because
She helps us. She helps us a lot.

00:59:18.743 --> 00:59:22.305
Take out your shoes, will be better to
give you some connection with all these

00:59:22.305 --> 00:59:26.670
artificial things, I don't know, but still
let's start. So, better take out your shoes

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:30.305
it will help and also, when you take
out your shoes, there's a little

00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:34.475
relaxation to your feet, you see. Just
take out your shoes like that

00:59:34.475 --> 00:59:41.354
and put your both the feet straight like
that and your hands like this.

00:59:41.354 --> 00:59:48.095
Why don't you do it? It's very simple.
Yes, it's very simple. It helps

01:00:02.427 --> 01:00:08.437
Now, as I told you yesterday and
today again I tell you that these hands,

01:00:08.437 --> 01:00:13.842
here shown in a bigger way you can see,
these from the color you can see that

01:00:13.842 --> 01:00:21.582
these fingers are the manifestation of
the centers which are sleeping here.

01:00:23.131 --> 01:00:30.201
Now these are five, six and seven on the left
hand side and these are five, six and seven

01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:34.538
on the right hand side, so these centers
when joined like this, say, now this is

01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:39.929
the spinal cord. In the center you can
see here, is the spinal cord.

01:00:41.651 --> 01:00:46.091
So the left and right join and that's
how a center is formed.

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:53.170
Now these centers are represented
on your fingers.

01:00:53.321 --> 01:00:56.771
As I told you yesterday, Muhammad
Sahab has clearly said that,

01:00:56.771 --> 01:01:04.133
"At the time of resurrection your hands
will speak." He has talked more about the

01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:11.287
time of resurrection than the time of 
doomsday - really! But those who read

01:01:11.287 --> 01:01:15.932
Koran, never talk of resurrection - they
think they're already resurrected

01:01:18.189 --> 01:01:21.709
but they talk of the doomsday because
everybody should be frightened of the

01:01:21.709 --> 01:01:28.147
doomsday, you see, so they all cling to
these mullahs or to the priests or to the

01:01:28.286 --> 01:01:34.496
pundits and all these people but they don't
talk of the resurrection day, which is

01:01:34.496 --> 01:01:41.913
at length is so much vividly, clearly described.
Now, so these hands that you have,

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:47.373
you don't think much of them, perhaps but
they are very great. You have to just

01:01:47.373 --> 01:01:52.617
spread your hands, like this, in a very
simple way, put them on your lap and

01:01:52.617 --> 01:01:56.670
be comfortable - that's important. There
should be no nothing uncomfortable

01:01:56.670 --> 01:02:02.270
about it. Just put your hands, place
like this. Just place like this

01:02:05.229 --> 01:02:10.109
and close your eyes. Before closing your
eyes you can take out your spectacles

01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:18.833
because spectacles will little bit be
disturbing as the eyes also gets cured.

01:02:19.115 --> 01:02:25.785
Eyes also get vibrations so better to give
a greater chance to your eyes it's better

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:30.253
to remove your spectacles and close your
eyes; You don't have to open your eyes

01:02:30.253 --> 01:02:34.725
because when the Kundalini is rising like
that and She comes up to this center,

01:02:34.725 --> 01:02:42.292
that time if your eyes are not closed, She
may fall down and some of it may not even

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:46.875
rise at all. So some of you may not have
the awakening, so better is to take out

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:52.981
the spectacles also. If there's anything
tight here, you can little bit loosen.

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:57.111
I mean, if it is very tight but if it's
not very tight, it's alright, as long as

01:02:57.111 --> 01:03:04.296
you are comfortable. Here also sometimes
we have little tightness also you can loosen it.

01:03:04.742 --> 01:03:10.532
Now, you have come here to gain the
maximum advantage and so you have to

01:03:10.532 --> 01:03:15.065
co-operate a little bit with us. So just,
you take out your shoes, take out your

01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:21.826
spectacles, take out your, I mean, I 
also take out your tooths and nails

01:03:21.826 --> 01:03:27.372
and keep your eyes shut but if you don't
want to do it, no use being here, you see,

01:03:27.372 --> 01:03:30.676
just why to be here. Like, the other day,
two people came, they said,

01:03:30.676 --> 01:03:34.621
"We are observers, you see." I said,
"Are you international observers here?"

01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:40.300
Here you have come to be, so better get
something. What are you going to observe?

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.052
You are not even a realized soul,
what are you going to observe?

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:50.557
Do you think, [UNCLEAR], I think, that you 
have come to observe here? What will you observe?

01:03:50.795 --> 01:03:55.335
Everything is going to work out within
yourself. Why don't you guide yourself

01:03:55.360 --> 01:04:01.230
with this greatness? So please, try to
put your hands straight, close your eyes.

01:04:02.787 --> 01:04:08.597
Any observers, please, I will request you
to go away because it's a waste of time

01:04:08.597 --> 01:04:14.561
for us and for all. So why? If you have some free
time, you can go to some beautiful garden

01:04:14.561 --> 01:04:20.133
and enjoy yourself. Please close your eyes.
Just put your hands straight, just like that

01:04:21.146 --> 01:04:30.856
and nothing more to be done for the time
being. Don't fix your attention anywhere

01:04:30.856 --> 01:04:36.982
and don't worry if there are thoughts coming
in you. Just make your attention very loose,

01:04:36.982 --> 01:04:41.412
in the sense that you just don't worry about
what thoughts are coming; You just watch

01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:45.284
your thoughts, that's all and don't pay 
any attention to them. They're coming and

01:04:45.284 --> 01:04:54.740
going - that's all. Put your hands 
straight towards Me, on your lap with your

01:04:54.740 --> 01:05:00.089
fingers open towards Me - just like that,
straight - that's all, with your fingers

01:05:00.089 --> 01:05:02.840
little bent towards Me, that's all.

01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:19.002
Why don't you close your eyes?
Please close your eyes.

01:05:21.294 --> 01:05:23.924
There's no harm in closing your eyes.

01:05:24.732 --> 01:05:27.452
If you don't want to do it, it's
better you go away.

01:05:31.239 --> 01:05:38.469
Now as the left side is the desire power,
we have to keep it fixed - the desire;

01:05:38.645 --> 01:05:42.725
Desire to be one with the Divine
- left side.

01:05:42.725 --> 01:05:48.955
That is, the left hand is to be fixed as it
is, on your lap - as is as simple as that

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:59.480
and with the right hand we have to do
the action. Is very simple action is,

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:05.655
that you put your right hand on 
your heart, just on the heart.

01:06:07.339 --> 01:06:23.229
Now, in the heart resides the Spirit. At 
this stage, in your heart, you have to

01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:32.437
ask a question to Me, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" 
You are that but you better ask the question

01:06:32.437 --> 01:06:37.731
because still you are not sure, so you just
ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:06:37.731 --> 01:06:41.564
As an answer to that, the Spirit may be
awakened within.

01:06:42.683 --> 01:06:46.083
"Am I the Spirit? Am I the Atma?"
