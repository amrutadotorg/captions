Now, the knowledge of this is
the knowledge of the roots.

00:12.587 --> 00:16.536
Whatever we have achieved is
the knowledge of the tree.

00:16.680 --> 00:22.533
But if the tree outgrows itself
from its root, then it may die.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.342
So it is time that we should
find out about the roots.

00:28.740 --> 00:32.850
And to know about that, we
have to become a subtler being.

00:32.850 --> 00:36.000
At this human awareness, you cannot understand.

00:36.443 --> 00:39.120
But sometimes it challenges the ego of people.

00:39.120 --> 00:39.960
They think, "Why not?

00:39.960 --> 00:43.320
I am such and such, why shouldn’t
I know?" But you cannot.

00:43.320 --> 00:49.045
As you have to have a microscope to see things

00:52.080 --> 01:00.000
deeply, in the same way you have to have this
new awareness within you, this dynamic awareness.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.160
Of course, the nature of Self is
that it is collectively conscious,

01:07.140 --> 01:15.906
that it is the source of peace and
bliss, that it is the truth and love.

01:17.460 --> 01:18.540
That’s the nature.

01:18.540 --> 01:19.980
And you become that.

01:19.980 --> 01:20.946
You become.

01:21.360 --> 01:24.431
It’s not only mental, but you really become.

01:24.431 --> 01:27.028
Because whatever is mental is artificial
