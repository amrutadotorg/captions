00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.587
Now, the knowledge of this is&nbsp;
the knowledge of the roots.

00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:16.536
Whatever we have achieved is&nbsp;
the knowledge of the tree.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.533
But if the tree outgrows itself&nbsp;
from its root, then it may die.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.342
So it is time that we should&nbsp;
find out about the roots.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.850
And to know about that, we&nbsp;
have to become a subtler being.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.000
At this human awareness, you cannot understand.

00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.120
But sometimes it challenges the ego of people.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.960
They think, "Why not?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.320
I am such and such, why shouldn’t&nbsp;
I know?" But you cannot.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.045
As you have to have a microscope to see things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.080 --> 00:01:00.000
deeply, in the same way you have to have this&nbsp;
new awareness within you, this dynamic awareness.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.160
Of course, the nature of Self is&nbsp;
that it is collectively conscious,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.906
that it is the source of peace and&nbsp;
bliss, that it is the truth and love.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.540
That’s the nature.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.980
And you become that.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.946
You become.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.431
It’s not only mental, but you really become.

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:27.028
Because whatever is mental is artificial
