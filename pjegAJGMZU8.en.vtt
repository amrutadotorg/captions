00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.520
But this fear in man makes him think like that.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.080
He's afraid of this and afraid of that, and
then as a result, he loses his freedom.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.080
He becomes slave, slave to so many people he's afraid of

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.040
- that such and such man will harm
me, such and such man will trouble Me,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.480
and the whole concept of fear has ruined our family lives.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.120
For example, a wife is dominating, husband is dominating,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.480
there's nothing to fear, nothing to fear.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.240
By fear only you play into their hands.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.440
So supposing the wife is dominating, just make fun out of it.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.080
If you cannot make the fun in the
presence of, say, your wife or your husband,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.720
better make it outside.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.760
Take it, "Oh look at that."

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:12.120
It is your special quality now that you can
really get rid of your fear completely.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.560
What is there to be afraid of wife
or afraid of husband?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.600
What can he do to you?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.120
At the most he'll kill you, so what,
you are going to die in anyway.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.640
So the fear of death is another
nonsense people have.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.840
First time when I started My work everywhere
they asked Me, "What about death?"

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.040
I said, but just now you are living; why are
you asking, "What about death?"

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.480
So many people ask Me question,
"What about our death";

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.360
with why do you want to know about it?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.320
I'll tell you what about today, just now.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.440
So this is another mad idea - that we should
know about our death, what's going to happen,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.000
and whatever happens.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.840
Once you are dead you are finished.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
You don't have to do anything after that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.760
So what's the use of knowing when, when
you will die, what will happen to you?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.920
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.280
We never ask, that when I sleep
what will happen to me, do we?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.920
And this is a permanent sleep and we worry
so much about it that we should know what

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.040
will happen after death.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.160
One has to die at the time whenever it has to
die, because whatever is born has to be dead.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.760
But you do know that you have got eternal life.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.360
You can never die.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.400
Death is not this body disappearing;

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:54.960
death is where you are absolutely
without any control of your soul live.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.240
Once you are a realized soul you
have all the control, all the powers:

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.200
to take your soul wherever you feel like, to be born if you like;

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.040
if you don't want you will not be born,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:19.680
to be born with the people in the families,
in the communities wherever you like.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.160
There are many great souls I know that have
taken birth daringly into societies

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.720
which are very much, I should say, deteriorating
and are in danger of getting destroyed

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.720
because of stupidity they do.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:51.600
So this happening, that we are afraid of death,
is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.400
What is there to think even about your death?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.000
There is nothing like death for you
because you have got eternal life.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.000
It's not that you continue with the same
body. You may go on changing your dress

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.920
but you are living, you are aware, and
you know even if this body is not there

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.560
you will be there; all the time, available for Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.400
for anything that is to be done in the name of reality.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.440
So you must know your position as eternal being what is your work,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.520
what is your idea,
what you have to do.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:50.560
So one has to get rid of this idea of death
because death doesn't exist for you.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.920
It's finished.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:59.960
Moreover, all such people who are afraid of
their death go on having insurances,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.600
this, that, all headaches, see, and ultimately what happens?

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.000
All these worldly things you leave here and you depart.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.800
There is, I don't think anybody could carry even a little dust

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.640
with that soul which is departing.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.720
But in your case, when you people
are no more on this earth so called, then

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.600
you don't carry all this material things
because you have already given up.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.720
You have no interest in them.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.680
You're not materialistic so your spirit is free,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.920
and when you die what happens to you

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.280
is a very simple thing - that you feel
very liberated, absolutely.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.280
And then you feel your freedom completely,
and you can decide what you want to do.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.200
It's all under your own guidance, your own
desire; everything works out.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:17.160
You don't feel that you have come out of your
body, and this is what should tell you

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.600
that there should be no fear of death, but
on the contrary - it should be welcomed.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.680
Because you will feel much more liberated,
much more at ease.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.680
You don't have other problems that you have to in any case carry on

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800
in this world so because of this body.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.840
Now see I have to take some medicines, I have to take vitamins;

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.640
don't have to take anything, don't need it.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.400
This body's finished is a very good idea.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.440
They're so troublesome it is you see.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.600
All the time despite the fact that you may
say that, "Oh I don't care for this body,"

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.000
and all that, but this body won't leave you.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.960
This is the most sticky thing we have is our body.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.840
So to forget about death should be the easiest thing for you.
