1
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:05,710
I again see today some new faces

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,070
who have come here,

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,396
and I have to explain again today,

4
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:20,426
for the first time to them,

5
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:25,973
what is Sahaja Yoga,

6
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:30,954
which has been promised in various scriptures

7
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:37,226
that you have to get your Second Birth.

8
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,747
You have to be born again.

9
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:43,549
It is said. Christ has said too,

10
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,039
the same thing.

11
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,081
But people have not been able to ponder

12
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:59,151
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

13
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:03,393
Are we not already born as human beings?

14
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:06,673
We are born

15
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:09,135
but the human beings, which are born,

16
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:12,313
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

17
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:15,095
Now what are we going to do?

18
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:20,105
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

19
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:23,785
And are to be born again?"

20
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:30,851
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

21
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:36,861
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

22
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:39,372
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

23
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:42,794
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

24
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:48,994
which exists as all-pervading power.

25
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:54,448
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

26
00:01:54,451 --> 00:02:00,465
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

27
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,995
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

28
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:18,216
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

29
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:21,526
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

30
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:33,047
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

31
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:41,386
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

32
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:45,306
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

33
00:02:53,597 --> 00:02:59,038
This force, which is called as residual force,

34
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,818
is the desire of God,

35
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:13,256
which resides within us in a dormant way.

36
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:17,589
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

37
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:19,117
We have our own conclusions,

38
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,477
our own conceptions,

39
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:23,659
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

40
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,440
But you are not yet connected with God,

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,440
how can you do the work of God?

42
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,925
There is no way of really establishing

43
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:33,425
any actual rapport with God,

44
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,380
and how can you say that you are related to God

45
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,880
or you are doing the work of God?

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,538
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

47
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,448
He is managing you,

48
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:47,110
He has given you this life, is correct.

49
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,062
But there is no way of finding God

50
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,132
in your conscious mind.

51
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,618
It's just your mental activity

52
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:59,118
maybe your ego,

53
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:02,584
which says, "I am God."

54
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:06,906
Some people say, "I like it!"

55
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,408
But why do you like it?

56
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,516
Because I think, I like it.

57
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:15,386
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

58
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,056
It is not God’s,

59
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:26,786
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

60
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,026
that you are connected with God?

61
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:33,222
Then they will start discussing about it.

62
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,704
They sit down and talk about it

63
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:39,404
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

64
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:43,604
and he started it like a tape record

65
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:47,414
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

66
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:50,874
But your thinking is your own imagination.

67
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:53,361
There is no actual experience in it.

68
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,827
There is no actuality.

69
00:04:56,837 --> 00:05:00,767
I said, "This is fanaticism."

70
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:03,254
When you start thinking about something

71
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:07,845
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism,

72
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:08,855
of any kind.

73
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,667
You can be a football fanatic.

74
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:16,427
You think that a particular person must win.

75
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,927
It becomes sort of your thinking.

76
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,427
Then that person must win, if he does not win

77
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:24,877
then you are going to kill everybody else.

78
00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:26,997
If you go a little further with it,

79
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:35,899
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

80
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,709
Then whatever you think,

81
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,069
you feel that this is the thing

82
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,059
that is going to bring benevolence to people.

83
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,149
but what is the proof?

84
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:50,863
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

85
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,089
All your thinking

86
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:58,749
is based either on your conditioning,

87
00:05:58,739 --> 00:05:59,869
whatever you have read,

88
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,720
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

89
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,470
will be Christian thinking means church's

90
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,959
thinking not God's thinking.

91
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:09,440
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

92
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,940
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

93
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,440
or somebody who has taught you something.

94
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,161
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,700
anything is possible!

96
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,250
Are we going in the same direction

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,131
with our thinking?

98
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:29,121
Or are we related to God?

99
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,111
First, relationship with God must be established.

100
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,611
That is extremely important

101
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,111
before we talk of God

102
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:40,874
because all our thinking is our conditioning

103
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:44,793
or else our imagination.

104
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,123
There are some people who met Me

105
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,243
they said they have met God.

106
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:50,743
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

107
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,803
"Oh, I met him on the street."

108
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:53,853
I said, "Very good."

109
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:56,353
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

110
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:58,853
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

111
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:03,098
But what is the proof?

112
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:05,593
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

113
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,848
Then gold has a density.

114
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,098
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

115
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,348
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

116
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:18,601
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

117
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,781
In the same way our faith,

118
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:24,901
because we think we have a belief in it,

119
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:27,961
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

120
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:30,186
as far as anybody else is concerned.

121
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,701
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

122
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,876
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

123
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,596
I can tell you this much.

124
00:07:36,596 --> 00:07:37,556
And this is the reason

125
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,616
another mythical stuff is coming up

126
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:41,096
is that there is no God.

127
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:45,066
This is another myth.

128
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:47,572
Either to believe that you are connected with God

129
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:50,072
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

130
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:51,756
Because if you have not met Him

131
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,572
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

132
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:57,302
may not be – is a better situation.

133
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:59,808
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

134
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:02,308
is another myth.

135
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,808
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

136
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:08,995
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

137
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,745
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to

138
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,485
give up our comforts.

139
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:14,615
As just now, I was telling someone

140
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:18,465
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

141
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,447
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

142
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,947
It’s quite comfortable.

143
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:27,815
And a little bit of a sand comes in

144
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:36,771
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

145
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:41,601
So, oyster takes out his saliva

146
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,371
goes round it, makes it softer,

147
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:47,301
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

148
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:49,117
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

149
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,557
very satisfied, it’s all right.

150
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,537
The shell is the thing for me."

151
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,041
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

152
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,917
avoiding understanding

153
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:04,037
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

154
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:08,247
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

155
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,761
If you have a house, very nice!

156
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,726
I’ve got children, very nice!

157
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:15,211
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

158
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:19,836
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

159
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:28,045
But then, certain calamities come in.

160
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,265
You are faced with them.

161
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,495
Problems come in

162
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:38,967
and then you think,

163
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:41,471
"I never waited for this.

164
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,987
It was most unexpected."

165
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,568
There are another set of people,

166
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:54,618
who think – who ‘think’, again!

167
00:09:54,627 --> 00:10:02,587
that they have to search God.

168
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:09,078
And that’s how they jump into sea.

169
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,248
They jump into fire,

170
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:12,218
they jump into water,

171
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:14,118
they jump into all kinds of things

172
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:19,309
without understanding what danger it entails.

173
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,769
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

174
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,989
an oyster and another is an oyster

175
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,809
which is burnt up

176
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:33,776
which is either drowned or something.

177
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:40,126
So what should a human being do?

178
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:44,666
He should be comfortable,

179
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,896
but all the time he should think that

180
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:51,176
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

181
00:10:51,176 --> 00:10:53,635
I have to watch and see,

182
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:57,425
I have to understand."

183
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,925
Oyster in the shell

184
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,829
is better sometimes

185
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:09,699
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

186
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:12,199
But the oyster in the shell

187
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,699
will die its own death.

188
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,654
But there is a possibility about the oyster

189
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:20,154
which has come out that he might meet

190
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:23,104
something.

191
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,517
Because he is a seeker

192
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:29,937
God also looks after him,

193
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,007
God also wants to help.

194
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,447
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

195
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,517
he could work it out.

196
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:46,442
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

197
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:48,682
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

198
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:51,187
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

199
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:53,797
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

200
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:58,427
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

201
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,727
It is within you!

202
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:11,033
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

203
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,533
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

204
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,709
from the flower,

205
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:21,553
in the same way it is all built in you.

206
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:26,857
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

207
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:29,997
your own thinking

208
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:36,587
and your desiring, it resides.

209
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:42,477
You desire something

210
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:45,877
and you don’t think about it

211
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:48,953
that is the best way you can do.

212
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:51,453
We have two capacities within us,

213
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:56,000
one is to desire. With this left side,

214
00:12:56,014 --> 00:13:02,560
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

215
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,720
the desire.

216
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,680
It manifests outside

217
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:17,254
as left sympathetic nervous system,

218
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:21,994
which is our emotional side,

219
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:27,154
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

220
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:29,387
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

221
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,364
This is the psyche about which

222
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,843
the psychologists are worried.

223
00:13:35,844 --> 00:13:39,033
So, we desire.

224
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:43,493
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

225
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:47,523
represents the power by which we maintain

226
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:50,016
our physical being

227
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:55,970
and ultimately we start thinking.

228
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:59,920
Between these two resides

229
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,430
the power of our evolution.

230
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,456
So we have left side and right side

231
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,286
sympathetic nervous system,

232
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,790
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

233
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,586
is the parasympathetic.

234
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,636
Parasympathetic is a system

235
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,130
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

236
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,873
How much we have achieved so far up to

237
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:23,753
human level.

238
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:26,276
Only human beings think that

239
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:32,792
they have to achieve God, not animals.

240
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,811
They have reached that state that they think

241
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,315
that they have to achieve God,

242
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,955
they desire that they have to achieve God.

243
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:46,017
There is a gap between their achievement

244
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,957
and there is the desire.

245
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:53,063
This is to be crossed.

246
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:58,983
But their desire cannot work it out,

247
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:03,303
only their desire can call for the help from God,

248
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,803
and the God’s desire is within you

249
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:10,423
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

250
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:15,783
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

251
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:18,293
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

252
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:23,406
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

253
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:25,416
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

254
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,734
has to give you the Second Birth.

255
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,848
This is the Holy Ghost

256
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,364
about which Christ could not talk

257
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:36,958
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

258
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:41,638
They were mad that they thought that Christ

259
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:47,030
was blasphemous.

260
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,570
Just think of it!

261
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,660
And today we have churches and people,

262
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,160
and this and that.

263
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,290
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

264
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,480
nobody recognised Him

265
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,430
When He came, they talked of Moses,

266
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,820
Abraham.

267
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,320
It is very nice to handle Christ,

268
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,550
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

269
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,050
to face reality.

270
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,550
Because if they had recognised Christ

271
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,222
then Christ would have said, "All right

272
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:22,299
if you are recognising Me, then get your

273
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:27,329
Realisation

274
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,726
and understand yourself.”

275
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,746
They where not prepared for this.

276
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,976
Only twelve people somehow – you see

277
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:36,462
managed to be there, somehow.

278
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:42,912
They would not accept Him either.

279
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,982
Till He was resurrected

280
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:51,082
then they accepted Him, in a way.

281
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,752
And then, what are you going to do

282
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,412
but to create a myth around it.

283
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,980
And to say that, “Of course,

284
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,210
we believed in Christ.”

285
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:02,426
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

286
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:05,656
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

287
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:08,606
you did not face.

288
00:17:08,596 --> 00:17:12,346
And now you live in imaginary world,

289
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:15,096
you have your own paradise about it.

290
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:17,826
Where does He live within us?

291
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:23,812
Has He created any position within us?

292
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,612
Is there any meaning to His life,

293
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,012
which has left a permanent mark within us

294
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,512
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

295
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:37,482
If so – where does He reside within us?

296
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,440
How can we be connected to him?

297
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:42,790
Nobody made any exploration about it.

298
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:46,166
Again the comfortable shell started.

299
00:17:46,163 --> 00:17:48,066
It has happened not once,

300
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,236
thousands of years it has been happening,

301
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,486
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

302
00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:57,066
that’s how they behaved.

303
00:17:57,073 --> 00:18:00,403
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

304
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:01,873
when Krishna came they said,

305
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:04,153
"We believe in Rama."

306
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:08,773
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

307
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,269
But you better now recognise

308
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:15,859
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

309
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,879
the time has come.

310
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,860
How long are you going to live with your myths?

311
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,329
The time has come.

312
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:31,829
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

313
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,344
Most amazing is that in the West,

314
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:38,705
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

315
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:41,425
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

316
00:18:41,415 --> 00:18:43,265
her son is a Realised Soul.

317
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:45,765
They said their teacher was very anxious

318
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:48,185
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

319
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:50,685
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

320
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:54,035
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

321
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,535
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

322
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:01,400
was Christ born in England or in America?

323
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,180
His cross is even, you can find it

324
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:14,144
on the airport of London.

325
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,868
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

326
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,738
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

327
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:24,646
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

328
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:27,866
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

329
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,336
or to English or to anyone.

330
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,405
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

331
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:39,376
it is your right to know.

332
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:43,686
All of you have got Kundalini.

333
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:46,186
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

334
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:48,697
you can see its rising.

335
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,174
You can see its piercing through,

336
00:19:51,174 --> 00:19:52,906
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

337
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:56,271
You can see the piercing.

338
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,881
You can see, when it pierces through,

339
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:01,201
how you become actually collectively conscious.

340
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:06,001
You do become.

341
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:11,063
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

342
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:13,554
And why should you avoid?

343
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:17,144
Because reality is so beautiful,

344
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,444
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

345
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,944
which is so beautiful.

346
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:25,454
There was a gentleman in Paris

347
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,954
who got his Realisation and two days he was

348
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,253
just laughing out of joy and he said,

349
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,273
“I’ve never laughed all my life

350
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,413
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

351
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:36,913
he was laughing;

352
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,773
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

353
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,603
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

354
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:44,328
Actually he told me that he never believed

355
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,358
in God, to begin with.

356
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:49,353
He thought he was a very rational being.

357
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:55,683
I said, rational beings are still half,

358
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,725
because they are dealing with something

359
00:20:57,725 --> 00:21:01,520
so limited, is rationality.

360
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:09,050
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

361
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:11,575
and something is already within you,

362
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:14,075
God has placed within you because it is his

363
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:17,419
desire that you should know Him,

364
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,685
that His power should flow through you

365
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:23,315
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

366
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,585
that He is your generous Father and He's

367
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:31,150
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

368
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:35,359
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

369
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:42,829
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

370
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,099
It is such a remarkable thing

371
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:51,759
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

372
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:55,549
that you have to get an experience of God,

373
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,468
you have to feel Him within yourself.

374
00:21:59,495 --> 00:22:06,418
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

375
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:09,518
Because if religion gets organised

376
00:22:09,518 --> 00:22:13,391
you also get beliefs organised.

377
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:17,058
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

378
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:21,976
blind leading the blind.

379
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:28,506
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

380
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:32,056
He will organise.

381
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:35,706
You cannot conceive Him.

382
00:22:35,726 --> 00:22:39,006
He has to conceive you.

383
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:42,156
His Grace must come on you.

384
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:46,476
You have to ask for his Grace.

385
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:50,496
He has already placed His desire within you.

386
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:55,486
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

387
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:59,877
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

388
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,854
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

389
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,674
which are shown, to Me,

390
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:05,844
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

391
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:08,334
and you start jumping and you start making

392
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,649
noises and things like that.

393
00:23:11,634 --> 00:23:14,134
At the very outset, I must tell you

394
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:18,104
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

395
00:23:18,124 --> 00:23:23,908
And this Mother is your own Mother

396
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:26,194
You do not have

397
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:28,224
any other Mother but this Mother

398
00:23:28,224 --> 00:23:32,728
and She does not have any child but you.

399
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,364
Do you think such a Mother

400
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:37,484
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

401
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:41,494
would be in any way troublesome to you?

402
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:47,164
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

403
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:53,007
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

404
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:58,414
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

405
00:23:58,414 --> 00:23:59,772
I mean you can talk of anything

406
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:03,162
if you want to befool people.

407
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:06,407
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

408
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:09,617
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

409
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:14,386
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

410
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:17,877
So many mythical things have been written

411
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:21,397
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

412
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:25,817
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

413
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:32,377
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

414
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:34,886
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

415
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:40,446
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

416
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:47,967
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

417
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:51,407
Christ never went to any theological college.

418
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,467
It cannot be done by any such person

419
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,877
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

420
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:05,397
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

421
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:08,817
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

422
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:11,303
Can you?

423
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:15,227
You have done nothing living by reading.

424
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:22,548
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

425
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:32,955
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

426
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:40,974
We go and read something,

427
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:47,414
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

428
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:52,906
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

429
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:56,743
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

430
00:25:56,763 --> 00:26:00,983
All your arguments, everything is dead.

431
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:05,127
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

432
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:07,047
That’s the Mantra.

433
00:26:07,063 --> 00:26:11,397
The word that is living is the Mantra.

434
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:16,681
These holy words,

435
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:19,201
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

436
00:26:19,201 --> 00:26:21,471
has no meaning at all.

437
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:24,841
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

438
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:28,071
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

439
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:30,551
and he can address to God

440
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,051
like you get connected.

441
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:41,196
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

442
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:43,705
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

443
00:26:43,705 --> 00:26:46,205
very fanatically involved into it,

444
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:48,047
it doesn’t matter.

445
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,457
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

446
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,677
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

447
00:26:53,687 --> 00:26:55,757
in the past, finished.

448
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:58,257
We have to get our Realisation.

449
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:00,757
We have to actualise ourselves.

450
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,142
This is the main point.

451
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:04,012
We are seeking ourselves.

452
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:05,912
Unless and until you realise yourself

453
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:09,002
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

454
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,502
but you should not deny Me.

455
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:19,237
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

456
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:24,916
because blind people cannot get it.

457
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,070
But you should not be also closed

458
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:32,760
because closed people also cannot get it.

459
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:36,539
When you get it then you must believe,

460
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:38,696
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

461
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:41,606
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

462
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:49,225
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

463
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:53,465
that is faith, pure faith.

464
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:57,545
But in English we have to use an adjective

465
00:27:57,585 --> 00:27:59,925
that blind faith and faith.

466
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:02,277
But people are so confused that they forget

467
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:03,847
the adjective of blind,

468
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:06,477
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

469
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:11,951
one has to accept it.

470
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:16,047
But your faith should be such that it is based

471
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:22,335
on the truth.

472
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:28,295
Then you become an enlightened person.

473
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:31,158
After all God has made us into human beings,

474
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:33,168
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

475
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:35,668
We have done nothing about it.

476
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:40,971
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

477
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:42,125
It’s His job

478
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:46,255
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

479
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:49,595
It is His job!

480
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:58,098
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

481
00:28:58,121 --> 00:29:00,621
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

482
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:09,771
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

483
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:14,101
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

484
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:18,621
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

485
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:23,111
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

486
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:30,679
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

487
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:35,131
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

488
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:39,741
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

489
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,561
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

490
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:50,970
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

491
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:55,157
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

492
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:59,067
And then you jump into your Realisation,

493
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:03,457
but still the state is not established.

494
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:11,222
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

495
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:17,224
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

496
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:21,654
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

497
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:27,984
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

498
00:30:27,964 --> 00:30:32,550
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

499
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:39,417
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

500
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:46,747
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

501
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:55,238
You can say a seed becoming a fruit

502
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,741
and maturing,

503
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,833
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

504
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:04,863
and then the fruit maturing.

505
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:08,057
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

506
00:31:08,057 --> 00:31:10,557
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

507
00:31:10,557 --> 00:31:13,737
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

508
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,117
But people who are not complicated so much,

509
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:19,327
uncomplicated people, simple people,

510
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:22,267
PART OF SHRI MATAJI'S TALK IS MISSING

511
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,758
chakras are alright,  or not you start verifying it

512
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,538
through your brain.

513
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:29,378
You go round and round and round.

514
00:31:29,406 --> 00:31:32,878
That's why the first thing you get is...

515
00:31:32,886 --> 00:31:38,371
your attention gets enlightened.

516
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:42,911
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

517
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:48,311
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

518
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:54,541
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

519
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,538
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

520
00:31:59,548 --> 00:32:04,857
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

521
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:09,365
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

522
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:14,625
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

523
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:17,119
the physical and the mental problem.

524
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,712
If a person is egoistical,

525
00:32:19,717 --> 00:32:24,910
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

526
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:30,715
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

527
00:32:30,725 --> 00:32:34,505
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

528
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:37,003
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

529
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:39,275
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

530
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:41,260
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

531
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:45,710
This centre is that of Christ.

532
00:32:45,706 --> 00:32:48,206
Even many people who call themselves Christians

533
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:52,210
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

534
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:56,150
One because they are unauthorised

535
00:32:56,146 --> 00:33:00,228
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

536
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:04,858
Both ways it is just the same.

537
00:33:04,872 --> 00:33:10,288
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them, you should feel

538
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:15,438
them, you should know them.

539
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:24,498
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

540
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:31,912
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

541
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:34,892
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

542
00:33:34,904 --> 00:33:40,494
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

543
00:33:40,489 --> 00:33:44,879
means the vital power of life.

544
00:33:44,864 --> 00:33:48,819
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

545
00:33:48,825 --> 00:33:51,325
Now this Prana Shakti,

546
00:33:51,335 --> 00:33:56,556
which is on the right-hand side...

547
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,041
What's happened?

548
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,690
There's some noise somewhere.

549
00:34:05,555 --> 00:34:08,446
The Prana Shakti within us

550
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:13,236
comes to us through five elements.

551
00:34:13,232 --> 00:34:20,466
The five elements are, as you know,

552
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:25,156
is, one of them is the earth,

553
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:27,176
then we have got the water,

554
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:30,981
then we have got the air,

555
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,500
then we have got the light

556
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:36,028
and then we have got the ether.

557
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:38,528
These five elements are there.

558
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:44,070
Out of these five elements our body is made.

559
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:54,410
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

560
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:00,710
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

561
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:05,430
because these machines are

562
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:14,800
able to detect only the right side

563
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,800
as they deal with matter.

564
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:27,685
The whole of the matter is created by these five
energies and they have also a casual energy behind

565
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:32,572
it. And these casual energies actually make that.

566
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:38,986
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

567
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:44,432
From the fragrance earth is created.

568
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:46,939
Now, within us all these five centres

569
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:53,873
that you see

570
00:35:53,885 --> 00:36:01,963
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

571
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:05,206
The body of those centres are made of

572
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:09,378
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

573
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:18,768
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

574
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:22,968
Because they were born of a particular element,

575
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:35,733
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

576
00:36:35,748 --> 00:36:38,813
which dealt with that particular element.

577
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:46,841
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

578
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:53,351
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

579
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:56,396
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

580
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:59,986
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

581
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:02,276
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

582
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:06,576
the whole world as such, within us.

583
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:15,666
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

584
00:37:15,646 --> 00:37:22,012
were born out of water element.

585
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:28,796
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

586
00:37:28,806 --> 00:37:36,563
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

587
00:37:36,574 --> 00:37:38,803
one after another,

588
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:43,070
we can say Abraham, Moses,

589
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:49,780
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

590
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:52,750
and so many others like that

591
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:55,244
Nanaka

592
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:59,753
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

593
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:03,990
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

594
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,583
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

595
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:11,098
being responsible or being born out of that

596
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:25,259
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

597
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:29,969
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

598
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:35,122
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

599
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:42,904
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

600
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:49,835
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

601
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:52,354
What a human being should be like,

602
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:56,128
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

603
00:38:56,118 --> 00:38:59,718
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

604
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:06,008
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

605
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:11,887
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

606
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,382
They are against fanaticism.

607
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:22,315
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

608
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:28,779
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the blood of human beings

609
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:30,929
you will be amazed how

610
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,315
the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen are over time

611
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:38,395
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

612
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:41,094
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

613
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:43,594
which sorts out all your poisons.

614
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:47,270
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

615
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:51,849
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

616
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:55,340
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

617
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:01,079
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

618
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:04,309
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

619
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:08,002
You can do whatever you like.

620
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:12,032
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

621
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:16,972
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

622
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:21,299
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

623
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,629
You have not created yourself.

624
00:40:23,643 --> 00:40:26,979
God has created you with such difficulties.

625
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:31,189
He has taken you out of

626
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:34,779
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

627
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:40,599
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

628
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,209
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

629
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:48,469
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

630
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:54,209
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

631
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:57,519
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

632
00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:03,289
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

633
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:06,569
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

634
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:12,602
You become malignant. You become cancerous

635
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:15,079
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

636
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:21,388
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

637
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:24,228
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

638
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:28,998
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

639
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:31,268
you become separated from the whole.

640
00:41:31,263 --> 00:41:34,413
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

641
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:39,753
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

642
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:44,179
actually who are you? You are made by God.

643
00:41:44,189 --> 00:41:46,689
You are His own child.

644
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,992
Still you are a child.

645
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:53,762
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

646
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:58,110
You have not known the whole so far.

647
00:41:58,112 --> 00:42:01,360
How can you say that?

648
00:42:01,372 --> 00:42:04,870
You have to grow!

649
00:42:04,882 --> 00:42:08,237
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

650
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,739
absolute.

651
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:18,167
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

652
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:22,007
you are fighting your own sustenance.

653
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:30,293
And this sustenance was completely supported

654
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:38,603
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

655
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:42,437
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

656
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:48,072
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

657
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:51,792
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

658
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:53,692
People said that He drank wine

659
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:57,102
but wine means grape juice in that country,

660
00:42:57,102 --> 00:42:59,602
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

661
00:43:02,632 --> 00:43:06,042
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

662
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:08,202
which is fermented,

663
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:10,152
which will go against your awareness?

664
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:12,385
Just think of it!

665
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:15,485
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

666
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:17,685
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

667
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,208
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

668
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:25,241
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

669
00:43:25,218 --> 00:43:29,731
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

670
00:43:29,731 --> 00:43:32,231
is a fact.

671
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:37,971
But He wants to do something else

672
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:43,907
because He came as Divine Power itself.

673
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:46,488
He was the embodiment of Pranava

674
00:43:46,488 --> 00:43:51,998
not Prana – all powers put together.

675
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:57,488
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

676
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,748
That’s why He came to prove

677
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:03,220
what Krishna has said,

678
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,460
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

679
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:08,880
It cannot be blown off,

680
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:12,200
it cannot be destroyed.

681
00:44:12,193 --> 00:44:15,453
His body was made out of that,

682
00:44:15,473 --> 00:44:20,953
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

683
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:26,912
All these things are knowledgeable

684
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:28,483
only if you are a realised soul,

685
00:44:28,483 --> 00:44:32,103
otherwise you cannot understand this.

686
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:35,413
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

687
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:37,103
of your own understanding,

688
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:40,413
you are still children as I say,

689
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:43,369
you have to be born again,

690
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:50,799
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

691
00:44:50,782 --> 00:44:54,669
You have to ask just a question,

692
00:44:54,669 --> 00:45:03,519
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

693
00:45:03,508 --> 00:45:06,544
or the OM, or the Brahma?

694
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:11,123
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

695
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:15,733
You will get the cool breeze.

696
00:45:15,733 --> 00:45:21,063
and that is the sign that He was.

697
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:28,375
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

698
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:33,153
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

699
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:37,005
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

700
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,763
which is knowledge itself

701
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,999
and then everything trickles down

702
00:45:43,995 --> 00:45:49,146
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

703
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:55,476
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

704
00:45:55,496 --> 00:46:02,976
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

705
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:08,856
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

706
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:12,916
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

707
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:21,250
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

708
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:28,025
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

709
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:31,216
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

710
00:46:34,045 --> 00:46:38,855
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

711
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,035
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

712
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,690
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

713
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:56,630
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

714
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:01,919
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

715
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:06,310
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

716
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:08,850
on the Agnya Chakra

717
00:47:08,854 --> 00:47:11,010
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

718
00:47:11,014 --> 00:47:14,717
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

719
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:20,910
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

720
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,480
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

721
00:47:29,144 --> 00:47:34,251
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

722
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:41,471
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

723
00:47:42,784 --> 00:47:49,621
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

724
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:57,938
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

725
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:08,017
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

726
00:48:13,328 --> 00:48:19,389
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

727
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:25,529
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

728
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:29,569
That's important.

729
00:48:34,524 --> 00:48:42,210
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

730
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:48,953
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

731
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:54,409
All such people should leave.

732
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:58,634
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

733
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:00,732
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

734
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:05,522
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

735
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:10,280
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
