1
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:59,907
Please be seated.

2
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:35,935
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

3
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:42,539
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

4
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:08,396
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

5
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:21,397
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

6
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:32,301
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

7
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:36,277
of the Mother and Christ.

8
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:56,922
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

9
00:04:57,123 --> 00:05:03,488
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

10
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,080
And when they could not explain it,

11
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:22,040
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

12
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:35,204
Even before Christ, they used to have

13
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:39,788
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

14
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:46,979
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

15
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:08,740
to worship what they call Yahovah.

16
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:20,728
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

17
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:33,552
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

18
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:40,305
She incarnated before also.

19
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:46,923
She incarnated as Sita,

20
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:54,422
and then She incarnated as Radha,

21
00:06:54,741 --> 00:07:00,049
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

22
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:05,337
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

23
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:10,663
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

24
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:24,606
He was the son of Radha.

25
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,890
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

26
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:42,666
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

27
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,149
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

28
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:59,405
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

29
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:13,053
All the description about Jesus Christ

30
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:20,769
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

31
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:37,283
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

32
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,896
with immaculate conception,

33
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:46,190
which She had done before also, as Radha.

34
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:12,751
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

35
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:25,808
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

36
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:38,975
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

37
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:45,088
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

38
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:58,212
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

39
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:14,041
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

40
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:29,546
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

41
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:34,571
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

42
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:40,989
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

43
00:10:55,846 --> 00:11:03,339
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

44
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:19,244
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

45
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:32,718
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

46
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:42,148
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

47
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,448
because He is just vibrations.

48
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:59,087
So when you do puja to Me,

49
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:05,612
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

50
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:20,204
If they had done puja to Christ -

51
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:28,118
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

52
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:42,530
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

53
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:51,954
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

54
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:07,675
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

55
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:22,905
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

56
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:36,324
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

57
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:46,038
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

58
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:51,490
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

59
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:59,269
which is the swayambhu,

60
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:03,925
is created by the Mother Earth.

61
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:11,385
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

62
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:24,281
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

63
00:14:32,577 --> 00:14:41,146
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

64
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:51,769
So I went to see that place

65
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:59,546
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

66
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:04,243
about say, five inches, at the most.

67
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:15,206
And the face was just like Mine,

68
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:20,314
exactly like Mine.

69
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:27,544
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

70
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:36,333
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

71
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,874
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

72
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:56,854
and they started following under a rock,

73
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:08,365
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

74
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:14,394
And in that light they walked,

75
00:16:14,595 --> 00:16:17,780
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

76
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:23,954
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

77
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:42,863
So they worship that statue in that place.

78
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:52,508
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

79
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,467
as I give you vibrations,

80
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:04,060
but not so much

81
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,628
as I give you.

82
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:11,846
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

83
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:15,986
who might be giving you vibrations.

84
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:23,620
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

85
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:27,377
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

86
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:32,025
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

87
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,534
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

88
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:50,412
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

89
00:17:58,423 --> 00:18:05,523
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

90
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,590
and there are many sweet water wells there.

91
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:22,325
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

92
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:26,100
many people took photograph.

93
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:36,166
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

94
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,527
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

95
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:53,520
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

96
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:59,324
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

97
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:17,773
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

98
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:22,938
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

99
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,825
Same is the puja.

100
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:43,523
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

101
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:54,933
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

102
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:08,319
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

103
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:18,911
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

104
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:28,020
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

105
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:43,856
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

106
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:51,515
what powers He gives you.

107
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:54,331
When you praise those qualities,

108
00:20:54,532 --> 00:21:01,408
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

109
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:15,875
This is how the Divine works,

110
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:22,740
as if you get charged with those qualities.

111
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:33,051
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

112
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:44,555
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

113
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:53,349
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

114
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,648
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

115
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,362
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

116
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:09,921
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

117
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:14,492
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

118
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:35,515
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

119
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,806
It could not happen earlier,

120
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:59,548
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

121
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:11,505
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

122
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:14,667
that I look like you, I behave like you,

123
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:16,754
I have made Myself exactly like you -

124
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:21,071
very difficult to make, but I have.

125
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,431
And this body has to bear lots of things

126
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:56,369
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

127
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:10,495
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

128
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:14,474
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

129
00:24:14,675 --> 00:24:18,711
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

130
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:24,239
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

131
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,879
and moving very fast.

132
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:44,728
Now I have to bear it.

133
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:50,038
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

134
00:24:56,824 --> 00:25:02,663
Because He is very direct,

135
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:11,560
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

136
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:23,913
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

137
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:32,168
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

138
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:50,683
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

139
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:55,390
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

140
00:25:55,606 --> 00:26:00,041
so I take time to take them out.

141
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,137
So all these things are very symbolic,

142
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:23,350
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

143
00:26:28,928 --> 00:26:34,361
And that symbol actually acts.

144
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,637
For example if you give somebody a flower,

145
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:45,644
 that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

146
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:50,298
and gratitude comes in.

147
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,117
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

148
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:12,610
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

149
00:27:25,015 --> 00:27:29,495
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

150
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:32,708
and of their blessings on you.

151
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:37,715
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

152
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:50,546
That is how the Divine acts.

153
00:27:53,773 --> 00:28:02,606
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

154
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:09,954
Now we are doing puja at this time,

155
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:14,234
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

156
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:21,778
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

157
00:28:36,432 --> 00:28:40,280
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

158
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:43,175
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

159
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:48,448
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

160
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:51,658
Now they are getting the same blessings,

161
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,605
though you are doing the puja

162
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:58,585
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

163
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:24,446
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

164
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:28,030
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

165
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:32,554
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

166
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:37,699
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

167
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:59,991
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

168
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:05,784
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

169
00:30:14,747 --> 00:30:17,986
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

170
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:23,700
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

171
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:42,648
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

172
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:52,937
So you should be very relaxed about it.

173
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,991
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

174
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:04,067
May God bless you all.

175
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:12,400
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

176
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:15,526
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

177
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:18,971
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

178
00:31:19,172 --> 00:31:21,104
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

179
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:24,693
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

180
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:29,976
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

181
00:31:33,236 --> 00:31:35,012
The children have to wash the Feet

182
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:39,730
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.

183
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,193
Yogi: Yes. In Spanish, Mother?
Shri Mataji: In Spanish.

184
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:45,531
Yogi Yes.
Yogi 2: OK. Pujari?

185
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:48,500
Shri Mataji: Now see the description
of Shri Ganesha

186
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,375
which was written thousands of years back.

187
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:56,633
It’s translated and exactly the same
of that of Christ.

188
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:03,922
We have little added to it about Christ
in the end, but it’s the same.

189
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:20,101
First the boys must wash and the girls
must paint.

190
00:32:20,302 --> 00:32:23,260
Yogi: OK.

191
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:28,753
Shri Mataji: So she – they are unmarried
girls.

192
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:35,601
Unmarried women and unmarried girls
should do it, paint.

193
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:39,436
First let them wash. First let the boys
wash –

194
00:32:39,637 --> 00:32:42,504
just tell, first let the boys wash,

195
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:48,319
and then the unmarried women, unmarried
girls should paint,

196
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,381
and then the married women should give
the ornaments.

197
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:53,492
Now, can you bring it from the… Warren:
She is going to help with the washing,

198
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:55,840
for children to wash.
Shri Mataji: All right.

199
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,982
So now, can you get the ornaments also?

200
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:23,778
So first of all you get the water together,

201
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:27,984
now this one [container of water from Feet]
is to be brought here.

202
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:36,056
Yes. Can I have this kumkum?

203
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:40,194
Swastika should be made on that. Swastika
should be made.

204
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:44,328
Then other things also, My necklaces-
and all that.

205
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:49,629
No, no, the bangles are – and necklaces
I gave you

206
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:58,675
Yes.

207
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:11,979
Just correct, correct, correct. It’s
the other way round it is. Yes.

208
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,545
No, it’s not that.

209
00:34:18,748 --> 00:34:22,984
Once this is made, just take it to go
through.

210
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:31,366
Yogini: Excuse me.
Shri Mataji: You take a cloth.

211
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,579
And bangles are there?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

212
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,887
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, it goes like that.

213
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,751
Just if you can wipe it, it’s all right.

214
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:55,359
You can just yes, wipe it, I’ll tell you.

215
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:12,536
All right.

216
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:34,568
This was the correct swastika. And
the other way is the Hitler’s swastika.

217
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:38,227
Can I have the towel? I’ll have the towel.

218
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,207
[Warren: “Yes”.
Yogi: “It’s the same, Mother”

219
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:47,210
Warren (aside): “Did she respect the form?”.
Yogi: “It is the same”.]

220
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:48,946
You may keep it in a plate.

221
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:53,845
Warren: Yes, I’m just going to get it,
Mother, I’ll get another plate.

222
00:35:54,046 --> 00:35:56,725
Shri Mataji: And the bangles?
Warren: Yes.

223
00:35:56,926 --> 00:36:01,349
Shri Mataji: Just give Me that, Albert.

224
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:09,385
What is it, are you giving these bangles?
Warren: Done the same that the…

225
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:12,432
Shri Mataji: What’s it?
Warren: Yes, done the same

226
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,597
that the swastika is the same, is the one
that was used by Hitler,

227
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:18,220
he just turned it on the side.
Shri Mataji: No, no.

228
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:22,557
You see, what happened in the beginning
he was using the other way round.

229
00:36:22,758 --> 00:36:25,911
Then what happened, they used – that’s
your Mother’s trick –

230
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:28,842
they used the stencil in the other way
round,

231
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:34,903
so the thing, swastika, turned round and
they lost. You don’t know this?

232
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:39,788
To begin with, they started an upside-down
thing, you see, the other one,

233
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,349
to begin with. They started using the other
way.

234
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,576
But then the stencil was used in the other
way round. You see?

235
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:52,772
You know, the whole thing turned and
they kept to this.

236
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:57,867
That’s how they lost. You don’t know this?

237
00:36:58,068 --> 00:37:03,607
Yogi: No. Shri Mataji: Just tell her, this
is the trick I’ve played.

238
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:06,419
[Yogi: “They’d made the stencil the wrong
way”]

239
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,702
You see, the other way, they used
the stencil.

240
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:11,081
[Yogi: “Yes. And so it came out this way”]

241
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:14,091
You see, first they started using
the stencil on one side,

242
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:19,183
and then they started using it the other
side, and that’s how they lost.

243
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:22,392
Yogi: And it came out this way.
Shri Mataji: No,no, if you make a stencil

244
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:27,881
like this, you see, first the other way
round it was, you see,

245
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:31,505
and then if you turn it the other way
round, then you come this way,

246
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:33,715
it came this way. Yogi: Yes. It was on
the flags at the start this way, Mother.

247
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,104
Shri Mataji: No, this is the second
swastika.

248
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:41,435
The first swastika was the other way round.

249
00:37:42,531 --> 00:37:45,289
That’s how they got it.

250
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:50,507
They used the stencils, you see, to make
the swastika first.

251
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,479
So first one was the other way round.

252
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,014
But then the stencils were spoiled or maybe
whatever it is, so they turned it round.

253
00:37:57,215 --> 00:38:02,535
When they turned it round this swastika
started coming, they didn’t know.

254
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:11,848
One stands for destruction, another stands
for construction.

255
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,730
Explain to them, so they’ll understand.
All right.

256
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:38,778
You follow the point?
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”]

257
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:42,463
That’s how they lost.

258
00:39:05,316 --> 00:39:10,441
They took their advice to begin with from
the lamas,

259
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,525
and lamas told them to use the swastika
the other way round.

260
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:19,666
But then the mistake was that they drew
for them,

261
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:23,669
and then they turned the stencil, they
didn’t realize

262
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,931
that they have turned the stencil, so it is
coming the other way round.

263
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,657
They were their gurus.

264
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:46,522
So it’s all right, doesn’t matter, as long
as we know how to do it, that’s all.

265
00:39:46,723 --> 00:39:49,974
Nothing to worry.

266
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:57,713
Yogi: It’s time to wash Your feet now,
Mother?

267
00:39:57,914 --> 00:40:02,187
Shri Mataji: Now you have to wash My feet,
the children have to.

268
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:07,001
(Aside to a Sahaja Yogini: “Be careful”).

269
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,876
Just to pour water, that’s all.

270
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,985
Next time also remember

271
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:41,433
we’ll have to give them the pots for this,
for washing My Feet, all right?

272
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:48,152
For them. Warren? They haven’t got them.
Yogi: Yes, Mother, I’ve noted that.

273
00:40:49,907 --> 00:40:54,016
Shri Mataji: Rub it with both the hands.

274
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:59,096
All right, this and this. Yes.

275
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:06,895
Two persons can do at a time, two of you
would be [better].

276
00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:10,071
Will be better. Two, two, ha. Now you
two do it.

277
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:15,160
With both the hands. With both the hands.

278
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:19,113
Tell them to do it with both the hands.

279
00:41:22,257 --> 00:41:25,405
Use this hand also.

280

Agni is fire.

302
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:26,704
Javier: … Vayu… Shri Mataji: Vayu is air.
All the five elements,

303
00:47:26,905 --> 00:47:30,208
this means all the five elements.

304
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:36,681
Vayu means air, but with the Agni, Vayu…

305
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:43,431
Javier: Indra, Vayu… Tu eres el sol,
the sun and the moon.

306
00:48:27,629 --> 00:48:34,409
Shri Mataji: One minute. You come along –
those who are not yet married ladies.

307
00:48:37,243 --> 00:48:40,671
And the boys can go back.

308
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:59,276
Come. All unmarried?

309
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,383
Put a little water. All right.

310
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:18,649
More water,

311
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:48,631
little more water. Little.

312
00:52:49,294 --> 00:52:52,136
You take out the…

313
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:37,754
Be careful.

314
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,885
May God bless you.

315
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:14,374
Now. If we start the… [Yogi: “108 names
of the Devi?”] –

316
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:20,808
Eh? We can just start the Devi stotra

317
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:23,847
is all right, because they have started
with the Devi.

318
00:55:24,048 --> 00:55:26,874
Yogi: The 108 names or…

319
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:42,283
Shri Mataji: This side also. Here.

320
00:55:53,727 --> 00:55:59,468
Only now - married women have to come
after this.

321
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:17,346
Just you say one name, you say: “Shri
Mata”, then you say the translation.

322
00:56:30,699 --> 00:56:32,067
Now you must verify,

323
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:35,914
you see, these are the qualities they are
describing of your Mother.

324
00:56:36,115 --> 00:56:41,299
Now you try to, try to verify it also.

325
00:56:43,143 --> 00:56:48,266
And these names were written also thousands
of years back.

326
00:56:53,305 --> 00:56:59,506
These are thousand names, we have chosen
only 108.

327
01:03:32,487 --> 01:03:36,911
Again, again.

328
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:08,632
Yogi: Nishkàla. Javier: (translates into
Spanish) Indivisible, completa.

329
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:12,652
Shri Mataji: Nìsh-kalà (She corrects
the accents). Yogi: Nìsh-kalà.

330
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:26,876
Shri Mataji: (To one of the ladies)
Complete.

331
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:37,445
Full. Complete toe.

332
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:41,023
Now. The married ladies now.

333
01:05:43,101 --> 01:05:47,858
Now the married ladies come in – then you
can start it.

334
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:33,140
Bangles, did you take bangles?

335
01:07:00,331 --> 01:07:04,499
There are no bangles as such. Sorry.
It’s all right.

336
01:07:24,021 --> 01:07:30,121
Doesn’t matter. Good. All right. Give it
away.

337
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:17,567
Yes, yes, now. Yes, yes. Yes. Good.

338
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:35,532
Yogi: Nirmama.
Javier: No es egoista.

339
01:08:35,733 --> 01:08:42,870
Shri Mataji: Nirdwanda. Nirdwanda.
Yogi: Nirdwanda.

340
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:08,678
Shri Mataji: Mirror you [can have]. Mirror.

341
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:12,140
Mirror you can have.

342
01:10:25,363 --> 01:10:28,363
Family.
[Yogini: “Yes”]

343
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,195
(To the young boy bringing the Mangala
Sutra) Hold it.

344
01:11:23,003 --> 01:11:26,816
He’s very nice. It’s correct, now, it’s
correct, that’s right.

345
01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:31,994
Should be in this way.

346
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:37,315
Thank you.

347
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:21,125
(Aside to the lady who is putting the
anklet) Other way round, other way.

348
01:13:49,882 --> 01:13:54,764
Warren? They are missing here all
the (toe rings)

349
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:02,266
for other toes. All they were there
in France.

350
01:14:02,467 --> 01:14:05,025
Warren: They were in France, Mother, but
they went back to London…

351
01:14:05,226 --> 01:14:08,225
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. It’s all right,
let’s see.

352
01:14:08,426 --> 01:14:12,125
We’ll have to get separate ones for them.
For every…

353
01:14:12,326 --> 01:14:15,000
(Warren: “For some reason they held them
separately in the…”)

354
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,614
All right, then it’s all right.

355
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:25,154
Yes. You’ll give it. That’s right.

356
01:15:04,443 --> 01:15:10,709
Yogi: The sari. Javier: Sari.
Yogini: Sari… Yogi: I gave it.

357
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:23,176
Shri Mataji: Just keep it. Just keep it.

358
01:15:30,956 --> 01:15:33,895
Towel.

359
01:15:43,391 --> 01:15:50,609
Now. I’ll take water. Water to drink.
Water.

360
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,330
That’s all. That’s all.

361
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:02,877
Hold it. Hold it.

362
01:17:18,165 --> 01:17:23,374
Honey. Now honey.

363
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:19,228
It’s all right.

364
01:20:44,885 --> 01:20:50,642
Sugar, sugar.

365
01:20:52,829 --> 01:20:56,203
Sugar.

366
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:19,474
Water.

367
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:38,144
Sugar, sugar.

368
01:21:38,345 --> 01:21:41,648
Sugar, sugar.

369
01:21:58,176 --> 01:22:01,272
Water, water.

370
01:22:15,559 --> 01:22:20,164
Saffron, saffron is there.

371
01:22:46,815 --> 01:22:50,086
Some water.

372
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:49,275
Now. Clean one…

373
01:24:15,337 --> 01:24:19,162
Scent. Scent.

374
01:24:41,902 --> 01:24:45,285
Scent. On the swastikas.

375
01:25:43,754 --> 01:25:46,581
Yes, yes. Attar.

376
01:25:54,042 --> 01:25:55,536
They’ll have… good.

377
01:25:55,737 --> 01:26:03,086
(To a girl) Please put it to all of them
like this. Yes.

378
01:26:18,249 --> 01:26:19,680
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: On the wrist.

379
01:26:19,881 --> 01:26:21,514
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

380
01:26:21,715 --> 01:26:24,922
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: To all of them.

381
01:26:28,839 --> 01:26:30,857
I told her to put to all of them
the Chandan gandha.

382
01:26:31,058 --> 01:26:33,757
Did she understand that?
[Yogi: “Yes”]

383
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:41,749
Now. Ah, with flowers.

384
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:11,153
Sari, sari. So…

385
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:24,095
Warren? Warren?

386
01:27:24,296 --> 01:27:27,022
There’s no blouse with it?

387
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:31,103
Half, half, put it half way.

388
01:27:31,327 --> 01:27:34,774
[Yogi: “There is a blouse”]
There’s a blouse, where is it?

389
01:27:52,984 --> 01:27:57,670
Maricruz, Maricruz.

390
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:25,763
There, good… Leave it there. Yes, good,
leave it there. Tell her to leave it.

391
01:28:33,901 --> 01:28:42,658
Now. Every lady has to take a fruit and
the rice - hello?

392
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:47,574
Every lady has to take a fruit in the hand,
and -

393
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:52,674
a fruit in the hand and some rice and put
it here.

394
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:57,274
See, I’ll take it a little. Where is
the cloth?

395
01:28:57,977 --> 01:29:01,937
There’s a cloth there. That’s it.

396
01:29:09,091 --> 01:29:13,381
Now you tell them. To catch one fruit
in the hand.

397
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:16,725
Yogi: Before the sari, Mother?
Shri Mataji: No, sari is all right.

398
01:29:16,926 --> 01:29:21,597
Keep it like that. Now fruit is there.
Now, take the fruit.

399
01:29:21,798 --> 01:29:26,409
You see, will be confusion, that’s why
to say one by one.

400
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:30,492
 Keep it. Keep it.
[Yogi: “After the sari”]

401
01:29:31,314 --> 01:29:34,711
See, take the akshata (rice).

402
01:29:44,772 --> 01:29:50,333
Yes. Now you hold it. You hold the sari.
Hold it.

403
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:58,000
Like that. Yes. Yes, take one side.

404
01:30:56,666 --> 01:31:00,675
Yes, she has all…

405
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:12,290
All right, now.

406
01:31:13,205 --> 01:31:20,597
If this you can remove, then we can go
ahead, well, with flowers.

407
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,931
Just remove these, one by one.

408
01:31:25,137 --> 01:31:29,968
It’s dangerous. Just remove those
(candles)…

409
01:31:58,021 --> 01:32:01,178
You better have the sari now.

410
01:32:01,379 --> 01:32:04,769
But they have got something for the hands?

411
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:10,147
Flowers for the hands, they have any?

412
01:32:10,348 --> 01:32:12,962
No? Just flowers, ask them,

413
01:32:13,163 --> 01:32:17,878
otherwise they might be disappointed,
if they have made.

414
01:32:23,086 --> 01:32:25,372
Garland?
[Yogi: “There is a big garland”]

415
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,995
All right. Now. You put this.

416
01:32:32,063 --> 01:32:35,438
The other way round. Yes.

417
01:33:04,096 --> 01:33:12,959
Put the flowers around… And some garland.

418
01:33:33,581 --> 01:33:39,364
Yes. Exactly, when you have finished.

419
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,386
Yes. Now the garland has to be put.
Oh, you got that?

420
01:33:45,587 --> 01:33:50,007
Yes, that’s what I’ve asked. That’s
beautiful.

421
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:56,919
So I’ll wear the garland first and then
the… All right.

422
01:34:59,179 --> 01:35:02,141
(The crown) tie it up more.

423
01:35:06,988 --> 01:35:11,602
Tighter, still. Now, still tighter.

424
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:29,978
Should be tighter as it is. It’s all right?

425
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:33,608
Now I’ll have.

426
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:55,670
Some photographs, if some people want
to take?

427
01:35:58,317 --> 01:36:02,796
Cloth there, in the corner.

428
01:36:27,196 --> 01:36:30,244
Make it neat, so the whole thing comes out,

429
01:36:30,445 --> 01:36:33,193
and now you can put the lights and
everything,

430
01:36:33,394 --> 01:36:36,202
so you get a full picture of the puja –

431
01:36:36,403 --> 01:36:41,000
remove that towel and make…

432
01:40:41,324 --> 01:40:43,577
Shri Mataji: Now, can you little bit do
it neat

433
01:40:43,778 --> 01:40:46,968
and then we’ll have the Aarti.

434
01:40:53,018 --> 01:40:56,549
What is there?
[Prasad is offered to Shri Mataji]

435
01:42:10,146 --> 01:42:13,582
Sahaja Yogi 1: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi 2: Aarti.

436
01:50:17,267 --> 01:50:22,188
Yogi: Bolo Shri Bhagavati Mataji

437
01:50:22,389 --> 01:50:28,750
Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

438
01:50:58,268 --> 01:51:02,198
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.
May God bless you all.

439
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:05,487
May God bless you all.

440
01:51:07,052 --> 01:51:09,770
May God bless you.

441
01:51:11,011 --> 01:51:15,698
It’s very good, everybody has very good
Kundalini.

442
01:51:15,921 --> 01:51:18,811
May God bless you.

443
01:51:24,898 --> 01:51:27,829
That’s good.

444
01:51:53,293 --> 01:51:56,396
May God bless you.

445
01:52:00,548 --> 01:52:06,433
Except for Vishuddhi, all other chakras are
all right –

446
01:52:08,622 --> 01:52:10,472
for which you have to say Allah Hu Akbar.

447
01:52:10,673 --> 01:52:15,235
Say it now, sixteen times.
Yogi: Sixteen times.

448
01:52:17,047 --> 01:52:21,058
Warren: We should stand. Shri Mataji:
Sixteen times, to open the Vishuddhi.

449
01:53:23,644 --> 01:53:27,018
All right.

450
01:53:40,883 --> 01:53:43,392
Good.

451
01:53:45,087 --> 01:53:49,314
Give yourselves a bandhan. One.

452
01:53:49,536 --> 01:53:52,118
Slowly.

453
01:53:53,816 --> 01:53:56,249
Two.

454
01:53:57,250 --> 01:54:00,940
Three.

455
01:54:01,284 --> 01:54:04,120
Four.

456
01:54:04,422 --> 01:54:07,593
Five.

457
01:54:07,807 --> 01:54:11,759
Six. And seven.

458
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,173
Now raise your Kundalini.

459
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:22,656
Tie it up. One. Again.

460
01:54:24,487 --> 01:54:29,184
Tie it up. Again.

461
01:54:29,385 --> 01:54:34,656
Now tie it up three times. Fix it up on top
of your heads.

462
01:54:34,856 --> 01:54:41,697
One – two – three.

463
01:54:41,898 --> 01:54:46,471
Very clear, today it’s very clear.

464
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:49,382
Ah!

465
01:54:50,665 --> 01:54:53,523
Can you see?

466
01:54:55,534 --> 01:54:58,240
Feeling?

467
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:04,558
All right. May God bless you.

468
01:55:14,181 --> 01:55:18,144
Warren, I can wash My Feet in the room
or not?

469
01:55:22,579 --> 01:55:26,612
You have to take out these things here.
(Warren: “The ladies”.)

470
01:55:28,195 --> 01:55:32,101
Or we can go in the room and take it out.

471
01:55:32,302 --> 01:55:36,716
It’s all right. (Yogi: “All right”)
… Yes.

472
01:55:46,637 --> 01:55:49,388
Warren: It’s vibrations on the gold.

473
01:55:49,589 --> 01:55:52,573
Shri Mataji: Ah!

474
01:55:53,745 --> 01:55:57,901
This was - are they given by the English,
I think.

475
01:55:58,102 --> 01:56:01,323
All right, yes. [Warren: “Yes”]

476
01:56:12,968 --> 01:56:15,999
Take it closer first, then it will become
good.

477
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:20,032
Bring it closer (not clearly audible)…
Warren: Take it closer.

478
01:56:26,713 --> 01:56:30,098
Other Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have some
presents.

479
01:56:30,299 --> 01:56:33,886
Shri Mataji: Presents? Oh, have you?
Sahaja Yogi: Can I bring?

480
01:56:34,087 --> 01:56:37,060
Shri Mataji: All right.

481
01:56:39,494 --> 01:56:43,566
But not too many, you have given Me
those presents today.

482
01:57:01,167 --> 01:57:05,541
Warren? This also goes... now, thank you.

483
01:57:07,124 --> 01:57:10,405
While this is, this one is Mine, and this
one is –

484
01:57:10,606 --> 01:57:15,194
or you can keep it in your bag (necklace).

485
01:57:20,900 --> 01:57:23,741
[Yogi: “Can I help, Mother?”]

486
01:58:01,675 --> 01:58:04,526
This one also (bracelet).

487
01:58:20,847 --> 01:58:26,557
It’s all right. Please, be seated.

488
01:58:30,641 --> 01:58:32,690
Yogi: This is the collective present from
Spanish people, Shri Mataji.

489
01:58:32,891 --> 01:58:34,101
Shri Mataji: From where?
Sahaja Yogi: Collective present.

490
01:58:34,301 --> 01:58:36,558
Shri Mataji From Spanish?
[Yogi: “Yes”.]

491
01:58:36,759 --> 01:58:39,450
Thank you very much.

492
01:58:40,081 --> 01:58:42,003
[Yogi: “May I help You, Shri Mataji?”.]
Beautiful rose you have made.

493
01:58:42,204 --> 01:58:45,766
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, yes, decoration.

494
01:58:46,490 --> 01:58:48,470
May I help You, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Yes, I am not very good

495
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:54,952
at it, thank you. Only I can open
Kundalini.

496
01:59:30,658 --> 01:59:36,413
It’s beautiful, this is Toledo work, yes!

497
01:59:39,603 --> 01:59:45,972
Beautiful, beautiful.

498
01:59:46,173 --> 01:59:47,858
Chakras is,

499
01:59:48,059 --> 02:00:00,035
this is the what you call the birds flying,
like the Holy Ghost.

500
02:00:00,236 --> 02:00:04,340
Thank you very much, very beautiful,
very beautiful.

501
02:00:04,541 --> 02:00:08,982
You must write it down here from
Spanish people.

502
02:00:09,183 --> 02:00:11,228
And date, because you know, so many
presents,

503
02:00:11,429 --> 02:00:15,750
and they’ll be all going in the personal
archives.

504
02:00:21,975 --> 02:00:27,604
Yes, so. So the progeny can see what
you people have given the Mother.

505
02:00:37,307 --> 02:00:40,300
Oh, thank you very much.

506
02:00:52,118 --> 02:00:55,482
So their engagement is now announced

507
02:00:55,683 --> 02:01:02,194
and they’ll be getting married in
Ganapatipule, both of them. Fernando …

508
02:01:31,121 --> 02:01:33,953
May God bless you.

509
02:01:48,994 --> 02:01:51,758
Take this.

510
02:01:58,617 --> 02:02:01,927
I’ve tried to (open the package).

511
02:02:25,595 --> 02:02:33,745
Oh beautiful, it’s very beautiful.

512
02:02:38,272 --> 02:02:44,538
Nice, isn’t it? Beautiful. Thank you
very much, thank you.

513
02:02:45,925 --> 02:02:49,785
I hope you have written your name there,
somewhere.

514
02:02:49,986 --> 02:02:53,112
Inside the box could be,

515
02:02:54,289 --> 02:02:59,485
inside the box, both of you.

516
02:02:59,746 --> 02:03:05,022
You should have given Me the present
after the marriage, not before.

517
02:03:09,839 --> 02:03:12,426
As it is.

518
02:03:18,836 --> 02:03:25,653
I would like to know the list of people who
want to get married and their photographs –

519
02:03:25,854 --> 02:03:30,230
would be a good idea if you can send it
to us earlier,

520
02:03:30,431 --> 02:03:33,571
before we go to India.

521
02:03:46,105 --> 02:03:48,857
I mean, we have a form,

522
02:03:49,058 --> 02:03:53,031
and you can get those forms from England,

523
02:03:53,232 --> 02:03:56,211
and they are to be filled in with
a photograph,

524
02:03:56,412 --> 02:04:01,428
so that we get some time to see for
ourselves, because from all over the world –

525
02:04:01,629 --> 02:04:07,055
see heights, and also qualifications, and
aptitudes and everything.

526
02:04:07,256 --> 02:04:11,185
So that we can match better.

527
02:04:11,415 --> 02:04:15,999
All right. Thank you. Thank you very much
for a very nice puja.

528
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:20,719
May God bless you all. Thank you for all
that you have done

529
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:25,774
for Sahaja Yoga, and all that you have
done to look after Me.

530
02:04:25,975 --> 02:04:28,828
A little translate.

531
02:04:39,136 --> 02:04:42,223
And to look after Me.

532
02:04:44,092 --> 02:04:46,767
May God bless you.

533
02:04:51,959 --> 02:04:54,858
Now look after the new people, with care.

534
02:04:55,059 --> 02:04:59,456
It’s very delicate, with care.

535
02:05:05,735 --> 02:05:11,263
It’s very delicate, with care.
Then your knowledge.

536
02:05:17,690 --> 02:05:20,628
May God bless you.

537
02:05:26,721 --> 02:05:30,367
Very good puja today, very good puja
I must say, very good.

538
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:19,079
Beautiful.

539
02:06:25,968 --> 02:06:30,764
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

540
02:06:32,998 --> 02:06:36,031
Very good puja I must say, very important.

541
02:06:36,541 --> 02:06:41,703
Done with heart, that’s the point is.
Done with heart, that is.
