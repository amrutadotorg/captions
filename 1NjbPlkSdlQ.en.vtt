02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:54.620
In my husband's generosity,

02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:59.390
he had asked me to give some presents for the

02:44:59.750 --> 02:45:03.172
Yova Shakti from Bombay that I have already given.

02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:04.712
I would like to tell him.

02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:08.560
But for the UK sahaja yogis who have helped him,

02:45:08.650 --> 02:45:10.370
I have got some presents for them.

02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:14.790
So please, one by one, you come and Mr. Srivastava will give.

02:45:19.697 --> 02:45:21.720
Please, Lathman, is he here?

02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:24.520
Please, Lathman.

02:45:25.390 --> 02:45:28.390
[?]

02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:54.821
Chris Packmore, Chris Marlow, Antonio,

02:45:58.220 --> 02:46:00.220
Hari Ramra.

02:46:08.840 --> 02:46:11.840
I think Antonio's brother is here.

02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:49.400
He's getting married here.

02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:07.980
And Daniela.

02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:12.400
[Hindi] That's different. Oh God!

02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:23.870
There's one for Derek Lee, but he's not come.

02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:29.600
Chris Marlow has not come.

02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:35.340
Chris Marlow is there? Chris Marlow?

02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:47.460
Chris Marlow.

02:48:04.330 --> 02:48:07.330
Chris Marlow?

02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:13.860
Chris Marlow, please.

02:48:14.950 --> 02:48:18.150
He's not here.

02:48:49.050 --> 02:48:54.050
All right, we'll send it for him in the tent. All right.

02:48:57.330 --> 02:49:04.330
Now, the whole atmosphere was created.

02:49:04.650 --> 02:49:08.450
All these things were erected.

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:15.600
To my surprise, such beautiful arrangements of electricity

02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:18.800
and everything was done of water.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000
The whole building, whatever you are,

02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.200
all done in a month's time by one great gentleman

02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:32.400
whom you know very well, is so dedicated, that is Mr. [?].

02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:38.388
He's done so much, and I do not know how to thank him.

02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:43.940
He's so disciplined, he's so determined and he's so dedicated.

02:49:43.970 --> 02:49:47.970
I think this will be your ideal for dedication.

02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:11.600
Thank you.

02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:32.800
For over for Baba Mama, I've already given a present in the room.

02:50:33.330 --> 02:50:38.330
All right. Tomorrow we are going to have...
