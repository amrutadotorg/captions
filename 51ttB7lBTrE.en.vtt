00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:37.813
I'll speak, I'll speak later on.
They will sing 'Jogwa'

00:00:38.358 --> 00:00:44.298
Just I'll explain. Jogwa you're going to
sing, na - I'll explain to them.

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:47.598
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:52.683
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI - STOP?]

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:10.539
I'm happy you're enjoying this music and
they want to give you, render some more

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:23.182
because I think, Philip has already explained,
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:29.608
Shri Mataji: so I don't have to talk too much then.
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.179
Shri Mataji: This Jogwa they are singing,
is a song written about 16th century

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:47.245
by a poet called Namadeva
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

00:01:47.977 --> 00:01:57.527
Shri Mataji: and he was a tailor and he
went to see another saint, who was a potter

00:01:58.102 --> 00:02:03.982
Interpreter: [GERMAN]

00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:10.492
Shri Mataji: So when he saw the potter,
he just stood silent and he said,

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:19.874
in Marathi language it is, 'That I came to
see the Formless,' that is the vibrations,

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:25.590
'I came to see the vibrations but here,
I find vibrations in Form."

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:37.460
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.526
Shri Mataji: So, what an appreciation of another
saint; Only a saint can do that, real saint.

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:51.318
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:55.657
Shri Mataji: So the saintliness is a state
- you cannot certify it. It's a state.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:00.616
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:10.993
Shri Mataji: So you have to be, you'll be listening
to this song, which was written by Namadeva

00:03:10.993 --> 00:03:19.687
and later on he went to Punjab and also, at that
time, Gurunanaka saw another saint coming in.

00:03:21.398 --> 00:03:31.752
[INTERPRETER - GERMAN]

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:37.422
Shri Mataji: So he said that, "Now you're
such a great saint and such a great poet,

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:42.466
so why don't you write in Punjabi
language?" So he studied Punjabi language

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:49.113
and wrote a big book, in Punjabi
language, of lots of poetry in it.

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:58.698
[INTERPRETER]

00:03:58.698 --> 00:04:06.408
[INTERPRETER]

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:13.211
Shri Mataji: So the scriptures of Gurunanaka,
which He has all the, He's compiled all the

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:20.194
poems of the poets, of who were saints at
that time, is called as 'Guru Granth Sahab'

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:28.340
[INTERPRETER]
What is the name?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.999
Shri Mataji: Guru Granth Sahab. Granth Sahab
is the one, which is, which is the
Holy Scripture for Sikhs.

00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:36.332
[INTERPRETER]

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:45.299
Shri Mataji: Hmm, and in that He has put
Namadeva's poems also and that of His maid
servant, who was another saint, Janabai.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:54.875
[INTERPRETER]

00:04:54.875 --> 00:05:02.641
Shri Mataji: In this song he's saying that,
"O Mother, I'm asking for yoga, for the

00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:10.168
union with the Divine." Jogwa means,
"O Mother give me the yoga of the Divine."

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.130
with the Divine means, the union
with the Divine.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:21.938
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.697
Shri Mataji: I mean, Jogwa means yoga
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:32.796
Shri Mataji: Yoga and then he says that,
"I've given up all that is a temper, which

00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:38.341
was my father-in-law," - like a lady he sings so.
"He was my father-in-law who was a temper,

00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:47.651
I had uh.. attachments, who were my husband,"
like that, "I've given up all my relations to all
these things."

00:05:48.328 --> 00:05:55.358
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:55.358 --> 00:05:59.412
[INTERPRETER]

00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:04.208
Shri Mataji: Then in the thing he says, 
"Now," - Amba is the Kundalini, so he says,

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:11.436
"Now rise the Kundalini - Uday, uday Ambe - Rise,
the Kundalini, rise - Uday, uday Ambe ho," like that.

00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:17.946
So it's sung in the villages.
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:17.946 --> 00:06:22.727
[INTERPRETER] should take off, take off 
Kundalini [INTERPRETER]

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:27.942
Shri Mataji: And for so many centuries, they have
been singing in Indian villages, this song.

00:06:28.024 --> 00:06:32.814
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:32.814 --> 00:06:40.517
Shri Mataji: So because of the climate in
India, we were not so much bothered about

00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:46.462
the outside projection but inside
projection. Climate is very good.

00:06:46.462 --> 00:06:49.468
You can live in a village, 
you can live in a forest.

00:06:49.887 --> 00:06:56.247
[INTERPRETER]

00:06:56.247 --> 00:07:01.046
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:01.077 --> 00:07:06.167
Shri Mataji: So they were meditative and
were trying to find out what is within us

00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:12.306
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:17.033
Shri Mataji: So the knowledge of Sahaja yoga was
available long time back, since the time of,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:24.080
we can say, since the time of Shri Rama, even
earlier than that people knew about Kundalini

00:07:24.832 --> 00:07:33.542
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:38.246
Shri Mataji: Even recently we had a big
film Ramayana. In that also they told how

00:07:38.246 --> 00:07:41.544
Rama was told about Kundalini by his guru

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:50.284
[INTERPRETER]

00:07:50.284 --> 00:07:56.527
Shri Mataji: But these gurus were realized souls.
They never took money, they didn't enslave people

00:07:56.763 --> 00:08:04.243
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:09.147
Shri Mataji: So like that, our country was
blessed by many real saints, very great saints.

00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:15.023
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:20.245
Shri Mataji: And they are not good at
Science, you can say, for the outward

00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:23.852
side of it but the inward search
was very deep.

00:08:23.852 --> 00:08:28.784
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:33.402
Shri Mataji: So you can imagine that
background is there already.

00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:38.573
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:45.105
Shri Mataji: So for ages, they know about
Kundalini, they know that Mother has to do that job.

00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:52.282
[INTERPRETER]

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:57.146
Shri Mataji: But as we have learnt so much
about machinery and Science from you,

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:03.718
which is the knowledge of the tree, you have
to also know the knowledge of the roots

00:09:04.095 --> 00:09:10.185
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:10.185 --> 00:09:16.416
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:23.354
Shri Mataji: otherwise this tree will be lost
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:28.818
Shri Mataji: and it is so simple and so
spontaneous, as you saw it yesterday.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:32.966
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:37.219
Shri Mataji: You have worked with your
brains, now you have to work with your heart.

00:09:37.219 --> 00:09:43.083
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:48.813
Shri Mataji: Now your brain has to love
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:53.287
Shri Mataji: That's what Sahaja yoga is.
[INTERPRETER]

00:09:53.287 --> 00:09:57.738
Shri Mataji: So, you can hear this song and with
this song, I'm sure, you all will get realization.

00:09:58.307 --> 00:10:04.127
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:06.804
Shri Mataji: Just take out your shoes,
so that's all.

00:10:06.804 --> 00:10:09.691
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:14.631
Shri Mataji: And you have to clap with that.
You have to clap.

00:10:15.146 --> 00:10:17.606
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:21.731
Shri Mataji: And when they say 'Ho', you
too do the same way. That's all.

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:27.454
Shri Mataji: When they say 'Ho', you have
to also do the same. It will all work out.
I won't have to give a lecture.

00:10:27.454 --> 00:10:31.193
[INTERPRETER]

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:34.675
Shri Mataji: Annh?(What?)
Baba Mama: The audience can't see us.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:37.149
We will stand up and sing. 
The audience can't see us.

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:45.821
Shri Mataji: No [MARATHI]
Some of you can stand. Some of you at the back.

00:10:46.247 --> 00:10:51.957
No, not the musicians who are not singing
- some Sahaja yogis, who are not singing

00:10:53.099 --> 00:10:56.239
can stand at the back.
