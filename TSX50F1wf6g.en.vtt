00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.935
Our main responsibility is,&nbsp;all the time, 
intensely, to think,

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:17.584
“What we can do for the betterment 
of human beings?

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.412
And what are we doing about it?”

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:28.833
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:32.460
because that was the best way 
to make people understand

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.560
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:42.928
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:46.395
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:49.127
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.139
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:55.411
is absolutely absurd!

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.491
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:04.894
why should it create human beings?

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:10.821
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:15.827
You have to do it.

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:20.747
Unless and until you become deep,

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:25.013
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:29.835
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.546
Now if there is no instrument, 
electricity cannot work, can it?

00:01:40.147 --> 00:01:43.462
Now you should say, 
“The electricity itself must come before me

00:01:43.663 --> 00:01:47.201
and must do everything!”

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:54.837
You have to have the instrument 
and you are the instrument

00:01:55.064 --> 00:02:01.177
and if you do not want to do it, 
how can Paramchaitanya do it?

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:03.959
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.718
that, “Let electricity do the job, 
we’ll not have any instrument.”

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:12.908
Can I work it out?

00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:16.408
Can you work it out?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.619
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

00:02:27.607 --> 00:02:31.498
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.451
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

00:02:38.832 --> 00:02:43.589
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.654
with the family, I don't know,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.221
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:02:51.885 --> 00:02:57.870
Now supposing this instrument, 
which is meant for my lecture,

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:03.181
forgets what it is

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.143
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:11.762
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:17.927
then what’s the use of making 
this useless instrument?

00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.262
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

00:03:22.567 --> 00:03:27.340
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

00:03:30.473 --> 00:03:36.308
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:46.320
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:50.665
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.853
like this that,

00:03:56.053 --> 00:04:00.719
“We’ve done our job. 
Let the young people do it now!”

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:06.827
You are matured,

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:10.205
and the matured have to do the job.

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:19.663
“We have done our level best!”.  
What have you done so far?

00:04:29.473 --> 00:04:32.559
So much to be done still.

00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.230
And somehow or other

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.169
we have to touch

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:43.959
that area where such people remain 
like the yesterday’s player.

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:47.541
He is not doing God’s work.

00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:52.887
He’s an artist

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:59.564
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:07.667
He will get the same amount 
whether he’s perfect or not,

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:14.809
but he’s practising at home,

00:05:15.052 --> 00:05:18.911
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:22.589
All the time working it out so that

00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:26.671
his performance should be excellent.

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:29.964
So he’s seeking an excellence.

00:05:30.206 --> 00:05:34.261
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:40.053 --> 00:05:42.686
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.870
Only through excellence 
you will really become Sahaj Yogis.
