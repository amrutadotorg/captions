WEBVTT

00:07.500 --> 00:12.935
Our main responsibility is, all the time,
intensely, to think,

00:13.135 --> 00:17.584
“What we can do for the betterment
of human beings?

00:20.319 --> 00:23.412
And what are we doing about it?”

00:25.896 --> 00:28.833
First I used to say, “Count your blessings,”

00:29.049 --> 00:32.460
because that was the best way
to make people understand

00:32.660 --> 00:36.560
that there are blessings in Sahaj Yoga.

00:40.481 --> 00:42.928
Now I would say, “Count your deeds.”

00:43.184 --> 00:46.395
What have you done for Sahaj Yoga?

00:46.676 --> 00:49.127
Sahaja Yoga has done so much for you.

00:49.785 --> 00:52.139
To say that Paramchaitanya will look after you

00:52.364 --> 00:55.411
is absolutely absurd!

00:59.004 --> 01:01.491
If Paramchaitanya could do everything

01:01.725 --> 01:04.894
why should it create human beings?

01:07.781 --> 01:10.821
One Adam and Eve were sufficient.

01:13.452 --> 01:15.827
You have to do it.

01:16.068 --> 01:20.747
Unless and until you become deep,

01:20.948 --> 01:25.013
it cannot trigger, it is helpless.

01:25.687 --> 01:29.835
It’s only through you it is going to work out.

01:34.959 --> 01:39.546
Now if there is no instrument,
electricity cannot work, can it?

01:40.147 --> 01:43.462
Now you should say,
“The electricity itself must come before me

01:43.663 --> 01:47.201
and must do everything!”

01:49.782 --> 01:54.837
You have to have the instrument
and you are the instrument

01:55.064 --> 02:01.177
and if you do not want to do it,
how can Paramchaitanya do it?

02:01.757 --> 02:03.959
It will be something like saying, as I told you,

02:04.040 --> 02:08.718
that, “Let electricity do the job,
we’ll not have any instrument.”

02:10.244 --> 02:12.908
Can I work it out?

02:13.457 --> 02:16.408
Can you work it out?

02:21.510 --> 02:26.619
So Paramchaitanya has its own style.

02:27.607 --> 02:31.498
It can only work if you people want to work it out.

02:31.810 --> 02:36.451
It’s an energy and you are the instrument.

02:38.832 --> 02:43.589
But the instrument is more busy with the job,

02:44.279 --> 02:46.654
with the family, I don't know,

02:47.690 --> 02:51.221
all kinds of nonsensical things.

02:51.885 --> 02:57.870
Now supposing this instrument,
which is meant for my lecture,

03:00.088 --> 03:03.181
forgets what it is

03:03.857 --> 03:07.143
and acts like a ladle in the kitchen

03:07.735 --> 03:11.762
because it’s fond of food, say, for example:

03:13.778 --> 03:17.927
then what’s the use of making
this useless instrument?

03:18.161 --> 03:21.262
It doesn’t do what it has to do.

03:22.567 --> 03:27.340
It doesn’t know what it has been made for.

03:30.473 --> 03:36.308
It has no purpose at all. It’s such a useless stuff.

03:41.708 --> 03:46.320
So I feel there’s a kind of a lethargy,

03:46.521 --> 03:50.665
a kind of a very subtle lethargy working out,

03:54.259 --> 03:55.853
like this that,

03:56.053 --> 04:00.719
“We’ve done our job.
Let the young people do it now!”

04:04.311 --> 04:06.827
You are matured,

04:07.101 --> 04:10.205
and the matured have to do the job.

04:15.366 --> 04:19.663
“We have done our level best!”.
What have you done so far?

04:29.473 --> 04:32.559
So much to be done still.

04:33.301 --> 04:36.230
And somehow or other

04:37.746 --> 04:39.169
we have to touch

04:39.424 --> 04:43.959
that area where such people remain
like the yesterday’s player.

04:44.237 --> 04:47.541
He is not doing God’s work.

04:49.963 --> 04:52.887
He’s an artist

04:54.705 --> 04:59.564
and he’s working so hard to achieve perfection.

05:03.776 --> 05:07.667
He will get the same amount
whether he’s perfect or not,

05:12.748 --> 05:14.809
but he’s practising at home,

05:15.052 --> 05:18.911
he’s listening to it, he’s trying to develop it.

05:20.036 --> 05:22.589
All the time working it out so that

05:22.882 --> 05:26.671
his performance should be excellent.

05:27.489 --> 05:29.964
So he’s seeking an excellence.

05:30.206 --> 05:34.261
Mediocrity has no place in Sahaj Yoga.

05:40.053 --> 05:42.686
Only through excellence you’ll enjoy.

05:42.889 --> 05:48.870
Only through excellence
you will really become Sahaj Yogis.
