1
00:04:02,909 --> 00:05:36,030
00:05:27:15 00:05:36:03 Today we have gathered
here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

2
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,810
00:05:36:03 00:05:38:22 as well as your own
Kundalini.

3
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:53,110
00:05:38:24 00:05:53:00 First of all, I think
this is the most important thing to understand

4
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,639
00:05:53:01 00:05:55:04 about your own Kundalini,
00:05:55:05 00:05:59:09 as Self-realization

5
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,750
is Self-knowledge
00:05:59:10 00:06:06:04 and the one who gives

6
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:09,810
you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini
00:06:06:05 00:06:14:12 because, when she

7
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,730
rises, she points it out, what are the problems
on your chakras.

8
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,810
00:06:14:13 00:06:20:03 Now, we say that it
is pure desire,

9
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,330
00:06:20:04 00:06:24:13 but we do not know
what purity means.

10
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,180
00:06:24:13 00:06:28:02 It means your chaste
desire.

11
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:38,130
00:06:28:03 00:06:37:05 It means it has no
lust, greed, anything in it.

12
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:44,170
00:06:37:05 00:06:43:14 That power is your
own Mother and is settled

13
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,910
00:06:43:14 00:06:46:13 in your triangular
bone.

14
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,070
She's your own mother.

15
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,180
00:06:46:14 00:06:50:05 She knows everything
about you, it's like a tape recorder.

16
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,800
00:06:50:06 00:06:52:22 She knows everything
about you

17
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:09,500
00:06:52:22 00:07:07:22 and she is absolutely
the knowledge - because she's so pure.

18
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:23,300
00:07:07:24 00:07:23:03 And, whatever chakras
she touches, she also knows what's wrong with

19
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,210
that chakra
00:07:23:04 00:07:31:04 beforehand, so she's

20
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:37,080
quite prepared,
00:07:31:05 00:07:37:11 and she adjusts herself

21
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,440
fully
00:07:37:12 00:07:45:12 so that you do not

22
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,440
get a problem by her awakening.

23
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,209
00:07:45:13 00:07:51:12 If any chakra is constricted,
she waits

24
00:07:53,209 --> 00:08:00,300
00:07:51:13 00:07:58:13 and goes on slowly
opening that chakra.

25
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:10,110
00:07:58:14 00:08:09:16 Now, this Kundalini
is the primordial power which is reflected

26
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,570
within you,
00:08:09:16 00:08:15:03 and within you, in

27
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:22,810
a human being, it is
00:08:15:04 00:08:25:08 like many strands

28
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,500
of energy.

29
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,240
So it's like a rope
00:08:25:08 00:08:35:11 and these energies

30
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,599
are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

31
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:47,009
00:08:35:11 00:08:45:19 In a human being these
strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one

32
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:48,009
—
00:08:45:19 00:08:48:00 raised to power hundred

33
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:49,009
and eight.

34
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:52,550
00:08:48:01 00:08:51:12 But when your Kundalini
rises,

35
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:59,070
00:08:51:13 00:08:58:17 one or two strands
out of this come up and pierce the fontanel

36
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,070
bone area.

37
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:09,420
00:08:58:18 00:09:07:20 Only one or two because
it has to pass through the innermost nadi,

38
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,880
00:09:07:21 00:09:15:07 known as Brahma Nadi.

39
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,700
It's all a spiral throughout
00:09:15:08 00:09:28:24 because Kundalini

40
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:29,420
is a spiral and these nadis are also are like
a spiral like this.

41
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,140
00:09:28:24 00:09:33:06 So the innermost nadi
is the Brahma Nadi.

42
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:43,390
00:09:33:07 00:09:41:08 The outermost nadi
is the right side

43
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,740
00:09:41:09 00:09:49:14 and the second innermost
is the Ida Nadi.

44
00:09:50,740 --> 00:10:00,040
00:09:49:15 00:09:57:20 So, through the Brahma
Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

45
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,709
00:09:57:21 00:10:07:14 By that, they relax
the center.

46
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:15,050
By the relaxation of the center,
00:10:07:14 00:10:15:17 the sympathetic nervous

47
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:22,140
system also starts relaxing
00:10:15:18 00:10:21:06 and when it goes to

48
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,570
the Agnya Chakra,
00:10:21:07 00:10:26:01 then your eyes start

49
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,740
relaxing,
00:10:26:01 00:10:28:24 your pupils start

50
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,290
dilating
00:10:28:24 00:10:34:19 and your eyes can

51
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:40,240
become like Mine,
00:10:34:20 00:10:38:20 very black, absolutely

52
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
relaxed.

53
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,170
00:10:38:20 00:10:41:22 So, you can easily
see in a person

54
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,330
00:10:41:24 00:10:46:14 how far is the Kundalini.

55
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,870
If it has pierced the Agnya,
00:10:46:14 00:10:51:14 then the eyes will

56
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,220
be completely dilated and will be shining
00:10:51:15 00:10:55:16 and then she enters

57
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,620
into the Sahasrara.

58
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:04,829
00:10:55:17 00:11:01:22 Now, it is absolutely
pure light of knowledge,

59
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:12,170
00:11:01:21 00:11:07:22 love, compassion and
attention;

60
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,120
00:11:07:22 00:11:18:03 all these three things
are in that energy.

61
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,100
00:11:18:04 00:11:21:22 We know of many energies;
like electrical energy,

62
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,660
00:11:21:22 00:11:27:06 we know of light energy,
we know of other energies.

63
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:36,710
00:11:27:07 00:11:34:06 But these energies
cannot think, they cannot adjust,

64
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,220
00:11:34:06 00:11:38:01 they cannot work on
their own.

65
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,600
00:11:38:02 00:11:43:13 They are to be handled
by us.

66
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,670
00:11:43:13 00:11:49:11 But this energy, itself,
is the living energy

67
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,430
00:11:49:11 00:11:56:22 and knows how to handle
itself.

68
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,839
It thinks.

69
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,709
00:11:56:22 00:12:04:05 If you see a seed
being sprouted,

70
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:12,779
00:12:04:05 00:12:09:20 you'll find at the
tip of the seed there's a small little cell

71
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,810
00:12:09:20 00:12:15:01 which knows how to
go around the soft places

72
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:23,970
00:12:15:02 00:12:21:24 and then how to encircle
the stones and then how to find its way to

73
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,790
the source.

74
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:32,060
00:12:21:24 00:12:29:14 That cell has got,
I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

75
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,519
00:12:29:14 00:12:31:15 the way it moves.

76
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:42,819
00:12:31:15 00:12:40:02 But within you is
... a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

77
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:48,629
00:12:40:02 00:12:46:00 So, you have a storehouse
of compassion,

78
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,759
00:12:46:00 00:12:51:15 which can be enlightened
by the spirit.

79
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:01,910
00:12:51:15 00:12:58:08 You have a storehouse
of love, compassion

80
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,240
00:12:58:08 00:13:04:22 and knowledge and
ocean of forgiveness.

81
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:15,689
00:13:04:22 00:13:12:19 When people get realization,
they do not understand

82
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:18,110
00:13:12:20 00:13:17:24 that they have to
now grow.

83
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,670
And why they don't grow?

84
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:25,029
00:13:18:00 00:13:22:05 Because they do not
ask for these energies.

85
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:30,459
00:13:22:06 00:13:27:20 A person who is a
realized soul, if he says that,

86
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,910
00:13:27:21 00:13:31:08 "I have to have more
compassion.

87
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,249
00:13:31:08 00:13:35:05 My compassion is not
all right.

88
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:44,139
00:13:35:06 00:13:40:20 My concern about others
is not all right.

89
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:46,929
00:13:40:20 00:13:43:12 My generosity is not
all right.

90
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:52,320
00:13:43:13 00:13:50:14 I'm exploiting others.

91
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,680
I'm exploiting their love,"
00:13:50:15 00:13:58:00 then this energy starts

92
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,470
moving,
00:13:58:00 00:14:03:02 giving you that greater

93
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,350
dimension of love and compassion.

94
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:20,529
00:14:03:02 00:14:21:19 But, if you do not
want to be 

95
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:25,220
growing in your awareness, then she ... she
says,

96
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,699
00:14:21:20 00:14:25:11 "All right, he is
a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be",

97
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:32,250
00:14:25:11 00:14:28:21 she doesn't supply
that energy

98
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,110
00:14:28:22 00:14:30:15 which is stored within
you.

99
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:39,629
00:14:30:15 00:14:36:12 I told you, three
into seven, that is twenty-one,

100
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,350
00:14:36:13 00:14:39:14 raised to power hundred
and eight.

101
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,949
00:14:39:14 00:14:44:00 So what a storage
you have within yourself.

102
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:55,420
00:14:44:01 00:14:51:21 But because of your
mundane style of thinking and asking —

103
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,689
00:14:51:21 00:14:59:20 in the beginning,
when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to

104
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:06,379
ask for, say, jobs
00:14:59:20 00:15:04:07 or for 'My mother

105
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:10,040
is sick' or a father is sick
00:15:04:07 00:15:09:12 or they would ask

106
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,240
for money or something like that.

107
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,449
00:15:09:13 00:15:16:14 So these wants are
not pure wants.

108
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:24,759
00:15:16:15 00:15:19:19 As we know in economics,
they are not pure wants.

109
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:30,249
00:15:19:19 00:15:26:02 They're impure wants
because they are never satiable in general.

110
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:33,559
00:15:26:02 00:15:29:14 So this Kundalini
that is your Mother,

111
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,910
00:15:29:14 00:15:34:04 she is there to supply
you, nourish you, to look after you,

112
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:47,269
00:15:34:05 00:15:43:22 to make you grow by
giving you a higher personality —

113
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:55,879
00:15:43:24 00:15:56:17 higher personality,
wider personality, deeper personality.

114
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:05,339
00:15:56:18 00:16:04:22 Now, we think if somebody
is well read,

115
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:11,300
00:16:04:22 00:16:07:07 then we think he is
a higher personality.

116
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,279
00:16:07:08 00:16:11:08 Sometimes a person
who is rich,

117
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,149
00:16:11:08 00:16:13:14 we think he is a higher
personality.

118
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,389
00:16:13:15 00:16:19:06 Sometimes we think
a person who is very hard working

119
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,250
00:16:19:07 00:16:21:05 is a higher personality.

120
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:32,199
00:16:21:05 00:16:28:22 Sometimes we think
a person who is, I mean,

121
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:40,290
00:16:28:22 00:16:36:00 some sort of a confusion
about religion or something,

122
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,369
00:16:36:00 00:16:39:02 we think he is a higher
personality.

123
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:49,889
00:16:39:02 00:16:45:08 Our ideas about higher
personality itself are wrong.

124
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:54,829
00:16:45:09 00:16:50:24 People are higher
because they are spiritually evolved.

125
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,149
00:16:50:24 00:16:56:24 Otherwise, they are
not.

126
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,470
They go to dogs.

127
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,209
Nobody respects them.

128
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:05,230
00:16:57:00 00:17:00:16 Now we are in Germany
and Germany —

129
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,580
00:17:00:16 00:17:10:01 'germ' itself means
actually 'Kundalini'.

130
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,400
Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, 'ankura'.

131
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,959
00:17:10:02 00:17:16:08 Ankura is the germ.

132
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,020
And Germany is the place
00:17:16:09 00:17:22:11 where we can have

133
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,620
Kundalini Puja, is something really a great
coincidence

134
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,440
00:17:22:12 00:17:27:11 or I think it's just
Paramchaitanya's arrangements.

135
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:42,360
00:17:27:12 00:17:37:20 So, to look at a seed,
looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special

136
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,240
—
00:17:37:21 00:17:44:24 could be very hard

137
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,670
nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts,
mostly.

138
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,260
00:17:45:00 00:17:52:00 If they are not in
nuts, then they might be having some sheath

139
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,350
or something, minimum.

140
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:01,330
00:17:52:01 00:17:57:03 But you won't find
a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

141
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,750
00:17:57:04 00:18:00:01 It has to have some
protection,

142
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,460
00:18:00:02 00:18:05:01 some sort of a hardness
outside.

143
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:19,720
00:18:05:02 00:18:14:14 Now, that hardness
is there, but the germ

144
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,230
00:18:14:15 00:18:17:08 has a capacity to
break that hardness.

145
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,620
00:18:17:08 00:18:22:14 Just imagine a germ,
which is such a delicate thing,

146
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,890
00:18:22:14 00:18:26:00 which even if you
touch it might break.

147
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,070
Can it break?

148
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:38,360
00:18:26:00 00:18:34:11 A germ -- can it break
the covering, the hard shell?

149
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,000
00:18:34:12 00:18:38:11 How can it do it?

150
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,690
Isn't it fantastic
00:18:38:11 00:18:42:19 that such a hard shell,

151
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,740
00:18:42:20 00:18:47:11 which we cannot break
it with our teeth even,

152
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,380
00:18:47:12 00:18:52:13 can be easily broken
by a delicate germ.

153
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,370
00:18:52:14 00:18:59:08 So at that time, what
happens

154
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:16,120
00:18:59:08 00:19:12:02 is the shell itself
doesn't become lively.

155
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,650
It doesn't get life.

156
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,620
00:19:12:03 00:19:22:18 There is no movement
of the shell itself, but it moves

157
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:33,340
00:19:22:18 00:19:31:14 and it opens.

158
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:39,960
So that delicate thing, when it grows,
00:19:31:15 00:19:36:00 then the shell has

159
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,120
to crack.

160
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,450
00:19:36:01 00:19:40:15 In the same way, this
Kundalini,

161
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,500
00:19:40:16 00:19:42:10 which is a delicate
thing —

162
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,530
00:19:42:10 00:19:46:11 if you see a person
who is compassionate.

163
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,400
"Oh," they say,
00:19:46:11 00:19:50:00 "Mother, he's too

164
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,820
much a gem, you know."

165
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,800
00:19:50:00 00:19:54:18 Everybody has sort
of a sympathy,

166
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,120
00:19:54:19 00:19:57:20 protectiveness for
that person.

167
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,860
00:19:57:20 00:20:06:10 "He's just, Mother,
he's just compassion, and all.

168
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,309
It's too much."

169
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,260
We always feel
00:20:06:10 00:20:13:09 such a person to be

170
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,390
very — a weakling, a weak personality and
that he should be protected.

171
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,110
00:20:13:10 00:20:19:07 "Oh, Mother, he doesn't
know also how to abuse people.

172
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,299
How will he beat anyone?

173
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,930
00:20:19:07 00:20:23:22 He cannot even kill
an ant, ant on the road.

174
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,549
00:20:23:22 00:20:27:09 How can he do anything
when he's good for nothing?"

175
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,549
00:20:27:09 00:20:31:20 That's our concept,
because we think

176
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:43,210
00:20:31:21 00:20:36:14 we should have somebody
really a tyrannical person to handle things.

177
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:54,960
00:20:36:15 00:20:50:12 But just see that
in a seed, it is that delicate germ grows

178
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,650
00:20:50:13 00:20:56:24 and breaks the shell.

179
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:08,740
In the same way,
00:20:57:00 00:21:08:14 when we become really

180
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:18,920
delicate like a germ
00:21:08:15 00:21:20:07 and then grow in our

181
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:30,310
delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,
00:21:20:07 00:21:26:02 love and knowledge

182
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,120
which makes you humble,
00:21:26:02 00:21:29:09 then these shells

183
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,500
will break.

184
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,270
00:21:29:09 00:21:34:13 But it's the other
way round, normally.

185
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,350
00:21:34:14 00:21:41:04 In Sahaja Yoga now,
we have leaders.

186
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,280
We've had leaders and leaders and leaders.

187
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,640
00:21:41:04 00:21:46:07 Some of them came
like tigers.

188
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,980
00:21:46:08 00:21:50:10 I didn't know what
to do to them.

189
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,810
00:21:50:11 00:21:56:19 Even tiger can be
ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

190
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:12,320
00:21:56:20 00:22:05:02 because this love
has the power to break any hard nut.

191
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,740
00:22:05:03 00:22:11:10 So what we should
ask for

192
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:25,880
00:22:11:11 00:22:20:19 is that beautiful,
soft, soft, compassionate nature,

193
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,310
00:22:20:20 00:22:23:15 and then the Kundalini
will supply

194
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,290
00:22:23:16 00:22:33:14 because she only has
that.

195
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:40,380
Kundalini doesn't have anything else.

196
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:47,410
00:22:33:15 00:22:41:06 All her power is of
love, nothing but love.

197
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:53,770
00:22:41:07 00:22:47:02 So how can she give
you something she doesn't have?

198
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,580
00:22:47:02 00:22:52:22 Supposing you hate
someone, what can she do?

199
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:04,600
00:22:52:22 00:22:56:22 She can't do anything
because she cannot give you powers to hate.

200
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,130
00:22:56:22 00:23:03:17 So what she says,
"You hate someone,

201
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,299
00:23:03:18 00:23:07:08 or you forgive..."

202
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,590
She gives you the power to forgive.

203
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,460
00:23:07:09 00:23:12:00 Like a sword has to
fight a shield,

204
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,350
00:23:12:00 00:23:17:19 not a sword.

205
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,890
So the violence, as they say,
00:23:17:20 00:23:20:16 can only be fought

206
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,890
with non-violence.

207
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,720
00:23:20:16 00:23:25:02 In the same way, if
we have to grow,

208
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,250
00:23:25:02 00:23:27:16 the Sahaja Yogis have
to grow, first of all

209
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:44,520
00:23:27:16 00:23:36:08 we have to see how
softly we talk, how kindly we talk,

210
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:50,800
00:23:36:09 00:23:48:02 how considerate we
are.

211
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:58,390
Now this is externally,
00:23:48:03 00:23:52:08 but when you start

212
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,810
doing that externally
00:23:52:08 00:23:55:20 the energy starts

213
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,810
coming internally.

214
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,080
00:23:55:20 00:23:57:18 You might say, "Mother,
even if you think —"

215
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,090
00:23:57:19 00:24:00:17 So that's our thinking.

216
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,690
No,
00:24:00:18 00:24:02:18 you're thinking that

217
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,690
time.

218
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,260
00:24:02:18 00:24:07:04 For that thinking,
the energy will come from Kundalini

219
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,080
00:24:07:04 00:24:09:16 because you're asking
her help.

220
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,651
00:24:09:17 00:24:16:12 Whatever she has,
she is willing to give, but

221
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:26,960
00:24:16:13 00:24:18:17 whatever she does
not have, how can she give?

222
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,020
00:24:18:17 00:24:22:07 Now, supposing you
want to get angry,

223
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,050
00:24:22:07 00:24:26:07 she hasn't got the
power to show anger,

224
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:41,520
00:24:26:08 00:24:34:09 so how can she give
you anger and temper.

225
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:50,030
00:24:34:10 00:24:40:21 I mean, sometimes
I try, "Let's see if I can get into ego."

226
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:59,730
00:24:40:22 00:24:52:22 How to get, I don't
know because this Kundalini doesn't know what

227
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,910
is this ego,
00:24:52:22 00:24:59:11 how to pamper the

228
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,520
ego and how to make you fly in the air.

229
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,880
No.
00:24:59:12 00:25:05:12 So whatever kind of

230
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,520
energy she is, she will give you that.

231
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:21,150
00:25:05:12 00:25:07:22 So please remember,
00:25:07:22 00:25:15:18 those who try to bring

232
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,490
in assertions
00:25:15:19 00:25:19:21 and conditionings

233
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,900
and ego
00:25:19:22 00:25:28:00 and all that are not

234
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,140
going to grow because they are not getting
the energy

235
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:42,280
00:25:28:01 00:25:32:11 from the Kundalini,
but from outside which is absolutely useless.

236
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:59,250
00:25:32:12 00:25:52:15 So the power of Kundalini
is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

237
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:11,780
00:25:52:15 00:26:04:07 holiness, chastity,
self-respect, pure love,

238
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:22,520
00:26:04:08 00:26:13:04 detachment, concern,
enlightened attention --

239
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:31,110
00:26:13:05 00:26:20:16 to give you joy,
00:26:20:16 00:26:25:24 as every mother wants

240
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,580
that her child should get the joy.

241
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,970
00:26:26:00 00:26:32:12 Whichever way is possible,
she'll try to give joy to her children.

242
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,140
00:26:32:13 00:26:36:16 In the same way, this
Kundalini has only one power —

243
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:55,240
00:26:36:17 00:26:46:07 how to give joy to
her own children -- and she does that.

244
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,010
00:26:46:07 00:26:49:06 Supposing — I mean,
00:26:49:06 00:26:51:10 I don't know about

245
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:04,830
modern mothers,
00:26:51:11 00:26:59:07 but normally if I

246
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,230
would go and say to my mother,
00:26:59:07 00:27:02:11 "Teach me how to be

247
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,580
angry,"
00:27:02:12 00:27:06:10 she will say, "You

248
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,030
go and cut your nose."

249
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:24,700
00:27:06:11 00:27:15:10 If I tell her that,
"Tell me how to tell lies,"

250
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,470
00:27:15:10 00:27:20:14 she'll say, "Go and
cut your tongue."

251
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,370
00:27:20:15 00:27:24:17 If I say, "Tell me
how to see bad things in others,"

252
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,380
00:27:24:18 00:27:28:16 she'll say, "take
out your eyes is better."

253
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:52,260
00:27:28:17 00:27:41:18 All these ideas that
we have within ourselves

254
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,470
00:27:41:18 00:27:49:16 make a very big problem
for Kundalini

255
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,460
00:27:49:17 00:27:52:11 to enter into your
attention.

256
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,830
00:27:52:12 00:27:56:04 Now, people always
ask,

257
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,770
00:27:56:05 00:27:57:19 "Mother, how are we
to grow?

258
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,300
00:27:57:19 00:27:60:00 What should we do?"

259
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,930
00:28:00:01 00:28:04:07 That's why I say introspection.

260
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,250
00:28:04:08 00:28:08:09 There should be introspection.

261
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:20,990
00:28:08:10 00:28:12:11 "What do I want in
this life?

262
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,610
00:28:12:11 00:28:17:16 I should be able to
love many more people

263
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:33,010
00:28:17:17 00:28:20:22 without any lust or
greed or expectations."

264
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,410
00:28:20:22 00:28:36:04 All right.

265
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:49,340
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

266
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:56,880
00:28:36:05 00:28:49:04 She gives you witness
state.

267
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
She gives you peace.

268
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,611
00:28:49:05 00:28:52:22 How many things she
has to give you

269
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:14,120
00:28:52:24 00:29:06:22 by which you become
so powerful, so very powerful.

270
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:28,770
00:29:06:24 00:29:40:07 No one can trouble
you.

271
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:54,250
00:29:40:07 00:29:50:02 She gives you security.

272
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,010
She gives you peace.

273
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:01,250
She gives you wisdom.

274
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:12,780
00:29:50:03 00:30:03:06 But if you want to
ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

275
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,000
00:30:03:07 00:30:07:06 It is impossible.

276
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,840
She hasn't got it with her.

277
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,590
00:30:07:07 00:30:14:03 So every Sahaja Yogi
who has to grow,

278
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:36,010
00:30:14:04 00:30:25:12 must know what is
in store with your own Kundalini.

279
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:41,430
00:30:25:13 00:30:31:15 So now, if you try
to do the other way round,

280
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,150
00:30:31:16 00:30:34:15 you jump on the left
or the right side.

281
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:51,080
00:30:34:15 00:30:39:15 Jump on the left side,
then you start moving on the left side,

282
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,490
00:30:39:16 00:30:44:12 then you can become
anything.

283
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,090
00:30:44:13 00:30:51:18 Whatever we hear about
people, the way they murder and rape and this

284
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,360
and that
00:30:51:18 00:30:56:11 and all these things

285
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,560
start coming in very easily
00:30:56:12 00:31:02:22 because that energy

286
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,150
lies beyond the Kundalini.

287
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:19,410
00:31:02:22 00:31:09:00 Because you move on
that side —

288
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,610
00:31:09:01 00:31:11:13 all right, you want
bhoots, have them.

289
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,490
00:31:11:14 00:31:13:13 You want diseases,
have them.

290
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,850
00:31:13:14 00:31:18:16 You want to indulge
into filthy things, have the filth.

291
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,440
00:31:18:16 00:31:21:21 Whatever you want,
you can have it.

292
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,060
00:31:21:21 00:31:28:01 Also, that is available.

293
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,720
Nobody can stop you.

294
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,730
00:31:28:02 00:31:31:17 You want to be sly,
00:31:31:18 00:31:36:22 you want to be talking

295
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,090
behind the backs, all right go ahead.

296
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,170
00:31:36:22 00:31:38:22 This is also very
common.

297
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,360
I've heard
00:31:38:22 00:31:40:22 that the Sahaja Yogis,

298
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,559
specially ladies,
00:31:40:22 00:31:45:20 go on talking behind

299
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,960
about others, discussing.

300
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,130
00:31:45:21 00:31:48:19 This is how we can
never grow.

301
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:05,450
00:31:48:19 00:31:53:18 If you have to talk,
only talk good about others.

302
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,890
00:31:53:19 00:31:58:05 Otherwise, don't talk,
best is.

303
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:16,210
00:31:58:06 00:32:05:19 These things are not
going to help us.

304
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:24,280
00:32:05:20 00:32:13:21 Now we are not here
in this world, at this stage, to build them

305
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,080
more churches
00:32:13:22 00:32:17:05 or temples or mosques.

306
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,430
No — had enough of them,
00:32:17:06 00:32:21:04 had enough of problems.

307
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,080
00:32:21:05 00:32:26:04 So now we want to
make for ourselves

308
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,460
00:32:26:04 00:32:30:01 abode of love and
purity,

309
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,260
00:32:30:02 00:32:32:06 but those who are
residents are not,

310
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,440
00:32:32:07 00:32:35:12 then how can you have
love?

311
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:54,950
00:32:35:13 00:32:43:04 It will be always
jealousies and selfishness and all those things,

312
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,950
there.

313
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,380
00:32:43:05 00:32:48:03 So when we talk of
the light of the Kundalini,

314
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:10,260
00:32:48:04 00:32:59:20 we have to understand
that this light, this light spreads in your

315
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,950
life,
00:32:59:20 00:33:05:07 outside your life

316
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,700
and expresses itself
00:33:05:08 00:33:08:07 in a very, very beautiful

317
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
manner.

318
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,950
00:33:08:08 00:33:12:02 Everyone says that
Sahaja Yogis

319
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,790
00:33:12:02 00:33:14:04 look very different
from others.

320
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,040
00:33:14:04 00:33:18:17 "There's a glow on
their face.

321
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,220
There's a ... they look like flowers",
00:33:18:18 00:33:25:14 so many, "Relaxed.

322
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,100
They're very beautiful people".

323
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,790
00:33:25:14 00:33:28:04 For example, in Cabella
people were so impressed.

324
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,390
00:33:28:04 00:33:32:22 They said "These are
young people and they have come here,

325
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,330
00:33:32:24 00:33:37:02 they're not fighting
among themselves, there are no hooligans among

326
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,330
them".

327
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,420
00:33:37:03 00:33:39:07 They're quite surprised
how you

328
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,140
00:33:39:08 00:33:42:02 could be so sensible,
so many of you.

329
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,420
00:33:42:03 00:33:44:22 So many people if
they gather anywhere,

330
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,140
00:33:44:22 00:33:50:08 they can go amok in
no time.

331
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:05,430
00:33:50:08 00:33:54:01 I mean, even a smaller
group

332
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,830
00:33:54:01 00:33:56:04 can become mad.

333
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,960
00:33:56:05 00:33:59:00 For no rhyme and reason
they go mad.

334
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:20,350
00:33:59:01 00:34:09:07 So this collective
behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

335
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:27,500
00:34:09:07 00:34:13:07 by those simple village
people.

336
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:34,659
00:34:13:07 00:34:26:10 For that, you have
to just desire.

337
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:40,250
You just have to desire
00:34:26:11 00:34:31:07 and this pure desire

338
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,879
works out in the right direction,
00:34:31:08 00:34:34:02 otherwise whatever

339
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,200
you desire you can't get it.

340
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
00:34:34:03 00:34:35:19 You want money?

341
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
All right, have it.

342
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,399
00:34:35:20 00:34:37:21 Move to the right
side.

343
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,670
00:34:37:21 00:34:41:11 Get money this way.

344
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,040
Get money that way.

345
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,210
Do what you like.

346
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,929
00:34:41:12 00:34:46:15 Then you want to kill
somebody.

347
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,290
All right, get to the right side.

348
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,040
00:34:46:15 00:34:49:22 You can get many people
00:34:49:22 00:34:52:08 who will go and kill

349
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,400
anybody they want to.

350
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,050
00:34:52:08 00:34:56:07 Then you want some
publicity or something.

351
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,069
00:34:56:08 00:34:58:10 All right, get to
the right side.

352
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:21,250
00:34:58:11 00:35:09:11 All these things can
happen, whatever you want

353
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:27,120
00:35:09:12 00:35:14:10 according to the movement
that you have.

354
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:39,220
00:35:14:11 00:35:26:06 But for ascent, your
desire should be pure desire

355
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:48,850
00:35:26:07 00:35:33:18 to get to that greater
personality

356
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:58,780
00:35:33:19 00:35:46:09 of love and beautiful
relationships.

357
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:04,590
00:35:46:10 00:35:52:22 Today you're worshipping
your Kundalini.

358
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:11,280
00:35:52:22 00:35:56:09 You are also worshipping
the Adi Kundalini.

359
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:22,430
00:35:56:10 00:36:09:10 Now, you have to find
out what are we doing

360
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:30,150
00:36:09:11 00:36:18:22 as far as the Adi
Kundalini is concerned.

361
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:37,460
00:36:18:24 00:36:24:08 When you worship the
Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

362
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,170
00:36:24:09 00:36:28:20 which is your own
Kundalini, feels very happy.

363
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,859
00:36:28:20 00:36:32:06 Also the Deities feel
happy.

364
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:48,530
00:36:32:07 00:36:35:22 In that happy mood,
you can achieve

365
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,900
00:36:35:22 00:36:40:17 a very much deeper
experience.

366
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,520
That's a fact.

367
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,160
00:36:40:18 00:36:47:18 But, to keep it up,
you have to meditate, otherwise

368
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,280
00:36:47:19 00:36:51:07 all these strands
will go back, slip down,

369
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,859
00:36:51:08 00:36:54:24 which have come out
in the puja.

370
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:15,440
00:36:55:00 00:37:00:07 I know everyone likes
to come to puja, they enjoy it.

371
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:24,580
00:37:00:08 00:37:11:09 But you should understand
that, 'what do we get in this puja?'.

372
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:31,920
00:37:11:09 00:37:18:04 You come here -- desire
for that higher life.

373
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:39,000
00:37:18:05 00:37:26:18 But try to get out
of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

374
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,109
00:37:26:19 00:37:29:17 If you want, you can
do it.

375
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:45,060
00:37:29:17 00:37:31:14 It's again a question
of your wanting.

376
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,230
00:37:31:14 00:37:39:10 So throughout it is
'want'.

377
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,910
What is your desire?

378
00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:03,140
00:37:39:11 00:37:50:08 We have desire like
'children'.

379
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,630
00:37:50:08 00:37:54:03 Some people want to
have children.

380
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,590
00:37:54:04 00:37:58:14 After the children
are born, then they say,

381
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,930
00:37:58:15 00:38:03:07 "Wow, what these children!

382
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,930
God save me!"

383
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:23,799
00:38:03:08 00:38:10:03 Then you want to have
money

384
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:34,039
00:38:10:04 00:38:15:05 and most of those
money people are now in jail.

385
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:43,099
00:38:15:05 00:38:34:13 Then you want to have
fame.

386
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:52,999
The fame of the people never helps them,
00:38:34:14 00:38:44:15 only it gives you

387
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:57,940
problems because of jealousies and all kinds
of things.

388
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,019
00:38:44:15 00:38:47:17 If fame was such a
good thing,

389
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:05,680
00:38:47:17 00:38:49:15 why should people
be jealous?

390
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:18,609
00:38:49:16 00:39:04:10 So the power of Kundalini,
which is your own mother,

391
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:27,910
00:39:04:11 00:39:13:16 which has to .. which
has to rise, which has to come up,

392
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,700
00:39:13:17 00:39:17:04 which has to manifest
itself,

393
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:37,609
00:39:17:04 00:39:25:05 because of your pure
desire.

394
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:41,130
So in your introspection,
00:39:25:06 00:39:28:05 in your pujas, in

395
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:44,819
your meditation,
00:39:28:06 00:39:34:05 if you see for yourself

396
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:52,109
why are you meditating --
00:39:34:06 00:39:39:05 it is for pure desire

397
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:55,440
of compassion
00:39:39:06 00:39:42:00 and love to be awakened

398
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,970
within us --
00:39:42:01 00:39:48:17 you are already in

399
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,890
the meditation, you're already growing,
00:39:48:18 00:39:52:17 the growth has started.

400
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,551
And you'll grow so fast
00:39:52:18 00:39:57:04 that this shell, which

401
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:12,800
is this human conditioning
00:39:57:05 00:40:04:21 and egos will just

402
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,619
break open.

403
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:20,069
And then this small little thing
00:40:04:21 00:40:10:01 which is only in the

404
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:24,799
triangular bone — imagine in a .. there's
a very little

405
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:31,690
00:40:10:01 00:40:17:01 space in the triangular
bone — that it comes out and manifests

406
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:35,049
00:40:17:02 00:40:20:15 and can save the whole
world.

407
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:41,869
00:40:20:16 00:40:28:04 Just see the magnificence,
the expansiveness,

408
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:47,310
00:40:28:04 00:40:32:07 the greatness of this
Kundalini which was within you

409
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:54,509
00:40:32:08 00:40:40:12 and which came up
in its full strength and has shown tremendous

410
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:55,839
things.

411
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,080
00:40:40:12 00:40:46:12 Such people are the
really great people

412
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:09,040
00:40:46:13 00:40:54:22 and not the people
who are trying to show off some sort of a

413
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,849
brand
00:40:54:22 00:41:01:24 cloth they wear, try

414
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:11,890
to show off, no.

415
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:18,680
All these silly ideas and stupidities
00:41:02:00 00:41:08:06 have to be given up

416
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:32,739
by Sahaja Yogis
00:41:08:07 00:41:21:22 so that this Kundalini

417
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:41,099
wears the beautiful flowers,
00:41:21:24 00:41:27:01 your words become

418
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:48,869
fragrant,
00:41:27:01 00:41:36:02 your glance becomes

419
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:56,650
soothing,
00:41:36:03 00:41:46:08 your smile becomes

420
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,950
satisfying.

421
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:03,411
Everything,
00:41:46:09 00:41:53:17 all your being, is

422
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:08,710
emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness,
peace --

423
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:12,630
00:41:53:18 00:41:57:24 above all, joy.

424
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,930
00:41:58:00 00:42:02:20 And the joy you feel
now - together

425
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,570
00:42:02:20 00:42:07:22 when we were yesterday
clapping and singing songs

426
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:27,720
00:42:07:24 00:42:12:14 and we were feeling
the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

427
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,839
00:42:12:15 00:42:19:20 without any drugs,
without any shouting, screaming, nothing — very

428
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,249
simple —
00:42:19:21 00:42:25:08 the joy we were feeling,

429
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:41,170
it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

430
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:47,539
00:42:25:09 00:42:30:22 She was so happy because
what were you asking there?

431
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:55,569
00:42:30:24 00:42:39:14 Nothing but the enjoyment
of collectivity.

432
00:42:55,569 --> 00:43:01,529
00:42:39:14 00:42:46:16 Collectivity doesn't
mean that we all should be stuck together

433
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:04,799
with some glue
00:42:46:17 00:42:53:20 or something or we

434
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:07,930
all become like Gibraltar, Rock of Gibraltar.

435
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:12,339
No,
00:42:53:21 00:42:59:07 it doesn't mean that.

436
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,500
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

437
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,069
00:42:59:08 00:43:05:03 That is collectivity.

438
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:26,390
A connected doesn't mean
00:43:05:04 00:43:10:10 that you hate that

439
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,390
person.

440
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,190
No,
00:43:10:10 00:43:14:15 you're connected means

441
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,490
you love that person,
00:43:14:16 00:43:18:04 you're concerned about

442
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,670
that person.

443
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:41,359
00:43:18:05 00:43:24:22 The connection, the
connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

444
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:48,180
00:43:24:24 00:43:31:05 So, when you are connected
with another person, or persons,

445
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:53,130
00:43:31:05 00:43:38:09 then you are in collectivity.

446
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,359
But people will live together
00:43:38:10 00:43:41:08 and everyday break

447
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:58,060
each other's heads.

448
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:03,499
00:43:41:08 00:43:46:11 Some of them really
give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes

449
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:08,130
00:43:46:12 00:43:54:24 because they are nowhere
near

450
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:14,859
00:43:55:00 00:43:57:15 the real growth of
Sahaja Yoga.

451
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:17,930
00:43:57:16 00:44:04:01 So you may be in America,
you may be in India,

452
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,130
00:44:04:02 00:44:06:05 you may be anywhere.

453
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:26,250
00:44:06:06 00:44:10:14 You are just connected.

454
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,519
And you are concerned.

455
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,359
00:44:10:15 00:44:13:16 As soon as there's
a problem somewhere,

456
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:38,479
00:44:13:16 00:44:21:22 into any part, any
part of the world, you are connected

457
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:42,529
00:44:21:22 00:44:25:13 and you're effective,
you can manage.

458
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:48,009
00:44:25:14 00:44:31:15 But if you are not
connected and you are just glued together,

459
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:53,559
00:44:31:16 00:44:37:12 it's very inconvenient
to live under such circumstances.

460
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,700
00:44:37:12 00:44:42:07 I think people don't
even understand the meaning of collectivity

461
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,999
00:44:42:08 00:44:46:16 where there's not
the other,

462
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:11,140
00:44:46:17 00:44:53:02 ananya, where there's
not the other, there's no other personality.

463
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:18,190
00:44:53:02 00:45:01:10 These personalities
are separated from you

464
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:24,269
00:45:01:11 00:45:06:12 because of left and
right or could be both.

465
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:29,690
00:45:06:13 00:45:12:19 But you are yourself
fully

466
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:33,140
00:45:12:20 00:45:16:22 when you're absolutely
detached

467
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,579
00:45:16:22 00:45:20:05 and your Kundalini
is dancing.

468
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:41,990
00:45:20:05 00:45:28:19 You're alone and never
alone.

469
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:53,160
00:45:28:19 00:45:40:13 This oneness with
the whole gives you all the security that

470
00:45:53,160 --> 00:46:01,450
you want,
00:45:40:13 00:45:46:02 all the joy you want

471
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:05,849
and that's why
00:45:46:02 00:45:51:19 Kundalini Awakening

472
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,410
means collectivity.

473
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:15,670
00:45:51:20 00:45:59:18 Unless and until you
want pure collectivity in your being,

474
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,480
00:45:59:18 00:46:03:19 Kundalini won't rise.

475
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,940
00:46:03:20 00:46:08:04 I feel sad sometimes
when people tell me,

476
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,950
00:46:08:05 00:46:15:05 "This gentleman is
like this, this lady's like this and she just

477
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,069
says things like that
00:46:15:06 00:46:21:16 and she tries to put

478
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:38,279
down her orders" or some man like that.

479
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:44,589
00:46:21:16 00:46:25:05 And I really can't
understand what are they doing here.

480
00:46:44,589 --> 00:46:47,950
00:46:25:05 00:46:29:13 We don't want Hitlers.

481
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:58,080
00:46:29:14 00:46:40:19 This attitude of ours,
so far has been on a different level,

482
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,140
00:46:40:19 00:46:44:17 like acquire more
money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

483
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,479
00:46:44:18 00:46:50:14 acquire more cars,
acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it

484
00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:09,479
is, children.

485
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:12,640
00:46:50:14 00:46:55:02 But the whole thing
changes in Sahaja Yoga.

486
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,140
00:46:55:03 00:47:00:13 You enjoy everything.

487
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:21,839
All right, this is your hall,
00:47:00:13 00:47:03:10 doesn't matter whosoever

488
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,109
it ... I am enjoying.

489
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:26,520
00:47:03:11 00:47:06:05 It's better not to
pay for it and enjoy

490
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,310
00:47:06:05 00:47:10:24 other people's money!

491
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:36,640
00:47:11:00 00:47:21:17 This carpet is not
mine, very good.

492
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,839
That's excellent.

493
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,250
It's beautiful, I'm enjoying.

494
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,869
00:47:21:18 00:47:28:09 Maybe the one who
will .. has got this, one must be worried

495
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,240
about something.

496
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:50,079
It might get spoiled
00:47:28:10 00:47:30:24 or some such thing,

497
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,690
but I'm enjoying.

498
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,630
00:47:30:24 00:47:38:20 So when this detachment
comes, really enjoy everything.

499
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,509
00:47:38:21 00:47:43:16 And in that detachment
only you enjoy others also

500
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:04,249
00:47:43:17 00:47:47:13 because you are really
so detached about it, don't want anything

501
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:05,249
with anyone.

502
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,420
00:47:47:13 00:47:50:13 Only person to person
you enjoy.

503
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:13,241
00:47:50:14 00:47:55:18 That means you enjoy
the spirit of another person

504
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:16,769
00:47:55:19 00:47:59:21 through your spirit,
Atmanya Atmanyat.

505
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:23,989
00:47:59:21 00:48:04:02 It is through the
spirit only you enjoy another's spirit.

506
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:29,430
00:48:04:03 00:48:11:19 And then the spirit
itself is, as you know,

507
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,499
00:48:11:20 00:48:13:18 is the source of knowledge.

508
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:42,690
00:48:13:19 00:48:21:12 The light of the spirit
is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness,

509
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:46,430
00:48:21:13 00:48:31:20 everything.

510
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,319
All that starts shining in through your faces.

511
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,839
00:48:31:20 00:48:34:01 I mean, from faces
you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

512
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,309
00:48:34:02 00:48:36:04 There's no need to
put hands and see.

513
00:48:53,309 --> 00:49:02,970
00:48:36:05 00:48:40:01 You know this is a
Sahaja Yogi, can't be anything else.

514
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:07,410
00:48:40:01 00:48:49:06 So the relationship
with the Adi Kundalini

515
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,019
00:48:49:07 00:48:54:07 is that it is the
reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

516
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:16,349
00:48:54:07 00:48:58:00 Now the reflection
— supposing

517
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:19,829
00:48:58:01 00:49:03:06 you take an Indian
mirror; you look in the mirror and you find

518
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:24,999
00:49:03:06 00:49:11:11 you look like nothing
on earth, it will just cut you into three

519
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:29,880
pieces, maybe, or anything.

520
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,529
00:49:11:12 00:49:15:21 But if you take a
Belgian mirror, say,

521
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:38,710
00:49:15:22 00:49:21:09 then the reflection
is correct, full --

522
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,839
00:49:21:10 00:49:24:07 but still not three
dimensional.

523
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:49,809
00:49:24:08 00:49:31:14 But this is a four
dimensional reflection — four dimensional,

524
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:54,700
00:49:31:15 00:49:35:02 what is called as
turya state.

525
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:01,590
00:49:35:02 00:49:43:00 And that four dimensional
personality

526
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:11,400
00:49:43:01 00:49:53:05 you have reflected
because of your reflector of your desire.

527
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:20,170
00:49:53:06 00:50:00:04 The reflector is the
desire and the reflection is complete.

528
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:28,749
00:50:00:05 00:50:09:07 So when you worship
the Adi Kundalini,

529
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:32,150
00:50:09:08 00:50:13:03 what you are trying
to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

530
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,920
00:50:13:04 00:50:15:21 as well as please
the Deities.

531
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:44,410
00:50:15:22 00:50:25:00 Because this is an
object, it is object, it is not to be changed

532
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,229
--
00:50:25:00 00:50:29:08 but the reflection

533
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:51,119
can change.

534
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:59,490
00:50:29:09 00:50:40:01 The movement of Kundalini
also depends

535
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,619
00:50:40:02 00:50:43:14 on the temperament
of the person,

536
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:08,950
00:50:43:15 00:50:49:21 what sort of a desire
he has for his Kundalini to rise.

537
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:13,589
00:50:49:22 00:50:55:21 First of all, there
are people who doubt.

538
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:14,589
They don't even believe there is Kundalini.

539
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:17,940
00:50:55:22 00:51:01:06 All right, even if
they believe, they say, "Oh, the air might

540
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,839
be coming out of something else."

541
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:25,930
00:51:01:07 00:51:08:00 They don't want to
believe.

542
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,680
So it's dishonesty.

543
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,869
00:51:08:01 00:51:16:00 Kundalini cannot give
you dishonesty.

544
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:42,019
00:51:16:01 00:51:19:09 It can give you honesty
and faith in honesty.

545
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:50,109
00:51:19:09 00:51:31:07 So she gives you faith
in goodness, faith in honesty,

546
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:58,249
00:51:31:07 00:51:37:04 not just by sermon
or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

547
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:03,619
00:51:37:05 00:51:42:01 but actually by actualizing
the experience.

548
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:18,322
00:51:42:02 00:52:00:09 Now, supposing you
want to go to the garden, supposing.

549
00:52:18,322 --> 00:52:20,890
00:52:00:10 00:52:03:17 Just you want to go
to the garden

550
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:27,609
00:52:03:17 00:52:07:06 and suddenly you find
in the garden.

551
00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:30,460
00:52:07:07 00:52:12:01 Then you will know
that your desire is pure.

552
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:31,460
That's why it has worked out.

553
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,039
00:52:12:02 00:52:14:15 "How am I in the garden?

554
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,349
00:52:14:16 00:52:17:22 Has garden walked
to me or I have walked into the garden?"

555
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:42,329
00:52:17:24 00:52:22:21 All such things go
on happening within you.

556
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:49,220
00:52:22:22 00:52:28:10 These are miracles,
as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga.

557
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,220
Is not that.

558
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,150
00:52:28:11 00:52:33:22 Is the pure desire
works it because it is powerful.

559
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,170
00:52:33:22 00:52:41:12 It just works it.

560
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:01,539
And when it works it, works the whole thing
out,

561
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,460
00:52:41:13 00:52:44:12 you develop that faith
within yourself.

562
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:15,039
00:52:44:13 00:52:55:10 So that faith, if
it is within you, nobody can challenge that

563
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:17,989
faith,
00:52:55:10 00:52:60:00 which is not a blind

564
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:22,309
faith but an open-eyes,
00:52:60:00 00:53:06:05 experienced faith

565
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:24,049
which is established within.

566
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:25,769
You cannot be challenged.

567
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:30,960
00:53:06:05 00:53:14:04 If you have the faith,
it will be done.

568
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,710
That's why
00:53:14:05 00:53:17:09 I always say don't

569
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:38,609
say even off-hand things
00:53:17:10 00:53:19:12 because you're Sahaja

570
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:39,680
Yogis, you are connected.

571
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:46,099
00:53:19:12 00:53:25:20 If you say, "Let that
plane be late," it will be.

572
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:49,289
00:53:25:21 00:53:28:22 There is no need to
say such things.

573
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:52,950
00:53:28:22 00:53:33:00 We have had so many
experiences like this.

574
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,489
00:53:33:01 00:53:34:12 I have been telling
Sahaja Yogis

575
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:59,910
00:53:34:13 00:53:39:14 not to say something
off-hand because you must know you are connected

576
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,910
now.

577
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,170
00:53:39:14 00:53:45:14 Your pure desire is
now being fulfilled

578
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:12,819
00:53:45:15 00:53:50:22 and you are now connected,
now you are divine, you are realized souls,

579
00:54:12,819 --> 00:54:15,150
00:53:50:22 00:53:57:22 you are very different
from others.

580
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,160
You can't imagine.

581
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,599
I can't talk like this to anyone.

582
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:26,500
00:53:57:22 00:54:09:04 Take any judge, for
example, even from France, I can't explain

583
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,020
anything to them or talk to them.

584
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,369
00:54:09:05 00:54:11:05 It's beyond their
mind.

585
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:36,380
00:54:11:06 00:54:16:07 But for you, all this
subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

586
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:42,829
00:54:16:07 00:54:19:10 because your Kundalini's
absorbing it.

587
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:50,160
00:54:19:10 00:54:29:12 Now, as it is, you
know I always perspire too much.

588
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,160
Why?

589
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,359
00:54:29:13 00:54:32:10 Because I go on absorbing
your heat.

590
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,960
00:54:32:11 00:54:35:06 I absorb so much that
I perspire.

591
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,829
00:54:35:07 00:54:39:17 So much, despite the
fact that you people are having a nice cool

592
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:05,969
breeze,
00:54:39:18 00:54:47:16 and I am feeling hot.

593
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,509
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

594
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:16,019
00:54:47:17 00:54:54:12 But whatever you absorb
is absorbed back by Me.

595
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:21,009
00:54:54:13 00:54:59:22 But that becomes like
a barometer.

596
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:24,170
00:54:59:24 00:55:03:07 Immediately you know,
"This is this.

597
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,170
This is done.

598
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:26,499
00:55:03:08 00:55:07:22 He's very hot.

599
00:55:26,499 --> 00:55:27,499
He's like this."

600
00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:33,190
00:55:07:22 00:55:13:03 You immediately know,
without even thinking, without for asking,

601
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:38,160
00:55:13:04 00:55:16:12 without any desires,
you know that this one is like that.

602
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,700
00:55:16:13 00:55:20:21 But the same fellow
will be quite friendly with others, is all

603
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,099
right,
00:55:20:22 00:55:22:15 but you just can't

604
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:45,019
stand it
00:55:22:15 00:55:24:24 because your Kundalini

605
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:46,969
is a barometer
00:55:24:24 00:55:29:09 and she tells you

606
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,299
what's wrong with others, with yourself.

607
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:52,540
00:55:29:10 00:55:35:05 Now, for example,
Agnya is a problem,

608
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,619
00:55:35:06 00:55:38:22 Agnya.

609
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:03,420
Everybody, "Agnya is a problem."

610
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,871
Agnya is a problem.

611
00:56:04,871 --> 00:56:05,871
00:55:38:22 00:55:42:11 "Yes, I am egoistical."

612
00:56:05,871 --> 00:56:07,140
00:55:42:12 00:55:45:20 No one says that means
that.

613
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:12,430
00:55:45:21 00:55:51:04 So you are the one
who can know about yourself

614
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:16,019
00:55:51:04 00:55:54:21 that is Self Knowledge
and also you can know about others

615
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:22,079
00:55:54:22 00:55:58:14 because of the Kundalini's
purity, is the reflector.

616
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:29,339
00:55:58:14 00:56:07:10 And the more you become
a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

617
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:35,550
00:56:07:10 00:56:14:19 So, for us it is important
to know

618
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:39,869
00:56:14:19 00:56:18:15 that our Kundalini's
awakened, that is the pure desire,

619
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,710
00:56:18:15 00:56:20:09 that's the pure mother
of us.

620
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,910
00:56:20:10 00:56:25:04 Each one has got a
separate mother, individual mother,

621
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:54,280
00:56:25:05 00:56:33:01 and that this Kundalini,
whichever we have our own separate,

622
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,079
00:56:33:01 00:56:36:09 different from others
in a way that she ..

623
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,550
00:56:36:10 00:56:41:20 her awareness about
us is different.

624
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:08,279
00:56:41:21 00:56:46:13 But, in her function,
in her methods,

625
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:14,150
00:56:46:14 00:56:50:17 she's just the same
in everyone.

626
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:21,029
00:56:50:18 00:56:59:14 She, she knows about
me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

627
00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:27,410
00:56:59:15 00:57:04:22 so she's different
in a way, in the knowledge,

628
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:32,769
00:57:04:22 00:57:10:04 but the way that she
works in everyone is just the same.

629
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:36,839
00:57:10:04 00:57:14:24 You wouldn't find
somebody's Kundalini in the stomach,

630
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:38,460
00:57:14:24 00:57:17:03 somebody's in the
throat.

631
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,640
00:57:17:03 00:57:19:22 It's in the same place
00:57:19:24 00:57:24:09 and it moves the same

632
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,640
way.

633
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,859
It cures the same way.

634
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:47,799
00:57:24:10 00:57:26:02 It works the same
way,

635
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:50,180
00:57:26:02 00:57:29:05 except that it has
the knowledge.

636
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:56,569
00:57:29:06 00:57:36:15 For example, if you
have two Mercedes cars, they work the same

637
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:58,450
way exactly the same.

638
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:03,769
00:57:36:16 00:57:42:14 But supposing if I
have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

639
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:09,769
00:57:42:15 00:57:47:04 then the road is circuitous,
so she has to go in a circuitous way.

640
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:12,299
00:57:47:04 00:57:50:11 But another Mercedes,
which has to go

641
00:58:12,299 --> 00:58:14,460
00:57:50:11 00:57:53:02 on a straight route,
it will go on a straight route.

642
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,670
00:57:53:02 00:57:55:13 But the working is
the same.

643
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:21,759
00:57:55:14 00:58:00:04 Only the knowledge
she has about you in particular

644
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:24,940
00:58:00:04 00:58:03:15 she knows you very
well out and out.

645
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,940
Remember this.

646
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,970
00:58:03:15 00:58:10:04 You cannot cheat her.

647
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,019
She knows you very well
00:58:10:05 00:58:14:10 and that is the reason

648
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:38,640
why today we are here
00:58:14:10 00:58:17:20 to worship our Kundalini,

649
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,269
to give her all the credit,
00:58:17:21 00:58:23:06 that "Oh, Mother,

650
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:45,380
she has given — You have given us these
great powers.

651
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:54,960
00:58:23:07 00:58:27:21 You have given us
this subtle knowledge within ourself.

652
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:02,640
00:58:27:21 00:58:40:11 You have given us
the love which encompasses the whole world"

653
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:09,619
00:58:40:12 00:58:52:07 And the more and the
more you become aware of her connections very,

654
00:59:09,619 --> 00:59:18,339
very delicate connections
00:58:52:08 00:58:58:22 then you'll be amazed.

655
00:59:18,339 --> 00:59:22,299
In one of my photographs which came out,
00:58:58:22 00:59:02:16 you must have seen

656
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:31,410
many, many lines going like that,
00:59:02:17 00:59:10:02 but very thin lines,

657
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,709
sharp, thin.

658
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:35,539
00:59:10:03 00:59:17:24 This is how we are.

659
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:39,709
Now we are all realized souls.

660
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:46,440
00:59:18:00 00:59:25:09 Only thing, if we
have to develop ourselves and grow, we have

661
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:52,190
to ask for,
00:59:25:10 00:59:32:06 desire for, something

662
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,619
very beautiful.

663
00:59:54,619 --> 00:59:59,499
00:59:32:07 00:59:37:05 But our attention
is moving on nonsensical things.

664
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:02,759
00:59:37:06 00:59:41:09 How will you grow?

665
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:27,680
00:59:41:09 00:59:44:24 That's why I said
we have to meditate

666
01:00:27,680 --> 01:01:17,569
00:59:45:00 00:59:48:01 so we get into thoughtless
awareness

667
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:28,999
00:59:48:02 00:59:54:12 by which we allow
the Kundalini to grow.

668
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:47,989
00:59:54:12 01:00:04:16 I hope after today's
program people will pay attention

669
01:01:47,989 --> 01:05:26,009
01:00:04:16 01:00:09:03 to their own Kundalini
and not to 

670
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:42,200
the defects of other people.

671
01:05:42,200 --> 01:06:36,420
01:00:09:04 01:00:11:17 First you must grow
01:00:11:17 01:00:16:19 and develop a personality

672
01:06:36,420 --> 01:09:37,850
of that compassion and 

673
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,520
love and everything.

674
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:53,900
01:00:16:20 01:00:22:18 Then only you'll be
amazed.

675
01:09:53,900 --> 01:10:02,180
01:00:22:19 01:00:35:13 You'll grow into something
really, a beautiful picture of perfection

676
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,469
as a human being.

677
01:10:04,469 --> 01:12:09,820
01:00:35:14 01:00:51:13 So may God bless you.

678
01:12:09,820 --> 01:14:20,890
01:00:51:13 01:00:55:11 I didn't want to 

679
01:14:20,890 --> 01:17:14,540
go into the details of the mathematics
01:00:55:12 01:00:59:06 of three and 

680
01:17:14,540 --> 01:24:53,160
a half and this and that and this — forget
it.

681
01:24:53,160 --> 01:25:42,660
01:00:59:06 01:01:07:08 There's no need to
deal with all those mathematical calculations

682
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:45,920
and things.

683
01:25:45,920 --> 01:26:02,230
01:01:07:08 01:01:11:02 There's no need.

684
01:26:02,230 --> 01:30:29,980
I mean it's the mathematics of love,
01:01:11:03 01:01:17:09 and what is 

685
01:30:29,980 --> 01:31:06,450
the mathematics of love?

686
01:31:06,450 --> 01:34:32,300
01:01:17:09 01:01:26:10 But I am writing a
book.

687
01:34:32,300 --> 01:35:15,970
If you want to know about it,
01:01:26:10 01:01:29:15 you can read it later

688
01:35:15,970 --> 01:36:24,830
on once you 

689
01:36:24,830 --> 01:41:44,500
have become something great,
01:01:29:16 01:01:35:02 then, otherwise it

690
01:41:44,500 --> 01:49:56,140
will go into your head again.

691
01:49:56,140 --> 01:56:05,520
01:01:35:02 01:01:43:15 Agnya is too much.

692
01:56:05,520 --> 02:07:25,070
What 

693
02:07:25,070 --> 02:08:54,030
is making you so very Agnya?

694
02:08:54,030 --> 02:10:08,810
01:01:43:15 01:02:15:08 Well, I didn't say
anything to hurt you, did I?

695
02:10:08,810 --> 02:10:19,070
01:02:15:09 01:02:22:13 Better?

696
02:10:19,070 --> 02:11:18,840
I think we all should put our finger to our
Agnya

697
02:11:18,840 --> 02:12:49,310
01:02:22:14 01:02:31:14 and move it a little.

698
02:12:49,310 --> 02:17:06,010
Here we 

699
02:17:06,010 --> 02:21:14,820
become really thoughtlessly aware
01:02:31:15 01:03:00:22 and detached.

700
02:21:14,820 --> 02:22:11,850
Move it slowly.

701
02:22:11,850 --> 03:02:33,150
Ah, better, much relaxed
