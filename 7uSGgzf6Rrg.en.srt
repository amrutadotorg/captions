00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:36,070
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

2
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,230
as well as your own Kundalini.

3
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:52,950
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

4
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,779
about your own Kundalini,

5
00:05:55,804 --> 00:06:00,214
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

6
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:07,102
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

7
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:15,728
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

8
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:20,978
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

9
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,444
but we do not know what purity means.

10
00:06:26,274 --> 00:06:29,269
It means your chaste desire.

11
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:38,526
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

12
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:45,632
That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone.

13
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,790
She’s your own mother.

14
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:51,394
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

15
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,171
She knows everything about you

16
00:06:54,777 --> 00:07:09,171
and she is absolutely the knowledge — because she’s so pure.

17
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:18,310
And, whatever chakras she touches,

18
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:24,279
she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

19
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:26,924
beforehand,

20
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:32,814
so she's quite prepared,

21
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:38,731
and she adjusts herself fully

22
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:46,771
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

23
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:52,771
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

24
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:59,811
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

25
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:11,135
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

26
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:15,308
and within you, in a human being,

27
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:24,045
it is like many strands of energy.

28
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,213
So it’s like a rope

29
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:37,047
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

30
00:08:38,906 --> 00:08:47,051
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

31
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,291
raised to power hundred and eight.

32
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:53,798
But when your Kundalini rises,

33
00:08:53,823 --> 00:09:00,599
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

34
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:02,209
Only one or two

35
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:11,383
because it has to pass through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

36
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,974
It’s all a spiral throughout

37
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:31,062
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

38
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:35,342
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

39
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:43,422
The outermost nadi is the right side

40
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:51,662
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

41
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:59,902
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

42
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:06,724
By that, they relax the center.

43
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:10,048
By the relaxation of the center,

44
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:17,782
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

45
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:23,659
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

46
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:28,142
then your eyes start relaxing,

47
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:31,062
your pupils start dilating

48
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:37,217
and your eyes can become like Mine,

49
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:40,902
very black, absolutely relaxed.

50
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:44,062
So, you can easily see in a person

51
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:49,377
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

52
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:53,662
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

53
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,742
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

54
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:05,158
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

55
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:09,982
love, compassion and attention.

56
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:20,586
All these three things are in that energy.

57
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,630
We know of many energies — like electrical energy,

58
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:30,280
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

59
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:37,153
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

60
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:40,776
they cannot work on their own.

61
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:46,822
They are to be handled by us.

62
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:52,417
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

63
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:56,220
and knows how to handle itself.

64
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,910
It thinks.

65
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:07,502
If you see a seed being sprouted,

66
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:12,868
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

67
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:18,342
which knows how to go around the soft places

68
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:25,262
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

69
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:32,862
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

70
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:34,902
the way it moves.

71
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:43,382
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

72
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:49,302
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

73
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:54,902
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

74
00:12:54,902 --> 00:13:01,622
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

75
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:08,182
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

76
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:16,062
When people get realization, they do not understand

77
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:21,262
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

78
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:25,502
Because they do not ask for these energies.

79
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:31,102
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

80
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:34,622
“I have to have more compassion.

81
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:38,502
My compassion is not all right.

82
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:44,102
My concern about others is not all right.

83
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:46,782
My generosity is not all right.

84
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:54,223
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love”,

85
00:13:54,705 --> 00:14:01,302
then this energy starts moving,

86
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:06,382
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

87
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:11,604
But, if you do not want to be

88
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:25,068
growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

89
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:28,742
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

90
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,877
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored within you.

91
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:40,300
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

92
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,365
raised to power hundred and eight.

93
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:47,933
So what a storage you have within yourself.

94
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:55,142
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

95
00:14:55,142 --> 00:15:03,102
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

96
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:08,373
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

97
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:13,369
or they would ask for money or something like that.

98
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:20,820
So these wants are not pure wants.

99
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:24,062
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

100
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:30,382
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

101
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:33,862
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

102
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:39,476
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you, to make you grow

103
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:48,262
by giving you a higher personality —

104
00:15:55,517 --> 00:16:00,982
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

105
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:09,182
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

106
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:11,582
then we think he is a higher personality.

107
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:15,622
Sometimes a person who is rich,

108
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:17,862
we think he is a higher personality.

109
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:23,542
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

110
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,502
is a higher personality.

111
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:33,182
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

112
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:40,302
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

113
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:43,382
we think he is a higher personality.

114
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:49,622
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

115
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:55,262
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

116
00:16:55,262 --> 00:17:01,262
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

117
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:04,942
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

118
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:14,342
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

119
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:20,622
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

120
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:27,261
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

121
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:32,338
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

122
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:42,794
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

123
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:49,262
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

124
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:56,934
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

125
00:17:57,081 --> 00:18:01,768
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

126
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,223
It has to have some protection,

127
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:10,042
some sort of a hardness outside.

128
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:17,043
Now, that hardness is there,

129
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:22,414
but the germ has a capacity to break that hardness.

130
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:27,815
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

131
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:30,531
which even if you touch it might break.

132
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:39,639
Can break a germ... can break the covering, the hard shell?

133
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:43,884
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

134
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:48,634
that such a hard shell,

135
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:53,742
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

136
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:57,653
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

137
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:05,143
So at that time, what happens

138
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:17,462
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

139
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:28,310
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

140
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:37,574
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

141
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:41,307
then the shell has to break.

142
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:47,568
In the same way, this Kundalini, which is a delicate thing —

143
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,742
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

144
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:56,302
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

145
00:19:57,218 --> 00:20:01,022
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

146
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:03,571
protectiveness for that person.

147
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:09,256
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.”

148
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:16,451
We always feel such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality

149
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:19,579
and that he should be protected.

150
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,582
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

151
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:30,182
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

152
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,961
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

153
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:38,102
That’s our concept, because we think

154
00:20:38,142 --> 00:20:42,593
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

155
00:20:45,022 --> 00:20:49,458
But just see that in a seed,

156
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:58,594
it is that delicate germ grows and breaks the shell.

157
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:03,262
In the same way,

158
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:14,862
when we become really delicate like a germ

159
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:26,582
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

160
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:32,060
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

161
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:35,537
then these shells will break.

162
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,700
But it’s the other way round, normally.

163
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:44,653
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders.

164
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:48,265
We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

165
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:53,246
Some of them came like tigers.

166
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,702
I didn’t know what to do to them.

167
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:03,062
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

168
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:11,382
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

169
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,702
So what we should ask for

170
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:27,062
is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature,

171
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:30,292
and then the Kundalini will supply

172
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:33,396
because she only has that.

173
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:40,177
Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

174
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:47,542
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

175
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:54,038
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

176
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,616
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

177
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:04,010
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

178
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:11,597
So what she says, “You hate someone, or you forgive…”

179
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,087
She gives you the power to forgive.

180
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:20,243
Like a sword has to fight a shield, not a sword.

181
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:27,539
So the violence, as they say, can only be fought with non-violence.

182
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:31,948
In the same way, if we have to grow,

183
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:34,762
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

184
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:39,066
we have to see how softly we talk,

185
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:43,552
how kindly we talk,

186
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,734
how considerate we are.

187
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:59,503
Now this is externally, but when you start doing that externally

188
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:03,008
the energy starts coming internally.

189
00:24:03,102 --> 00:24:05,674
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

190
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:09,628
So that’s our thinking. No, you’re thinking that time.

191
00:24:10,022 --> 00:24:14,462
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

192
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:17,097
because you’re asking her help.

193
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:23,874
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

194
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:26,737
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

195
00:24:27,307 --> 00:24:29,883
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

196
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:34,374
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

197
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:41,662
so how can she give you anger and temper.

198
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:49,205
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

199
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,136
How to get, I don’t know

200
00:24:56,083 --> 00:25:00,913
because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

201
00:25:00,938 --> 00:25:06,742
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

202
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:12,782
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

203
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:16,182
So please remember,

204
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:24,022
those who try to bring in assertions

205
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:28,016
and conditionings and ego

206
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:36,302
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

207
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:41,192
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

208
00:25:50,935 --> 00:26:00,902
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

209
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:08,090
holiness, chastity, self-respect,

210
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,971
pure love,

211
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:21,182
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

212
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,105
to give you joy,

213
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:34,080
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

214
00:26:36,706 --> 00:26:41,072
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

215
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:45,825
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

216
00:26:47,247 --> 00:26:54,767
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

217
00:26:55,954 --> 00:27:00,702
Supposing — I mean, I don’t know about modern mothers, but normally

218
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:08,582
if I would go and say to my mother,

219
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:11,742
“Teach me how to be angry,”

220
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:15,419
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

221
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:24,702
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

222
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:29,216
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

223
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,982
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

224
00:27:34,022 --> 00:27:37,311
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

225
00:27:40,224 --> 00:27:51,022
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

226
00:27:53,587 --> 00:27:58,942
make a very big problem for Kundalini

227
00:27:58,982 --> 00:28:01,409
to enter into your attention.

228
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,462
Now, people always ask,

229
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:07,062
“Mother, how are we to grow?

230
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,830
What should we do?”

231
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:13,041
That’s why I say introspection.

232
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,294
There should be introspection.

233
00:28:18,395 --> 00:28:21,254
“What do I want in this life?

234
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:26,942
I should be able to love many more people

235
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:29,966
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

236
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:34,081
All right.

237
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:45,064
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

238
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:58,462
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

239
00:28:59,129 --> 00:29:02,262
How many things she has to give you

240
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:05,254
by which

241
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:11,370
you become so powerful,

242
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,899
so very powerful.

243
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,718
No one can trouble you.

244
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,586
She gives you security.

245
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:56,282
She gives you peace.

246
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,909
She gives you wisdom.

247
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:12,542
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

248
00:30:12,582 --> 00:30:16,542
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

249
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:23,995
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

250
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:35,690
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

251
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:41,720
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

252
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,902
you jump on the left or the right side.

253
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:49,896
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

254
00:30:51,903 --> 00:30:54,693
then you can become anything.

255
00:30:55,674 --> 00:31:01,872
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

256
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:06,731
and all these things start coming in very easily

257
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:13,330
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

258
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,278
Because you move on that side —

259
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,868
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

260
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,984
You want diseases, have them.

261
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:28,942
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

262
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:31,966
Whatever you want, you can have it.

263
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,892
Also, that is available.

264
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:38,349
Nobody can stop you.

265
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:41,982
You want to be sly,

266
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:47,182
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

267
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:49,182
This is also very common.

268
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,858
I’ve heard that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

269
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:56,102
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

270
00:31:56,142 --> 00:31:59,062
This is how we can never grow.

271
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:04,022
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

272
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:08,942
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

273
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:16,495
These things are not going to help us.

274
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:22,454
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage,

275
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:28,105
to build them more churches or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

276
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,047
had enough of problems.

277
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:37,070
So now we want to make for ourselves

278
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:40,836
abode of love and purity,

279
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,687
but those who are residents are not,

280
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:46,782
then how can you have love?

281
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,462
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things there.

282
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:59,422
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

283
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:11,102
we have to understand that this light spreads in your life,

284
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:16,582
outside your life and expresses itself

285
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,582
in a very, very beautiful manner.

286
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:25,817
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis look very different from others.

287
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:30,982
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

288
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:36,772
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

289
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:40,462
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

290
00:33:40,462 --> 00:33:45,009
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

291
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:49,190
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

292
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,685
They’re quite surprised how could you be so sensible, so many of you.

293
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,950
So many people if they gather anywhere,

294
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,740
they can go amok in no time.

295
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,110
I mean, even a smaller group

296
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,969
can become mad.

297
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,859
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

298
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:21,022
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

299
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:25,101
by those simple village people.

300
00:34:29,254 --> 00:34:33,840
For that, you have to just desire.

301
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,418
You just have to desire

302
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,350
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

303
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,150
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

304
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,830
You want money? All right, have it.

305
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,689
Move to the right side.

306
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:53,510
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

307
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:59,100
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

308
00:35:00,404 --> 00:35:04,798
You can get many people who will go and kill anybody they want to.

309
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:08,720
Then you want some publicity or something.

310
00:35:08,745 --> 00:35:11,083
All right, get to the right side.

311
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:20,166
All these things can happen,

312
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:22,310
whatever you want

313
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:26,849
according to the movement that you have.

314
00:35:29,138 --> 00:35:31,461
But for ascent,

315
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:39,377
your desire should be pure desire

316
00:35:41,483 --> 00:35:46,649
to get to that greater personality

317
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:59,017
of love and beautiful relationships.

318
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:05,334
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

319
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,538
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

320
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:19,092
Now, you have to find out

321
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:24,977
what are we doing as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

322
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,390
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

323
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:41,441
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

324
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:45,270
Also the Deities feel happy.

325
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,950
In that happy mood, you can achieve

326
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,750
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

327
00:36:55,589 --> 00:37:00,448
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate,

328
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:04,040
otherwise all these strands will go back, slip down,

329
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:07,785
which have come out in the puja.

330
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:13,350
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

331
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:20,292
But you should understand that,

332
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,349
‘what do we get in this puja?’.

333
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:31,230
You come here – desire for that higher life.

334
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:39,790
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

335
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:42,750
If you want, you can do it.

336
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,800
It's again a question of your wanting.

337
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:49,470
So throughout it is ‘want’.

338
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,671
What is your desire?

339
00:37:57,435 --> 00:38:04,148
We have desire like ‘children’.

340
00:38:04,912 --> 00:38:07,493
Some people want to have children.

341
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,011
After the children are born, then they say,

342
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:16,630
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

343
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:23,734
Then you want to have money

344
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,123
and most of those money people are now in jail.

345
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,983
Then you want to have fame.

346
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:48,467
The fame of the people never helps them,

347
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:58,515
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

348
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:01,679
If fame was such a good thing,

349
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,751
why should people be jealous?

350
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:15,918
So the power of Kundalini,

351
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:18,941
which is your own mother,

352
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:27,992
which has to... which has to rise, which has to come up,

353
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:31,001
which has to manifest itself,

354
00:39:31,917 --> 00:39:35,833
because of your pure desire.

355
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:42,270
So in your introspection, in your pujas, in your meditation,

356
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:48,453
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

357
00:39:48,824 --> 00:39:53,270
it is for pure desire of compassion

358
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:56,484
and love to be awakened within us –

359
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,314
you are already in the meditation,

360
00:40:01,604 --> 00:40:05,213
you're already growing, the growth has started.

361
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:08,983
And you'll grow so fast that this shell,

362
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:13,833
which is this human conditioning and egos will just break open.

363
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:18,910
And then this small little thing

364
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:22,122
which is only in the triangular bone —

365
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:27,307
imagine in a... there’s a very little space in the triangular bone —

366
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:31,947
that it comes out and manifests

367
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,000
and can save the whole world.

368
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,937
Just see

369
00:40:38,386 --> 00:40:43,068
the magnificence, the expansiveness,

370
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:47,412
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

371
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,467
and which came up in its full strength

372
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:55,235
and has shown tremendous things.

373
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:01,405
Such people are the really great people

374
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:07,928
and not the people who are trying to show off

375
00:41:07,953 --> 00:41:13,217
some sort of a brand cloth they wear, try to show off, no.

376
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,633
All these silly ideas and stupidities

377
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:20,663
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

378
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:37,790
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

379
00:41:38,827 --> 00:41:42,383
your words become fragrant,

380
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:51,266
your glance becomes soothing,

381
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:58,354
your smile becomes satisfying.

382
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:03,199
Everything, all your being,

383
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:09,705
is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

384
00:42:10,187 --> 00:42:12,565
above all, joy.

385
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:18,666
And the joy you feel now — together

386
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,950
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

387
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:28,575
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

388
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:33,922
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing —

389
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:35,761
very simple —

390
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:41,267
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

391
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:47,443
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

392
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:55,630
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

393
00:42:57,296 --> 00:43:02,710
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

394
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,690
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

395
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,302
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

396
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:15,714
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

397
00:43:17,144 --> 00:43:19,050
That is collectivity.

398
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:27,219
A connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No,

399
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:31,069
you’re connected means you love that person,

400
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,902
you’re concerned about that person.

401
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:41,733
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

402
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:48,006
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

403
00:43:49,613 --> 00:43:52,659
then you are in collectivity.

404
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:58,037
But people will live together and everyday break each other’s heads.

405
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:05,187
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes because

406
00:44:08,102 --> 00:44:14,148
they are nowhere near the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

407
00:44:15,938 --> 00:44:20,890
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

408
00:44:20,915 --> 00:44:22,841
you may be anywhere.

409
00:44:23,129 --> 00:44:25,062
You are just connected.

410
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,905
And you are concerned.

411
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,856
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

412
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:35,576
into any part, any part of the world,

413
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,590
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

414
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,670
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

415
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:54,426
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

416
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:59,350
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

417
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:03,269
where there’s not the other,

418
00:45:03,294 --> 00:45:06,721
ananya, where there’s not the other,

419
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,974
there’s no other personality.

420
00:45:12,926 --> 00:45:18,396
These personalities are separated from you

421
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:23,461
because of left and right or could be both.

422
00:45:27,122 --> 00:45:30,176
But you are yourself fully

423
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,950
when you’re absolutely detached

424
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,270
and your Kundalini is dancing.

425
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,481
You're alone and never alone.

426
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:50,965
This oneness with the whole

427
00:45:52,728 --> 00:45:57,490
gives you all the security that you want,

428
00:45:57,515 --> 00:45:59,458
all the joy you want

429
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:08,340
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

430
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:17,051
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

431
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,133
Kundalini won't rise.

432
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,744
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

433
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:29,624
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this

434
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:32,619
and she just says things like that

435
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:38,977
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

436
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:42,711
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

437
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:47,438
We don’t want Hitlers.

438
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:58,511
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

439
00:46:58,536 --> 00:47:02,750
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

440
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:08,264
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

441
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,150
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,498
You enjoy everything.

443
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:18,165
All right, this is your hall,

444
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:21,218
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

445
00:47:21,243 --> 00:47:24,003
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

446
00:47:26,623 --> 00:47:28,738
other people’s money!

447
00:47:33,419 --> 00:47:37,042
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent.

448
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:39,794
It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

449
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:45,070
Maybe the one who has got this, one must be worried about something.

450
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:48,582
It might get spoiled or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

451
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:56,392
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

452
00:47:57,846 --> 00:48:01,418
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

453
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:05,298
because you are so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

454
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:08,298
Only person to person you enjoy.

455
00:48:09,396 --> 00:48:13,712
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

456
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:17,618
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

457
00:48:17,618 --> 00:48:22,194
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

458
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:29,538
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

459
00:48:29,578 --> 00:48:32,022
is the source of knowledge.

460
00:48:33,037 --> 00:48:40,309
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness, everything.

461
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,578
All that starts shining in through your faces.

462
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,949
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

463
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:54,199
There’s no need to put hands and see.

464
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:58,560
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

465
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,033
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

466
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:13,058
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

467
00:49:14,542 --> 00:49:18,440
Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror;

468
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:24,965
you look in the mirror and you find you look like nothing on earth,

469
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:30,218
it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

470
00:49:31,755 --> 00:49:34,618
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

471
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:39,720
then the reflection is correct, full –

472
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:43,058
but still not three dimensional.

473
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:48,777
But this is a four dimensional reflection —

474
00:49:48,802 --> 00:49:54,096
four dimensional, what is called as turya state.

475
00:49:55,176 --> 00:50:01,778
And that four dimensional personality

476
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:11,978
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

477
00:50:13,354 --> 00:50:19,366
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

478
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:28,739
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

479
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:32,724
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

480
00:50:32,749 --> 00:50:35,429
as well as please the Deities.

481
00:50:37,432 --> 00:50:40,461
Because this is an object,

482
00:50:41,051 --> 00:50:44,667
it is object, it is not to be changed –

483
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:48,026
but the reflection can change.

484
00:50:55,764 --> 00:50:59,818
The movement of Kundalini also depends

485
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:02,892
on the temperament of the person,

486
00:51:04,316 --> 00:51:09,223
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

487
00:51:09,503 --> 00:51:12,391
First of all, there are people who doubt.

488
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:15,446
They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

489
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:17,460
All right, even if they believe, they say,

490
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:20,947
“Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

491
00:51:21,901 --> 00:51:23,875
They don’t want to believe.

492
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,739
So it’s dishonesty.

493
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:35,778
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

494
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:39,138
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

495
00:51:45,744 --> 00:51:51,058
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

496
00:51:51,058 --> 00:51:56,938
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

497
00:51:57,883 --> 00:52:02,194
but actually by actualizing the experience.

498
00:52:03,484 --> 00:52:05,894
Now, supposing

499
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:13,661
you want

500
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:20,325
to go to the garden, supposing.

501
00:52:20,919 --> 00:52:23,458
Just you want to go to the garden

502
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:27,018
and suddenly you find in the garden.

503
00:52:28,195 --> 00:52:31,720
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

504
00:52:31,745 --> 00:52:33,870
“How am I in the garden?

505
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,658
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

506
00:52:39,401 --> 00:52:42,618
All such things go on happening within you.

507
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:48,635
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

508
00:52:48,718 --> 00:52:53,658
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

509
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:56,280
It just works it.

510
00:52:58,868 --> 00:53:02,000
And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

511
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:04,557
you develop that faith within yourself.

512
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:09,773
So that faith, if it is within you,

513
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:15,826
nobody can challenge that faith,

514
00:53:16,732 --> 00:53:20,285
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

515
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:26,741
experienced faith which is established within you — cannot be challenged.

516
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:30,529
If you have the faith, it will be done.

517
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:37,771
That’s why I always say don’t say even off-hand things

518
00:53:37,796 --> 00:53:40,266
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

519
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:46,165
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

520
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:50,240
There is no need to say such things.

521
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:53,257
We have had so many experiences like this.

522
00:53:53,282 --> 00:53:57,054
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis not to say something off-hand

523
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:00,040
because you must know you are connected now.

524
00:54:00,893 --> 00:54:06,262
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

525
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:09,379
and you are now connected, now you are divine,

526
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:12,528
you are realized souls,

527
00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:16,705
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine.

528
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:18,930
I can't talk like this to anyone.

529
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,721
Take any judge, for example, even from France,

530
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:29,979
I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

531
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:32,004
It’s beyond their mind.

532
00:54:32,029 --> 00:54:37,069
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

533
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,491
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

534
00:54:44,767 --> 00:54:50,818
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

535
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:53,723
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

536
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,404
I absorb so much that I perspire.

537
00:54:56,429 --> 00:55:01,053
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

538
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,139
and I am feeling hot.

539
00:55:05,556 --> 00:55:08,908
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

540
00:55:10,626 --> 00:55:16,050
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

541
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:21,207
But that becomes like a barometer.

542
00:55:21,232 --> 00:55:24,581
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

543
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:29,052
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

544
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:34,547
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

545
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:37,892
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

546
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:42,226
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

547
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:46,206
but you just can’t stand it because your Kundalini is a barometer

548
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:50,631
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

549
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:57,208
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem, Agnya.

550
00:55:57,255 --> 00:56:00,658
Everybody, “Mother, Agnya is a problem. Agnya is a problem.”

551
00:56:01,498 --> 00:56:03,870
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

552
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:07,289
No one says that — means that.

553
00:56:08,706 --> 00:56:13,983
So you are the one who can know about yourself that is Self Knowledge

554
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:16,492
and also you can know about others

555
00:56:16,517 --> 00:56:20,197
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

556
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:29,178
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

557
00:56:33,141 --> 00:56:36,538
So, for us it is important to know

558
00:56:36,538 --> 00:56:40,378
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

559
00:56:40,378 --> 00:56:42,138
that’s the pure mother of us.

560
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:46,938
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

561
00:56:46,978 --> 00:56:54,818
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

562
00:56:54,818 --> 00:56:58,138
different from others in a way that she...

563
00:56:58,178 --> 00:57:03,578
her awareness about us is different.

564
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:08,298
But, in her function, in her methods,

565
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:11,876
she’s just the same in everyone.

566
00:57:16,053 --> 00:57:21,338
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

567
00:57:21,378 --> 00:57:26,149
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

568
00:57:26,658 --> 00:57:31,938
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

569
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:36,738
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

570
00:57:36,763 --> 00:57:38,923
somebody’s in the throat.

571
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,738
It’s in the same place

572
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:46,138
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

573
00:57:46,178 --> 00:57:47,858
It works the same way,

574
00:57:47,858 --> 00:57:50,978
except that it has the knowledge.

575
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,935
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars,

576
00:57:55,535 --> 00:57:58,880
they work the same way — exactly the same.

577
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:04,814
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

578
00:58:04,853 --> 00:58:09,048
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

579
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:13,344
But another Mercedes, which has to go on a straight route,

580
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:14,972
it will go on a straight route.

581
00:58:14,997 --> 00:58:17,298
But the working is the same.

582
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:22,317
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

583
00:58:22,342 --> 00:58:26,036
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

584
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,739
You cannot cheat her.

585
00:58:30,524 --> 00:58:32,825
She knows you very well

586
00:58:33,692 --> 00:58:36,789
and that is the reason why today we are here

587
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:40,208
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

588
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:45,741
that “Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.

589
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:50,270
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

590
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:53,210
You have

591
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:02,415
given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

592
00:59:03,564 --> 00:59:11,690
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections —

593
00:59:11,784 --> 00:59:14,921
very, very delicate connections —

594
00:59:17,005 --> 00:59:20,633
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

595
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:24,714
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

596
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:29,387
but very thin lines,

597
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:32,662
sharp, thin.

598
00:59:33,714 --> 00:59:35,950
This is how we are.

599
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,940
Now we are all realized souls.

600
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:46,042
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow,

601
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:50,231
we have to ask for, desire for,

602
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:54,536
something very beautiful.

603
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,978
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

604
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:01,140
How will you grow?

605
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:07,693
That's why I said we have to meditate

606
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:10,771
so we get into thoughtless awareness

607
01:00:10,804 --> 01:00:16,627
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

608
01:00:21,426 --> 01:00:25,667
I hope after today's program

609
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:29,192
people will pay attention to their own Kundalini

610
01:00:29,217 --> 01:00:32,285
and not to the defects of other people.

611
01:00:32,415 --> 01:00:34,618
First you must grow

612
01:00:34,786 --> 01:00:39,866
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

613
01:00:41,715 --> 01:00:46,498
Then only you’ll be amazed.

614
01:00:47,707 --> 01:00:50,805
You’ll grow into something really,

615
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:57,842
a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

616
01:01:01,123 --> 01:01:03,834
So may God bless you.

617
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:18,965
I didn’t want to go into the details of the mathematics

618
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:22,299
of three and a half and this and that and this — forget it.

619
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:29,899
There’s no need to deal with all those mathematical calculations and things.

620
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:31,492
There’s no need.

621
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:35,841
I mean it’s the mathematics of love,
and what is the mathematics of love?

622
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:45,198
But I am writing a book,

623
01:01:45,941 --> 01:01:50,607
if you want to know about it, you can read it later on

624
01:01:50,632 --> 01:01:52,825
once you have become something great, then,

625
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:55,174
otherwise it will go into your head again.

626
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:02,491
Agnya is too much.

627
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:07,390
What is making you so very Agnya?

628
01:02:09,052 --> 01:02:12,221
I didn't say anything to hurt you, did I?

629
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,709
Better?

630
01:02:42,583 --> 01:02:45,639
I think we all should put our finger to our Agnya

631
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:47,498
and move it a little.

632
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:57,457
Here we become really thoughtlessly aware and detached.

633
01:03:02,701 --> 01:03:04,323
Move it slowly.

634
01:03:20,265 --> 01:03:23,667
Ah, better, much relaxed.
