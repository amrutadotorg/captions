00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.040
Before we start celebrating the birth of Christ,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.360
we have to little bit review what we have done after His Birth,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.040
so that we understand where we stand in relation to Him.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.440
For He was the Son of a Virgin

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.720
so that even the slightest blot on His name

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.320
should not be created.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:57.000
Because He was to do the greatest job,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.200
of creating for us Agnya awareness,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.440
which would help us to suck in all our sins,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.680
all our conditionings, and all our egos.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.480
And the great personality

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.680
was created for such a great work within ourselves.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.320
For us divine laws are binding because we know

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.640
that is the only way one can rise.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.760
It is not compulsion,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.160
but voluntary acceptance that we have to rise,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.080
that we have to be alright,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.920
there are no conditionings in Sahaja Yoga

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.320
but this is how we improve,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.640
this is how we go further,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.600
so we accept the situation, and we move forward with it.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.280
That is why realization should give you that strength to fight

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.920
anti-Christ activity within your mind.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.240
You have to face yourself, is the point I am saying.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.880
Not only that you have to face yourself,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.320
but you have to face the so-called society that is around you,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.720
and see for yourself that these conditionings

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:43.960
and these anti-Christ activities into which you have indulged

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.160
are completely detrimental to your growth, and to your ascent.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.480
And as you are special people who have got realization,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.120
you have to argue it out with yourself and reach proper conclusions.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.320
No use arguing out with others.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.560
As you know with the conditioning,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.440
people get quiet, they do not talk,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.480
but the conditioning is growing inside.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.680
With the ego people talk too much

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.720
and they aggress others with their talking

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.000
and the ego is growing too much.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.960
So one has to be in the witness state,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.560
that means wherever you have to talk, you have to talk

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.560
and wherever you have to keep quiet, you have to keep quiet.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.360
This is at the Vishuddhi level.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.960
At the Agnya level, you have to detest

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.440
all that is ugly, all that is unholy, all that is filth.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.160
Because now a new sensitivity has developed within you.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.560
And a new sensitivity to Holiness, to auspiciousness.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.360
Try to improve this auspiciousness within you.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:18.280
I find people get very easily attached to negative people.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.040
They get identified with negative people, very common.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.520
And they think that they are being sympathetic.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.360
It is the sympathy they are working.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.200
So I have to tell you one thing that

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.560
to have your ego problems settled,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.600
first of all see, that you are not playing to your ego.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.800
And also, see your conditioning which are now bhoots,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.320
all these conditionings have become bhoots in you.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.520
All the Church bhoots have got into your heads.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.760
They are all there. So you must see that these bhoots are not there,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.400
because we have to be holy. We have to be clean.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.520
We have to be resurrected.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.080
We are resurrected people.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.000
Christ has resurrected us.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.520
But you have to think how much he has to work for us.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.920
The more you try to be in unison with negativity,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.000
we harm him more, we torture him more, we trouble him more.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.720
The one who was born in the manger

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.640
in the most difficult circumstances,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.520
where everybody requires comfort,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.440
who from the very beginning

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.360
went through hazardous life till His death.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.760
His birth itself, you can see, was in a cow-shed.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.320
None of you are born in a cow-shed.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.800
And while the Christians are so particular about comforts,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.560
most surprising is, why Christ was born in a cow-shed?

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.600
In a very very cold night Christ was born.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.520
Nothing much to cover; sparkling beauty it was.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:37.480
Now we have to keep him within ourselves comfortably.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:46.280
We are not going to give Him that manger in our Agnya Chakra.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.920
Manger of thoughts and a crown of thoughts.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.400
That we are not going to give Him.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.520
We are going to make Him comfortable

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.760
by not accepting negativity as a sympathy.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:13.280
You have to be kind towards your auspiciousness and holiness

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:22.680
so that Christ enjoys His stay there in your Agnya.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:34.160
That we do not torture Him by our useless ideas,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.800
uncomfortable behaviors,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.480
inauspicious appearances

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.160
and unholy acceptance of wrong ideas.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.720
Try to respect Him. There He stands.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.920
Try to make Him very comfortable.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.720
I wish I could do that, but He resides in everybody’s Agnya Chakra.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.200
If He was only in my Agnya,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.720
I would have given Him the greatest comforts,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.880
but he wants to be manifested in everybody’s Agnya.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.280
So I have to request you as a Mother to look after Him,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.040
give Him a nice cradle,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.440
give Him a comfortable time,

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.600
because He is born to give you your resurrection.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.520
He has taken up such a great responsibility

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.920
to suck all your conditioning and to suck all your ego,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.520
but that does not mean that you put stones on top of it.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.240
Today is the great day of holiness.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.120
Let us celebrate the birth of Christ in our Agnya Chakra

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.680
and let us sing praise of it so that He in His pure essence,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.880
in his holy body, He should be there,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.240
And in purity you respect him.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.720
Absolutely purity because He is purity.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.200
Now you may say that Mother if He is pure purity

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.600
– there are some stupid people who ask me –

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.240
“if He is purity, then how can we make him impure?”

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.320
What I mean, if you do not respect Him,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.600
why will He be there? He will disappear.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.000
He likes purity. He will disappear from there.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.200
He is not good for you.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.360
So better create a cradle,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.960
a beautiful cradle, of love, of honesty,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.800
as His Mother prepared for Him.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.720
With all sweetness and kindness and assurance

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.800
that you will nurture the beauty and the auspiciousness of Christ.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.080
May God bless you all.
