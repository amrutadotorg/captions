00:07.360 --> 00:13.040
Before we start celebrating the birth of Christ,

00:13.960 --> 00:20.360
we have to little bit review what we have done after His Birth,

00:20.520 --> 00:26.040
so that we understand where we stand in relation to Him.

00:26.400 --> 00:33.440
For He was the Son of a Virgin

00:37.240 --> 00:43.720
so that even the slightest blot on His name

00:43.880 --> 00:47.320
should not be created.

00:47.920 --> 00:57.000
Because He was to do the greatest job,

00:57.160 --> 01:03.200
of creating for us Agnya awareness,

01:03.360 --> 01:08.440
which would help us to suck in all our sins,

01:08.600 --> 01:13.680
all our conditionings, and all our egos.

01:13.840 --> 01:19.480
And the great personality

01:19.640 --> 01:25.680
was created for such a great work within ourselves.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.320
For us divine laws are binding because we know

01:30.480 --> 01:33.640
that is the only way one can rise.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.760
It is not compulsion,

01:38.560 --> 01:43.160
but voluntary acceptance that we have to rise,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.080
that we have to be alright,

01:45.240 --> 01:47.920
there are no conditionings in Sahaja Yoga

01:48.080 --> 01:50.320
but this is how we improve,

01:50.480 --> 01:52.640
this is how we go further,

01:52.800 --> 01:57.600
so we accept the situation, and we move forward with it.

01:57.760 --> 02:05.280
That is why realization should give you that strength to fight

02:07.400 --> 02:12.920
anti-Christ activity within your mind.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.240
You have to face yourself, is the point I am saying.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.880
Not only that you have to face yourself,

02:21.040 --> 02:26.320
but you have to face the so-called society that is around you,

02:27.480 --> 02:34.720
and see for yourself that these conditionings

02:34.880 --> 02:43.960
and these anti-Christ activities into which you have indulged

02:44.280 --> 02:51.160
are completely detrimental to your growth, and to your ascent.

02:51.320 --> 02:58.480
And as you are special people who have got realization,

02:58.640 --> 03:03.120
you have to argue it out with yourself and reach proper conclusions.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.320
No use arguing out with others.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.560
As you know with the conditioning,

03:09.720 --> 03:12.440
people get quiet, they do not talk,

03:12.600 --> 03:16.480
but the conditioning is growing inside.

03:16.640 --> 03:20.680
With the ego people talk too much

03:20.840 --> 03:23.720
and they aggress others with their talking

03:23.880 --> 03:27.000
and the ego is growing too much.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.960
So one has to be in the witness state,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.560
that means wherever you have to talk, you have to talk

03:32.720 --> 03:36.560
and wherever you have to keep quiet, you have to keep quiet.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.360
This is at the Vishuddhi level.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.960
At the Agnya level, you have to detest

03:45.440 --> 03:53.440
all that is ugly, all that is unholy, all that is filth.

03:53.880 --> 03:59.160
Because now a new sensitivity has developed within you.

03:59.320 --> 04:04.560
And a new sensitivity to Holiness, to auspiciousness.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.360
Try to improve this auspiciousness within you.

04:10.520 --> 04:18.280
I find people get very easily attached to negative people.

04:18.440 --> 04:23.040
They get identified with negative people, very common.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.520
And they think that they are being sympathetic.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.360
It is the sympathy they are working.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.200
So I have to tell you one thing that

04:32.400 --> 04:35.560
to have your ego problems settled,

04:35.720 --> 04:42.600
first of all see, that you are not playing to your ego.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.800
And also, see your conditioning which are now bhoots,

04:47.960 --> 04:51.320
all these conditionings have become bhoots in you.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.520
All the Church bhoots have got into your heads.

04:54.680 --> 04:59.760
They are all there. So you must see that these bhoots are not there,

04:59.920 --> 05:04.400
because we have to be holy. We have to be clean.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.520
We have to be resurrected.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.080
We are resurrected people.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.000
Christ has resurrected us.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.520
But you have to think how much he has to work for us.

05:15.680 --> 05:22.920
The more you try to be in unison with negativity,

05:23.080 --> 05:28.000
we harm him more, we torture him more, we trouble him more.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.720
The one who was born in the manger

05:31.880 --> 05:35.640
in the most difficult circumstances,

05:36.440 --> 05:42.520
where everybody requires comfort,

05:42.920 --> 05:46.440
who from the very beginning

05:46.600 --> 05:51.360
went through hazardous life till His death.

05:51.520 --> 05:58.760
His birth itself, you can see, was in a cow-shed.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.320
None of you are born in a cow-shed.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.800
And while the Christians are so particular about comforts,

06:07.960 --> 06:13.560
most surprising is, why Christ was born in a cow-shed?

06:14.840 --> 06:20.600
In a very very cold night Christ was born.

06:20.800 --> 06:27.520
Nothing much to cover; sparkling beauty it was.

06:29.200 --> 06:37.480
Now we have to keep him within ourselves comfortably.

06:37.640 --> 06:46.280
We are not going to give Him that manger in our Agnya Chakra.

06:46.440 --> 06:53.920
Manger of thoughts and a crown of thoughts.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.400
That we are not going to give Him.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.520
We are going to make Him comfortable

06:59.680 --> 07:04.760
by not accepting negativity as a sympathy.

07:04.920 --> 07:13.280
You have to be kind towards your auspiciousness and holiness

07:13.440 --> 07:22.680
so that Christ enjoys His stay there in your Agnya.

07:22.840 --> 07:34.160
That we do not torture Him by our useless ideas,

07:34.320 --> 07:37.800
uncomfortable behaviors,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.480
inauspicious appearances

07:41.640 --> 07:48.160
and unholy acceptance of wrong ideas.

07:48.320 --> 07:53.720
Try to respect Him. There He stands.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.920
Try to make Him very comfortable.

08:00.120 --> 08:05.720
I wish I could do that, but He resides in everybody’s Agnya Chakra.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.200
If He was only in my Agnya,

08:08.360 --> 08:11.720
I would have given Him the greatest comforts,

08:11.880 --> 08:16.880
but he wants to be manifested in everybody’s Agnya.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.280
So I have to request you as a Mother to look after Him,

08:21.440 --> 08:25.040
give Him a nice cradle,

08:25.200 --> 08:28.440
give Him a comfortable time,

08:28.600 --> 08:32.600
because He is born to give you your resurrection.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.520
He has taken up such a great responsibility

08:35.680 --> 08:40.920
to suck all your conditioning and to suck all your ego,

08:41.080 --> 08:46.520
but that does not mean that you put stones on top of it.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.240
Today is the great day of holiness.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.120
Let us celebrate the birth of Christ in our Agnya Chakra

08:52.280 --> 08:58.680
and let us sing praise of it so that He in His pure essence,

08:58.840 --> 09:01.880
in his holy body, He should be there,

09:02.040 --> 09:05.240
And in purity you respect him.

09:05.400 --> 09:10.720
Absolutely purity because He is purity.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.200
Now you may say that Mother if He is pure purity

09:13.360 --> 09:16.600
– there are some stupid people who ask me –

09:16.760 --> 09:20.240
“if He is purity, then how can we make him impure?”

09:20.400 --> 09:23.320
What I mean, if you do not respect Him,

09:23.480 --> 09:25.600
why will He be there? He will disappear.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.000
He likes purity. He will disappear from there.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.200
He is not good for you.

09:32.360 --> 09:35.360
So better create a cradle,

09:35.520 --> 09:40.960
a beautiful cradle, of love, of honesty,

09:41.120 --> 09:44.800
as His Mother prepared for Him.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.720
With all sweetness and kindness and assurance

09:49.880 --> 09:56.800
that you will nurture the beauty and the auspiciousness of Christ.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.080
May God bless you all.
