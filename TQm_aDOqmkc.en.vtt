WEBVTT

09:08.757 --> 09:12.457
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

09:16.877 --> 09:24.537
At the very outset we'll have to know one thing that truth is what it is.

09:26.357 --> 09:32.837
We cannot organize it, we cannot conceptualize it

09:34.237 --> 09:39.597
moreover unfortunately, we cannot know it

09:40.017 --> 09:42.957
at human awareness.

09:45.277 --> 09:52.577
I'm very thankful to you Sir for inviting Me to speak to young academic people here

09:54.977 --> 10:01.457
about, as you wrote to Me that you would like to know about every type of religion.

10:01.977 --> 10:07.917
At the very outset I have to say that all religions

10:09.317 --> 10:13.097
were created by Incarnations, prophets -

10:15.597 --> 10:22.617
were like flowers on one tree of life. When people plucked it,

10:24.017 --> 10:31.457
took away the dead flowers with them, then they started calling this is mine, this is mine, this is mine.

10:31.917 --> 10:36.037
And that's why you do not see how they are integrated

10:36.277 --> 10:41.477
and how they are absolutely from the one tree of Spirituality.

10:45.237 --> 10:52.357
But one thing is common to all of them, is said that

10:53.737 --> 11:00.877
you have to know yourself, "Know thyself." Also it is called

11:03.177 --> 11:11.237
as in the Buddhist tradition or say the Christian tradition that you are to be born again - even Hindu tradition.

11:12.317 --> 11:17.957
'You are to be born again.' Specially in India,

11:18.497 --> 11:22.457
the word used for a person who is a realized soul,

11:23.197 --> 11:29.137
who knows this All-Pervading power, is called as Dwijah, means twice born

11:29.397 --> 11:35.977
and also a bird is called as dwijah, means it, it is first in the form of an egg

11:36.617 --> 11:42.937
and then it becomes a bird in it's one lifetime. In the same way, a dwijah

11:44.917 --> 11:51.437
the one who is a Self-realized person, is first born as a closed personality

11:52.957 --> 11:59.697
later on becomes a personality which is one with the All-Pervading Divine Power.

12:01.417 --> 12:04.357
Now whatever I'm telling you here -

12:05.917 --> 12:11.897
you are after all students and teachers and professors, academic people -

12:13.557 --> 12:20.777
you have to take it as a scientist would look at it, with an open mind and if it proves

12:22.737 --> 12:27.317
alright, then you have to accept it as honest people

12:27.977 --> 12:34.977
because you're very important people, I should say, you are cream of the nation and if you understand this

12:37.957 --> 12:45.597
as a hypothesis and later on find out whether it is true or not, then it is going to help

12:46.557 --> 12:50.017
in a much wider way than anything else.

12:56.617 --> 13:02.217
Now the principle of getting realization

13:02.997 --> 13:10.657
or getting the second birth is not yet very well described

13:11.277 --> 13:17.997
into full texts in these scriptures because, I think, the people were not ready.

13:18.637 --> 13:24.757
But in the Indian scriptures in Sanskrit language there are 108 Upnishadas

13:25.537 --> 13:33.257
which have talked about the Brahma Vidya meaning the knowledge of the All-Pervading power.

13:34.397 --> 13:39.917
Of course everywhere it is said that there is an All-Pervading power of Divine love

13:40.677 --> 13:48.357
but nobody has even described that and also they have talked of the Holy Ghost but nobody has described that either.

13:49.517 --> 13:54.837
Now, how we proceed with

13:55.457 --> 14:00.437
this research is this way that first of all

14:01.017 --> 14:06.097
whatever I'm telling you, you have to see if it works in you or not.

14:08.137 --> 14:16.117
'Sahaja' means spontaneous. 'Saha' means with, 'Ja' means born, 'Yoga' means the union with the Divine power.

14:18.177 --> 14:25.277
This is a spontaneous happening because it is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

14:25.677 --> 14:29.737
We have become human-beings and there is still a little

14:31.637 --> 14:39.397
journey we have to do for this last breakthrough, where we get Absolute knowledge and Absolute truth.

14:40.557 --> 14:46.157
Because we are in darkness and in ignorance about it

14:47.017 --> 14:54.637
that's why there are so many problems, that's why we are suffering, that's why we do not know how to relate to each other

14:55.257 --> 15:00.677
in a truthful manner. First of all we have to discover the truth

15:02.257 --> 15:10.317
and the truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, this mind

15:11.397 --> 15:16.417
this ego, this conditionings - no - you're the pure Spirit.

15:17.117 --> 15:24.977
You have to achieve that state. You have to achieve - again I say, actualization, is the becoming, is not just certificate that, "I'm the Spirit," -

15:25.237 --> 15:28.197
it's not that, you have to become.

15:29.897 --> 15:34.817
So that is the one great fundamental truth about us

15:35.217 --> 15:39.737
that we are all are the pure Spirit which we have to become

15:41.317 --> 15:47.297
and the second one is that there is this All-Pervading power around us

15:48.357 --> 15:52.517
which does all living work including our evolution.

15:53.057 --> 15:57.897
For example, if you see these flowers here, beautiful flowers

16:00.117 --> 16:07.097
and when you see them you never even think that they have come out of one seed

16:07.737 --> 16:11.557
which was just sprouted by the Mother Earth - you take them for granted.

16:12.917 --> 16:18.777
All living work you take for granted. You take your body for granted, your eyes which are wonderful

16:18.997 --> 16:24.557
cameras, I think your mind is wonderful computer, all you take it for granted

16:24.797 --> 16:30.997
but how it was made, who made it - you never go into the inquiry of it because it's a living process.

16:32.497 --> 16:38.557
In the same way, we did not know how, with what force we became human beings.

16:39.217 --> 16:46.537
Now, within us lies this force which will take us to this last journey, to this last breakthrough

16:47.417 --> 16:51.757
and that is here shown in the triangular bone

16:53.357 --> 16:58.957
which is called Sacrum. It's interesting to know that the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone

16:59.517 --> 17:03.937
that's why they called it a Sacrum and they called the

17:05.457 --> 17:12.597
fontanel bone as fontanne, means there's a fountain - that means they knew about the realization.

17:13.057 --> 17:18.217
Also Athena word -'Ath' in Sanskrit means also in their language means Primordial

17:19.857 --> 17:25.577
So She's the Primordial Mother - they accept that there was a Primordial Mother

17:25.977 --> 17:32.297
but in some religions they have avoided the talk of the Primordial Mother. They said the Father,

17:32.757 --> 17:38.617
the Son and no talk of the Mother. Might be because of some reasons but

17:39.137 --> 17:45.417
how can you have a Father and a Son and not the Mother? So the feminine energy

17:45.717 --> 17:49.957
which is reflected within us, is this Kundalini -

17:50.537 --> 17:58.457
is called Kundalini because it is coiled up - Kundal means a coil. I'm sorry you all can't see it -

18:02.417 --> 18:07.457
no? Can you bring it? Somebody should hold it that's all.

18:08.757 --> 18:15.477
Here you can keep it, it be better. Now? Better.

18:22.017 --> 18:29.697
This is the one coiled up in three and a half coils. That's a mathematical thing

18:29.957 --> 18:32.977
which you will know later on but it is here

18:33.317 --> 18:38.857
and now there are seven centers, as you see, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven centers

18:40.497 --> 18:46.637
altogether, one below the Sacrum and the rest of them are above the Sacrum.

18:47.657 --> 18:54.637
This one is in the brain on the optic chiasma and this one is the limbic area - actually this one is here

18:54.897 --> 18:59.177
and this is the limbic area with the last seventh center.

19:00.697 --> 19:08.617
These are subtle centers and they look after our plexuses on the physical side but they also

19:09.357 --> 19:15.977
are responsible for our mental, physical, emotional and spiritual being,

19:16.337 --> 19:20.417
so what happens that when we start using these centers

19:21.197 --> 19:27.457
on the left and the right - now the left one, this one, the left one is the

19:28.317 --> 19:35.957
energy of your desire, which Freud has called as psyche or things but is much more than that -

19:36.897 --> 19:43.477
this is the power of your desire and all your subconscious mind is placed on this.

19:44.957 --> 19:49.497
And this is the power of action which

19:52.177 --> 19:59.157
is looking after your all actions and this is also nourishing

19:59.577 --> 20:05.277
your physical and mental being. This looks after your emotional being.

20:05.617 --> 20:12.477
So all your futuristic ideas are on that side or you can say the Supra-conscious and the Collective Subconscious on that side.

20:14.137 --> 20:21.017
Hume got his realization, no doubt and he said that when you get your realization, you have to have

20:21.517 --> 20:27.317
Collective Consciousness - a new awareness - that really happens in sahaja yoga because he got it also.

20:28.237 --> 20:34.737
But, I think, he made a mistake when he placed the Subconscious

20:35.017 --> 20:39.917
and the Unconscious and all that in horizontal lines

20:41.057 --> 20:45.677
because, after all, the Creator is a very great planner also.

20:46.297 --> 20:52.497
You have seen the periodic laws in the Chemistry how beautifully He has planned out everything -

20:52.757 --> 20:58.777
there has to be some brain behind it, so how will He place it one after another like this horizontal?

20:59.137 --> 21:06.097
If you have to ascend, what He has done, is to put them vertically, both of these - is the future on that side

21:06.297 --> 21:10.077
and the past on this side and the present here.

21:10.577 --> 21:17.917
In the medical uh..  terminology, we can say, that this looks after the Right Sympathetic, this looks after the Left Sympathetic

21:18.137 --> 21:23.517
and this is the Parasympathetic Nervous system. That is when we

21:24.097 --> 21:29.697
uh.. put in some effort for some emergency. Supposing, you have to run

21:30.437 --> 21:33.777
then you use your Sympathetic Nervous system on this side

21:35.597 --> 21:43.477
or if you are crying and you're feeling very depressed and all that, then you are using the Left Sympathetic. [UNCLEAR - YOU CAN USE IT?]

21:44.037 --> 21:48.077
but when you're running, the heart pulsates very fast

21:48.317 --> 21:55.197
but how does it come to normal, is only through the Parasympathetic activity which brings it to normal.

21:55.457 --> 21:59.157
Doctors have not reached upto Parasympathetic - they are very honest about it.

22:01.737 --> 22:06.757
These are the centers which are formed, like this, left and right - see

22:07.017 --> 22:11.637
this is how the centers were, left and right - so two centers make one center

22:11.937 --> 22:18.397
Now supposing, you start using this center too much, then it starts getting exhausted and smaller and smaller

22:18.817 --> 22:25.237
but sometimes something can happen, it will just break and when it breaks then what happens

22:25.477 --> 22:32.357
you develop diseases of a Psychosomatic nature which are incurable but this Kundalini when She rises

22:32.597 --> 22:37.297
she pierces through all of them and binds them together,

22:38.517 --> 22:42.557
nourishes them and ultimately connects you

22:42.797 --> 22:49.077
to the All-Pervading power - as this is connected to the mains, that's why we can use it otherwise it is useless.

22:49.357 --> 22:55.077
So we all have to be connected to the mains then you will understand the

22:55.737 --> 22:59.897
integration of all the religions, of all the Incarnations.

23:01.897 --> 23:08.517
All these days we had political problems, of course we have economic also but

23:09.037 --> 23:15.677
I think, we are threatened with one big problem, is fundamentalism or fanaticism.

23:16.477 --> 23:21.737
This comes because of our ignorance and that is why

23:22.157 --> 23:27.557
you have to have a complete realization of yourself

23:28.377 --> 23:36.097
and in the light of your Spirit you can see very clearly that all these religions are -

23:36.597 --> 23:40.297
these are the milestones of our evolution

23:40.577 --> 23:46.797
and all these great people appeared on these centers - they created these centers

23:50.917 --> 23:56.737
to propound a religion. At the beginning every religion was just the same.

23:57.117 --> 24:03.657
Like in Christian religion Thomas, who was travelling from, from uh..

24:04.217 --> 24:10.157
Egypt to India, has left some treatise written in a jar

24:10.757 --> 24:15.697
which were discovered about 48-50 years back and have been now decoded

24:15.997 --> 24:19.817
and it's all they're talking about this experience of sahaja yoga

24:20.117 --> 24:24.857
and about vibrations and all - there's a very nice book on that called as Gnostics.

24:25.357 --> 24:32.617
Now they were called as Gnostics, the people who were realized souls, so 'Gn'. 'Gn' word comes from Sanskrit 'Gn', "Gn' means the knowledge.

24:32.897 --> 24:39.897
Now the idea of knowledge we think is mental, is a mental feat - it is not. If knowledge

24:40.017 --> 24:46.017
was mental, then there would have been no problem. Because everybody thinks differently

24:46.297 --> 24:53.517
everyone thinks, they're so self-opiniated, everyone thinks our religion is the best. I mean, you ask anyone, you ask a Jew, he'll say,

24:53.857 --> 25:00.837
"All others are not chosen ones, we are going to go  Heaven," everybody believes like that. You ask Muslims they'll say the same, Hindus will say the same,

25:01.077 --> 25:06.277
Christians will say the same. But all of them are quite capable of committing any sin they want to.

25:06.557 --> 25:13.977
We should face the reality as it is. Why if they profess a religion, why should they not

25:14.277 --> 25:19.757
be practising it compulsorily? But because they're professing it from your mind,

25:20.557 --> 25:26.877
it's not working out in their being. To work it out in their being, they have to have

25:27.177 --> 25:33.077
connection with this All-Pervading power which gives them the pure knowledge and

25:33.797 --> 25:39.617
a personality which we can call as universal personality

25:39.857 --> 25:46.357
because Spirit is the Universal being within us in our heart - is the reflection of the God Almighty.

25:47.477 --> 25:52.297
And this Spirit when it comes into our attention, it becomes

25:53.817 --> 26:01.617
such a light within us, that the light of the attention itself acts.

26:03.157 --> 26:10.917
For example, any such person who has evolved to that state, can just put attention to something and can work out wonders.

26:11.437 --> 26:14.877
Even a glance of such a person can be very purifying

26:16.877 --> 26:24.817
but that you have to develop after you have established your relations with this All-Pervading power.

26:26.977 --> 26:31.717
It is remarkable how after coming to sahajayoga

26:32.997 --> 26:39.437
the first time I met seven hippies in England. They were all professors like you

26:39.897 --> 26:44.417
and, and they were, [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

26:44.677 --> 26:51.317
uh.., uh.. lawyers and doctors, very capable people, all of them, seven of them -

26:52.217 --> 26:59.017
two were French, two French ladies and I asked them,

26:59.317 --> 27:05.957
"Why are you taking all these things?" He said, "No, no we, this is all in seeking we're doing." They were quite convinced about their own achievements

27:06.677 --> 27:12.757
but once they got their realization, overnight they gave up all their drugs about which they were

27:13.077 --> 27:19.697
on My head that drug is very important - overnight they wouldn't take it. Now what happened actually

27:20.457 --> 27:28.377
that - I give a simile always which is very simple to understand - that if you have a snake in your hand

27:28.957 --> 27:35.297
and it's all darkness, you cannot see it and you're very obstinate, somebody tells you, "It's a snake," [UNCLEAR] "No, it's a rope

27:35.817 --> 27:40.657
and it's not a snake," till the snake bites you you're not going to leave it. So

27:42.117 --> 27:47.677
when the light comes in, even a little bit, you see the snake, you just drop it.

27:48.137 --> 27:51.117
In the same way it has happened with these people

27:51.397 --> 27:57.417
and as I know I always say that they're very hard nuts to crack - these English are - but once they're cracked,

27:57.777 --> 28:00.797
they are tremendous people.

28:01.017 --> 28:08.317
Then they went into all their scholarships, found everything about the Kundalini everything and today they are one the foundations of sahaja yoga.

28:09.777 --> 28:16.277
So, I have to tell you that this power is your own,

28:16.557 --> 28:24.157
She's actually your mother, individual mother and She has got everything recorded about you within Herself

28:24.597 --> 28:30.917
and She is your own energy. She has to just rise and

28:31.277 --> 28:37.097
get you connected with this All-pervading power, then you realize how great you are!

28:38.217 --> 28:46.037
Just now we feel so frustrated about ourselves. We don't know what is the purpose of our life, why are we here -

28:46.537 --> 28:53.877
I mean, I meet young people who are really very frustrated and they do all kinds of things out of frustration but there is nothing to frustrate

28:54.437 --> 29:01.297
because once you get this realization, gradually you start feeling

29:01.937 --> 29:07.537
your Divinity within yourself, your greatness within yourself but the

29:08.637 --> 29:16.177
immediate effect is that, you start feeling the cool breeze in, on your fingertips, start feeling cool breeze

29:16.377 --> 29:21.137
blowing out of your head and when you want to use

29:24.817 --> 29:29.917
this power, you are amazed to find out

29:30.797 --> 29:37.617
how tremendously powerful person you are! You can give realizations to people,

29:38.037 --> 29:43.117
you can raise their Kundalini - no saints, so far, did that, I must tell you.

29:43.717 --> 29:48.737
Nobody could do because the time was not such. Today the time is very special

29:48.997 --> 29:55.937
when this All-Pervading power has become extremely dynamic. We call it, now Kaliyuga is

29:56.497 --> 30:01.997
in parallel growing with Kritayuga - means where it is working out,

30:07.477 --> 30:13.417
where it is working out and when it starts working, this

30:14.957 --> 30:20.877
Kritayuga is so effective and so dynamic

30:21.437 --> 30:28.157
that I've seen thousands get realization. First time when I went to Russia -

30:29.457 --> 30:37.357
they had never seen Me, they don't know anything about Me, nothing - they just saw My photograph. I must say, there's one thing about Russians

30:37.697 --> 30:44.997
they're very introspective people, extremely introspective. Anything they want to do, even if they have to do a hair-do

30:45.197 --> 30:52.797
they'll think, "Why should I do, what is the need?" Anything they do it, they introspect it, "What is the need to do this?"

30:53.077 --> 30:58.857
Even if they fall in love, they first of all see and then fall whether she should, they should fall or not?

30:59.097 --> 31:06.817
So they're extremely introspective by nature and their style of life you can see from the way Tolstoy has written and

31:07.077 --> 31:14.917
other books like 'Crime and Punishment' - throughout - they're extremely introspective. Even the, even the hero and heroines of theirs

31:15.177 --> 31:20.457
pictures, if you see the films, they too are extremely introspective, is a

31:20.697 --> 31:28.737
different type of uh.. uh...category, I think, of their uh.. personality that they always introspect.

31:29.397 --> 31:34.737
But they saw My photograph, just with My photograph and not even photograph, it's a

31:35.017 --> 31:39.457
posters, you won't believe, we have 16000 people

31:39.817 --> 31:46.457
thrice and we had to arrange stadiums for them and they all got realization.

31:47.177 --> 31:54.457
And forty doctor, I'm sorry four hundred doctors are practising sahaja yoga there

31:54.997 --> 32:02.497
out of which forty are in Moscow itself and there are two hundred scientist who are practising sahaja yoga.

32:03.457 --> 32:10.097
The Ministry of Education has written beautiful letter to Me and Ministry of Agriculture wants

32:10.337 --> 32:17.337
us to show the experiments with sahaja yoga. I thought they're so open-minded also, they're not conditioned at all by anything.

32:17.657 --> 32:22.977
They're such simple people and such clean people -

32:23.257 --> 32:31.257
their administration might have been bad, their government might have been bad, whatever it is but I think they had lot of time

32:32.017 --> 32:38.337
and they could think about all those things which are inside us

32:38.537 --> 32:45.797
or perhaps, like in India we have very good climate all the time so people didn't have to fight the nature so much

32:46.017 --> 32:50.197
so they went to the jungles and forests and meditated and tried to find out

32:50.437 --> 32:54.377
what is the way out, out of this human bondage.

32:56.417 --> 33:03.117
This is very much seen there in Russia where there is no talk of God, no talk of religion,

33:03.377 --> 33:10.557
no talk of Spirit. But to Me they did not challenge it and the best part of it

33:10.857 --> 33:15.377
the way the love is expressed in sahaja yoga was best seen

33:15.617 --> 33:21.837
when about twenty German sahaja yogis rushed to Russia to give them realization

33:22.217 --> 33:27.877
and they were so gentle, so kind you can't believe they come from the same [UNCLEAR] -

33:28.157 --> 33:33.597
nothing, extremely gentle, so soft-spoken

33:34.217 --> 33:42.257
they gave them realization, they worked there, they stayed there, they worked very hard and they told Me that, "Mother, it was very necessary

33:42.857 --> 33:47.297
for us to come here for what our forefathers have done."

33:49.857 --> 33:54.277
Such love, such understanding, I've never seen anybody

33:54.577 --> 33:58.957
going into discussions, arguments even if they are five thousand together

33:59.157 --> 34:04.437
I've never seen them discuss, discussing something. Like in India we have a seminar

34:04.797 --> 34:10.757
where there are people - this time were from fifty-five countries. Of course we have centers in forty-five

34:11.017 --> 34:18.617
but there were people from from all Eastern Bloc and everywhere and such understanding and love

34:19.337 --> 34:24.157
and pure love. There's no problem of this woman running with that man - nothing of the kind.

34:25.297 --> 34:33.057
They're so innocent and so pure, I never had such problems in sahaja yoga. If somebody carried on with this thing he just

34:33.277 --> 34:36.417
goes out of sahaja yoga very easily - no problems.

34:37.017 --> 34:41.697
So, I would say that this new race of people, sort of, are created.

34:42.037 --> 34:49.157
They respect every religion. You'll be surprised we have got Jews, many Jews in sahaja yoga -even in Israel we have a center.

34:49.377 --> 34:54.897
They all respect Christ as even Christians would not respect.

34:56.377 --> 35:04.017
We have Muslims, we have some Muslims here also. They all respect Shri Krishna as much as they would respect

35:04.277 --> 35:10.697
Mohammad Sahab and there are many Hindus here who got angry with [UNCLEAR]

35:10.937 --> 35:16.037
this fellow who published things against Mohammad Sahab.

35:17.077 --> 35:24.897
[UNCLEAR - SALMARASHTI?]  so angry with him, they couldn't bear it because we all know he was

35:25.097 --> 35:28.077
one of the Incarnations of the Primordial master.

35:28.297 --> 35:35.597
He has said that, "At the time of resurrection  your hands will speak," and this is exactly what is happening in sahaja yoga.

35:37.097 --> 35:44.097
The another thing that happens to you, apart from that you know the Absolute knowledge and Absolute

35:44.857 --> 35:52.357
love within yourself. Still, there's one more thing happens to you, that you don't feel you're doing anything

35:52.597 --> 36:00.217
you just feel, it's done. You talk in third person - it's done, it's going. It's in a third person you start talking.

36:01.557 --> 36:06.077
People ask Me how's it I travel every third day at this age of Mine;

36:06.297 --> 36:11.617
I don't feel tired because I don't travel, I don't know, I'm just sitting there, I'm just, never feel that way, I never think about it.

36:11.997 --> 36:18.997
Because you reach a state, in the beginning only which we call as thoughtless awareness, Nirvichar samadhi

36:19.357 --> 36:25.477
where you become thoughtless, means there is no future, there's no past but you stand in the present

36:26.657 --> 36:34.317
and in that state you start growing. When you're thoughtless, you just feel the abstract joy of everything.

36:34.737 --> 36:41.637
You do not think about it, don't waste energies on thinking but you get inspirations of very highest quality,

36:42.157 --> 36:47.517
you get so dynamic, [ASIDE - IT'S ALL RIGHT], very dynamic with your creativity.

36:47.857 --> 36:55.237
There are now musicians who have come here uh... to Australia just to express their

36:55.697 --> 37:03.417
feeling of gratitude because they got their realization and they became very great musicians. There are many great musicians today in India -

37:03.737 --> 37:09.817
one of them had been here Jalota, who got his realization now - he's a very great musician, very well known,

37:10.197 --> 37:17.357
Amjad Ali, so many of them are there. They may be Muslims, Hindus, anything - they all get the blessings of their own Self

37:17.677 --> 37:23.837
and they become great musician. Then we have students who were very dull students

37:23.977 --> 37:30.457
they were brought to us - now they're earning all the scholarships, bagging all of them and some students

37:30.677 --> 37:38.057
have, who got realization have got through very difficult examinations, in India, in record time

37:38.397 --> 37:41.377
because when the Kundalini comes into your head

37:42.177 --> 37:49.637
you start using much more part of your brain than you normally use and you really become extremely intelligent

37:49.957 --> 37:54.777
but this intelligence has a capacity to cheat itself - it does not.

37:55.137 --> 38:00.317
It doesn't like to cheat; It becomes a righteous intelligence, becomes

38:00.597 --> 38:05.977
an intelligence which tells you what is benevolent for you and benevolent for other.

38:06.337 --> 38:10.977
So the sahaja yoga is now the

38:11.657 --> 38:16.757
stage where human-beings have to reach. This transformation is going

38:16.977 --> 38:23.317
to solve the problems because if you see basically all our problems come because of human-beings

38:23.817 --> 38:30.937
but if you're transformed all your problems will be solved. Ecological problem comes because we have no balance.

38:31.997 --> 38:39.337
With this you develop a balance. Because of balance you know how far to go with any production,

38:39.557 --> 38:45.137
with any consumption and the whole economic laws settle down into a beautiful balance.

38:46.397 --> 38:53.537
All problems that you face today are only because of the ego of human-beings or their conditionings.

38:53.917 --> 39:00.557
If you can get rid of it, then you become a pure personality, you become part and parcel of the whole

39:00.757 --> 39:07.117
and you become a global personality and that's how you can solve global problems.

39:07.377 --> 39:15.437
See, in this time I would like because you're academics who're here, academicians, you to ask Me some questions - would be good idea.

39:15.677 --> 39:21.817
I, I think in this little time I cannot elaborately tell you all about it but I've got

39:22.097 --> 39:29.837
I think, three thousand or four thousand tapes of Mine, only in English language, which you can see later on and find out about it

39:30.217 --> 39:38.077
but just now, I think, I have told you whatever was possible in this short time. I would like you

39:38.377 --> 39:45.017
to ask Me some questions which are relevant with it because I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician,

39:45.337 --> 39:51.217
I'm not here to take any money from you, nothing of the kind - I'm just telling you the key.

39:51.537 --> 39:59.517
Whatever was not so far told in the Scriptures, I'm going to tell you and this will prove that all the scriptures are correct,

39:59.897 --> 40:07.017
all these Incarnations were correct and also prove that there is God Almighty Who is looking after us.

40:08.737 --> 40:15.217
It is said that there is some moment [UNCLEAR] about your future and and your past.

40:15.637 --> 40:22.517
and [UNCLEAR] You said nothing

40:22.777 --> 40:26.937
[UNCLEAR]

40:27.477 --> 40:31.197
[UNCLEAR]

40:31.357 --> 40:39.037
He says, "If at this moment of realization we cut off ourselves from the past and the future are we then nothing?"

40:39.237 --> 40:45.937
Ha, ha, that's what you think. Actually, you do not, you cannot cut off. Try - you cannot, can you?

40:47.117 --> 40:55.077
- [UNCLEAR]
- No. What happens actually, when this happening takes place then you rise

40:56.637 --> 41:03.877
like, I would say, like this, your attention starts rising like this and it pulls out, your attention is pulled out from the sides

41:04.137 --> 41:10.577
and you go in the center. Now [UNCLEAR -AS OR IF?] you know, past doesn't exist and -

41:11.057 --> 41:17.277
because it finished now and future also doesn't exist.

41:17.597 --> 41:22.557
What exists is the present and we always miss the present which is existing

41:23.317 --> 41:28.617
- Show at the moment present exists.
- Every moment, every moment, every moment.

41:29.037 --> 41:33.757
Now see, now I've seen you today, alright. Listen to Me, listen to Me,

41:34.297 --> 41:42.177
listen Me. As human-beings only, I'm a human-being too, I'll, I'm - just listen to Me, one minute, one minute, one. minute -

41:42.757 --> 41:50.457
You see, I'm looking at you, alright now. Now I've seen you once. Once I've seen you at this moment

41:50.997 --> 41:58.897
- listen Me - I've seen you. Anytime, this moment, I can again

41:59.437 --> 42:05.817
picturize completely - how you were sitting, what dress you're wearing - it's like a picture

42:06.577 --> 42:14.897
when you know how to live in the present. You take a photograph - can you take a photograph of the past or the future? You cannot

42:15.137 --> 42:21.937
of the present only - so the whole thing become completely known to you. Your memory becomes tremendous.

42:22.997 --> 42:29.337
You don't live in the past, you don't live but you know - it's the whole library in your head

42:29.857 --> 42:36.237
that anything that you have seen, anything you have known, is just recorded there - you don't forget anything.

42:36.477 --> 42:42.357
- [UNCLEAR]
- Beg your pardon?
- What you said before, when You said that [UNCLEAR]

42:42.577 --> 42:50.197
You didn't hear Me properly. I think, you are thinking about yourself that might be the reason. I didn't say that, I said you stand in the present

42:50.477 --> 42:54.337
I say that, I never say cut off, I said you stand in the present.

42:54.657 --> 43:01.077
Now try to open your head little bit and try to understand what I'm trying to say because this is going to help you very much.

43:11.997 --> 43:18.797
From the time we're born to the time that we're now [UNCLEAR] must realize that

43:19.897 --> 43:27.457
we could see and get a lot of people and [UNCLEAR]

43:28.117 --> 43:33.437
that I don't think in the decorative

43:33.657 --> 43:37.317
in it's quicker way [UNCLEAR] Can You explain that more?

43:37.557 --> 43:44.277
Yes it looks quite fantastic, I know but supposing you are in the water, deep waters

43:44.677 --> 43:51.497
and you are seeing the waves coming on you, then you are afraid of the waves but supposing by some chance

43:51.717 --> 43:57.577
you're taken up in a boat, then you see at that little time

43:58.097 --> 44:06.117
you see the waves alright but you're not afraid of them but supposing you learn how to swim, then you can jump back

44:06.757 --> 44:13.097
and can save other people. It's like that, is your human

44:14.117 --> 44:22.077
personality expands in that manner so that you become a witness of the whole thing

44:23.257 --> 44:28.177
and then you can solve the problem much better. You can say, as a wheel is moving

44:28.677 --> 44:36.477
but the axis of the wheel is absolutely silent. If you are in the wheel, then you are worried and upset and hurt

44:36.817 --> 44:41.417
but if you are at the point, at the axis, then

44:42.137 --> 44:46.257
you see the wheel moving but you are at standstill.

44:46.737 --> 44:52.837
It's a state in which you have to go. I understand at human level as it is from birth to death

44:53.037 --> 44:59.757
we do not see this say, we get hurt and people hurt you, we also hurt others without knowing

44:59.997 --> 45:06.617
that we are hurting others but when you are at the axis, you never hurt others

45:07.197 --> 45:12.777
nor others can hurt you because you never get the hurt - you're beyond them.

45:13.677 --> 45:16.757
Now I have to answer you, now what is it?

45:16.997 --> 45:24.297
[UNCLEAR]

45:24.737 --> 45:29.037
audiences [UNCLEAR]

45:29.257 --> 45:33.457
and I want to ask You, You are saying the same message?

45:33.637 --> 45:40.117
No, no, no, no, not at all, not at all. We had five people affected by her yesterday and we had a very bad time - nothing of the kind.

45:40.857 --> 45:45.537
Firstly, there should be no chanting in sahaja yoga, nothing of the kind, nothing to be done like that

45:47.197 --> 45:53.457
because you're not yet connected - why are you chanting? If your telephone is not connected, how can you

45:54.097 --> 46:01.497
chant so first connection is to be established. Is all wrong, is all money making proposition - you cannot make money.

46:01.817 --> 46:08.417
This is one thing you please understand all of you. If you are going to run after people who are making money, you are in for trouble,

46:08.757 --> 46:16.137
no doubt. Yesterday we had five people who were affected by this lady, she has taken from them lot of money.

46:16.337 --> 46:21.957
Last year this time she said it was bargain for others - imagine! It's a shopping going on.

46:22.897 --> 46:27.837
How can you pay for the living thing? I mean, how much do you pay to the Mother Earth?

46:33.517 --> 46:40.997
- Yes, just a minute, yes.
- [UNCLEAR]

46:41.917 --> 46:47.897
- [UNCLEAR]
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] What is it?

46:48.157 --> 46:55.777
How is it possible if you attain communal consciousness, how can you still have a personality of your own?

46:56.217 --> 46:59.257
Oh, you have a larger personality, that's all.

47:00.857 --> 47:08.117
See now, a man who is living in his hut all the time he is even afraid of seeing another person.

47:08.797 --> 47:13.597
Then he comes out of that in the village, then he changes his personality.

47:14.137 --> 47:21.497
Then a person who travels a lot, his personality is changed - your personality expands

47:22.137 --> 47:26.497
when you become a universal being, you expand.

47:32.117 --> 47:39.017
- Now, what is it?
- Can You tell me have You as a person, Mother
- I knew you're going to ask this question only

47:39.277 --> 47:44.337
- [ALL LAUGH] yeah, but I'm not going to tell anything about Myself.

47:44.617 --> 47:47.997
The reason is this. Christ said that,

47:49.817 --> 47:56.457
He was the Son of God, which He was, no doubt. He was the Son of God - you can prove it

47:56.797 --> 48:03.877
but when he said that they crucified Him. People are so stupid, they cannot bear any truth, you see.

48:05.137 --> 48:12.817
What was the need to crucify Him? If He said He was the Son of God, what, what mistake did He commit? But for that He was crucified.

48:13.317 --> 48:20.837
So when you're dealing with stupid people you have to be careful.[PEOPLE LAUGH] That's what I have learnt a lesson. You see, people are very stupid.

48:21.057 --> 48:27.577
They cannot stand the truth and that's why is not proper to tell anything about Yourself, to claim anything -

48:27.837 --> 48:33.537
just to keep quiet. When you get your realization you will know. It's written down through

48:34.197 --> 48:39.237
realization only you can understand the Spirit - there's no other way out.

48:39.817 --> 48:45.877
Because, like you have to have a microscope to see through for the cells, in the same way

48:46.217 --> 48:53.097
you have to have your realization otherwise you cannot understand. Anybody who comes in, wears a

48:53.377 --> 49:01.257
uh.. saffron dress, people start prostrating before that person without understanding whether is it real or not.

49:01.537 --> 49:07.517
So first, My request is, you get your realization. If you get your realization - which is also not a guarantee -

49:07.817 --> 49:12.557
if you get your realization then you can start understanding who am I.

49:12.817 --> 49:18.917
I'm not going to claim anything whatsoever, I've become very clever and I have to do My work - I don't want to get crucified.

49:19.157 --> 49:26.057
[ALL LAUGH AND CLAP]

49:26.337 --> 49:29.537
[ALL LAUGH AND CLAP]

49:30.297 --> 49:37.737
[UNCLEAR]

49:37.957 --> 49:43.557
- What is it?
- What is the importance of faith?
- Annh?
- What is the importance of faith? Do we

49:44.377 --> 49:50.177
- determine our own destiny or does God determine our destiny?
- What is the importance of faith
- Yeah

49:50.437 --> 49:57.357
- we determine our destiny
- or does God determine?
- Yeah. What is God - this is also the in the same question?

49:58.137 --> 50:03.877
No. The faith is that

50:05.197 --> 50:11.057
it could be blind faith, it could be intuitive faith and it could be

50:11.317 --> 50:17.377
- a real faith. Faith can be
- He said fate
- Annh?
- Fate, fate
- What?

50:17.617 --> 50:21.497
He said Fate, fate, 'f-i-t-e'

50:21.737 --> 50:29.157
- Fight faith?
- Destiny
- Destiny,  fate
- To fight? I didn't [UNCLEAR], what did you say?

50:29.417 --> 50:36.257
- He said fate, I'm sorry to know.  He said fate not faith
- Faith?
- Fate, f-a--t-e
- Fate, fate, annh

50:36.477 --> 50:42.577
That's what I was wondering how does it go with faith and destiny, all these questions together. Alright.

50:45.177 --> 50:51.657
Now, our destiny is only one and that is that, we become the Spirit - that's our destiny

50:51.937 --> 50:55.337
for which you don't have to fight, don't have to do anything.

50:56.097 --> 51:00.457
After you become a realized soul you enter into the Kingdom of God

51:00.937 --> 51:05.597
and then you will realize that you are the most fortunate person.

51:11.777 --> 51:17.397
I'm sorry I, I, that's what I was wondering how can faith and destiny, are two things you are talking.

51:18.437 --> 51:23.157
- Yes
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]

51:23.417 --> 51:26.697
- Faith?
- Yeah
- Faith also?
- Yeah

51:26.977 --> 51:31.857
So the faith, you see, some people have just blind faith into [UNCLEAR - THING?]

51:32.937 --> 51:39.417
and some people have a faith, as I told you, of another kind which is intuitive.

51:40.357 --> 51:46.597
Some people are very intuitive and their faith is absolutely alright and some people have

51:46.937 --> 51:52.697
a faith which our realized souls have, a real faith in the real thing because they see clearly.

51:53.437 --> 51:58.217
The blind faith could be uh... coming from some conditionings,

51:58.517 --> 52:03.357
like I'm born in a particular religion, so I must have faith in that religion.

52:03.917 --> 52:09.277
I might have been born in some other religion in last life but because I'm born in one religion

52:09.497 --> 52:14.397
I think, this is my faith, this is my religion. That's one but

52:15.477 --> 52:22.617
every human-being should use logic and see that, "Alright, my faith in this religion is alright

52:23.157 --> 52:29.437
but are the people who are following this religion, are they practising it or not?

52:30.877 --> 52:35.177
Am I able to practise it or not?" That's why I said, introspection is very important.

52:35.817 --> 52:42.277
If you introspect, then you can find out that your faith is not justified

52:43.037 --> 52:47.097
because you're having faith in people. Say if I have faith in a temple,

52:47.457 --> 52:52.397
I go and see in the temple that the priest is not a man of honesty

52:52.877 --> 52:59.577
or he's a money-maker or he has all other problems then I should not go to such a temple where such a priest is sitting - isn't it?

53:00.217 --> 53:06.397
This is what happened to Martin Luther, is happened to Mohammad Sahab, to so many people that they challenged

53:06.737 --> 53:13.337
all these wrong things that were going on. Even Christ, He challenged, you see. So

53:13.757 --> 53:21.257
this is one thing one has to see, through introspection, that whatever faith I'm following, I'm just doing it because my father has told you

53:21.477 --> 53:28.517
or my mother has told me or am I just following it with proper understanding and logic behind it.

53:29.677 --> 53:36.257
But the intuitive is, some people are born intuitively, I think they're born realized perhaps, that they just shun these things.

53:36.497 --> 53:43.597
I would say, one of the examples is Khalil Gibran. Khalil Gibran, if you read him, he's absolutely you can make out he's a realized soul.

53:44.317 --> 53:52.317
Then, C.S. Lewis is another one, then we have William Blake, so many people, Mozart - so many of them were born realized.

53:52.597 --> 54:00.237
Intuitively they knew, even Einstein, Newton - intuitively they knew what was right -

54:00.577 --> 54:07.117
in their lifestyle - Abraham Lincoln, Gorbachev is another one. So these people are

54:07.597 --> 54:14.937
intuitively having a faith though uh..[UNCLEAR] they do not know that they are born realized people.

54:15.317 --> 54:21.077
But intuitively they good and they always do good to others, they always look for good,

54:21.337 --> 54:29.217
they're very righteous in their own character, in their behaviour and you cannot find faults with them. Or we can say saints, you see.

54:29.517 --> 54:34.277
We in India such people are called as saints whether they are householders or not - they're called as saints

54:34.557 --> 54:38.597
and such saints we have had luckily, quite a lot of people.

54:40.797 --> 54:45.757
They have no respect for people who just have some position or power

54:45.957 --> 54:52.797
like we had one in Nizamuddin in, we had one great saint called Hazrat Nizamuddin, in Delhi,

54:53.057 --> 55:00.577
and a horrible king, Muslim king was ruling and he was a very uh.. cruel person.

55:01.097 --> 55:09.017
He asked this Nizamuddin that, "You come and salute to me." He said, "I will not, I will not salute. You are not the one whom I regard

55:09.257 --> 55:17.117
as something higher than me - I will not salute to you." And he was very angry and then he told him that, "If you do not come and salute to me

55:17.457 --> 55:25.277
and by such and such date, I will cut your neck," and you'll be amazed, one day before that the neck of this king was cut

55:26.057 --> 55:31.517
by someone. It's very surprising. This, this is a true story I'm telling you.

55:31.797 --> 55:35.457
Like, you see, many of the saints have suffered because they wouldn't give up.

55:36.337 --> 55:42.217
They wouldn't give up their truth so these are, I would call, intuitive but they are born realized people

55:42.457 --> 55:47.737
of past lives, great people. These days there are many children who are born like that

55:48.077 --> 55:53.777
and they are of that quality and you can see them in a group like this, you see, these people are sitting

55:53.957 --> 56:01.437
the way they ask questions, the way know, you can see their alertness about it. They never ask stupid questions, never, they're

56:01.717 --> 56:09.097
so much there that you understand how uh.. they are just in tune with the reality.

56:09.657 --> 56:16.917
So there are people like that. Then there are people who get realization. Once they get realization, then they start feeling these vibrations and all that

56:17.157 --> 56:24.077
and on that they judge the truth. You get ten children, tie their eyes up and ask them to

56:24.297 --> 56:31.157
ask the questions like ask them uh.., "What's wrong with this gentleman who's sitting before you?"

56:31.377 --> 56:38.677
Now they can't see the man but they immediately tell you, they'll raise one eye, finger. This finger means something wrong with the throat.

56:38.877 --> 56:46.337
You ask the gentleman, "Is something wrong with your throat?" He said, "Yes, but how do you know?" I said, "The children are telling Me.

56:46.597 --> 56:54.337
"When?" "They showed Me the finger." So it is a knowledge, just like I would say, you become a Divine

56:54.917 --> 56:59.857
uh.. computer, you become a Divine per.... So these possibilities are within you

57:00.457 --> 57:07.377
but there are other categories, the fourth category which Blake has described very well, "The men of God, will seek God

57:07.737 --> 57:15.197
and they will be able, they will get to their point and they will be able to make others Godly," he has said it

57:15.377 --> 57:20.417
but that category are real seekers and these seekers today are getting their realization

57:20.637 --> 57:25.677
very fast with, with very great uh.., I would say,

57:29.097 --> 57:37.077
understanding, very great understanding and they're, they're, they are enjoying themselves. You must see them and you'll be happy to meet them

57:37.237 --> 57:42.057
and they have become so knowledgeable - it's a very subtle knowledge, this Brahma Vidya is a subtle knowledge

57:42.297 --> 57:49.537
but they have become experts in it, just experts. They are giving realizations, they are curing people and they're such lovable, good people.

57:50.917 --> 57:58.317
- Yes.
- Uh.. why are we uh..in ignorance, why are we not realized [UNCLEAR]

57:58.517 --> 58:05.237
You see, you have to pass through this journey - first you have to become human-beings and then you are given

58:05.737 --> 58:10.977
the chance to choose between Hell and Heaven.

58:12.657 --> 58:18.537
You have been given this chance to be in the Heaven or in the Hell

58:18.937 --> 58:26.157
and those who want to be in the Heaven can go to Heaven or can go to Hell

58:26.397 --> 58:31.837
because this freedom had to be given. For example, when you were school you were told 2+2 but in the college you're given

58:32.077 --> 58:39.077
chance to research out yourself, in the same way, you have to research out yourself - full freedom is given to you, research it out

58:39.357 --> 58:44.977
and once you have researched it out, it becomes uh.. easier

58:45.857 --> 58:52.737
for you to get your realization and to bear your freedom later on, which is a complete freedom from everything.

58:53.777 --> 58:56.797
Alright?

58:58.537 --> 59:06.417
Now please put down your  hand. I'm not going to answer any more, there's no sense in your questions. Please put down your hand and don't raise it any more, please. Now

59:06.677 --> 59:11.697
He's, he's using a tape-recorder or something here, I don't know. Now please ask.

59:11.957 --> 59:19.917
[UNCLEAR]

59:20.197 --> 59:26.497
[UNCLEAR]

59:26.737 --> 59:33.737
- What is it?
- Actually [UNCLEAR]
- If we become our own masters - I think I've got your question.

59:34.317 --> 59:38.837
If we become our own masters and are capable of controlling ourselves

59:39.357 --> 59:44.477
how do other people - You, You mentioned that we can feel others - how do other people affect us?

59:44.737 --> 59:49.117
You see, that's what you have to know and that all knowledge is free to you - alright?

59:49.377 --> 59:56.937
How to heal them is you have to just come to see and how we can give protection to them, how to heal them, is a little more knowledge you have to know

59:57.177 --> 01:00:00.317
for which if you come to our centers you can always know it.

01:00:01.377 --> 01:00:07.657
- [UNCLEAR]
- What is it?

01:00:08.057 --> 01:00:12.037
- Yes, our centers not those centers.

01:00:15.397 --> 01:00:20.877
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] You remind Me of a very nice sahaja yogi we have

01:00:21.237 --> 01:00:28.357
uh... in Greece, you see, so I was just wondering how is he here but [UNCLEAR - HE'S?] not the same. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:00:28.797 --> 01:00:34.597
But he also, poor thing you see, is so separated because now they have sent him to

01:00:35.377 --> 01:00:41.077
Cyprus and he's writing to Me, "Mother, please come here so I have more sahaja yogis - I'm all alone."

01:00:41.357 --> 01:00:47.597
So just wondering, he has come or what here. Yes. Huh Yes

01:00:48.217 --> 01:00:55.197
Is there such a thing as a national karma and national karma?

01:00:55.537 --> 01:00:58.577
[NATIONAL KARMA?] [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:00:58.977 --> 01:01:06.157
[UNCLEAR]

01:01:06.337 --> 01:01:09.257
- I agree with you.
- [UNCLEAR]

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:16.977
Yes, but you're saying, I said the same thing that all problems come from human-beings whether it is collective or individual - isn't it?

01:01:17.177 --> 01:01:24.857
Is true, but  this thing what happens is this the, you see the yellow thing that is up there is the ego, that balloon

01:01:25.077 --> 01:01:32.417
that you see on the right side is the ego and this ego is the one which uh... which carries all our karmas

01:01:32.617 --> 01:01:40.637
and the another side are the conditionings, that is the superego so when the Kundalini passes through, as you have seen, She pushes them down.

01:01:42.397 --> 01:01:48.257
When this center opens out, the one that is at the cross point, when that one opens out

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:54.397
then both these institutions are sucked in and that's how it works.

01:01:55.517 --> 01:02:01.477
I think he was also asking Shri Mataji , "Is there such a thing as a national karma?" Is there a karma of Australia?

01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:08.917
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Of course there must be, you see we have collective karmas also,

01:02:09.217 --> 01:02:12.177
no doubt.

01:02:18.437 --> 01:02:24.297
You see, there are so many things we have done in the past which are inhuman

01:02:24.677 --> 01:02:29.497
even on national level, I agree with you - every country has done

01:02:30.357 --> 01:02:36.297
and unless and until they realize that it was wrong and they really openly say that

01:02:38.017 --> 01:02:43.177
it is not easy to neutralize it but they can ask for forgiveness because

01:02:43.417 --> 01:02:48.797
this Divine Power is the ocean of forgiveness and it can be easily forgiven

01:02:48.957 --> 01:02:53.857
but they have to accept it but in their ego they'll never say that they have done this mistake or that mistake.

01:02:54.177 --> 01:03:00.357
Like the uh.. Germans, you see, they came and they said, "What mistakes our forefathers have committed."

01:03:00.897 --> 01:03:04.157
So one has to be very gentle about it.

01:03:06.997 --> 01:03:14.477
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

01:03:14.937 --> 01:03:22.497
- during unbearable pain.
- [UNCLEAR]

01:03:23.077 --> 01:03:26.977
Is it possible, is it possible to receive

01:03:27.217 --> 01:03:33.377
Divinity without asking for it under the circumstances of unbearable pain.

01:03:33.717 --> 01:03:38.357
Yeah of course. You see, the Divinity is there all the time

01:03:38.637 --> 01:03:42.957
and only you can bear that pain when you have felt your Divinity.

01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:48.837
Like Christ you see, when He was crucified at that time He

01:03:49.057 --> 01:03:54.037
has asked for forgiveness for those who have crucified Him - that's an example.

01:03:56.797 --> 01:04:03.277
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:13.097
If you are happy and content in a general way, how does that differ from being enlightened?

01:04:13.357 --> 01:04:20.577
- How does that differ from?
- Being enlightened.
- Because you are not a universal being as yet.

01:04:21.037 --> 01:04:27.617
you are just satisfied with something uh... superficial, not with something deep

01:04:27.937 --> 01:04:34.677
and once something will come before you of that kind you'll be shocked, you won't be able to bear it.

01:04:35.657 --> 01:04:41.417
It's like that. Supposing, you have a house made of uh.. things,

01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:49.197
thin paper and you're quite satisfied sitting under the thin paper thing thinking, "Oh, I'm alright. It's looking after me,"

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:52.397
but when it will rain then what will you do?

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:59.337
So you have to develop yourself into a personality that nothing can disturb you.

01:05:01.217 --> 01:05:08.937
Moreover, what is the use of self-contented life which is self-opinionated and self-centered - will never be happy.

01:05:09.857 --> 01:05:17.597
See, even uh... Roosevelt said that, "Poverty anywhere is threat to

01:05:18.857 --> 01:05:26.417
uh.. prosperity everywhere." So anywhere you feel anybody, like Buddha was such a uh..

01:05:26.777 --> 01:05:33.797
great king's son, everything and he saw a person suffering uh..as a sick man

01:05:34.117 --> 01:05:40.677
and somebody dying and all his comfort and all his uh..

01:05:41.077 --> 01:05:48.577
complacenses just disappeared and then he started thinking, "What's this, where am I?" -

01:05:48.797 --> 01:05:52.077
you see. So that satisfaction

01:05:52.397 --> 01:05:57.557
is not going to be uh.. of eternal nature but of a very temporary nature.

01:05:59.637 --> 01:06:07.477
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's it, what did she say?
- Can anger ever be Divine?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:13.617
- Divide?
- Divine. Can anger ever be Divine?
- Divine?

01:06:14.157 --> 01:06:17.057
Yes, there is Divine anger very much.

01:06:18.117 --> 01:06:25.077
See, you must have heard about the God who is very wrathful, is no doubt and I'm quite frightened of that

01:06:25.397 --> 01:06:30.657
because I don't want anybody to be hurt but sometimes people do such horrible things that

01:06:30.957 --> 01:06:34.697
I get worried that I don't know what's going to happen to this person.

01:06:41.737 --> 01:06:47.857
Is realization the same as enlightenment [UNCLEAR]

01:06:48.277 --> 01:06:55.317
[UNCLEAR]

01:06:56.897 --> 01:07:04.677
- Hunh?
- Is enlightenment the same thing as Self-realization or getting the Holy Spirit and does this come from

01:07:05.377 --> 01:07:12.557
- letting oneself go in meditation?
- Self?
- Self-realization, is it the same as enlightenment?

01:07:12.757 --> 01:07:20.337
Of course is the same. Enlightenment is the beginning of your Nirvana, I'll say, is what Buddha - Buddha means to know.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:28.237
Know, is to know on your Central Nervous System - Buddha is to know, the 'gna', 'gna' - Gnostics is the same.

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:34.857
Then we have also another word 'Veda' from the word 'Vid'. 'Vid' means also to know on your Central Nervous System

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:41.277
not uh... mental - so is the same, is the same thing as enlightenment.

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:51.917
- Does it come through meditation?
- Does it come through meditation?
- No.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:59.557
Meditation is actually before realization is introspection.

01:08:00.357 --> 01:08:05.997
Meditation is simple introspection because your mind is all the time working, is not stops,

01:08:06.297 --> 01:08:10.497
so that time when you meditate before realization, you should introspect

01:08:11.537 --> 01:08:15.737
and after realization you are in meditation.

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:21.617
You don't do it, you are in meditation - that you enter into the area of present

01:08:23.477 --> 01:08:31.577
so you are in meditation. So to do meditation is out of question - is better is meditation is introspection

01:08:31.817 --> 01:08:35.237
and later on to be in meditation so that you grow.

01:08:46.137 --> 01:08:54.017
Mother [UNCLEAR]

01:08:54.237 --> 01:09:00.837
[UNCLEAR]

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:05.077
[UNCLEAR]

01:09:05.597 --> 01:09:13.577
If actors allow the [UNCLEAR] if actors allow their part to take them over, is this a dangerous thing?

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:18.897
- When they become completely the part otherwise they become possessed.
- Yeah, could be,

01:09:19.117 --> 01:09:26.477
could be with some people, could be but is better that after realization you should take it because it won't happen to you that way

01:09:26.817 --> 01:09:31.917
because you are your own, you become your own so it won't happen but could be

01:09:32.117 --> 01:09:35.657
possible - they can just get lost into it, it's quite possible.

01:09:42.057 --> 01:09:48.217
- I [UNCLEAR] give them realization now?
- I think you should because [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

01:09:49.297 --> 01:09:52.277
- Should I ask?
- Ask them.

01:09:57.877 --> 01:10:05.517
Now those who want to have realization should be here. Those who do not want I cannot force on them.

01:10:06.737 --> 01:10:12.837
Please I have to say that lot of people thinking that their classes they are to move

01:10:13.097 --> 01:10:19.057
that so many people like to stay here [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] this auditorium can stay.

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:26.417
- Now you are in different [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
- If anybody who should stay, cannot go

01:10:26.817 --> 01:10:31.257
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:10:31.557 --> 01:10:35.237
You're all in a different area now  [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:39.457
Within these two three days can you imagine where have you reached?

01:10:39.837 --> 01:10:45.857
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] This is another one  [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:10:46.217 --> 01:10:49.157
Just you laugh all the time, isn't it?

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:54.757
It's very interesting how you change so fast.

01:10:54.997 --> 01:11:00.297
- Would you like to come closely?
- It better, hmm
- We come closer

01:11:01.117 --> 01:11:04.077
It's all right we can...

01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:09.057
[UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR]

01:11:11.937 --> 01:11:18.777
I went to Your lecture few months ago, there was a talk about [UNCLEAR]

01:11:19.017 --> 01:11:24.837
- About Matreya?
- [UNCLEAR]

01:11:25.157 --> 01:11:34.077
- formation of sine energy [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah
- Do You know Matreya?

01:11:34.397 --> 01:11:38.637
Yes, Matreya is the three Mothers together, is Matreya.

01:11:39.397 --> 01:11:45.797
When you'll come to the center they'll tell you what it actually means - Matreya, is the three Mothers together.

01:11:53.117 --> 01:11:56.877
[UNCLEAR]

01:11:57.097 --> 01:12:04.197
Oh, they're all - they're somebody calling themselves Jesus, somebody calling themself Shri Krishna, Bhagwan - everything is there,

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:11.657
I mean it's nothing new. You see, anybody says that you should ask them uh...

01:12:12.757 --> 01:12:16.477
Like somebody said, "I'm Christ." I said, " Al... walk on the water."

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:21.877
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]  then he fizzled out

01:12:22.197 --> 01:12:26.557
[ALL LAUGH]

01:12:27.217 --> 01:12:33.417
You see, it's very easy to call yourself by some name but what they do is the point.

01:12:43.697 --> 01:12:51.277
Seems sometimes that looking at [UNCLEAR] do You think that

01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:56.897
enough people will become actualized in enough time to save them

01:12:57.117 --> 01:13:03.877
- Now I have lots of
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, yeah now I've lots of hopes. Absolutely I'm sure of it now.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:12.157
It's going to work out. Most surprising is that the people who are at the helm of affairs

01:13:12.457 --> 01:13:18.097
are trying to come to sahaja yoga - that's how it will work.

01:13:30.857 --> 01:13:38.877
So now, to get your realization uh.. one thing I've to request you to take out your shoes - takes about ten minutes only.

01:14:05.957 --> 01:14:13.557
It is a collective happening so, even if you get realization, you must know that you must come to the collective

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:20.477
and the collective gives you strength and you get very much corrected and

01:14:20.897 --> 01:14:26.777
it's like this - a nail which is cut out is not looked after by the body

01:14:27.537 --> 01:14:31.397
in the same way if you do not come to the collective

01:14:32.877 --> 01:14:39.177
you won't be able to achieve any heights

01:14:39.797 --> 01:14:44.757
so you have to be in the collective and enjoy the collective - that's very important.

01:14:45.117 --> 01:14:52.137
It's no more an individual practice, it is a collective practice and spreading of sahaja yoga

01:14:52.337 --> 01:14:58.017
so that you develop your depth. As a tree when it spreads it goes down also.

01:14:58.357 --> 01:15:04.217
So it's a very beautiful collective happening and sharing with each other.

01:15:06.037 --> 01:15:09.337
Now request you to

01:15:11.677 --> 01:15:17.297
know about two conditions we have to fulfill.

01:15:22.177 --> 01:15:28.757
The first condition is that

01:15:31.577 --> 01:15:37.937
you have to know that

01:15:38.497 --> 01:15:46.357
whatever you have done in the past, maybe your mistakes or whatever it is, are

01:15:47.337 --> 01:15:53.957
dissolved by this power of forgiveness which is All-Pervading

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:58.597
so you should not feel guilty at all for anything.

01:15:59.217 --> 01:16:06.217
At this moment you should not feel guilty at all, as I said, forget the past at this moment - not to feel guilty

01:16:06.917 --> 01:16:13.257
because if you feel guilty, then you develop the problem on this center on the left-hand side

01:16:13.877 --> 01:16:20.657
and also you develop with that a possibility of getting spondylitis

01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:24.437
or getting, what you call,

01:16:27.317 --> 01:16:33.857
angina or also problems of the lethargic uh.. organs within you.

01:16:34.297 --> 01:16:41.657
So it's a very dangerous thing to feel guilty, so and the Kundalini won't rise if you have a problem

01:16:42.057 --> 01:16:47.117
of your guilt, so at this moment please forget completely

01:16:47.257 --> 01:16:54.257
that you're guilty, that you have done any mistakes, you have done anything wrong - just forget about it at this moment.

01:16:57.817 --> 01:17:04.277
You'll feel much lighter. Anybody who might have told you that you're this, you're that - forget it.

01:17:04.677 --> 01:17:10.397
Nobody has right to judge anyone. Now you have to put your left hand towards Me.

01:17:17.937 --> 01:17:21.277
Now, the another condition is that

01:17:23.057 --> 01:17:28.257
another condition is that, you have to forgive

01:17:29.737 --> 01:17:34.337
everyone without thinking about an individual.

01:17:35.477 --> 01:17:43.297
You might say it is very difficult to forgive but what do you do? Logically, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:50.717
but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands so you forgive yourself as well as you forgive

01:17:51.257 --> 01:17:57.397
everyone in the sense don't even think of them because

01:17:58.177 --> 01:18:03.937
they are torturing you through you. They are not tortured, you are torturing yourself

01:18:04.677 --> 01:18:12.037
and it's a myth because you're not doing anything. Just you say, once for all, "I forgive

01:18:13.257 --> 01:18:19.157
everyone in general," just say from your heart.

01:18:19.977 --> 01:18:28.037
Now there's a center which, I said, is the optic chiasma here which is like this absolutely closed but when you forgive, it opens out

01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:35.257
and then only Kundalini rises. In these few programs everywhere

01:18:35.537 --> 01:18:42.277
in Australia I found they do not forgive and I have to sit for hours together clearing their center.

01:18:42.697 --> 01:18:48.917
So best is that if you can really forgive from your heart. Just say that, "I forgive everyone," just throw it away.

01:18:49.377 --> 01:18:56.837
You'll feel the load off your head, I tell you, just the load off your head, if you can really forgive.

01:18:57.437 --> 01:19:03.717
Now, these are the two conditions - left hand towards Me, right hand on your heart.

01:19:04.637 --> 01:19:07.557
In the heart resides the Spirit.

01:19:08.657 --> 01:19:12.797
Both the feet have to be away from each other because these are two powers.

01:19:14.737 --> 01:19:21.637
Here resides the Spirit but the seat of the Spirit is here on the fontanel bone area.

01:19:22.337 --> 01:19:29.817
Now, put down your hand [ASIDE - COME HERE THIS SIDE, IS BETTER, HELLO. COME THIS SIDE EVERYBODY CAN'T SEE. HAAN]

01:19:31.177 --> 01:19:38.437
Right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side - we'll be working only on left-hand side.

01:19:38.757 --> 01:19:46.057
Upper portion of your abdomen. Please put your hand upper portion of your abdomen, here.

01:19:47.257 --> 01:19:50.477
Please put the left hand like this, here. Now

01:19:52.057 --> 01:19:56.997
then you have to put your left hand into the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:19:59.177 --> 01:20:04.177
The upper portion of your abdomen is a very important center of your mastery

01:20:04.597 --> 01:20:11.357
and the lower portion of your abdomen is another very important center of pure knowledge.

01:20:11.797 --> 01:20:15.257
I'm just now showing you then we'll close our eyes and work it out.

01:20:15.517 --> 01:20:20.797
Now raise your right hand again onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:20:21.757 --> 01:20:25.797
Now, raise it higher on to your heart

01:20:32.497 --> 01:20:38.577
Now, then raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:20:39.097 --> 01:20:45.697
which is, I told you, is a center when it is spoilt, you get due to guilt

01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:50.957
you get all kinds of diseases. Now turn your head left to right fully.

01:20:54.977 --> 01:21:00.377
Now, put your right hand on your forehead across,

01:21:02.117 --> 01:21:05.137
put down your head as far as possible.

01:21:07.177 --> 01:21:12.217
Here you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:21:13.297 --> 01:21:21.197
Take back your right hand now on the back side of your head. Push back your head fully, as far as possible.

01:21:23.437 --> 01:21:26.577
Here, without counting your mistakes,

01:21:28.957 --> 01:21:36.397
without feeling guilty, you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading power.

01:21:41.437 --> 01:21:46.197
Now, you have to stretch your palm fully

01:21:49.477 --> 01:21:56.817
Put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:22:02.257 --> 01:22:10.277
Now, put down your head and press it hard,

01:22:16.517 --> 01:22:20.497
push back your fingers so you can press it very hard.

01:22:22.197 --> 01:22:27.477
Now, move your scalp slowly, seven times, clockwise.

01:22:59.717 --> 01:23:02.677
Hmm

01:23:07.397 --> 01:23:10.497
That's all we have to do.

01:23:13.517 --> 01:23:20.817
Now, again remember to put your feet on the ground straight, both of them apart from each other.

01:23:21.177 --> 01:23:26.757
Put the left hand towards Me, sit straight, not within strain but straight.

01:23:27.557 --> 01:23:33.237
Now, not like this bent or forward bent but sit straight.

01:23:33.817 --> 01:23:37.457
Please now, close your eyes.

01:23:37.777 --> 01:23:43.377
You can take out your spectacles because you're not to open your eyes till I tell you.

01:23:47.897 --> 01:23:51.117
Now, take your right hand on your heart.

01:24:02.997 --> 01:24:06.537
Now, here you have to ask

01:24:06.777 --> 01:24:12.577
a very fundamental question to Me - you may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:24:15.757 --> 01:24:21.137
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - ask this question three times.

01:24:21.537 --> 01:24:27.037
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - ask this question three times.

01:24:36.517 --> 01:24:41.557
If you are the Spirit, you become your own master.

01:24:45.717 --> 01:24:52.417
So now, take down your hand, right hand upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard

01:24:53.637 --> 01:24:58.377
and here ask another fundamental question, three times, in your heart,

01:24:58.917 --> 01:25:02.177
"Mother, am I my own master."

01:25:02.717 --> 01:25:08.077
Again ask this question, "Mother, am I my own master,"

01:25:13.097 --> 01:25:18.937
three times. I've already told you that I respect your freedom

01:25:21.217 --> 01:25:26.537
and that I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:25:27.177 --> 01:25:35.177
This pure knowledge manifests on your Central Nervous System and gives you all the powers of a realized soul

01:25:37.337 --> 01:25:40.277
so you have to ask for this pure knowledge.

01:25:41.377 --> 01:25:47.937
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

01:25:50.977 --> 01:25:57.357
Here you have to say with

01:26:00.557 --> 01:26:06.897
humility of course, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:16.017
Say it six times because this center has got six petals, six petals

01:26:16.237 --> 01:26:21.957
so please say it six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:26:40.937 --> 01:26:46.497
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising so you have to

01:26:46.917 --> 01:26:53.657
expand your upper centers with your full self-confidence.

01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:59.857
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:09.697
and here you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

01:27:10.537 --> 01:27:14.257
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:27:14.557 --> 01:27:20.697
Please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:27:40.937 --> 01:27:45.957
I have already told you that you're not this body, you're not this mind,

01:27:46.237 --> 01:27:53.197
you're not this ego, you're not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:27:57.797 --> 01:28:05.837
So now raise your right hand on to your heart and again with full confidence in yourself

01:28:08.077 --> 01:28:14.917
please say twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:28:15.297 --> 01:28:22.057
Please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am your pure Spirit."

01:28:40.757 --> 01:28:48.577
This Divine power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of

01:28:49.337 --> 01:28:57.417
compassion, love and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:28:57.817 --> 01:29:04.497
and you cannot commit any mistake which cannot be dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:29:05.777 --> 01:29:12.797
So please now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:29:13.037 --> 01:29:18.597
and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times,

01:29:20.597 --> 01:29:24.597
with full self-confidence sixteen times,

01:29:25.817 --> 01:29:31.097
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times.

01:29:34.197 --> 01:29:42.377
Unless and until you say this from your heart sixteen times, this center won't open.

01:29:53.017 --> 01:30:00.477
Also I've told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you do not

01:30:00.877 --> 01:30:06.937
do anything, it's a myth but if you do not forgive then you play

01:30:07.177 --> 01:30:10.697
into wrong hands and you torture yourself

01:30:11.417 --> 01:30:17.717
while those you have tortured you or troubled you are not at all in any way troubled

01:30:18.397 --> 01:30:21.677
so please, get rid of this myth.

01:30:22.117 --> 01:30:26.137
Now raise your right hand on to your forehead across

01:30:26.397 --> 01:30:30.517
and put down your head, as far as possible, resting on the hand.

01:30:36.677 --> 01:30:41.057
This is a very important thing to do, so please

01:30:42.037 --> 01:30:46.777
say, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:55.597
Just say from your heart, not how many times but from your heart,

01:30:55.917 --> 01:31:00.417
say it, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:31:22.297 --> 01:31:30.137
Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible.

01:31:31.177 --> 01:31:38.117
Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to say

01:31:39.037 --> 01:31:45.857
"O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly,

01:31:46.117 --> 01:31:53.417
please forgive me." "O divine power, if I have done anything wrong

01:31:53.877 --> 01:32:00.557
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." Push back your head as far as possible.

01:32:15.837 --> 01:32:22.677
Now, stretch your palm fully, push back your fingers,

01:32:24.117 --> 01:32:28.037
put your center of your palm on top of your head

01:32:29.537 --> 01:32:37.417
where it is a soft bone called as fontanel bone area - put the center there, push back your fingers.

01:32:37.977 --> 01:32:43.757
Now put down your head, put a good pressure. Here again I cannot

01:32:44.517 --> 01:32:51.937
cross over your freedom, which I respect very much, so you have to ask for your Self-realization,

01:32:52.197 --> 01:32:58.637
I cannot force it on you. So please put down your head, give a good pressure on the scalp,

01:32:58.977 --> 01:33:02.037
move your scalp seven times clockwise

01:33:03.597 --> 01:33:08.557
saying seven times, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:33:11.437 --> 01:33:17.437
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:33:20.037 --> 01:33:30.597
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:33:37.037 --> 01:33:47.637
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:33:51.557 --> 01:34:02.757
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:34:07.157 --> 01:34:18.197
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:34:21.317 --> 01:34:29.677
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:34:32.597 --> 01:34:41.217
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:48.677
Now please take down your hands, open your eyes,

01:34:49.257 --> 01:34:55.117
put both your hands towards Me, watch Me without thinking.

01:34:58.657 --> 01:35:06.177
Now put your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself

01:35:06.397 --> 01:35:13.477
if there's a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area - please put it your [UNCLEAR]

01:35:25.277 --> 01:35:33.117
Now, don't put your hand on your head, away from it little fa - some people get it further away

01:35:33.337 --> 01:35:39.617
but you should not put it on top uh.. touching the head, little away.

01:35:40.557 --> 01:35:43.557
Now, please take your left hand like this

01:35:45.917 --> 01:35:52.137
and again put down your head and see with your right hand - bend your head and please see with your right hand,

01:35:52.377 --> 01:36:00.437
there's a cool or a hot breeze coming. If you have not forgiven, it will be hot breeze so even now you can forgive everyone in general.

01:36:08.917 --> 01:36:16.457
You can move your hand little higher or on the sides to see. Now don't doubt.

01:36:18.457 --> 01:36:23.017
Now please put your right hand towards Me and again put down your left hand

01:36:23.277 --> 01:36:28.637
and see for yourself, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:36:46.697 --> 01:36:53.797
Hmm, now we have to put both our hands towards the sky, like this

01:36:54.977 --> 01:37:01.037
and ask a question, any one of these questions, three times - push back your head,

01:37:01.697 --> 01:37:07.597
ask a questions, three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:37:09.337 --> 01:37:16.077
or, "Mother, is this the power of Divine love?"

01:37:16.717 --> 01:37:20.077
or, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?"

01:37:20.537 --> 01:37:25.577
Just ask this question, any one of them, three times - push back your head.

01:37:32.117 --> 01:37:35.257
