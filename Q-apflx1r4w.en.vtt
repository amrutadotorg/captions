00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:14.291
One, there is this program that we have bought a land

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:19.900
There, how to do agriculture through Sahaja Yoga, for that there is a research center

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.502
For that we have a Director,  who is Dr Hamid, who will himself be coming and staying here

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:29.249
Now in the fields if you put Vibrated water....... He has done this experiment

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.585
He did not have any thing with him to Vibrate

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.067
And they do not have water from the well , whereas we have water from wells here

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.941
He put the ring which had my photo into the tap

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.379
So he showed....

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.625
now there were two type of Hybrid and two type of seeds

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:49.325
so when he grew the Hybrid, it grew so big

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:51.284
Without Hybrid it became like this

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:54.755
And without Hybrid, on that he put Water from Sahaja yoga

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:58.365
and they became so big. So he conducted many experiments like this

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:00.278
Now acid rains happening there

00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:03.444
On Acid rains he has conducted experiments using vibrated water

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:07.900
You will be surprised that on trees which are more than 60 years of age there is no effect

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.123
but the rest of the trees are all flourishing

00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:11.814
They have this very big problem

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:16.384
So there is this very big work and for that he has made many a Charts and all of them are coming

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:17.435
in which country?

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:19.405
In Agriculture , over here only, in India

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:20.956
All the work will happen in India only,

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:23.719
you see this is one very big work that agriculture over here becomes OK

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.073
Now if you go and see the agriculture of our Sahaja yogis and you will say where has this come from?

00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:31.582
these grains which are like pearls!

00:01:31.582 --> 00:01:36.289
And these grains which are kept in storerooms also, rats dont eat it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.207
rats dont touch it.... leave them in the open

00:01:38.207 --> 00:01:40.318
Everything else they will eat, but they will not eat those

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:43.166
And each of the fruits if you will see, like Papaya...

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:48.184
if you see the papaya of Sahaja yoga, then you will not believe that they are Papays's of India

00:01:48.184 --> 00:01:50.596
So sweet and they last for very long

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:54.454
So this thing we have to do to improve the prosperity of our country

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:56.348
this is one of the big work being done

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:06.405
All problem !

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:13.490
now if you have any poor people….I would like to tell another thing ……about poor people

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.049
Now see, our country is an agriculture based country

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.357
what we call as farm based people, they are more in our country

00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:24.229
With the help of Sahaja Yoga what happens is that,

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:30.983
sometimes the agriculture produce can increase sometimes 10 times or even 20 times

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:35.342
each each Sunflower grows so big , with the help of these vibrations

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:37.245
And a lot more can happen

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:41.299
So due to this, a sahaja Yogi who is there , becomes rich

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.197
Because he has the best seeds, the best agriculture produce

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:49.460
and he is better off than most other people

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.950
So the countries which is agriculture based, for them Sahaja Yoga is an amazing thing

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.898
Even Milk... our Indian cows also gives about 4 to 5 (ser) milk at the maximum

00:02:58.898 --> 00:03:01.491
now she starts giving around 12(ser)

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:04.320
And we don’t need to buy hybrid seeds

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.517
Just vibrating the normal seeds solves the problem!

00:03:07.517 --> 00:03:11.799
So you don’t need to be a slave of any company

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.676
So in this way, the problems of our country, specially our country, can be solved.

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:18.041
There are many such things

00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:21.898
In Sahaja Yoga one can understand. which are the special things we have in our country

00:03:21.898 --> 00:03:23.415
What all can be sent abroad

00:03:23.415 --> 00:03:26.443
You get a subtle understanding about this.

00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:30.000
And with this you see how so many people are sending things abroad.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.062
What all is being done

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:33.181
And you all will also prosper

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:37.106
because you get this subtle understanding

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:44.582
In every way due to an individual personality become a part of the Whole

00:03:44.582 --> 00:03:50.538
all the hidden qualities which are within him starts getting enlightened

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:52.886
Big big musicians are in Sahaja Yoga

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:56.415
Big big artists are in Sahaja Yoga

00:03:56.415 --> 00:03:59.841
Our commander-in-chief is also in Sahaja yoga

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:05.580
In this way, this thing is like this that when a person achieve this state

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.212
he achieves a state called " Parama Pad" (the supreme status)

00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:10.475
Every-time we say " parama pad dijiyo means please bless us with the supreme status

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.408
This is the "Parama Pad" the Supreme Status

00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:19.134
Because this body is filled with energy you don’t need.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:22.327
Actually, this is the first time the energy is filling you all.

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:24.745
Then you give vibrations.

00:04:24.745 --> 00:04:28.087
In Rahuri [Maharashtra state] there called university there they have experimented

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:33.909
In the University for first time they have
experimented in agriculture university with these vibrations

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:41.077
They have found that the growth of all this wheat was 10 ten times more

00:04:41.077 --> 00:04:44.620
They have found that the fruits that came out of it were beautiful

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.873
and they were so tasty and so lasting

00:04:47.873 --> 00:04:50.796
They found that when the cow was given vibrated water

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:55.907
Indian cow started giving milk like an Australian cow

00:04:55.907 --> 00:04:59.783
But I cannot write a guarantee check for you

00:04:59.783 --> 00:05:01.283
That is one thing.

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:03.289
So all the miseries so called, will drop out

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.846
The second power of the second center has the power of creativity

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:21.087
You get the creativity, which is living

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:24.503
So far you never had

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:26.207
we take everything from the nature

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:30.541
We have never given anything to the nature

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:37.417
When this center is enlightened then when you give.. say vibrations to a field of wheat

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:42.958
In India they have done experiments in many universities of Agriculture

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:48.193
and we have many scientists are doing it, they are Sahaja Yogis

00:05:48.193 --> 00:06:00.952
and they have found out that the same seed if it is vibrated can produce five times more wheat

00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:09.217
not only that but they stored that wheat in a big store where there were other things stored up

00:06:09.217 --> 00:06:17.578
And the rats did not touch those bags, Gani bags which contained those wheats.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:20.000
It’s worth seeing all these

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.509
There were cows, Indian cows do not give milk as much as the milk as much as other cows

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.034
like, you can say New Zealand or Australian cows

00:06:33.034 --> 00:06:37.211
but these two type of foreign cows are extremely aggressive

00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:42.618
and their milk make people very, very aggressive

00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:44.727
and the taste is not so good

00:06:44.727 --> 00:06:47.651
But Indian cows give very nice milk

00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:50.947
It doesn’t make people very aggressive and the taste is very good

00:06:50.947 --> 00:06:53.593
But the Indian cows when they were given vibrations,

00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:57.590
supposing they were giving five seers of milk

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.952
they have started giving at least ten  seers or twelve  seers,

00:07:02.952 --> 00:07:06.477
not so much as these aggressive ones have give

00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:12.527
but their longevity increased

00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:23.666
This is how you start giving these enlightened dimensions to things.

00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:40.508
Material development is much faster and in balance when you get Self Realization

00:07:40.508 --> 00:07:45.103
These vibrations help agriculture very much

00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:51.543
We have a scientist, Dr. Hamid, in Austria

00:07:51.543 --> 00:07:54.404
who has experimented with vibrations

00:07:54.404 --> 00:08:02.647
and has found out that even non-hybrid seeds give you greater yield than the hybrid seeds

00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:12.724
In my own field I sowed about 60 kilos of rice in one acre of land

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:15.949
And they told me “It’s a special rice. It won’t grow here”

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:21.455
But it turned out to be 1700 kilos

00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:24.076
One of the best rices

00:08:24.076 --> 00:08:28.930
And even the sunflower was so big, two feet diameter

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.234
You could not lift; one person could not lift

00:08:31.234 --> 00:08:35.669
Giving oil six to ten times more!

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:41.580
Do you know, from your country, you are exporting sweet peas

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.592
and also sort of pulses to India

00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:49.017
Chickpeas also. Millions tones of....

00:08:49.017 --> 00:08:51.784
If you vibrate them…

00:08:51.784 --> 00:08:52.753
Better do it fast

00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:58.518
If Indians start doing it, they may not import

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.806
Now our country is of farmers so, I told everyone that do Sahaj yoga,

00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:25.548
use vibrated water for farming,

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:31.514
come to Sahaj yoga by which your yield can increase up to ten times.

00:09:31.713 --> 00:09:33.805
But people do not listen.

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:38.153
Many Agriculture University people also did big research

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:42.148
and the news spread everywhere that such a thing can happen.

00:09:42.321 --> 00:09:53.286
Even from Austria a very famous Mr. Hamid, Dr. Hamid has come for this.

00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:55.505
He was an advisor in UNO.

00:09:55.608 --> 00:10:00.858
He also did experiments and explained to everyone

00:10:00.985 --> 00:10:06.041
but don’t know what’s the matter that this doesn’t go into the heads of people.

00:10:06.104 --> 00:10:08.726
As if their brains are not alright.

00:10:08.822 --> 00:10:11.894
Try to do farming this way and see for yourself.

00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:15.329
If you see ten farms and one farm is full of greenery

00:10:15.413 --> 00:10:18.998
then understand for sure that this is a farm of some Sahaj yogi.

00:10:19.296 --> 00:10:22.752
In everything, also we have seen, in animal husbandry.

00:10:22.867 --> 00:10:27.795
We did experiments and were told that one cow gives up to ten litres of milk.

00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:30.571
Surprisingly, it’s about our Indian cow

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:36.284
and even the seeds which they use are not the seeds brought from the shops or anywhere

00:10:36.378 --> 00:10:38.058
but commonly used seeds,

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:40.539
so much was produced from that seed,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.030
but nobody is ready to listen.

00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:49.462
In this India, if you call a newspaperman,

00:10:49.543 --> 00:10:53.767
they only notice that there was a carpet spread out at your place,

00:10:53.848 --> 00:10:56.856
there was a lamp was illuminated at your place.

00:10:56.937 --> 00:11:01.161
There is nothing beyond that. They don’t see anything beyond that.

00:11:01.242 --> 00:11:02.922
They don’t hear anything,

00:11:03.003 --> 00:11:08.379
they don’t write anything instead they write some silly things which has no meaning.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.404
We have brought such a great thing before you,

00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:13.425
at least listen to something.

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:15.960
But they are not ready to listen to anything.

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:18.587
Don’t know what kind of brain people have here!
