WEBVTT

00:09.095 --> 00:14.291
One, there is this program that we have bought a land

00:14.291 --> 00:19.900
There, how to do agriculture through Sahaja Yoga, for that there is a research center

00:19.900 --> 00:25.502
For that we have a Director,  who is Dr Hamid, who will himself be coming and staying here

00:25.502 --> 00:29.249
Now in the fields if you put Vibrated water....... He has done this experiment

00:29.249 --> 00:31.585
He did not have any thing with him to Vibrate

00:31.585 --> 00:34.067
And they do not have water from the well , whereas we have water from wells here

00:34.067 --> 00:37.941
He put the ring which had my photo into the tap

00:37.941 --> 00:39.379
So he showed....

00:41.010 --> 00:44.625
now there were two type of Hybrid and two type of seeds

00:44.625 --> 00:49.325
so when he grew the Hybrid, it grew so big

00:49.325 --> 00:51.284
Without Hybrid it became like this

00:51.284 --> 00:54.755
And without Hybrid, on that he put Water from Sahaja yoga

00:54.755 --> 00:58.365
and they became so big. So he conducted many experiments like this

00:58.365 --> 01:00.278
Now acid rains happening there

01:00.278 --> 01:03.444
On Acid rains he has conducted experiments using vibrated water

01:03.444 --> 01:07.900
You will be surprised that on trees which are more than 60 years of age there is no effect

01:07.900 --> 01:10.123
but the rest of the trees are all flourishing

01:10.123 --> 01:11.814
They have this very big problem

01:11.814 --> 01:16.384
So there is this very big work and for that he has made many a Charts and all of them are coming

01:16.384 --> 01:17.435
in which country?

01:17.435 --> 01:19.405
In Agriculture , over here only, in India

01:19.405 --> 01:20.956
All the work will happen in India only,

01:20.956 --> 01:23.719
you see this is one very big work that agriculture over here becomes OK

01:23.719 --> 01:28.073
Now if you go and see the agriculture of our Sahaja yogis and you will say where has this come from?

01:28.073 --> 01:31.582
these grains which are like pearls!

01:31.582 --> 01:36.289
And these grains which are kept in storerooms also, rats dont eat it

01:36.289 --> 01:38.207
rats dont touch it.... leave them in the open

01:38.207 --> 01:40.318
Everything else they will eat, but they will not eat those

01:40.318 --> 01:43.166
And each of the fruits if you will see, like Papaya...

01:43.166 --> 01:48.184
if you see the papaya of Sahaja yoga, then you will not believe that they are Papays's of India

01:48.184 --> 01:50.596
So sweet and they last for very long

01:50.596 --> 01:54.454
So this thing we have to do to improve the prosperity of our country

01:54.454 --> 01:56.348
this is one of the big work being done

02:04.468 --> 02:06.405
All problem !

02:06.405 --> 02:13.490
now if you have any poor people….I would like to tell another thing ……about poor people

02:13.490 --> 02:17.049
Now see, our country is an agriculture based country

02:17.049 --> 02:21.357
what we call as farm based people, they are more in our country

02:21.357 --> 02:24.229
With the help of Sahaja Yoga what happens is that,

02:24.229 --> 02:30.983
sometimes the agriculture produce can increase sometimes 10 times or even 20 times

02:30.983 --> 02:35.342
each each Sunflower grows so big , with the help of these vibrations

02:35.342 --> 02:37.245
And a lot more can happen

02:37.245 --> 02:41.299
So due to this, a sahaja Yogi who is there , becomes rich

02:41.299 --> 02:47.197
Because he has the best seeds, the best agriculture produce

02:47.197 --> 02:49.460
and he is better off than most other people

02:49.460 --> 02:53.950
So the countries which is agriculture based, for them Sahaja Yoga is an amazing thing

02:53.950 --> 02:58.898
Even Milk... our Indian cows also gives about 4 to 5 (ser) milk at the maximum

02:58.898 --> 03:01.491
now she starts giving around 12(ser)

03:01.491 --> 03:04.320
And we don’t need to buy hybrid seeds

03:04.320 --> 03:07.517
Just vibrating the normal seeds solves the problem!

03:07.517 --> 03:11.799
So you don’t need to be a slave of any company

03:11.799 --> 03:16.676
So in this way, the problems of our country, specially our country, can be solved.

03:16.676 --> 03:18.041
There are many such things

03:18.041 --> 03:21.898
In Sahaja Yoga one can understand. which are the special things we have in our country

03:21.898 --> 03:23.415
What all can be sent abroad

03:23.415 --> 03:26.443
You get a subtle understanding about this.

03:26.443 --> 03:30.000
And with this you see how so many people are sending things abroad.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.062
What all is being done

03:31.062 --> 03:33.181
And you all will also prosper

03:33.181 --> 03:37.106
because you get this subtle understanding

03:37.106 --> 03:44.582
In every way due to an individual personality become a part of the Whole

03:44.582 --> 03:50.538
all the hidden qualities which are within him starts getting enlightened

03:50.538 --> 03:52.886
Big big musicians are in Sahaja Yoga

03:52.886 --> 03:56.415
Big big artists are in Sahaja Yoga

03:56.415 --> 03:59.841
Our commander-in-chief is also in Sahaja yoga

03:59.841 --> 04:05.580
In this way, this thing is like this that when a person achieve this state

04:05.580 --> 04:08.212
he achieves a state called " Parama Pad" (the supreme status)

04:08.212 --> 04:10.475
Every-time we say " parama pad dijiyo means please bless us with the supreme status

04:10.475 --> 04:12.408
This is the "Parama Pad" the Supreme Status

04:16.534 --> 04:19.134
Because this body is filled with energy you don’t need.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.327
Actually, this is the first time the energy is filling you all.

04:22.327 --> 04:24.745
Then you give vibrations.

04:24.745 --> 04:28.087
In Rahuri [Maharashtra state] there called university there they have experimented

04:28.087 --> 04:33.909
In the University for first time they have
experimented in agriculture university with these vibrations

04:33.909 --> 04:41.077
They have found that the growth of all this wheat was 10 ten times more

04:41.077 --> 04:44.620
They have found that the fruits that came out of it were beautiful

04:44.620 --> 04:47.873
and they were so tasty and so lasting

04:47.873 --> 04:50.796
They found that when the cow was given vibrated water

04:50.796 --> 04:55.907
Indian cow started giving milk like an Australian cow

04:55.907 --> 04:59.783
But I cannot write a guarantee check for you

04:59.783 --> 05:01.283
That is one thing.

05:01.283 --> 05:03.289
So all the miseries so called, will drop out

05:12.210 --> 05:16.846
The second power of the second center has the power of creativity

05:16.846 --> 05:21.087
You get the creativity, which is living

05:21.087 --> 05:24.503
So far you never had

05:24.503 --> 05:26.207
we take everything from the nature

05:26.207 --> 05:30.541
We have never given anything to the nature

05:30.541 --> 05:37.417
When this center is enlightened then when you give.. say vibrations to a field of wheat

05:37.417 --> 05:42.958
In India they have done experiments in many universities of Agriculture

05:42.958 --> 05:48.193
and we have many scientists are doing it, they are Sahaja Yogis

05:48.193 --> 06:00.952
and they have found out that the same seed if it is vibrated can produce five times more wheat

06:00.952 --> 06:09.217
not only that but they stored that wheat in a big store where there were other things stored up

06:09.217 --> 06:17.578
And the rats did not touch those bags, Gani bags which contained those wheats.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.000
It’s worth seeing all these

06:20.000 --> 06:28.509
There were cows, Indian cows do not give milk as much as the milk as much as other cows

06:28.509 --> 06:33.034
like, you can say New Zealand or Australian cows

06:33.034 --> 06:37.211
but these two type of foreign cows are extremely aggressive

06:37.211 --> 06:42.618
and their milk make people very, very aggressive

06:42.618 --> 06:44.727
and the taste is not so good

06:44.727 --> 06:47.651
But Indian cows give very nice milk

06:47.651 --> 06:50.947
It doesn’t make people very aggressive and the taste is very good

06:50.947 --> 06:53.593
But the Indian cows when they were given vibrations,

06:53.593 --> 06:57.590
supposing they were giving five seers of milk

06:57.590 --> 07:02.952
they have started giving at least ten  seers or twelve  seers,

07:02.952 --> 07:06.477
not so much as these aggressive ones have give

07:06.477 --> 07:12.527
but their longevity increased

07:12.527 --> 07:23.666
This is how you start giving these enlightened dimensions to things.

07:34.189 --> 07:40.508
Material development is much faster and in balance when you get Self Realization

07:40.508 --> 07:45.103
These vibrations help agriculture very much

07:45.103 --> 07:51.543
We have a scientist, Dr. Hamid, in Austria

07:51.543 --> 07:54.404
who has experimented with vibrations

07:54.404 --> 08:02.647
and has found out that even non-hybrid seeds give you greater yield than the hybrid seeds

08:02.647 --> 08:12.724
In my own field I sowed about 60 kilos of rice in one acre of land

08:12.724 --> 08:15.949
And they told me “It’s a special rice. It won’t grow here”

08:15.949 --> 08:21.455
But it turned out to be 1700 kilos

08:21.455 --> 08:24.076
One of the best rices

08:24.076 --> 08:28.930
And even the sunflower was so big, two feet diameter

08:28.930 --> 08:31.234
You could not lift; one person could not lift

08:31.234 --> 08:35.669
Giving oil six to ten times more!

08:35.669 --> 08:41.580
Do you know, from your country, you are exporting sweet peas

08:41.580 --> 08:45.592
and also sort of pulses to India

08:45.634 --> 08:49.017
Chickpeas also. Millions tones of....

08:49.017 --> 08:51.784
If you vibrate them…

08:51.784 --> 08:52.753
Better do it fast

08:52.753 --> 08:58.518
If Indians start doing it, they may not import

09:17.390 --> 09:21.806
Now our country is of farmers so, I told everyone that do Sahaj yoga,

09:21.922 --> 09:25.548
use vibrated water for farming,

09:25.629 --> 09:31.514
come to Sahaj yoga by which your yield can increase up to ten times.

09:31.713 --> 09:33.805
But people do not listen.

09:34.275 --> 09:38.153
Many Agriculture University people also did big research

09:38.234 --> 09:42.148
and the news spread everywhere that such a thing can happen.

09:42.321 --> 09:53.286
Even from Austria a very famous Mr. Hamid, Dr. Hamid has come for this.

09:53.429 --> 09:55.505
He was an advisor in UNO.

09:55.608 --> 10:00.858
He also did experiments and explained to everyone

10:00.985 --> 10:06.041
but don’t know what’s the matter that this doesn’t go into the heads of people.

10:06.104 --> 10:08.726
As if their brains are not alright.

10:08.822 --> 10:11.894
Try to do farming this way and see for yourself.

10:11.937 --> 10:15.329
If you see ten farms and one farm is full of greenery

10:15.413 --> 10:18.998
then understand for sure that this is a farm of some Sahaj yogi.

10:19.296 --> 10:22.752
In everything, also we have seen, in animal husbandry.

10:22.867 --> 10:27.795
We did experiments and were told that one cow gives up to ten litres of milk.

10:27.971 --> 10:30.571
Surprisingly, it’s about our Indian cow

10:30.780 --> 10:36.284
and even the seeds which they use are not the seeds brought from the shops or anywhere

10:36.378 --> 10:38.058
but commonly used seeds,

10:38.139 --> 10:40.539
so much was produced from that seed,

10:40.620 --> 10:44.030
but nobody is ready to listen.

10:46.662 --> 10:49.462
In this India, if you call a newspaperman,

10:49.543 --> 10:53.767
they only notice that there was a carpet spread out at your place,

10:53.848 --> 10:56.856
there was a lamp was illuminated at your place.

10:56.937 --> 11:01.161
There is nothing beyond that. They don’t see anything beyond that.

11:01.242 --> 11:02.922
They don’t hear anything,

11:03.003 --> 11:08.379
they don’t write anything instead they write some silly things which has no meaning.

11:08.460 --> 11:11.404
We have brought such a great thing before you,

11:11.492 --> 11:13.425
at least listen to something.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.960
But they are not ready to listen to anything.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.587
Don’t know what kind of brain people have here!
