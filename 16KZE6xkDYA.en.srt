1
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:11,896
Keep your eyes  closed.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,340
First of all, please put your
right hand on your heart.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,220
All the time, the left hand is towards Me.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,020
Now.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:31,740
Here you have to say, in your heart, with
all sincerity “Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,080
Ask the question three times in your heart.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,600
This is a very fundamental question.

8
00:00:55,767 --> 00:01:06,037
Now bring the right hand onto the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,180
Here press it.

10
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,941
Now, this is the centre of your mastery,

11
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:21,698
your guidance, your ‘Guru Tattwa’ as they say.
So ask a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,356
This is a question to be asked three
times, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

13
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:49,579
Now, bring your right hand down below,
in the lower part of the abdomen.

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:02:00,292
Now, this is the centre from which all the
divine work is done, all the pure work is done.

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,700
So to ask Me six times, because
this centre has got six petals.

16
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,360
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge."

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,126
Six times you just ask.

18
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,252
As a result of this asking, the
Kundalini starts getting awakened.

19
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,340
Now to help the Kundalini to rise,
you have to cooperate with her.

20
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,420
So please, put your right
hand on the left-hand side,

21
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:47,760
in the upper part of your abdomen and
press it, on your stomach.

22
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:57,000
Now here you have to say with full
confidence, to help the Kundalini to rise,

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,900
“Mother, I am my own master."

24
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,506
This you have to say ten times.

25
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:12,348
These are the Ten Commandments which you have
to say, that, “Mother, I am my own master."

26
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,773
Ten times with full confidence.

27
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,130
Now, please raise your right hand to your heart.

28
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:13,625
Now, here you have to say, again with full
confidence, “Mother, I am the Spirit."

29
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,019
This is the truth, you are the Spirit,

30
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,537
but you have to say with full
confidence, “Mother, I am the Spirit."

31
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,232
This you have to say twelve times.

32
00:04:53,598 --> 00:05:00,678
Now, one has to know that God
Almighty is the ocean of love.

33
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,680
But above all, He’s the ocean of forgiveness.

34
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,420
So He forgives; whatever wrong you do He forgives.

35
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,621
So don’t feel guilty and
put your right hand across,

36
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:25,671
on the left-hand side, in the corner which
is made by your neck and your shoulder.

37
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,180
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

38
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,200
sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty."

39
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,380
Please say it, “Mother, I am not guilty."

40
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,469
Sixteen times.

41
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,480
“I’m not guilty at all."

42
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,420
Please say it.

43
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,733
Please say it.

44
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,174
Very hot.

45
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,768
Now raise your hand across on your forehead.

46
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,292
And is a very important centre.

47
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:42,703
Here you have to say from your
heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone."

48
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,760
Please say it from your heart.

49
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,680
How many times, is not the point.

50
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,055
“Mother, I forgive everyone."

51
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:55,020
You know some would say that
is very difficult to forgive.

52
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:03,905
But it’s a myth that we do not forgive or we
forgive, we do not do anything in both the cases.

53
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:07,860
But if we don’t forgive, then
we play into wrong hands.

54
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,140
So please say from your heart,
“Mother, I forgive everyone."

55
00:07:22,337 --> 00:07:29,400
Now please take your hand on the Back Agnya,
the same centre on the backside of your head,

56
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,020
and allow your head to rest on
it and push it back a little bit.

57
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:44,520
Now here you have to say, for your satisfaction
because you always feel guilty, that,

58
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,438
“Oh, Divine, if I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me."

59
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,836
“Please, forgive me."

60
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,793
From your heart.

61
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:15,300
Stretch your hand fully and put your centre
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

62
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,502
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

63
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:28,522
Press it hard, press hard your scalp.
Now you have to move it seven times,

64
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:36,040
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,
“Mother, please, give us my Self-realization."

65
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,905
Because I cannot force on
you, so you’ve to ask for it.

66
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,838
Seven times, press it hard
and move it seven times.

67
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:46,185
Very hard.

68
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,160
Slowly.

69
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,211
Saying that.
