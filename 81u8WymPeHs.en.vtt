1991_03_31 Easter Puja, Sydney, Australia_81u8WymPeHs

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.080
Today we are here to

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.000
worship Christ as He was resurrected

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.240
from dead.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.040
There are lots of theories

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.560
about His death,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560
but actually

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.000
He resurrected Himself

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.640
and then

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.960
He went down to India and settled there

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.600
with His Mother.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.600
The after-period of His Resurrection is not described

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.000
in any books as such, but

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.640
in the,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.080
one of the Puranas,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080
written about Shalivahana,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.960
one of the kings of dynasty I being to,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.000
has met Christ in Kashmir,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.040
and he asked Him, ''What's Your name?''

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.960
He said, ''My name is Issa.''

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.960
And he then he asked Him also

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.960
that: ''From which country You come, which place?''

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.840
He said: ''I come from a country

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.880
which is foreign to you and to Me,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.960
and now I'm here in My own country.''

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.040
That's how He appreciated, I think, the Indian thing.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.640
And then He used to cure people there,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.600
and His tomb is there and His Mother's tomb also is there.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.960
So there are other stories also

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640
created by people who did not know much about Him.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.960
But whatever it is, what you find,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.960
that Christ was very much impressed,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.080
and was very much there to teach about morality

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.040
as in the Indian Scriptures, very strongly.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.040
For Him morality was the most important thing in life,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.960
because as you know,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.040
He was the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.040
So for Him Ganesha's principle was extremely important.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.600
And that He has expressed by saying that:

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.120
''In the Ten Commandments it is said

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.080
that 'Thou shalt not commit adultery',

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.960
but I verily say to you,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.960
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.'''

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.120
To such an extent

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.000
that even the eyes should not be adulterous.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.560
itâ€™s a very good understanding

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.960
of a personality,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.080
where we find in the modern times,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.040
most of them have their attention

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.560
moving up and down, with adultery.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160
Also in one of the Upanishads I read

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.560
that even to look at a woman is adultery,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.160
even to think of a woman is adultery,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.120
and talk to women too much is also adultery.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.960
These modern times I have seen there are women

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.160
who are used as public relations,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.000
everywhere, in every country.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
When they just go and chit-chat

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.160
and talk to people in position,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.120
and talk in such a manner

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.200
that they feel very much pampered.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.080
And one of the ways of getting favors,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.000
wrong favors, from officers,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.120
is through this kind of P.R. business,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.960
it's very common.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.040
And this is what is responsible also partly

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.640
for the corruption in many countries.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.120
Morality goes hand in hand with all kinds of violence.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.040
Anybody who is a violent person,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.160
a person who is in the mafia,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.080
a person who is regarded as an outcast,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.960
all of them are adulterous people of the worst type.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.040
So one has to understand how important it is,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.040
that morality should be our basic asset in Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.040
Specially I would say we are so lucky to-day,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.960
that it should be celebrated in the land of Shri Ganesha,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.720
that we should be here to celebrate His Resurrection,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.720
which actually is due to His clean,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.080
we can say absolutely Nishkalank life.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.000
Life, which was so pure.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.080
His purity was there because He was nothing but Chaitanya,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.960
He was nothing but vibrations.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.040
He was so pure that He could even walk on the water,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.080
He was so pure that death could not kill Him.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.120
So we have to aim at our purification.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.160
We talk of resurrection,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.000
when we think of getting a second birth.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.160
As I have told you before, that an egg becomes a bird,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.080
that's called a ''dwijaha'', it's twice-born.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.200
In the same way we who are covered

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.720
with our ego and our conditionings,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.160
opens out to become a bird,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.600
and that's how we all have come to know about the Brahma,

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.240
about this all-pervading power which is the Brahma.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.000
And that's how we are now really become

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.040
the Dwijahas, meaning the Brahmins.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.000
Those who have not known the Brahma,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.120
without that, what is the use of any worship,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.120
or any kind of chantings or anything,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.080
because you are not connected,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.120
and if you are not connected, it has no meaning.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.960
But we have to look at ourselves,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.960
about purity part of it.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.960
On a very low level of people, you see,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.000
l have seen that the impurity comes

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.160
from what Christ has called as ''murmuring souls''.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.960
These are the people who start talking

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.040
at the back of others,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.200
and just enjoy this kind of talk.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.560
This is a very low type of a personality.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.200
l think in Sahaja Yoga this should go away completely,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.120
because it creates problems,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.960
and the main basic strength of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.160
which is collectivity, is harmed by them.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.080
Specially in this respect I would request the women,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.160
specially the wives of the leaders

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.040
have a great responsibility.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.120
lf they start talking like that,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.960
taking interest in such talks,

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.960
then they come down to the level of others,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.000
and their motherhood is challenged.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.120
Any mother who allows the children to talk like that

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:02.040
is really spoiling the entire life of that, of children.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.160
Anybody who talks ill of anybody in Sahaja Yoga

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.200
is really extremely dangerous for both of them,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.000
but specially for the person who does it.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.000
So one should always avoid even thinking ill of others,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.120
let alone the talking of it.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.120
lf anybody talks like that,

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.680
you should put your hands to your ears and say: ''Don't tell me,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.080
l don't want to hear anything against anyone.''

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.720
Because when we start talking against someone,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.760
we get all the bad things that person has.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
Apart from that our mind is spoiled,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.040
is impurity in your mind.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.080
Then you talk to others,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.160
it increases and it becomes worse.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.080
It is the responsibility of the women,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.320
to be very much careful, because

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.040
this kind of thing is more with the women

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.040
because they are a little excluded,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.040
they have exclusive friends,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.200
and they have exclusive life.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.880
They are different type than men are.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.040
Men if they have to get angry with someone

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.440
or if they want to say something

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.000
theyâ€™ll just go and have a fight and finish with it.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.120
But women will keep it in their mind

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.120
and will say something,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.040
and it's such a bad thing to start,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.000
it's just like a worm it moves,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.360
and is very infectious.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.480
So all of you must remember

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.160
that this is the first thing you must avoid,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.960
is to listen against anyone,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.240
talk against anyone, have small talks.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.280
l have said the same thing in Perth,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.960
because last time when I came I found

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.080
horrible things were done against people.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.080
Now again I tell you this,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.160
because we are at a point

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.960
where we have to understand that morality

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.040
is not only about what is the sex is,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.080
but is much more than that, much wider than that.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.080
So because we want to have our purification,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.760
let us have introspection within ourselves.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.680
People ask Me, ''How did You manage so well in Russia?''

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.360
Yes, one thing about Russia is very great,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.080
that they're very introspective.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.960
lf you read any novel of a Russian writer,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.080
youâ€™ll be surprised to see that

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.200
all of them are introspecting,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.960
all the characters are introspective,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.960
they want to see ''Why I do it''.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.080
For example, somebody is lazy.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.040
He doesn't work.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.040
He dedicates his time in reading or something else

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.080
but he cannot put his physical body to any strain.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.960
Then he introspects: ''Why, why am I so lazy?

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.120
Why can't I do something more active?''

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.800
Then somebody who is always sort of difficult,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.080
and angry type,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.120
that people don't like him.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.920
Then instead of getting angry with others,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.520
he has to see himself within himself:

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.200
''Why am I not like that,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.480
why people don't care for me,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.160
what do I have within me

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.120
that is making me so miserable?''

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.000
So youâ€™ll see that you are either conditioned,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.040
or you have a funny ego which is coming up,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.160
and is making you do wrong things

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.760
which you should not do.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.040
That's one of the purifications

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.080
you can have of your mind

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.160
when you start introspecting yourself.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.960
Now as the culture is I find is not very much

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.040
for the benevolence of human beings.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.200
It is, you don't know what people are up to,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.160
what they can do, how far they can go.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.080
Nothing is possible.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.160
l have seen in this, some of the marriages we had,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.120
very shocking things,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.000
that the men or women never told Me,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.160
and they had horrible diseases.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.000
And they just put Me into trouble.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.040
There are many others who have done this kind of thing.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.120
So first thing, you must know

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.480
that you cannot be a hypocrite in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.200
lf you are a hypocrite,

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.160
if you do not sincerely believe in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.000
fully engrossed yourself,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.120
you do not purify yourself and jump into yourself,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.160
then you will be exposed very soon,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.960
and you'll be thrown away from Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.160
no doubt about it.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.160
l will not throw, I will forgive,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.160
but as I have told you there are two forces working in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.160
one is centrifugal and another centripetal.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.040
By centripetal force youâ€™ll be attracted,

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.000
but by centrifugal force youâ€™ll be thrown out.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.080
So one has to be very, very careful,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.040
because whatever you have got

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.960
is something really remarkably,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.160
surprisingly so heavenly, and so easily.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.000
Actually I am surprised at Myself,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.960
how I have achieved all these things,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.120
but it has been achieved, because as I told you,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.040
that the all-pervading power itself

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.120
has taken a dynamic role.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.560
It is acting

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.000
because it is now in, we are in Krita Yuga.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.960
This Krita Yuga comes when there is a gap

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.960
between, from one Yuga to another Yuga.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.080
Like we had Kali Yuga.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.000
Kali Yuga has to go to Satya Yuga,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.120
in between there's Krita Yuga, when this acts

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.120
and evolutionary process have taken place at that time.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.440
So now the last evolution has started and again,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:15.600
this all-pervading power has become

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.600
very dynamic.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.000
That's how you get all My photographs and you get all these things,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.120
and you are also getting people realized,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.160
you yourself, you are surprised

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.200
at the miracles you have.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.000
Everybody can tell you hundreds of miracles.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.000
So these miracles also are worked out

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.960
by this all-pervading power.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.080
At this juncture, when we have all these possibilities

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.960
if we try to be hypocritical we are harming ourselves.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.160
lf we try to criticize others, and not ourselves,

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.120
then we are going to miss the bus.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.720
You must understand the importance of time.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.080
That is something people miss out.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.480
Sahaja Yoga is very good, because you're blessed,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.080
and you feel that you are secured,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.000
things are very good,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.040
you get so many brothers and sisters,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.080
and I see your faces just like roses shining;

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.200
all that is good, but still there is a chance

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.960
that you may fall back.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.080
The reason is, you must purify yourself.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.000
Never get satisfied with yourself.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.160
Some people, when I talk to them, they never think I am talking to them,

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.760
they think I am talking to somebody else.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.080
So please try to understand,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.120
we have to introspect ourselves,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.080
we have to meditate,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.640
and when we are conscious about our own defects,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.160
weâ€™ll start looking at it and theyâ€™ll drop out.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.160
itâ€™s a very tremendous task we have to do,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.120
is to emancipate the whole human beings,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.080
and for that,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.960
you have to be something very special.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.960
You have to be ideal.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.160
People are going to see you.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.000
l have seen some people who are very fond

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.960
of going on the stage and trying to show off.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.960
itâ€™s ego, understand that, it is ego.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.160
lf you are not what you are talking,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.160
nobody is going to take you seriously.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.080
On the contrary they'll disappear from Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.040
lf you are going to show off,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.120
people will say: ''Look at this show-off''

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.640
Everybody can see you being like that.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.640
They may not see themselves,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.280
but they can see another person like that.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.160
So for all these ego manifestations,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.120
you have to be very, very careful.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.160
Now supposing if you have money then youâ€™ll try to show off,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.840
if you have some power, supposing you have certain position in the government,

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.280
youâ€™ll try to show off, anything, these artificial things.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.080
I've known people who show off for absurd things which has no meaning.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.760
l don't understand,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.000
that these all things are outside,

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.880
they are not enriching you,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.680
they are in no way giving you the strength that you need,

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.880
in no way making you beautiful.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.080
So all these outside things anybody can have,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.000
it's nothing great about you,

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.480
but the inner wealth that you develop is the only way

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.040
you can purify yourself, and the resurrection can take place

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:22.080
in the same manner as Christ has said.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.120
Now the time of resurrection has come, you are all resurrected,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:31.200
but you have to still cleanse yourself.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.080
First as I told you, that morality

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.080
should be the highest priority for all of us.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.080
Now just think of the life people lead.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.080
For example, I have been in the West with My husband

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.480
in another atmosphere, another society.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.080
We have been to parties,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.960
we've been to all such things,

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.120
and what I've found, that no man is safe, no woman is safe.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.080
They are all flirting with each other,

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200
God knows for what,

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.040
it's a joyless pursuit.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.120
And when they go back home what they find,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.160
that the wife is missing or the husband is missing.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.160
So such an insecure life they have

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.080
because they have no sense of morality.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.000
To them these pleasures are something great,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.040
and because of this misunderstanding about the

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.960
life,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.160
they are suffering with such tremendous insecurity.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.200
You have to guide your children

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.600
to a proper, sane morality.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.160
For that you must behave properly.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.000
You should not go romantic in the presence of your children,

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.120
you should not try to put them in a way

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.120
that you lock up your rooms and do

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.040
all kinds of things,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.000
but behave in a manner that is dignified.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.680
Otherwise children will pick up from you to begin with.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.120
Then also you should be careful as to the television and things that they show,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.080
or what children see,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.080
they have to be careful, and talk to them that:

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.120
''This is wrong. This is very wrong,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.040
and this will bring problems to us.''

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.960
lf you have a proper rapport with your children

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.120
you won't have any problem.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.080
You see here they have so much of this education,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.640
despite that how many problems you have with children.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.800
While we do not educate children in all these things,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.800
but we don't have these problems in India,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.160
because you are kept just innocent about it.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.120
lf the children are kept innocent

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.080
they never indulge into it,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.960
and they would never get into any problems

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.080
which are created by curiosity.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.160
Never make them curious.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.120
You will feel happy, the children will feel happy,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.160
and theyâ€™ll start their life from the very beginning,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.960
on the basis of morality.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:54.200
This is what you have to give to your children, is a proper moral sense.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.000
Then another thing I have seen is

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.160
that, very important, is to give

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.160
for Sahaja Yoga your time.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.080
Many people do not give their time,

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.200
do not work in the ashrams,

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.120
they do not think that they have to do

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.120
something for Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.200
You must understand that you are part and parcel of one body.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.680
Now supposing I do not allow one hand to work,

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.080
put it in a sling, you'll find it will never work,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.960
it will become weak,

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.200
it will not be able to do anything, it will be wasted.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.120
So you have to use all the limbs of the body

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.040
in the same way, you all must also put in physical,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.000
mental, emotional,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.080
whatever is possible for the work of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.600
because it is your work.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.520
l don't need Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.120
l don't have to do it.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.040
itâ€™s for you I have started this,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.360
and it is for you to give it to others.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.160
itâ€™s your responsibility,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.960
so you should take it up as your own.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.000
For example you know that at this age

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.080
l am traveling every third day or fourth day,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.520
and traveling long distances.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.400
All this I am doing, for what?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.160
There's no need for Me to do,

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.080
l don't need anything.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:23.160
Iâ€™m just doing it because it's supposed to be My life.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.160
l don't know how to explain why I'm doing it really.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:32.080
Logically it doesn't sound sensible.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.440
But if you see Me,

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.040
you say that we have great regard for Mother,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.000
we respect Her very much,

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.160
we are very fond of Her,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.720
and we worship Her, all these things.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.000
But do you give so much as She can give?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.040
How much do we give?

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.000
Secondly, I have also heard

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.000
that people are very miserly in giving money

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.960
for My programs and things.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.000
You want Me to come here.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.040
l used to spend My own money in the early days,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160
but you don't want Me to come here

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.680
with My own money, is it proper? Is it?

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.640
lf you have self-respect you would not like Me to come,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.600
spend My own money coming here,

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.960
and spend money for building this,

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.960
and spend money for your car's petrol.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.960
Would you like Me to do that?

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.120
No.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.960
So there are many people who come to My program,

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.080
l am told, but do not pay for My programs.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160
itâ€™s very wrong.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.160
lf you do not pay, I tell you,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.160
immediately you'll suffer,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.080
and that is in money matters,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.120
because if you do not give, money doesn't come.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.160
Those people who have been generous

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.160
with their hands have been very prosperous,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.000
even in Australia,

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.280
even in India.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.040
So I have to tell you, even this is not a temptation to you,

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.680
but when people say, ''Mother, our thing is not coming up,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.160
this is not working out'',

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.480
so there's something wrong, somewhere wrong.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.160
Once you start dedicating yourself to Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.160
immediately you'll find things will work out.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.120
Something, there is something you have done wrong

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.680
which you should not have done,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.160
or something is, you have not understood,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.160
you have done something under misunderstanding,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.040
try to find out.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.000
Things must sort out.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.080
They must soothe out in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.080
Everything sorts out.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.080
Not only that, but I have seen it just becomes

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.560
absolutely beautifully falling into line,

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.160
and you are amazed how it works out.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.120
From a small thing to big thing.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.960
So if it is not working out in your life,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.040
there's definitely something wrong.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.960
So it is the morality of your,

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.080
l should say, financial morality.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.080
Also there were some horrible mishaps

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.920
we had in this country of yours,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.880
where horrible leaders came

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.720
who were interested only in money,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.000
that's how they came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.240
and what has happened to them, you know that well.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.560
So you don't come to Sahaja Yoga for money,

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.640
you come here for everything,

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.800
in a sense, in totality,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.680
you have to get that higher situation.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.680
Like that you have to

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.960
give also,

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.000
with an open heart.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.160
Know that you have got such a great gift,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.080
so now, what can I do about it?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.160
Of course I don't need your money,

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.520
l am not in the same position as even Christ was,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.160
but He never took any money.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.680
So I need not take any money from you.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.960
But still, for other things,

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.600
those people who have not paid should remember

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.000
that if they want their children to be all right,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.160
if they want their family to be all right, if they want to be

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.160
all right as far as the money is concerned,

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.160
without feeling the ego,

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.000
without pressurizing the leaders,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.640
try to spend money in a way

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.680
that is really useful for Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.160
Then another point is about the family,

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.000
as I told you yesterday, that:

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.840
''My house, I must have my house, I must, yes''.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.720
Specially leaders' wives.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.120
Again I should warn them, because

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.160
all this has created problems to such an extent now,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.760
that we had to throw them out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.800
Despite the fact husbands were very good,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.440
but some women wanted to have their own home,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560
they wanted to have their own children,

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.040
they wanted to stay in their own.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.080
So this kind of a thing if a leaderâ€™s wife has ideas,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.120
then what will happen to others?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.000
They have to follow an example

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.160
that is that of a leader,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.040
and if a leader doesn't have that

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.040
and the wife doesn't have that example,

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.160
the whole thing can be absolutely in a

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.080
state of jeopardy,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.040
and that's what I've seen,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.960
that people suffer so much

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.040
when they do not realize

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.080
that we all are part and parcel of one family.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.160
And we start thinking, imagine,

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.120
we cut one finger and plant it somewhere,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.000
what will grow out of it?

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.960
Will a tree grow out of it?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.640
or what will grow out of it? Nothing. It will stick.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.920
Till you were not joined with that whole thing

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.120
you were all right, whether you were rotting in a place

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.200
or wherever you were, doesn't matter,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.240
but when now you have joined,

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.800
and when you are part and parcel of the family,

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.120
then see how you behave, how your children are.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.040
Are they collective?

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.080
Are they sharing or they are fighting?

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.080
Try to see that your children can share

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.080
their things with others.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.640
And you first of all start doing that,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.880
otherwise children cannot do it.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.960
Now look at Christ,

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:08.040
He lived hardly for four years,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.160
in the sense that He was out of

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.200
that country.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.680
Only for four years He could work out the

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.120
mission that He had to fulfill.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.560
So He was

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.160
only there

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.000
to achieve this resurrection at the Agnya chakra.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.120
In that short period,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.800
how many beautiful parables He has given,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.120
how many places He has been, how many people He has talked to.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.200
All His life He has spent like this.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.080
He lived in a very simple manner,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.960
and He had no such tents, or anything,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.160
so He used to go on mountains and Mount,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.200
you know, Sermon on the Mount is very famous,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.160
sermons are, and then He would gather people there

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.160
and talk with them.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.120
They would listen to Him.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.960
But nobody imbibed anything that He said.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.160
Very few that He had, about twelve disciples,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.080
who also understood Him when He died,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.120
before that they did not understand what He was.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.000
They could not

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.000
visualize actually within their minds,

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.120
''What is He doing,

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.080
what is He talking?''

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.040
But when He was resurrected that made them think:

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.160
''Who was He, and what He has done?

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.160
How is it we are His disciples?''

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.960
And they were ordinary fishermen,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.080
you know that very well,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.960
but their intelligence suddenly manifested,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.120
their dynamism manifested,

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.960
and they really showed such good ways

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.080
of achieving

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.160
what we can call the second birth.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:12.120
Also, Christianity spread under wrong banner

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.160
of Paul and Augustine,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.160
and that's how we see the problems of Christianity.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.080
So much so that we are shocked.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.080
How can Christianity of Christ would be like this?

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.160
But it is,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.080
and this Christianity of Christ that has come

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.800
has nothing to do with Christ.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.200
And He has said it:

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.920
''Youâ€™ll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ,' l won't recognize you.''

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.960
We are the people who are carrying this.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.960
And also He has said that theyâ€™ll be wearing

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.160
a mark on their heads

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.000
and I will know who are the ones.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.000
So, as it is, you are already marked,

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:53.120
you are already been chosen by Christ

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.120
in His Last Judgment,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.080
He has chosen you and you are there,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.040
but still one should know that

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.000
there is all the possibility

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.160
that we could be hypocrites,

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.160
that we are playing with only words,

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:15.160
could be that we still have to cleanse ourselves.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.160
So just put your mind into yourself,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.000
and see for yourself

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.000
that: ''Where have I done wrong?''

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.960
As far as Mooladhara is concerned,

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.120
you people have a special responsibility.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.040
Australians have the greater responsibility

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.040
than anybody else,

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.000
because this is the place of Shri Ganesha.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.000
And if you do not fully understand

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.160
the significance of mooladhara clearing,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.080
Iâ€™m sure you won't be able to achieve

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.160
any height in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.160
So all of you should decide about this,

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.040
and work it out so that there is no problem

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.080
of your ascent, or your rising,

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.080
because you're so pure or so beautiful.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.880
All this you have achieved already,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.200
without much difficulty.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.480
Only thing is if those things which are left behind,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.800
suddenly are trying to come up also,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.240
you should not allow it to come into your life,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.240
you should just throw away.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.960
For example like a lotus leaf,

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.080
when it is under the water it doesn't show anything,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.160
but when it comes up,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.440
then water doesn't stand on that,

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.000
it just falls off.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.080
Doesn't get attached to any water.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.880
You may pour water, any amount - it just takes off.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.920
So this is what you have to find out.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.200
Relationships between each other,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.960
racialism and other things,

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.960
we have to just oppose it.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.360
itâ€™s not a good thing to hate anyone

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.120
for anything small like that.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.960
The forgiving quality of Christ

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.160
at the time when He was crucified has to be remembered.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.040
How He forgave those who crucified Him

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.040
because they do not know what they are doing.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.120
But even when they know

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.120
what they are doing in Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.080
still people try to crucify.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.080
And this crucifixion can be

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.000
all right for the person who is crucified,

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.000
but very dangerous for the person who is crucifying.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.960
So this has to be understood,

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.160
that to get rid of all these things,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.000
and to get out of all your crucifixions,

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.000
you have to have an extremely pure,

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.080
ideal, beautiful life.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.000
You should be proud of your virtues.

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.040
You should be proud of your greatness.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.160
You should be proud that you are so righteous.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.720
There's nothing to feel bad about.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.120
Otherwise people will boast about their bad things

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.160
as in the modern times,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.720
but not about their good things,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.160
regarded as bad manners.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.960
You need not boast of both the things,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.960
but you can be proud

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.040
of the things that are so beautiful,

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.680
so nice, so energy-giving.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.160
Christ had to surrender to the desire of His Father,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.040
and He asked Him that:

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.160
''If You could take away this cup, it would be nice.''

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.960
But when the Father said: ''No,

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.160
you have to drink this cup,''

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.960
He accepted, and He went through it

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.080
very bravely, and beautifully.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.160
We have to have the same kind of surrender,

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.040
that whatever we have to do,

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.200
we should do it with a surrender.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.080
We should not think

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.320
that we are achieving something by that,

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.120
we are showing off by that, or anything.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.120
Just you should feel that it's being done

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.920
because we are surrendering.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.040
We should feel our surrender as a great blessing.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.760
lf you can put your attention to your heart,

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.960
and just say that: ''l surrender myself',

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.200
that's more than sufficient.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.080
But you shouldn't say that: ''Mother, please

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.280
help me to surrender.''

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.120
l mean, how can Mother help you?

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.160
All these prayers sometimes are

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.960
escapes from reality.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.160
''You just help me, help me, this.''

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:42.160
To surrender is very easy.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.000
Just you have to say: ''Mother, come in my heart,

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.080
and come in my head,

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.120
and come in my attention,''

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.080
that's all.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.200
Go on saying like that:

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.160
''Please come in my heart,

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.080
come in my head,

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.240
and come in my attention'',

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.120
and as you would go on saying, Kundalini will rise

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.960
and She will cleanse you completely.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.040
She's the One who cleanses you.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.160
All the time She's cleansing your chakras.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.040
But problem is we always spoil them.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.080
Again and again, poor thing again and again rises and does that.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.120
So all these problems are

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.120
because we are not introspecting.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.560
Also I've seen people are very attach to their wife

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.120
or attached to their husbands,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.080
then they cannot see anybody else.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.040
For them, everything is wrong but for themselves,

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.720
not their husbands or their wives.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.200
This is, seems to be very common failure.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.120
This kind of false attachment

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.120
not only will harm another person,

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.640
but will harm your husband or your wife.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.600
Because they will also get away with wrong things.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.160
Once they start getting away with wrong things, there's no end to it,

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.720
and theyâ€™ll be destroyed.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.000
Now the task before Me is to go to

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.120
area of Visshuddhi, in America,

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.080
which is another very difficult task.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.160
And unless and until that is put right,

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.160
My throat cannot be all right,

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.560
so I have to jolly well do it, and I have to work it out.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.600
But as you know, Americans have

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.120
something wrong with their upper storey.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.080
l just don't understand.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.120
They like people who take money from them

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.960
and who befool them, who have Rolls Royces, all kinds of things,

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.520
can you imagine?

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.960
They would not have Me on the television,

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.800
because I have no Rolls Royce.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.080
l mean, in the television, in the government,

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.080
can you imagine such a television where they don't

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.160
take you up because you have no Rolls Royces?

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:56.680
itâ€™s not prestigious.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.320
lf I have a Rolls Royce by cheating everyone,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.080
then it's very prestigious, it's a business.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.000
So, with all these things happening,

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.040
one feels that the level of spirituality

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.080
is really great

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.160
in a place like Australia

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.160
which is cut off from the world,

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.960
which is so much away.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.120
The spirituality is very well expressed here

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.040
and I'm sure in Sahaja Yoga they will rise very high,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.120
if they keep to one understanding,

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.160
that they are living on the

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.160
soil of Shri Ganesha.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.000
How important it is,

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.040
how you live,

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.960
with what purity

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.960
and with what understanding.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.160
So today is the day of Christ's resurrection,

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.200
you should say, it's a resurrection for all of us.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.160
He has the One, He is the One who managed it, who did everything for us,

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.040
and He's the One who has helped us so much,

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.160
otherwise Kundalini well

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.080
could never have entered into Sahasrara.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.040
So one has to be really very much thankful to Him

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.960
from your heart,

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.080
plus you should try to imbibe His qualities.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.000
One other quality is there, of course,

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.040
that when people try to criticize your Mother

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.160
or try to insult your Mother,

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.080
you get angry, that is just like Christ,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.000
He could not tolerate any insult,

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.200
or any kind of a neglect of His Mother.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.320
He Himself has said that this will not be tolerated.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.080
In the same way you people also,

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.040
if you have only for that, I am with you.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.960
Iâ€™m absolutely with you,

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.160
that you do not have

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:59.800
any more the feeling

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.960
of guilt, or anything within yourself.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.040
When you understand

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.080
that whatever you are doing,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.160
you are doing with complete sincerity,

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.160
with complete understanding.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.960
Even if you make mistakes, it doesn't matter.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.200
The mistake will bring forth something lack,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.040
but you have to be extremely sincere,

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.000
this feeling should be within you.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.080
Look at the feeling of Christ.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.200
l mean, He crucified Himself.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.200
He asked for the trouble.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.400
He went all the way there, there was no need for Him to go,

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.960
enter into that area,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.120
and He got this.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.160
Of course,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.000
you are not going to be crucified

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.120
now for your resurrection, not at all,

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.160
but

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.000
in a way

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.600
you have to crucify whatever is ugly,

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.160
whatever is wrong,

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.520
whatever is detrimental to your growth.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.640
You have to become really very beautiful people,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.200
very beautiful.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.040
Anybody who talks to you,

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.120
anybody who sees you should say that:

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.080
''I met such and such person, very beautiful,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.480
and then I asked, 'How is it you're so beautiful?'

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.080
and the person said that 'Iâ€™m a Sahaja Yogini'''.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.680
itâ€™s a very, very common

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.160
experience of Mine,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.080
very common experience.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.800
And the main thing is

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.160
that you have to respect

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.120
your self-realization,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.160
your resurrection has to be respected.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.120
lf you do not respect your resurrection,

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.080
you are not going to help yourself or others.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:55.000
l met once by chance,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:01.200
the High Court Judge of Hague High Court,

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.040
which is a World High Court.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.120
Just in Romania.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.200
He was sitting there.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.000
l was also sitting, and he was looking at Me.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.080
Trying to locate him, I couldn't locate him.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.080
And then we went to Paris,

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.400
and he was also in Paris.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.880
Frankfurt, he was changing, and I was also changing there.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.200
So he just came and asked: ''By the way, have I met You before?''

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.080
l said: ''Maybe.''

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.160
l knew who he was but I kept quiet.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.400
He said: ''You know I'm such and such, and I went to India

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.680
and there was a lady who cured me, are You the one?''

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:42.160
l said: ''Yes, I am such and such''.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.520
All right.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.640
Then what he told Me was most encouraging, was this.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.120
He said: ''That time You cured me I felt gratified,

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.920
l thought You were one of the healers and all that.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.560
But when I saw the life of Dr Nagen,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.480
this is my colleague, the way he's transformed,

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.000
the way he had become such a good man,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.160
such a wonderful person, I asked him once:

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.160
'What, what has made you so good,

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.240
how can you be such a good man in these bad times,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.960
when from every side there's such an attack?'''

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.560
And also he took a very big stand.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.000
'''And what, what was the thing?

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:35.080
What made you such a good person?

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.000
You are living in a place like this,

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.560
and you know how Hague is surrounded by all kinds of criminals

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.160
and drugs and all that.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.000
And you are such a nice, and a beautiful saintly person.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.440
What has made you?'''

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.160
''So then he told me, 'You remember the lady who cured you,

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.120
She has changed me completely.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.960
It is because of Her I have become a Yogi,

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.080
and that's why my life has changed,

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.960
because it gives you the strength.'''

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.200
So this man told Me, I was really very much touched.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.640
So he said: ''Now can I have Your photograph?''

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.440
l said: ''l don't have any photograph.''

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.520
There were three, four Sahaja Yogis with Me, they were wearing the badges,

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.200
but only there was one badge.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.920
But the Secretary of the Hague High Court

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.360
was also with him.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.280
He got so much interested, so he said:

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.880
''Can I have the badge?''

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
So we gave it to this judge, so the other fellow says:

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.040
''What about me? l would also like to have a badge.''

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.400
l said: ''Are you going to carry this badge?''

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.400
''Yes, yes, of course.'' immediately he wore it.

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.720
Suddenly Mathias found another badge,

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.680
but they had gone to the airplane.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.080
Then he ran there and he told the air hostess:

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.400
''Give it to the gentleman.''

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.440
''Ah, I saw one with this badge. All right,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.400
Iâ€™ll give it to the other.'' And she took it inside.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.120
Can you imagine these people of such high society,

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.160
l should say, so highly placed in life,

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.080
such intellectuals,

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.080
they are the judges of the Supreme High Court,

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.120
in the sense that it's the super, most

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.080
High Court in Hague, World High Court,

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.960
and so humbled down, because

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.760
of one person whom they saw so changed.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.200
So you can imagine how you can change your colleagues,

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.200
how you can show better results

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.080
by your proper dignified behavior.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.160
itâ€™s going to work out very well if you have that example.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.160
And Christ, why He impressed people so much?

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.240
Because of His personal life.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.200
In His personal life He showed

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.160
how powerful He was,

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.120
and then, and His death, He showed

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.000
by His resurrection that He was something

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.000
beyond human comprehension,

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.160
where He has just become

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.080
resurrected after death.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.160
Must be that He was absolutely purity personified,

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.080
which He was.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.800
So today we have to place ourselves

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.000
in such a manner

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.960
that we ask for purity, and purity, and purity,

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.960
and that we are going to work out

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.080
this purity within ourselves with full sincerity.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.160
We are not going to get into ego trip,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.080
and think that we are perfectly all right. No,

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.040
we are just going to ask

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.960
for complete purity within ourselves.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.520
This is what the great, what Christ has given us,

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.160
which we should achieve,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.960
and we should really show

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.960
that we can achieve that purity within ourselves.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.120
Whatever has happened you forget it,

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.000
you don't worry on that point,

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.520
whatever has happened is a gone case,

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.240
but whatever has to happen is this,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:49.640
that you all should ask for purity,

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.240
all criticism, all hatred

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.160
and all those things will disappear,

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.000
plus the purity will give you

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.960
that unique position

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.080
that when people will even see your life,

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.200
they will change.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.720
Only by seeing your life, they will change.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.680
l hope this works out very well here,

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.160
and maybe by the time I come next time,

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.680
weâ€™ll have lots, lots of Sahaja Yogis,

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.000
beautifully connected to each other,

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.120
beautifully having relations with each other,

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:25.000
and these children growing up

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.040
very fast as well.

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.080
l hope to come back here

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.080
again to the land of Shri Ganesha

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.080
where Purity has taken over.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.720
May God Bless You.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:48.040
Easter Puja is a simple Puja in a way,

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.640
because we just...

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.080
of course the Footwashing has to be there by children,

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.040
because that's the special day today,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:09.120
but otherwise it's a much simpler Puja,

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.080
and it doesn't take all those things that

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.160
we normally do.
