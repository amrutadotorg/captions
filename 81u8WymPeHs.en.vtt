1991_03_31 Easter Puja, Sydney, Australia_81u8WymPeHs

00:11.560 --> 00:15.080
Today we are here to

00:19.520 --> 00:25.000
worship Christ as He was resurrected

00:25.720 --> 00:28.240
from dead.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.040
There are lots of theories

00:32.120 --> 00:35.560
about His death,

00:36.120 --> 00:39.560
but actually

00:42.120 --> 00:45.000
He resurrected Himself

00:45.120 --> 00:47.640
and then

00:48.080 --> 00:50.960
He went down to India and settled there

00:51.040 --> 00:53.600
with His Mother.

00:55.080 --> 01:01.600
The after-period of His Resurrection is not described

01:02.040 --> 01:05.000
in any books as such, but

01:05.080 --> 01:07.640
in the,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.080
one of the Puranas,

01:10.080 --> 01:12.080
written about Shalivahana,

01:12.080 --> 01:16.960
one of the kings of dynasty I being to,

01:17.040 --> 01:22.000
has met Christ in Kashmir,

01:22.080 --> 01:25.040
and he asked Him, ''What's Your name?''

01:25.160 --> 01:27.960
He said, ''My name is Issa.''

01:28.080 --> 01:30.960
And he then he asked Him also

01:31.080 --> 01:33.960
that: ''From which country You come, which place?''

01:34.120 --> 01:36.840
He said: ''I come from a country

01:36.960 --> 01:39.880
which is foreign to you and to Me,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.960
and now I'm here in My own country.''

01:43.080 --> 01:48.040
That's how He appreciated, I think, the Indian thing.

01:48.160 --> 01:52.640
And then He used to cure people there,

01:53.080 --> 01:58.600
and His tomb is there and His Mother's tomb also is there.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.960
So there are other stories also

02:03.080 --> 02:07.640
created by people who did not know much about Him.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.960
But whatever it is, what you find,

02:14.080 --> 02:17.960
that Christ was very much impressed,

02:18.080 --> 02:22.080
and was very much there to teach about morality

02:22.080 --> 02:27.040
as in the Indian Scriptures, very strongly.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.040
For Him morality was the most important thing in life,

02:32.160 --> 02:33.960
because as you know,

02:34.080 --> 02:37.040
He was the Incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

02:37.120 --> 02:43.040
So for Him Ganesha's principle was extremely important.

02:43.160 --> 02:49.600
And that He has expressed by saying that:

02:50.080 --> 02:52.120
''In the Ten Commandments it is said

02:52.120 --> 02:55.080
that 'Thou shalt not commit adultery',

02:55.080 --> 02:56.960
but I verily say to you,

02:57.080 --> 03:00.960
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.'''

03:01.080 --> 03:02.120
To such an extent

03:02.120 --> 03:06.000
that even the eyes should not be adulterous.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.560
it’s a very good understanding

03:10.080 --> 03:12.960
of a personality,

03:13.080 --> 03:19.080
where we find in the modern times,

03:19.080 --> 03:22.040
most of them have their attention

03:22.040 --> 03:25.560
moving up and down, with adultery.

03:26.160 --> 03:30.160
Also in one of the Upanishads I read

03:30.240 --> 03:32.560
that even to look at a woman is adultery,

03:33.200 --> 03:36.160
even to think of a woman is adultery,

03:36.240 --> 03:41.120
and talk to women too much is also adultery.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.960
These modern times I have seen there are women

03:45.080 --> 03:47.160
who are used as public relations,

03:47.240 --> 03:51.000
everywhere, in every country.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.080
When they just go and chit-chat

03:53.200 --> 03:55.160
and talk to people in position,

03:55.280 --> 03:57.120
and talk in such a manner

03:57.240 --> 04:00.200
that they feel very much pampered.

04:00.280 --> 04:06.080
And one of the ways of getting favors,

04:06.160 --> 04:09.000
wrong favors, from officers,

04:09.120 --> 04:12.120
is through this kind of P.R. business,

04:12.160 --> 04:13.960
it's very common.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.040
And this is what is responsible also partly

04:18.120 --> 04:22.640
for the corruption in many countries.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.120
Morality goes hand in hand with all kinds of violence.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.040
Anybody who is a violent person,

04:33.120 --> 04:35.160
a person who is in the mafia,

04:35.280 --> 04:39.080
a person who is regarded as an outcast,

04:39.160 --> 04:45.960
all of them are adulterous people of the worst type.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.040
So one has to understand how important it is,

04:49.120 --> 04:55.040
that morality should be our basic asset in Sahaja Yoga.

04:55.160 --> 05:00.040
Specially I would say we are so lucky to-day,

05:00.120 --> 05:04.960
that it should be celebrated in the land of Shri Ganesha,

05:05.080 --> 05:09.720
that we should be here to celebrate His Resurrection,

05:10.080 --> 05:16.720
which actually is due to His clean,

05:17.240 --> 05:21.080
we can say absolutely Nishkalank life.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.000
Life, which was so pure.

05:25.080 --> 05:30.080
His purity was there because He was nothing but Chaitanya,

05:30.160 --> 05:32.960
He was nothing but vibrations.

05:33.080 --> 05:40.040
He was so pure that He could even walk on the water,

05:40.120 --> 05:44.080
He was so pure that death could not kill Him.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.120
So we have to aim at our purification.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.160
We talk of resurrection,

05:49.280 --> 05:53.000
when we think of getting a second birth.

05:53.120 --> 05:58.160
As I have told you before, that an egg becomes a bird,

05:58.240 --> 06:02.080
that's called a ''dwijaha'', it's twice-born.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.200
In the same way we who are covered

06:04.320 --> 06:07.720
with our ego and our conditionings,

06:07.840 --> 06:10.160
opens out to become a bird,

06:10.240 --> 06:13.600
and that's how we all have come to know about the Brahma,

06:13.720 --> 06:17.240
about this all-pervading power which is the Brahma.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.000
And that's how we are now really become

06:20.120 --> 06:22.040
the Dwijahas, meaning the Brahmins.

06:22.160 --> 06:26.000
Those who have not known the Brahma,

06:26.080 --> 06:30.120
without that, what is the use of any worship,

06:30.240 --> 06:34.120
or any kind of chantings or anything,

06:34.200 --> 06:36.080
because you are not connected,

06:36.200 --> 06:40.120
and if you are not connected, it has no meaning.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.960
But we have to look at ourselves,

06:43.080 --> 06:45.960
about purity part of it.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.960
On a very low level of people, you see,

06:49.080 --> 06:52.000
l have seen that the impurity comes

06:52.080 --> 06:56.160
from what Christ has called as ''murmuring souls''.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.960
These are the people who start talking

07:00.080 --> 07:02.040
at the back of others,

07:02.160 --> 07:05.200
and just enjoy this kind of talk.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.560
This is a very low type of a personality.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.200
l think in Sahaja Yoga this should go away completely,

07:11.320 --> 07:16.120
because it creates problems,

07:16.240 --> 07:21.960
and the main basic strength of Sahaja Yoga

07:22.080 --> 07:25.160
which is collectivity, is harmed by them.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.080
Specially in this respect I would request the women,

07:29.160 --> 07:34.160
specially the wives of the leaders

07:34.240 --> 07:37.040
have a great responsibility.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.120
lf they start talking like that,

07:39.200 --> 07:42.960
taking interest in such talks,

07:43.040 --> 07:46.960
then they come down to the level of others,

07:47.080 --> 07:50.000
and their motherhood is challenged.

07:50.080 --> 07:56.120
Any mother who allows the children to talk like that

07:56.200 --> 08:02.040
is really spoiling the entire life of that, of children.

08:02.160 --> 08:06.160
Anybody who talks ill of anybody in Sahaja Yoga

08:06.240 --> 08:11.200
is really extremely dangerous for both of them,

08:11.280 --> 08:15.000
but specially for the person who does it.

08:15.120 --> 08:21.000
So one should always avoid even thinking ill of others,

08:21.080 --> 08:23.120
let alone the talking of it.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.120
lf anybody talks like that,

08:25.240 --> 08:30.680
you should put your hands to your ears and say: ''Don't tell me,

08:30.800 --> 08:33.080
l don't want to hear anything against anyone.''

08:33.200 --> 08:40.720
Because when we start talking against someone,

08:42.160 --> 08:46.760
we get all the bad things that person has.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.160
Apart from that our mind is spoiled,

08:50.280 --> 08:54.040
is impurity in your mind.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.080
Then you talk to others,

08:56.160 --> 08:59.160
it increases and it becomes worse.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.080
It is the responsibility of the women,

09:02.160 --> 09:04.320
to be very much careful, because

09:04.440 --> 09:07.040
this kind of thing is more with the women

09:07.160 --> 09:11.040
because they are a little excluded,

09:11.160 --> 09:13.040
they have exclusive friends,

09:13.120 --> 09:15.200
and they have exclusive life.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.880
They are different type than men are.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.040
Men if they have to get angry with someone

09:21.160 --> 09:22.440
or if they want to say something

09:22.560 --> 09:25.000
they’ll just go and have a fight and finish with it.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.120
But women will keep it in their mind

09:27.240 --> 09:29.120
and will say something,

09:29.200 --> 09:33.040
and it's such a bad thing to start,

09:33.160 --> 09:36.000
it's just like a worm it moves,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.360
and is very infectious.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.480
So all of you must remember

09:40.600 --> 09:43.160
that this is the first thing you must avoid,

09:43.280 --> 09:45.960
is to listen against anyone,

09:46.080 --> 09:49.240
talk against anyone, have small talks.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.280
l have said the same thing in Perth,

09:51.400 --> 09:53.960
because last time when I came I found

09:54.080 --> 09:58.080
horrible things were done against people.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.080
Now again I tell you this,

10:00.160 --> 10:03.160
because we are at a point

10:03.240 --> 10:06.960
where we have to understand that morality

10:07.080 --> 10:11.040
is not only about what is the sex is,

10:11.120 --> 10:16.080
but is much more than that, much wider than that.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.080
So because we want to have our purification,

10:20.160 --> 10:22.760
let us have introspection within ourselves.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.680
People ask Me, ''How did You manage so well in Russia?''

10:26.800 --> 10:29.360
Yes, one thing about Russia is very great,

10:29.480 --> 10:32.080
that they're very introspective.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.960
lf you read any novel of a Russian writer,

10:36.040 --> 10:38.080
you’ll be surprised to see that

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
all of them are introspecting,

10:40.280 --> 10:42.960
all the characters are introspective,

10:43.080 --> 10:45.960
they want to see ''Why I do it''.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.080
For example, somebody is lazy.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.040
He doesn't work.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.040
He dedicates his time in reading or something else

10:53.120 --> 10:58.080
but he cannot put his physical body to any strain.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.960
Then he introspects: ''Why, why am I so lazy?

11:03.080 --> 11:06.120
Why can't I do something more active?''

11:06.200 --> 11:11.800
Then somebody who is always sort of difficult,

11:12.080 --> 11:14.080
and angry type,

11:14.160 --> 11:16.120
that people don't like him.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.920
Then instead of getting angry with others,

11:19.040 --> 11:21.520
he has to see himself within himself:

11:21.640 --> 11:23.200
''Why am I not like that,

11:23.280 --> 11:25.480
why people don't care for me,

11:25.600 --> 11:27.160
what do I have within me

11:27.280 --> 11:30.120
that is making me so miserable?''

11:30.200 --> 11:34.000
So you’ll see that you are either conditioned,

11:34.080 --> 11:37.040
or you have a funny ego which is coming up,

11:37.160 --> 11:40.160
and is making you do wrong things

11:40.240 --> 11:43.760
which you should not do.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.040
That's one of the purifications

11:47.120 --> 11:49.080
you can have of your mind

11:49.200 --> 11:53.160
when you start introspecting yourself.

11:53.280 --> 11:58.960
Now as the culture is I find is not very much

11:59.080 --> 12:03.040
for the benevolence of human beings.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.200
It is, you don't know what people are up to,

12:06.280 --> 12:09.160
what they can do, how far they can go.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.080
Nothing is possible.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.160
l have seen in this, some of the marriages we had,

12:14.240 --> 12:16.120
very shocking things,

12:16.240 --> 12:21.000
that the men or women never told Me,

12:21.080 --> 12:25.160
and they had horrible diseases.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.000
And they just put Me into trouble.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.040
There are many others who have done this kind of thing.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.120
So first thing, you must know

12:33.240 --> 12:35.480
that you cannot be a hypocrite in Sahaja Yoga.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.200
lf you are a hypocrite,

12:37.320 --> 12:40.160
if you do not sincerely believe in Sahaja Yoga,

12:40.280 --> 12:43.000
fully engrossed yourself,

12:43.120 --> 12:46.120
you do not purify yourself and jump into yourself,

12:46.200 --> 12:49.160
then you will be exposed very soon,

12:49.240 --> 12:52.960
and you'll be thrown away from Sahaja Yoga,

12:53.040 --> 12:54.160
no doubt about it.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.160
l will not throw, I will forgive,

12:57.240 --> 13:01.160
but as I have told you there are two forces working in Sahaja Yoga,

13:01.280 --> 13:04.160
one is centrifugal and another centripetal.

13:04.240 --> 13:07.040
By centripetal force you’ll be attracted,

13:07.160 --> 13:11.000
but by centrifugal force you’ll be thrown out.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.080
So one has to be very, very careful,

13:14.160 --> 13:16.040
because whatever you have got

13:16.160 --> 13:19.960
is something really remarkably,

13:20.040 --> 13:24.160
surprisingly so heavenly, and so easily.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.000
Actually I am surprised at Myself,

13:27.080 --> 13:29.960
how I have achieved all these things,

13:30.080 --> 13:33.120
but it has been achieved, because as I told you,

13:33.240 --> 13:36.040
that the all-pervading power itself

13:36.120 --> 13:40.120
has taken a dynamic role.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.560
It is acting

13:44.040 --> 13:48.000
because it is now in, we are in Krita Yuga.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.960
This Krita Yuga comes when there is a gap

13:51.080 --> 13:53.960
between, from one Yuga to another Yuga.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.080
Like we had Kali Yuga.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.000
Kali Yuga has to go to Satya Yuga,

13:58.120 --> 14:01.120
in between there's Krita Yuga, when this acts

14:01.200 --> 14:06.120
and evolutionary process have taken place at that time.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.440
So now the last evolution has started and again,

14:09.560 --> 14:15.600
this all-pervading power has become

14:15.720 --> 14:18.600
very dynamic.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.000
That's how you get all My photographs and you get all these things,

14:23.120 --> 14:26.120
and you are also getting people realized,

14:26.200 --> 14:28.160
you yourself, you are surprised

14:28.280 --> 14:30.200
at the miracles you have.

14:30.280 --> 14:34.000
Everybody can tell you hundreds of miracles.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.000
So these miracles also are worked out

14:36.120 --> 14:39.960
by this all-pervading power.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.080
At this juncture, when we have all these possibilities

14:44.160 --> 14:48.960
if we try to be hypocritical we are harming ourselves.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.160
lf we try to criticize others, and not ourselves,

14:52.240 --> 14:55.120
then we are going to miss the bus.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.720
You must understand the importance of time.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.080
That is something people miss out.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.480
Sahaja Yoga is very good, because you're blessed,

15:03.600 --> 15:06.080
and you feel that you are secured,

15:06.160 --> 15:08.000
things are very good,

15:08.120 --> 15:10.040
you get so many brothers and sisters,

15:10.160 --> 15:13.080
and I see your faces just like roses shining;

15:13.160 --> 15:16.200
all that is good, but still there is a chance

15:16.280 --> 15:18.960
that you may fall back.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.080
The reason is, you must purify yourself.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.000
Never get satisfied with yourself.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.160
Some people, when I talk to them, they never think I am talking to them,

15:28.240 --> 15:30.760
they think I am talking to somebody else.

15:30.880 --> 15:33.080
So please try to understand,

15:33.200 --> 15:35.120
we have to introspect ourselves,

15:35.240 --> 15:37.080
we have to meditate,

15:37.200 --> 15:42.640
and when we are conscious about our own defects,

15:43.120 --> 15:46.160
we’ll start looking at it and they’ll drop out.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.160
it’s a very tremendous task we have to do,

15:49.200 --> 15:52.120
is to emancipate the whole human beings,

15:52.240 --> 15:54.080
and for that,

15:54.160 --> 15:56.960
you have to be something very special.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.960
You have to be ideal.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.160
People are going to see you.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.000
l have seen some people who are very fond

16:03.080 --> 16:06.960
of going on the stage and trying to show off.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.960
it’s ego, understand that, it is ego.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.160
lf you are not what you are talking,

16:12.240 --> 16:14.160
nobody is going to take you seriously.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.080
On the contrary they'll disappear from Sahaja Yoga.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.040
lf you are going to show off,

16:20.120 --> 16:22.120
people will say: ''Look at this show-off''

16:22.240 --> 16:24.640
Everybody can see you being like that.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.640
They may not see themselves,

16:26.760 --> 16:29.280
but they can see another person like that.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.160
So for all these ego manifestations,

16:33.200 --> 16:35.120
you have to be very, very careful.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.160
Now supposing if you have money then you’ll try to show off,

16:38.280 --> 16:41.840
if you have some power, supposing you have certain position in the government,

16:41.960 --> 16:45.280
you’ll try to show off, anything, these artificial things.

16:45.400 --> 16:51.080
I've known people who show off for absurd things which has no meaning.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.760
l don't understand,

16:53.880 --> 16:57.000
that these all things are outside,

16:57.120 --> 16:58.880
they are not enriching you,

16:58.960 --> 17:02.680
they are in no way giving you the strength that you need,

17:02.800 --> 17:04.880
in no way making you beautiful.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.080
So all these outside things anybody can have,

17:08.160 --> 17:10.000
it's nothing great about you,

17:10.120 --> 17:13.480
but the inner wealth that you develop is the only way

17:13.600 --> 17:18.040
you can purify yourself, and the resurrection can take place

17:18.120 --> 17:22.080
in the same manner as Christ has said.

17:22.160 --> 17:26.120
Now the time of resurrection has come, you are all resurrected,

17:26.200 --> 17:31.200
but you have to still cleanse yourself.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.080
First as I told you, that morality

17:34.160 --> 17:37.080
should be the highest priority for all of us.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.080
Now just think of the life people lead.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.080
For example, I have been in the West with My husband

17:43.160 --> 17:46.480
in another atmosphere, another society.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.080
We have been to parties,

17:48.200 --> 17:49.960
we've been to all such things,

17:50.080 --> 17:54.120
and what I've found, that no man is safe, no woman is safe.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.080
They are all flirting with each other,

17:56.200 --> 17:57.200
God knows for what,

17:57.240 --> 17:59.040
it's a joyless pursuit.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
And when they go back home what they find,

18:01.200 --> 18:04.160
that the wife is missing or the husband is missing.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.160
So such an insecure life they have

18:06.280 --> 18:09.080
because they have no sense of morality.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.000
To them these pleasures are something great,

18:12.080 --> 18:15.040
and because of this misunderstanding about the

18:15.120 --> 18:18.960
life,

18:19.040 --> 18:24.160
they are suffering with such tremendous insecurity.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.200
You have to guide your children

18:26.280 --> 18:30.600
to a proper, sane morality.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.160
For that you must behave properly.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.000
You should not go romantic in the presence of your children,

18:37.080 --> 18:39.120
you should not try to put them in a way

18:39.200 --> 18:41.120
that you lock up your rooms and do

18:41.200 --> 18:43.040
all kinds of things,

18:43.160 --> 18:46.000
but behave in a manner that is dignified.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.680
Otherwise children will pick up from you to begin with.

18:48.800 --> 18:53.120
Then also you should be careful as to the television and things that they show,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.080
or what children see,

18:55.160 --> 18:58.080
they have to be careful, and talk to them that:

18:58.160 --> 19:00.120
''This is wrong. This is very wrong,

19:00.240 --> 19:03.040
and this will bring problems to us.''

19:03.160 --> 19:05.960
lf you have a proper rapport with your children

19:06.080 --> 19:08.120
you won't have any problem.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.080
You see here they have so much of this education,

19:11.160 --> 19:14.640
despite that how many problems you have with children.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.800
While we do not educate children in all these things,

19:17.920 --> 19:19.800
but we don't have these problems in India,

19:19.920 --> 19:22.160
because you are kept just innocent about it.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.120
lf the children are kept innocent

19:24.240 --> 19:26.080
they never indulge into it,

19:26.160 --> 19:29.960
and they would never get into any problems

19:30.080 --> 19:34.080
which are created by curiosity.

19:34.200 --> 19:38.160
Never make them curious.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.120
You will feel happy, the children will feel happy,

19:41.240 --> 19:46.160
and they’ll start their life from the very beginning,

19:46.240 --> 19:48.960
on the basis of morality.

19:49.080 --> 19:54.200
This is what you have to give to your children, is a proper moral sense.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.000
Then another thing I have seen is

19:57.080 --> 20:02.160
that, very important, is to give

20:02.240 --> 20:05.160
for Sahaja Yoga your time.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.080
Many people do not give their time,

20:08.160 --> 20:10.200
do not work in the ashrams,

20:10.280 --> 20:14.120
they do not think that they have to do

20:14.240 --> 20:17.120
something for Sahaja Yoga.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.200
You must understand that you are part and parcel of one body.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.680
Now supposing I do not allow one hand to work,

20:24.800 --> 20:28.080
put it in a sling, you'll find it will never work,

20:28.160 --> 20:29.960
it will become weak,

20:30.080 --> 20:33.200
it will not be able to do anything, it will be wasted.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.120
So you have to use all the limbs of the body

20:36.200 --> 20:41.040
in the same way, you all must also put in physical,

20:41.160 --> 20:43.000
mental, emotional,

20:43.080 --> 20:46.080
whatever is possible for the work of Sahaja Yoga,

20:46.160 --> 20:47.600
because it is your work.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.520
l don't need Sahaja Yoga,

20:49.640 --> 20:51.120
l don't have to do it.

20:51.240 --> 20:54.040
it’s for you I have started this,

20:54.160 --> 20:56.360
and it is for you to give it to others.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.160
it’s your responsibility,

20:58.240 --> 21:01.960
so you should take it up as your own.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.000
For example you know that at this age

21:04.080 --> 21:07.080
l am traveling every third day or fourth day,

21:07.200 --> 21:09.520
and traveling long distances.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.400
All this I am doing, for what?

21:12.520 --> 21:14.160
There's no need for Me to do,

21:14.280 --> 21:16.080
l don't need anything.

21:16.160 --> 21:23.160
I’m just doing it because it's supposed to be My life.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.160
l don't know how to explain why I'm doing it really.

21:26.240 --> 21:32.080
Logically it doesn't sound sensible.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.440
But if you see Me,

21:34.560 --> 21:37.040
you say that we have great regard for Mother,

21:37.120 --> 21:39.000
we respect Her very much,

21:39.080 --> 21:43.160
we are very fond of Her,

21:43.280 --> 21:46.720
and we worship Her, all these things.

21:47.080 --> 21:52.000
But do you give so much as She can give?

21:52.120 --> 21:54.040
How much do we give?

21:54.160 --> 21:57.000
Secondly, I have also heard

21:57.080 --> 22:01.000
that people are very miserly in giving money

22:01.080 --> 22:02.960
for My programs and things.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.000
You want Me to come here.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.040
l used to spend My own money in the early days,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.160
but you don't want Me to come here

22:10.240 --> 22:12.680
with My own money, is it proper? Is it?

22:12.800 --> 22:15.640
lf you have self-respect you would not like Me to come,

22:15.760 --> 22:18.600
spend My own money coming here,

22:18.720 --> 22:20.960
and spend money for building this,

22:21.080 --> 22:23.960
and spend money for your car's petrol.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.960
Would you like Me to do that?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.120
No.

22:27.240 --> 22:30.960
So there are many people who come to My program,

22:31.040 --> 22:34.080
l am told, but do not pay for My programs.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.160
it’s very wrong.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.160
lf you do not pay, I tell you,

22:37.240 --> 22:39.160
immediately you'll suffer,

22:39.280 --> 22:42.080
and that is in money matters,

22:42.160 --> 22:46.120
because if you do not give, money doesn't come.

22:46.240 --> 22:49.160
Those people who have been generous

22:49.240 --> 22:54.160
with their hands have been very prosperous,

22:54.240 --> 22:57.000
even in Australia,

22:57.120 --> 22:58.280
even in India.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.040
So I have to tell you, even this is not a temptation to you,

23:02.160 --> 23:05.680
but when people say, ''Mother, our thing is not coming up,

23:05.800 --> 23:07.160
this is not working out'',

23:07.240 --> 23:10.480
so there's something wrong, somewhere wrong.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.160
Once you start dedicating yourself to Sahaja Yoga,

23:13.280 --> 23:16.160
immediately you'll find things will work out.

23:16.240 --> 23:19.120
Something, there is something you have done wrong

23:19.240 --> 23:20.680
which you should not have done,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.160
or something is, you have not understood,

23:23.280 --> 23:26.160
you have done something under misunderstanding,

23:26.240 --> 23:28.040
try to find out.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.000
Things must sort out.

23:30.080 --> 23:32.080
They must soothe out in Sahaja Yoga.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.080
Everything sorts out.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.080
Not only that, but I have seen it just becomes

23:37.160 --> 23:40.560
absolutely beautifully falling into line,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.160
and you are amazed how it works out.

23:43.240 --> 23:46.120
From a small thing to big thing.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.960
So if it is not working out in your life,

23:49.080 --> 23:52.040
there's definitely something wrong.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.960
So it is the morality of your,

23:56.040 --> 23:58.080
l should say, financial morality.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.080
Also there were some horrible mishaps

24:01.120 --> 24:02.920
we had in this country of yours,

24:03.040 --> 24:04.880
where horrible leaders came

24:05.000 --> 24:06.720
who were interested only in money,

24:06.840 --> 24:09.000
that's how they came to Sahaja Yoga,

24:09.120 --> 24:11.240
and what has happened to them, you know that well.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.560
So you don't come to Sahaja Yoga for money,

24:13.720 --> 24:15.640
you come here for everything,

24:15.840 --> 24:17.800
in a sense, in totality,

24:17.920 --> 24:20.680
you have to get that higher situation.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.680
Like that you have to

24:25.680 --> 24:27.960
give also,

24:28.120 --> 24:30.000
with an open heart.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.160
Know that you have got such a great gift,

24:33.280 --> 24:36.080
so now, what can I do about it?

24:36.120 --> 24:38.160
Of course I don't need your money,

24:38.280 --> 24:41.520
l am not in the same position as even Christ was,

24:41.640 --> 24:43.160
but He never took any money.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.680
So I need not take any money from you.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.960
But still, for other things,

24:48.120 --> 24:50.600
those people who have not paid should remember

24:50.720 --> 24:53.000
that if they want their children to be all right,

24:53.080 --> 24:56.160
if they want their family to be all right, if they want to be

24:56.200 --> 24:58.160
all right as far as the money is concerned,

24:58.280 --> 25:00.160
without feeling the ego,

25:00.240 --> 25:05.000
without pressurizing the leaders,

25:05.120 --> 25:07.640
try to spend money in a way

25:07.760 --> 25:11.680
that is really useful for Sahaja Yoga.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.160
Then another point is about the family,

25:15.200 --> 25:18.000
as I told you yesterday, that:

25:18.080 --> 25:20.840
''My house, I must have my house, I must, yes''.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.720
Specially leaders' wives.

25:22.840 --> 25:24.120
Again I should warn them, because

25:24.240 --> 25:27.160
all this has created problems to such an extent now,

25:27.280 --> 25:31.760
that we had to throw them out of Sahaja Yoga.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.800
Despite the fact husbands were very good,

25:34.920 --> 25:37.440
but some women wanted to have their own home,

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
they wanted to have their own children,

25:39.680 --> 25:42.040
they wanted to stay in their own.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.080
So this kind of a thing if a leader’s wife has ideas,

25:45.160 --> 25:49.120
then what will happen to others?

25:49.240 --> 25:52.000
They have to follow an example

25:52.120 --> 25:54.160
that is that of a leader,

25:54.240 --> 25:56.040
and if a leader doesn't have that

25:56.160 --> 25:58.040
and the wife doesn't have that example,

25:58.160 --> 26:02.160
the whole thing can be absolutely in a

26:02.240 --> 26:04.080
state of jeopardy,

26:04.160 --> 26:06.040
and that's what I've seen,

26:06.160 --> 26:08.960
that people suffer so much

26:09.080 --> 26:11.040
when they do not realize

26:11.160 --> 26:16.080
that we all are part and parcel of one family.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.160
And we start thinking, imagine,

26:18.240 --> 26:21.120
we cut one finger and plant it somewhere,

26:21.160 --> 26:23.000
what will grow out of it?

26:23.120 --> 26:24.960
Will a tree grow out of it?

26:25.080 --> 26:29.640
or what will grow out of it? Nothing. It will stick.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.920
Till you were not joined with that whole thing

26:33.120 --> 26:36.120
you were all right, whether you were rotting in a place

26:36.200 --> 26:38.200
or wherever you were, doesn't matter,

26:38.280 --> 26:40.240
but when now you have joined,

26:40.280 --> 26:42.800
and when you are part and parcel of the family,

26:42.920 --> 26:46.120
then see how you behave, how your children are.

26:46.240 --> 26:49.040
Are they collective?

26:49.120 --> 26:52.080
Are they sharing or they are fighting?

26:52.160 --> 26:54.080
Try to see that your children can share

26:54.200 --> 26:57.080
their things with others.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.640
And you first of all start doing that,

26:59.760 --> 27:01.880
otherwise children cannot do it.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.960
Now look at Christ,

27:04.080 --> 27:08.040
He lived hardly for four years,

27:08.120 --> 27:11.160
in the sense that He was out of

27:11.280 --> 27:13.200
that country.

27:13.280 --> 27:18.680
Only for four years He could work out the

27:22.280 --> 27:25.120
mission that He had to fulfill.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.560
So He was

27:31.080 --> 27:33.160
only there

27:33.240 --> 27:37.000
to achieve this resurrection at the Agnya chakra.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.120
In that short period,

27:39.240 --> 27:41.800
how many beautiful parables He has given,

27:41.920 --> 27:45.120
how many places He has been, how many people He has talked to.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.200
All His life He has spent like this.

27:48.280 --> 27:52.080
He lived in a very simple manner,

27:52.200 --> 27:55.960
and He had no such tents, or anything,

27:56.080 --> 27:58.160
so He used to go on mountains and Mount,

27:58.240 --> 28:01.200
you know, Sermon on the Mount is very famous,

28:01.280 --> 28:04.160
sermons are, and then He would gather people there

28:04.200 --> 28:06.160
and talk with them.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.120
They would listen to Him.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.960
But nobody imbibed anything that He said.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.160
Very few that He had, about twelve disciples,

28:14.240 --> 28:17.080
who also understood Him when He died,

28:17.160 --> 28:20.120
before that they did not understand what He was.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.000
They could not

28:23.120 --> 28:27.000
visualize actually within their minds,

28:27.080 --> 28:29.120
''What is He doing,

28:29.240 --> 28:31.080
what is He talking?''

28:31.160 --> 28:36.040
But when He was resurrected that made them think:

28:36.160 --> 28:39.160
''Who was He, and what He has done?

28:39.280 --> 28:42.160
How is it we are His disciples?''

28:42.240 --> 28:44.960
And they were ordinary fishermen,

28:45.080 --> 28:47.080
you know that very well,

28:47.160 --> 28:51.960
but their intelligence suddenly manifested,

28:52.080 --> 28:54.120
their dynamism manifested,

28:54.200 --> 28:57.960
and they really showed such good ways

28:58.040 --> 29:01.080
of achieving

29:01.200 --> 29:06.160
what we can call the second birth.

29:06.240 --> 29:12.120
Also, Christianity spread under wrong banner

29:12.200 --> 29:14.160
of Paul and Augustine,

29:14.240 --> 29:17.160
and that's how we see the problems of Christianity.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.080
So much so that we are shocked.

29:20.160 --> 29:24.080
How can Christianity of Christ would be like this?

29:24.120 --> 29:25.160
But it is,

29:25.280 --> 29:28.080
and this Christianity of Christ that has come

29:28.200 --> 29:29.800
has nothing to do with Christ.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.200
And He has said it:

29:31.320 --> 29:35.920
''You’ll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ,' l won't recognize you.''

29:36.040 --> 29:38.960
We are the people who are carrying this.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.960
And also He has said that they’ll be wearing

29:42.080 --> 29:43.160
a mark on their heads

29:43.280 --> 29:46.000
and I will know who are the ones.

29:46.080 --> 29:49.000
So, as it is, you are already marked,

29:49.080 --> 29:53.120
you are already been chosen by Christ

29:53.200 --> 29:55.120
in His Last Judgment,

29:55.200 --> 29:58.080
He has chosen you and you are there,

29:58.160 --> 30:03.040
but still one should know that

30:03.160 --> 30:06.000
there is all the possibility

30:06.080 --> 30:08.160
that we could be hypocrites,

30:08.240 --> 30:11.160
that we are playing with only words,

30:11.280 --> 30:15.160
could be that we still have to cleanse ourselves.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.160
So just put your mind into yourself,

30:18.240 --> 30:20.000
and see for yourself

30:20.120 --> 30:24.000
that: ''Where have I done wrong?''

30:24.120 --> 30:28.960
As far as Mooladhara is concerned,

30:29.080 --> 30:32.120
you people have a special responsibility.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.040
Australians have the greater responsibility

30:36.120 --> 30:38.040
than anybody else,

30:38.120 --> 30:42.000
because this is the place of Shri Ganesha.

30:42.120 --> 30:46.000
And if you do not fully understand

30:46.080 --> 30:49.160
the significance of mooladhara clearing,

30:49.280 --> 30:53.080
I’m sure you won't be able to achieve

30:53.200 --> 30:56.160
any height in Sahaja Yoga.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.160
So all of you should decide about this,

30:59.280 --> 31:03.040
and work it out so that there is no problem

31:03.160 --> 31:06.080
of your ascent, or your rising,

31:06.160 --> 31:10.080
because you're so pure or so beautiful.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.880
All this you have achieved already,

31:13.960 --> 31:16.200
without much difficulty.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.480
Only thing is if those things which are left behind,

31:19.600 --> 31:21.800
suddenly are trying to come up also,

31:21.920 --> 31:25.240
you should not allow it to come into your life,

31:25.240 --> 31:27.240
you should just throw away.

31:27.280 --> 31:29.960
For example like a lotus leaf,

31:30.080 --> 31:33.080
when it is under the water it doesn't show anything,

31:33.200 --> 31:35.160
but when it comes up,

31:35.240 --> 31:37.440
then water doesn't stand on that,

31:37.560 --> 31:39.000
it just falls off.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.080
Doesn't get attached to any water.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.880
You may pour water, any amount - it just takes off.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.920
So this is what you have to find out.

31:48.040 --> 31:51.200
Relationships between each other,

31:51.280 --> 31:54.960
racialism and other things,

31:55.080 --> 31:56.960
we have to just oppose it.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.360
it’s not a good thing to hate anyone

31:59.480 --> 32:03.120
for anything small like that.

32:03.240 --> 32:06.960
The forgiving quality of Christ

32:07.080 --> 32:10.160
at the time when He was crucified has to be remembered.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.040
How He forgave those who crucified Him

32:13.120 --> 32:16.040
because they do not know what they are doing.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.120
But even when they know

32:18.200 --> 32:20.120
what they are doing in Sahaja Yoga,

32:20.240 --> 32:23.080
still people try to crucify.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.080
And this crucifixion can be

32:25.160 --> 32:29.000
all right for the person who is crucified,

32:29.080 --> 32:34.000
but very dangerous for the person who is crucifying.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.960
So this has to be understood,

32:37.080 --> 32:40.160
that to get rid of all these things,

32:40.240 --> 32:43.000
and to get out of all your crucifixions,

32:43.120 --> 32:46.000
you have to have an extremely pure,

32:46.080 --> 32:48.080
ideal, beautiful life.

32:48.160 --> 32:52.000
You should be proud of your virtues.

32:52.120 --> 32:55.040
You should be proud of your greatness.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.160
You should be proud that you are so righteous.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.720
There's nothing to feel bad about.

33:00.840 --> 33:04.120
Otherwise people will boast about their bad things

33:04.200 --> 33:06.160
as in the modern times,

33:06.240 --> 33:07.720
but not about their good things,

33:07.840 --> 33:10.160
regarded as bad manners.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.960
You need not boast of both the things,

33:13.080 --> 33:14.960
but you can be proud

33:15.080 --> 33:19.040
of the things that are so beautiful,

33:19.120 --> 33:22.680
so nice, so energy-giving.

33:24.120 --> 33:28.160
Christ had to surrender to the desire of His Father,

33:28.280 --> 33:31.040
and He asked Him that:

33:31.120 --> 33:34.160
''If You could take away this cup, it would be nice.''

33:34.280 --> 33:36.960
But when the Father said: ''No,

33:37.080 --> 33:39.160
you have to drink this cup,''

33:39.240 --> 33:41.960
He accepted, and He went through it

33:42.080 --> 33:45.080
very bravely, and beautifully.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.160
We have to have the same kind of surrender,

33:48.240 --> 33:51.040
that whatever we have to do,

33:51.160 --> 33:53.200
we should do it with a surrender.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.080
We should not think

33:55.200 --> 33:57.320
that we are achieving something by that,

33:57.440 --> 34:00.120
we are showing off by that, or anything.

34:00.240 --> 34:04.120
Just you should feel that it's being done

34:04.240 --> 34:05.920
because we are surrendering.

34:06.040 --> 34:09.040
We should feel our surrender as a great blessing.

34:09.160 --> 34:11.760
lf you can put your attention to your heart,

34:11.880 --> 34:15.960
and just say that: ''l surrender myself',

34:16.040 --> 34:17.200
that's more than sufficient.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.080
But you shouldn't say that: ''Mother, please

34:19.160 --> 34:21.280
help me to surrender.''

34:21.400 --> 34:24.120
l mean, how can Mother help you?

34:24.240 --> 34:29.160
All these prayers sometimes are

34:29.280 --> 34:33.960
escapes from reality.

34:34.080 --> 34:37.160
''You just help me, help me, this.''

34:37.240 --> 34:42.160
To surrender is very easy.

34:42.280 --> 34:46.000
Just you have to say: ''Mother, come in my heart,

34:46.120 --> 34:48.080
and come in my head,

34:48.160 --> 34:50.120
and come in my attention,''

34:50.200 --> 34:52.080
that's all.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.200
Go on saying like that:

34:53.280 --> 34:55.160
''Please come in my heart,

34:55.240 --> 34:57.080
come in my head,

34:57.160 --> 34:59.240
and come in my attention'',

34:59.360 --> 35:02.120
and as you would go on saying, Kundalini will rise

35:02.240 --> 35:04.960
and She will cleanse you completely.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.040
She's the One who cleanses you.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.160
All the time She's cleansing your chakras.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.040
But problem is we always spoil them.

35:13.120 --> 35:17.080
Again and again, poor thing again and again rises and does that.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.120
So all these problems are

35:20.240 --> 35:24.120
because we are not introspecting.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.560
Also I've seen people are very attach to their wife

35:27.680 --> 35:29.120
or attached to their husbands,

35:29.200 --> 35:32.080
then they cannot see anybody else.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.040
For them, everything is wrong but for themselves,

35:35.160 --> 35:39.720
not their husbands or their wives.

35:40.080 --> 35:43.200
This is, seems to be very common failure.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.120
This kind of false attachment

35:46.200 --> 35:48.120
not only will harm another person,

35:48.240 --> 35:50.640
but will harm your husband or your wife.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.600
Because they will also get away with wrong things.

35:53.720 --> 35:58.160
Once they start getting away with wrong things, there's no end to it,

35:58.240 --> 36:01.720
and they’ll be destroyed.

36:03.200 --> 36:07.000
Now the task before Me is to go to

36:07.120 --> 36:10.120
area of Visshuddhi, in America,

36:10.200 --> 36:14.080
which is another very difficult task.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.160
And unless and until that is put right,

36:17.240 --> 36:19.160
My throat cannot be all right,

36:19.240 --> 36:22.560
so I have to jolly well do it, and I have to work it out.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.600
But as you know, Americans have

36:24.720 --> 36:27.120
something wrong with their upper storey.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.080
l just don't understand.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.120
They like people who take money from them

36:38.200 --> 36:41.960
and who befool them, who have Rolls Royces, all kinds of things,

36:42.080 --> 36:43.520
can you imagine?

36:43.640 --> 36:45.960
They would not have Me on the television,

36:46.080 --> 36:47.800
because I have no Rolls Royce.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.080
l mean, in the television, in the government,

36:50.160 --> 36:53.080
can you imagine such a television where they don't

36:53.240 --> 36:55.160
take you up because you have no Rolls Royces?

36:55.240 --> 36:56.680
it’s not prestigious.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.320
lf I have a Rolls Royce by cheating everyone,

36:59.440 --> 37:03.080
then it's very prestigious, it's a business.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.000
So, with all these things happening,

37:07.120 --> 37:12.040
one feels that the level of spirituality

37:12.160 --> 37:14.080
is really great

37:14.160 --> 37:17.160
in a place like Australia

37:17.200 --> 37:19.160
which is cut off from the world,

37:19.280 --> 37:21.960
which is so much away.

37:22.040 --> 37:26.120
The spirituality is very well expressed here

37:26.200 --> 37:30.040
and I'm sure in Sahaja Yoga they will rise very high,

37:30.120 --> 37:33.120
if they keep to one understanding,

37:33.200 --> 37:37.160
that they are living on the

37:37.240 --> 37:41.160
soil of Shri Ganesha.

37:41.240 --> 37:45.000
How important it is,

37:45.120 --> 37:47.040
how you live,

37:47.120 --> 37:48.960
with what purity

37:49.080 --> 37:51.960
and with what understanding.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.160
So today is the day of Christ's resurrection,

37:55.200 --> 37:58.200
you should say, it's a resurrection for all of us.

37:58.320 --> 38:03.160
He has the One, He is the One who managed it, who did everything for us,

38:03.240 --> 38:06.040
and He's the One who has helped us so much,

38:06.160 --> 38:08.160
otherwise Kundalini well

38:08.200 --> 38:11.080
could never have entered into Sahasrara.

38:11.160 --> 38:14.040
So one has to be really very much thankful to Him

38:14.120 --> 38:15.960
from your heart,

38:16.080 --> 38:20.080
plus you should try to imbibe His qualities.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.000
One other quality is there, of course,

38:23.120 --> 38:26.040
that when people try to criticize your Mother

38:26.120 --> 38:28.160
or try to insult your Mother,

38:28.240 --> 38:31.080
you get angry, that is just like Christ,

38:31.200 --> 38:34.000
He could not tolerate any insult,

38:34.080 --> 38:37.200
or any kind of a neglect of His Mother.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.320
He Himself has said that this will not be tolerated.

38:41.440 --> 38:44.080
In the same way you people also,

38:44.160 --> 38:48.040
if you have only for that, I am with you.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.960
I’m absolutely with you,

38:50.080 --> 38:52.160
that you do not have

38:52.240 --> 38:59.800
any more the feeling

39:04.280 --> 39:07.960
of guilt, or anything within yourself.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.040
When you understand

39:10.160 --> 39:12.080
that whatever you are doing,

39:12.160 --> 39:15.160
you are doing with complete sincerity,

39:15.240 --> 39:17.160
with complete understanding.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.960
Even if you make mistakes, it doesn't matter.

39:20.080 --> 39:23.200
The mistake will bring forth something lack,

39:23.280 --> 39:26.040
but you have to be extremely sincere,

39:26.160 --> 39:28.000
this feeling should be within you.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.080
Look at the feeling of Christ.

39:30.160 --> 39:34.200
l mean, He crucified Himself.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.200
He asked for the trouble.

39:36.280 --> 39:39.400
He went all the way there, there was no need for Him to go,

39:39.560 --> 39:41.960
enter into that area,

39:42.120 --> 39:45.120
and He got this.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.160
Of course,

39:46.280 --> 39:49.000
you are not going to be crucified

39:49.120 --> 39:51.120
now for your resurrection, not at all,

39:51.200 --> 39:53.160
but

39:53.280 --> 39:55.000
in a way

39:55.080 --> 39:57.600
you have to crucify whatever is ugly,

39:57.720 --> 39:59.160
whatever is wrong,

39:59.280 --> 40:01.520
whatever is detrimental to your growth.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.640
You have to become really very beautiful people,

40:04.760 --> 40:06.200
very beautiful.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.040
Anybody who talks to you,

40:08.160 --> 40:10.120
anybody who sees you should say that:

40:10.240 --> 40:14.080
''I met such and such person, very beautiful,

40:14.160 --> 40:17.480
and then I asked, 'How is it you're so beautiful?'

40:17.600 --> 40:21.080
and the person said that 'I’m a Sahaja Yogini'''.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.680
it’s a very, very common

40:26.080 --> 40:27.160
experience of Mine,

40:27.240 --> 40:29.080
very common experience.

40:29.160 --> 40:33.800
And the main thing is

40:35.240 --> 40:38.160
that you have to respect

40:38.240 --> 40:40.120
your self-realization,

40:40.160 --> 40:42.160
your resurrection has to be respected.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.120
lf you do not respect your resurrection,

40:45.240 --> 40:50.080
you are not going to help yourself or others.

40:50.160 --> 40:55.000
l met once by chance,

40:55.080 --> 41:01.200
the High Court Judge of Hague High Court,

41:01.280 --> 41:04.040
which is a World High Court.

41:04.160 --> 41:07.120
Just in Romania.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.200
He was sitting there.

41:09.280 --> 41:12.000
l was also sitting, and he was looking at Me.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.080
Trying to locate him, I couldn't locate him.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.080
And then we went to Paris,

41:18.160 --> 41:19.400
and he was also in Paris.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.880
Frankfurt, he was changing, and I was also changing there.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.200
So he just came and asked: ''By the way, have I met You before?''

41:27.280 --> 41:29.080
l said: ''Maybe.''

41:29.160 --> 41:31.160
l knew who he was but I kept quiet.

41:31.240 --> 41:35.400
He said: ''You know I'm such and such, and I went to India

41:35.520 --> 41:39.680
and there was a lady who cured me, are You the one?''

41:39.800 --> 41:42.160
l said: ''Yes, I am such and such''.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.520
All right.

41:43.640 --> 41:48.640
Then what he told Me was most encouraging, was this.

41:48.760 --> 41:52.120
He said: ''That time You cured me I felt gratified,

41:52.160 --> 41:54.920
l thought You were one of the healers and all that.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.560
But when I saw the life of Dr Nagen,

41:57.680 --> 42:00.480
this is my colleague, the way he's transformed,

42:00.600 --> 42:03.000
the way he had become such a good man,

42:03.120 --> 42:06.160
such a wonderful person, I asked him once:

42:06.240 --> 42:09.160
'What, what has made you so good,

42:09.240 --> 42:12.240
how can you be such a good man in these bad times,

42:12.280 --> 42:15.960
when from every side there's such an attack?'''

42:16.040 --> 42:19.560
And also he took a very big stand.

42:27.280 --> 42:30.000
'''And what, what was the thing?

42:30.120 --> 42:35.080
What made you such a good person?

42:35.160 --> 42:38.000
You are living in a place like this,

42:38.080 --> 42:44.560
and you know how Hague is surrounded by all kinds of criminals

42:44.680 --> 42:46.160
and drugs and all that.

42:46.240 --> 42:51.000
And you are such a nice, and a beautiful saintly person.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.440
What has made you?'''

42:52.560 --> 42:56.160
''So then he told me, 'You remember the lady who cured you,

42:56.280 --> 42:58.120
She has changed me completely.

42:58.200 --> 43:01.960
It is because of Her I have become a Yogi,

43:02.040 --> 43:04.080
and that's why my life has changed,

43:04.080 --> 43:05.960
because it gives you the strength.'''

43:06.080 --> 43:09.200
So this man told Me, I was really very much touched.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.640
So he said: ''Now can I have Your photograph?''

43:11.760 --> 43:13.440
l said: ''l don't have any photograph.''

43:13.560 --> 43:16.520
There were three, four Sahaja Yogis with Me, they were wearing the badges,

43:16.640 --> 43:18.200
but only there was one badge.

43:18.320 --> 43:21.920
But the Secretary of the Hague High Court

43:22.040 --> 43:23.360
was also with him.

43:23.480 --> 43:26.280
He got so much interested, so he said:

43:26.400 --> 43:27.880
''Can I have the badge?''

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
So we gave it to this judge, so the other fellow says:

43:31.080 --> 43:33.040
''What about me? l would also like to have a badge.''

43:33.160 --> 43:35.400
l said: ''Are you going to carry this badge?''

43:35.520 --> 43:38.400
''Yes, yes, of course.'' immediately he wore it.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.720
Suddenly Mathias found another badge,

43:40.840 --> 43:42.680
but they had gone to the airplane.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.080
Then he ran there and he told the air hostess:

43:45.200 --> 43:46.400
''Give it to the gentleman.''

43:46.520 --> 43:48.440
''Ah, I saw one with this badge. All right,

43:48.560 --> 43:51.400
I’ll give it to the other.'' And she took it inside.

43:51.520 --> 43:55.120
Can you imagine these people of such high society,

43:55.240 --> 43:57.160
l should say, so highly placed in life,

43:57.240 --> 43:59.080
such intellectuals,

43:59.160 --> 44:02.080
they are the judges of the Supreme High Court,

44:02.200 --> 44:05.120
in the sense that it's the super, most

44:05.240 --> 44:08.080
High Court in Hague, World High Court,

44:08.160 --> 44:10.960
and so humbled down, because

44:11.080 --> 44:13.760
of one person whom they saw so changed.

44:13.880 --> 44:17.200
So you can imagine how you can change your colleagues,

44:17.320 --> 44:20.200
how you can show better results

44:20.280 --> 44:24.080
by your proper dignified behavior.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.160
it’s going to work out very well if you have that example.

44:28.240 --> 44:31.160
And Christ, why He impressed people so much?

44:31.240 --> 44:33.240
Because of His personal life.

44:33.360 --> 44:35.200
In His personal life He showed

44:35.280 --> 44:37.160
how powerful He was,

44:37.240 --> 44:39.120
and then, and His death, He showed

44:39.240 --> 44:43.000
by His resurrection that He was something

44:43.120 --> 44:46.000
beyond human comprehension,

44:46.080 --> 44:50.160
where He has just become

44:50.240 --> 44:53.080
resurrected after death.

44:53.200 --> 44:57.160
Must be that He was absolutely purity personified,

44:57.280 --> 44:59.080
which He was.

44:59.200 --> 45:03.800
So today we have to place ourselves

45:04.160 --> 45:06.000
in such a manner

45:06.120 --> 45:10.960
that we ask for purity, and purity, and purity,

45:11.040 --> 45:12.960
and that we are going to work out

45:13.080 --> 45:16.080
this purity within ourselves with full sincerity.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.160
We are not going to get into ego trip,

45:18.240 --> 45:21.080
and think that we are perfectly all right. No,

45:21.160 --> 45:23.040
we are just going to ask

45:23.160 --> 45:26.960
for complete purity within ourselves.

45:27.080 --> 45:30.520
This is what the great, what Christ has given us,

45:30.640 --> 45:32.160
which we should achieve,

45:32.240 --> 45:34.960
and we should really show

45:35.040 --> 45:37.960
that we can achieve that purity within ourselves.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.120
Whatever has happened you forget it,

45:40.240 --> 45:42.000
you don't worry on that point,

45:42.120 --> 45:44.520
whatever has happened is a gone case,

45:44.640 --> 45:46.240
but whatever has to happen is this,

45:46.400 --> 45:49.640
that you all should ask for purity,

45:49.760 --> 45:51.240
all criticism, all hatred

45:51.280 --> 45:53.160
and all those things will disappear,

45:53.240 --> 45:56.000
plus the purity will give you

45:56.080 --> 45:57.960
that unique position

45:58.080 --> 46:00.080
that when people will even see your life,

46:00.160 --> 46:01.200
they will change.

46:01.280 --> 46:04.720
Only by seeing your life, they will change.

46:05.080 --> 46:08.680
l hope this works out very well here,

46:11.240 --> 46:14.160
and maybe by the time I come next time,

46:14.280 --> 46:16.680
we’ll have lots, lots of Sahaja Yogis,

46:16.800 --> 46:19.000
beautifully connected to each other,

46:19.120 --> 46:22.120
beautifully having relations with each other,

46:22.240 --> 46:25.000
and these children growing up

46:25.080 --> 46:27.040
very fast as well.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.080
l hope to come back here

46:29.160 --> 46:31.080
again to the land of Shri Ganesha

46:31.200 --> 46:34.080
where Purity has taken over.

46:34.200 --> 46:38.720
May God Bless You.

46:44.280 --> 46:48.040
Easter Puja is a simple Puja in a way,

46:48.160 --> 46:52.640
because we just...

46:59.200 --> 47:03.080
of course the Footwashing has to be there by children,

47:03.200 --> 47:06.040
because that's the special day today,

47:06.160 --> 47:09.120
but otherwise it's a much simpler Puja,

47:09.240 --> 47:13.080
and it doesn't take all those things that

47:13.160 --> 47:16.160
we normally do.
