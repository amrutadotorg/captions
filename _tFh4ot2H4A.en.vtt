A Sinless Life
January 1, 1988 Ganapatipule, India

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:19.624
Happy New Year to you all!

00:05:23.253 --> 00:05:31.290
May God bless you this year with all His divine powers.

00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:40.344
May all the choicest flowers of joy

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.801
and happiness be showered upon you.

00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:56.622
May God give you wisdom to become great Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:57.706 --> 00:06:05.614
so that a new world can be created beautifully out of you.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.327
Very happy to meet you all today here.

00:06:15.385 --> 00:06:21.333
First day, I am sure there must have been lots of inconveniences.

00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:26.047
But Sahaja Yogis don’t feel any inconvenience.

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:45.536
It’s important that you all are here,

00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:50.012
should meet each other, talk to each other about Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:50.592 --> 00:06:57.592
Try to understand what’s going on in the other parts of the world.

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:08.693
There are certain problems which arise sometimes when you don’t listen to Me.

00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:16.622
So whatever I have said about swimming, the timings, please keep to it.

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:21.083
We have to give up our old conditionings,

00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:25.265
I mean, we have to start a new life of understanding and wisdom.

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:31.682
Today is a day when we should decide,

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:38.542
take some vows in our hearts, what we want to do for our future,

00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:44.249
for Sahaja Yoga, for building of our lives.

00:07:45.504 --> 00:07:48.015
You know all the programs we have.

00:07:48.547 --> 00:07:54.198
Tomorrow we’ll be giving you the final list of the people who are getting married.

00:07:55.998 --> 00:08:02.998
And, also you should meet people whom you are getting married to.

00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:07.977
Talk to them and find out about them.

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:16.311
Today I don’t want to say much. They say whatever you do on the first,

00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:20.231
it happens to you all the year round,

00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:23.596
and I don’t want to speak like this all the time.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.793
Because I’ve been speaking too much.

00:08:27.022 --> 00:08:31.968
So best way to enjoy New Year is to decide

00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:37.118
as to what we are going to do now, further.

00:08:39.001 --> 00:08:41.540
What are we going to achieve next year

00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:46.791
so that we can look back and say that in one year we have done this job.

00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:55.448
So forget the past, and think of today

00:08:55.843 --> 00:08:59.342
which is an important date, we are here.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.837
That we have to decide about ourselves.

00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:11.149
Let us decide that we’ll have sinless life.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.332
We’ll have a sinless life and complete obedience to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.838
Forget the past. Past conditionings.
