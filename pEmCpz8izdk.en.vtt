WEBVTT

22:46.693 --> 22:56.874
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

22:56.874 --> 23:05.783
At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is.

23:05.983 --> 23:18.863
We cannot change, it we cannot transform it, unfortunately we cannot also know it at human awareness.

23:19.964 --> 23:26.771
Whatever they have told you about this mechanism within us

23:27.772 --> 23:33.144
and whatever I am going to tell you about yourself

23:34.812 --> 23:40.118
you have to treat it like a hypothesis

23:40.318 --> 23:44.589
and you have to keep your mind open like a scientist.

23:44.589 --> 23:53.164
If it is proved, then as honest people,  I hope, you will recognise it.

23:59.570 --> 24:06.644
This instrument definitely lies within us. We are not aware of it.

24:06.644 --> 24:15.653
Of course, in the medical science they have talked about the plexuses at different levels of our spinal cord.

24:16.654 --> 24:24.595
And also, in the brain, they have talked about the crossing of the optic chiasma.

24:25.730 --> 24:33.137
Above that is the limbic area which we call as the one thousand petaled lotus.

24:34.472 --> 24:42.780
In the Bible, it is described that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

24:42.780 --> 24:48.753
These tongues of flames are like petals, beautifully coloured

24:48.753 --> 25:03.301
as you see here, there are different colours to every set and they are extremely soothing to look at.

25:03.301 --> 25:11.642
They look like flames but they don’t burn. They soothe you.

25:12.643 --> 25:25.456
As it is now, we have to understand that there is a fundamental truth about yourself

25:26.457 --> 25:39.904
and that is you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, this intelligence, emotions,

25:40.905 --> 25:44.909
but you are the Spirit.

25:44.909 --> 25:52.483
So, you have to rise to the level of selfhood as every scripture has said

25:53.818 --> 26:01.959
that you have to be born again. In Sanskrit language a Realised soul is called as "dvijaha",

26:02.527 --> 26:11.569
meaning twice born. And also, a bird is called as "dvija". Again, meaning the twice born.

26:12.036 --> 26:22.937
So, first a bird is born as an egg, a closed personality, and when it develops and matures

26:22.937 --> 26:28.617
then a bird is born out of the same egg.

26:28.719 --> 26:40.958
The same idea they have used about human beings, that first we are human beings where these two Institutions as you see are covered.

26:40.965 --> 26:51.408
But after Realisation, when the residual power of Kundalini rises and pierces through your

26:51.408 --> 27:00.450
optic chiasma which is called as Agnya Chakra then these two Institutions are sucked in

27:00.450 --> 27:08.400
and ultimately it passes through your fontanelle bone area.

27:08.400 --> 27:26.944
The second truth is that this whole cosmos is completely covered with the divine love,

27:26.944 --> 27:33.851
the Power of God’s love.

27:33.851 --> 27:43.768
We do not know about it. We are not aware of it though we have heard about it. Every scripture has described it.

27:43.794 --> 27:54.638
This All-pervading Power of God’s love is the one we have never felt, but you can see

27:54.638 --> 28:02.113
the living work, see the beautiful flowers we have here and the beautifully leaves to match them.

28:02.113 --> 28:10.958
How they have come from Mother Earth? We take everything for granted. Such beautiful things are done by nature.

28:10.988 --> 28:19.759
Even ourselves! See our heart pulsates, pulsates without we doing anything about it.

28:19.759 --> 28:28.688
Look at our eyes, they are beautiful cameras and the brain is a beautiful computer. Who has made this?

28:28.688 --> 28:37.114
Then we have evolved from amoeba to human stage. Who has done that?

28:37.114 --> 28:45.423
We do not even think. We take it for granted whatever has come to us from this All-pervading divine Power

28:45.423 --> 28:51.683
which does all the living work.

28:51.683 --> 28:59.604
This Power is the one which has evolved us to the human level.

28:59.604 --> 29:10.139
And the reflection of the same power is this Kundalini within us which has to rise like a premule in a seed.

29:10.139 --> 29:19.620
It has to sprout. And once it is done you get connected to this All-pervading Power.

29:19.620 --> 29:27.511
Like this instrument is here and unless and until it is connected to the mains it has no meaning.

29:27.511 --> 29:35.341
In a same way we have no meaning. Our life has no meaning till we are connected to the mains.

29:35.341 --> 29:42.222
That is the reason that all the problems like ecological problems,

29:42.222 --> 29:51.860
political problems, economic problems, family problems, problems, problems, problems, I mean all human problems are created by human beings.

29:51.860 --> 29:59.509
So, we have missed out somewhere and we haven’t got the absolute truth with us, that’s why we are quarrelling.

29:59.509 --> 30:03.181
If you knew the absolute truth there’s no question of quarrelling.

30:03.181 --> 30:09.881
So, we have missed out somewhere. Even in Science when we start developing something,

30:09.881 --> 30:12.288
we have seen that it boomerangs.

30:12.288 --> 30:23.056
Like we have got atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb, oxygen bomb is created like devil sitting on our heads anytime

30:23.056 --> 30:26.095
we all could be finished.

30:26.095 --> 30:33.017
In any walk of life when we use our mental processes it is in a linear way.

30:33.017 --> 30:37.457
After sometime it loses its power and boomerangs

30:37.457 --> 30:49.380
and that’s how you find in every, every enterprise we take up, there is some after effect of that.

30:49.380 --> 30:52.239
So, we do not know how far to go.

30:52.239 --> 30:57.869
But the nature knows. The nature knows how far the tree is going to grow.

30:57.869 --> 31:03.534
how far a bush is going to grow and how far the grass is going to grow.

31:03.534 --> 31:07.568
But we don’t know and we have got the freedom

31:07.568 --> 31:10.566
to choose whichever way we want to go.

31:10.566 --> 31:15.489
If you want to go to hell we can go.  If you want to go to heaven we can.

31:15.489 --> 31:21.134
So now, it is wise for us to think that where have we missed?

31:21.134 --> 31:29.075
People I know who are very deft in scriptures whether it is Christian or it is Islamic,

31:29.075 --> 31:32.007
or it is Hindu, any scripture,

31:32.007 --> 31:38.081
anyone who belongs to all these different religions can commit any crime.

31:38.081 --> 31:42.356
There is no control, there is no understanding.

31:42.356 --> 31:49.358
Just recently you have heard about the one thousand people at least were killed,

31:49.358 --> 31:55.393
these Azerbaijans, by Christians, can you imagine Christians doing that?

31:55.393 --> 31:58.930
In the same way the Muslims have done it.

31:58.930 --> 32:06.354
Even the Hindus those who believe that there is a Spirit in every person, then how can they have caste system?

32:06.354 --> 32:12.512
How can they look down upon some people who belong to lower caste and higher caste?

32:12.512 --> 32:16.003
So, they all have missed some point.

32:16.003 --> 32:21.257
Mostly they have become either power oriented or money oriented.

32:21.257 --> 32:24.025
None of them seem to be Spirit oriented

32:24.025 --> 32:32.630
and so the whole effort is in a wrong direction and that’s how I think we have missed the point

32:32.630 --> 32:35.997
where we had to go through the

32:35.997 --> 32:38.720
absorption of these religions.

32:38.720 --> 32:43.829
We have not been able to absorb. It has not become an innate experience with us.

32:43.829 --> 32:50.958
It has to be a very innate experience within our being which is not, which is outside.

32:50.958 --> 32:59.301
Today we are reading some book, some scripture and tomorrow we can go and do anything which is sinful,

32:59.301 --> 33:02.115
which is wrong which is destructive.

33:02.115 --> 33:05.200
So, what is the matter? Why it has happened?

33:05.200 --> 33:12.443
Because the power of absorption can only come when you become the Spirit.

33:12.443 --> 33:21.493
Spirit is the light; when it enters into your attention, then you absorb religion

33:21.493 --> 33:27.063
which is innate, within you, because religion is not outside,

33:27.063 --> 33:34.622
it is within as Christ has said,that, "The kingdom of God is within yourself".

33:34.622 --> 33:44.713
Now this religion within us which is enlightened by the Spirit is like our valency.

33:44.713 --> 33:48.895
Carbon has four valencies while human beings have ten valencies.

33:48.895 --> 33:57.505
And when these ten valencies are enlightened within us, then we don’t have to worry about creating some sin

33:57.505 --> 34:02.202
or getting some sort of a punishment for something.

34:02.202 --> 34:10.841
We automatically become, automatically, spontaneously, become righteous.

34:10.841 --> 34:17.193
And the righteousness starts manifesting itself. But apart from that

34:17.193 --> 34:23.237
the attention which is being enlightened by the Spirit becomes extremely dynamic.

34:23.237 --> 34:30.901
Now see your seen this Australians singing Indian songs and Sanskrit songs and Marathi.

34:30.901 --> 34:38.612
I must say Marathi is one of the most difficult languages to think of, but worse is Sanskrit, you see.

34:38.612 --> 34:46.909
From childhood Indians are not allowed to eat betel nut because they think they can’t pronounce these tongue twisters, you see.

34:46.909 --> 34:54.907
Imagine these Australians singing so beautifully that from outside nobody can know who is singing.

34:54.907 --> 35:05.009
It looks like some Indians are singing this song and the same vice versa. Indians sing also English songs very well.

35:05.009 --> 35:07.292
How they have learnt?

35:07.292 --> 35:16.026
English were ruling us for 300 years. They couldn’t pronounce one sentence in ordinary Hindi language.

35:16.026 --> 35:24.586
We had to work out with them some sort of thing like, they wanted to know: "Please close the door".

35:24.586 --> 35:33.097
So, how to say? They can’t say that in Hindi language. So, we used to all right say, "There was a cold day".

35:33.097 --> 35:39.316
Then they would say "There was a cold day" meaning, say that ‘darwaza khole dey’ in Hindi.

35:39.587 --> 35:48.114
It was such a terrible situation to teach them even one sentence of English, while how these children are playing so well.

35:48.114 --> 35:56.069
They become so dynamic. There are many artists in India who came to Sahaja Yoga and have become world famous.

35:56.069 --> 36:03.996
Otherwise also, even in Australia we have some painters and artists who have become very famous after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

36:03.996 --> 36:13.238
Because the attention becomes very concentrated and deep into any subject you enter it, you get the deftness of it.

36:13.238 --> 36:23.011
You become the master of it. Any subject you want to do it and that’s how we have people who have done very well even materially in Sahaja Yoga.

36:23.011 --> 36:31.092
But at the same time, Spirit is the witness, witness of the whole play.

36:31.092 --> 36:39.549
But when it comes into the attention, we also become the witness. We see everything as a drama, as a play.

36:39.549 --> 36:44.910
Today while coming to your city we lost our way three times.

36:44.910 --> 36:50.256
And they were saying, "I don’t know when we are going to reach".

36:50.256 --> 36:57.397
I said, "Don’t worry.  We are supposed to go there, accept it. We are supposed to go to all these places that is why we went there.

36:57.397 --> 37:04.364
And we'll be there in time, you shouldn’t worry about that". So, it is a kind of a witness.

37:04.364 --> 37:15.764
Really, we saw some beautiful things because we were lost, which normally we would never have seen.

37:15.764 --> 37:25.526
When you become the witness, to you the whole thing is just a play and you are not involved into it.

37:25.843 --> 37:34.618
The state that is achieved through Self-realisation is first as we call it, is thoughtless awareness.

37:34.618 --> 37:39.385
The other day many people asked us, "Mother we go on thinking, how are we going to meditate?"

37:39.385 --> 37:43.469
I said, "You are not to meditate. You are in meditation".

37:43.469 --> 37:44.465
"How?"

37:44.465 --> 37:55.807
"Because when this Kundalini passes through the centre of Agnya then its sucks in the thought process".

37:55.807 --> 38:03.567
For example, the thoughts are coming either from the future or from the past.

38:03.567 --> 38:13.439
If I say, "Now you stand in your present", you cannot. We do not know the present. Either it is the future we are thinking about or we are thinking about the past.

38:13.439 --> 38:19.003
And we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts all the time from one to another.

38:19.003 --> 38:25.930
Some people really go mad and in Switzerland, one doctor told me, "You cut my throat or do what you like but stop my thinking".

38:25.930 --> 38:31.810
So, sometimes this bombardment is too much. But when this Kundalini rises,

38:31.810 --> 38:39.174
what she does, these thoughts which rise and fall and rise and fall, there is a space in between

38:39.174 --> 38:48.381
and she stops us at that space, which is the present and is the silence.  It's the silence within us.

38:48.381 --> 38:54.085
Gradually it starts increasing and we develop that state of thoughtless awareness.

38:54.085 --> 39:10.525
When our spirituality starts growing higher than that state when the kundalini processes through your fontanelle bone area and your connection is well established.

39:10.525 --> 39:16.854
Because the Kundalini comes down, if you are sick, you have liver problem it comes down, cures you, again goes up.

39:16.854 --> 39:25.578
Then you have a problem, it goes up and down, up and down like a yo-yo and then ultimately it has to fix it itself.

39:25.578 --> 39:33.918
Once it is fixed, then you reach a state which we call as doubtless awareness, "nirvikalpa samadhi".

39:33.918 --> 39:39.008
At that state, you develop all the powers of a Realised soul.

39:39.008 --> 39:50.420
To say that, "I am twice born, I am born again" is just another brand to put on your head, whether you put the brand of a Christian, Hindu, Muslim is just a brand.

39:50.420 --> 40:01.416
It has nothing to do with it and for that to make it reality, once you are a Realised soul

40:01.416 --> 40:09.886
automatically you understand that you are ‘that’.

40:09.886 --> 40:21.848
There is not doubt about it.  You are a Christian, you are a Muslim, you are a Hindu at the same time.

40:21.848 --> 40:26.838
Because all the essences of these religions are the same.

40:26.838 --> 40:31.054
We fight because we don’t know the absolute problem.

40:31.054 --> 40:43.855
How can all these religions be born in an absurd way that "this fights that and that fights that"?

40:43.855 --> 40:52.007
How can it be? If it is one God, if it is Divinity, how can it? Logically it cannot.

40:52.007 --> 40:58.467
So, these are all the flowers, these incarnations and prophets, who started religions.

40:58.467 --> 41:08.351
And religions are all the flowers on the tree of life at different times of course, and they had to do different types of work.

41:08.351 --> 41:16.641
But they are born on the same tree while we have plucked the flowers fighting, "This is mine, this is mine". They are dead flowers!

41:16.641 --> 41:21.553
We are fighting with the dead flowers and that’s why we have fundamentalism.

41:21.553 --> 41:26.154
This is the biggest problem now. The world has to face is fundamentalism.

41:26.154 --> 41:41.625
Some are very sophisticated fundamentalists and some are very open exposed fundamentalists but they are fundamentalists, because they cannot see the good points of another religion.

41:41.625 --> 41:48.381
They think they are the best but they are not! You can see in their lives they are just like anybody else.

41:48.381 --> 41:55.789
And when people cling on to some dogmas or some sort of a clan like that, it's an impossible situation

41:55.789 --> 42:01.400
because they are so much mesmerized with the idea that they do not think of their benevolence.

42:01.400 --> 42:13.031
I just asked, "My child, your father did the same, his father did the same.  You are doing the same.  Now what is the gain, what did you achieve?"

42:13.031 --> 42:19.681
As a result of Self-realization, it's not a brand but you get the powers.

42:19.681 --> 42:26.123
First power you get that you can feel this All-pervading Power on your fingertips.

42:26.123 --> 42:30.170
Then on your hands it starts.

42:30.170 --> 42:43.774
This moment has a sort of a computer quality that you can find out what’s wrong with you, with your centres.

42:43.774 --> 42:50.600
As shown here, you will see which is 1, these are 5, 6, and 7 centres on the left.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.075
In the same way on the right hand.

42:54.075 --> 43:05.789
These centres relate to the power of a desire, we can say, to the left side to our subconscious and collective subconscious, to our past.

43:05.789 --> 43:17.903
And these centres relate to our physical and to our mental being, to our future and to the futuristic ideas.

43:17.903 --> 43:22.830
So, we can feel it on our fingertips.

43:22.830 --> 43:27.912
As you say, you should have knowledge on your fingertips. So, you really get the knowledge on your fingertips.

43:27.912 --> 43:34.425
And you start feeling what’s wrong with you, also, you can feel what’s wrong with anyone.

43:34.425 --> 43:40.494
Because you develop a new consciousness, a new power of collective consciousness.

43:40.494 --> 43:50.030
Who is the other? When a drop becomes the ocean, when the microcosm becomes the macrocosm, then who is the other?

43:50.030 --> 43:53.386
You can feel another person on your fingertips.

43:53.386 --> 44:05.012
Only thing you have to know how to improve, to correct and heal these centres

44:05.012 --> 44:09.633
which are in jeopardy, who are in trouble.

44:09.633 --> 44:20.958
So, we, start talking in the language of centres. We don’t say, "Something wrong with you, you are egoistic". No. We say, "Your Agnya is catching".

44:20.958 --> 44:30.074
And a person who is suffering himself will come and say. He will not feel shy. He will say, “Mother my Agnya is catching means I am very egoistical”.

44:30.074 --> 44:34.880
Nobody will say like that to anyone, never confess. But It gives you a headache.

44:34.880 --> 44:41.531
So, he says, "All right, better correct it.  Mother I have got a headache with this Agnya".

44:41.531 --> 44:48.844
It becomes an innate feeling and innate religion within yourself.

44:48.844 --> 44:59.127
So, nobody has to tell you because in the light of the Spirit, the Spirit becomes your master. So, you become your own master. It can guide you.

44:59.127 --> 45:07.241
It shows you the way and you don’t know, you go to the Eternity. How far you will grow into it? One can’t say.

45:07.241 --> 45:14.627
But I’ve seen people. Now, as they have told me, we are working in 62 countries. I haven’t visited all of them.

45:14.627 --> 45:25.862
And also, I know of at least 52 countries who always come to India.  We have a seminar of these people who come down.

45:25.862 --> 45:31.843
It is very surprising, such beautiful angelic people they are!

45:31.843 --> 45:34.300
There is no question of quarrel, fights.

45:34.300 --> 45:41.199
There is no question of lust. Somebody’s wife running with somebody, somebody’s husband running with somebody, flirting with someone.

45:41.199 --> 45:44.906
Nothing of the kind. Very pure relationships.

45:44.906 --> 45:49.804
As they say "khalis", "there's a Khalistan" you see, but the word came from Nanaka.

45:49.804 --> 45:54.758
He said, "You have to be khalis", means pure. Such purified lives they have!

45:54.758 --> 46:05.618
And such love, such brotherhood, such sisterhood, beautiful understanding and they are so powerful

46:05.618 --> 46:14.172
that they can raise the Kundalini of people, that they can cure people and they are so knowledgeable.

46:14.172 --> 46:20.958
Such a society has been already formed. Such a unique race has been already there.

46:20.958 --> 46:29.250
Now we have to see how many more would like to join, to enjoy themselves the Spirit that is within themselves.

46:29.250 --> 46:38.503
In this little lecture, I don’t think I’ll be able to tell you all about it. Only thing I have to tell you, as in this hall there are many lights

46:38.503 --> 46:48.368
and if you have to put the lights on, you just have to tell somebody that, "All right, this is the switch. Put on and it’s all done". Because it is built in.

46:48.368 --> 46:55.858
All this is built in within you. I don’t have to do anything.  It’s your own power which will be awakened.

46:55.858 --> 47:03.390
Of course, you can’t pay for it. It is a living process like the Mother Earth.  She sprouts these flowers. How much do we pay her?

47:03.390 --> 47:09.800
We don’t pay her anything. She doesn’t understand money, she doesn’t understand banking. She doesn’t understand even recession.

47:09.800 --> 47:21.848
That is our headache. That Mother Earth is innocent. That’s her job is just to sprout these flowers.

47:21.848 --> 47:30.012
in the same way that kundalini gets sprouted. There is no obligation, you cannot pay for it.

47:30.012 --> 47:36.478
For awakening you cannot pay, for the knowledge you cannot pay, you cannot pay for anything. Of course, you have to pay for this hall

47:36.478 --> 47:43.533
for which I’m sure some Sahaja Yogis have paid or we have a Trustee that must have paid for this hall.

47:43.533 --> 47:49.659
But you cannot pay for a Spiritual life. One has to understand this very clearly.

47:49.659 --> 48:00.444
But I don’t know how everybody has become so money oriented that it has penetrated into also our religious groups and religious movements.  It cannot be.

48:00.444 --> 48:15.048
It’s absolutely wrong. Anybody who says that he pays, you have to pay for a certain kind of emancipation or some kind of an awareness, like TM and all those nonsensical things, beware them.

48:15.048 --> 48:18.200
It is absolutely nonsensical.

48:18.200 --> 48:26.079
I must warn you that all kinds of thugs have come out of India and are absolutely leeching them.

48:26.079 --> 48:33.160
It is such a serious thing. They have not only taken money. After all, there are so many thuggeries going on doesn’t matter.

48:33.160 --> 48:40.353
Once upon a time the English came and looted us so they are going on looting English, but that’s a different thing.

48:40.353 --> 48:45.623
There are looters all over the world.  But these are not only that, they spoil your kundalini.

48:45.623 --> 48:57.319
They spoil your basic fundamental thing and that’s why you have to be very careful that first of all you should find out that what are the disciples like.

48:57.319 --> 49:03.221
How are they? How do they talk? How do they live? What is their style is?

49:03.221 --> 49:14.960
And then once it has happened that you have seen that it is perfectly all right, they are wonderful people, they have something special, then you should go to any such group.

49:14.960 --> 49:20.994
Instead of just like a fashion, there is something,  advertisement come, so we are running after that.

49:20.994 --> 49:27.918
Because they make money so they can advertise better. They have ways and methods. They have great advertising departmentq.

49:27.918 --> 49:31.161
But these are advertising departments to Hell.

49:31.161 --> 49:38.953
One has to be very careful because you are seekers of truth and these are born in this modern times.

49:38.953 --> 49:51.861
As William Blake has rightly said that, "Men of God will be born and they will become godly and make others saintly". This is what is Sahaja Yoga in short.

49:51.861 --> 49:56.453
I am sorry I wouldn’t be able to tell you in details about it.

49:56.453 --> 50:02.523
but you have to be collective and I am very happy to know that we have got a nice centre here

50:02.523 --> 50:09.455
and you can learn a lot whatever you want to know how to fix your connection with the divine Power.

50:09.455 --> 50:14.737
This is Yoga. "Yoga" means the connection with divine power.

50:14.737 --> 50:25.583
As it is, I would like you to ask me some questions but the question should not be aggressive. I have not come here to take away anything from you.

50:25.583 --> 50:31.327
I have come here to give you what is your own.

50:31.327 --> 50:37.259
So, it should be a relevant question and should not be a big lecture to people.

50:37.259 --> 50:45.686
Sometimes I find somebody is coming from some fundamentalist thing and starts giving a big lecture, bigger than mine, and people want to run away.

50:45.686 --> 50:48.028
And I have to show all the patience.

50:48.028 --> 50:52.784
So, please be wise and ask sensible questions.

50:52.785 --> 51:01.710
One thing I must say, that 22 years I have been facing people of different types of different cultures, and different natures.

51:01.710 --> 51:06.220
What I find that I can answer all the questions very well.

51:06.220 --> 51:14.135
No because it is the training now, I’ve learnt but answering the question also is a mental feat.

51:14.135 --> 51:18.422
That doesn’t guarantee the awakening of the kundalini.

51:18.422 --> 51:25.584
It’s something very different because it is beyond your mind.  You have to go beyond your mind.

51:25.584 --> 51:31.038
It is not the work of the mind that you can do through your mind but is beyond your mind.

51:31.038 --> 51:39.351
So, even if I answer you, there is no guarantee that that will be all right for your Kundalini awakening.

51:39.351 --> 51:44.695
It really, of course, work out, I am sure, that it is going to work out for all of you.

51:44.695 --> 51:57.303
So, if you have any sensible questions I would definitely like to answer them because when the kundalini will be rising I don't want your mind to come out and say that, "Come along, we did not ask this question".

51:57.303 --> 52:03.346
So, and you have freedom to ask the question.

52:20.430 --> 52:23.864
He is asking how significant the colours are in the chakras.

52:23.864 --> 52:24.825
Hum?

52:24.825 --> 52:30.892
How significant are the colours to the chakras, cause he has read sometimes, that they are different colours.

52:32.429 --> 52:38.781
These are the colours which you see actually in the chakras.

52:38.781 --> 52:50.790
But supposing something wrong with the chakras is then maybe it may not look the same colour.  When they are healthy chakras they look of this colour.

53:08.371 --> 53:10.371
Yes?

53:10.642 --> 53:21.327
He says there seems to be a conflict in what he has read, some of these chakras are represented as different colours altogether.

53:22.683 --> 53:26.224
That is not so important, my child.

53:27.625 --> 53:37.660
You see, what you have to have is your Realization. That’s the main thing.

53:37.660 --> 53:49.015
Now supposing I am here, I am seeing you all, isn’t? I am inside.

53:49.015 --> 53:57.442
In the same way, when you're crossing through all these chakras, you just know you are inside it.

53:57.442 --> 54:01.431
But you don’t see any colours, nothing.

54:01.431 --> 54:06.815
You just see as if you are passing. Like I was coming now here,

54:06.815 --> 54:10.738
I was just coming to Wollongong.

54:10.738 --> 54:19.969
And I didn't see what was around, supposing. And even if I see, is not important, I haveto reach.

54:19.969 --> 54:30.330
So, that is not so important. The first thing you must get your Realization. All right?

55:15.390 --> 55:22.014
He wants to know a little more about what we mean by the Spirit

55:22.014 --> 55:26.589
and what, how that is related to our consciousness

55:26.589 --> 55:30.958
and how the two things are linked by Self-realization?

55:30.958 --> 55:40.352
It's a good question. Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within us.

55:40.352 --> 55:47.666
He said that, He has made human beings in his own image.

55:47.666 --> 55:52.780
Now we should not get confused with the word image. Image means the reflection.

55:52.780 --> 55:58.698
So, we reflect God Almighty.  We are not God but we reflect.

55:58.698 --> 56:05.468
Image is different from the actual thing.

56:05.468 --> 56:18.856
So, now when you are as a human being then the Spirit is just a witness in the heart watching you.

56:18.856 --> 56:25.400
And the seat of the God Almighty is here and He is reflecting in the human heart.

56:25.400 --> 56:35.303
He is just watching. He is a witness. He doesn’t come into your attention. He's watching you.

56:35.303 --> 56:49.772
But when Realization takes place, when Kundalini pierces through this, then it starts flowing into our attention, the light of the Spirit.

56:49.772 --> 56:57.234
The attention that we have is the consciousness.  We have general consciousness a human consciousness you can say,

56:57.234 --> 57:02.534
which is expressed through our central nervous system.

57:02.534 --> 57:14.150
For example, in our evolution, we have a consciousness which is much deeper and higher than that of animals.

57:14.150 --> 57:24.550
Like a dog or somebody, if you want to put him into some sort of a dirty place, it would stay there.  It won't have any problems to pass through.

57:24.550 --> 57:28.420
But a human being cannot because he can feel.

57:28.420 --> 57:36.308
We can feel the beauty, we can feel the colours, we can see so many things much subtler than animals do.

57:36.308 --> 57:40.200
And this is all through our central nervous system.

57:40.200 --> 57:49.431
So, whatever we achieve in our evolution is recorded on our central nervous system which manifests it.

57:49.431 --> 58:09.010
But when I am talking about Self-realization, then the Spirit manifests all our conscious mind, and this conscious mind becomes a special type of an enlightened conscious mind.

58:09.010 --> 58:19.116
And that conscious mind then when is completely in contact with his divine Power

58:19.116 --> 58:24.054
can control the parasympathetic nervous system which is within us.

58:24.054 --> 58:29.916
I do not know how many of you are medically equipped. But I will tell you what parasympathetic is.

58:29.916 --> 58:39.071
We have got a central nervous system and also we have another system called as autonomous nervous system.

58:39.071 --> 58:43.980
Now nobody knows what this "auto" is, but they named it "auto".

58:43.980 --> 58:53.164
Now, this system has got three other systems left and right sympathetic and the central system which we call as the parasympathetic.

58:53.164 --> 58:59.798
So, whenever we are in an emergency, we use these two sympathetic nervous systems left and right.

58:59.798 --> 59:05.994
Supposing we want to run then we run and our heart starts beating fast.

59:05.994 --> 59:16.051
This happens to the sympathetic activity but the parasympathetic activity brings it to the normal. We cannot bring it to the normal.

59:16.051 --> 59:27.868
So, what happens after this, your conscious mind which is enlightened can control your parasympathetic activities.

59:27.868 --> 59:37.260
Supposing a person is enlightened and another person, he meets, who has hurt himself and his bone has become crooked.

59:37.260 --> 59:47.473
He puts his hand on that bone and slowly the bone starts melting away and going to the normal state.

59:47.473 --> 59:51.995
After some time, he doesn’t even have to put [the hand] just attention.

59:51.996 --> 01:00:02.518
With the attention also he can do very simple things, because now your attention, which is the conscious mind, becomes enlightened.

01:00:02.518 --> 01:00:17.963
On the other hand, if you use your conscious mind too much, all the time thinking, planning futuristic thing going on, then what happens, this conscious mind becomes very, very sluggish weak or you can say extremely weak.

01:00:17.963 --> 01:00:23.535
And this I told people in America about 8-10 years back that you will get a disease

01:00:23.535 --> 01:00:29.177
by which your conscious mind will become absolutely good for nothing.

01:00:29.177 --> 01:00:32.871
And that’s what has happened now, called as the yuppy's disease,

01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:37.888
where the conscious mind doesn’t work.  Unconsciously one may walk,

01:00:37.888 --> 01:00:43.502
one may lift the hand, one may do anything, but consciously he cannot.

01:00:43.502 --> 01:00:51.260
So, they just become like reptiles if you see them.On the television, I saw, it is shocking.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:57.466
They are just carried like big fishes on the shoulders of people.

01:00:57.466 --> 01:01:09.196
They can sit if they are fixed for sitting posture, they cannot talk but they think,

01:01:09.196 --> 01:01:13.878
they cannot write, they cannot do anything with the conscious mind.

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:18.452
On the contrary, when the conscious mind is enlightened

01:01:18.452 --> 01:01:33.334
it becomes a dynamic force and gradually your beauty, your glory starts opening and recording what you are on your conscious mind which is an enlightened one.

01:01:33.334 --> 01:01:41.366
It is a very good question but it requires more time but as it is I would say first you get your Realization

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:51.740
and gradually you will know how your conscious mind has become so alert.

01:02:07.694 --> 01:02:14.741
For the awakening of Kundalini can you suggest the best form of meditation?

01:02:14.741 --> 01:02:22.255
You see I was saying that we will be doing that process now and the Kundalini will be awakened.

01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:29.567
But as it is you have to be in meditation, you don’t have to do meditation.

01:02:29.567 --> 01:02:36.779
So first, I will do that today I’m sure all of you will get your Realization tonight definitely.

01:02:36.779 --> 01:02:47.431
After that, you have to come to the collective. Of course, you don’t have to pay anything there, but then you will know what are the problems you are having within yourself

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:54.989
and how to solve them. And once your connection is established, then there’s no question

01:02:54.989 --> 01:03:00.738
of you not realizing what you are

01:03:00.738 --> 01:03:04.249
and how many powers you have.

01:03:04.249 --> 01:03:09.453
That I am going to do just now.
