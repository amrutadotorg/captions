00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:13.156
What you are doing is just you are 
circulating your love into this Virataâ€™s body,

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:18.581
and so that the whole body feels the oneness. 
Thatâ€™s the situation.

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:23.685
Then the colors are, the colors are all 
representing your chakras.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:28.381
These are all the chakras as you know. 
Every chakra has got different color.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:35.665
So what happens? These colors just get
distributed in the air, in the atmosphere.

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.058
During Holi time you are representing those colors

00:00:39.178 --> 00:00:45.685
which are completely permeating into the atmosphere.

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:47.997
So this is another thing when you play colors.

00:00:48.117 --> 00:00:51.837
When you color another person, 
you are just expressing

00:00:51.957 --> 00:00:55.033
that these, your chakras, will be blessed.

00:00:55.153 --> 00:00:57.749
Red color is of the Mooladhara.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.685
All those colors that you use here 
are of different chakras.

00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:09.856
So just you are making the whole 
expression of your love

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:15.245
that let it be you become completely 
filled with red color,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.842
means innocence, means innocence.

00:01:17.962 --> 00:01:22.090
Because a child in the womb of the mother 
just sees the red color of the mother,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.627
color of the blood.

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:27.368
So like that you see different colors 
are spread on the face.

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:33.556
And green is the color of the guru tattwa.

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:39.999
Like that all these colors have got significance 
that they are the colors of your chakras

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.351
which you are spreading all over to your friends,

00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:46.646
to your other brothers and sisters 
who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.288
So it has that symbolic expression

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:54.313
that you are spreading actually 
the essence of your chakra,

00:01:54.433 --> 00:02:00.049
the basis of your chakra, the colors of your 
chakra, the fragrance of those chakras

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:04.059
to other Sahaja Yogis. 
You just permeate, permeating.
