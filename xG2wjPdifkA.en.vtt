00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:14.950
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:28.247
It is a very important thing about the power of Shri Krishna

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:33.516
that gives you a witness state.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.207
This is very important also because,

00:00:42.287 --> 00:00:55.086
in these days of Kali Yuga and
complete confusion of value system,

00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:07.667
all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:23.848
The state of witnessing is only possible through meditation:

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:28.498
you reach the state of thoughtless awareness.

00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:32.312
It’s combined together.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:40.716
Now the witness state is such a
state where you just do not react.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:49.735
If you react, then the problem starts.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:58.602
It’s a very simple thing to understand

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:08.126
that we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:18.081
Otherwise there is no way to react.

00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:26.585
But witness state is not a mental
state, it is a state of a spiritual ascent

00:02:26.665 --> 00:02:30.455
where you become a witness.

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:39.423
Best way to practice witness state is
not to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

00:02:39.503 --> 00:02:44.050
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing others.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.866
They cannot criticize themselves,
so they start criticizing other.

00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:53.128
So much so that they don’t even see what’s wrong with them.

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:57.023
They don’t even see what wrong they have done to others,

00:02:57.103 --> 00:03:00.822
because they think they have a right to criticize others,

00:03:00.902 --> 00:03:04.730
and they enjoy this criticism very well.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.739
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.342
You just watch and see for yourself.

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:14.371
That’s all is your right.

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:19.027
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

00:03:19.107 --> 00:03:21.971
But some people think if you do not criticize,

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:27.010
then it will go on like this and
it will never stop. It’s not that!

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.379
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just watch.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.802
Your attention itself is enlightened
now, with that enlightened attention

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:44.627
you can just watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:48.856
But we are always conscious that we are something great,

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:53.296
and we have to do this and we have to do that.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:04:01.678
Under these circumstances what
happens is that you become another problem.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:05.668
Because what can you do?

00:04:05.748 --> 00:04:08.200
You can’t do anything.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.548
But what you can do is to watch.

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:18.513
By watching and by just seeing things as they are,

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:24.696
you really develop a very different state of being.

00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:31.067
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,

00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:36.325
what happens to them is very interesting,

00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:39.482
that their memory loss is much less,

00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:43.500
because whatever they see becomes like a picture to them.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.426
Like you can say, they can tell you
even the color, the folding, everything.

00:04:49.506 --> 00:04:54.287
Whatever they see is so much in their mind like a photo,

00:04:54.367 --> 00:05:04.882
and they can tell you exactly what they
have seen, and your memory is not lost.

00:05:04.962 --> 00:05:12.505
While if you react onto everything,
your memory becomes horrible.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:17.049
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:23.988
It can be very, very dangerous, because
once you start losing your witness state

00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:29.457
you can fall into negative collectivity.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.859
And thus this negative collectivity acts,

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.852
acts in such a bad manner
that all the conflicts of the world,

00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:43.842
all the problems of the world perhaps are related with this.

00:05:43.922 --> 00:05:47.580
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

00:05:56.254 --> 00:06:03.612
We should not react, we should not react.

00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:14.785
If you see something wrong, all right,
you meditate on that point, you meditate.

00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:23.587
If you find anything wrong
happening, all right, meditate on that.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:29.024
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment do not react.

00:06:29.104 --> 00:06:36.596
Afterwards when that person is
quietened, you tell him or tell her.

00:06:36.676 --> 00:06:42.010
So this power of witnessing you all should develop.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:50.448
Try to develop it that when you are reacting, stop reaction,

00:06:50.528 --> 00:06:55.130
stop reaction about everything.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.597
You will be amazed, you will find
yourself a very, very powerful person

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:09.511
in the sense you’ll have no
ambitions, you’ll have no desires,

00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:14.189
you’ll have no special fondness or anything.

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:18.106
But just you are witnessing the drama.

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:27.277
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

00:07:27.357 --> 00:07:33.414
And when in the collective all
of you have that witness state,

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:43.691
you can do wonders without doing anything,
without saying anything, without acting

00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:47.497
- only your presence itself can work it out.

00:07:47.577 --> 00:07:52.521
I don’t say that it will have
effect on everyone, no, can’t say;

00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:56.343
but most of the people.

00:07:56.423 --> 00:08:07.876
Any person who is in that state, he is
the one who brings peace, he brings joy.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:17.355
As Shri Krishna has said, "You
have to be aware of your Self."

00:08:17.435 --> 00:08:22.855
First to get self-realization and
then to be aware of your position.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:27.975
Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:34.845
attention, and proper understanding.

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:37.565
Absolutely it is a easy thing to do

00:08:37.645 --> 00:08:45.685
as soon as you find that you
have achieved that witness state.

00:08:47.155 --> 00:08:53.835
So please try to make yourself a witness.

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:57.626
When you see something, go into thoughtless awareness

00:08:57.706 --> 00:08:59.403
that is your fort.

00:08:59.483 --> 00:09:03.549
Like these mountains how they
are steadily watching everything

00:09:03.629 --> 00:09:06.590
and emitting joy and beauty.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.716
In the same way, we have to become a witness.

00:09:11.796 --> 00:09:15.393
We need not talk too much, we need not keep quiet

00:09:15.473 --> 00:09:18.233
but in the center we should witness

00:09:18.313 --> 00:09:20.634
the whole thing as Leela.

00:09:20.714 --> 00:09:24.434
I wish you all very great luck for your witness state.

00:09:24.514 --> 00:09:32.304
In the witness state, we do not anyway
express ourselves in a funny manner

00:09:32.384 --> 00:09:37.844
but just in looking at ourselves.

00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:41.404
Because only we have created all the problems

00:09:41.484 --> 00:09:45.896
and it is we only, detaching ourselves from ourselves,

00:09:45.976 --> 00:09:49.464
can see these problems and can solve them.

00:09:49.544 --> 00:09:54.634
By God's Grace, as I know, you
all are going to grow very much,

00:09:54.714 --> 00:09:57.234
and this state is to be achieved.

00:09:57.314 --> 00:10:01.128
In every state whether it is a blessing,

00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:04.514
whether it is a progress or whether it is just turmoil,

00:10:04.594 --> 00:10:06.234
you have to be seaworthy.

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.822
Any ship which is a seaworthy is the one

00:10:08.902 --> 00:10:13.887
which can face all kinds of beautiful voyages

00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:17.460
or even turmoil and even the tempest.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:28.542
So what happens that when you are putting your attention

00:10:28.622 --> 00:10:32.355
so much to outside all the time,

00:10:32.952 --> 00:10:37.540
then you must first of all also divert your attention.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.899
All these things happen when your attention is diverted

00:10:42.979 --> 00:10:49.612
from criticising, from reacting,

00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:54.685
just you watch, become the
witness, try to witness everything.

00:10:54.765 --> 00:10:58.828
It's not so very yet practiced,

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:05.402
so far I've seen, that whenever even
we get our, achieve our realization

00:11:05.482 --> 00:11:10.336
we don't realize that we have to witness everything.

00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:14.956
When you start witnessing
through your spirit, then you don't see

00:11:15.036 --> 00:11:19.520
the bad points of another, but you see the good points.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.363
We just pick up a person with very good points.

00:11:25.443 --> 00:11:32.752
So once you see that the witness state enlarges

00:11:32.832 --> 00:11:38.674
and you start enjoying another person,
you start enjoying everything that is there.

00:11:38.754 --> 00:11:46.004
Even a small blade of grass you
can enjoy if you have that capacity.

00:11:46.084 --> 00:11:52.789
So you must practice as to
find out what stops your thoughts.

00:11:52.869 --> 00:11:55.253
What makes you the witness?

00:11:55.333 --> 00:12:00.648
Once you develop this habit you will station yourself nicely

00:12:00.728 --> 00:12:03.562
in the thoughtless awareness.

00:12:03.642 --> 00:12:09.873
Then you start watching how Sahaja Yoga has helped you.

00:12:09.953 --> 00:12:12.396
How it has been blissful.

00:12:12.476 --> 00:12:16.169
What you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:20.012
You will be amazed if you just start watching it

00:12:20.092 --> 00:12:26.759
everywhere you'll be amazed how this Paramachaitanya acts.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:39.111
Depends on how your Kundalini has risen.
If she has risen in a perfect manner,

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.265
then I have seen people at the first shot

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:47.345
they just become completely self-realized people.

00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:50.711
Of course there are very few, but there have been;

00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:57.211
while I see most of you have little problems,

00:12:57.291 --> 00:13:03.311
and for most of you it is the problem of the Agnya Chakra.

00:13:03.391 --> 00:13:07.944
How do we get the Agnya Chakra working so much is this,

00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:16.024
that we think as a reaction, as a reaction

00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:21.328
to anything outside, we react to everything.

00:13:21.408 --> 00:13:28.927
So humility is the, one of the criteria of a Sahaja yoga.

00:13:29.007 --> 00:13:34.461
A person who doesn’t have humility
cannot be called sahaja yogi.

00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:38.227
I have seen even sahaja yogis get very angry,

00:13:38.307 --> 00:13:42.561
sometimes start shouting and getting angry and misbehaving.

00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:47.761
That’s the sign that he is not yet a
sahaja yogi, he has to still mature.

00:13:47.841 --> 00:13:58.461
So this humility of a person will
give you more stationary, I would say,

00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:08.147
more permanent state by which you will not react,

00:14:08.227 --> 00:14:12.860
you will not react. You look at anything, you react.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.494
But then you don’t react, you just watch,

00:14:15.574 --> 00:14:20.761
and that is how the new state
of witness state comes into you.

00:14:20.841 --> 00:14:25.428
When you become the witness you are just watching,

00:14:25.508 --> 00:14:34.528
just watching; not reacting, not thinking
about it, but you are in the present,

00:14:34.608 --> 00:14:41.061
and in the present you just watch,
watch and really enjoy it.

00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:49.494
The enjoyment of all the creation is not
within your mind when you are thinking.

00:14:49.574 --> 00:14:57.561
And when you are not thinking, the whole
enjoyment of the beauty of all this creation

00:14:57.641 --> 00:15:03.328
reflects in you, and gives you tremendous joy and peace.

00:15:03.408 --> 00:15:08.960
So one has to learn that we should not react.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:14.561
The today’s problem is, all human
beings are very good at reacting.

00:15:14.641 --> 00:15:18.960
Reaction is a basic principle of today’s life.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.960
You see any newspaper, you see any book, you meet anyone,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.094
what I find that they are experts on reacting. They react,

00:15:30.174 --> 00:15:40.294
and by reaction what happens, they
never achieve any essence of the thing.

00:15:40.374 --> 00:15:46.483
Essence is only through witness state that you can achieve.

00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:54.715
First and foremost is your Sahasrara.

00:15:54.795 --> 00:15:58.569
Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of the Divine.

00:15:58.649 --> 00:16:01.903
So, your Sahasrara is extremely important.

00:16:01.983 --> 00:16:06.090
You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.974
to cure it, to make it completely
nourished by the Kundalini.

00:16:11.054 --> 00:16:16.476
We are the ones who are going to
support, look after the Satya Yuga.

00:16:16.556 --> 00:16:23.745
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening
is very, very important, it’s very important.

00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:31.886
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:34.000
whatever time you may come home,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.508
maybe in the morning, maybe in the evening, anytime.

00:16:37.588 --> 00:16:40.199
But you will know that you are meditating

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:44.748
when you can get into thoughtless
awareness, then you will know.

00:16:44.828 --> 00:16:46.650
Your reaction will be zero.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.924
Look at something you will just look at it,

00:16:49.004 --> 00:16:52.727
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

00:16:52.807 --> 00:16:56.681
You won`t react. When that reaction is not there

00:16:56.761 --> 00:17:01.737
then everything, you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

00:17:01.817 --> 00:17:06.192
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

00:17:06.272 --> 00:17:09.635
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.859
you are one with the Divine.

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:16.751
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

00:17:16.831 --> 00:17:21.841
every moment of your life and looks after you.

00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:25.979
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:29.049
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

00:17:29.129 --> 00:17:31.503
May God bless you!
