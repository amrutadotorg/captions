00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:15.720
Today, it’s a great day for all of us, the seekers,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:23.320
that the last work of the Divine,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.400
of opening the last centre

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.160
in the Great Primordial Being,
was done on the 5th of May 1970.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:46.840
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.080
It was done with very great care and great adjustments.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:07.280
It is not in the limits of human understanding,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.800
how things are worked in the heavens.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.480
It is your fortune and God’s love

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.360
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.120
Without this happening, there could not have been

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.760
a possibility to give mass Realisation to people.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.600
One could have done it for one
or two persons here and there,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.200
but to give such a mass awakening
could not have been possible.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:02.640
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there
are the seats of the seven main chakras.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.520
There are one thousand nadis or, as they call it, flames,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.640
and they all have each sixteen thousand powers.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.680
Every nadi deals with a particular type of a person

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.960
and, with the permutations and combinations

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.480
of all these nadis, human beings are looked after.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.080
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:53.080
the whole atmosphere was filled with tremendous chaitanya

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.360
and the whole thing came on this Earth

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.640
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.840
with such a tremendous force,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.560
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.120
The happening was so unexpected and so tremendous

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:37.280
that I was stunned and I became
completely silent at its grandeur.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:48.120
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like a big furnace,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:58.520
and the furnace was very silent
but a burning appearance it had:

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.640
as if you heat up some metal and it
has many colours, in the same way,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.680
the Kundalini showed up like a huge furnace, you can say;

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.960
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:29.040
where you see these plants you have
for coal burning to create electricity;

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.760
and it stretched like a telescope one after another,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.360
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot, like that.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.800
And the Deities came and sat on their seats,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.480
on their golden seats,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:56.520
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.000
like a big dome,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.520
and opened it,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.960
and then this torrential rain

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.920
completely drenched me

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.320
and I started seeing all that and got lost into the joy.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.880
It was like an artist seeing its own creation fulfilled.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.960
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:39.080
After coming out of that beautiful experience

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.320
I looked around and I saw human beings so blind

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.080
and I became absolutely silent.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.560
Then I desired that I should
get the cups to fill this nectar.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.400
But I saw all stones.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:12.840
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part of your being.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.000
It is a big lotus with one
thousand petals of different colours

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.440
appearing like inflated flames.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.440
It is a thing which is seen by many people

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.640
but to see it pour that torrential rain

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.160
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.880
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.240
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.960
People have written very little about Sahasrara,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.760
because whatever they have seen is from outside

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.920
and it’s not possible for them to go from inside.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.880
Even if you reach from inside, if the
whole Sahasrara is not opened out,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.400
you cannot see its beauty;

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.680
because when it is closed, the whole of it, the total,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.040
then you just pass through a
little aperture and get out of it.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:39.720
But just imagine a huge big petaled, thousand petaled lotus,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.520
and you are sitting inside, in the
corona and looking at all these petals —

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.840
all very beautifully coloured, and fragrant,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:57.160
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:10.720
To remain into Sahasrara, on
that position, is the ideal situation.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:21.480
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:29.240
and you are drawn out to people

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:37.800
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.480
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.960
and then you start seeing the
problems that exist in the Sahasrara.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:04.160
And even if you desire to ope the
Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:12.640
because the channelising from the Divine to human beings

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.440
has to be through human beings.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.280
The power could be with you,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.000
but it has to be channelised through human element.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:34.000
All My life I had not known many realised-souls.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.320
How to get them?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.560
How to work it out?

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.560
So I started looking out for people,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.200
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.960
and she was very perturbed about something very gross;

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.760
and when she came to Me she felt very peaceful.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.200
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:08.240
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.160
And her brain would be covered with clouds

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.880
and darkness.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.400
Again and again I had to enlighten it

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.240
but she did not get her Realisation.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.760
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.120
This capacity I had from childhood.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.760
And I could also give Realisation to a few people before,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.000
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.320
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.160
because I was not living in the forest,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:54.840
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.720
and they were not that earnest, that aartha,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.120
and I had to do this work among them.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.400
How to talk to them about the real world that exists

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.480
and the false [one] in which they live?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.720
And one lady, the first one who
got Realisation, just came to see Me

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.960
because she was possessed with
the idea of seeking, she thought,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.440
and it worked in her.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.800
That was not the happiest day,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.480
because she’s one of those who get individually Realisation.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.400
With this great happening many should get at a time.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:47.200
We had a programme in Bordi in ’70,

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.360
and there, first, one gentleman
got Realisation in the evening.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.240
Next day there were negative
forces acting [in the] morning time,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.800
and they started talking of favouritism.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.560
I could see in the atmosphere
the vibrations were going wrong.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.320
In the evening I took up a very strong, firm attitude.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.320
I was in a great fury.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.240
I had never gone into such a fury before

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.720
and I lashed out at them.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.520
Surprisingly, twelve of them got Realisation,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.200
That was the greatest moment.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.400
Then many got, one by one.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.080
Three of them who were travelling back, got Realisation.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.440
Suddenly, in the train, they felt the vibrations.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.800
So the mass evolution started.
