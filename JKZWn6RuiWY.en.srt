1
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:35,699
Yesterday, you have been explained about the
subtle being within us, a subtle instrument

2
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,559
within us, described in the Bible as Tree
of Life, working out this last breakthrough

3
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,860
of Self-realization. And this happening is
a living happening, a spontaneous happening,

4
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:37,049
the way a seed sprouts spontaneously when
it is embedded in the Mother Earth. The problem

5
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:52,369
with the human mind is such that he thinks
or it thinks that it can work out its own

6
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:07,249
realization, its own emancipation.
We do not understand a simple thing that at

7
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:25,390
the human level, we do not do anything that
is living. We cannot germinate a seed even

8
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:38,110
on that. We cannot even create anything that
is dead. We can just transform one dead into

9
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:51,230
another form. But we cannot understand that
whatever we may try, we cannot lay our hands

10
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:07,909
on the living process. Only after Self-realization
you are entitled. You get powers to do living

11
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,579
work.
That is the sign of a person who is born again,

12
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:28,579
who is a yogi, who has had a union with the
Divine. It is not those who proclaim or announce

13
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,540
or advertise that we are something special
selected people that we have the powers or

14
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:54,239
that we can take you to Divine. One can really
produce results. Results can only be produced

15
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,719
of living process when you have the power
of your spirit.

16
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:16,230
We have heard about Christ who cured people
and He cured at that time -- in such a short

17
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:29,070
time as it was hardly about twenty-one people
â€' and He was crucified. We could not

18
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,690
bear the truth that He was the Son of God.
Now, maybe one may create big huge organizations

19
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,190
in His name, make big money in His name and
do all kinds of things, but when He was there,

20
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:55,190
He was present, they denied Him.
So as we see within ourself there is this

21
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,860
power which has to manifest, we should be
very anxious to get our Self-realization.

22
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,840
If I say there is a diamond available here
-- just free, it's your own â€' people

23
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,730
would come not only from San Diego but also
from Australia, India, Japan and all over

24
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:31,730
the world asking for it. But when I say, "There
is this diamond within you in your heart,"

25
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,370
still we are identifying with so many falsehoods
that we do not want that diamond to shine

26
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:50,170
in our attention. It is a surprise. But I
am not surprised because we are still ignorant.

27
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,120
We do not know how beautifully we are made,
how in our evolutionary process we are built

28
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:12,270
in so beautifully -- the whole information
about the truth. Only this machinery has to

29
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,940
work out. Only this has to get connected with
the Divine.

30
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,520
If we really logically, intelligently understand
that the living process has to work spontaneously

31
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,580
and you can't do anything about it, you can
understand how Sahaja Yoga works. It's all

32
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,290
there. One does not have to do anything. It's
all there, like a little seed. A minutest

33
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,900
one maybe has all the maps of all the trees
you'll be able to produce. In the same way,

34
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,900
within you lies this potential which is to
be manifested.

35
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:15,410
We have been also told about the left and
right side within us. Left and right side

36
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,060
are the only two sides to which our attention
can go, which represents our sympathetic nervous

37
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:34,340
system. That is when you go into any emergency.
Suppose you are rushing somewhere or running,

38
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:41,900
your sympathetic goes into action and creates
the results necessary for that action. For

39
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:53,060
example, you have to run; so the sympathetic
will start pumping the blood fast, will start

40
00:07:53,270 --> 00:08:00,270
breathing fast. But what brings it back to
normal is the central path, what we call represented

41
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:12,430
in the medical terminology as parasympathetic
nervous system. So in our own effort we can

42
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:20,340
only go to the left or right. But when we
try to go too much to the left or right, we

43
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,810
create problems, which we cannot explain and
we cannot understand.

44
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,779
The first and foremost problem we create is
the physical problem. Today there are so many

45
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:41,779
diseases. We cannot understand how these diseases
came into being and what is the nature of

46
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:52,110
its creation or how are we going to get rid
of this. Everybody is afraid of that unknown

47
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:02,130
disease and these unknown diseases can fall
up to anyone, whatever you may say, unless

48
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:11,270
and until you become a spirit. How they are
caused is a very simple thing to understand.

49
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,460
The physical problems come to us because of
our imbalances.

50
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,460
In various ways we try to go to the left or
to the right. Now, let us see how cancer is

51
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,000
caused because that is the headache of today,
or maybe of yesterday -- today's headache

52
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is something else. Cancer is caused only because
we do not keep to our temperament right. If

53
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,750
I say that this is the center that is formed
by the left and the right side, then this

54
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,580
center is providing the necessary vital energy
to the left and right side equally. But supposing

55
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:21,380
you are a very futuristic person, you are
planning too much, thinking too much, then

56
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:28,380
what do you do? You use your right side too
much. As a result this moves this way.

57
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:38,010
Also, the center now constricts. There is
no space in between left in the center for

58
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,529
the vital energy to flow. At this juncture
when you have moved too much from the left

59
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:55,529
side, if any emotional disturbance comes in
or if you go to somebody who is practicing

60
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,480
black magic and all kinds of left-sided negative
things, or else you might get weak with an

61
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,490
accident or a shock, this breaks, and when
this center breaks, you lose your connection

62
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,340
with the center. The controlling agency that
is the central nervous system does not play

63
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,920
any more part. What happens to you is that
the growth of the cells become malignant -- means

64
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:47,340
they grow on their own. There is no relationship
to the growth of other cells.

65
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:54,340
For example, suddenly you'll find such a person
will have a nose increasing in size or you'll

66
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,140
find an ear increasing in size overpowering
all others or we can say that it becomes a

67
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:08,140
very dominating cell. This is a simple thing
that happens in cancer. Luckily, we have now

68
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:17,840
in Delhi University the understanding of Sahaja
Yoga very well because we have cured many

69
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,140
people of very -- somehow they were very highly
placed in life of cancer and other diseases.

70
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:34,779
So they have accepted it for a doctorate,
and two doctors have got now their MD in two

71
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,800
subjects -- one was a psychosomatic disease.
One of the psychosomatic disease is cancer.

72
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:51,070
There are so many others -- and another one
who has got his doctorate is in the physical

73
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:59,710
fitness and vulnerability. Now there are seven
other doctors in London who are doing research

74
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,620
on it (AIDS?) ....and its remarkable how after
realization you get out of the clutches of

75
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,130
physical sickness.
So what happens when the kundalini rises,

76
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:24,130
what she does, she pierces through this constricted
chakras, repairs it and brings it back to

77
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:34,230
its normal position, repairs it. And I have
seen our President of India getting cured

78
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:43,650
of his cancer in ten minutes time, that too
on the aeroplane. But it's easy to deal with

79
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:54,460
an Indian because they know what is a kundalini
and they know what is a saint. They will not

80
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,520
easily take to these fake persons.
Though you are great seekers of a very high

81
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:14,130
quality, that understanding is there in India
more because they know more about the roots

82
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:23,740
and not about the tree, as you know more about
the tree. But it's such a barrier in understanding

83
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:31,779
that three hundred years English ruled in
India, they could not learn a word. Today,

84
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:41,890
it's amazing to see such a difficult Sanskrit
verses about the Primordial Mother written

85
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:51,339
by Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth century,
which many Indians will find it difficult

86
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:00,700
to sing, it's so beautifully sung. The whole
mantras, as they say, are beautifully rendered

87
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:12,190
that even a well-equipped Brahmin cannot do,
by people who are not from India. They don't

88
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,050
even know Sanskrit language.
How this has happened is the manifestation

89
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:27,050
of the spirit. The manifestation of the spirit
gives you a dynamic personality. This dynamism

90
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,880
comes to you. You can sing whatever you like,
you can draw whatever you like, you can paint

91
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:45,350
whatever you like. There are so many people
who have become great orators and musicians,

92
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:52,350
especially in India, because my work mostly
has been in India. Of course, not that I am

93
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,080
not concerned about the West. I have been,
as I told you, many a times in America.

94
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:10,649
But to understand the reality, the first thing
we must know that money has nothing to do

95
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,540
with the living process. In America, you'll
be surprised, there has been a business offered

96
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,750
to me that the cool breeze that I blow, if
I can bottle it up, they can sell it. Everything

97
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,240
goes into a business proposition, and that's
why it is so difficult. For example, you have

98
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:57,990
seen near -- of course, I must say you are
great people that you have come to a program

99
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:07,149
which has nothing to do with money -- it is
something really remarkable, I must say. But

100
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:17,309
today if I was talking in India or if I was
visiting even a small village, there would

101
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:24,669
have been minimum ten thousand people -- minimum
â€' and they would get all their realization.

102
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:36,750
The seeking is in the West, they are honest
seekers, but what to seek is the knowledge

103
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:49,090
which is in the East. It's something like
somebody have the teeth but no food, and those

104
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:56,429
have food have no teeth on one side and on
the other side they have teeth but no food.

105
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:06,989
It is such a simple thing to get rid of your
physical problems â€' is the easiest â€'

106
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:16,169
and the second comes is the problem, as they
say, is of stress, which is a common disease

107
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:25,249
in the West, is stress. What is the source
of stress within us? The source of stress

108
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:34,549
is very simple that when we think -- I mean,
these days the amount of thinking we do -- first

109
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:43,909
of all when I came to America, I was very
confused because of the choices you had. You

110
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:55,159
walk into any bathroom -- you better ask the
owner how do you operate, otherwise suddenly

111
00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:01,950
you'll find you have fallen into a big swimming
pool; suddenly it opens out for you. Or maybe

112
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,950
you open some sort of a shower and it becomes
a torrential rain -- so many choices which

113
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:20,820
maddens you completely.
What is there to choose about how you'll have

114
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:28,610
your scissors? As long as the scissor work,
it should be all right. It is so complicated

115
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:36,590
because so much of machinery -- they have
to produce so many things, so many varieties!

116
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:43,909
Right from A to Z, whether it is a dress,
whether it is a hair-do, whether it is a carpet,

117
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:51,249
or it is an ordinary thing which we call as
the handle of the car. Before getting into

118
00:19:53,489 --> 00:20:00,489
the car better ask the driver how it operates
otherwise you'll be lumped?[locked]. There

119
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:07,600
is no uniformity kept about these useless
material things and so the choices are so

120
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:14,460
many. You go to a shop, you go mad -- you
don't know what to buy.

121
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,460
You just ask them, "I just need a, some, say,
powder for my body." "Now, which one you want?

122
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,110
This one? This one?" They'll give you thirty-two
things. You start wondering, "Oh, God! I have

123
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:36,110
only one body and thirty-two things." It is
so difficult to locate something that you

124
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:43,730
need because you really don't know -- this
is natural, number one; this is absurd, number

125
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:50,450
two -- like that goes on and on and on, the
list for a small nonsensical thing like that.

126
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,320
Then tomorrow you go in the market, you find
that's gone out of market. Now another thirty-two

127
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:02,320
things have come!
All such maddening things put you to thinking,

128
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:13,539
"What should I do?" Then we have to plan out
everything in the future. It is so much so

129
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:23,929
that by temperament, people have become futuristic.
Like they are sitting here listening to Me,

130
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:31,549
but they are thinking, "Now, how will I go
home? And what food I will be eating? Then

131
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:38,039
what music I will have?" They are sitting
here at present but thinking about something

132
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:45,039
....They are too much planning. They do not
know the plan of the Divine. They'll plan

133
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:53,179
it out: rush, go forward, do this, go to the
airport. What has happened? The plane is delayed

134
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:01,279
three hours! Why? Because their condition,
holiday cancelled. They had planned the holiday

135
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:10,279
a year ahead. Poor things, you see, packed
everything to go somewhere. Holiday had to

136
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:18,090
be cancelled because the planes are not moving.
So they sit down on the airport. See, they're

137
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:25,090
waiting for something to happen. Nothing happens;
they go off.

138
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:32,869
But a yogi does not plan. He knows what's
going to happen. He does not bother. But supposing

139
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:46,669
a yogi gets lost on the way. Then he thinks,
"All right, if I am lost there must be something

140
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:56,590
here. I must see it. I am there with myself.
I am not lost. So let's enjoy." After all,

141
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:03,590
what are we going to miss? It is something
one has to see that as we are so much stressed

142
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:12,909
and under the domination of these watches,
that we all the time rush, rush, rush. Even

143
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:24,539
the jobs that we do, we are supposed to rush.
You will rush as much as you like but the

144
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,840
problem is your mind also rushes with it and
the whole personality gets involved into it.

145
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:42,330
But if you have seen a wheel, the whole wheel
moves but the axis has to be steady. If the

146
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:52,129
axis also starts moving, there is stress.
That's exactly what happens to us that we

147
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,970
start moving with all the tensions that are
so-called -- I call them [unclear]. There

148
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:09,659
is a center within us which we call as Swadhisthana
center. It's the second center which as you

149
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:16,659
see is working out the Void. We call this
as the Void -- not the Zen Void -- but this

150
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:25,409
is the Void, and this area is worked out by
the Swadhisthana which looks after the liver,

151
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:35,379
the pancreas, spleen, the kidneys and part
of the intestine.

152
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,820
Intestines, physically or in the medical terminology
we can say, the aortic plexus manifested by

153
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:50,049
this center works out. Now when the center
is doing this work in balance, it's all right.

154
00:24:54,929 --> 00:25:01,929
But when we think too much then the same center
has to convert the fat for the use of the

155
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:12,759
brain to make it into gray cells. But when
we think too much then it neglects other important

156
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:24,139
works which it has to do. So you get a liver
trouble.

157
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:31,139
I find at least fifty percent people in the
West are suffering from liver trouble. They

158
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:40,269
are not aware of it till they get to cirrhosis,
to skin troubles, this, that. They will not

159
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:47,419
know that they have a bad liver, till they
have jaundice or other diseases which are

160
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:57,879
caused by liver problems. Then we have people
who have lethargic livers also. So we have

161
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:07,679
two types of people who have lethargic organs
or overactive organs. So this Swadhisthana

162
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:15,059
Chakra cannot look after its duty in a balanced
way, creates a kind of an imbalance.

163
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:28,149
So you neglect your pancreas, you get diabetes.
It's a funny idea that is now prevalent that

164
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:39,070
we should not take sugar because â€' I
don't know from where it has come -- because

165
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:46,070
they think it causes you diabetes! It does
not. In India, in a village if you go, they

166
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:57,379
have to put so much sugar in the tea that
the spoon must stand at right angles â€'

167
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:05,139
otherwise they won't take â€' and nobody
has diabetes. They have never heard about

168
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:12,139
it, never. No. "What is diabetes? What is
that?" they'll say. The reason is they don't

169
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:20,509
think. They live for the moment. All right,
today is the work. Let's do this farming and

170
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:32,229
come home and sleep off. They don't think
too much. We think about everything, plan

171
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:41,779
out everything. Whatever is spontaneous also
we think about it!

172
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:50,229
Then the third thing that happens to you is
the trouble of the spleen. Now spleen is our

173
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:56,269
time-keeper. It gives us a rhythm. As you
have seen the rhythm today, in the same way

174
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:03,269
it's the rhythm of the life is kept by the
spleen. When you go into an emergency, then

175
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:11,070
the same spleen starts producing more red
blood corpuscles for your use. Now today's

176
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:19,220
life, as it is, is all the time shocking.
Early in the morning you read your newspaper.

177
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:30,479
I think this is one of the worst habits, because
as soon as you see the newspaper, the first

178
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:37,479
shock in the morning. Oh, God! So many dead.
Plane was crashed. War has started. Somebody

179
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:46,330
fell from somewhere. All horrible things in
the newspaper because newspapers don't believe

180
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:52,450
in giving something good news!
If there will be peace and happiness what

181
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:59,450
will they publish, I don't know. So they want
to give shocking news so there is some sensation

182
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:07,570
in the body. It has happened to such an extent
that now unless and until the music is sensational,

183
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:15,099
unless and until we get a shock all the time,
we do not react. Of course, the joy part is

184
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:23,159
missing -- no doubt about it. So this poor
spleen doesn't understand -- this personality

185
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:31,929
which is all the time under shock. Then you
get into our car and on the road there is

186
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:39,679
a jam. Finish! You had to reach at such and
such time; now it's a jam. Now you are cursing

187
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:47,690
everything, sitting down there worrying.
Suddenly you find an accident. Then you go

188
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,340
in the office or some place where you are
working. The boss has had a quarrel with his

189
00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:00,340
wife; so he comes and shouts at you -- another
shock. All the time you are facing very arrogant,

190
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,609
horrible people. I mean, I myself am afraid
to go to shops or anything because suddenly

191
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:15,609
they jump on you like a horse or sometimes
like a dog. God knows how they will react

192
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:23,739
on you. You get a fright. What's the matter
with them? Why are they so shocking? But all

193
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:30,739
of them are under stress and they are taking
it out on you. But the worst thing that happens

194
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:38,519
with this spleen going crazy is that you get
blood cancer. Blood cancer is caused by hectic

195
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:50,450
life and for speedy life that we lead. Now
the blood pressure comes from the kidney.

196
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:00,590
And like that so many things are caused by
one simple thing â€' that we think too

197
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:07,590
much. What is there to think? I just don't
understand. Whatever has to happen, will happen.

198
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:18,599
By thinking, nothing is going to stop. By
thinking we have achieved nothing. If you

199
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,320
read Einstein who has developed the theory
of relativity, at the very outset he says

200
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:33,389
that, "I was tired and I was lying down in
my garden, playing with soap bubbles and suddenly

201
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:42,359
from somewhere unknown the theory of relativity
dawned upon me." Whatever we have is there.

202
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:53,239
Whatever we have to find out comes from the
unknown, but thinking about it like mad just

203
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:59,960
ruins us. But if I say, "Don't think," you
can't stop thinking. I know that because we

204
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,580
had a wonderful doctor in Switzerland. He
came and said, "Mother, do what You like.

205
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,320
You cut my throat, You cut my head but stop
this thinking. I am going mad." So he developed

206
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,570
a momentum of thinking, all the time thinking,
thinking, thinking.

207
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:23,070
Now what happens with the kundalini, when
the kundalini rises, passes through your Agnya

208
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:30,070
Chakra, you go beyond thinking. It is like
one wave of thought comes up and goes down,

209
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:40,409
another wave of thought comes up and goes
down. In the center there is a little space;

210
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:44,889
so one comes from the past and goes to the
future, another from the future to the past.

211
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:51,679
In between there is a little space, and that
is the present. So when the kundalini rises,

212
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,690
passes through this Agnya Chakra â€' the
one that gives you thought is the ego and

213
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:03,690
the superego on both the side, as you can
see clearly -- they are sucked in; your karmas

214
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:12,090
are sucked in, your ego is sucked in, your
conditioning is sucked in and you stand at

215
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:17,320
the present moment.
Then if you want to think, if you don't want

216
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:24,320
to think, you just sit down in complete silence
and enjoy yourself. You become in command.

217
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:30,580
Like you are standing in the water, you are
afraid of getting drowned, but if you get

218
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:37,580
into the boat you enjoy the water. But supposing
you become a master swimmer, then you can

219
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:44,539
save others also from the water. This is exactly
what happens when a Sahaja yogi establishes

220
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:51,539
himself well, that he can give salvation to
so many and can save so many people. This

221
00:33:55,729 --> 00:34:02,729
is how we are going to emancipate.
Now the emotional side that we have is also

222
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:09,950
another extreme to which we bow? And with
the help of certain elements, you will be

223
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:16,970
surprised: one candle can at least cure twenty-five
mad people at least. It's very simple. If

224
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:29,919
you enlighten this light, then what happens
that enlightened light goes inside your left

225
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:41,379
side and enlightens it completely and all
the negativity disappears in your collective

226
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:51,109
subconscious. And you know who all suffer
from the left side of insanity, epilepsy,

227
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:59,139
schizophrenia, all this nonsense. Because
you stand in the center -- you are neither

228
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:07,940
on the left nor on the right -- if you are
in the center, you get rid of your emotional

229
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,839
problems.
Now, there are spiritual problems also. Before

230
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,839
as we have, I told you, thinking problem,
we have also physical problems like over-exertion.

231
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Now people are jogging. It's madness, I really
tell you. First, I thought there is some sort

232
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
of an earthquake that the old, young, everybody
running. What is happening? What's wrong?

233
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Where are you running? Because you are over-exerting
yourself. What is the need to over-exert yourself?

234
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:51,230
Because now a concept is that if you are muscular
-- I don't know whatever is the concept, every

235
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,900
day changing, every day you find new, new
things -- then you become over-efficient;

236
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,900
you become tired. It's absurd.
We have seen in history, say, we have got

237
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,920
the greatest statesman and the person who
saved us from this horrible Hitler was Churchill

238
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:18,039
and what a fat man he was. He never did jogging
in his life! I mean, you must accept your

239
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:32,660
body. It requires rest. For example, if I
start jogging, I'll be nowhere Myself because

240
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:39,660
I need a lot of water to protect the chakras
which work out the emancipation. To Me, that

241
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:48,049
is much more important than becoming some
sort of a cinema actress. There are many cinema

242
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,079
actresses. So what? What have they achieved?
How many people have they emancipated?

243
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:03,470
So what is your ideal in life is to be decided
first. Do you want to be all the time slave

244
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:10,510
of your body? And I don't know what you get.
I mean, these days nobody looks at no one.

245
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,640
They are fed up now and you can't make out
one from another because they go to the same

246
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:25,529
hairdresser. One fashion starts. I have to
think, "Is this he same person or somebody

247
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:32,700
else?" I mean, it is better to grow your beard
to look something different. I mean, there

248
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:42,529
no way of making out who is who! Everybody
has the same hair dress, everybody has the

249
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:49,529
same funny dress, everybody looking the same.
They have no personality. Tomorrow a wave

250
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,440
comes that you should put a plastic bag on
your head -- everybody will be moving with

251
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,049
a plastic head.
We have to have a personality. Why should

252
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:09,049
we dress up as everybody is dressing up? Such
a pressure. I know that because I have another

253
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:18,180
life which you know very well which is supposed
to be the high society -- so-called. And the

254
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:25,500
stupidest thing we discuss in that society.
Like they laugh at a woman if she is wearing

255
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:33,829
something that was, say, belonging to sixties.
I mean, what's the harm? No, that's not modern!

256
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:43,690
But what do you gain by becoming so modern
running with the fashion? What do you gain?

257
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:50,690
Now the fashion in England is to make holey
pants -- you make holes. Imagine that cold,

258
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:58,069
horrible cold that you have. What is the need
to make holes in your pant to get all kinds

259
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:03,930
of troubles? And then they'll have arthritis;
then they'll have this. First they had tight

260
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:10,930
pants; so they developed varicose veins. Now
they are having such loose pants that they

261
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:18,089
will develop arthritis. These people are managing
you. These manufacturers are befooling you.

262
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:28,940
This we cannot see because we have lost our
personality.

263
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:35,940
So we develop so many problems also because
we play into the hands of nonsenses. Now,

264
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:43,910
say, Indian people have lived for so many
ages now so they have learnt all the lessons.

265
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:50,770
If you go and tell them that you wear a holey
pant they'll say to/you, "Get lost! Sorry,

266
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:57,059
sir. We know everything." Now they are painting
their hair and when they are painting their

267
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:04,059
hair, people say, "Why are you painting their
hair?" "Oh, that's the fashion. What's wrong?"

268
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:13,390
But people become blind in that. We had three
patients who became blind because they painted

269
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:19,680
their hair and some sort of a thing -- punk,
punk. They were three blind punks who came

270
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,680
to Sahaja Yoga.
Actually, you have to punch them to talk to

271
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:35,510
them. This is the society in which we live.
Anybody who is sane will think I am mad. Like

272
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:44,019
going to a lunatic asylum, you start thinking,
"Am I mad or they are mad?" That's how it

273
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:52,829
creates a stress on us. Let us live with our
own dignity. You can see Mahatma Gandhi went

274
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,480
for his round table conference. He wore his
dhoti. He didn't wear a three-piece suit and

275
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:09,289
a tail coat -- that's another nonsense! Everybody
in England has to wear a tailcoat when they

276
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:17,289
go to the Queen's party. But they can't afford.
So they borrow; some are tight, some are loose.

277
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,970
And when you see them there -- I mean, I have
been to many of them -- you can't recognize,

278
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:31,970
and they look so absurd and clownish that,
poor things, you know all these big, big ambassadors

279
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:39,529
have to go about with that because it is supposed
to be a formal dress. I mean, what a formal

280
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:45,630
dress it is.
All these things pressurize you. They make

281
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:52,160
you feel, "Oh, you must wear a dress like
this." Even when you go to some guru, he says,

282
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,160
"All right, you all have to wear," say, "orange
dress." So you are forced into it; you have

283
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:07,500
to wear the orange dress. From where are you
going to manage -- getting rid of all this

284
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:17,660
nonsense of forcing you to do this and forcing
you to do that. But here you are so individualistic

285
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:25,470
and here you are a down-to-earth personality,
Its not that anybody says you have to do it

286
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:35,950
but you just do it because we have our own
personality. Individualism means personality.

287
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:44,539
And that is what when it is lost, you feel
also your guilt and your stress. That's possible

288
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:55,940
that you stand on in your own glory, in your
own personality, in your own understanding

289
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:02,940
of your spiritual value. So when that starts,
another style of movement comes in, like hippies.

290
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:14,190
We become like a primitive person, you become
like a hippy, you go about like a hippy, you

291
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:28,279
wear a funny dress, become a primitive personality
and think, "Oh, I have done very great thing."

292
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I had some hippies with Me, I told you yesterday.
So I asked them, "Why do you dress up like

293
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:46,900
this?" They said, "We want this kind of culture."
I said, "This is primitive." They said, "We

294
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,359
want to be primitive." I said, "You cannot
be. Your brain is modern. Just by wearing

295
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:59,359
these primitive things you cannot be. Accept
it, accept yourself. And now you have your

296
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:10,650
realization and it will work out."
So with all these stresses on us -- thinking

297
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:33,490
too much, futuristic personality â€' you
develop the stress. Now what happens when

298
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:42,240
kundalini rises, you are beyond thought. That's
called in Sanskrit as Nirvichar Samadhi -- thoughtless

299
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:52,670
awareness. You are fully aware -- on the contrary,
you are more aware â€' but you are in thoughtless

300
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:01,930
awareness. Now when I see this carpet in thoughtless
awareness, I don't think. I don't think because

301
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:08,210
if I have to think, "Oh, Baba, this is my
carpet. Now I have not insured it. If somebody

302
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:12,260
will run away with it, then what will happen?"
I won't be able to give any speech or anything.

303
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:19,260
I'll be worried about the carpet only.
But when I look at this carpet, I don't think.

304
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,200
Only the joy of the creation of this carpet
is just pouring into Me; a beautiful blissful

305
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,880
feeling, that's all. I am not thinking. Like
a very still beautiful lake which has no ripples

306
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:51,099
reflects all the beauty that is around it,
fully. A complete joy is reflected in a mind

307
00:45:53,420 --> 00:46:00,420
which is absolutely still, not reacting, not
accepting, just seeing, witnessing. And this

308
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:11,420
witness state comes into you and you become
a tranquil and a peaceful personality.

309
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Such peace that such a person, wherever he
goes, wherever he walks, a peaceful atmosphere

310
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:28,089
prevails. The nature, the elements all react
to such a personality. Just talking about

311
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,640
peace or giving prizes of peace, you do not
feel peace. I know of people who have got

312
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:46,579
Nobel Prizes of peace are horrid. They look
like some mad dogs. If you have to talk to

313
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:56,240
them, take the barge pole in between. Don't
know when you'll be hit with the prize they

314
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:03,240
have got. And you may have to pay very dearly
for meting such a personality who is supposed

315
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:11,019
to be the foundation of peace and you find
it's a fountain of violence. This is the situation

316
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:22,670
today that we are placed in a society which
artificially expresses itself. There 

317
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:21,980
is nothing genuine, nothing innate ...
