00:00:01.993 --> 00:00:06.403
Our respected Justice Y.K.

00:00:06.428 --> 00:00:13.183
Sahab, he is like
a son to me. It is a

00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:18.333
great pride for a mother to see

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:24.023
her son at such a high position.

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:35.947
All of you, residents of

00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:41.592
Bombay as well, many of

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:49.505
whom are blessed by Sahaja
Yoga, and also those

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.461
who have come here for the
first time today to accept

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:04.073
the love of the Lord,

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:09.071
I extend my greetings to all.

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:24.827
Justice Vaidya
Sahab, whatever he said,

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:35.382
he is a great scholar,

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:43.494
extremely learned, I
haven’t read much in life,

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:47.137
in terms of
books, but even after

00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:49.706
reading everything,

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:54.729
even after searching in all the

00:01:54.753 --> 00:01:58.283
books, he has a faith,

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:05.348
like that of Hanuman, that it’s

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:10.951
not in this either, not even in words;

00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:13.217
there’s only a hint, that thing has not been

00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:16.106
found yet, not found yet,

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:23.217
and as soon as it was found, it was
recognized as if it was already received,

00:02:23.328 --> 00:02:27.861
this is a very deep,

00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:33.594
special kind of faith.

00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:42.316
Most of the educated people have
never accepted God,

00:02:42.383 --> 00:02:45.782
you might be surprised
to know that it was a

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:49.681
judge who sentenced
Jesus Christ to crucifixion,

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:57.683
but look at the greatness
of this Kaliyuga, that a judge has

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.439
not only accepted that God, but
has also described Him so beautifully.

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:12.881
He himself has been a great personality
through many lifetimes, he doesn’t

00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:18.315
know much about himself yet;

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:23.749
that’s why the search remained for him.

00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:30.600
That’s why many people kept
searching, if you read all the philosophers

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:39.511
from the beginning until now, I haven’t
read them, but my disciples tell me,

00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:45.543
Recently, a very
learned French gentleman

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:52.465
came to London,
he too, as I say, became realized.

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:59.373
absorbed in worship, he wrote to me in

00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:01.639
a letter that from the
ancient times, every

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:06.605
philosopher has
indicated one thing, that

00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:14.483
we, who are made of
matter, our mind too is matter, finite,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.487
how
will it descend into the

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:28.509
subtle, how will it
descend into the infinite?

00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:32.331
The question is small, that we are

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:36.820
all made of matter and are limited,

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:41.487
finite, if God is

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:45.264
infinite, limitless,

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:50.351
then how can it descend into it,

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:55.406
and how can it be
known? If we try

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.461
with our mind to
know God, then we

00:05:00.485 --> 00:05:02.954
will read, write, books will open

00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:07.240
before us, but how

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:14.040
can we jump into it?
there, where our source is?

00:05:17.974 --> 00:05:20.996
The question stops here,

00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:29.707
the entire issue is only this one as,
how to descend from this inert body

00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:33.911
into that consciousness,
how to know

00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:38.692
that consciousness from this inertness.

00:05:43.114 --> 00:05:49.603
That’s why, until today, whenever
someone speaks about God,

00:05:49.825 --> 00:05:52.516
people laugh at it. Most
say, "Alright, they

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.955
talked about God,
maybe there is a God.

00:05:58.888 --> 00:06:03.368
“But if someone speaks
about other things, like

00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:07.677
how the world is
functioning, how the earth

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:10.443
is moving, even with
the earth moving so fast,

00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:15.574
we are not falling off, many such
arguments are given, and even if it is

00:06:15.598 --> 00:06:17.334
accepted by the intellect

00:06:17.673 --> 00:06:22.025
that there is a great
power behind all this

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:30.088
that is running the
world, still, how will the

00:06:30.133 --> 00:06:35.811
human intellect know it,

00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:39.722
how will it understand it?

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:47.574
For instance, let's say you sit and sing
a hymn, stand on your head, break your

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:55.330
neck, do yoga, live in the jungles, and

00:06:55.618 --> 00:07:02.707
remember God; yet the wall remains.

00:07:03.732 --> 00:07:08.330
For this, something needs to happen,

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:13.925
so that a human being
can immerse into that

00:07:14.015 --> 00:07:19.009
infinite, into that limitless.

00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:27.448
Indian scientists have not
yet reached that edge,

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:31.182
where Western
scientists have reached.

00:07:31.359 --> 00:07:35.492
This is unfortunate, those people have

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:38.524
reached that edge, that brink,

00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:41.047
where they are saying,
like psychologists,

00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:47.936
psychologists are
saying that now there

00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:53.392
should be some kind
of psycho synthesis,

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:55.623
meaning that our mind, which is divided

00:07:55.647 --> 00:08:01.784
into many parts, should
somehow become one.

00:08:03.177 --> 00:08:08.127
They have even started
talking about the Higher Self,

00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:13.101
because they encounter
many patients who say that they

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:16.221
have experienced something
of the Higher Self, they had

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:21.494
some strange experience.
They call them patients.

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:28.672
People are engaged
everywhere, trying to figure this out, but

00:08:28.696 --> 00:08:33.739
still, again and again,
they say, that from this inert

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:38.713
power, from this inertia,
we cannot descend into that

00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:43.686
infinite, into that limitless,
and so we should not

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.881
even attempt it, because
as soon as we try, then all the

00:08:48.905 --> 00:08:54.635
dormant inert powers
within us start running;

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:59.460
That is to say, just as in Russia, they
conducted many experiments,

00:08:59.484 --> 00:09:04.278
and in America too, due
to those experiments, they

00:09:04.302 --> 00:09:09.403
observed that wheat began
to flow, rice began to flow,

00:09:09.427 --> 00:09:14.527
someone saw that all of a
sudden things began to rise

00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:19.368
from the base,
the table began to lift and

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:24.776
move there; but their minds
became completely disturbed.

00:09:27.203 --> 00:09:32.404
In Russia especially, people
conducted such experiments,

00:09:32.428 --> 00:09:36.514
their books have been published, if you
ever read them, you too will understand,

00:09:36.603 --> 00:09:40.158
they say that it did not bring us peace.

00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:45.663
Strange experiences
began to occur, what are

00:09:45.858 --> 00:09:51.213
these powers that are
entering us? They don't realize

00:09:51.435 --> 00:09:58.571
that this is our subconscious,
our dormant mind, which is

00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:04.199
collectively within us, and
whatever is dead is also within us.

00:10:04.223 --> 00:10:09.730
Those dead people are
helping us, don’t forget this.

00:10:09.989 --> 00:10:15.826
Some scientists came to me, they are from
a very big country, they are very great

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.271
scientists, some of them
even reached the moon,

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:22.492
they came and said to
me, "Mother, we want

00:10:22.516 --> 00:10:25.351
to know how we can
fly in the sky," they

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:29.160
experimented with it, you
would be surprised...The

00:10:29.184 --> 00:10:35.384
scientist in India hasn't yet reached the
point where he thinks about these things.

00:10:35.408 --> 00:10:41.384
It's good that we are a little behind in
science;

00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:44.824
I said, son, why do you
want to fly?You have

00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:48.592
already reached the moon,
what more do you want?

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:55.747
He replied, we want to fly in
the sky without anyone's help.

00:10:56.014 --> 00:11:00.588
I said if I tell you that ghosts
help you in this, will you do it? He

00:11:00.612 --> 00:11:05.658
said, yes, we will do it because a
certain country is also doing the same.

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:09.388
I said, if those people are
relying on ghosts, why do you

00:11:09.457 --> 00:11:12.967
want to get involved with
ghosts, son? Stand firm on your

00:11:13.014 --> 00:11:17.014
own strength. Going to the
moon is not a very significant

00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:22.993
thing; today, the whole world
has advanced so much.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:26.201
We still have some issues
here, but they will be resolved.

00:11:26.225 --> 00:11:29.948
The issues of food and drink have
been resolved in those countries;

00:11:30.037 --> 00:11:33.860
Most of the problems in those
countries have been solved,

00:11:33.884 --> 00:11:37.706
but the people of that world
are unhappier than you are.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.017
There is fire in every home;

00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:44.786
fathers are devouring their
children, children are devouring

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.594
their fathers, there's no trace
of mothers, no trace of sisters.

00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:52.126
UNCLEAR

00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:56.462
Such tragic experiences have
filled their lives that they don’t believe

00:11:56.487 --> 00:11:59.989
in God, nor do they believe
in any happiness, as if there

00:12:00.013 --> 00:12:03.327
is nothing in the world
that brings joy.

00:12:03.394 --> 00:12:10.662
They are so internally tormented.
Science cannot comprehend this

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:17.954
because science deals with
everything separately, individually.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.226
It has a connecting
power, Kundalini,

00:12:26.193 --> 00:12:30.343
These people talked about Kundalini You
will be surprised if you have read a lot;

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:35.959
I don't have to explain
Kundalini to those people.

00:12:37.976 --> 00:12:43.276
Where are the educated people in our
country? Know about, forget about you,

00:12:47.323 --> 00:12:53.056
Now they also believe that Kundalini Apart
from awakening, man cannot reach that surf,

00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:57.068
But there are thousands
of discussions about that

00:12:57.092 --> 00:13:01.289
too There is in the world
the Kundalini that awakens,

00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:08.375
This happens to him, that happens,
I have seen from the descriptions,

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:12.138
That people start jumping,
screaming, shouting,

00:13:14.072 --> 00:13:20.632
Kundalini which is your mother, It is
possible for all this to happen due to his

00:13:20.656 --> 00:13:24.680
awakening. It sounds strange,
but its true meaning is this.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.153
That is not the awakening
of Kundalini While this is

00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:31.649
happening, there is an
awakening of some evil lord,

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:43.732
Now the thing is that to
descend into this infinite,

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:49.122
If everyone has accepted

00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:54.020
You people have not accepted
that Kundalini is its only meaning.

00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:59.034
Because the scientists here
don't even read it, what should I do?

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:02.587
Still we have to think about this

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.584
That for the awakening of Kundalini,

00:14:07.435 --> 00:14:11.401
What arrangement has God made?

00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:19.513
As today's topic is
'Experience God's Love',

00:14:22.263 --> 00:14:28.880
Experience God's love in our books,
many have written, but no one believes.

00:14:30.346 --> 00:14:38.030
Like Prahlad in front
of whom Narsingh' wasincarnated,

00:14:38.563 --> 00:14:43.233
and when he asked
what he wanted, Prahlad

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:47.439
asked him only one thing,
"Tava charana rakhiye preet"

00:14:47.672 --> 00:14:55.516
May I be blessed with  the love of Thy lotus feet.
Please give me this Lord!

00:14:55.806 --> 00:15:00.260
That Prahlad is no more
in the world today, and

00:15:00.284 --> 00:15:04.737
No, there is no such thing
as an incarnation of Narsingh.

00:15:05.153 --> 00:15:09.486
That's why everything
seems to be false and fake,

00:15:11.686 --> 00:15:15.491
These are all lies, there
is no meaning in them.

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:19.974
All the things like
incarnation etc. are false.

00:15:20.574 --> 00:15:23.324
This is what has been
said to mislead people,

00:15:30.357 --> 00:15:32.921
Ok,

00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:38.138
Man thinks himself so intelligent
It seems like it's not a good thing,

00:15:41.771 --> 00:15:45.529
But when you say Kalyug

00:15:45.553 --> 00:15:50.352
Has come, and the great
extreme Kalyuga has come,

00:15:53.255 --> 00:15:57.819
When every man suffers
from its bite completely writhing,

00:15:59.086 --> 00:16:03.576
Diseases like cancer are
eating away at the body.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.900
Immense sorrow is pounding
 on humans bengs,

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.700
no one has any trust, no one trusts
anyone Nobody's brother, nobody's sister,

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.148
No relationship is true in this world,

00:16:21.548 --> 00:16:28.398
At that time, who would be
willing to talk about God's love?

00:16:30.665 --> 00:16:36.064
There is nothing to say, at this time,

00:16:36.548 --> 00:16:43.148
never happened in this world,
this It is raining love for God!

00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:48.509
from all sides, don't you see that,

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.776
You can't know it.

00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:58.407
I believe this, because
you were made like this,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:06.507
That unconscious mind, that unconscious
The psychologist you are talking to,

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.390
About which complete
description has been given,

00:17:11.646 --> 00:17:14.538
There is some unconscious,
unconscious mind.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.462
He is helping us in some way,

00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:22.261
But we have no
connection with him,

00:17:23.395 --> 00:17:28.845
He makes his connections, he has his
shadow, but we are unable to find him.

00:17:32.011 --> 00:17:34.792
He is helping you in many ways,

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:43.694
For the first time he is
helping you in this way,

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.998
that one thought runs through
all mankind It has been, that we

00:17:48.022 --> 00:17:51.320
have to save time, we have to
save time, we have to save time.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.604
Time is wasting, time is wasting, But this
is where man's foolishness also comes in.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.810
That the time he is saving,
where is he wasting it?

00:18:06.303 --> 00:18:10.740
If he thinks even for a moment
that the time I am saving,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.090
Where should
I put it, then in it

00:18:15.114 --> 00:18:19.464
Balance will come upon
the humans of Kaliyuga,

00:18:19.714 --> 00:18:23.404
It is showering so immensely 
from God, to achieve

00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:27.660
that, you just need to
bring a little balance,

00:18:29.226 --> 00:18:35.459
You just told that Kundalini
is described in Yoga,

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:39.666
In Patanjali Yoga Shastra,
the way explained It has

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.060
been said that you will
have to do six types of things,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.805
You will have to live in the
forests, Guru's gathering It will have

00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:50.473
to be done, then this thing will go
somewhere and be made inside,

00:18:52.643 --> 00:18:56.860
Abhi (unclear) is a very big
Maharaj, he started saying that mother

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.610
21 thousand years of penance after this,
vibrations were out flowed in my hand,

00:19:01.877 --> 00:19:04.676
And you keep giving it
to these people like this.

00:19:09.418 --> 00:19:12.402
If you have read
Shankaracharya ji, then he

00:19:12.426 --> 00:19:15.410
Also wrote many verses
on Chaitanya Lahariya.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:21.084
Either he was a complete liar,

00:19:21.382 --> 00:19:23.920
And if they were not
liars, then those waves

00:19:23.944 --> 00:19:26.482
went away. Where,
about whom he had told,

00:19:30.199 --> 00:19:33.932
God who is unconsciously
present in the entire world,

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.770
There is nothing more
conscious than real,

00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:41.633
But we are unconscious,
we could not know it,

00:19:41.733 --> 00:19:45.333
We could not feel
it, we could not feel it;

00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:52.026
That's another thing, we have to get it.
No matter which religion you belong to,

00:19:52.376 --> 00:19:58.659
Be it any arrangement, any
Be it any race, any country,

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:04.307
Today in Kalyug, it
will have to be realized.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:16.700
Kalyug should end
from 1979, it has started.

00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:20.367
( thunderous applause )

00:20:20.684 --> 00:20:24.667
And there is talk of
Satya Yug coming in 1999,

00:20:24.692 --> 00:20:29.381
But talk should
not remain just talk.

00:20:30.698 --> 00:20:35.972
matter can remain matter only, if
You people don't accept the truth,

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:41.422
For a lie, even with a thousand
things, you will accept it.

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:44.994
Whatever be the lie, man
holds it with such force,

00:20:45.018 --> 00:20:48.172
Which has no limits,
but does not rest on truth,

00:20:49.239 --> 00:20:50.239
(will last, unclear)

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.993
Why did man bear so
much chastisement and pain?

00:20:58.527 --> 00:21:02.710
These things tear
apart a mother's heart.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.237
But what to do, man is not
going to believe without it,

00:21:08.753 --> 00:21:11.726
Not going to think about

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.722
it, Man is very stubborn,

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:20.715
very arrogant, arrogant,

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:25.948
And also always remains
dedicated to falsehood,

00:21:27.949 --> 00:21:30.732
Saw some miracles,
turned in that direction;

00:21:30.982 --> 00:21:34.879
Someone gave two paisa and
the round fell in that direction.

00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:39.605
Whatever untruths
are there, which That

00:21:39.629 --> 00:21:42.829
there is hatred in the
mind towards someone,

00:21:43.246 --> 00:21:47.960
Like I tell you, you are an Indian,
You hate people all over the world,

00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:50.610
So now all Indians
will become one,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:56.119
Let me say, you are a
resident of a land of yoga,

00:21:56.143 --> 00:22:00.551
You love the whole world,

00:22:00.609 --> 00:22:02.897
So people give me lectures,
Mother, you give lectures

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:05.209
to everyone. Teaching love,
whether they love us or not

00:22:06.592 --> 00:22:12.409
Such a man is
holding on to falsehood,

00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:18.660
That the truth is holding you, go
there Is there, but it is not accepted,

00:22:21.933 --> 00:22:25.024
He is so stubborn
that he swears by

00:22:25.048 --> 00:22:29.234
falsehood. Holding
on to it, not letting go;

00:22:29.317 --> 00:22:32.634
That's what he believes
in, that's everything.

00:22:35.168 --> 00:22:38.384
Man was given
freedom, especially,

00:22:38.967 --> 00:22:41.386
The unconscious has
given, the unconscious has

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.315
given, God It is given by
love, which we call Pranav.

00:22:45.032 --> 00:22:50.565
He who is the light of God,
Deliberately gave you freedom.

00:22:52.165 --> 00:22:55.198
If you ever heard my
first lecture, you know,

00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:59.598
How by working in our brain,

00:23:01.432 --> 00:23:04.698
we have been separated
from that conscious power,

00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:08.824
far away from the
infinite that is all around,

00:23:08.848 --> 00:23:12.740
Made us finite, removed
us from the infinite,

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.928
And bound us within
limits, we are separated

00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:16.990
Gone, you are separated,
you are separated;

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:24.640
Why did He do this, because
you are in the hands of a God,

00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:28.926
want to become an
instrument; to organize that

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.537
machine, we leave
it to you to balance it.

00:23:34.521 --> 00:23:40.855
Man, what a big thing he is, in
the whole world, in the whole world,

00:23:42.223 --> 00:23:45.677
All the teachers till
date Have happened, the

00:23:45.701 --> 00:23:49.707
human being standing
today on the earth's surface,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.190
That too in Kalyug,

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:58.456
In every planet, a normal
human being is the highest.

00:24:00.557 --> 00:24:04.890
as much as he can get,
Can't get it even in this world.

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:12.023
A great balance is
needed in your mind,

00:24:12.978 --> 00:24:20.667
There are two bags
named superego and ego,

00:24:21.156 --> 00:24:24.437
There are two screens,
it's ego and super ego.

00:24:24.461 --> 00:24:27.742
It is said that they were
created deliberately,

00:24:28.631 --> 00:24:32.068
On one side one thing
grows, on the other side

00:24:32.092 --> 00:24:36.142
Another thing grows from
it, which comes in between,

00:24:36.586 --> 00:24:40.936
One who comes in balance,
who comes in temperance,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.310
If he does not go to
extremes, he can overcome.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:54.180
The Kundalini rises within him and spreads
It emerges from the middle and nurtures it;

00:24:55.872 --> 00:25:00.739
his mind, excess within him

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:04.400
Sitting on Kundalini,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.435
leaves you in that unconscious,

00:25:12.969 --> 00:25:20.302
As soon as it happens, From above
the unconscious starts flowing in,

00:25:20.458 --> 00:25:23.383
You become one with
the ocean, as if Just like a

00:25:23.407 --> 00:25:26.332
drop is read in the ocean,
it becomes an ocean.

00:25:26.932 --> 00:25:29.590
rising and falling with
the waves of the ocean,

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.354
Asks, hey what are you doing? What
am I doing, I was going and coming..

00:25:33.643 --> 00:25:39.856
Waves are rising from
inside him. its difference

00:25:39.945 --> 00:25:42.882
It becomes completely
quiet, on top of that it

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:46.301
slowly Streams of peace
keep flowing. This is true,

00:25:47.101 --> 00:25:53.480
This is not a random thing, this is the
truth, the great truth that you will find.

00:25:57.236 --> 00:26:03.791
And after getting it, he has to bring
stability, There is no need for you, as you

00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:08.213
are sitting, there is no need for you,
you who Got it right away, got it there

00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:13.879
but some people have a little stability.
It has to be brought, there is no solution.

00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:19.724
The means have been found, the
identity has been found, you reached there,

00:26:19.924 --> 00:26:24.195
And there is a complete
system in place to bring stability.

00:26:26.013 --> 00:26:31.800
As soon as his stability comes, in
supreme peace and supreme joy,

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.537
you attain that witness form which is
described by Shri Krishna when he said,

00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:47.292
about which Jesus Christ had
told, about which it is mentioned

00:26:47.838 --> 00:26:51.882
in all the scriptures, whether
it is written by anyone Jorestrian,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:57.038
whether it is written by Socrates
Yes, said by Confucius,

00:26:57.327 --> 00:27:03.238
Or all the incarnations of Dattatrey ji;
Whatever people have said about it happens.

00:27:04.548 --> 00:27:08.492
Till today these people,
who are of a stature, those

00:27:08.516 --> 00:27:12.460
who were born in high
condition, used to talk

00:27:12.794 --> 00:27:14.545
about themselves,
and understood others. I

00:27:14.569 --> 00:27:16.749
couldn't understand,
what are they talking about;

00:27:17.416 --> 00:27:19.426
He could see things
from the tenth floor While

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.460
these people already
lived on the first floor,

00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:25.038
they don't understand, it
was like, what is going on?

00:27:29.083 --> 00:27:33.171
Sahaja Yoga has
always been there,

00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:35.533
Today you have become a
human being from an animal,

00:27:35.557 --> 00:27:37.482
That too has happened
through Sahaja Yoga only.

00:27:37.749 --> 00:27:41.076
But today in Kalyug,
in the Sahaja Yoga, you

00:27:42.028 --> 00:27:46.699
In that you are limited by the
body become one with the infinite.

00:27:49.521 --> 00:27:54.121
This is that you invited me today and

00:27:54.187 --> 00:28:01.475
honored me,

00:28:06.456 --> 00:28:10.465
What I have to say  in this respect;

00:28:10.465 --> 00:28:15.425
Respect that God who
Standing right at your door.

00:28:16.632 --> 00:28:19.810
This thing happens in a

00:28:19.834 --> 00:28:25.232
moment, and then
the waves of pleasure.

00:28:25.295 --> 00:28:30.472
But many people
have this misconception that by

00:28:30.853 --> 00:28:34.316
doing such things you
will rise from the world, this

00:28:34.361 --> 00:28:37.643
This is not a practical matter,
this is very un-practical talk.

00:28:38.377 --> 00:28:41.487
Mother will tell us that
you would have told the

00:28:41.511 --> 00:28:44.954
truth. Stay forever, and
how will our business run,

00:28:46.463 --> 00:28:49.322
Or something like this, many people say,

00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:53.937
Mother, I am a servant,
how will my job work?

00:28:57.737 --> 00:29:01.015
These questions arise then, these

00:29:01.042 --> 00:29:04.252
questions arise until you have crossed.

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:07.678
As soon as you cross,
you enter the kingdom of

00:29:07.702 --> 00:29:11.597
God. It appears to you
that he is doing everything.

00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:18.538
To give an example, in Sahaja
Yoga any human being He

00:29:18.562 --> 00:29:22.361
cannot die before the age
of seventy if he exceeds it.

00:29:24.959 --> 00:29:28.081
of people who were
said to be of age It will

00:29:28.105 --> 00:29:31.226
end in so many years,
we will die in this year

00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:33.965
Such people also
came to me. and Sahaja

00:29:33.989 --> 00:29:37.182
Yoga The passes are
going quite well so far.

00:29:39.137 --> 00:29:42.686
Recently there was such an incident
that by mistake the news came that our

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:48.282
A Sahaja Yogi, whose age is no He must
have been 40-45 years old when he died;

00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:53.918
And he wrote me a letter Said
impossible cannot be possible.

00:29:55.339 --> 00:29:58.579
Then I came to know from
the vibration that he was alive.

00:29:58.579 --> 00:30:02.112
After that I wrote a letter sitting here
and My London disciples were there

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:04.412
I also asked him to tell
me what is it, he started

00:30:04.436 --> 00:30:06.890
saying No, mother he is alive
because when someone dies

00:30:07.045 --> 00:30:09.759
So a different kind of
vibration comes in the hand.

00:30:12.556 --> 00:30:15.032
So when the letter reached
here, these people found out and

00:30:15.056 --> 00:30:18.004
immediately sent a telegram to
me asking whether it was sent or not.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:27.249
It is impossible. More than this
what experience should I tell you?

00:30:28.649 --> 00:30:34.626
Cancer disease you know, we people
have cured many cancer patients.

00:30:34.715 --> 00:30:36.575
But this is not the
business we do Let me

00:30:36.599 --> 00:30:38.739
tell you first because
as soon as I tell you

00:30:38.739 --> 00:30:41.515
Sir, everyone is suffering
from cancer. come to me

00:30:42.626 --> 00:30:47.719
The same thing happened with Jesus Christ;
21 men were cured by Him, but here our

00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:49.418
one of the disciples
healed 500 people each.

00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:51.379
Have done; A gentleman
just arrived from Rahuri.

00:30:51.379 --> 00:30:55.719
He is the cancer of Rahuri University.
There was a cancer patient, and he cured.

00:30:55.719 --> 00:30:57.920
Yes ! Cancer cannot be cured
except through Sahaja Yoga. Maybe

00:30:57.944 --> 00:31:00.145
I had said this earlier also,
and I am saying it even today.

00:31:01.945 --> 00:31:04.493
And we are also going to
go to the Health Ministry.

00:31:04.517 --> 00:31:06.911
are, but the problem
for us is that as soon as

00:31:06.935 --> 00:31:09.406
We will say that we
cure cancer, all cancers

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.900
We heal the sick, when
did we become doctors?

00:31:12.922 --> 00:31:17.014
We have to help people cross and
The moment they cross, their cancer

00:31:17.038 --> 00:31:21.009
The disease has to be cured.

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:28.344
May you be cured of every kind of disease.
You will look at least 20 years younger

00:31:31.965 --> 00:31:34.877
Because all these things
that you said, Carrying the

00:31:34.901 --> 00:31:38.099
responsibility on their skull,
they are roaming around,

00:31:38.743 --> 00:31:41.160
And keep thinking that I
have to do this, I have to

00:31:41.184 --> 00:31:43.843
do that, all that ends and
everything keeps happening.

00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:47.839
Everything gets
done and gets done.

00:31:48.643 --> 00:31:53.865
It doesn't happen as we want,

00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:56.820
Whatever he wants, happens.

00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:00.264
And whatever he
wants is best for us.

00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:04.842
For an example, I use my own Let
me give you an example from life.

00:32:06.042 --> 00:32:10.531
My husband first, you know, was
Chairman of Shipping Crporation.

00:32:11.042 --> 00:32:15.420
And a big position for him,
the job was offered in England.

00:32:15.908 --> 00:32:20.863
But for some reason there was a political
issue, then his there was no appointment

00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:25.396
And got some lowly job, So
he didn't think it was right to go.

00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:28.672
But I was having fun,
he said something to you I

00:32:28.696 --> 00:32:31.463
don't think I said it would
matter to me, where I am

00:32:32.019 --> 00:32:34.996
It doesn't matter to me
Wala, why are you worried?

00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:40.796
I am very happy and whatever
It happens, so it happens even if.

00:32:41.152 --> 00:32:45.685
One should think like this that in every thing there is some hint from 
God.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.741
I said if you consider the
job such a big thing If we

00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:52.902
understand then there must
be some hint of God in it too.

00:32:53.835 --> 00:32:59.813
the very next year a massive election was
held and 176 countries voted for him and

00:32:59.858 --> 00:33:02.382
He was selected and placed on
such a high position that the man

00:33:02.406 --> 00:33:05.258
whose There is a place he wanted
to go, he went and sat on his skull.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.819
Then he was very
surprised and I said,

00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:14.551
Even if I didn't sit, I
would think that if When

00:33:14.575 --> 00:33:17.657
you have to leave India
and go to a foreign country,

00:33:18.324 --> 00:33:21.023
So people said that mother,
this is your field of work.

00:33:21.047 --> 00:33:23.746
You say that this is India
and this is the land of Yoga.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.190
I said that Yoga is the
land but as many all

00:33:26.214 --> 00:33:28.324
are yogis, they were
born here, what to do?

00:33:29.079 --> 00:33:33.927
The truth is, you'd be surprised

00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:37.634
All the yogis of India these
days were born here only.

00:33:38.546 --> 00:33:42.812
Not here, but
here, I feel like mud.

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:47.701
You excuse me, but laughing.

00:33:48.256 --> 00:33:51.055
If you look at those people
one by one You would

00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:53.878
be surprised how many
great people there were.

00:33:56.744 --> 00:34:01.124
God is such a
big thing for them,

00:34:01.148 --> 00:34:05.529
How much truth and
depth is there in the search.

00:34:07.638 --> 00:34:11.638
Even after offering everything
Want to remain in this every moment.

00:34:12.138 --> 00:34:14.553
Just now a gentleman
came here and that too United

00:34:14.577 --> 00:34:17.289
Nations I have very powerful
officers, meet our people

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:22.866
These people were stunned and said,
teach me teach me the worship of ganpati

00:34:22.891 --> 00:34:25.177
People asked, will you
do Ganpati puja? So

00:34:25.244 --> 00:34:29.869
you are a Christian,
no I am not a Christian,

00:34:29.894 --> 00:34:33.288
I do not belong to any religion, I am a
Sahaja Yogi. I am nothing without Ganpati

00:34:36.463 --> 00:34:39.442
What is worship? Worship
also has to descend

00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:42.863
into the infinite. Talking
about, what is Namaz?

00:34:42.913 --> 00:34:46.510
The mantra to descend into
the infinite is, what is prayer?

00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:50.069
There is an explanation of
descending into the infinite.

00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:56.185
But without permission,

00:34:56.702 --> 00:35:00.777
no connection It
also has no meaning;

00:35:02.027 --> 00:35:06.643
You keep worshiping as much
as you can. do it, it's of no use

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:12.093
Just today a woman came to us, He said,
Mother, I have a lot of heart trouble.

00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:16.236
I said which mantra do you say?
Yes, Mataji started saying Om Shivay!

00:35:16.853 --> 00:35:23.653
Look at the name of Shiva,
Shiva is sitting in the heart itself,

00:35:24.353 --> 00:35:28.201
He has a place in the heart
itself, which made Shiva paliya

00:35:28.225 --> 00:35:31.939
it is impossible for the heart
to move from here to there

00:35:31.939 --> 00:35:34.516
and they are chanting of
Om Namah Shivay;

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.264
She is doing this and her
heart is bad; How is this!

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:47.233
I remember him only once Shiv ji knew that
the heart would become absolutely stable!

00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:51.666
What is the difference
between them and me, same

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.089
The difference is my
connection with Lord Shiva.

00:35:56.449 --> 00:35:59.751
I have taken permission from
them, just like at someone's house.

00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:03.024
if you want to go, you will have
to take permission from him.

00:36:03.057 --> 00:36:06.009
Now you have to go
to Justice Vajde's place.

00:36:06.009 --> 00:36:09.140
If you bang on the door, he will
get you arrested by the police.

00:36:11.232 --> 00:36:14.830
But if you approach them
properly then they will

00:36:14.854 --> 00:36:18.452
also be yours. Will
welcome, say sit, come sit!

00:36:19.017 --> 00:36:22.739
Without connection, all the
worship would have been

00:36:22.763 --> 00:36:26.484
habitual. And that too
when it goes beyond balance,

00:36:26.801 --> 00:36:28.801
He suffers loss.

00:36:29.501 --> 00:36:33.259
You also said in
Hatyoga, towards Hatyogis

00:36:33.259 --> 00:36:35.680
this has been my only
experience of till date.

00:36:35.704 --> 00:36:38.429
 Its a matte of surprise that, Hatyogis
have reached America also!

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:44.423
That all the Hath yogis have
heart trouble, is very surprising;

00:36:45.916 --> 00:36:49.160
Hatha yogis are especially
great worshipers of Shiva. happen,

00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:55.315
The reason for this is that the Hatha Yoga
world Not for people living in Hatha Yoga,

00:36:55.374 --> 00:36:57.982
Those who live in the
forests are for Parshuram,

00:36:58.772 --> 00:37:01.705
It's another thing to
do more or less with

00:37:01.729 --> 00:37:05.022
balance. But Hatha
Yoga is not for you people

00:37:05.454 --> 00:37:10.156
if you overdo it You are
going to have a heart problem.

00:37:11.357 --> 00:37:15.778
Now you are seeing that Hare Rama
Hare Krishna people come into the world;

00:37:17.556 --> 00:37:20.689
I have so many of his
disciples in London.

00:37:20.749 --> 00:37:24.360
They come here suffering from
cancer. I am telling you the truth.

00:37:24.495 --> 00:37:32.451
I am your mother! Whatever is wrong, I must
tell you. They are suffering frm Cancer.

00:37:33.594 --> 00:37:39.728
You will be surprised that Shri
Krishna resides in this throat.

00:37:40.205 --> 00:37:45.298
He is the one who sits here whenever
someone in the throat or cervical (unclear)

00:37:45.322 --> 00:37:47.635
If there is any complaint,
then Shri Krishna

00:37:47.659 --> 00:37:52.039
The name of Radha Krishna
has to be taken. Kundalini calm!

00:37:52.293 --> 00:37:57.572
And see here that their
Kundalini is definitely blocked.

00:37:57.611 --> 00:38:01.013
But here Shri Krishna
was sitting angry What is

00:38:01.037 --> 00:38:04.439
the reason why they have
disappeared from there?

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:08.487
If we think about it, are we
spreading our culture here? However,

00:38:08.511 --> 00:38:11.290
those people do not spread
any culture or unculture in this.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:16.716
I saw their braids falling down, their
dhotis falling down; It sounds so awkward.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.805
But let go the violence of God.

00:38:19.873 --> 00:38:22.361
Those who are biting
and shouting in the name

00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:29.338
On his Vishuddhi Chakra
where Shri Krishna resides

00:38:29.363 --> 00:38:36.627
cancer in that place This is also
the reason for how it happened;

00:38:36.871 --> 00:38:42.182
Otherwise remembering them
even once would be too much.

00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:51.303
What's the need to remember Him so
many times. The whom, we have known!

00:38:51.593 --> 00:38:55.837
just call him once Krishna
Kanhaiya! and He is there !

00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:05.303
" Shankh (Conch shell), Chakra (Sudarshan Chakra), Gada (Arms); and Padma
(Lotus), Garudh (His conveyance) liye padhar". conch shell, mace and Padma Garun!

00:39:05.525 --> 00:39:09.242
What is the need to cause
so much trouble for Him.

00:39:09.266 --> 00:39:13.389
What is the need to
take so much trouble,

00:39:14.912 --> 00:39:19.948
about and so much What is the need to
do so much thinking and doing exhibition.

00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:27.927
In reality He is all the time
seated with in you, but you are stubborn.

00:39:30.233 --> 00:39:37.240
If you believe in God as real, then stay
in surrender, stay in silence, know Him;

00:39:37.332 --> 00:39:40.472
It has to happen inside,

00:39:40.496 --> 00:39:43.572
 after all think about the God
who has created this world,

00:39:43.655 --> 00:39:47.156
who is the one who
created this entire

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:51.535
universe, will He destroy
this entire creation.

00:39:51.868 --> 00:39:55.957
What will He
extinguish it?

00:39:56.068 --> 00:40:02.720
God's love! It is especially
implemented in Kaliyuga.

00:40:05.691 --> 00:40:12.064
Now you already know about the disease.
That we neither have disciples nor many

00:40:12.486 --> 00:40:15.759
Many people's mental
diseases were also cured.

00:40:15.783 --> 00:40:19.566
This is not a special
thing, it is bound to happen;

00:40:19.788 --> 00:40:24.010
To clean the temple of God

00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:26.720
Taking from Bhairon,
Hanuman ji etc. Everyone

00:40:26.744 --> 00:40:29.119
is busy whether
they are there or not

00:40:29.156 --> 00:40:35.304
If you come to this kingdom and see
Stay outside and ask to bring it to us.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.917
So how can we show you
if someone is blind If you

00:40:38.941 --> 00:40:42.487
want to know the colors
then how can you tell them?

00:40:42.587 --> 00:40:46.920
If we want any ant to Explain
our political institutions,

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.950
If we explain our politics
to them then we How

00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:54.953
to explain; you come
into the kingdom of god

00:40:54.978 --> 00:41:01.511
Enter inside it and then you are
absolutely free; nothing to do,

00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:07.198
Man thinks that he can worship God
can buy, it is human intelligence which

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:13.830
thinks of him in a way that i think of
him He believes that I cannot adopt him,

00:41:14.345 --> 00:41:18.615
You will have to be
dedicated to it, you come to this

00:41:18.639 --> 00:41:22.057
kingdom In, by coming into
the kingdom of God's love

00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:26.051
If you have many Sahaja Yogis
here and their experiences If

00:41:26.075 --> 00:41:29.834
you go to write, who knows
how many books will be written.

00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:34.429
But one becomes a
Sahaja Yogi very slowly.

00:41:34.453 --> 00:41:38.981
As the number of ghosts is many.

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:44.230
If someone gives a speech, thousands
of people will become his disciples.

00:41:44.415 --> 00:41:46.300
Because he will put
Mohini mantra in you that

00:41:46.351 --> 00:41:48.571
You will keep listening to
Mohini Vrat, when the speech

00:41:48.595 --> 00:41:50.732
is over If you don't know,
you will lose your mind.

00:41:51.915 --> 00:41:54.522
You will start doing strange
activities, your wives and children.

00:41:54.546 --> 00:41:57.398
They will say that it is not known
how Sadhu ji came to be like this;

00:41:58.135 --> 00:42:00.213
While you will beat your
wife in the morning and

00:42:00.237 --> 00:42:02.271
evening, you will go
and sit with Sadhu Baba.

00:42:03.397 --> 00:42:06.711
He will ask you for money, he
will ask for money and you will rob

00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:09.997
him. Will give. What should I
do with this human intelligence?

00:42:10.022 --> 00:42:12.565
Slowly and gradually one
becomes a Sahaja Yogi;

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:15.131
truth always grows
slowly. It happens slowly;

00:42:15.156 --> 00:42:18.875
If I want to make plastic
flowers then a Thousands

00:42:18.899 --> 00:42:22.617
of flowers can be made
by machine within an hour,

00:42:22.741 --> 00:42:28.507
But if I had real roses It will
definitely take some time to feed.

00:42:28.814 --> 00:42:31.899
Still, this is the
specialty of Kaliyuga

00:42:31.923 --> 00:42:35.564
only. That God's love
has overflowed so much,

00:42:36.057 --> 00:42:42.232
His compassion is flowing so much
that in many births I have tried this,

00:42:42.617 --> 00:42:49.100
Only in the special courtyard
of this birth and this Kaliyuga.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.457
many people cross in a moment

00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:58.082
In all the ordinary, even in
the most ordinary, Krishna also

00:42:58.106 --> 00:43:02.230
In his time we also
worked very hard

00:43:03.518 --> 00:43:10.984
Special to cross Gop Gopis Believe in
the times. No disciple of Christ can cross.

00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:15.701
Tried a lot, worked
very hard, someone Also

00:43:15.725 --> 00:43:19.584
not crossed. You were
also there at that time

00:43:20.024 --> 00:43:25.924
There were some people among you too, the
same people are sitting among you today.

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:31.807
You are not something of today,
you are a seeker of many births,

00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:37.757
When in earlier times you wandered in
the forests, Keep running to the gurus;

00:43:38.456 --> 00:43:41.097
Your life is thousands of
years old and today you make it

00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:44.094
fruitful. If it is meant to happen
and it happens in a moment,

00:43:44.206 --> 00:43:45.966
What is the doubt in that?

00:43:46.655 --> 00:43:51.562
it was promised long ago that
such a time will come in Kalyug only,

00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:55.664
And that's what's happening,
so much of it Why is

00:43:55.688 --> 00:43:59.651
it surprising, why is there
so much doubt in this?

00:43:59.684 --> 00:44:01.751
Why so much controversy?

00:44:01.776 --> 00:44:04.518
Why so much delay?

00:44:07.292 --> 00:44:15.106
By coming to Sahaja Yoga you know
that it is a play of 'Chakras', especially

00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:20.463
You people should know
about Lakshmi ji in India.

00:44:20.487 --> 00:44:23.375
Great care is taken,
not in other countries.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:27.926
In other countries people are
beggars Roam around in the guise of;

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.077
They are fed up, please
by the grace of Goddess

00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:32.227
Lakshmi. Found. Lakshmi
ji is not needed now.

00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:38.049
I just went to Mombasa and those people He
said that Mother Lakshmi ji is very good.

00:44:38.138 --> 00:44:42.049
But now give us peace;
Our wives have gone  crazy.

00:44:42.131 --> 00:44:44.338
There was trouble in our house.

00:44:44.433 --> 00:44:50.600
All the kids gone crazy, mental derailment
Yes, suicide cases are highest here.

00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:54.378
The situation is the same
in America, wherever you go,

00:44:54.402 --> 00:44:58.733
Where there is a lot of money
there are more mad people.

00:45:00.899 --> 00:45:06.010
But Lakshmi in Sahaja Yoga
Ji's blessings also shower,

00:45:06.424 --> 00:45:11.407
It also gets balanced,

00:45:11.787 --> 00:45:17.504
That also gets balanced,
you go to that kingdom.

00:45:17.932 --> 00:45:24.986
Let's descend into that special blessing,
which keeps making all the work such that

00:45:26.278 --> 00:45:30.717
your entire path will
be easy and simple.

00:45:33.384 --> 00:45:36.065
We have many people
here who will give

00:45:36.089 --> 00:45:39.717
martyrdom, will give
witness, will give evidence.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.835
Now Mother is there, she gives temptation
of everything

00:45:43.859 --> 00:45:46.694
to the child, that the son
should eat like this, not this,

00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:49.851
then I will give that to you,
you will eat this as soon as

00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:52.896
possible. I will give you two
paisa, if you eat it brother,

00:45:53.358 --> 00:45:56.920
then if you don't agree to
that also, then I will say ok to

00:45:56.944 --> 00:46:00.938
you. I will build a palace for
you to eat; Such is my condition!

00:46:00.963 --> 00:46:08.688
I keep celebrating in every way and
also give everything. Yes, I also give a

00:46:09.043 --> 00:46:13.097
lot of love, mother only gives it.
Mother says, son! Know yourself, tap into

00:46:13.121 --> 00:46:17.174
the power that is within you, ask for
what is real, ask for what is real, this

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:24.658
innocence No matter how much joy
you have, no wonder, no matter how much

00:46:24.724 --> 00:46:31.362
wealth you have, no matter how much
You may have power, no matter how high a

00:46:31.425 --> 00:46:39.182
position you hold, be it a queen or a
king, there is no joy. Can't come, can't

00:46:39.449 --> 00:46:42.126
get, unless you
stand in the kingdom of

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.309
bliss and when we
stand in the kingdom of joy

00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:50.627
then you are kings and
queens in every situation!

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:56.860
No one can buy you, you No
one can win, you are winning.

00:46:58.658 --> 00:47:00.835
He is the king!

00:47:00.968 --> 00:47:03.703
There are kings, we
have such great kings here.

00:47:03.847 --> 00:47:11.581
He has become one of the
kings in his country; Here in this

00:47:11.735 --> 00:47:16.005
Maharashtra, there have
been a very big personality, who

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:25.717
lives in a small village of Shirdi,
she was a king, people know the king.

00:47:25.873 --> 00:47:31.447
Didn't know what the kingship was like? How joyous they have been living.

00:47:31.492 --> 00:47:36.127
<i>In ou Bharatvarsh Guru Nanak,
was like another, the second King.

00:47:36.152 --> 00:47:39.771
like Kabir, the third,
happened to be like a king,.

00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:46.152
Did they enjoy some rulership, today
the entire world bows at their feet,

00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:50.463
To make you understand all of them ,
to complete their work and

00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:54.241
only to prove whatever they have

00:47:54.284 --> 00:47:56.827
talked about, whatever he
has said. That's why I have

00:47:56.852 --> 00:48:02.307
come before you. None of
his words were a lie, whatever

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:10.060
Jesus said, whatever Krishna
said, which is in the Geeta,

00:48:10.282 --> 00:48:12.459
which is in the Vedas, which

00:48:12.524 --> 00:48:15.415
is in the Bible, which is in the Quran;

00:48:15.482 --> 00:48:18.637
all the things
I want to prove it to you.

00:48:19.171 --> 00:48:23.570
I may appear to be very simple, but

00:48:23.726 --> 00:48:29.526
the power within me
can prove to you that

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:36.808
What is unconscious, what is
conscious, How does it work?

00:48:38.118 --> 00:48:44.119
When you are crossed, every
single place on every single finger

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.942
has your chakra, it tells you,
look, here there is a problem,

00:48:48.208 --> 00:48:52.030
here they have a complaint on
their fingers, believe it, he does

00:48:52.185 --> 00:48:56.563
not tell you in words, you
Tells by burning, tells by cooling

00:48:57.318 --> 00:49:00.995
As if cool waves
started filling inside you

00:49:00.995 --> 00:49:03.290
That's coming as
blessings, cold cold as if

00:49:03.314 --> 00:49:05.984
there were streams running
through the Himalayas.

00:49:12.793 --> 00:49:16.552
This is subjective
knowledge, consider it as

00:49:16.576 --> 00:49:20.334
the knowledge of the
doer. Yes, you become

00:49:20.359 --> 00:49:28.179
a doer, the knowledge of doing comes within
you; You become who you are, There is no

00:49:28.393 --> 00:49:30.654
need to study outside,
there is no need to look

00:49:30.678 --> 00:49:32.890
in books, everything
is here in the library.

00:49:33.434 --> 00:49:36.407
Some great scholars come
before me and say, Mother

00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:39.831
Yes, you are talking about
what is in Niranjan Samhita;

00:49:39.856 --> 00:49:42.478
I said brother, leave the
code, I never did. Never

00:49:42.502 --> 00:49:45.124
even read the Upanishads,
never even read the Geeta;

00:49:48.142 --> 00:49:51.953
Then how to know this,
because from where it is known So

00:49:51.977 --> 00:49:55.787
it's all inside, it's all
sitting in your mind, isn't it?

00:49:56.254 --> 00:50:00.898
If you have a library inside you
Search and read whatever you want.

00:50:02.698 --> 00:50:09.809
You become completely meditative
and then whatever you speak is the truth.

00:50:10.565 --> 00:50:13.253
You become completely Satyameva!

00:50:13.676 --> 00:50:17.320
Whatever you say, you prove it,

00:50:20.942 --> 00:50:24.420
Kundalini will rise
from your hand like this.

00:50:24.707 --> 00:50:29.887
Leave this matter about
me, here there are many

00:50:29.887 --> 00:50:32.931
people present here
who look like you, just on their

00:50:32.956 --> 00:50:36.731
gestures but the Kundalini
rises, thousands rise.

00:50:39.667 --> 00:50:44.790
Don't do blind faith,
you should know this.

00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:48.417
In London, I was very surprised

00:50:49.247 --> 00:50:54.100
that a gentleman transcended six seekers.

00:50:54.183 --> 00:50:56.536
they were just sitting
with their hand towards my

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.912
photo, got realized and
attained their positions.

00:51:00.662 --> 00:51:04.449
I was very surprised,
when I saw it, I said hahhah,

00:51:04.532 --> 00:51:08.616
where are these great men of
ancient times?

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:11.831
I must touch their feet 
and take them to my heart,

00:51:11.887 --> 00:51:13.689
where should I keep them?

00:51:13.975 --> 00:51:20.811
They transcended just at the sight of the
photo, otherwise too they were realized.

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:24.402
the second biggest
blessing in the world,

00:51:24.426 --> 00:51:28.256
that's happening, you
may not be aware of it;

00:51:30.256 --> 00:51:33.263
Many young children
under eight years of age

00:51:33.287 --> 00:51:36.646
Below, I even saw some
of the twelve year olds,

00:51:37.256 --> 00:51:42.544
There are many in America too, there
are many in London and they are here too,

00:51:43.611 --> 00:51:46.056
Great creatures have been born, all in

00:51:46.144 --> 00:51:48.722
Kundalini Shastra.
is proficient; Just

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.312
today a small five year old boy was beating

00:51:51.411 --> 00:51:54.188
his own father; he was being beaten

00:51:54.306 --> 00:51:59.166
on his navel chakra and his
agya chakra was being beaten.

00:52:00.335 --> 00:52:03.529
He was thinking that he was
holding this thing. She is there, that

00:52:04.164 --> 00:52:07.507
thing of hers is catching. He didn't
have to tell anything, he was going just beating.

00:52:07.683 --> 00:52:13.218
He spared only after he got him 
freed after hitting two or four times.

00:52:14.107 --> 00:52:17.840
True knowledge!

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.817
Each of their hand gestures, each
of their behaviour, all full of knowledge

00:52:23.906 --> 00:52:28.951
of each and every thing. We
also have a grand daughter.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:33.106
Both grand daughters are very great. Both of them are born like this,

00:52:33.904 --> 00:52:35.513
when we went to the
airport, you I started

00:52:35.537 --> 00:52:37.344
moving my hands and
said, what are you doing?

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:41.501
Nanny! tying everyone,
there are so many black

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:45.504
people here, black means
what you call negative.

00:52:47.598 --> 00:52:51.145
They are tying everyone, she
was so small, three years old

00:52:51.169 --> 00:52:54.654
So she started telling me
to tell the Sahaja Yogis that

00:52:54.975 --> 00:52:58.542
Look, our heart is
on the horse, on the

00:52:58.566 --> 00:53:02.886
horse. Sit but don't
let the horse sit on you

00:53:03.397 --> 00:53:06.041
And always sit on the
white horse, Kaliyuga It is

00:53:06.065 --> 00:53:08.708
said that there will be
a ride on a white horse

00:53:10.869 --> 00:53:13.908
Small child under
three years of age;

00:53:14.019 --> 00:53:16.997
We have seen many such children

00:53:17.386 --> 00:53:19.597
Which even in today's
India, I would say Well,

00:53:19.621 --> 00:53:21.832
I have seen at least
three hundred children.

00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:26.233
Because no matter how
extreme Kalyug it may

00:53:26.257 --> 00:53:29.222
be, these people will
take birth in Kaliyuga.

00:53:29.286 --> 00:53:35.333
 They have come and apart from
this demons are also being born,

00:53:35.998 --> 00:53:39.110
Otherwise how will
Kaliyuga continue?

00:53:39.268 --> 00:53:41.943
And many animals
are also being born,

00:53:41.967 --> 00:53:45.464
Ordinary people hesitate
a bit in taking birth

00:53:45.505 --> 00:53:49.000
Because they know that
the situation is very bad.

00:53:49.445 --> 00:53:54.020
So many animals are also being born
here Their population is also very high.

00:53:55.711 --> 00:54:03.578
The day Satyayuga arrives, this 
number will decrease automatically.

00:54:04.822 --> 00:54:08.163
An ordinary human
being will be born,

00:54:09.278 --> 00:54:12.109
Because whoever sees
it that this noise Baba, the

00:54:12.133 --> 00:54:15.378
situation is such that why
should one assume the body?

00:54:15.756 --> 00:54:21.245
Why go in this trouble where father
Father is no more, sister is no more;

00:54:21.912 --> 00:54:26.178
Who would want to get
themselves into such trouble?

00:54:26.778 --> 00:54:31.934
Such great personalities
are being born,

00:54:32.534 --> 00:54:37.178
But along with them other
powers will also be born.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:43.277
In your Bharatvarsh sixteen demons
are born, if there is one then cross it,

00:54:44.233 --> 00:54:46.277
Now there can be no
talk of extermination

00:54:46.435 --> 00:54:50.277
Because kill them, there is
a sir among them died from,

00:54:50.504 --> 00:54:54.766
So he became a
ghost and disappeared,

00:54:55.132 --> 00:54:59.327
Where did so many evil
tendencies come from in the world?

00:54:59.351 --> 00:55:03.354
What is its source?
What is its source?

00:55:05.482 --> 00:55:12.390
How will you guys understand this?
How will you guys give its solution?

00:55:12.926 --> 00:55:16.593
Scientists please tell
us how this is happening

00:55:16.815 --> 00:55:20.103
can tell from science

00:55:20.326 --> 00:55:23.747
The condition of
scientists is such that many

00:55:23.771 --> 00:55:27.192
people in America start
smoking ganja and this

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:31.073
So five scientists
Committee formed, its address

00:55:31.098 --> 00:55:34.310
guess what happens if
you smoke ganja vanja

00:55:34.495 --> 00:55:38.186
When they went to
find out, these ghosts sat

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.821
down and these people
started smoking ganja.

00:55:41.924 --> 00:55:48.117
They all resigned their jobs, and all are consuming ganja

00:55:51.526 --> 00:55:55.181
If he was such a great
scientist then why marijuana?

00:55:55.205 --> 00:55:58.859
Started drinking, why do
you drink so much alcohol?

00:56:02.038 --> 00:56:06.904
Muhammad Saheb told not to drink alcohol
Yes, Nanak Saheb told not to drink alcohol;

00:56:07.162 --> 00:56:10.732
Science can be demonstrated
by doing it. If these people

00:56:10.756 --> 00:56:14.326
can prove it, then we will
be ready to accept science.

00:56:17.393 --> 00:56:22.596
Are these people happy?
You people are very happy.

00:56:23.855 --> 00:56:26.810
But those people who
studied science He has

00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:29.788
made so much progress
but is in great sorrow.

00:56:30.233 --> 00:56:35.388
One in front of the United Nations
It's a big question, you know?

00:56:35.521 --> 00:56:39.099
that the developing
countries which are growing

00:56:39.124 --> 00:56:44.187
trap them in this trap No,
in which we are trapped;

00:56:45.526 --> 00:56:48.834
People especially gave
this report about Nepal

00:56:48.858 --> 00:56:52.165
That the people here
are poor but very happy

00:56:52.432 --> 00:56:56.254
They are very happy, why
are you destroying them?

00:57:05.234 --> 00:57:11.900
Many people also see you and
say That Indians are still very active.

00:57:13.877 --> 00:57:21.122
Even now, I have not reached
such a level of sadness,

00:57:21.166 --> 00:57:24.053
Why are you guys developing
them and going through

00:57:24.077 --> 00:57:27.318
this process? You are
trapped in which we are trapped.

00:57:30.522 --> 00:57:36.699
Then you have to think, should
we can we shortcut, can we

00:57:36.754 --> 00:57:42.010
This progress somehow We can
make it smaller, we can definitely do it,

00:57:45.455 --> 00:57:48.102
Because you have
the right to it. You To

00:57:48.126 --> 00:57:51.455
nurture the infinite,
which is a difficult task;

00:57:51.988 --> 00:57:55.988
Which is hard work,
which is all work,

00:57:56.230 --> 00:58:03.541
You know everything that is Get
it, at the same center point you get..

00:58:05.452 --> 00:58:12.119
Sahaja Yoga God's
invention of love.

00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:16.991
Till today you people have worshiped
God The love did not have to go, because

00:58:17.022 --> 00:58:20.614
You don't have a connection,
But only if there is a connection

00:58:20.896 --> 00:58:27.925
those who are inside this hall Those who
are sitting will not listen to my speech.

00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:37.391
in the same way as God
Will come into the empire of,

00:58:37.702 --> 00:58:42.231
that is his omnipresent form

00:58:43.568 --> 00:58:47.863
resides in every particle The
thing that happened is called,

00:58:47.887 --> 00:58:55.114
You will know all his
rules; there will be no doubt

00:58:55.692 --> 00:59:01.936
what a wonder,
what a miracle Is;

00:59:04.535 --> 00:59:09.535
Otherwise just like
Churchill in London

00:59:10.779 --> 00:59:13.601
What does Churchill do
again; Selling as it was bought.

00:59:13.868 --> 00:59:15.935
..unless there is some life thing
Will not be visible in the world, Lord

00:59:16.157 --> 00:59:18.690
Aaj Tak are being sold in India.

00:59:21.112 --> 00:59:24.817
Until a living thing
appeared in the world

00:59:24.841 --> 00:59:29.090
Will give, even the name
of God cannot remain.

00:59:29.534 --> 00:59:35.423
Because God is
alive, only you find him,

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:40.031
Because you guys are on
the stage, it's through you It's

00:59:40.055 --> 00:59:43.882
going to happen, it's going
to happen because of you

00:59:44.015 --> 00:59:48.603
