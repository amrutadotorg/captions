00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.892
Interviewer: Shri Mataji, can we start at the very beginning, ‘what is the need to achieve self-realization?’

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.892
Shri Mataji: If you see the problems of this world today, you can easily find out 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:32.892
that most of them are because of some sort of a problem which is existing among human beings. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.892
Some are aware of it, and some are not. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.892
You take the physical, you take the mental, spiritual, social, political, religious. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.892
So, that shows one thing that we have not yet known the Absolute Truth. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.892
We have Unclear (know, no) yet that light in which we can see the Absolute Truth. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.892
And if there is a method by which you can advance in your evolutionary process, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.892
and have a break through into reality then these problems can be solved. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.892
And that’s why self-realization is eminent for us and is already planned by the Divine. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.892
Interviewer: So, what kind of system, what kind of subtle system do we have that enables us to achieve the self-realization?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.892
Shri Mataji: There is a system within us which we can call as the mechanism 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.892
which achieve this happening through a connecting chord 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.892
or the premule of our seed which we call as Kundalini. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:25.892
So, the Truth is that we are not this body, this mind, this social life that we lead or the ego 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.892
that we have or the conditionings but we are the pure Spirit. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.892
And another truth is that there is a all-pervading power of Divine love 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.892
which does all the living works. Who runs our heart? 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.892
They might say: its autonomous nervous system. But who is this auto? 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.892
All these questions are there. And we need something more in our awareness 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.892
to understand what is all this. Why are we on this Earth. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.892
And this subtle system is already there existing with in us 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.892
and this power of Kundalini which is three and half coils in our sacrum bone 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.892
‘imagine it was called sacrum by Greeks means they knew it was a sacred bone’ 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.892
which passes through six centers which are energy centers within our spinal chord and brain 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:04.892
and connects us to this all-pervading power to the subtle energy that does all the living work. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.892
Interviewer: Then what is the difference between the Sahaja Yoga and all these other yogas that are in the market place?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.892
Shri Mataji: See, Sahaja: Saha means with you, ja is born. That means spontaneous. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.892
Spontaneous Yoga. That means it’s a living process. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.892
But all other yogas are included in it. like if you have a car and when you ignite it, 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.892
all the machinery starts working. In the same way, 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.892
the machinery within starts working as soon as the Kundalini is awakened. Alright? 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.892
Now, this machinery when it starts working, it is called as Raja Yoga. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:18.892
But normally people of Raja Yoga what they do, that they try, they try to use the machinery as if it is outside. 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.892
Like your car has not started, you start moving the wheels. No use. It’s like that. 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.892
They do bandhas that means they try to muscular closing of the chakras they try. 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.892
Because when the Kundalini raises these chakras close. No doubt. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.892
Because they allow the Kundalini to move up and then close. So that it doesn’t fall down. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.892
But these people do it artificially. What’s the use? There is no Kundalini also they do Khechari. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.892
Some people who are having a self-realization organization in America, now it’s finished I think, 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.892
they used to cut this thread under the tongue and take the tongue backwards 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.892
saying that this is Khechari. Actually, what happens, when the Kundalini raises 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.892
then this tongue automatically is pulled inside. Because it is closed you see, 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.892
this center is closed. So, automatically it is pulled inside. 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.892
But these people do it artificially and I have seen some people 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.892
who had their tongues hanging like wagging just like a dog’s tongue. 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.892
They can’t speak, they can’t eat. But they did it all in seeking. 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.892
And two were doctors from India. They never came back to India. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.892
So, this is what it is that, to do something artificially, is can never achieve the yoga. 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.892
It has to be spontaneous. Then Hath yoga is where people do asanas and things. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:10.892
There are eight angas means eight facets of this Hath yoga of Patanjali. 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.892
Out of which one is Yama-Niyama. Out of which Unclear () are these asanas. 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.892
We too use asanas sometimes if there is any physical problem. 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.892
But first we allow the Kundalini to raise so we know where is the problem. 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.892
And if it requires any physical exercise then we tell them ‘alright, you need to do physical exercise’. 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.892
It’s just science. It’s not just everybody to do all kinds of asanas and what happens 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.892
if Unclear () the people are thin down with the terrible exercises. 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.892
They thin down and they think that they are very healthy but such people get liver trouble, 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.892
they get heart trouble, asthma all kinds of things. 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.892
So, indiscriminate use of these things is wrong. 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.892
After realization then you should do it because you know what is your problem. 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.892
Otherwise without knowing your problem, you are just trying these things is not very good. 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.892
But actually, Patanjali himself has written what happens after realization 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.892
that you develop thoughtless awareness, doubtless awareness. 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.892
Even yoga has written about it. So, it shows that they have written about it, 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.892
they may not have talked about Kundalini and all that. 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.892
But they have written that these are the stages one has to pass through. 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.892
This is the most part of Patanjali’s book. Most of it. 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.892
A little bit is there about Yama-Niyama. What you should do, 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.892
what you should not eat, what you should eat.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.892
Interviewer: Another question along the same line Shri Mataji, why are they so many problems between religions?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.892
Shri Mataji: Same thing. They have not yet got their self-realizations. 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.892
They haven’t got their reality. They don’t know what reality is. They are like blind people. 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.892
Blind people always thinks that they are the best you see. They can’t see and others are all fools. 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.892
So, when they start preaching something blind to the blind where will they go? 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.892
So, they have to have their realization which everybody has said. Christ has said it,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.892
Buddha has said it, Maha Veera has said it, Krishna has said it, Rama has said it. 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.892
Every body has said that you have to have self-realization. But nobody does this. 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.892
Most of the religions are power oriented. They are fighting for a power or a land. 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.892
Or for some mosque or something. Or if not that they are money oriented. And it could be both or. 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.892
So, these are not religions because they are not spirit oriented. 

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:11.892
I always say that this way of flower born on the tree of life and then everybody plucks the flowers 

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.892
and carry those flowers with them which were dead and start proclaiming them saying that

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.892
these are our flowers, these are my flowers and all. And now they are with dead flowers. 

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.892
So, that decaying and people are finding it out. 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.892
That’s why now people are become now very negligent about their religion and they don’t bother. 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.892
Interviewer: How does self-realization help to establish peace within oneself?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.892
Shri Mataji: Of course, it does. You see all these things are in thoughts. 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:02.892
All the religions are nothing but mere thoughts now. These are only mental processes. 

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.892
It has nothing to do with reality. 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.892
So, the thought starts and falls off and another thought starts and falls off. 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.892
They either come from the past or from the future. 

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.892
Or you can say from the conditionings and from the ego. So, you are never in the present. 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.892
That means you are never in the reality. 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.892
But when this happens is Kundalini raises then these thoughts are elongated. 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.892
In between these thoughts there is reality – the present. Where you don’t think. 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.892
And you establish that state which we call as thoughtless awareness. 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.892
By this happening and you are at peace with yourself. 

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.892
I have known people who have got peace of wars this thing, they were very hot-tempered people. 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.892
Very very hot tempered. So, how can they spread peace 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.892
when they are not peace within their selves? So, from that angel, 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.892
one has to say that you have to have self-realization for your own self to be peaceful 

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.892
and to emit peace through you. 

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.892
Interviewer: What advantages physically do we get from self-realization?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.892
Shri Mataji: Physical being is very much helped. 

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.892
I have seen people getting cured during just awakening and many have been cured. 

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.892
There are four doctors now, we should say who have got their M.D. in Sahaja Yoga 

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.892
for they were cure of diseases which were in curable. 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.892
Then we have also a method by which you can feel yourself. 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.892
What are your problems physical are. And problems of others. 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.892
Because you develop a personality which we call as a collective conscious personality. 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.892
And in that you can feel what’s wrong with another person, what’s wrong with you, 

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.892
this is a self-knowledge about your health everything. 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.892
And if you can connect these centers which are energy of Unclear () you are cured. 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.892
You can cure others also. So, it does help. It’s your own power that helps you. 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.892
You don’t have to also go to these horrible places where they have to discover what’s wrong with you. 

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.892
You just discover it on your fingertips. And if you know how to cure it, 

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.892
you can cure yourself and you can cure others also. 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.892
We have to know this knowledge you have to have what is to be done, 

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.892
how to be alright with Sahaja Yoga. 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.892
You see, you don’t have to be all of them military like same size people, 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.892
God has created every leaf different from another leaf and that brings variety 

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.892
and personality and one should respect the body. 

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.892
One should not go on trying to become like some cinema actor or actress 

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.892
but you have to be yourself whatever you are. 

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.892
And mostly the body is built up according to the need of a person. 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.892
Now for example, to protect my centers, I have to be little fat. Otherwise, if I thin down, 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.892
I don’t know what will happen to my centers. 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.892
So, I have to be fat. I accept it that if I have fat, is alright. 

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.892
Interviewer: Then it would seem that through self-knowledge, 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.892
we are also reaching new dimensions. What are these new dimensions? 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.892
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what we do. With self-knowledge, 

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.892
you really know yourself first of all what’s problem with you. 

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.892
Then you know others. Then you know the reality. 

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.892
And the reality is very simple to understand that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God 

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.892
and enjoy yourself. What more do you want. And you don’t have to pay for it 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.892
because it’s a living process. Very simple thing. 

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.892
When you are in a filthy pond, 

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.892
facing all kinds of worms and things, to you that pond becomes the reality. 

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:36.892
But the lotuses that come out with their fragrance, for them, their new life is reality. 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.892
That’s the heaven for them. And they are not bothered as to what surrounds them. 

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.892
But here is more. You are bothered, and you try to elevate others also. 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.892
And then you realize how great is your own being. How glorified it is. 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.892
And you start respecting yourself and utilizing it for the benefit of others.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.892
Interviewer: Self-realization would appear to be a very powerful thing. 

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.892
Does one develop new powers?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.892
Shri Mataji: Of course, it gives lots of powers. 

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.892
Firstly, it gives you the power of collective consciousness. 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.892
By which you know the problems of others. Within yourself you are peaceful, 

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.892
and you are very kind and compassionate and at the same time you are very dynamic. 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.892
Supposing you have some talent which is not yet expressed well suddenly he starts expressing. 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.892
I have seen people who are like charted accountants becoming great poets. 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.892
Musicians suddenly become world famous. Because whatever power they had, 

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.892
their talent had now been enlightened. We use a very little of it 

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.892
but with this you are so confident of yourself and so compassionate at the same time. 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.892
That it works and it has worked with so many people even artists 

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.892
and also dancers everybody has seen the beauty of their own potential. 

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.892
That’s what happens to many people. 

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.892
Interviewer: And to ask the age-old question to Unclear (to paraphrase) conscious pilot, 

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.892
what is Truth? How do we achieve it?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.892
Shri Mataji: That’s what I told you through out, the Truth is that you are the Spirit. 

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.892
And the another is there is an all-pervading power. 

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.892
And through Kundalini awakening you have to have connection with this all-pervading power, 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.892
so your Spirit starts shining in your being, in your life.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.892
Interviewer: And another fundamental question Shri Mataji what is pure Divine Love?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.892
Shri Mataji: No no but at mental level what will you understand? 

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.892
See, your mental level is limited, you have to go beyond it. 

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.892
Then you know the Truth is that you are the Spirit. 

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.892
And because the manifestation of the Spirit starts. 

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.892
Pure Divine Love is the energy, is a subtle energy which does all the creation, 

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.892
all the sustenance and all the redemption. 

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.892
So, in this redemption process now we have become human beings. 

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.892
Now the same power which is reflected in us as Kundalini works out the last bit 

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.892
where we become connected to this all-pervading power. 

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:05.892
So, this pure love as I am talking about is a very subtle energy is the ocean of real knowledge. 

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.892
Is the ocean of compassion, blessings. And above all, it is dynamism. 

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:24.892
So, this energy understands things, co-ordinates, co-operates above all it loves. 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.892
But its love is not like human love where you get entangled with your child 

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.892
or with your wife or with something. Actually this, 

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:47.892
this beautiful energy is very delicately handling human beings. 

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.892
And it raises like a sap in the tree. 

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.892
Which gives energy to all the parts of the tree and then it evaporates or else it goes back. 

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.892
Its not attached to anything. But when you are attached to someone, then what happens, 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.892
that loved eyes (die) as a result you get stagnated like the sap. 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.892
Supposing it’s attached to one flower, the tree will die and ultimately also the flower will die. 

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:42.892
So, it’s a process of complete detached movement of this energy of Divine Love. 

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.892
Interviewer: So, human love really is very selfish. 

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.892
Shri Mataji: Yes. Because you see, not I would say selfish always but it’s always limited. 

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.892
Because this mental capacity also apart from mental capacity, 

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:08.892
there is emotional capacity which are all limited in human beings. But this one is not limited. 

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.892
Interviewer: And on a much more mundane level you have an enormous organization 

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.892
that operates right throughout the world. How is it done without money?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.892
Shri Mataji: Its organization which is spontaneously built 

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.892
and it’s a living organism like our bodies you see. 

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:53.892
And it exists through co-operation, co-ordination, understanding very innate feelings of oneness. 

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.892
This is the reason why we don’t have to spend much money. 

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.892
Of course, we don’t spend any money for self-realization which is a living process.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.892
Also, we don’t spend really much money 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.892
otherwise also which you would require to organize something or to do something. 

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.892
Because such a spontaneous happening. 

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:27.892
But we need some time some money say for may be organizing a program in a city I think, 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.892
we find it so easy with so many people with little money we can do a lot. 

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.892
And also, there are blessings and we get so many times things so cheaper, 

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:45.892
so much better with little payment. Firstly, Shri Mataji as you called me, 

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.892
I would say in the beginning I just was so concerned how to spread Sahaja Yoga 

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.892
that I would travel myself on my own account. And even I have booked halls on my account. 

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.892
But now everybody said that it is not proper that you should pay for our salvation also. 

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.892
So, they collect some money but the amount is so little that every body’s purse is not much dust. 

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.892
And those can afford to pay only pay very little amount of money. 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.892
Interviewer: And I have heard that many Sahaja Yogis say that if you help with your own money, 

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.892
if you help finance God’s work, it also helps you financially.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.892
Shri Mataji: That’s what they think. They have experienced like that. 

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.892
That’s why they believe that those who have generously help for Sahaja Yoga 

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.892
have been looked after in every way. That is their experience. 

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.892
Interviewer: Yes, it seems to be yes. It’s a natural Unclear ()

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.892
Shri Mataji: Yeah. This is the Kindness of the Divine you see. 

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.892
Also, those who tried to harm us I am told that harmed which I don’t want to do any harm to them 

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.892
but something happens to them like a Divine punishment may be. 

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.892
Not of a severe type but it does something to them, 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.892
that makes them understand that they have done wrong to us. 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.892
We only forgive. We don’t do anything to them. 

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.892
Interviewer: And one final question Shri Mataji, do you see a begin Unclear () in Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.892
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what I have seen now. Suddenly, last year it started to galloping very fast 

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.892
and, in every country, it has gone up little ways 

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.892
Interviewer: So, by the end of the century we should have many thousands of Sahaja Yogis. 

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.892
Shri Mataji: Yes. We will. No doubt about it. 

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.892
Practically most of them who are to be emancipated we find many. 

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.892
Interviewer: That is an interesting thing you say, is there is a certain number of Sahaja Yogis potential?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.892
Shri Mataji: Still, they are. Quite a lot. But I think some will be judged as no good. 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.892
May be. Because I have seen such people myself. 

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.892
Interviewer: Thank you very much.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.892
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.000
