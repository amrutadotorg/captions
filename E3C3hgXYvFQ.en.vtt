00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:34.514
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:47.715
As it is, today, a question has been put forward before Me

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:55.242
that why our attention gets lost; in the modern times,

00:00:55.443 --> 00:01:00.015
why our attention is not towards God.

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:01.812
And that, in modern times,

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:09.680
why a human being has gone down in his quality of humanity.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:15.739
These questions point out to one single fact

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.940
that our attention has been challenged by modern times.

00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:42.915
This attention has been challenged

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:46.430
by all that we call modern today.

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:52.880
I do not say that we have to be primitive people.

00:01:53.081 --> 00:02:02.160
In this great country of ours, India, which was Bharatvarsh,

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.525
we had such a great quality of humanity,

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:12.486
such a great quality of administration,

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:20.340
quality of kings, queens; all that was not a myth.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:26.160
It was a fact that we had Rama, Krishna

00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:33.345
the benevolent king and a great diplomat of the divine force.

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:39.533
But today we find all these things sound like mythical

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:45.070
because at what level we are, we see that as the truth,

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.945
as the reality - but it is not.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:54.050
All this is created by human beings.

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:59.155
How this is created, and why it has happened,

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.754
I would like to explain to you.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:10.642
When our attention was created before, in a way

00:03:10.843 --> 00:03:16.897
that we were living with very few things in this country,

00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:26.862
everyone knew that you have to have your self-realization.

00:03:27.063 --> 00:03:29.696
Nobody bothered their heads about

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:34.416
how much wealth you are going to acquire,
how many things we are going to have,

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:38.917
except for the kings who acquired wealth

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:43.084
for the betterment of the society and also

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:48.972
who acquired the power for the protection of the society.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.125
Then we became slaves of two cultures

00:03:55.326 --> 00:04:00.427
One the Islamic, another the British culture,

00:04:00.628 --> 00:04:02.028
the English culture.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:04.753
And I think the real downfall came

00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:07.901
when this English culture came upon us.

00:04:08.144 --> 00:04:11.518
Because, though they were Muslims they believed in God.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.127
Whatever wrong they did,

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.831
they did it in the name of God and they believed it.

00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:20.435
But the attention was not, still, in acquiring things.

00:04:20.636 --> 00:04:23.307
We say that Aurangazeb was a very bad king, no doubt.

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:27.101
He killed so many Hindus because he believed

00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:29.916
that Islam is the only religion.

00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:32.085
That was his stupidity I should say.

00:04:32.286 --> 00:04:34.957
He was ignorant; he was so violent.

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.991
But he himself was an extremely frugal person.

00:04:41.192 --> 00:04:43.157
He used to make his own caps,

00:04:43.358 --> 00:04:45.490
sell them in the market and live on that.

00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:51.490
And he would not touch any money of the public.

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.168
But then the English, when they started ruling in this country,

00:04:56.427 --> 00:04:59.007
this language English came upon us

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:03.552
as not a blessing but a curse, I think.

00:05:03.753 --> 00:05:10.050
Because the whole literature is full with ideas

00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:14.680
which are contrary to the culture of God,

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.105
contrary to the culture of Christ.

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:21.655
They believed that Christ was born in England.

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:25.466
Many Christians still believe that you become a sahab

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.606
when you become Christians.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:33.482
This culture of the English which was forced on us,

00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:35.785
this language which was forced on us,

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:42.170
gave us a absolutely a different direction

00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:45.152
which we should not have accepted.

00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:49.480
But as it is, we were three hundred years already in the slavery,

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.332
people had to accept it blindfolded.

00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.936
Shri Krishna has clearly said

00:05:57.137 --> 00:06:01.744
that the awareness grows downward

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:08.121
while the roots are in the brain of a person;

00:06:08.322 --> 00:06:13.800
and the awareness, which is growing downwards,

00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:19.765
forms the tree. And this western culture is the one,

00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:24.083
which makes you grow downwards towards materialism;

00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:28.714
whether it is communism or it is socialism or democracy

00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:30.331
that makes no difference.

00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:38.016
The whole thing is that you have to attend to the material side.

00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:43.792
So the first object of the western culture

00:06:43.993 --> 00:06:49.164
or the western science was, first to capture the matter,

00:06:49.391 --> 00:06:51.524
the five elements in such a way

00:06:51.751 --> 00:06:54.351
that it can be used for the comfort of human beings,

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:59.125
for the physical comfort of human beings.

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:03.656
But as the culture is just to move forward

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:06.560
without any control over yourself,

00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:09.846
like a kite flying in the air

00:07:10.073 --> 00:07:15.318
without having any control of a finger on it,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:19.446
the whole thing drifted into various

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:27.065
directions and various fields, where it got lost.

00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:33.633
When we pay attention to something, if the attention is pure,

00:07:33.842 --> 00:07:41.150
it will purify the matter and will come back to us as a pure attention.

00:07:41.392 --> 00:07:44.376
But when the attention is filled with these ideas

00:07:44.572 --> 00:07:49.349
that you have to use all the matter for your comfort,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.987
then it gets lost in the matter.

00:07:52.188 --> 00:07:55.909
It gets involved in the matter. It gets spoilt in the matter,

00:07:56.167 --> 00:08:02.024
and then what comes back to us is the thought, “How to possess it”.

00:08:02.924 --> 00:08:07.801
To possess the matter, to use the matter,

00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:11.938
to sit on top of the matter was the first mistake.

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:15.461
Matter is your slave, in any case.

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:20.187
In any case it is your slave, and this you would have got it

00:08:20.388 --> 00:08:22.779
without paying so much attention to it.

00:08:23.021 --> 00:08:27.039
To think that science was discovered by scientists is egoistical.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.153
Its only your ego, says that.

00:08:29.365 --> 00:08:31.945
You cannot discover anything unless and until

00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:34.489
the God’s grace is upon you.

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:37.504
It’s the God’s grace that brings forth

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:42.901
the exposition of His powers.

00:08:43.628 --> 00:08:47.287
Even a person like Einstein has said that.

00:08:47.488 --> 00:08:52.332
Even the person like Newton has said that.

00:08:52.543 --> 00:08:57.450
Einstein has clearly said that “I was fed up and I was tired;

00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:00.767
I couldn’t find the theory of relativity;

00:09:00.987 --> 00:09:05.903
I was just resting in my garden playing with soap bubbles,

00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:09.087
and from somewhere unknown

00:09:09.344 --> 00:09:13.189
the theory of relativity dawned upon me”.

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:17.636
But we Indians living, three hundred years

00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:21.490
in the slavish mentality, accepted it blindfolded

00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:25.179
without knowing how much knowledge and science we had.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.179
We had aeroplanes in our country.

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.374
We had pilotless bombs in our country.

00:09:29.593 --> 00:09:32.460
We had all kinds of things in our country.

00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:40.723
But, why did we accept this without going into the roots

00:09:40.924 --> 00:09:44.629
to find out how did we have these things?

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.031
We started doubting all that was the past in India,

00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:50.271
and we would not go into the past of it

00:09:50.472 --> 00:09:55.339
but we started moving downward with this western culture.

00:09:56.472 --> 00:09:59.240
And that’s the downfall of our country.

00:09:59.441 --> 00:10:02.294
That has brought all this nonsense here.

00:10:03.223 --> 00:10:06.750
When money becomes everything, the money orientation,

00:10:06.958 --> 00:10:08.497
the economics of it.

00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:13.524
This was the country of philosophers, of the seers,

00:10:13.725 --> 00:10:17.464
of the saints, where now today economics is dominating

00:10:17.665 --> 00:10:20.463
without understanding that you cannot put this western

00:10:20.664 --> 00:10:24.397
economics in this country at all, we cannot work it out.

00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:28.587
This is a country of generosity.

00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:31.289
People love to serve you, people love to do;

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.239
even today they like to do something for you.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.719
Go to a village, even if they may not have anything with them,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.946
they’ll bring some milk; make you sit there.

00:10:40.147 --> 00:10:42.779
“Please have some milk. You have come from foreign countries,

00:10:43.006 --> 00:10:46.139
please have it.” But in the western countries:

00:10:46.358 --> 00:10:48.834
you may give them any amount of things,

00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:51.693
they won’t even return one present to you.

00:10:51.927 --> 00:10:53.761
Shamelessly they’ll take everything thinking

00:10:53.962 --> 00:10:55.922
that they are the ones who should have it.

00:10:57.056 --> 00:10:59.159
They have no subtleties.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.362
They have no subtleties to understand generosity, they cannot.

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:06.919
They think we do it because we are slavish people.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.724
Even I was surprised when the some villagers told Me

00:11:11.925 --> 00:11:16.338
that even the animals coming from the West are stupid.

00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:22.424
I said, “how?” He said, “Now take a hen from India

00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:28.193
and take a leghorn or rooster from western countries.

00:11:28.394 --> 00:11:32.901
If there is an attack on the little chicks,

00:11:33.612 --> 00:11:36.634
the mother will start shouting or doing something,

00:11:36.835 --> 00:11:40.334
screaming or doing something to call all her children

00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:42.999
under her wings - if it’s an Indian hen.

00:11:43.257 --> 00:11:44.673
But if it’s an English hen, she wouldn’t mind.

00:11:44.874 --> 00:11:46.858
She would look at everything very peacefully,

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:52.970
stithapragya, not bothered.” Then he said,

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.561
“Most surprising thing is that our bullocks,

00:11:55.762 --> 00:11:59.639
if you tell them go this way, that way, they understand.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.059
But if you tell a western bullock,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.025
he walks straight into the car, into the trucks;

00:12:06.198 --> 00:12:10.044
he doesn’t know where he is walking. He has no idea.

00:12:10.245 --> 00:12:11.544
You cannot leave them alone.

00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:12.776
And if you tell them walk this way,

00:12:12.977 --> 00:12:15.377
they will walk the other way round.”

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:17.995
So what is in this culture?

00:12:18.196 --> 00:12:27.075
What is in this whole upbringing that makes you so gross?

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:31.728
The attention is on the matter and not on the spirit.

00:12:31.963 --> 00:12:37.541
All the time the matter is trying to overpower the spirit.

00:12:38.362 --> 00:12:42.548
Supposing there is a tree that falls off, it dies,

00:12:42.749 --> 00:12:46.655
then you make a chair out of it. It’s a dead from the dead.

00:12:46.858 --> 00:12:50.665
Now you sit on the chair and you become a slave of the chair.

00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:53.391
You cannot sit on the ground.

00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:56.162
Then you have to carry chairs with you.

00:12:57.647 --> 00:12:59.781
If you start moving in a car,

00:12:59.982 --> 00:13:05.469
you become so useless that you cannot walk with your legs.

00:13:06.532 --> 00:13:09.132
Tomorrow you start having calculators…

00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:10.745
you’ll be surprised, I live in London

00:13:10.946 --> 00:13:12.733
I am amazed at the people.

00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:17.129
Even if they have to do two plus two they want their tambaaku.

00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:19.827
They want to calculate it.

00:13:20.038 --> 00:13:21.666
For two plus two they cannot do it,

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:24.781
they have no brains left because computers have come.

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:27.690
So as a result of this machinery,

00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:32.166
the machines that have created… We say the “machine age”

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.645
what an age it is - and the age of development.

00:13:36.846 --> 00:13:41.698
Without any control if the machines have

00:13:42.902 --> 00:13:46.904
gone up to this point, it is time that we understand

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:49.933
we should not go too much towards it,

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:52.753
that we become slaves of this machine.

00:13:53.012 --> 00:13:55.545
The machine is like a devil.

00:13:55.746 --> 00:14:01.708
It requires, like a devil, all the time to eat something.

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:07.404
Like, you… in England it’s impossible to get fresh food.

00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:09.675
You have to go to the main market to get it.

00:14:09.878 --> 00:14:12.740
But in America, is even worse

00:14:12.948 --> 00:14:16.623
and in most of the countries they have everything packed,

00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:20.326
everything in a plastic bag, everything measured.

00:14:20.527 --> 00:14:24.206
You go to the shop, you get this, this, this, this… nothing fresh.

00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:28.242
There’s no taste in the food. Now they are using chemicals.

00:14:28.462 --> 00:14:31.594
They put chemicals in the body of the animals, which they eat;

00:14:31.776 --> 00:14:33.934
put chemicals in the foods that they eat;

00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:38.588
put chemicals because the machine must have a quantity.

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:41.114
To have the quantity they have to do all this.

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:43.323
So what you are taking is all this chemicals.

00:14:43.524 --> 00:14:44.461
As a result of that,

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:48.870
what you are developing is nothing else but your destruction

00:14:49.071 --> 00:14:53.320
So all this attention outside, into the matter,

00:14:53.524 --> 00:14:57.141
builds up your destructions gradually.

00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:01.872
The attention gets fragmented.

00:15:02.075 --> 00:15:03.570
For example, you are talking to someone…

00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:06.007
this is a very modern stuff, I have seen many.

00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:09.796
You are talking to someone and this person is looking somewhere else.

00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:10.910
“Where are you looking?”

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:16.913
“Oh, I was looking at that picture or something.

00:15:17.114 --> 00:15:18.342
I think I should buy that.”

00:15:18.543 --> 00:15:22.230
But I am talking to you here - doesn’t go into the head. Nothing.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.301
He is looking at something, or at some woman,

00:15:25.481 --> 00:15:29.414
or at some man - which is joyless pursuit.

00:15:29.615 --> 00:15:34.724
We have nothing to do with it and there is no alertness,

00:15:34.982 --> 00:15:38.192
which picks up things at the right moment.

00:15:38.393 --> 00:15:40.419
Then another thing a gentleman told Me,

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.533
whose four children are in an English school

00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:45.054
and one child in an Indian school.

00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:49.012
He says these four children don’t talk much.

00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:52.403
They think no end of themselves and they don’t know.

00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:58.348
You ask them how many roads there are to your house?

00:15:58.549 --> 00:15:59.744
They wouldn’t know.

00:15:59.927 --> 00:16:04.726
They just go like a blinkers of a horse around their heads.

00:16:04.927 --> 00:16:07.205
They walk like that. They don’t know anything.

00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:09.009
They don’t read newspapers;

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.877
they have no ideas as to what things we have.

00:16:11.078 --> 00:16:14.804
The youngest child, who is brought up in an Indian way

00:16:14.977 --> 00:16:17.820
and in an Indian school, has got a little parrot,

00:16:18.008 --> 00:16:22.205
has got a little doggy, has… looks after all the cows.

00:16:22.406 --> 00:16:27.775
He gives all the news about all the animals in the house.

00:16:27.976 --> 00:16:29.960
He gives all the news about the relations.

00:16:30.164 --> 00:16:32.861
He knows who are the relations, who are suffering,

00:16:33.062 --> 00:16:36.226
what is the problem. What in the kitchen is needed?

00:16:36.427 --> 00:16:39.158
He is so alert, his attention is so alert

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:41.171
because it is not fragmented.

00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:46.072
Now with any convenience,

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:49.265
we want to put our children into English schools.

00:16:49.499 --> 00:16:52.142
I tell you, you’ll have it.

00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:54.418
If they don’t beat you when they grow up,

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:56.645
you shouldn’t be surprised. I’ve seen

00:16:56.846 --> 00:16:59.470
western children beat their parents.

00:17:01.446 --> 00:17:02.473
They answer them back.

00:17:02.674 --> 00:17:05.919
It was a day when the children of a good family

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:11.049
would always address their parents as sir or mother as a madam.

00:17:11.284 --> 00:17:15.047
But today, I have seen them answering them back

00:17:15.248 --> 00:17:17.216
saying all kinds of funny things

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:19.451
and knowing all the filth of the world,

00:17:19.592 --> 00:17:21.586
all the filth of the world.

00:17:21.787 --> 00:17:24.624
They know so much of filth that you are shocked;

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.627
you don’t know that.

00:17:26.828 --> 00:17:29.752
And the whole attitude of all their medias,

00:17:29.953 --> 00:17:32.835
or ours also I should say, in a way,

00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:35.319
is to create that attitude,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.092
to put our children into that filth all the time,

00:17:38.293 --> 00:17:39.988
take them to that filth.

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:44.387
Our people also - I see in the television, here also

00:17:44.616 --> 00:17:47.860
they show all these horribly nude

00:17:48.061 --> 00:17:49.692
funny women in the advertisement.

00:17:49.892 --> 00:17:53.238
Because these advertisements, and the medias also,

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:56.946
work out your attention onto the gross.

00:17:57.158 --> 00:18:00.441
They play on your weaknesses.

00:18:00.642 --> 00:18:04.140
That’s how they make you weak, and when you become weak,

00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:06.069
weak, they become very powerful.

00:18:06.257 --> 00:18:09.857
When the media is so powerful, you can’t do anything.

00:18:10.101 --> 00:18:15.343
There is no purity in their hearts to do benevolence,

00:18:15.544 --> 00:18:17.919
to do good to the people - as we call janahith.

00:18:18.138 --> 00:18:22.242
That’s not in their mind at all. Somehow to make money.

00:18:22.443 --> 00:18:24.643
What’s the harm in making money?

00:18:25.254 --> 00:18:28.428
It’s surprising how people are compromising

00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:32.410
for the sake of money. Money doesn’t give you joy.

00:18:32.629 --> 00:18:35.027
I have to tell you it cannot give you joy.

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.772
Don’t run after money.

00:18:37.012 --> 00:18:41.194
Have a integrated attitude towards money.

00:18:41.395 --> 00:18:43.871
Money is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

00:18:44.074 --> 00:18:47.701
and the Lakshmi is a very beautiful woman

00:18:47.902 --> 00:18:54.261
who has got a very motherly attitude. She is the Mother.

00:18:54.512 --> 00:18:59.222
A man who has money has to have motherly attitude.

00:18:59.754 --> 00:19:03.207
She has got two lotuses in Her hands;

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.705
pink shows that She is love.

00:19:05.916 --> 00:19:08.879
She expresses Her love in two of Her hands

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.767
which also means a lotus which is pink,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:19.824
is even entertaining a thorny bhavraa, we call it

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:24.035
the black big beetle, which has got thorns

00:19:24.236 --> 00:19:30.145
on its soft petals and gives it a place of rest.

00:19:30.408 --> 00:19:32.960
How many of these rich people in this country,

00:19:33.161 --> 00:19:37.461
and specially abroad, would entertain such an idea

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:41.407
of having a place for a ashrayaa,

00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:46.711
for a support for the persons who are like a bhavraa.

00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:57.363
Then, the other hand, which is like this, has to be daan.

00:19:57.564 --> 00:20:00.009
You have to give, if you have money you must give.

00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:02.618
How many of them know where to give money?

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:04.514
They’ll give money to places

00:20:04.715 --> 00:20:08.178
where people will cheat them - like Rajneesh.

00:20:09.546 --> 00:20:12.556
They’ll not give money to the poor.

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:16.585
They’ll not develop anything for the poor in a proper way.

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:18.837
The other day, I was surprised, I went to Poona.

00:20:19.038 --> 00:20:22.548
We have there a very good thing system started

00:20:22.756 --> 00:20:26.225
of called as JanaShanti where people give food

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:29.496
for two rupees, very good food for one, one meal,

00:20:29.708 --> 00:20:33.137
very very good food, excellent food they give and sufficient

00:20:33.366 --> 00:20:37.772
for two rupees. And they said all the, President downward,

00:20:37.973 --> 00:20:40.801
people came here; we had to spend money on their reception.

00:20:41.009 --> 00:20:42.681
We gave them this that, garland,

00:20:42.877 --> 00:20:46.010
this that and everybody gave big big lectures.

00:20:47.182 --> 00:20:51.431
And nobody is willing to even give them a place on rent.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.858
No one wants them there

00:20:53.093 --> 00:20:55.749
because they think you will go into competition

00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:59.147
with others who are making profits and will not get votes.

00:20:59.366 --> 00:21:02.795
So the whole system is so funny

00:21:02.996 --> 00:21:04.810
that you end up at a point that

00:21:05.011 --> 00:21:07.042
they want to give money because they want to have votes.

00:21:07.253 --> 00:21:10.831
They want to win the election because they want to make money.

00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:13.926
I mean, I came to this country and everybody is saying,

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:16.837
“What’s the matter, why can’t we get the plot?”

00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:18.955
Because the person wants to eat the money;

00:21:19.143 --> 00:21:22.012
here everybody eats the money,

00:21:22.213 --> 00:21:24.714
eating the money, paishe khaato.

00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:27.410
Te paishe khata, te paishe khata, te paishe khata.

00:21:27.668 --> 00:21:31.511
Say, don’t they eat their food, or why are they eating money?

00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:34.266
This is the trouble of this country has come because money

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:37.544
has become the most important thing for them.

00:21:37.826 --> 00:21:42.117
Nothing that they think that this body, this being,

00:21:42.318 --> 00:21:46.438
this is a collective being. This is the samoohik being.

00:21:46.665 --> 00:21:49.737
It cannot be happy with this kind of a harm

00:21:49.938 --> 00:21:51.352
we are doing to our society.

00:21:51.553 --> 00:21:53.768
All those who do things like this,

00:21:53.969 --> 00:21:57.024
their seven generations will be cursed by God.

00:21:57.569 --> 00:21:58.491
You must understand:

00:21:58.702 --> 00:22:01.795
those who make money at the cost of the poor people,

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:03.932
they will be cursed forever.

00:22:04.163 --> 00:22:07.552
And one should not join such people,

00:22:07.753 --> 00:22:09.603
even if you have to suffer.

00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:13.905
I know it’s very hard time, people cannot afford

00:22:14.106 --> 00:22:17.994
to live with the earnings they have. But still, if you decide,

00:22:18.238 --> 00:22:22.010
you can live with the satisfaction that you have done right.

00:22:22.221 --> 00:22:25.517
When My father was…

00:22:28.191 --> 00:22:31.323
and My mother, both were in jail so many times.

00:22:31.534 --> 00:22:32.300
We were eleven children.

00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.977
We were very rich people living in huts.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.487
And we didn’t have food for days together sometimes.

00:22:38.688 --> 00:22:40.758
And we have… were used to very rich life.

00:22:40.969 --> 00:22:44.508
They sacrificed everything for the country’s freedom.

00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:47.211
Where are such people now? You can’t think of them.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.399
They are legendary people.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.454
Nobody wants to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:54.493
And this is the movement;

00:22:54.694 --> 00:22:58.311
this is a new movement of swatantra.

00:22:58.512 --> 00:23:02.084
Swaatantrya is not yet complete; you can see it clearly.

00:23:02.285 --> 00:23:04.676
It is not. Your freedom is not complete.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.676
If your freedom has to be complete,

00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:09.561
you must get your swatantra;

00:23:09.762 --> 00:23:14.636
you must know the technique of your swa, of your spirit.

00:23:14.887 --> 00:23:17.543
Unless and until you get this full freedom,

00:23:17.754 --> 00:23:20.730
you are not free people. You are slaves of money.

00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:25.685
You are slaves of powers. You are slaves of showing off.

00:23:25.886 --> 00:23:30.748
You are slaves of everything, to Me. All kinds of bad habits.

00:23:30.949 --> 00:23:34.566
I’ve never known so many drunkards that we find these days.

00:23:34.886 --> 00:23:38.370
So we have become greater slaves of all the bad habits,

00:23:38.582 --> 00:23:43.041
all the bad doings. And there is nothing

00:23:43.242 --> 00:23:48.375
that a person in a big position can think of not doing.

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:51.526
Why it has happened to us?

00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:57.252
Why have we all collapsed into such insipid useless people?

00:23:57.453 --> 00:24:00.374
What has happened to our countrymen? Is this:

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.343
that they have not realized

00:24:02.562 --> 00:24:09.322
that the greatest thing is in the brain. Is the roots,

00:24:09.523 --> 00:24:13.992
and these roots are in this country, in this Maharastra.

00:24:14.266 --> 00:24:19.418
These roots are here. The Kundalini has to only enlighten these roots,

00:24:19.622 --> 00:24:23.161
and we never bothered about it. We never cared for it.

00:24:23.403 --> 00:24:27.136
We are all the time worried as to how to get more money.

00:24:27.429 --> 00:24:29.522
So the people who are highly paid

00:24:29.749 --> 00:24:33.201
or who are at a higher position with less pay, also maybe,

00:24:33.499 --> 00:24:36.032
they are making money by eating that.

00:24:36.304 --> 00:24:38.158
And the others are a sort of people

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:41.319
who are going on strike for everything. For what?

00:24:41.484 --> 00:24:43.619
For money, again for money.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.083
This Bombay is half finished because of strikes.

00:24:47.284 --> 00:24:50.154
What for strikes? I asked them. You are a drunkard?

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:52.839
Yes. You drink? All right. And you smoke? Yes.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.388
You eat tambaaku? Yes. You eat paan.

00:24:55.589 --> 00:24:57.690
That means you have money.

00:24:58.714 --> 00:25:00.487
Otherwise how can you afford all these things?

00:25:00.738 --> 00:25:03.471
When you ask for more money in a strike,

00:25:03.707 --> 00:25:06.035
better find out what sort of a man he is.

00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:07.531
If he can drink, afford to drink,

00:25:07.732 --> 00:25:10.325
then you need not give him any money to drink more.

00:25:10.545 --> 00:25:12.927
Any mother who sees her son is drinking,

00:25:13.128 --> 00:25:14.232
will never give him any money

00:25:14.443 --> 00:25:15.924
because he will be drinking with that money.

00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:19.807
What else is he going to do? What good is he going to do with that?

00:25:20.008 --> 00:25:22.080
So what happens is that this attention,

00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:24.734
when it starts moving towards money,

00:25:24.938 --> 00:25:27.990
we become so blind that we do not see why,

00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:34.381
why are we asking for money. What is the need for money?

00:25:34.582 --> 00:25:36.265
I am not for these capitalists at all.

00:25:36.466 --> 00:25:38.310
I know how horrid they are.

00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:42.612
But what I’m saying that why break the machinery like this.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.537
Now whatever you may do,

00:25:44.802 --> 00:25:47.368
whatever you may tell them that finish this striking

00:25:47.569 --> 00:25:51.022
and enjoy yourself now, for the God sake.

00:25:51.296 --> 00:25:55.229
We have really poor people in the villages, not in Bombay.

00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:57.028
In Bombay we don’t have poor people.

00:25:57.229 --> 00:25:59.596
They can go to cinema; they can do all kinds of things.

00:25:59.862 --> 00:26:03.294
How can they be poor? But they have time.

00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:05.268
They have more time. That’s why they get…

00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:06.362
enter into such things.

00:26:06.563 --> 00:26:10.635
And they are going to finish this Mumbai of yours

00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:12.938
very soon if you allow these people to go on strike.

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:15.467
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity

00:26:15.701 --> 00:26:19.834
and it come from the western people - it’s not from Gandhiji.

00:26:20.427 --> 00:26:23.960
Gandhiji didn’t tell you to fight for money. Did he?

00:26:24.192 --> 00:26:26.792
He asked you to fight for swaatantrya.

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:28.692
And today if he was living,

00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:32.192
he would have talked about Sahaja Yoga, I am sure of that.

00:26:32.497 --> 00:26:35.661
But the problem that exists with us is that

00:26:35.862 --> 00:26:40.752
we don’t want to see that this machinery is now shaking.

00:26:41.081 --> 00:26:42.846
We have to have another system,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:47.009
a parallel system that will crush this stupid machinery,

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.139
which is taking us downward and downward and downward.

00:26:52.061 --> 00:26:54.373
A girl must have ten types of sarees,

00:26:54.593 --> 00:26:57.535
ten types of clothes she must wear, like a Kashmiri girl;

00:26:57.736 --> 00:26:59.027
she must wear like a Punjabi girl;

00:26:59.228 --> 00:27:01.066
she must wear like an English girl.

00:27:01.267 --> 00:27:03.644
What is the need? I mean, we used to have…

00:27:03.853 --> 00:27:05.574
we are rich people, I should… very rich,

00:27:05.775 --> 00:27:06.860
we used to have only two sarees.

00:27:07.064 --> 00:27:08.871
And one for - thevni as they call it -

00:27:09.072 --> 00:27:12.146
one for some special occasions. And we lived well,

00:27:12.347 --> 00:27:15.511
we educated well where attention was learning

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:18.370
and attention was towards God.

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:23.672
But the attention, when it gets lost it fritters away.

00:27:23.993 --> 00:27:25.560
It gets lost. It gets fragmented.

00:27:25.761 --> 00:27:28.151
There’s no continuity in it. It fritters away

00:27:28.339 --> 00:27:30.794
and a person becomes a superficial person,

00:27:30.995 --> 00:27:34.893
extremely superficial. He cannot go deep.

00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:39.748
How can he feel his spirit? The superficiality makes you,

00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:45.446
absolutely, a person who has sort of a crust

00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:51.433
and nothing inside, absolutely what we call the hollowness,

00:27:51.634 --> 00:27:56.134
kokhlapan, completely hollow. If you just break that man,

00:27:56.353 --> 00:27:58.621
you find out he is not a man of character.

00:27:58.822 --> 00:28:00.805
He is not a man to be dependant upon.

00:28:01.025 --> 00:28:03.110
He is not a man who talks good of others.

00:28:03.322 --> 00:28:06.876
He will try to pull you down. This is what happens to your attention

00:28:07.101 --> 00:28:14.237
and you become extremely, extremely low-level human being.

00:28:14.438 --> 00:28:17.797
You’ll be surprised I went to four villages before coming here

00:28:18.133 --> 00:28:23.087
and the people who were there were five times more than Bombay people.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.620
They came, they didn’t have cars, nothing;

00:28:25.878 --> 00:28:30.833
they didn’t have buses. They came walking. They came on bullock carts.

00:28:31.034 --> 00:28:35.508
And such a big crowd and all of them got realization

00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:39.309
because, thank God, they don’t know English language.

00:28:39.937 --> 00:28:45.177
And these nonsensical ideas that we have got from the western culture.

00:28:45.662 --> 00:28:49.458
We are not to compete with them. They have to compete with us.

00:28:49.771 --> 00:28:51.904
They have nothing to offer you.

00:28:52.677 --> 00:28:55.748
You have to stick onto your ideal. But instead of that,

00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:57.417
we have learnt all the bad things,

00:28:57.628 --> 00:29:00.221
and all the bad traditions like taking dowry,

00:29:00.456 --> 00:29:03.983
torturing our women and doing all these things,

00:29:04.218 --> 00:29:08.131
which do not at all look civil.

00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:12.335
In that we are not modern. In that we are not modern;

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:16.032
in that we are very very primitive.

00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:19.664
But it was never so before. Nobody used to torture wives.

00:29:19.836 --> 00:29:22.875
We never knew there was a dowry system in India.

00:29:23.117 --> 00:29:24.057
Nobody knew it.

00:29:24.258 --> 00:29:26.617
It is absolutely something we cannot understand

00:29:26.859 --> 00:29:30.414
from where it came, and I discovered it came from the English only.

00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:34.176
Because they said we should be very,

00:29:34.377 --> 00:29:38.106
very balanced about our children.

00:29:38.307 --> 00:29:41.895
And we should not give only the money to the boy.

00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:44.588
They’ll just quarrel but we should give it to the girl also.

00:29:44.815 --> 00:29:48.283
Because, you see, the whole inheritance will go to the boys,

00:29:48.518 --> 00:29:50.923
the land will go to the boys, you must give some money.

00:29:51.124 --> 00:29:54.334
That was sensible but we have gone to the extremes now,

00:29:54.515 --> 00:29:57.233
and all these problems are coming before us,

00:29:57.434 --> 00:30:00.376
which we call as social problems.

00:30:00.577 --> 00:30:01.939
Then we have problems,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.623
which we call as emotional problems out of family problems.

00:30:07.694 --> 00:30:09.717
Now if you want to follow them

00:30:09.918 --> 00:30:11.503
then I would like to give you the picture

00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:13.566
how their family lives are.

00:30:13.746 --> 00:30:16.990
So that you’ll understand that you just stop

00:30:17.191 --> 00:30:20.227
having all those ideas into your heads.

00:30:20.477 --> 00:30:23.878
The family picture is like this:

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:29.144
That a husband and wife get married, so called.

00:30:29.345 --> 00:30:34.341
Within say a year or so, they are divorced.

00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:40.046
Then in one lifetime they’ll have eight husbands and eight wives, at least.

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:44.101
Then they all land up in the orphanage in old age.

00:30:44.312 --> 00:30:46.155
The children are in the orphanage.

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:50.542
The father is in the orphanage and the mother is also in the orphanage.

00:30:50.743 --> 00:30:54.149
All the mothers, fathers, everybody ends up in orphanage.

00:30:54.415 --> 00:31:01.307
There is no love. There is no feeling in England itself,

00:31:01.508 --> 00:31:05.015
I was feeling, but it is only in London.

00:31:05.305 --> 00:31:09.058
Two children are killed by their parents.

00:31:09.259 --> 00:31:12.769
There’s no compassion. There’s no daya.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.314
There’s no karuna in them.

00:31:14.548 --> 00:31:17.722
And that’s what today happening to us also.

00:31:17.923 --> 00:31:19.720
Our children are going the same way.

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:22.378
Our parents are going the same way.

00:31:22.627 --> 00:31:26.439
So as My mother always used to say, “lakshya kuthe?”

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.936
where’s your attention? Where is your attention?

00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:33.249
So you would say that no, my attention is nowhere.

00:31:33.437 --> 00:31:35.733
Nowhere means what? Should be on God.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.235
Where is your attention? Should be on God.

00:31:40.436 --> 00:31:43.149
Devaa kade lakshya thevaa. Keep attention towards God.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.161
Where is your attention?

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:47.326
Even when they taught music they used to say,

00:31:47.499 --> 00:31:52.368
“first think of God.” Anything they did, think of God.

00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:54.368
When you think of God,

00:31:54.569 --> 00:31:59.571
you don’t think of other nonsensical things but sensible things.

00:31:59.772 --> 00:32:02.581
And that is how our… our attention frittered away

00:32:02.782 --> 00:32:04.713
because when the attention comes out

00:32:04.914 --> 00:32:14.226
it attacks the modern, because there’s a challenge.

00:32:14.427 --> 00:32:18.258
As a result of that fight the attention breaks into fragments.

00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:20.281
There is no... Fragmentation is there.

00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:21.742
Your attention is not collected.

00:32:21.943 --> 00:32:23.748
You don’t know where you are, where you are moving.

00:32:23.949 --> 00:32:25.648
You can’t see anything; you don’t understand.

00:32:25.849 --> 00:32:27.639
You ask them one question, they don’t know.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.419
They’ve forgotten. What is your father’s name?

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.393
“No, I don’t know what’s my father’s name”.

00:32:35.308 --> 00:32:38.638
This is the situation, which they are facing.

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:44.198
You have no idea as to what hell they are living into.

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:49.622
And if you want to take yourself and your children to that hell, follow them.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.278
But it doesn’t mean that you go to these bhajjis

00:32:54.493 --> 00:32:56.906
and give them money, or go to these horrible gurus.

00:32:57.107 --> 00:33:01.750
It doesn’t mean that either. It never means that.

00:33:01.951 --> 00:33:03.125
You avoid that nonsense

00:33:03.326 --> 00:33:05.880
because your parents were stupid to go to these gurus.

00:33:06.068 --> 00:33:08.458
These have started only hundred years back.

00:33:08.654 --> 00:33:10.013
We have never known such people.

00:33:10.216 --> 00:33:11.614
Before, these bhondoos we never knew.

00:33:11.834 --> 00:33:14.482
Hundred years back nobody talks except for Nanaka,

00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:16.998
who has said it that these bhondoos must be avoided.

00:33:17.199 --> 00:33:19.498
“Sadguru che lakshan he” and all these things

00:33:19.699 --> 00:33:23.826
have been written by Ramdaasa. But who reads Ramdaas?

00:33:24.027 --> 00:33:26.271
Because he was a Brahmin, non-Brahmins won’t read.

00:33:26.472 --> 00:33:28.628
Who will read Tukharaama? Because he was a non-Brahmin,

00:33:28.829 --> 00:33:33.693
Brahmins won’t read it. If their caste is such a big thing,

00:33:33.894 --> 00:33:37.647
that by reading something it falls off, better give it up.

00:33:37.835 --> 00:33:39.514
All these caste systems

00:33:39.749 --> 00:33:42.970
and all these are now so much settled into our heads.

00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:45.640
So much settled; it was never so before.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.330
It’s very surprising.

00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:51.397
And in the early times there was no caste system.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.127
There was a caste system according to your karmas,

00:33:54.328 --> 00:33:58.084
according to your doings, not according to where you are born.

00:33:58.292 --> 00:34:02.440
Otherwise, how could Valmiki be called a brahma rishi?

00:34:02.675 --> 00:34:06.798
And how could Vyasa, who was an illegitimate child

00:34:06.999 --> 00:34:12.066
of a fisherwoman, could be called as the greatest of greatest?

00:34:14.785 --> 00:34:17.998
All these false ideas have to fall out,

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.722
and for that we have to start a new system.

00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:24.217
And a new system has to come forward through the people

00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:26.928
who have achieved their yoga.

00:34:27.129 --> 00:34:29.225
Shri Krishna Himself has clearly said,

00:34:29.433 --> 00:34:32.339
“yogakshema vahamyaham” - when you get your yoga,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.780
you will get kshema. Always He has said about yogis.

00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:39.290
He has used the word yogis for that.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.243
These yogis have to come that,

00:34:41.444 --> 00:34:43.110
and as you have read in the Pasaydaan just now

00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:47.545
you have heard about it that the forests,

00:34:47.772 --> 00:34:54.493
forests of these great people who are kalpatarus,

00:34:54.694 --> 00:34:59.126
who are the givers of your desires, will be walking.

00:34:59.327 --> 00:35:01.874
These are the yogis.

00:35:02.132 --> 00:35:07.194
And the oceans of this talking nectar

00:35:07.656 --> 00:35:13.699
will be talking about God. These are the yogis.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.189
Others are all ordinary useless people,

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.944
will be frittered away.

00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:21.219
Only the yogis will be respected in the kingdom of God.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.288
And we have to bring the kingdom of God on this earth.

00:35:24.499 --> 00:35:29.302
First in India, then everywhere. Here it is going to come.

00:35:29.503 --> 00:35:35.612
Now people might say Marxism, this ism, that ism.

00:35:36.456 --> 00:35:43.222
Tukaraama has said ava ghaachi samsaara sukha cha kari.

00:35:43.423 --> 00:35:46.508
He said it. Same - Marx says the same.

00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:48.927
He says that the whole world should be so…

00:35:49.123 --> 00:35:52.305
such a happy place, such a happy place

00:35:52.506 --> 00:35:56.306
that there should be no state.

00:35:56.714 --> 00:36:01.693
How? Nobody asked him how. He talks of evolution. How?

00:36:01.894 --> 00:36:04.593
How the evolution is going to take place? Ask him.

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:06.327
Ask all these communists.

00:36:06.523 --> 00:36:09.054
They are not becoming better people. Are they?

00:36:09.273 --> 00:36:10.873
Who is becoming better?

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.421
Who is getting transformed by that Isms? None of them.

00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:16.585
Somebody is a disciple of this gentleman.

00:36:16.793 --> 00:36:18.359
Somebody is a disciple of that gentleman.

00:36:18.598 --> 00:36:21.625
Somebody is following this kind of a political theory.

00:36:21.826 --> 00:36:24.568
Another following that kind of a theory. It’s a theory.

00:36:24.769 --> 00:36:28.161
In Marathi as they say, “bhola cha tsa baata bhola chi tsa kari”.

00:36:28.414 --> 00:36:29.458
Whatever theories you have,

00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:30.994
you have written down on your heads.

00:36:31.175 --> 00:36:34.935
Are you going to get transformation with that?

00:36:35.136 --> 00:36:38.073
There has to, something, happen within you.

00:36:38.268 --> 00:36:41.911
If you have to get to that point what Marx has said,

00:36:42.112 --> 00:36:44.271
what Tukaraama has said.

00:36:44.472 --> 00:36:48.568
This parivarthan, this change, this transformation has to take place

00:36:48.795 --> 00:36:52.662
and that’s only possible through the Kundalini awakening.

00:36:53.475 --> 00:36:55.146
There are people who have read about Kundalini.

00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:56.365
They come and ask Me,

00:36:56.566 --> 00:36:58.857
“Mother this Kundalini that You are talking about,

00:36:59.045 --> 00:37:01.045
people say that this Kundalini can give us madness, this that.”

00:37:03.637 --> 00:37:05.592
Even they have said that six,

00:37:05.793 --> 00:37:09.199
sixth chapter of Gynaneshwari should not be read at all

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:11.394
7because it deals with Kundalini.

00:37:11.598 --> 00:37:13.445
Naturally - because they don’t know anything about it.

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:15.625
So it is better not to deal with it.

00:37:15.844 --> 00:37:20.846
But Kundalini is the shuddha iccha, is the real icchaa,

00:37:21.047 --> 00:37:22.985
is the one that is going to give you

00:37:23.186 --> 00:37:25.935
that what you are born for, is going to give you.

00:37:26.139 --> 00:37:30.618
After that you do not want anything else.

00:37:30.819 --> 00:37:33.924
It’s not like the economics that you want today this,

00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:38.041
tomorrow that and it is never satiable in general.

00:37:38.242 --> 00:37:41.197
It gets completely…

00:37:41.405 --> 00:37:47.551
the thing that you want is the entire source of satisfaction.

00:37:47.752 --> 00:37:50.317
But is the movement is upward;

00:37:50.536 --> 00:37:54.082
the Kundalini doesn’t go downward towards the gravity,

00:37:54.294 --> 00:37:56.778
towards the matter.

00:37:57.864 --> 00:38:04.679
It comes up. It moves upward and pierces through this

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.905
fontanelle bone area and you get your self-realization.

00:38:09.106 --> 00:38:11.882
This is what you should ask from any guru.

00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:14.973
All the rest of it is useless. How can you pay for it?

00:38:15.169 --> 00:38:18.327
Can you show rupee to that Kundalini?

00:38:18.528 --> 00:38:21.874
It’s a living process of the living evolution,

00:38:22.075 --> 00:38:23.075
which has to take place.

00:38:23.263 --> 00:38:26.863
You have to achieve the epitome of your life by this.

00:38:27.052 --> 00:38:28.421
How are you going to do it?

00:38:28.622 --> 00:38:31.668
Are you going to do it by standing on your head?

00:38:31.888 --> 00:38:34.346
Any living process like a sprouting of a seed,

00:38:34.547 --> 00:38:37.455
how do you do it? You put the seed in the Mother Earth.

00:38:37.656 --> 00:38:41.190
And She has the power and She just sprouts it.

00:38:41.391 --> 00:38:44.351
In the same way it has to happen that it should sprout.

00:38:44.564 --> 00:38:49.205
In that same manner it should sprout spontaneously.

00:38:49.406 --> 00:38:52.473
Sahaj. Saha – with, ja - born.

00:38:52.674 --> 00:38:58.134
This is born with you. To get this yoga is your birthright.

00:38:58.346 --> 00:39:01.832
Get it, and for Indians it’s a special blessing

00:39:02.033 --> 00:39:04.935
that they get it very fast. Just like their independence,

00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:08.136
without any effort. Without much struggle, I should say.

00:39:08.347 --> 00:39:10.425
Others have struggled much more than us.

00:39:10.643 --> 00:39:15.349
When you get that you also loose it very fast.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:20.541
So those people who understand Kundalini

00:39:20.742 --> 00:39:23.351
understand the essence of everything

00:39:23.547 --> 00:39:28.721
and they understand that all the religions are on one essence.

00:39:28.922 --> 00:39:32.200
They are the flowers of the same tree.

00:39:32.428 --> 00:39:34.344
Stupidly we are fighting here.

00:39:34.545 --> 00:39:41.161
Christ has said those who are not against us are with us.

00:39:41.362 --> 00:39:43.809
Who are those? Christians don’t want to find out.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.931
Now they are after Christ’s life.

00:39:47.158 --> 00:39:49.558
Hindus don’t want to know about it.

00:39:49.807 --> 00:39:53.093
There is no greatness of art. I would say now,

00:39:53.294 --> 00:39:58.590
there was a problem in Aurangabad and the people attacked.

00:39:58.856 --> 00:40:00.598
They should not have attacked. All right.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.437
But we have to understand what has happened in this one,

00:40:04.638 --> 00:40:08.437
where we have gone wrong. We should see our mistake.

00:40:08.638 --> 00:40:12.012
In a masjid, whatever it is, it’s a God place.

00:40:12.247 --> 00:40:15.910
It’s a God’s place, and in a masjid if they are meditating,

00:40:16.075 --> 00:40:19.516
you should not make noise. If you are insulting that,

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.537
you are insulting Vittala Himself.

00:40:24.372 --> 00:40:26.602
In the Vittala mandir you have a different type of aarti,

00:40:26.803 --> 00:40:30.449
all right, have it. In that aarti if somebody starts

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:35.910
doing discotheque dance, how will you like it?

00:40:37.641 --> 00:40:40.774
In the same way if that is a place of ibaadat,

00:40:41.027 --> 00:40:44.412
is a place where people are praying in a dhyana.

00:40:44.613 --> 00:40:47.706
Just now we are so quiet, we are sitting in the

00:40:47.917 --> 00:40:54.456
surrounding horrible noises, but everything is quiet.

00:40:54.657 --> 00:40:56.105
That’s why we are enjoying.

00:40:56.306 --> 00:41:00.458
And if that is the way they want to meditate,

00:41:00.659 --> 00:41:02.670
must we go and disturb them

00:41:02.873 --> 00:41:05.896
for something that some boys are troubling and all that?

00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:09.002
Can’t we respect it? To show our greatness,

00:41:09.194 --> 00:41:12.349
khorpana, must we do that?

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.042
Is it very important that at that time

00:41:15.243 --> 00:41:20.149
we should take these besura, betaala bands in front of that?

00:41:23.766 --> 00:41:28.122
Why don’t we see that we also must respect

00:41:28.323 --> 00:41:30.833
whatever is God, everywhere?

00:41:31.034 --> 00:41:32.650
This is the mistake we commit.

00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:36.189
In the name of religion we insult God Himself.

00:41:36.398 --> 00:41:39.064
When they say “Allah-O-Akbar”, they mean Virat,

00:41:39.265 --> 00:41:41.772
means Shri Krishna Itself. If you come to Sahaja yoga,

00:41:41.945 --> 00:41:43.952
you will know that they are all related to each other.

00:41:44.148 --> 00:41:47.548
That Mohammed Sahib was nothing (but) a maha medha.

00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:52.804
He was the Dattatreya Himself. This is the medha,

00:41:53.005 --> 00:41:55.606
and He is settled down there.

00:41:55.872 --> 00:41:58.911
I know He was given poison and He was tortured.

00:41:59.075 --> 00:42:02.586
And the same thing - when we do it by saying

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:05.130
that Mohammed was wrong. He was not wrong.

00:42:05.326 --> 00:42:07.586
Who was wrong? Are the Muslims. Who was wrong?

00:42:07.787 --> 00:42:10.185
Is the Hindus. Who was wrong? Are the Christians.

00:42:10.386 --> 00:42:12.380
They are all against all these prophets,

00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:16.703
all these great incarnations and bringing bad name to them.

00:42:16.904 --> 00:42:22.068
Let us start understanding. Let us start respecting.

00:42:22.269 --> 00:42:26.307
Let us be great. Let us be noble.

00:42:26.533 --> 00:42:30.783
Let us be higher people of affection,

00:42:31.002 --> 00:42:34.127
compassion and understanding. Let us be those people.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.292
Let us start. Let us start a nucleus like that.

00:42:37.493 --> 00:42:39.072
If you can do it, we can

00:42:39.273 --> 00:42:42.715
make all those who have gone down also

00:42:42.915 --> 00:42:45.425
pull back all of them upward.

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.788
It was built in this country - this system.

00:42:48.937 --> 00:42:53.244
Whole thing was built in this country that we should ascend.

00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:55.632
Very beautifully done longtime back

00:42:55.828 --> 00:43:00.189
but was lost in the deluge of modern life.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:04.051
So people should take to all the traditional things,

00:43:04.229 --> 00:43:06.715
which are beautiful, all the traditional games

00:43:06.864 --> 00:43:12.421
that are beautiful, all the traditions that give respect.

00:43:12.622 --> 00:43:14.300
If you loose the sense of respect,

00:43:14.501 --> 00:43:18.563
you have lost the humanity, absolutely hundred percent.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.454
If you do not know how to respect,

00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:23.339
you are not an Indian at all. You are not an Indian.

00:43:23.527 --> 00:43:28.459
Don’t call yourself an Indian. You must learn how to respect.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:32.489
Respect gives you greatness. It makes you humble

00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:37.637
like Tukharaama said,

00:43:37.838 --> 00:43:43.085
“anurenu uni thodkaa, tukha aakaashaye vadaa”.

00:43:43.304 --> 00:43:45.335
When he becomes smaller than anurenu

00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:48.689
then he becomes aakaashaye vadaa.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:52.439
In the vadaat tree the seed is so very small,

00:43:52.627 --> 00:43:54.931
if you see that, it’s a extremely small

00:43:55.138 --> 00:43:57.338
and the biggest tree it creates.

00:43:57.908 --> 00:44:02.175
Once Shastriji said that even the small thing can do great job.

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:05.537
And that’s what we are seeing. That a small thing,

00:44:05.738 --> 00:44:07.683
only when you become humble,

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.738
then the grace of God surrounds your humility,

00:44:10.939 --> 00:44:13.687
surrounds your personality. And you become

00:44:13.888 --> 00:44:18.844
really a personality that has authority of God.

00:44:19.045 --> 00:44:22.740
That is the greatness of God - in that humility it works,

00:44:22.936 --> 00:44:24.180
it just works.

00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:28.001
After realization, the attention becomes enlightened.

00:44:28.204 --> 00:44:31.482
By that attention, looking at people

00:44:31.683 --> 00:44:33.011
you can raise their Kundalini.

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:36.071
Only looking at people you can cure them.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.110
All your powers are expressed in your attention

00:44:39.329 --> 00:44:42.488
and you don’t get lost in the matter.

00:44:42.689 --> 00:44:44.532
Then you become the Baadshah.

00:44:44.775 --> 00:44:49.417
Baadshah is a person who doesn’t mind anything;

00:44:49.618 --> 00:44:51.339
he doesn’t need anything.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.011
As you know, I am born in a rich family and

00:44:55.136 --> 00:44:59.662
My in-laws are also rich. My husband is rich and all that,

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:02.347
but I can live there, I can sleep there.

00:45:02.542 --> 00:45:04.870
I have lived in the jungles. I have lived along the rivers.

00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.847
I have no problem because - why do I want anything?

00:45:09.003 --> 00:45:11.387
Nothing can dominate Me. You can sleep on the stones.

00:45:11.588 --> 00:45:12.611
You can do what you like.

00:45:12.783 --> 00:45:15.892
But that’s only possible when you become the yogi.

00:45:16.104 --> 00:45:17.892
When you become the yogi, you can do it.

00:45:18.057 --> 00:45:20.259
These four hundred people, who have come from abroad,

00:45:20.416 --> 00:45:22.798
come from very rich families, very good families.

00:45:22.999 --> 00:45:25.403
And they have got all the comforts that you can think of,

00:45:25.604 --> 00:45:30.093
but they want to live under the sky, near the river.

00:45:30.351 --> 00:45:34.007
They just don’t want to see the cement on top of their heads.

00:45:34.241 --> 00:45:38.247
They are so much, now, in the higher level

00:45:38.448 --> 00:45:40.971
that they don’t want to see anything that is gross.

00:45:41.172 --> 00:45:44.312
They want this mud.

00:45:44.501 --> 00:45:49.627
They want this beautiful clay of this country.

00:45:49.828 --> 00:45:54.080
Kya deshachi maati bokha lagait. Tithe baslaat tumhi.

00:45:54.322 --> 00:45:58.055
You are sitting on top of that; and what are you doing?

00:45:59.643 --> 00:46:05.200
Your attention, where is it? Where is your attention?

00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:08.994
You must keep your attention to God;

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.434
and once that is there, you’ll become a yogi.

00:46:12.635 --> 00:46:15.286
And once you become the yogi,

00:46:15.487 --> 00:46:22.158
you will be in the realm of God, in the kingdom of heaven.

00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:24.151
When you’ll be blessed with everything

00:46:24.352 --> 00:46:26.625
you don’t have to desire. It will just before,

00:46:26.826 --> 00:46:31.133
you will not know how to contain all that God has given you,

00:46:31.334 --> 00:46:33.810
the kshema that He gives you. Apart from that,

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.375
your attention itself will be such a powerful

00:46:38.576 --> 00:46:42.293
instrument that you can change the entire universe with that.

00:46:42.493 --> 00:46:45.426
Why I beg of you? - Because you are Indians.

00:46:45.719 --> 00:46:48.550
You are born in this country because of poorva sukrutaas,

00:46:48.777 --> 00:46:51.510
because what you have done in last life.

00:46:51.769 --> 00:46:54.574
That’s why you are born in this great country.

00:46:54.793 --> 00:46:58.660
But it’s like those who have teeth don’t have the chanas to eat,

00:46:58.861 --> 00:47:02.251
and those who don’t have teeth have got the chanas.

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:05.319
It’s like that. The situation is very bad.

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.967
You are the ones who can become the greatest yogis,

00:47:08.179 --> 00:47:10.300
but you do not. But the western people

00:47:10.501 --> 00:47:14.110
who do not have any idea about holiness,

00:47:14.311 --> 00:47:17.766
about auspiciousness, nothing they are so ignorant

00:47:17.978 --> 00:47:21.925
they shoot off much faster than you can.

00:47:22.149 --> 00:47:25.287
So I have to make a humble request to you that

00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:32.376
do not get enamored by this attention that goes to any matter.

00:47:32.577 --> 00:47:36.387
But matter itself is made by God.

00:47:37.669 --> 00:47:41.106
So despite the fact human beings got involved

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:43.377
into the material advancement,

00:47:43.755 --> 00:47:47.254
it is today helping us in Sahaja yoga in a very great way.

00:47:47.435 --> 00:47:51.850
For example, this mic is important,

00:47:52.051 --> 00:47:54.350
is also useful for carrying My vibrations.

00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:59.334
It carries vibrations. Camera shows all the light around Me

00:47:59.535 --> 00:48:02.484
and shows all the kinds of forms I have.

00:48:02.685 --> 00:48:05.265
So whatever you may try,

00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:08.981
the Divine will sparkle through that matter also

00:48:09.185 --> 00:48:13.247
and will establish the existence of Divinity.

00:48:14.357 --> 00:48:18.382
But if you cut out the Divinity out of the matter,

00:48:18.583 --> 00:48:22.524
you will be hit hard and you’ll be submerged

00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:26.914
in the greater ocean of ignorance and filth.

00:48:27.665 --> 00:48:32.301
So keep Divinity at your heart and then deal with matter.

00:48:32.502 --> 00:48:36.361
And then you will understand what is the use of this matter,

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.577
and what one has to do with it.

00:48:38.814 --> 00:48:42.862
Tomorrow, in Hindi, I will be talking about the rest of it

00:48:43.063 --> 00:48:50.870
about the truth because today I’ve talked about the Chit.

00:48:51.058 --> 00:48:52.823
Tomorrow I’ll be talking about the truth.

00:48:52.996 --> 00:48:56.810
Sat-Chit-Anand. And third day I’ll be talking

00:48:57.011 --> 00:48:59.813
about Anand to you in Marathi language.

00:49:00.032 --> 00:49:06.128
I hope you will sit down and meditate on what I have said.

00:49:06.329 --> 00:49:09.674
I do not want to condemn any culture as such.

00:49:09.875 --> 00:49:13.160
But I want to protect you from what has happened

00:49:13.361 --> 00:49:16.257
to that culture and where it has gone,

00:49:16.469 --> 00:49:21.510
to bring you back to your own great culture,

00:49:21.711 --> 00:49:24.222
which came to us in thousands of years.

00:49:24.433 --> 00:49:27.701
Their culture is very, very, very new,

00:49:27.902 --> 00:49:29.848
it’s very new and one day they will also have

00:49:30.049 --> 00:49:31.982
the same culture as we have.

00:49:32.299 --> 00:49:34.752
But why not we short circuit it

00:49:35.026 --> 00:49:38.309
and adjust ourselves to this great culture,

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:46.322
which is so much God oriented, not money oriented,

00:49:46.487 --> 00:49:50.357
ego oriented but God oriented?

00:49:50.558 --> 00:49:56.834
Let us all attain that state of yogi.

00:49:57.062 --> 00:49:59.506
I hope today it will happen to all of you

00:49:59.694 --> 00:50:02.423
and that you’ll all get your realization.

00:50:02.624 --> 00:50:04.186
May God bless you.
