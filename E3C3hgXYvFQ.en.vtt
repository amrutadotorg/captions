WEBVTT

00:30.507 --> 00:34.514
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:40.466 --> 00:47.715
As it is, today, a question has been put forward before Me

00:47.916 --> 00:55.242
that why our attention gets lost; in the modern times,

00:55.443 --> 01:00.015
why our attention is not towards God.

01:00.216 --> 01:01.812
And that, in modern times,

01:02.013 --> 01:09.680
why a human being has gone down in his quality of humanity.

01:11.747 --> 01:15.739
These questions point out to one single fact

01:15.940 --> 01:23.940
that our attention has been challenged by modern times.

01:39.837 --> 01:42.915
This attention has been challenged

01:43.282 --> 01:46.430
by all that we call modern today.

01:48.992 --> 01:52.880
I do not say that we have to be primitive people.

01:53.081 --> 02:02.160
In this great country of ours, India, which was Bharatvarsh,

02:02.369 --> 02:05.525
we had such a great quality of humanity,

02:05.744 --> 02:12.486
such a great quality of administration,

02:12.767 --> 02:20.340
quality of kings, queens; all that was not a myth.

02:20.541 --> 02:26.160
It was a fact that we had Rama, Krishna

02:26.361 --> 02:33.345
the benevolent king and a great diplomat of the divine force.

02:33.546 --> 02:39.533
But today we find all these things sound like mythical

02:39.734 --> 02:45.070
because at what level we are, we see that as the truth,

02:45.271 --> 02:48.945
as the reality - but it is not.

02:49.703 --> 02:54.050
All this is created by human beings.

02:54.524 --> 02:59.155
How this is created, and why it has happened,

02:59.356 --> 03:02.754
I would like to explain to you.

03:04.302 --> 03:10.642
When our attention was created before, in a way

03:10.843 --> 03:16.897
that we were living with very few things in this country,

03:19.864 --> 03:26.862
everyone knew that you have to have your self-realization.

03:27.063 --> 03:29.696
Nobody bothered their heads about

03:29.899 --> 03:34.416
how much wealth you are going to acquire,
how many things we are going to have,

03:34.617 --> 03:38.917
except for the kings who acquired wealth

03:39.118 --> 03:43.084
for the betterment of the society and also

03:43.285 --> 03:48.972
who acquired the power for the protection of the society.

03:50.580 --> 03:55.125
Then we became slaves of two cultures

03:55.326 --> 04:00.427
One the Islamic, another the British culture,

04:00.628 --> 04:02.028
the English culture.

04:02.972 --> 04:04.753
And I think the real downfall came

04:04.972 --> 04:07.901
when this English culture came upon us.

04:08.144 --> 04:11.518
Because, though they were Muslims they believed in God.

04:11.690 --> 04:13.127
Whatever wrong they did,

04:13.456 --> 04:16.831
they did it in the name of God and they believed it.

04:17.032 --> 04:20.435
But the attention was not, still, in acquiring things.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.307
We say that Aurangazeb was a very bad king, no doubt.

04:23.508 --> 04:27.101
He killed so many Hindus because he believed

04:27.297 --> 04:29.916
that Islam is the only religion.

04:30.117 --> 04:32.085
That was his stupidity I should say.

04:32.286 --> 04:34.957
He was ignorant; he was so violent.

04:35.169 --> 04:40.991
But he himself was an extremely frugal person.

04:41.192 --> 04:43.157
He used to make his own caps,

04:43.358 --> 04:45.490
sell them in the market and live on that.

04:45.691 --> 04:51.490
And he would not touch any money of the public.

04:52.419 --> 04:56.168
But then the English, when they started ruling in this country,

04:56.427 --> 04:59.007
this language English came upon us

04:59.208 --> 05:03.552
as not a blessing but a curse, I think.

05:03.753 --> 05:10.050
Because the whole literature is full with ideas

05:10.251 --> 05:14.680
which are contrary to the culture of God,

05:14.881 --> 05:18.105
contrary to the culture of Christ.

05:18.306 --> 05:21.655
They believed that Christ was born in England.

05:21.856 --> 05:25.466
Many Christians still believe that you become a sahab

05:25.667 --> 05:27.606
when you become Christians.

05:28.895 --> 05:33.482
This culture of the English which was forced on us,

05:33.683 --> 05:35.785
this language which was forced on us,

05:36.019 --> 05:42.170
gave us a absolutely a different direction

05:42.371 --> 05:45.152
which we should not have accepted.

05:45.355 --> 05:49.480
But as it is, we were three hundred years already in the slavery,

05:49.699 --> 05:53.332
people had to accept it blindfolded.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.936
Shri Krishna has clearly said

05:57.137 --> 06:01.744
that the awareness grows downward

06:01.994 --> 06:08.121
while the roots are in the brain of a person;

06:08.322 --> 06:13.800
and the awareness, which is growing downwards,

06:14.001 --> 06:19.765
forms the tree. And this western culture is the one,

06:19.966 --> 06:24.083
which makes you grow downwards towards materialism;

06:24.318 --> 06:28.714
whether it is communism or it is socialism or democracy

06:28.915 --> 06:30.331
that makes no difference.

06:30.532 --> 06:38.016
The whole thing is that you have to attend to the material side.

06:38.423 --> 06:43.792
So the first object of the western culture

06:43.993 --> 06:49.164
or the western science was, first to capture the matter,

06:49.391 --> 06:51.524
the five elements in such a way

06:51.751 --> 06:54.351
that it can be used for the comfort of human beings,

06:54.552 --> 06:59.125
for the physical comfort of human beings.

06:59.646 --> 07:03.656
But as the culture is just to move forward

07:03.857 --> 07:06.560
without any control over yourself,

07:06.761 --> 07:09.846
like a kite flying in the air

07:10.073 --> 07:15.318
without having any control of a finger on it,

07:15.519 --> 07:19.446
the whole thing drifted into various

07:19.647 --> 07:27.065
directions and various fields, where it got lost.

07:27.332 --> 07:33.633
When we pay attention to something, if the attention is pure,

07:33.842 --> 07:41.150
it will purify the matter and will come back to us as a pure attention.

07:41.392 --> 07:44.376
But when the attention is filled with these ideas

07:44.572 --> 07:49.349
that you have to use all the matter for your comfort,

07:49.550 --> 07:51.987
then it gets lost in the matter.

07:52.188 --> 07:55.909
It gets involved in the matter. It gets spoilt in the matter,

07:56.167 --> 08:02.024
and then what comes back to us is the thought, “How to possess it”.

08:02.924 --> 08:07.801
To possess the matter, to use the matter,

08:08.002 --> 08:11.938
to sit on top of the matter was the first mistake.

08:12.139 --> 08:15.461
Matter is your slave, in any case.

08:15.662 --> 08:20.187
In any case it is your slave, and this you would have got it

08:20.388 --> 08:22.779
without paying so much attention to it.

08:23.021 --> 08:27.039
To think that science was discovered by scientists is egoistical.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.153
Its only your ego, says that.

08:29.365 --> 08:31.945
You cannot discover anything unless and until

08:32.146 --> 08:34.489
the God’s grace is upon you.

08:34.904 --> 08:37.504
It’s the God’s grace that brings forth

08:38.637 --> 08:42.901
the exposition of His powers.

08:43.628 --> 08:47.287
Even a person like Einstein has said that.

08:47.488 --> 08:52.332
Even the person like Newton has said that.

08:52.543 --> 08:57.450
Einstein has clearly said that “I was fed up and I was tired;

08:57.651 --> 09:00.767
I couldn’t find the theory of relativity;

09:00.987 --> 09:05.903
I was just resting in my garden playing with soap bubbles,

09:06.104 --> 09:09.087
and from somewhere unknown

09:09.344 --> 09:13.189
the theory of relativity dawned upon me”.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.636
But we Indians living, three hundred years

09:17.871 --> 09:21.490
in the slavish mentality, accepted it blindfolded

09:21.691 --> 09:25.179
without knowing how much knowledge and science we had.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.179
We had aeroplanes in our country.

09:27.393 --> 09:29.374
We had pilotless bombs in our country.

09:29.593 --> 09:32.460
We had all kinds of things in our country.

09:33.718 --> 09:40.723
But, why did we accept this without going into the roots

09:40.924 --> 09:44.629
to find out how did we have these things?

09:44.830 --> 09:48.031
We started doubting all that was the past in India,

09:48.232 --> 09:50.271
and we would not go into the past of it

09:50.472 --> 09:55.339
but we started moving downward with this western culture.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.240
And that’s the downfall of our country.

09:59.441 --> 10:02.294
That has brought all this nonsense here.

10:03.223 --> 10:06.750
When money becomes everything, the money orientation,

10:06.958 --> 10:08.497
the economics of it.

10:09.864 --> 10:13.524
This was the country of philosophers, of the seers,

10:13.725 --> 10:17.464
of the saints, where now today economics is dominating

10:17.665 --> 10:20.463
without understanding that you cannot put this western

10:20.664 --> 10:24.397
economics in this country at all, we cannot work it out.

10:25.694 --> 10:28.587
This is a country of generosity.

10:28.788 --> 10:31.289
People love to serve you, people love to do;

10:31.490 --> 10:34.239
even today they like to do something for you.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.719
Go to a village, even if they may not have anything with them,

10:37.920 --> 10:39.946
they’ll bring some milk; make you sit there.

10:40.147 --> 10:42.779
“Please have some milk. You have come from foreign countries,

10:43.006 --> 10:46.139
please have it.” But in the western countries:

10:46.358 --> 10:48.834
you may give them any amount of things,

10:49.045 --> 10:51.693
they won’t even return one present to you.

10:51.927 --> 10:53.761
Shamelessly they’ll take everything thinking

10:53.962 --> 10:55.922
that they are the ones who should have it.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.159
They have no subtleties.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.362
They have no subtleties to understand generosity, they cannot.

11:03.519 --> 11:06.919
They think we do it because we are slavish people.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.724
Even I was surprised when the some villagers told Me

11:11.925 --> 11:16.338
that even the animals coming from the West are stupid.

11:17.799 --> 11:22.424
I said, “how?” He said, “Now take a hen from India

11:22.627 --> 11:28.193
and take a leghorn or rooster from western countries.

11:28.394 --> 11:32.901
If there is an attack on the little chicks,

11:33.612 --> 11:36.634
the mother will start shouting or doing something,

11:36.835 --> 11:40.334
screaming or doing something to call all her children

11:40.554 --> 11:42.999
under her wings - if it’s an Indian hen.

11:43.257 --> 11:44.673
But if it’s an English hen, she wouldn’t mind.

11:44.874 --> 11:46.858
She would look at everything very peacefully,

11:47.038 --> 11:52.970
stithapragya, not bothered.” Then he said,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.561
“Most surprising thing is that our bullocks,

11:55.762 --> 11:59.639
if you tell them go this way, that way, they understand.

11:59.840 --> 12:03.059
But if you tell a western bullock,

12:03.260 --> 12:06.025
he walks straight into the car, into the trucks;

12:06.198 --> 12:10.044
he doesn’t know where he is walking. He has no idea.

12:10.245 --> 12:11.544
You cannot leave them alone.

12:11.745 --> 12:12.776
And if you tell them walk this way,

12:12.977 --> 12:15.377
they will walk the other way round.”

12:15.696 --> 12:17.995
So what is in this culture?

12:18.196 --> 12:27.075
What is in this whole upbringing that makes you so gross?

12:27.434 --> 12:31.728
The attention is on the matter and not on the spirit.

12:31.963 --> 12:37.541
All the time the matter is trying to overpower the spirit.

12:38.362 --> 12:42.548
Supposing there is a tree that falls off, it dies,

12:42.749 --> 12:46.655
then you make a chair out of it. It’s a dead from the dead.

12:46.858 --> 12:50.665
Now you sit on the chair and you become a slave of the chair.

12:50.866 --> 12:53.391
You cannot sit on the ground.

12:53.592 --> 12:56.162
Then you have to carry chairs with you.

12:57.647 --> 12:59.781
If you start moving in a car,

12:59.982 --> 13:05.469
you become so useless that you cannot walk with your legs.

13:06.532 --> 13:09.132
Tomorrow you start having calculators…

13:09.391 --> 13:10.745
you’ll be surprised, I live in London

13:10.946 --> 13:12.733
I am amazed at the people.

13:12.929 --> 13:17.129
Even if they have to do two plus two they want their tambaaku.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.827
They want to calculate it.

13:20.038 --> 13:21.666
For two plus two they cannot do it,

13:21.867 --> 13:24.781
they have no brains left because computers have come.

13:25.039 --> 13:27.690
So as a result of this machinery,

13:27.891 --> 13:32.166
the machines that have created… We say the “machine age”

13:32.370 --> 13:36.645
what an age it is - and the age of development.

13:36.846 --> 13:41.698
Without any control if the machines have

13:42.902 --> 13:46.904
gone up to this point, it is time that we understand

13:47.105 --> 13:49.933
we should not go too much towards it,

13:50.153 --> 13:52.753
that we become slaves of this machine.

13:53.012 --> 13:55.545
The machine is like a devil.

13:55.746 --> 14:01.708
It requires, like a devil, all the time to eat something.

14:01.951 --> 14:07.404
Like, you… in England it’s impossible to get fresh food.

14:07.605 --> 14:09.675
You have to go to the main market to get it.

14:09.878 --> 14:12.740
But in America, is even worse

14:12.948 --> 14:16.623
and in most of the countries they have everything packed,

14:16.824 --> 14:20.326
everything in a plastic bag, everything measured.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.206
You go to the shop, you get this, this, this, this… nothing fresh.

14:24.407 --> 14:28.242
There’s no taste in the food. Now they are using chemicals.

14:28.462 --> 14:31.594
They put chemicals in the body of the animals, which they eat;

14:31.776 --> 14:33.934
put chemicals in the foods that they eat;

14:34.135 --> 14:38.588
put chemicals because the machine must have a quantity.

14:38.839 --> 14:41.114
To have the quantity they have to do all this.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.323
So what you are taking is all this chemicals.

14:43.524 --> 14:44.461
As a result of that,

14:44.633 --> 14:48.870
what you are developing is nothing else but your destruction

14:49.071 --> 14:53.320
So all this attention outside, into the matter,

14:53.524 --> 14:57.141
builds up your destructions gradually.

14:58.227 --> 15:01.872
The attention gets fragmented.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.570
For example, you are talking to someone…

15:03.771 --> 15:06.007
this is a very modern stuff, I have seen many.

15:06.208 --> 15:09.796
You are talking to someone and this person is looking somewhere else.

15:10.005 --> 15:10.910
“Where are you looking?”

15:11.090 --> 15:16.913
“Oh, I was looking at that picture or something.

15:17.114 --> 15:18.342
I think I should buy that.”

15:18.543 --> 15:22.230
But I am talking to you here - doesn’t go into the head. Nothing.

15:22.450 --> 15:25.301
He is looking at something, or at some woman,

15:25.481 --> 15:29.414
or at some man - which is joyless pursuit.

15:29.615 --> 15:34.724
We have nothing to do with it and there is no alertness,

15:34.982 --> 15:38.192
which picks up things at the right moment.

15:38.393 --> 15:40.419
Then another thing a gentleman told Me,

15:40.620 --> 15:42.533
whose four children are in an English school

15:42.721 --> 15:45.054
and one child in an Indian school.

15:45.221 --> 15:49.012
He says these four children don’t talk much.

15:49.213 --> 15:52.403
They think no end of themselves and they don’t know.

15:52.604 --> 15:58.348
You ask them how many roads there are to your house?

15:58.549 --> 15:59.744
They wouldn’t know.

15:59.927 --> 16:04.726
They just go like a blinkers of a horse around their heads.

16:04.927 --> 16:07.205
They walk like that. They don’t know anything.

16:07.406 --> 16:09.009
They don’t read newspapers;

16:09.210 --> 16:10.877
they have no ideas as to what things we have.

16:11.078 --> 16:14.804
The youngest child, who is brought up in an Indian way

16:14.977 --> 16:17.820
and in an Indian school, has got a little parrot,

16:18.008 --> 16:22.205
has got a little doggy, has… looks after all the cows.

16:22.406 --> 16:27.775
He gives all the news about all the animals in the house.

16:27.976 --> 16:29.960
He gives all the news about the relations.

16:30.164 --> 16:32.861
He knows who are the relations, who are suffering,

16:33.062 --> 16:36.226
what is the problem. What in the kitchen is needed?

16:36.427 --> 16:39.158
He is so alert, his attention is so alert

16:39.359 --> 16:41.171
because it is not fragmented.

16:44.585 --> 16:46.072
Now with any convenience,

16:46.273 --> 16:49.265
we want to put our children into English schools.

16:49.499 --> 16:52.142
I tell you, you’ll have it.

16:52.343 --> 16:54.418
If they don’t beat you when they grow up,

16:54.619 --> 16:56.645
you shouldn’t be surprised. I’ve seen

16:56.846 --> 16:59.470
western children beat their parents.

17:01.446 --> 17:02.473
They answer them back.

17:02.674 --> 17:05.919
It was a day when the children of a good family

17:06.120 --> 17:11.049
would always address their parents as sir or mother as a madam.

17:11.284 --> 17:15.047
But today, I have seen them answering them back

17:15.248 --> 17:17.216
saying all kinds of funny things

17:17.436 --> 17:19.451
and knowing all the filth of the world,

17:19.592 --> 17:21.586
all the filth of the world.

17:21.787 --> 17:24.624
They know so much of filth that you are shocked;

17:24.859 --> 17:26.627
you don’t know that.

17:26.828 --> 17:29.752
And the whole attitude of all their medias,

17:29.953 --> 17:32.835
or ours also I should say, in a way,

17:33.141 --> 17:35.319
is to create that attitude,

17:35.520 --> 17:38.092
to put our children into that filth all the time,

17:38.293 --> 17:39.988
take them to that filth.

17:41.293 --> 17:44.387
Our people also - I see in the television, here also

17:44.616 --> 17:47.860
they show all these horribly nude

17:48.061 --> 17:49.692
funny women in the advertisement.

17:49.892 --> 17:53.238
Because these advertisements, and the medias also,

17:53.439 --> 17:56.946
work out your attention onto the gross.

17:57.158 --> 18:00.441
They play on your weaknesses.

18:00.642 --> 18:04.140
That’s how they make you weak, and when you become weak,

18:04.336 --> 18:06.069
weak, they become very powerful.

18:06.257 --> 18:09.857
When the media is so powerful, you can’t do anything.

18:10.101 --> 18:15.343
There is no purity in their hearts to do benevolence,

18:15.544 --> 18:17.919
to do good to the people - as we call janahith.

18:18.138 --> 18:22.242
That’s not in their mind at all. Somehow to make money.

18:22.443 --> 18:24.643
What’s the harm in making money?

18:25.254 --> 18:28.428
It’s surprising how people are compromising

18:28.629 --> 18:32.410
for the sake of money. Money doesn’t give you joy.

18:32.629 --> 18:35.027
I have to tell you it cannot give you joy.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.772
Don’t run after money.

18:37.012 --> 18:41.194
Have a integrated attitude towards money.

18:41.395 --> 18:43.871
Money is the blessing of the Lakshmi,

18:44.074 --> 18:47.701
and the Lakshmi is a very beautiful woman

18:47.902 --> 18:54.261
who has got a very motherly attitude. She is the Mother.

18:54.512 --> 18:59.222
A man who has money has to have motherly attitude.

18:59.754 --> 19:03.207
She has got two lotuses in Her hands;

19:03.408 --> 19:05.705
pink shows that She is love.

19:05.916 --> 19:08.879
She expresses Her love in two of Her hands

19:09.080 --> 19:11.767
which also means a lotus which is pink,

19:12.010 --> 19:19.824
is even entertaining a thorny bhavraa, we call it

19:20.025 --> 19:24.035
the black big beetle, which has got thorns

19:24.236 --> 19:30.145
on its soft petals and gives it a place of rest.

19:30.408 --> 19:32.960
How many of these rich people in this country,

19:33.161 --> 19:37.461
and specially abroad, would entertain such an idea

19:37.696 --> 19:41.407
of having a place for a ashrayaa,

19:41.608 --> 19:46.711
for a support for the persons who are like a bhavraa.

19:50.181 --> 19:57.363
Then, the other hand, which is like this, has to be daan.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.009
You have to give, if you have money you must give.

20:00.181 --> 20:02.618
How many of them know where to give money?

20:02.819 --> 20:04.514
They’ll give money to places

20:04.715 --> 20:08.178
where people will cheat them - like Rajneesh.

20:09.546 --> 20:12.556
They’ll not give money to the poor.

20:12.757 --> 20:16.585
They’ll not develop anything for the poor in a proper way.

20:16.819 --> 20:18.837
The other day, I was surprised, I went to Poona.

20:19.038 --> 20:22.548
We have there a very good thing system started

20:22.756 --> 20:26.225
of called as JanaShanti where people give food

20:26.426 --> 20:29.496
for two rupees, very good food for one, one meal,

20:29.708 --> 20:33.137
very very good food, excellent food they give and sufficient

20:33.366 --> 20:37.772
for two rupees. And they said all the, President downward,

20:37.973 --> 20:40.801
people came here; we had to spend money on their reception.

20:41.009 --> 20:42.681
We gave them this that, garland,

20:42.877 --> 20:46.010
this that and everybody gave big big lectures.

20:47.182 --> 20:51.431
And nobody is willing to even give them a place on rent.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.858
No one wants them there

20:53.093 --> 20:55.749
because they think you will go into competition

20:55.977 --> 20:59.147
with others who are making profits and will not get votes.

20:59.366 --> 21:02.795
So the whole system is so funny

21:02.996 --> 21:04.810
that you end up at a point that

21:05.011 --> 21:07.042
they want to give money because they want to have votes.

21:07.253 --> 21:10.831
They want to win the election because they want to make money.

21:11.081 --> 21:13.926
I mean, I came to this country and everybody is saying,

21:14.127 --> 21:16.837
“What’s the matter, why can’t we get the plot?”

21:17.041 --> 21:18.955
Because the person wants to eat the money;

21:19.143 --> 21:22.012
here everybody eats the money,

21:22.213 --> 21:24.714
eating the money, paishe khaato.

21:24.934 --> 21:27.410
Te paishe khata, te paishe khata, te paishe khata.

21:27.668 --> 21:31.511
Say, don’t they eat their food, or why are they eating money?

21:31.699 --> 21:34.266
This is the trouble of this country has come because money

21:34.467 --> 21:37.544
has become the most important thing for them.

21:37.826 --> 21:42.117
Nothing that they think that this body, this being,

21:42.318 --> 21:46.438
this is a collective being. This is the samoohik being.

21:46.665 --> 21:49.737
It cannot be happy with this kind of a harm

21:49.938 --> 21:51.352
we are doing to our society.

21:51.553 --> 21:53.768
All those who do things like this,

21:53.969 --> 21:57.024
their seven generations will be cursed by God.

21:57.569 --> 21:58.491
You must understand:

21:58.702 --> 22:01.795
those who make money at the cost of the poor people,

22:01.999 --> 22:03.932
they will be cursed forever.

22:04.163 --> 22:07.552
And one should not join such people,

22:07.753 --> 22:09.603
even if you have to suffer.

22:09.845 --> 22:13.905
I know it’s very hard time, people cannot afford

22:14.106 --> 22:17.994
to live with the earnings they have. But still, if you decide,

22:18.238 --> 22:22.010
you can live with the satisfaction that you have done right.

22:22.221 --> 22:25.517
When My father was…

22:28.191 --> 22:31.323
and My mother, both were in jail so many times.

22:31.534 --> 22:32.300
We were eleven children.

22:32.501 --> 22:34.977
We were very rich people living in huts.

22:35.290 --> 22:38.487
And we didn’t have food for days together sometimes.

22:38.688 --> 22:40.758
And we have… were used to very rich life.

22:40.969 --> 22:44.508
They sacrificed everything for the country’s freedom.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.211
Where are such people now? You can’t think of them.

22:47.430 --> 22:48.399
They are legendary people.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.454
Nobody wants to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

22:52.655 --> 22:54.493
And this is the movement;

22:54.694 --> 22:58.311
this is a new movement of swatantra.

22:58.512 --> 23:02.084
Swaatantrya is not yet complete; you can see it clearly.

23:02.285 --> 23:04.676
It is not. Your freedom is not complete.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.676
If your freedom has to be complete,

23:06.911 --> 23:09.561
you must get your swatantra;

23:09.762 --> 23:14.636
you must know the technique of your swa, of your spirit.

23:14.887 --> 23:17.543
Unless and until you get this full freedom,

23:17.754 --> 23:20.730
you are not free people. You are slaves of money.

23:20.931 --> 23:25.685
You are slaves of powers. You are slaves of showing off.

23:25.886 --> 23:30.748
You are slaves of everything, to Me. All kinds of bad habits.

23:30.949 --> 23:34.566
I’ve never known so many drunkards that we find these days.

23:34.886 --> 23:38.370
So we have become greater slaves of all the bad habits,

23:38.582 --> 23:43.041
all the bad doings. And there is nothing

23:43.242 --> 23:48.375
that a person in a big position can think of not doing.

23:50.359 --> 23:51.526
Why it has happened to us?

23:51.727 --> 23:57.252
Why have we all collapsed into such insipid useless people?

23:57.453 --> 24:00.374
What has happened to our countrymen? Is this:

24:00.570 --> 24:02.343
that they have not realized

24:02.562 --> 24:09.322
that the greatest thing is in the brain. Is the roots,

24:09.523 --> 24:13.992
and these roots are in this country, in this Maharastra.

24:14.266 --> 24:19.418
These roots are here. The Kundalini has to only enlighten these roots,

24:19.622 --> 24:23.161
and we never bothered about it. We never cared for it.

24:23.403 --> 24:27.136
We are all the time worried as to how to get more money.

24:27.429 --> 24:29.522
So the people who are highly paid

24:29.749 --> 24:33.201
or who are at a higher position with less pay, also maybe,

24:33.499 --> 24:36.032
they are making money by eating that.

24:36.304 --> 24:38.158
And the others are a sort of people

24:38.359 --> 24:41.319
who are going on strike for everything. For what?

24:41.484 --> 24:43.619
For money, again for money.

24:43.820 --> 24:47.083
This Bombay is half finished because of strikes.

24:47.284 --> 24:50.154
What for strikes? I asked them. You are a drunkard?

24:50.355 --> 24:52.839
Yes. You drink? All right. And you smoke? Yes.

24:53.050 --> 24:55.388
You eat tambaaku? Yes. You eat paan.

24:55.589 --> 24:57.690
That means you have money.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.487
Otherwise how can you afford all these things?

25:00.738 --> 25:03.471
When you ask for more money in a strike,

25:03.707 --> 25:06.035
better find out what sort of a man he is.

25:06.269 --> 25:07.531
If he can drink, afford to drink,

25:07.732 --> 25:10.325
then you need not give him any money to drink more.

25:10.545 --> 25:12.927
Any mother who sees her son is drinking,

25:13.128 --> 25:14.232
will never give him any money

25:14.443 --> 25:15.924
because he will be drinking with that money.

25:16.125 --> 25:19.807
What else is he going to do? What good is he going to do with that?

25:20.008 --> 25:22.080
So what happens is that this attention,

25:22.281 --> 25:24.734
when it starts moving towards money,

25:24.938 --> 25:27.990
we become so blind that we do not see why,

25:28.191 --> 25:34.381
why are we asking for money. What is the need for money?

25:34.582 --> 25:36.265
I am not for these capitalists at all.

25:36.466 --> 25:38.310
I know how horrid they are.

25:38.511 --> 25:42.612
But what I’m saying that why break the machinery like this.

25:42.870 --> 25:44.537
Now whatever you may do,

25:44.802 --> 25:47.368
whatever you may tell them that finish this striking

25:47.569 --> 25:51.022
and enjoy yourself now, for the God sake.

25:51.296 --> 25:55.229
We have really poor people in the villages, not in Bombay.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.028
In Bombay we don’t have poor people.

25:57.229 --> 25:59.596
They can go to cinema; they can do all kinds of things.

25:59.862 --> 26:03.294
How can they be poor? But they have time.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.268
They have more time. That’s why they get…

26:05.469 --> 26:06.362
enter into such things.

26:06.563 --> 26:10.635
And they are going to finish this Mumbai of yours

26:10.836 --> 26:12.938
very soon if you allow these people to go on strike.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.467
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity

26:15.701 --> 26:19.834
and it come from the western people - it’s not from Gandhiji.

26:20.427 --> 26:23.960
Gandhiji didn’t tell you to fight for money. Did he?

26:24.192 --> 26:26.792
He asked you to fight for swaatantrya.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.692
And today if he was living,

26:28.934 --> 26:32.192
he would have talked about Sahaja Yoga, I am sure of that.

26:32.497 --> 26:35.661
But the problem that exists with us is that

26:35.862 --> 26:40.752
we don’t want to see that this machinery is now shaking.

26:41.081 --> 26:42.846
We have to have another system,

26:43.010 --> 26:47.009
a parallel system that will crush this stupid machinery,

26:47.210 --> 26:51.139
which is taking us downward and downward and downward.

26:52.061 --> 26:54.373
A girl must have ten types of sarees,

26:54.593 --> 26:57.535
ten types of clothes she must wear, like a Kashmiri girl;

26:57.736 --> 26:59.027
she must wear like a Punjabi girl;

26:59.228 --> 27:01.066
she must wear like an English girl.

27:01.267 --> 27:03.644
What is the need? I mean, we used to have…

27:03.853 --> 27:05.574
we are rich people, I should… very rich,

27:05.775 --> 27:06.860
we used to have only two sarees.

27:07.064 --> 27:08.871
And one for - thevni as they call it -

27:09.072 --> 27:12.146
one for some special occasions. And we lived well,

27:12.347 --> 27:15.511
we educated well where attention was learning

27:15.733 --> 27:18.370
and attention was towards God.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.672
But the attention, when it gets lost it fritters away.

27:23.993 --> 27:25.560
It gets lost. It gets fragmented.

27:25.761 --> 27:28.151
There’s no continuity in it. It fritters away

27:28.339 --> 27:30.794
and a person becomes a superficial person,

27:30.995 --> 27:34.893
extremely superficial. He cannot go deep.

27:35.167 --> 27:39.748
How can he feel his spirit? The superficiality makes you,

27:39.949 --> 27:45.446
absolutely, a person who has sort of a crust

27:45.649 --> 27:51.433
and nothing inside, absolutely what we call the hollowness,

27:51.634 --> 27:56.134
kokhlapan, completely hollow. If you just break that man,

27:56.353 --> 27:58.621
you find out he is not a man of character.

27:58.822 --> 28:00.805
He is not a man to be dependant upon.

28:01.025 --> 28:03.110
He is not a man who talks good of others.

28:03.322 --> 28:06.876
He will try to pull you down. This is what happens to your attention

28:07.101 --> 28:14.237
and you become extremely, extremely low-level human being.

28:14.438 --> 28:17.797
You’ll be surprised I went to four villages before coming here

28:18.133 --> 28:23.087
and the people who were there were five times more than Bombay people.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.620
They came, they didn’t have cars, nothing;

28:25.878 --> 28:30.833
they didn’t have buses. They came walking. They came on bullock carts.

28:31.034 --> 28:35.508
And such a big crowd and all of them got realization

28:35.709 --> 28:39.309
because, thank God, they don’t know English language.

28:39.937 --> 28:45.177
And these nonsensical ideas that we have got from the western culture.

28:45.662 --> 28:49.458
We are not to compete with them. They have to compete with us.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.904
They have nothing to offer you.

28:52.677 --> 28:55.748
You have to stick onto your ideal. But instead of that,

28:55.964 --> 28:57.417
we have learnt all the bad things,

28:57.628 --> 29:00.221
and all the bad traditions like taking dowry,

29:00.456 --> 29:03.983
torturing our women and doing all these things,

29:04.218 --> 29:08.131
which do not at all look civil.

29:09.421 --> 29:12.335
In that we are not modern. In that we are not modern;

29:12.530 --> 29:16.032
in that we are very very primitive.

29:16.233 --> 29:19.664
But it was never so before. Nobody used to torture wives.

29:19.836 --> 29:22.875
We never knew there was a dowry system in India.

29:23.117 --> 29:24.057
Nobody knew it.

29:24.258 --> 29:26.617
It is absolutely something we cannot understand

29:26.859 --> 29:30.414
from where it came, and I discovered it came from the English only.

29:30.703 --> 29:34.176
Because they said we should be very,

29:34.377 --> 29:38.106
very balanced about our children.

29:38.307 --> 29:41.895
And we should not give only the money to the boy.

29:42.096 --> 29:44.588
They’ll just quarrel but we should give it to the girl also.

29:44.815 --> 29:48.283
Because, you see, the whole inheritance will go to the boys,

29:48.518 --> 29:50.923
the land will go to the boys, you must give some money.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.334
That was sensible but we have gone to the extremes now,

29:54.515 --> 29:57.233
and all these problems are coming before us,

29:57.434 --> 30:00.376
which we call as social problems.

30:00.577 --> 30:01.939
Then we have problems,

30:02.140 --> 30:06.623
which we call as emotional problems out of family problems.

30:07.694 --> 30:09.717
Now if you want to follow them

30:09.918 --> 30:11.503
then I would like to give you the picture

30:11.699 --> 30:13.566
how their family lives are.

30:13.746 --> 30:16.990
So that you’ll understand that you just stop

30:17.191 --> 30:20.227
having all those ideas into your heads.

30:20.477 --> 30:23.878
The family picture is like this:

30:24.079 --> 30:29.144
That a husband and wife get married, so called.

30:29.345 --> 30:34.341
Within say a year or so, they are divorced.

30:34.542 --> 30:40.046
Then in one lifetime they’ll have eight husbands and eight wives, at least.

30:40.929 --> 30:44.101
Then they all land up in the orphanage in old age.

30:44.312 --> 30:46.155
The children are in the orphanage.

30:46.399 --> 30:50.542
The father is in the orphanage and the mother is also in the orphanage.

30:50.743 --> 30:54.149
All the mothers, fathers, everybody ends up in orphanage.

30:54.415 --> 31:01.307
There is no love. There is no feeling in England itself,

31:01.508 --> 31:05.015
I was feeling, but it is only in London.

31:05.305 --> 31:09.058
Two children are killed by their parents.

31:09.259 --> 31:12.769
There’s no compassion. There’s no daya.

31:12.970 --> 31:14.314
There’s no karuna in them.

31:14.548 --> 31:17.722
And that’s what today happening to us also.

31:17.923 --> 31:19.720
Our children are going the same way.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.378
Our parents are going the same way.

31:22.627 --> 31:26.439
So as My mother always used to say, “lakshya kuthe?”

31:26.640 --> 31:29.936
where’s your attention? Where is your attention?

31:30.671 --> 31:33.249
So you would say that no, my attention is nowhere.

31:33.437 --> 31:35.733
Nowhere means what? Should be on God.

31:35.960 --> 31:40.235
Where is your attention? Should be on God.

31:40.436 --> 31:43.149
Devaa kade lakshya thevaa. Keep attention towards God.

31:43.350 --> 31:45.161
Where is your attention?

31:45.362 --> 31:47.326
Even when they taught music they used to say,

31:47.499 --> 31:52.368
“first think of God.” Anything they did, think of God.

31:52.569 --> 31:54.368
When you think of God,

31:54.569 --> 31:59.571
you don’t think of other nonsensical things but sensible things.

31:59.772 --> 32:02.581
And that is how our… our attention frittered away

32:02.782 --> 32:04.713
because when the attention comes out

32:04.914 --> 32:14.226
it attacks the modern, because there’s a challenge.

32:14.427 --> 32:18.258
As a result of that fight the attention breaks into fragments.

32:18.459 --> 32:20.281
There is no... Fragmentation is there.

32:20.482 --> 32:21.742
Your attention is not collected.

32:21.943 --> 32:23.748
You don’t know where you are, where you are moving.

32:23.949 --> 32:25.648
You can’t see anything; you don’t understand.

32:25.849 --> 32:27.639
You ask them one question, they don’t know.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.419
They’ve forgotten. What is your father’s name?

32:29.620 --> 32:32.393
“No, I don’t know what’s my father’s name”.

32:35.308 --> 32:38.638
This is the situation, which they are facing.

32:38.839 --> 32:44.198
You have no idea as to what hell they are living into.

32:44.399 --> 32:49.622
And if you want to take yourself and your children to that hell, follow them.

32:51.490 --> 32:54.278
But it doesn’t mean that you go to these bhajjis

32:54.493 --> 32:56.906
and give them money, or go to these horrible gurus.

32:57.107 --> 33:01.750
It doesn’t mean that either. It never means that.

33:01.951 --> 33:03.125
You avoid that nonsense

33:03.326 --> 33:05.880
because your parents were stupid to go to these gurus.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.458
These have started only hundred years back.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.013
We have never known such people.

33:10.216 --> 33:11.614
Before, these bhondoos we never knew.

33:11.834 --> 33:14.482
Hundred years back nobody talks except for Nanaka,

33:14.701 --> 33:16.998
who has said it that these bhondoos must be avoided.

33:17.199 --> 33:19.498
“Sadguru che lakshan he” and all these things

33:19.699 --> 33:23.826
have been written by Ramdaasa. But who reads Ramdaas?

33:24.027 --> 33:26.271
Because he was a Brahmin, non-Brahmins won’t read.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.628
Who will read Tukharaama? Because he was a non-Brahmin,

33:28.829 --> 33:33.693
Brahmins won’t read it. If their caste is such a big thing,

33:33.894 --> 33:37.647
that by reading something it falls off, better give it up.

33:37.835 --> 33:39.514
All these caste systems

33:39.749 --> 33:42.970
and all these are now so much settled into our heads.

33:43.171 --> 33:45.640
So much settled; it was never so before.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.330
It’s very surprising.

33:48.531 --> 33:51.397
And in the early times there was no caste system.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.127
There was a caste system according to your karmas,

33:54.328 --> 33:58.084
according to your doings, not according to where you are born.

33:58.292 --> 34:02.440
Otherwise, how could Valmiki be called a brahma rishi?

34:02.675 --> 34:06.798
And how could Vyasa, who was an illegitimate child

34:06.999 --> 34:12.066
of a fisherwoman, could be called as the greatest of greatest?

34:14.785 --> 34:17.998
All these false ideas have to fall out,

34:18.199 --> 34:20.722
and for that we have to start a new system.

34:20.954 --> 34:24.217
And a new system has to come forward through the people

34:24.418 --> 34:26.928
who have achieved their yoga.

34:27.129 --> 34:29.225
Shri Krishna Himself has clearly said,

34:29.433 --> 34:32.339
“yogakshema vahamyaham” - when you get your yoga,

34:32.520 --> 34:36.780
you will get kshema. Always He has said about yogis.

34:36.981 --> 34:39.290
He has used the word yogis for that.

34:39.470 --> 34:41.243
These yogis have to come that,

34:41.444 --> 34:43.110
and as you have read in the Pasaydaan just now

34:43.311 --> 34:47.545
you have heard about it that the forests,

34:47.772 --> 34:54.493
forests of these great people who are kalpatarus,

34:54.694 --> 34:59.126
who are the givers of your desires, will be walking.

34:59.327 --> 35:01.874
These are the yogis.

35:02.132 --> 35:07.194
And the oceans of this talking nectar

35:07.656 --> 35:13.699
will be talking about God. These are the yogis.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.189
Others are all ordinary useless people,

35:16.390 --> 35:17.944
will be frittered away.

35:18.179 --> 35:21.219
Only the yogis will be respected in the kingdom of God.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.288
And we have to bring the kingdom of God on this earth.

35:24.499 --> 35:29.302
First in India, then everywhere. Here it is going to come.

35:29.503 --> 35:35.612
Now people might say Marxism, this ism, that ism.

35:36.456 --> 35:43.222
Tukaraama has said ava ghaachi samsaara sukha cha kari.

35:43.423 --> 35:46.508
He said it. Same - Marx says the same.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.927
He says that the whole world should be so…

35:49.123 --> 35:52.305
such a happy place, such a happy place

35:52.506 --> 35:56.306
that there should be no state.

35:56.714 --> 36:01.693
How? Nobody asked him how. He talks of evolution. How?

36:01.894 --> 36:04.593
How the evolution is going to take place? Ask him.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.327
Ask all these communists.

36:06.523 --> 36:09.054
They are not becoming better people. Are they?

36:09.273 --> 36:10.873
Who is becoming better?

36:11.140 --> 36:14.421
Who is getting transformed by that Isms? None of them.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.585
Somebody is a disciple of this gentleman.

36:16.793 --> 36:18.359
Somebody is a disciple of that gentleman.

36:18.598 --> 36:21.625
Somebody is following this kind of a political theory.

36:21.826 --> 36:24.568
Another following that kind of a theory. It’s a theory.

36:24.769 --> 36:28.161
In Marathi as they say, “bhola cha tsa baata bhola chi tsa kari”.

36:28.414 --> 36:29.458
Whatever theories you have,

36:29.659 --> 36:30.994
you have written down on your heads.

36:31.175 --> 36:34.935
Are you going to get transformation with that?

36:35.136 --> 36:38.073
There has to, something, happen within you.

36:38.268 --> 36:41.911
If you have to get to that point what Marx has said,

36:42.112 --> 36:44.271
what Tukaraama has said.

36:44.472 --> 36:48.568
This parivarthan, this change, this transformation has to take place

36:48.795 --> 36:52.662
and that’s only possible through the Kundalini awakening.

36:53.475 --> 36:55.146
There are people who have read about Kundalini.

36:55.381 --> 36:56.365
They come and ask Me,

36:56.566 --> 36:58.857
“Mother this Kundalini that You are talking about,

36:59.045 --> 37:01.045
people say that this Kundalini can give us madness, this that.”

37:03.637 --> 37:05.592
Even they have said that six,

37:05.793 --> 37:09.199
sixth chapter of Gynaneshwari should not be read at all

37:09.426 --> 37:11.394
7because it deals with Kundalini.

37:11.598 --> 37:13.445
Naturally - because they don’t know anything about it.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.625
So it is better not to deal with it.

37:15.844 --> 37:20.846
But Kundalini is the shuddha iccha, is the real icchaa,

37:21.047 --> 37:22.985
is the one that is going to give you

37:23.186 --> 37:25.935
that what you are born for, is going to give you.

37:26.139 --> 37:30.618
After that you do not want anything else.

37:30.819 --> 37:33.924
It’s not like the economics that you want today this,

37:34.125 --> 37:38.041
tomorrow that and it is never satiable in general.

37:38.242 --> 37:41.197
It gets completely…

37:41.405 --> 37:47.551
the thing that you want is the entire source of satisfaction.

37:47.752 --> 37:50.317
But is the movement is upward;

37:50.536 --> 37:54.082
the Kundalini doesn’t go downward towards the gravity,

37:54.294 --> 37:56.778
towards the matter.

37:57.864 --> 38:04.679
It comes up. It moves upward and pierces through this

38:04.880 --> 38:08.905
fontanelle bone area and you get your self-realization.

38:09.106 --> 38:11.882
This is what you should ask from any guru.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.973
All the rest of it is useless. How can you pay for it?

38:15.169 --> 38:18.327
Can you show rupee to that Kundalini?

38:18.528 --> 38:21.874
It’s a living process of the living evolution,

38:22.075 --> 38:23.075
which has to take place.

38:23.263 --> 38:26.863
You have to achieve the epitome of your life by this.

38:27.052 --> 38:28.421
How are you going to do it?

38:28.622 --> 38:31.668
Are you going to do it by standing on your head?

38:31.888 --> 38:34.346
Any living process like a sprouting of a seed,

38:34.547 --> 38:37.455
how do you do it? You put the seed in the Mother Earth.

38:37.656 --> 38:41.190
And She has the power and She just sprouts it.

38:41.391 --> 38:44.351
In the same way it has to happen that it should sprout.

38:44.564 --> 38:49.205
In that same manner it should sprout spontaneously.

38:49.406 --> 38:52.473
Sahaj. Saha – with, ja - born.

38:52.674 --> 38:58.134
This is born with you. To get this yoga is your birthright.

38:58.346 --> 39:01.832
Get it, and for Indians it’s a special blessing

39:02.033 --> 39:04.935
that they get it very fast. Just like their independence,

39:05.136 --> 39:08.136
without any effort. Without much struggle, I should say.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.425
Others have struggled much more than us.

39:10.643 --> 39:15.349
When you get that you also loose it very fast.

39:15.550 --> 39:20.541
So those people who understand Kundalini

39:20.742 --> 39:23.351
understand the essence of everything

39:23.547 --> 39:28.721
and they understand that all the religions are on one essence.

39:28.922 --> 39:32.200
They are the flowers of the same tree.

39:32.428 --> 39:34.344
Stupidly we are fighting here.

39:34.545 --> 39:41.161
Christ has said those who are not against us are with us.

39:41.362 --> 39:43.809
Who are those? Christians don’t want to find out.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.931
Now they are after Christ’s life.

39:47.158 --> 39:49.558
Hindus don’t want to know about it.

39:49.807 --> 39:53.093
There is no greatness of art. I would say now,

39:53.294 --> 39:58.590
there was a problem in Aurangabad and the people attacked.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.598
They should not have attacked. All right.

40:00.770 --> 40:04.437
But we have to understand what has happened in this one,

40:04.638 --> 40:08.437
where we have gone wrong. We should see our mistake.

40:08.638 --> 40:12.012
In a masjid, whatever it is, it’s a God place.

40:12.247 --> 40:15.910
It’s a God’s place, and in a masjid if they are meditating,

40:16.075 --> 40:19.516
you should not make noise. If you are insulting that,

40:19.717 --> 40:22.537
you are insulting Vittala Himself.

40:24.372 --> 40:26.602
In the Vittala mandir you have a different type of aarti,

40:26.803 --> 40:30.449
all right, have it. In that aarti if somebody starts

40:30.650 --> 40:35.910
doing discotheque dance, how will you like it?

40:37.641 --> 40:40.774
In the same way if that is a place of ibaadat,

40:41.027 --> 40:44.412
is a place where people are praying in a dhyana.

40:44.613 --> 40:47.706
Just now we are so quiet, we are sitting in the

40:47.917 --> 40:54.456
surrounding horrible noises, but everything is quiet.

40:54.657 --> 40:56.105
That’s why we are enjoying.

40:56.306 --> 41:00.458
And if that is the way they want to meditate,

41:00.659 --> 41:02.670
must we go and disturb them

41:02.873 --> 41:05.896
for something that some boys are troubling and all that?

41:06.069 --> 41:09.002
Can’t we respect it? To show our greatness,

41:09.194 --> 41:12.349
khorpana, must we do that?

41:12.550 --> 41:15.042
Is it very important that at that time

41:15.243 --> 41:20.149
we should take these besura, betaala bands in front of that?

41:23.766 --> 41:28.122
Why don’t we see that we also must respect

41:28.323 --> 41:30.833
whatever is God, everywhere?

41:31.034 --> 41:32.650
This is the mistake we commit.

41:32.851 --> 41:36.189
In the name of religion we insult God Himself.

41:36.398 --> 41:39.064
When they say “Allah-O-Akbar”, they mean Virat,

41:39.265 --> 41:41.772
means Shri Krishna Itself. If you come to Sahaja yoga,

41:41.945 --> 41:43.952
you will know that they are all related to each other.

41:44.148 --> 41:47.548
That Mohammed Sahib was nothing (but) a maha medha.

41:48.321 --> 41:52.804
He was the Dattatreya Himself. This is the medha,

41:53.005 --> 41:55.606
and He is settled down there.

41:55.872 --> 41:58.911
I know He was given poison and He was tortured.

41:59.075 --> 42:02.586
And the same thing - when we do it by saying

42:02.787 --> 42:05.130
that Mohammed was wrong. He was not wrong.

42:05.326 --> 42:07.586
Who was wrong? Are the Muslims. Who was wrong?

42:07.787 --> 42:10.185
Is the Hindus. Who was wrong? Are the Christians.

42:10.386 --> 42:12.380
They are all against all these prophets,

42:12.583 --> 42:16.703
all these great incarnations and bringing bad name to them.

42:16.904 --> 42:22.068
Let us start understanding. Let us start respecting.

42:22.269 --> 42:26.307
Let us be great. Let us be noble.

42:26.533 --> 42:30.783
Let us be higher people of affection,

42:31.002 --> 42:34.127
compassion and understanding. Let us be those people.

42:34.330 --> 42:37.292
Let us start. Let us start a nucleus like that.

42:37.493 --> 42:39.072
If you can do it, we can

42:39.273 --> 42:42.715
make all those who have gone down also

42:42.915 --> 42:45.425
pull back all of them upward.

42:46.050 --> 42:48.788
It was built in this country - this system.

42:48.937 --> 42:53.244
Whole thing was built in this country that we should ascend.

42:53.445 --> 42:55.632
Very beautifully done longtime back

42:55.828 --> 43:00.189
but was lost in the deluge of modern life.

43:00.390 --> 43:04.051
So people should take to all the traditional things,

43:04.229 --> 43:06.715
which are beautiful, all the traditional games

43:06.864 --> 43:12.421
that are beautiful, all the traditions that give respect.

43:12.622 --> 43:14.300
If you loose the sense of respect,

43:14.501 --> 43:18.563
you have lost the humanity, absolutely hundred percent.

43:18.790 --> 43:20.454
If you do not know how to respect,

43:20.641 --> 43:23.339
you are not an Indian at all. You are not an Indian.

43:23.527 --> 43:28.459
Don’t call yourself an Indian. You must learn how to respect.

43:28.660 --> 43:32.489
Respect gives you greatness. It makes you humble

43:32.697 --> 43:37.637
like Tukharaama said,

43:37.838 --> 43:43.085
“anurenu uni thodkaa, tukha aakaashaye vadaa”.

43:43.304 --> 43:45.335
When he becomes smaller than anurenu

43:45.561 --> 43:48.689
then he becomes aakaashaye vadaa.

43:48.890 --> 43:52.439
In the vadaat tree the seed is so very small,

43:52.627 --> 43:54.931
if you see that, it’s a extremely small

43:55.138 --> 43:57.338
and the biggest tree it creates.

43:57.908 --> 44:02.175
Once Shastriji said that even the small thing can do great job.

44:02.410 --> 44:05.537
And that’s what we are seeing. That a small thing,

44:05.738 --> 44:07.683
only when you become humble,

44:07.910 --> 44:10.738
then the grace of God surrounds your humility,

44:10.939 --> 44:13.687
surrounds your personality. And you become

44:13.888 --> 44:18.844
really a personality that has authority of God.

44:19.045 --> 44:22.740
That is the greatness of God - in that humility it works,

44:22.936 --> 44:24.180
it just works.

44:24.381 --> 44:28.001
After realization, the attention becomes enlightened.

44:28.204 --> 44:31.482
By that attention, looking at people

44:31.683 --> 44:33.011
you can raise their Kundalini.

44:33.212 --> 44:36.071
Only looking at people you can cure them.

44:36.290 --> 44:39.110
All your powers are expressed in your attention

44:39.329 --> 44:42.488
and you don’t get lost in the matter.

44:42.689 --> 44:44.532
Then you become the Baadshah.

44:44.775 --> 44:49.417
Baadshah is a person who doesn’t mind anything;

44:49.618 --> 44:51.339
he doesn’t need anything.

44:51.540 --> 44:55.011
As you know, I am born in a rich family and

44:55.136 --> 44:59.662
My in-laws are also rich. My husband is rich and all that,

44:59.863 --> 45:02.347
but I can live there, I can sleep there.

45:02.542 --> 45:04.870
I have lived in the jungles. I have lived along the rivers.

45:05.071 --> 45:08.847
I have no problem because - why do I want anything?

45:09.003 --> 45:11.387
Nothing can dominate Me. You can sleep on the stones.

45:11.588 --> 45:12.611
You can do what you like.

45:12.783 --> 45:15.892
But that’s only possible when you become the yogi.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.892
When you become the yogi, you can do it.

45:18.057 --> 45:20.259
These four hundred people, who have come from abroad,

45:20.416 --> 45:22.798
come from very rich families, very good families.

45:22.999 --> 45:25.403
And they have got all the comforts that you can think of,

45:25.604 --> 45:30.093
but they want to live under the sky, near the river.

45:30.351 --> 45:34.007
They just don’t want to see the cement on top of their heads.

45:34.241 --> 45:38.247
They are so much, now, in the higher level

45:38.448 --> 45:40.971
that they don’t want to see anything that is gross.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.312
They want this mud.

45:44.501 --> 45:49.627
They want this beautiful clay of this country.

45:49.828 --> 45:54.080
Kya deshachi maati bokha lagait. Tithe baslaat tumhi.

45:54.322 --> 45:58.055
You are sitting on top of that; and what are you doing?

45:59.643 --> 46:05.200
Your attention, where is it? Where is your attention?

46:05.401 --> 46:08.994
You must keep your attention to God;

46:09.190 --> 46:12.434
and once that is there, you’ll become a yogi.

46:12.635 --> 46:15.286
And once you become the yogi,

46:15.487 --> 46:22.158
you will be in the realm of God, in the kingdom of heaven.

46:22.359 --> 46:24.151
When you’ll be blessed with everything

46:24.352 --> 46:26.625
you don’t have to desire. It will just before,

46:26.826 --> 46:31.133
you will not know how to contain all that God has given you,

46:31.334 --> 46:33.810
the kshema that He gives you. Apart from that,

46:33.990 --> 46:38.375
your attention itself will be such a powerful

46:38.576 --> 46:42.293
instrument that you can change the entire universe with that.

46:42.493 --> 46:45.426
Why I beg of you? - Because you are Indians.

46:45.719 --> 46:48.550
You are born in this country because of poorva sukrutaas,

46:48.777 --> 46:51.510
because what you have done in last life.

46:51.769 --> 46:54.574
That’s why you are born in this great country.

46:54.793 --> 46:58.660
But it’s like those who have teeth don’t have the chanas to eat,

46:58.861 --> 47:02.251
and those who don’t have teeth have got the chanas.

47:02.452 --> 47:05.319
It’s like that. The situation is very bad.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.967
You are the ones who can become the greatest yogis,

47:08.179 --> 47:10.300
but you do not. But the western people

47:10.501 --> 47:14.110
who do not have any idea about holiness,

47:14.311 --> 47:17.766
about auspiciousness, nothing they are so ignorant

47:17.978 --> 47:21.925
they shoot off much faster than you can.

47:22.149 --> 47:25.287
So I have to make a humble request to you that

47:25.468 --> 47:32.376
do not get enamored by this attention that goes to any matter.

47:32.577 --> 47:36.387
But matter itself is made by God.

47:37.669 --> 47:41.106
So despite the fact human beings got involved

47:41.310 --> 47:43.377
into the material advancement,

47:43.755 --> 47:47.254
it is today helping us in Sahaja yoga in a very great way.

47:47.435 --> 47:51.850
For example, this mic is important,

47:52.051 --> 47:54.350
is also useful for carrying My vibrations.

47:54.551 --> 47:59.334
It carries vibrations. Camera shows all the light around Me

47:59.535 --> 48:02.484
and shows all the kinds of forms I have.

48:02.685 --> 48:05.265
So whatever you may try,

48:05.466 --> 48:08.981
the Divine will sparkle through that matter also

48:09.185 --> 48:13.247
and will establish the existence of Divinity.

48:14.357 --> 48:18.382
But if you cut out the Divinity out of the matter,

48:18.583 --> 48:22.524
you will be hit hard and you’ll be submerged

48:22.719 --> 48:26.914
in the greater ocean of ignorance and filth.

48:27.665 --> 48:32.301
So keep Divinity at your heart and then deal with matter.

48:32.502 --> 48:36.361
And then you will understand what is the use of this matter,

48:36.510 --> 48:38.577
and what one has to do with it.

48:38.814 --> 48:42.862
Tomorrow, in Hindi, I will be talking about the rest of it

48:43.063 --> 48:50.870
about the truth because today I’ve talked about the Chit.

48:51.058 --> 48:52.823
Tomorrow I’ll be talking about the truth.

48:52.996 --> 48:56.810
Sat-Chit-Anand. And third day I’ll be talking

48:57.011 --> 48:59.813
about Anand to you in Marathi language.

49:00.032 --> 49:06.128
I hope you will sit down and meditate on what I have said.

49:06.329 --> 49:09.674
I do not want to condemn any culture as such.

49:09.875 --> 49:13.160
But I want to protect you from what has happened

49:13.361 --> 49:16.257
to that culture and where it has gone,

49:16.469 --> 49:21.510
to bring you back to your own great culture,

49:21.711 --> 49:24.222
which came to us in thousands of years.

49:24.433 --> 49:27.701
Their culture is very, very, very new,

49:27.902 --> 49:29.848
it’s very new and one day they will also have

49:30.049 --> 49:31.982
the same culture as we have.

49:32.299 --> 49:34.752
But why not we short circuit it

49:35.026 --> 49:38.309
and adjust ourselves to this great culture,

49:38.510 --> 49:46.322
which is so much God oriented, not money oriented,

49:46.487 --> 49:50.357
ego oriented but God oriented?

49:50.558 --> 49:56.834
Let us all attain that state of yogi.

49:57.062 --> 49:59.506
I hope today it will happen to all of you

49:59.694 --> 50:02.423
and that you’ll all get your realization.

50:02.624 --> 50:04.186
May God bless you.
