00:07.822 --> 00:13.032
As Sahaja Yogis you all are very well equipped.

00:13.199 --> 00:19.806
but we all the time forget that we have got our vibrations,

00:20.007 --> 00:24.145
that we have got a new awareness of vibrations.

00:24.378 --> 00:30.303
We have got vibratory awareness and this vibratory awareness

00:30.697 --> 00:40.019
are a kind of a messenger which is absolute,

00:40.251 --> 00:42.975
which communicates and which tells us

00:43.176 --> 00:47.049
what’s wrong with others, what’s wrong with us.

00:47.250 --> 00:59.687
But if you start taking your decision
through your mental, emotional enterprises,

00:59.888 --> 01:10.057
then be sure that you’ll be misguided,
because all these endeavours are one-sided.

01:10.258 --> 01:15.776
Like a mental projection goes like this
in a linear way, falls upon you;

01:15.977 --> 01:24.088
and also an emotional one does the same.
Even the physical is just the same.

01:24.296 --> 01:27.929
But when you start seeing through the vibrations,

01:28.130 --> 01:33.969
what do you do is to ask your Spirit to communicate to you,

01:34.170 --> 01:38.649
and the Spirit is the absolute knowledge.

01:38.850 --> 01:44.182
So you do not succumb to your conditioning or to your ego

01:44.383 --> 01:51.030
or to any other training or any other guru but yourself.

01:51.231 --> 01:55.615
So it is very important for all of you

01:56.361 --> 02:01.126
to understand that we are not going to take any decision

02:01.315 --> 02:08.008
on our mental level but on our vibrations.

02:08.714 --> 02:13.385
Many people think that if I say something about someone,

02:13.586 --> 02:18.440
[it] may be because they have reported it to Me.

02:20.988 --> 02:24.796
But supposing if I am the source of all the vibrations,

02:24.997 --> 02:29.316
what is there for Me to get reported?

02:30.559 --> 02:34.074
Why should anybody report to Me?
If they want to report they may,

02:34.155 --> 02:37.991
but I know what exactly is the situation.

02:38.192 --> 02:46.293
Once in Rahuri I was waiting in the Guest House

02:46.494 --> 02:51.686
and about five, six professors came on their bikes.

02:51.887 --> 02:55.218
[They] came and told Me, “Mother, we have come to warn You

02:55.419 --> 03:00.421
about a particular gentleman.”
I said, “Who is this gentleman?”

03:00.622 --> 03:02.605
They gave the name of this gentleman

03:02.806 --> 03:07.022
and said, “You have to be very careful, he is a politician.”

03:07.223 --> 03:11.749
I said, “Alright, that’s all you know about him?”
They said, “Yes.

03:11.950 --> 03:15.802
So you have to be very careful.” I said,
“Now I’ll tell you about him,

03:16.003 --> 03:21.396
that this man has not married his ‘wife’.

03:21.597 --> 03:26.358
She is the wife of somebody else
and he has eloped with this woman.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.474
And the child is his,

03:29.675 --> 03:33.537
but this lady was raped by him,
that’s how he’s got the child.”

03:33.738 --> 03:36.556
When I started telling, you know, they all started

03:36.757 --> 03:40.115
raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes.

03:40.316 --> 03:44.136
They said,: “Mother, how do you know?” I said,
“You go and find out

03:44.344 --> 03:52.930
whatever I am saying, is it true or not.”
They were completely stunned.

03:53.131 --> 03:55.735
They went back and then reported to Me

03:55.936 --> 04:01.039
that, “Mother, it’s surprising,
what You said was the truth.”

04:01.240 --> 04:06.897
So on vibrations you can know everything,

04:07.098 --> 04:12.557
but those who try to decide things without vibrations,

04:12.758 --> 04:16.499
can make mistakes, till you reach a certain stage

04:16.700 --> 04:21.553
where you don’t have to spread your hands to ask,
just you will know.

04:21.872 --> 04:25.266
But to go to that stage you have to, first of all, surrender

04:25.467 --> 04:30.467
your discretion to vibrations.

04:31.150 --> 04:34.672
Now some people don’t have proper vibrations.

04:34.873 --> 04:40.538
Maybe their Vishuddhis are bad.
They should take proper care of their Vishuddhis.

04:40.738 --> 04:44.135
Even then, if they don’t have some physical problem
on the Vishuddhi,

04:44.336 --> 04:48.584
they can feel it within themselves
what chakras are catching,

04:48.791 --> 04:51.664
what is happening to this gentleman.
