00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:13.032
As Sahaja Yogis you all are very well equipped.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:19.806
but we all the time forget that we have got our vibrations,

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:24.145
that we have got a new awareness of vibrations.

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:30.303
We have got vibratory awareness and this vibratory awareness

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:40.019
are a kind of a messenger which is absolute,

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.975
which communicates and which tells us

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:47.049
what’s wrong with others, what’s wrong with us.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:59.687
But if you start taking your decision 
through your mental, emotional enterprises,

00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:10.057
then be sure that you’ll be misguided, 
because all these endeavours are one-sided.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:15.776
Like a mental projection goes like this
 in a linear way, falls upon you;

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:24.088
and also an emotional one does the same. 
Even the physical is just the same.

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:27.929
But when you start seeing through the vibrations,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.969
what do you do is to ask your Spirit to communicate to you,

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.649
and the Spirit is the absolute knowledge.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.182
So you do not succumb to your conditioning or to your ego

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:51.030
or to any other training or any other guru but yourself.

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:55.615
So it is very important for all of you

00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:01.126
to understand that we are not going to take any decision

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:08.008
on our mental level but on our vibrations.

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:13.385
Many people think that if I say something about someone,

00:02:13.586 --> 00:02:18.440
[it] may be because they have reported it to Me.

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:24.796
But supposing if I am the source of all the vibrations,

00:02:24.997 --> 00:02:29.316
what is there for Me to get reported?

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.074
Why should anybody report to Me? 
If they want to report they may,

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.991
but I know what exactly is the situation.

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:46.293
Once in Rahuri I was waiting in the Guest House

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:51.686
and about five, six professors came on their bikes.

00:02:51.887 --> 00:02:55.218
[They] came and told Me, “Mother, we have come to warn You

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.421
about a particular gentleman.” 
I said, “Who is this gentleman?”

00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:02.605
They gave the name of this gentleman

00:03:02.806 --> 00:03:07.022
and said, “You have to be very careful, he is a politician.”

00:03:07.223 --> 00:03:11.749
I said, “Alright, that’s all you know about him?” 
They said, “Yes.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.802
So you have to be very careful.” I said, 
“Now I’ll tell you about him,

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:21.396
that this man has not married his ‘wife’.

00:03:21.597 --> 00:03:26.358
She is the wife of somebody else 
and he has eloped with this woman.

00:03:26.582 --> 00:03:29.474
And the child is his,

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:33.537
but this lady was raped by him, 
that’s how he’s got the child.”

00:03:33.738 --> 00:03:36.556
When I started telling, you know, they all started

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:40.115
raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes.

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:44.136
They said,: “Mother, how do you know?” I said,
“You go and find out

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:52.930
whatever I am saying, is it true or not.” 
They were completely stunned.

00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.735
They went back and then reported to Me

00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:01.039
that, “Mother, it’s surprising, 
what You said was the truth.”

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.897
So on vibrations you can know everything,

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:12.557
but those who try to decide things without vibrations,

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:16.499
can make mistakes, till you reach a certain stage

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.553
where you don’t have to spread your hands to ask, 
just you will know.

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:25.266
But to go to that stage you have to, first of all, surrender

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:30.467
your discretion to vibrations.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.672
Now some people don’t have proper vibrations.

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:40.538
Maybe their Vishuddhis are bad. 
They should take proper care of their Vishuddhis.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:44.135
Even then, if they don’t have some physical problem 
on the Vishuddhi,

00:04:44.336 --> 00:04:48.584
they can feel it within themselves 
what chakras are catching,

00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.664
what is happening to this gentleman.
