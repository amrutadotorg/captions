00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:08.375
Because of distances and

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.333
also that we have no ashram in Melbourne

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.542
all these days;

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:15.625
I've found that the collectivity is not yet

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.375
properly woven here.

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:22.291
So I think that the best thing is today

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.625
you must worship the Virata.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.291
Virata is the primordial Father, you can say,

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:36.583
or the One who is in our brain, acts

00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:39.417
for our collectivity.

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:55.458
As the Kundalini rises, ultimately She ends up

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:59.583
by piercing through the fontanel bone area.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:03.500
Before entering into that

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.542
She enters into the Sahasrara.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.458
Sahasrara is the area

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.458
which is surrounded by

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:17.375
one thousand nerves

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:19.500
and in the medical terms

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.583
it is called as limbic area.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:28.333
Now one thousand nerves

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.375
are all connected

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.583
to the sixteen important nerves of the Vishuddhi.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:41.375
That's why they say that Shri Krishna had

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:43.625
sixteen thousand wives, that is,

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.458
He had all His powers as His wives

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:51.500
and I have all My powers as My children.

00:05:57.625 --> 00:06:01.583
So when we are growing in our ascent,

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.375
in our dhyana,

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:09.333
we have to go to our Sahasrara.

00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:17.291
If the Sahasrara was not opened out,

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:22.625
we could not have done this en masse realization.

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:25.458
How it is connected,

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.333
the collectivity is so connected

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:31.583
with the present-day Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:36.583
Before that

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.542
it was just

00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:43.625
up to the Agnya chakra

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:49.375
but when It reaches the Sahasrara

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:52.500
It enlightens all the nerves,

00:06:53.458 --> 00:06:55.500
and all the nerves look like

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:59.458
flames which are very silent,

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:03.500
beautifully colored in all vigor colors.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:05.291
And the

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:10.542
appearance of these is so soothing and so beautiful

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.458
that there's no better

00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:15.500
view in the whole world, I think,

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.291
that human beings can see.

00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:23.333
So when this Sahasrara was opened out,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.542
which we are having now a puja as you know,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.458
in Rome

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.417
before that it had to go to the collective,

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:37.542
that is, I had to pay My attention to the collective.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.375
I had to see the people,

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.458
their different problems,

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.583
the permutations and combinations

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:50.583
by which they are all suffering.

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:53.625
They can all be brought

00:07:54.417 --> 00:07:56.542
to the seven major

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:01.417
notes, we can say,

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:06.500
but they are also divided into twenty-one -

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.458
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center.

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:12.625
So we have also gather twenty-one

00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:16.291
really basic problems,

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:18.333
fundamental problems within us

00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:20.375
which we have to solve.

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.625
We have, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:26.458
I tried only to cure people of their physical problems,

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:27.542
mental problems,

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:30.458
their family problems, financial problems,

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:33.458
all kinds of problems have been solved

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:36.291
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:40.375
and we have had some very great mishaps in between.

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.417
As you know that when they came up to the Agnya

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:46.500
they started taking over

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.458
the whole atmosphere

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:52.417
by some sort of a authority

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:55.333
which was not God's authority.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.417
As a result, many people went out at the Agnya

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:05.542
but those who have come to Sahasrara have to understand

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:10.542
that collectivity is the basic of your ascent.

00:09:11.542 --> 00:09:13.375
If you are not collective,

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:17.417
if you do not come to the center,

00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:20.291
if you do not meet each other,

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:23.500
then you are like a nail which is cut out of the finger

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:25.333
and

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:28.417
the Divine has nothing to do with you -

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.291
you are out of the tree,

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:35.375
like the flowers which have come out of the tree

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:38.625
can exist for a while, no doubt,

00:09:39.417 --> 00:09:42.458
but after some time they are dead and finished.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.417
So it is important for all of you to understand

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.375
that collectivity,

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:51.333
if it is not established in Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:53.500
Sahaja Yoga will die out.

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:58.291
I am now going to America where collectivity

00:09:58.583 --> 00:10:00.333
has to be really of the maximum nature,

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.375
has to be really of the maximum nature,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.542
but it is not so.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:08.458
There are so many problems on collectivity in America,

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:12.583
but still I would say that they realize one thing,

00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:14.625
that they have to be very collective.

00:10:15.417 --> 00:10:18.458
The problems are like there are very few people

00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:20.375
who are Sahaja Yogis there,

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:22.375
but among themselves

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.542
they understand responsibility.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:26.458
They are all working very hard.

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:27.625
They are spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:30.417
Now you see they have

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.625
this "Cool Breeze" started from there,

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:34.542
there are so many activities

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:36.542
they are doing in America

00:10:36.667 --> 00:10:39.583
with such a small number that it is amazing

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:42.291
how they are managing these things,

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:43.625
and they do it very beautifully

00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:46.542
because they feel joined together;

00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.333
they are so far away,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.333
from Honolulu to New York is such a long distance.

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:54.417
But there's such a lot of understanding,

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:57.375
such a lot of love

00:10:57.583 --> 00:10:59.542
and sense of responsibility.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:01.625
Because they are a small number they feel

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.583
extremely responsible

00:11:04.333 --> 00:11:06.458
that we have to be absolutely collective

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.625
- no question of having groups.

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:12.417
Even if somebody makes mistakes or something,

00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:15.583
they never talk about it to anybody else but to Me.

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:20.291
They never discuss about each other,

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:22.500
they never talk ill about each other,

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:24.625
they never form any groups.

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.291
The children are outside. Who are?

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:29.458
Just they can came here, there is space.

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:32.458
Can you move a little bit up way in there?

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.583
Just make them space in between.

00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:41.000
Come along.

00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:57.583
Children can sit in the front

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:01.583
they don't occupate much space.

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:05.458
Children can even sit on your laps.

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:11.375
Can you move?

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.625
You can make a gap in between.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.458
Now, this is question of collectivity.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.583
Bring the children up here.

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:27.333
All the children can come along,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.542
they can help Me in puja,

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:32.458
they are very good at helping.

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:33.542
Yes.

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:47.458
Yes, yes, come along.

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:52.333
Poor children were kept out,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.542
can you imagine?

00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.375
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.417
Sit down, sit down, here, sit down. Now.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:14.625
Come along, come along,

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:16.542
come here, come here.

00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:28.542
Now, who are outside now?

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:38.458
See if small children are there.

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:45.500
Come along, come along.

00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:55.333
I think if you could sit little, not with such a big

00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:58.417
assan, little smaller assan,

00:13:58.417 --> 00:13:59.458
people can come.

00:14:02.583 --> 00:14:05.291
And I think open one window also is important.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:13.375
Yes there is some space

00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:15.542
if there are tree cameras,

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:18.333
then how can't there be space?

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:22.625
I think you can have one camera in there

00:14:23.375 --> 00:14:25.333
and they can sit inside.

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:27.667
All right.

00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:35.291
All right.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.542
You all should sit with one

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.542
one knee up like that so there is more space

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:03.583
just like Babamama is sitting.

00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:23.333
Give it to in Chaaya's lap.

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:37.375
Don't spread out your self, little bit

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.625
pull your one leg like that on top.

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:43.417
Yes, one straight one like this

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:45.542
even easier to sit that way.

00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:52.542
Easier to sit.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.542
Now this is the sense of collectivity,

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.291
that it's in a small hall - doesn't matter -

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:06.625
we are all together,

00:17:07.667 --> 00:17:11.291
and how are we going to get all of them inside,

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.625
because you can't enjoy it

00:17:14.458 --> 00:17:16.500
unless and until all of you are together.

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.458
Now, everybody has to keep quiet, all right children

00:17:24.625 --> 00:17:28.208
all of you, otherwise they will ask you again to go out.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:31.625
So now,

00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:34.458
let us see how do we

00:17:36.625 --> 00:17:39.583
miss out on collectivity.

00:17:43.417 --> 00:17:45.583
There's a very practical down-to-earth

00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:48.333
understanding.

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:53.458
First we must know without collectivity we cannot exist.

00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:59.625
As the body has to be in connection with the brain,

00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:04.417
in the same way without collectivity

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.542
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.583
Once you understand that,

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:15.500
then you have to work it out that collectivity

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:19.500
is absolutely established within and without.

00:18:21.375 --> 00:18:23.583
It is more within that you have to establish,

00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:25.500
than without.

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:31.375
Whatever you have within is manifested outside.

00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:37.458
Now how do we establish it within ourselves?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.333
First of all,

00:18:45.458 --> 00:18:49.333
we have to understand

00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:53.542
that now we are the relations of each other.

00:18:55.458 --> 00:18:58.500
Gyaneshwari said, "TechiSoyarikhoti."

00:19:22.375 --> 00:19:28.291
So the first thing is that within ourselves

00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:33.417
we have to see introspection, with introspection,

00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:38.417
what are we doing against collectivity in our mind,

00:19:40.417 --> 00:19:42.417
how our mind is working.

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:47.375
I do not know

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:50.583
what thing comes first in the human mind

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:53.458
about another person,

00:19:54.458 --> 00:19:56.417
but the first thing is that

00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:59.333
these are your real relations

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:05.375
and nobody else are your relations.

00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:09.417
These children are your children

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:14.291
and these men are your brothers,

00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:15.583
and these ladies are your sisters,

00:20:16.667 --> 00:20:19.583
and we are one big family together.

00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:25.542
We are part and parcel of one body,

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:31.333
and this hand cannot hit another hand,

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:35.417
thank God it doesn't think, otherwise as human beings

00:20:35.542 --> 00:20:38.417
they might start thinking against another hand,

00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:40.583
but they don't

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:44.500
because they are connected to one brain activity.

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:50.375
So the first thing one has to understand

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:54.625
that do not try to see the defects of another person,

00:20:55.667 --> 00:20:58.625
but goodness of another person.

00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:06.458
That is really going to help you the most.

00:21:06.625 --> 00:21:08.333
Like in India, you see, I don't know,

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.500
here maybe the same: if you, if they know you,

00:21:14.542 --> 00:21:17.583
supposing, immediately they'll find out,

00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:20.500
now what work can we take out of this person.

00:21:21.583 --> 00:21:23.458
If somebody is a minister's brother,

00:21:23.625 --> 00:21:25.542
immediately they'll approach the minister's brother.

00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:27.500
All right, "Will you do this work for me?"

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:30.375
Then somebody says, "l am such-and-such .. ."

00:21:30.542 --> 00:21:32.500
immediately people will think,

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.458
"Oh, so what, what work can we get out of this person?"

00:21:38.333 --> 00:21:40.500
In the same way you can go little further

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:42.583
in the language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:43.333 --> 00:21:45.375
As soon as you come to know about someone,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.375
you should not think what business I can do with him.

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:51.417
I have seen immediately if somebody has money

00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:53.291
people will jump at him, all right,

00:21:53.417 --> 00:21:55.375
let's have the business together,

00:21:55.542 --> 00:21:56.625
even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.542
Or if there is anything like that immediately they

00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:03.458
start employing that person for your purpose.

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:09.375
On the contrary, what you have to do

00:22:10.542 --> 00:22:12.500
as soon as you know about somebody,

00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:17.291
then you have to think what goodness he has got,

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.458
how can I imbibe that goodness within myself?

00:22:22.417 --> 00:22:26.375
Because we are here to enrich ourselves spiritually.

00:22:30.417 --> 00:22:33.375
So you must think as first and foremost thing,

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.291
"What can I do to get

00:22:37.417 --> 00:22:39.583
the goodness of that person within myself?"

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.333
So you'll be looking out

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.542
for the goodness of that person

00:22:45.625 --> 00:22:49.542
than instead of looking out for bad qualities,

00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:52.625
because bad qualities are not going to nourish you at all.

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:56.458
Also if somebody has bad qualities,

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.583
no use thinking about you yourself

00:23:00.333 --> 00:23:01.500
because if you start thinking about it

00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:05.375
they are not going to be improved,

00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:07.375
it is somebody else's problem.

00:23:08.458 --> 00:23:11.375
The best thing is to look at another person

00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:14.625
with adoration and understanding,

00:23:15.417 --> 00:23:19.458
with love that he is one of us and what can I use?

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.458
Now if I have the hand I don't have to think

00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:24.417
because we are programmed that way.

00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:26.291
If I have to hold this,

00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:28.542
automatically I use My hand, not My feet,

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:30.583
I know My hands are holding,

00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:32.375
but when I have to walk,

00:23:32.542 --> 00:23:34.291
I don't walk with My hands

00:23:34.458 --> 00:23:36.583
because I know My feet have to walk.

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:39.291
In the same way, you have to know

00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:41.417
which Sahaja Yogi

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:48.333
is going to help you to nourish yourself.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.417
Immediately your mind will become very clear.

00:23:57.333 --> 00:23:59.333
Like now I saw some boy in

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:03.291
New Zealand

00:24:04.542 --> 00:24:07.291
who was really about to be dead,

00:24:08.583 --> 00:24:10.417
and when he came back I found

00:24:10.583 --> 00:24:13.291
the attitude towards him was not kind,

00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:18.417
as it should have been,

00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:22.500
but this is the best chance when you should see

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:25.375
how you can practice your compassion.

00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:29.583
We talk of compassion, compassion.

00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:33.333
Now let us see how we can practice our compassion

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.458
when this boy is so sick.

00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:38.333
On the contrary, everybody was harsh on him,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.542
they were passing remarks at him,

00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:42.417
doing things like that.

00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:47.375
Because we have to have compassion,

00:24:47.542 --> 00:24:49.542
now Mother has said we have to have compassion,

00:24:49.667 --> 00:24:52.291
well now where do we have our compassion,

00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:53.375
on the walls?

00:24:53.542 --> 00:24:55.333
Where do we use our compassion?

00:24:55.583 --> 00:24:57.458
Where do we use our compassion?

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.542
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced,

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:02.417
doesn't mean that you sit down

00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:05.583
with My photograph all the time, doesn't mean that.

00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:09.291
It means you practice compassion;

00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:12.291
you practice that.

00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:17.375
Then you have to practice love.

00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:19.542
Now how do you practice love with others?

00:25:20.542 --> 00:25:23.458
If you love someone, what do you do?

00:25:23.583 --> 00:25:25.542
You try to please that person.

00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:31.333
Small things can make people very happy.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.417
I know, you all try to please Me very much,

00:25:33.583 --> 00:25:34.542
you give Me presents,

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:36.625
you find out things which are good for Me,

00:25:37.417 --> 00:25:40.291
you go out of the way buy sweet flowers for Me,

00:25:40.417 --> 00:25:42.458
beautiful things you do to please Me.

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:44.417
I am over-pleased, I must tell you,

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:48.583
but I am more pleased, much more pleased

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:52.375
if you understand collectivity

00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:54.500
and try to please each other.

00:25:55.542 --> 00:25:57.500
Such a person pleases Me the most

00:25:57.667 --> 00:26:02.375
that the attention is more on pleasing each other.

00:26:05.333 --> 00:26:07.458
As soon as you decide you have to please others,

00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:10.291
your tongue will become different.

00:26:10.458 --> 00:26:11.625
It will become much sweeter.

00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:15.500
The tongue which was like a pair of scissors

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.542
becomes such a beautiful thing of honey.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.417
Then you talk little but

00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:24.417
you really pour honey on another person,

00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:27.583
so to the another person really enjoys it.

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:30.625
So now the practice love where do you practice?

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:35.458
Ask you a question: where do I practice love?

00:26:37.417 --> 00:26:38.583
What do I love?

00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:42.291
We live, love our house,

00:26:42.458 --> 00:26:43.500
we love our photographs,

00:26:43.667 --> 00:26:46.291
our decorations, everything,

00:26:46.458 --> 00:26:49.583
but do I practice this love on my wife,

00:26:50.333 --> 00:26:52.500
or on my husband,

00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:56.375
or on other Sahaja Yogis?

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:02.333
In our Sahaj culture

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.375
we have to practice compassion and love,

00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:12.625
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.583
I know some children are maybe

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:20.458
little more mischievous ... and others less mischievous,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.291
maybe some people are very talkative,

00:27:24.458 --> 00:27:26.375
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:30.458
they go on talking, talking, talking, talking, so much!

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.333
Sometimes I think it's good

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.458
because it's a rest for My mouth:

00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:39.542
one way of looking at it.

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:42.458
Another way of looking at it is just switch off your mind,

00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:44.625
let him talk, take it out whatever it was.

00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:49.291
Once he is finished with it and fagged out

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:52.583
then he won't bother you much

00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:55.458
and also he'll feel satisfied

00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:58.333
that somebody has listened to his prattles.

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:00.625
So patience is needed

00:28:01.417 --> 00:28:02.542
and patience is needed

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.458
in such a way

00:28:05.625 --> 00:28:08.375
that others should see your patience.

00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:11.375
Yesterday for example, I was sitting for about I think

00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:14.542
three hours shaking hands with all sorts of people

00:28:16.417 --> 00:28:18.417
and all types of problems,

00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.583
and the person who came last, he said,

00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:23.625
"Looking at Your patience,

00:28:24.417 --> 00:28:25.625
I develop my own patience."

00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:32.291
And love gives you patience.

00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:36.583
This love nourishes you.

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:42.458
I'm telling you, it's absolutely down-to-earth method:

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:45.375
here I've not mentioned that you trust God,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.458
I am just saying trust yourself.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.333
Absolutely down-to-earth

00:28:50.458 --> 00:28:52.500
because we are talking about your brain.

00:28:54.542 --> 00:28:56.542
Now we have been saying

00:28:56.667 --> 00:28:58.583
that we have to forgive everyone,

00:28:59.583 --> 00:29:01.458
but we don't practice that.

00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:06.375
Small, small things like mad people we remember,

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:10.375
that only I have heard that snake has this capacity

00:29:10.542 --> 00:29:12.583
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:16.458
but here I find human beings have no less capacity.

00:29:17.417 --> 00:29:19.375
Whatever has happened 1 3 years back,

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.291
1 5 years back, they all remember

00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:23.458
- each and every thing: whatever has hurt them,

00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:27.291
but how they have hurt others they don't remember,

00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:29.500
how they have been nasty to others

00:29:29.625 --> 00:29:31.458
they don't remember,

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:33.417
because this is a human

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.542
mind which has got the ego

00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.625
it can go on hurting others, it doesn't feel anything,

00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:44.542
and the superego which goes on receiving all the hurts

00:29:44.667 --> 00:29:47.417
and always complaining about it.

00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:53.583
So it is for you to realize

00:29:55.625 --> 00:29:58.583
that you are the one who is breaking

00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.333
the collectivity.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:01.625
the collectivity.

00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:06.458
First of all, we had horrible leaders here,

00:30:06.625 --> 00:30:08.583
that's how our collectivity was very poor

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:11.542
but now we are getting soberer people,

00:30:12.333 --> 00:30:13.375
better people.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.291
Also for Melbourne I am thinking of getting

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:22.291
somebody elderly for you to be the leader

00:30:22.417 --> 00:30:26.625
because I think Greg is full with responsibility.

00:30:27.417 --> 00:30:29.625
So, I thought of Henshaw

00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:31.625
and I asked him and he has agreed.

00:30:32.417 --> 00:30:34.542
So now in Melbourne we'll have somebody

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.333
staying in the ashram, who is a retired man,

00:30:37.458 --> 00:30:38.500
who'll look after you,

00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:41.333
will do everything that is possible

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.583
to look after the collectivity of Melbourne.

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:50.417
But you have to know that

00:30:50.542 --> 00:30:52.625
I have one connection with you

00:30:54.417 --> 00:30:57.458
through your leader.

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:01.375
That doesn't mean you cannot connect.

00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:05.333
Like supposing there's a pin

00:31:05.542 --> 00:31:06.542
and you put the pin to Me,

00:31:07.333 --> 00:31:08.458
immediately My hand will go off

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:10.417
- means there's a reflex action also,

00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:13.333
but mostly everything is reported to the brain.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.458
In the same way,

00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:17.333
everything should be reported to the brain

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:19.417
but from the very beginning if you develop

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:23.625
a kind of a criticizing attitude towards your leader,

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.333
then it becomes very difficult

00:31:28.375 --> 00:31:30.625
- for the leader as well as for you.

00:31:31.417 --> 00:31:33.333
First you should not criticize.

00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:36.375
Don't use your brain for criticism,

00:31:36.542 --> 00:31:39.583
already criticism has been too much in the West.

00:31:40.667 --> 00:31:43.583
I mean, now they have got now technique of criticizing.

00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:47.625
All the art is finished because of the critics.

00:31:48.458 --> 00:31:51.375
The artists are afraid to show their paintings,

00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:53.542
artists are afraid to show their creations

00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:55.583
because they will be criticized.

00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:59.583
Now the only thing that is left are critics, critics, critics,

00:32:00.375 --> 00:32:02.625
and the critics are criticizing critics, that's all.

00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:06.625
There is no creativity, nothing.

00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:10.458
So try to appreciate everything.

00:32:10.625 --> 00:32:13.583
Children are producing pictures, paintings anyway.

00:32:15.583 --> 00:32:19.333
They make sometimes My faces very funny

00:32:19.583 --> 00:32:22.291
when they draw - not the children, even grownups.

00:32:22.458 --> 00:32:24.500
Doesn't matter, I appreciate it,

00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:27.333
it's very good, wonderful, very nice,

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.291
to encourage that person.

00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:32.542
So criticism should go out of our mind,

00:32:32.667 --> 00:32:35.417
but appreciation should be practiced:

00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:39.542
appreciation of others' children,

00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:44.583
appreciation of other people is very important

00:32:45.375 --> 00:32:48.417
but that doesn't mean that you appreciate all others

00:32:48.583 --> 00:32:52.333
and torture your wife or torture your husband

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.458
- that also is an imbalance.

00:32:55.417 --> 00:32:58.375
First responsibility is your family

00:32:58.542 --> 00:33:00.625
but you should appreciate others,

00:33:01.458 --> 00:33:04.333
and this comes when you have no jealousies

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.583
about anyone.

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.542
This jealousy I don't know from where it comes,

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:11.375
I don't know this quality of jealousy,

00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:13.291
why there is jealousy.

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:17.458
So, also if you have jealousy you have to use it

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.375
for the right purpose,

00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:21.542
and what is the right purpose

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.583
is that you should be jealous of a person

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:26.291
who is spiritually higher than you,

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.417
and you practice it that you become better.

00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:31.583
If jealousy is for competition,

00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:34.333
then you compete with the person

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.625
who is more compassionate, more loving,

00:33:39.375 --> 00:33:41.500
more sacrificing, more patient.

00:33:45.542 --> 00:33:48.625
So this competition becomes a very healthy competition

00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:52.458
and the collectivity becomes very nourished.

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:55.625
Now try to feel that you are all

00:33:56.375 --> 00:33:58.500
part and parcel of one personality.

00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:03.375
Try to understand this and practice this.

00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:06.417
This will help you a lot.

00:34:08.542 --> 00:34:12.375
Little things like buying a little present for someone.

00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:15.291
You see something, "Oh,

00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:18.417
this will be very nice for this person."

00:34:18.625 --> 00:34:21.500
We have officially decided

00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:23.500
that the men should not give presents to women

00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:26.291
and women should not give presents to men,

00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:29.333
but if she is your sister, rakhi sister you can give

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.458
and the rakhi sister can give to the brother,

00:34:32.667 --> 00:34:34.583
but otherwise one should not do that.

00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:36.458
We have done it because I have seen

00:34:36.625 --> 00:34:38.458
it creates problems,

00:34:38.625 --> 00:34:41.458
but that doesn't mean you hate women or hate men.

00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:45.417
But a distance has to be maintained of purity

00:34:47.333 --> 00:34:49.333
till you become completely innocent

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.625
is better is to keep that distance.

00:34:57.667 --> 00:35:00.583
This purity is to be practiced

00:35:03.417 --> 00:35:05.375
and this practice of purity is

00:35:05.542 --> 00:35:09.500
that you try to develop your innocent

00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:12.375
feelings towards others.

00:35:13.417 --> 00:35:15.458
In innocence everything comes,

00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:18.583
everything comes in innocence.

00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:21.375
If you are innocent

00:35:22.417 --> 00:35:25.542
you will immediately become

00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.375
a very good Sahaja Yogi

00:35:29.375 --> 00:35:31.291
but it has so many facets.

00:35:31.625 --> 00:35:33.458
Like the other day there was one girl

00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:37.542
she was fighting for getting some sort of a sweet,

00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:43.417
and they were distributing the prasads.

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:45.542
So I gave her one of the small plates,

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:47.333
I said, "You distribute."

00:35:47.458 --> 00:35:49.417
Immediately she forgot what she wanted,

00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:52.291
she started distributing very sweetly with little,

00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:55.333
little hands the prasad to everyone, very sweet.

00:35:57.417 --> 00:36:01.333
So this has to be practiced from childhood,

00:36:01.458 --> 00:36:03.291
with your children you have to tell them,

00:36:03.417 --> 00:36:04.542
"Alright, let's do these things,

00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:06.458
distribute this to people,

00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:09.458
go and put kumkum on their heads"

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:11.500
- they may not do it well, but doesn't matter.

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:13.583
They will learn how to meet others,

00:36:14.375 --> 00:36:16.417
how to talk to them, how to be with others.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.458
Now the worst enemy of

00:36:20.417 --> 00:36:22.375
collectivity is aggressiveness.

00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:25.375
Some people are basically aggressive;

00:36:25.542 --> 00:36:28.375
their style of talking is extremely aggressive.

00:36:29.458 --> 00:36:31.625
The way they say things is aggressive,

00:36:32.417 --> 00:36:33.458
maybe because anything,

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:35.625
maybe they are better educated,

00:36:36.667 --> 00:36:39.375
maybe they come from a very aggressive family,

00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:43.375
maybe they are having a kind of a

00:36:44.333 --> 00:36:46.291
superiority complex

00:36:46.417 --> 00:36:49.458
or an inferiority complex or a sense of insecurity,

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.333
or maybe they are possessed.

00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:56.583
They try to dominate and show their very strong

00:36:57.625 --> 00:37:04.458
feelings towards people of superiority.

00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:07.583
They may be inferior, it's not necessary,

00:37:08.375 --> 00:37:09.417
but they do

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:12.583
and this is something is to be curbed.

00:37:13.625 --> 00:37:18.458
So what you have to practice here is humility:

00:37:18.583 --> 00:37:20.291
try to be humble.

00:37:21.583 --> 00:37:24.291
There was a joke like this,

00:37:24.458 --> 00:37:27.375
that one gentleman was going on the staircase

00:37:28.417 --> 00:37:29.625
and another was coming from the top.

00:37:34.417 --> 00:37:36.625
So this gentleman who was going up there

00:37:39.583 --> 00:37:41.583
said to the other that, "Please move."

00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:45.291
So he said, "l don't move for fools."

00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:48.542
The person who was climbing up, he said,

00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:51.458
"But I do" and he moved out.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.417
That's how the humility works.

00:37:56.542 --> 00:38:01.583
You have to be humble in your approach to others.

00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:05.542
I mean, English language is outwardly very humble,

00:38:06.583 --> 00:38:08.291
like you must say "please"

00:38:08.458 --> 00:38:09.500
you must say "thank you" ten times,

00:38:09.625 --> 00:38:12.375
please, please, please, thank you, thank you, thank you,

00:38:13.417 --> 00:38:15.291
but not in the heart.

00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:17.375
Like supposing somebody doesn't say thank you,

00:38:17.542 --> 00:38:19.417
the other person may even beat you.

00:38:19.625 --> 00:38:21.375
"Why didn't you say 'thank you' to me?"

00:38:23.542 --> 00:38:25.375
This is not humility.

00:38:25.583 --> 00:38:32.291
Humility is that in no way you try to aggress others,

00:38:32.458 --> 00:38:34.291
and if others are aggressive

00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:37.333
you accept it as a childish thing,

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.542
as a stupid thing,

00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:40.458
as a foolish thing,

00:38:40.625 --> 00:38:42.375
it has no meaning:

00:38:42.542 --> 00:38:45.458
because you are so powerful, you can bear it.

00:38:46.667 --> 00:38:49.625
That is humility which you have to practice

00:38:50.417 --> 00:38:52.542
and all these qualities if you have,

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.375
you will really be surprised

00:38:58.583 --> 00:39:01.417
that you will lose your selfishness.

00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:03.625
Your selfishness will start dropping out

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.417
because selfishness how

00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:09.542
ugly it is

00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:12.291
you start realizing very soon

00:39:12.458 --> 00:39:14.625
when you become generous.

00:39:15.417 --> 00:39:17.542
So you practice your generosity.

00:39:19.375 --> 00:39:20.417
You are all willing to spend

00:39:20.583 --> 00:39:21.583
lot of money on Me, I know.

00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:23.583
You want to give Me presents - I've stopped it now -

00:39:24.375 --> 00:39:25.417
that individually

00:39:25.583 --> 00:39:27.458
you cannot give Me any presents or anything,

00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:30.417
but generosity is a general term:

00:39:30.625 --> 00:39:33.417
generosity of kindness,

00:39:33.583 --> 00:39:36.333
generosity of compassion,

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:38.542
generosity of patience,

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.417
and generosity of material things.

00:39:44.542 --> 00:39:47.291
If I see something, immediately I think,

00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:50.291
"Oh, I should take this because I know l can give it

00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:52.500
to this lady or to this gentleman this thing,

00:39:52.625 --> 00:39:54.583
or I could give it to this purpose

00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:56.500
or for this organization

00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:59.458
or for this kind of a work we are doing."

00:39:59.583 --> 00:40:00.333
Immediately it comes to Me.

00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:01.333
Immediately it comes to Me.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.625
You'd be surprised that if I'm in the market

00:40:05.375 --> 00:40:07.625
and if I'm thirsty, I don't even think

00:40:08.417 --> 00:40:10.375
that I should go and buy

00:40:11.417 --> 00:40:12.583
some soft drink for Myself

00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:14.417
- doesn't come into mind.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.542
Even I have never opened My 'fridge in My lifetime,

00:40:19.333 --> 00:40:22.291
but for others I'll run about,

00:40:22.458 --> 00:40:23.417
I'll cook for them,

00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:25.375
but supposing

00:40:25.542 --> 00:40:27.333
I'm in the house and there's no cook,

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.625
I'll not cook for Myself - it's all right.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.542
If there's nobody in the house,

00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:32.583
if My husband is not there,

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:34.417
I will not eat for two/three days

00:40:34.625 --> 00:40:37.291
and then servants, servant will complain to My husband

00:40:37.458 --> 00:40:39.417
then I remember, really, I didn't eat any food?

00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:40.500
I didn't know.

00:40:41.333 --> 00:40:43.291
If I am eating I am just eating because he is there,

00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:44.500
so I have to eat with him.

00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:47.333
I never used to take tea

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.458
but because he is so much fond of tea,

00:40:50.583 --> 00:40:52.458
I started, so I keep the practice

00:40:52.625 --> 00:40:55.458
so that I should not give it the practice up.

00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:57.542
Later on it will be difficult

00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:01.333
it just adjusting yourself to others,

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:02.500
it's not difficult.

00:41:02.667 --> 00:41:07.375
Few things here and there that pleases, you should.

00:41:07.625 --> 00:41:10.291
There's no harm in trying to please.

00:41:10.458 --> 00:41:11.583
It's not only for the wife to do it,

00:41:12.375 --> 00:41:13.583
even the husband has to do something

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:15.417
to please the wife

00:41:15.583 --> 00:41:17.417
- it's not only between husband and wife,

00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:18.625
it will be between children and you,

00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:21.417
between the whole family of Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:24.542
it should be such that we should adjust.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.458
So practice your adjustments

00:41:27.625 --> 00:41:29.542
as you have to adjust your cameras.

00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:31.583
If you don't adjust the camera,

00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:34.375
you do not get the right picture. In the same way,

00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:36.625
unless and until you adjust yourself

00:41:37.458 --> 00:41:40.417
to the whole atmosphere, to a person,

00:41:40.542 --> 00:41:42.417
you cannot get the real picture,

00:41:42.625 --> 00:41:46.375
and then you start fighting with that.

00:41:46.625 --> 00:41:50.542
It is actually the fight has to be within yourself.

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.333
It's quite a long, long story, I mean,

00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:55.291
as far as I know human beings

00:41:55.458 --> 00:41:58.583
and the problems of collectivity,

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:03.583
and certain problems are being solved now,

00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:05.375
I am happy about it,

00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:07.500
that people are not falling in love,

00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:09.333
I mean they are not falling

00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:11.417
and having a bump on their heads.

00:42:11.542 --> 00:42:14.625
But it's better now, they are taking it easy,

00:42:15.417 --> 00:42:18.542
thinking it over and are marrying a person

00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:22.500
for marriage sake and not for falling in love.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.417
There is something very great is happening

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:28.458
because that would give you purification of mind

00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:30.583
and a mind which doesn't

00:42:31.375 --> 00:42:33.583
hover over nonsensical things.

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:39.291
So as I said, practice all these things

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:42.625
and your collectivity will be beautiful,

00:42:44.583 --> 00:42:48.542
and the best is to practice your meditation together.

00:42:49.583 --> 00:42:51.542
In Delhi we have started an ashram,

00:42:51.667 --> 00:42:54.500
every morning I find people coming,

00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:56.542
sitting together to meditate,

00:42:57.333 --> 00:42:58.583
it's like a temple, it's like a church.

00:42:59.333 --> 00:43:01.583
They come there and so many of them

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:04.458
are sitting and meditating together.

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.375
Meditating together is the best way

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.542
to feel the collectivity.

00:43:12.417 --> 00:43:14.291
You can meditate at home, of course,

00:43:14.417 --> 00:43:15.625
you also cleanse it for your depth,

00:43:16.375 --> 00:43:17.625
but also you must meditate together

00:43:18.417 --> 00:43:19.500
and when you meditate together

00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:23.417
then the strength that you have

00:43:23.542 --> 00:43:25.375
strengthens others,

00:43:25.542 --> 00:43:28.417
and the strength of the whole collectivity

00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:29.583
improves so much.

00:43:30.375 --> 00:43:32.500
You are meditating together is a very big thing.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.458
Everyone has to understand that whenever you get time

00:43:37.583 --> 00:43:39.542
you find out in the morning times, for example,

00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:42.583
we'll go to the ashram and meditate.

00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:44.375
Say, Sunday morning,

00:43:44.542 --> 00:43:46.417
we'll just go and meditate in the ashram.

00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:48.375
Just for meditation you have to come.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.583
Meditate and go away

00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:52.375
because I reside in this ashram,

00:43:52.583 --> 00:43:55.375
I am here, so leave your homes,

00:43:55.542 --> 00:43:57.375
come here and meditate.

00:43:58.333 --> 00:44:00.291
Meditation will help you a lot.

00:44:00.417 --> 00:44:03.458
Wherever you are together, I am with you

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:06.333
but when you are away from each other,

00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:07.500
I am not with you.

00:44:08.542 --> 00:44:10.500
Only in difficulties,

00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:12.583
when you are pushed into some places

00:44:13.333 --> 00:44:14.333
where I am not there,

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.375
where you think I am not there, I am there.

00:44:18.417 --> 00:44:19.375
But

00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:23.291
if you deliberately are keeping out of collectivity,

00:44:23.458 --> 00:44:24.417
I am not with you,

00:44:24.542 --> 00:44:26.417
so try to grow your collectivity

00:44:26.625 --> 00:44:28.375
otherwise you cannot go deep

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.542
into your own depths,

00:44:31.667 --> 00:44:33.583
you cannot become a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:37.458
you cannot really be called a Sahaja Yogi.

00:44:38.458 --> 00:44:40.417
Those who have a sense of collectivity

00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:42.417
can only become that.

00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:45.375
So we have

00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:47.625
before us in Melbourne so many people

00:44:48.417 --> 00:44:50.333
and when the quantity increases,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.291
the quality should not fall down

00:44:52.458 --> 00:44:53.583
and the quality of

00:44:56.375 --> 00:45:01.291
collectivity has to be very strong

00:45:01.458 --> 00:45:03.417
by having very strong bonds.

00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:05.542
I like when you praise someone.

00:45:05.667 --> 00:45:08.458
Normally I have seen whenever I am anywhere,

00:45:08.625 --> 00:45:11.291
people only talk about people who are negative,

00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:12.583
nobody talks about positive people,

00:45:13.417 --> 00:45:14.458
so I don't know about them,

00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:16.417
mostly I know who are negative.

00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:17.583
So I would love to know

00:45:18.375 --> 00:45:19.583
about people who are very positive,

00:45:20.375 --> 00:45:22.417
who are great, who are doing good things

00:45:22.583 --> 00:45:24.583
and forget about the negative

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:26.500
- they'll drop out anyway.

00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:31.333
So best thing is to tell about the people who are positive,

00:45:31.458 --> 00:45:34.333
who are doing good work,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.542
who are real Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:41.500
I bless you all in Melbourne

00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:44.291
that you have a beautiful collectivity

00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:47.583
and enjoy yourself and every, every meeting

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:50.542
should be a festival for you and an enjoyment.

00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:52.458
May God bless you!

00:45:58.667 --> 00:46:02.458
So thus today we have to worship Virata.

00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:04.458
He is nothing but Akbar

00:46:04.625 --> 00:46:07.542
who is Shri Krishna Himself becoming Virata.
