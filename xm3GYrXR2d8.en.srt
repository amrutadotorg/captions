1
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:36,858
I'm sure Phil must have

2
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:38,432
explained to you

3
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:41,349
the mechanism

4
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:43,849
of our evolution

5
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,464
as you see before yourself

6
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:53,823
that there are different centers

7
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:56,323
at the different level of the body

8
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:00,255
and all these centers denote

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,596
our different stages of our evolution

10
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,822
these centers cannot be seen

11
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:11,452
there are subtle centers

12
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:14,660
placed in the medulla oblongata

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
means in the spinal cord

14
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:19,503
and also in the brain

15
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:25,778
as I told you yesterday that

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,460
God has created us

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
for the purpose

18
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,475
and the whole thing has been done

19
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:38,402
very beautifully, with great compassion, care.

20
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,236
is one very delicately

21
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:46,045
and all these centers denote within us

22
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:48,441
the kind of the growth

23
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,331
that has been manifesting

24
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,806
one after another.

25
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:55,306
But at the human stage

26
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:56,720
we are still

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,758
in transition stage

28
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,466
because we do not know the meaning of our life.

29
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:05,305
The meaning of our life

30
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:07,115
will only be known

31
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,615
when we become connected

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,118
with that power which has

33
00:02:12,618 --> 00:02:13,644
created us,

34
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,378
the power that has evolved us,

35
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,571
the power that desired

36
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,153
for our creation

37
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:24,653
that activated

38
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:28,127
for our creation and the one that evolved us.

39
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:32,548
These three powers are indicated in those three lines.

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,051
The left side is the power of desire,

41
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,610
which looks after the past, the sub-conscious 

42
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,183
and the collective sub-conscious, 

43
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,865
and the another one which activates is on the right hand side 

44
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,498
which looks after the action, 

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,165
the activation, the creation 

46
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:54,928
up to a stage when life started taking its form.

47
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,445
Then comes in the carbon atom.

48
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:05,606
Carbon atom is a very important pivotal element that was created

49
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:10,544
at a point where it had four valences which it couldn't

50
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,019
depart or put received.

51
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:20,434
This came as a special catalyst, we can say,

52
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:26,988
which started creating life. Now, the life was created, 

53
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:32,766
but, after creating that life as a unicellular animal,

54
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:35,213
we had to become human beings.

55
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:42,967
The chairs do not grow, this hall will not grow,

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,839
nothing is going to grow which is dead.

57
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:50,885
But, whatever is living grows and evolves.

58
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:55,324
We have become human beings at a stage

59
00:03:55,824 --> 00:03:58,923
where that center is near the neck.

60
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Where we have raised our neck up,

61
00:04:03,156 --> 00:04:08,409
where the animals put their head up.

62
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:12,473
A new system started building up within themselves,

63
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:15,138
by which a crossing took place

64
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:20,327
and this crossing of the energies created these two pouches

65
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,666
called ego and superego.

66
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,561
Because there was no outlet.

67
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:30,944
The animals have both the feet and both the hands 

68
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:37,231
on the ground which comes from the hind legs and goes

69
00:04:37,332 --> 00:04:39,121
through the forelegs. 

70
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,378
But in the human beings, when he raised his head,

71
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:48,328
then a new system developed within him by which he created ego.

72
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:52,090
When he worked, when he took action 

73
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:57,631
action through his mental and his physical capacities,

74
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,608
he developed a system called ego.

75
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:04,622
Actually ego is a complete myth.

76
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:09,447
Because we really do not do anything. As I said, we only do dead work.

77
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,215
We cannot do one living work. 

78
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,681
We cannot do any living work. 

79
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,143
And so the ego that is within us is just a myth that we are doing it.

80
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:31,070
So this myth rises and the superego at the animal stage is pressed back

81
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:35,029
and when both of them combine on top of your head, 

82
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,935
till about the age of twelve years,

83
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,757
the calcification takes place

84
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:45,381
and you become yourself,

85
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:50,768
you become completely independent. The "I"ness develops.

86
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,342
That means you become like an egg.

87
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,906
Now you are a separate entity, a free entity,

88
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:04,266
which can work out the left and the right side,

89
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:09,247
which is like a brake and the accelerator of a car

90
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:15,765
and learn how to use them to develop balance within you

91
00:06:18,143 --> 00:06:19,587
by making mistakes,

92
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:24,161
by experimenting, you develop your wisdom in the center.

93
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:30,750
Sometimes the human beings go to the extremes, as I told you yesterday,

94
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:34,184
how they go on to the right side into the extremes

95
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:37,849
and what diseases they develop and what problems they develop.

96
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:42,396
In the same way, I told you a day earlier

97
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:47,072
that when you go to the left, how you develop your problems

98
00:06:47,196 --> 00:06:48,699
of emotional side and

99
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:52,363
even a disease like cancer comes to you from the left extremes.

100
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,733
Now, in the center is the evolutionary process,

101
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:01,828
is the power of evolution, is the power of your sustenance. 

102
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:06,675
For example, carbon has four valences, that means,

103
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:10,285
the carbon has got the sustenance of four.

104
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:14,673
Human beings have ten sustenances

105
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:19,007
which are expressed in the Bible as the Ten Commandments.

106
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,058
These are for the sustenance of human beings.

107
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:25,923
When Moses was on this earth, that time

108
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:30,630
it was too early to talk of Self-Realization, about Spirit.

109
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:33,503
As the tree was growing, the tree of life,

110
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,410
he talked about the tree of life, tree of fire, 

111
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:42,579
about Kundalini he did talk. But, he more talked about the sustenance,

112
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,295
about the maintenance of the balance, of the being.

113
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:49,386
He was more particular on that point,

114
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:54,496
because that was the time where people had to learn to be in a balance.

115
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,927
He didn't talk of baptism,

116
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,746
for example, Jews don't believe in baptism.

117
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:06,838
But he did say that somebody is going to come,

118
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:12,426
Maseeha, and He is going to give you the Spirit.

119
00:08:12,497 --> 00:08:14,529
He is going to give you the Realization.

120
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,068
But, Jews as you know, denied Christ, they didn't believe in Him

121
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:22,906
and that's how Christ was crucified.

122
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:29,695
Now Christ is a very, very important advent on this earth. 

123
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,435
Apart from other advents, first of all, I'll tell you

124
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,342
about Christ, how important He is 

125
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:41,240
and how He plays a very important role in the human beings.

126
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,053
People just talk of Christ - Christ, Christ.

127
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:48,493
We should go to the church, say Christ, Jesus Christ is the one I see.

128
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:51,308
So many posters saying Jesus Christ is within you,

129
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:55,572
Jesus Christ is coming, Jesus Christ is here, but where?

130
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,712
Where is He? Where does He reside within us? He resides

131
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:05,292
in the center which is the sixth center called as Agnya.

132
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:09,279
This center is placed between the pituitary

133
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:12,283
and pineal body, is a very subtle center

134
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,510
and has got two sub-plexuses.

135
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,221
He incarnates there

136
00:09:19,688 --> 00:09:22,250
as the embodiment of innocence.

137
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:27,079
That's why He is such a powerful deity who incarnates 

138
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,746
and settles down in that area.

139
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:36,016
His coming on this earth was very important because the ego and superego

140
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,492
had crossed each other

141
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,550
and there was no space for the Kundalini to pass through.

142
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:45,037
That is the cross where He was crucified.

143
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,327
And when He came on this earth,

144
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:56,601
four thousand years before that, Shri Krishna described that the power

145
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:03,857
which is divine cannot be destroyed. The Spirit cannot be destroyed,

146
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:08,778
it cannot be burnt, it cannot be blown off.

147
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,412
And that's why Christ had to come on this earth to establish that truth.

148
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:18,505
He was one who was "Aum", the one

149
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:23,270
who was the Primordial sound and that's why He could walk on top

150
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:27,295
of the water. Only the sound can travel on top of the water

151
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:29,220
because it has no gravity to fall down.

152
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:35,806
It was a special creation of Jesus Christ in the heavens, it's described

153
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:41,041
in many books - Indian books, scriptures, He is described as Mahavishnu.

154
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:47,388
Of course, the people who call themselves Christians got their Christianity

155
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:54,192
from various sources and they interpreted it the way they wanted to.

156
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:58,033
For example, St. Paul in the Bible 

157
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,567
is not a realized soul, nor he has got anything to do with Christ.

158
00:11:01,664 --> 00:11:04,990
Nothing. He never met Christ, he had nothing to do,

159
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:09,985
he just came forward, he was killing Christians, he was a half Jew

160
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,643
and a half Greek, and he had bribed people to get a Roman 

161
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:17,753
visa or something like that.

162
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,738
And he was there as a Roman soldier. And he was killing people,

163
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,685
he was killing Christians. And suddenly

164
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:28,197
he says that he saw a light and he, a self-appointed man

165
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,551
and I don't know why he is in the Bible, he should not have been there.

166
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:33,969
He is a very misguiding personality 

167
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:39,831
and that misguidance is today acting against, against Christ.

168
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:41,762
Actually, I have a feeling

169
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:44,991
that always, when such a great man comes in on this earth,

170
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:48,236
and His work starts, some negative forces

171
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:52,020
become very subtle and come forward to help

172
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:55,755
the cause and actually they are against God.

173
00:11:56,824 --> 00:12:00,234
This I will prove it you later on, why I am saying so.

174
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:05,739
But, Jesus Christ Himself, He came on this earth

175
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:12,681
because we had a problem - the problem was of ego.

176
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,944
The problem was, whatever work we did, whatever 

177
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:24,385
bad things we did created an institution of sin,

178
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:32,815
we became sinners that made us a personality which was sinning.

179
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:38,868
And He came on this earth to suck all the sins from us.

180
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:42,878
It is all promised in the ancient scriptures

181
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:48,575
that such and such personality will be coming and when He comes, He

182
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:53,721
is awakened by the Kundalini and if He will be awakened

183
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:58,877
in the Kundalini, then He will suck your sins. So, there will be no Karmas,

184
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:03,615
there will be no sin, not at all. So He came on this earth

185
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:09,450
for sucking our sins, to take our sins, He died for our sins, we all say this.

186
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,191
Then why do you have the idea of sin anymore?

187
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:15,373
Why do you go and confess about your sins?

188
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:18,915
Because if Christ is there and if He is awakened,

189
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,358
He will definitely suck our sins.

190
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:25,752
And the second idea people had that we have to suffer.

191
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,721
This was the idea which came from the Jews,

192
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:31,317
that we have to suffer, we must all suffer.

193
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,106
This must have come from the time when Moses was there.

194
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,945
Now thousand of years have passed that this Moses was there

195
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,056
and that it was promised that somebody is going to come

196
00:13:44,312 --> 00:13:47,975
who will suffer for you, once and for all. And all your sufferings

197
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:52,798
He will take. Such a great personality was that of Christ.

198
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:57,411
He came on this earth, He went through all the sufferings and still

199
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:01,194
even Christians go on saying, we have to suffer. Why?

200
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,284
Has He not suffered sufficiently for you?

201
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:08,615
Are you going to suffer little more than Him? Why have you to suffer?

202
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:13,249
Only thing what has to happen in you is that Christ is to be awakened.

203
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:16,471
If Christ is awakened within you, you will be amazed

204
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:20,478
that all these so-called sufferings disappear just like that.

205
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:25,639
There are no sufferings anymore left. We have seen patients

206
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:28,401
of cancer who are suffering very much,

207
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:33,719
who are told by doctors that you will die within two weeks time. Is a fact.

208
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:40,518
Now, if their Kundalini is awakened, their cancer disappears,

209
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:45,836
all their pain disappears, all their agony disappears and they feel very light

210
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:50,783
and they feel that they have become collectively conscious,

211
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,247
that they are saved. They all know that they are saved.

212
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:58,648
Once it happens, then immediately, the lightness

213
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:03,629
of the whole mind, the lightness of the body, the lightness

214
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:08,770
of your being is felt and you feel so light as if you are floating

215
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:13,313
in the joy of God. And this is what was promised

216
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:14,968
and we should have expected.

217
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:19,133
But what we did was to go back to the same old stuff,

218
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:21,995
which was thousands of years back without understanding

219
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:23,967
that if it was the growth,

220
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:27,762
if it was the living process, the living process always

221
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:31,533
transforms one from another stage to another stage.

222
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,634
Like we can see a seed, seed becomes a root, the root

223
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:39,562
then has the shoots, and the shoot has other parts

224
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:43,600
one by one till it becomes a blossoming flower,

225
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,091
flowering tree and then that tree bears fruits.

226
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,373
And then these fruits also fall off. In the same way,

227
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,441
if life has to grow through evolutionary process,

228
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:59,310
there has to be stages by which we have to move,

229
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:03,107
it is not that every time that somebody comes, he starts a new religion.

230
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:08,010
How can it be? Christ has said, those who are not against Me are with Me.

231
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:12,396
Now, who are those people who are with Him? He said it very clearly.

232
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:16,678
Even Mohammed accepted Christ as a very great soul and

233
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:20,614
He has said that you must wait for the day of resurrection.

234
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:23,003
But who is talking of Day of Resurrection?

235
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,089
Among Muslims, nobody talks of that, they only talk of the day of doom.

236
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:32,956
I don't know why human beings are so anxious to go to that day of doom

237
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:37,106
without going to the resurrection. We are here to be resurrected

238
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:42,203
and redeemed and that is what is Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga

239
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:46,575
not only counsels you, tells you all about it, it gives you

240
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:51,294
redemption and a comfort, a comfort that is,

241
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:57,401
from the sins and from the worries of life. This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

242
00:16:58,344 --> 00:17:00,909
Now there are other deities who are settled down

243
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:05,307
in other centers, about which you can read in the book, it's given very clearly.

244
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:09,781
But people get shocked about it, when I told them that these are deities

245
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:13,503
are placed here, there and there. For example, if I talk to Indians,

246
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,892
they think I am preaching about Christ, I am supporting Christ;

247
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,331
I am making everybody Christians, that's how they started looking at Me.

248
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:23,697
And when I tell you about Shri Krishna, you will say the same to Me,

249
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:27,663
because human beings have a habit to form a club.

250
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,579
Now if you are following Christ,

251
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,357
then you cannot see anything beyond,

252
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,193
you see, you just get closed like that.

253
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:38,162
But you don't see even what has these Christian church done to you.

254
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,556
I was born myself in a Christian Church

255
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,556
and I know they have done nothing whatsoever.

256
00:17:44,056 --> 00:17:48,033
Same about Hindus - what have their temples done for anyone?

257
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:52,351
Go to these Muslims - what have they done for these Muslims? Nothing.

258
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:56,633
Except for building big, big, huge mosques and churches

259
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,163
and temples and half of the England, I am told that the church is owning.

260
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:04,512
How are they going to recognize Christ? When Christ comes in,

261
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:08,464
are you going to recognize Him? How can you? Which is the way?

262
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:12,285
There are many who say, we pray to God, we say God,

263
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:14,040
give us some job now,

264
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,157
we use God for every third person.

265
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:22,849
God is not in your pocket. You have to be connected with God.

266
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:26,716
You have to be one with Him. Otherwise, you will be arrested.

267
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,391
As without connection, you cannot approach anybody in authority,

268
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:34,252
how can you approach the One who is the Authority of all the Authorities,

269
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:37,575
without even having any connection or protocol?

270
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,950
So all these people who are supposed to be in charge of Christ,

271
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:45,178
in charge of Shri Krishna, in charge of Shri Rama,

272
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,802
are all just I must say, are telling lies.

273
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:49,507
Because they are not.

274
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:52,922
They have nothing to do with them.

275
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:57,135
None of them can really deliver the goods.

276
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:59,696
On the contrary, if you go and tell them

277
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,502
that this is the time of judgment,

278
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:04,473
and this is the time where you must accept

279
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,279
that you are to be redeemed,

280
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:09,393
that's the main thing, you are to be redeemed, if you are not redeemed,

281
00:19:09,644 --> 00:19:13,345
then all those things are absolutely useless for human beings.

282
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:16,169
The emancipation of human beings has to be brought in -

283
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,773
if it cannot be done, then give up all these nonsensical ideas and

284
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,418
dogmas and fighting things and come up and see for yourself what is reality.

285
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:28,881
But they'll not do it, because they exist on our ignorance, they exist

286
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:32,818
because we are ignorant about it. The force exists within you,

287
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:37,992
the Spirit exists within you, you don't have to go to these places

288
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,908
where there is no talk of Spirit at all, no talk of Self-Realization.

289
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:46,523
In every religion, it is said that you have to get your Self-Realization,

290
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:50,162
you are to be born again, you must be born again.

291
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,957
In America, I met so many people, and they told Me, Mother I am twice born.

292
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,336
I said, how? We belong to an organization that is twice born.

293
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:00,202
I said, the whole organization is twice born or what?

294
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:04,459
And they believe in such mythical things that they are twice born.

295
00:20:04,488 --> 00:20:08,242
I said, what is the sign of a twice born?

296
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:10,237
How can you make out a twice born?

297
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,749
Anybody can stand up and say, I am twice born. Are you going to believe that person?

298
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,317
Some people are so simple that anybody says anything, they just believe them,

299
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,324
but that's not so. A 'twice born'

300
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:24,143
has to be collectively conscious person

301
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:27,262
and a twice born has to give you the power

302
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:33,862
of your Spirit and that when you become twice born,

303
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,974
you should be able to do that to others.

304
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:40,383
Like Blake has said, that Men of God will become Prophets

305
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:44,105
and these Prophets will have powers to make others Prophets.

306
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,880
He said it so clearly for you English people,

307
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,718
but I don't think you people like him very much. Because

308
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:54,279
very few people I have seen, who really appreciate Blake

309
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,783
and some of them have said that he is mad. Naturally,

310
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,796
among all the mad people, a sane person may look mad also.

311
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:02,802
But he is the one who has so clearly said

312
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,893
and in this country, this great man should be born

313
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:08,709
and should talk about Jerusalem is remarkable.

314
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:13,053
Because you cannot think, in England, where people just

315
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,013
believe in dominating other countries and using their

316
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:22,349
power to dominate others, you could get Jerusalem established.

317
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:28,232
But what he said was of these days, when those false ideas have dropped off,

318
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:32,735
when people do not think of domination, they do not think of materialism,

319
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,920
they are fed up with all these things and they are seeking today.

320
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:40,114
And who are these seekers? These seekers are the men of God.

321
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,789
So recognize yourself.

322
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,825
First of all, you must recognize yourselves before recognizing anybody else

323
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:50,577
that you are seekers and that you are men of God.

324
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,771
Unless and until you have found God, you are not going to be happy

325
00:21:55,883 --> 00:22:00,135
by all these nonsensical alternatives people are giving.

326
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:04,590
The other day, I said that there are some people who are just jumping,

327
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:10,082
dancing - is this the way you are going to become twice born?

328
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:13,734
Is absurd. How can you be? How can you believe

329
00:22:13,818 --> 00:22:16,832
that such absurd thing that you can otherwise also do it,

330
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:20,575
if want to jump, what is there, you just lift your leg, you can jump.

331
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,282
What is so great? Is it jumping and screaming and shouting

332
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:29,123
and talking nonsense, is it what you are going to achieve?

333
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:34,842
On the contrary, you are going to achieve something

334
00:22:35,065 --> 00:22:39,305
that will make your awareness much more alert,

335
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:43,049
the awareness that will be collectively conscious.

336
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,559
In your awareness, you should be able to feel others.

337
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,689
You should be able to feel yourself, your own being.

338
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:53,725
And that is what is important.

339
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:58,016
Now, these other methods impress people. 

340
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,350
I don't why this circus impresses them.

341
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:04,301
If they say ten people dancing on the streets, Oxford Street

342
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:07,946
with a dhoti, they are singing "Hare Rama Hare Krishna",

343
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,695
people say, "Oh, ho, oh, what godly, divine people are".

344
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:13,854
They are not to advertise it on the streets of Oxford street and

345
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:17,446
other street and wear those funny dresses and funnily dancing,

346
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,530
is that the way are you going to God?

347
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:25,036
Use your brains. You are one of the brainiest people in the whole world.

348
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:29,092
Use your brains and find out, is this the way are you going to do it?

349
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:35,266
Something has to happen within yourself and that within

350
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:42,199
is just now, the time is today, you have to get it.

351
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:46,479
I am so very happy to see that so many people came today

352
00:23:46,571 --> 00:23:50,381
and that they are so anxious to get to their Realization.

353
00:23:50,473 --> 00:23:53,951
Now, after Realization, when this ascent takes place,

354
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:59,726
when the Kundalini rises and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out here,

355
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:02,765
people may say, what's there in a cool breeze,

356
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,432
now this is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

357
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:09,393
It is all over, all pervading. You can feel it all over, actually some people

358
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,708
start looking at the window, is it coming from the window, if the window is open.

359
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:15,397
it's that. That is clear cut to some people.

360
00:24:15,557 --> 00:24:21,173
Now, when you start feeling it, you must use it. You must establish it.

361
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:25,290
If you start using it, then only you will know the value of it.

362
00:24:25,348 --> 00:24:28,296
If you have not used it, how will you know what is that?

363
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:31,862
This is the Spirit manifesting

364
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:36,546
and you have to find out whether it is true or not by using it.

365
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:40,251
Supposing I give you hundred rupees which is Indian money,

366
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:44,025
then you don't know what rupees are. You must use them in the market

367
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:47,763
and then only you will know the value what it is. In the same way,

368
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:52,937
when I say that the Realization only takes place

369
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:57,272
by only one method and that is the method of Kundalini awakening within you,

370
00:24:57,432 --> 00:25:02,210
like a primule in a seed rises only by one method, there are not ten methods

371
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:07,440
that a seed sprouts. The seed has got a primule which has to germinate

372
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:10,249
and it creates that tree which you see.

373
00:25:10,307 --> 00:25:15,833
Whatever may be the type of trees or anything,

374
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:20,176
its the only the way it germinates is through primule, in the same way,

375
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:24,743
when your actualization has to take place, this Kundalini which is

376
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:27,154
placed at the triangular bone has to rise.

377
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:33,371
And when She rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area,

378
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:38,557
you really get your real baptism. Not artificial.

379
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:43,074
You cannot give an artificial baptism. Actually, Blake has said,

380
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:45,502
the priest cursed me on my head.

381
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:48,543
It's true, because he has no right to touch his head.

382
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,423
He is not a realized soul.

383
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,745
Priest is not a realized soul, they are self appointed. You cannot

384
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:57,748
become a priest in a theological college or anything man made stuff,

385
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,359
it's all artificial. Whatever is man made is artificial, isn't it?

386
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:07,583
Whatever is God made is real and God made things are within you.

387
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:11,463
But after Realization, when you are established,

388
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:15,520
you yourself have supreme powers, you can do so many things

389
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:20,549
after that, that you are amazed at your own powers. You are surprised at yourself,

390
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:24,667
that you are so glorious, so beautiful, so wonderful

391
00:26:24,827 --> 00:26:28,440
and so blissful - you become like a magnet for others.

392
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:32,028
People are surprised at you, all your priorities change,

393
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,426
all your habits drop out, all kinds of nonsensical things

394
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,613
that were so much bothering you just drop off. And with that,

395
00:26:40,011 --> 00:26:44,738
all these centers are enlightened. And every center has a blessing to give.

396
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,244
For example, the Nabhi, that is in the center here, navel center,

397
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:51,489
has a blessing that Krishna has said Yogakshemam Vahaamyaham -

398
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:55,885
that when you get yoga, first yoga, He didn't say Kshema Yoga,

399
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:59,449
then when you get the union, you get the well being.

400
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:03,523
Now well being is your achievement.

401
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,950
Not that you become very rich like Ford, that's extreme,

402
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,715
that's nonsensical, it's a headache. But you get a satisfied person.

403
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,688
You are looked after, God looks after you.

404
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,840
We don't believe in God the way He is really. He is God Almighty.

405
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:23,338
He is God with all the powers

406
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,985
and His power is doing all these wonderful things that we see,

407
00:27:27,485 --> 00:27:30,157
which are living things. Every second,

408
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:34,158
billions and billions of flowers are coming out

409
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:37,549
and you cannot imagine to what extent it is powerful.

410
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,807
And this power when you feel within your reach,

411
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:48,668
you can maneuver it, use it. And be glorified by that.

412
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:56,036
 Sahaja Yoga is here to establish all the religions of the world in one

413
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:01,115
thread - to integrate all of them and integrate

414
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,668
all the great incarnations of the world in one.

415
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:07,742
Because they are within us, they are not separate,

416
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:10,794
they are all together, they are one family,

417
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:16,057
only we come at different levels of our evolution.

418
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:20,237
And have misjudged them, misunderstood them and we are fighting.

419
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:23,301
As I have said many a times,

420
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:26,430
that from the trees, we remove the beautiful flowers,

421
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,667
which are nurtured and nourished

422
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:34,667
and developed by one sap in the tree. And then we fight

423
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:40,092
for these flowers which are dead, ugly that this is mine, this is mine.

424
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:45,687
And that is what is very important to understand that

425
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:51,649
God has created this world not to hate each other,

426
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:56,178
He has created you not to hate each other,

427
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:01,336
but to know how boundless is His love,

428
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:06,630
how eternal is His compassion,

429
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:12,967
how great He is and that with what care He has built you up.

430
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:15,155
You'll be amazed when you get your Realization

431
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:21,411
to see the inner side within you, how it works, how it shows, how it indicates,

432
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:26,218
you can make it out, a person supposing when you ask the person,

433
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,883
this finger is burning you find, you are a realized soul

434
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:32,761
and you ask the person, "What about your father?"

435
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,792
"I have nothing to do with my father now,

436
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:37,281
you see, I am very angry with him, this, that.

437
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:39,344
This finger is burning, this is the father's finger.

438
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:41,973
You have to tell that "You have to forgive your father.

439
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,152
Unless and until you forgive your father, the Kundalini won't rise".

440
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:47,652
She has recorded everything about you.

441
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,316
You have no business to be angry with your father, just forgive.

442
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:53,443
Then the Kundalini rises.

443
00:29:53,943 --> 00:29:57,713
Now, we say Lord's Prayer. Why? For what?

444
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:01,525
What is Lord's Prayer? It is a mantra.

445
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:03,692
It is a chanting at this center.

446
00:30:04,192 --> 00:30:07,313
Without saying Lord's Prayer, if your chakra is caught up,

447
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
you cannot make the Kundalini rise.

448
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,553
It's most surprising, how we are made,

449
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:16,271
all of us together and how we are part and parcel of the whole.

450
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:22,775
It's very surprising, how it acts on us and how it convinces us

451
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:27,622
that what we are doing is the way we have to be.

452
00:30:28,018 --> 00:30:33,646
It's not like any other, so-called God's organization

453
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:37,376
where you can pay some money, become members and you are finished there.

454
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:41,633
Or you dote upon your guru. Your guru is great and this and that

455
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,231
nonsense - this is not that. It is you who has to become.

456
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:48,579
It is you who has to know. It is your own power.

457
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:51,465
And that's what one to understand.

458
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:54,096
Of course, you cannot pay for all these nonsensical things,

459
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:58,648
I mean, I just don't understand that how you pay for these useless people.

460
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:01,077
When you cannot pay for God,

461
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,687
why should you pay these horrible people for anything?

462
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,032
There is no need to pay, but you do, you do pay them.

463
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,893
You think that you are purchasing your guru -

464
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:12,101
any guru who is accepting such a thing,

465
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:16,061
who is purchased, is not a guru but a parasite, he is a regular parasite,

466
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:20,425
nothing but a parasite. There are many parasites out now.

467
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:23,520
Because you are so simple. You are naive in a way

468
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:28,160
that you don't understand a person who belongs to God only gives.

469
00:31:29,452 --> 00:31:32,637
He cannot take. He cannot take anything.

470
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:36,950
Even if you give one thing, He will give you ten things

471
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,594
as a reward of that, so He cannot take.

472
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:43,610
And this is what is so simple to understand.

473
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,263
Everything is extremely simple, but human beings have become rather

474
00:31:47,346 --> 00:31:51,531
complicated and those complications definitely create a problem

475
00:31:51,635 --> 00:31:54,619
for the Kundalini awakening, no doubt. But doesn't matter.

476
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:58,285
Whatever may be the complications, we know all the tricks now.

477
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:00,535
All the permutations and combinations

478
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:03,077
and I am sure, we will be able to work it out.

479
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:06,467
Thank you very much. I would like you to ask Me some questions

480
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,512
before we go further with this. May God bless you all.
