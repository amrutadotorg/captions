00:00.040 --> 00:20.000
Subtitles from 3'26

03:26.621 --> 03:31.930
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

03:32.131 --> 03:34.799
nothing but joy.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.976
It's complete freedom.

03:38.398 --> 03:42.313
So you have all kinds of joys,

03:42.514 --> 03:48.742
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

03:48.943 --> 03:52.763
the joy of the Spirit.

03:54.216 --> 04:00.934
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

04:02.178 --> 04:05.166
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

04:05.367 --> 04:10.140
where you have the joy of the play.

04:13.875 --> 04:20.240
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara it is ‘Nirananda’ -

04:20.441 --> 04:24.472
means, sheer absolute joy.

04:26.109 --> 04:33.366
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name, it means absolute.

04:34.095 --> 04:37.141
So when you put such an adjective before anything else

04:37.222 --> 04:39.165
it becomes absolute.

04:51.863 --> 04:55.542
Thus you become absolute.

04:58.730 --> 05:04.459
And when you are at that state of absolute

05:04.660 --> 05:10.870
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

05:17.512 --> 05:21.543
But let us see what is absolute.

05:26.968 --> 05:31.048
That means it is not relative;

05:31.249 --> 05:33.603
it has no relative qualities.

05:33.804 --> 05:38.954
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

05:39.155 --> 05:41.865
it cannot be compared.

05:43.055 --> 05:47.719
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

05:50.849 --> 05:54.467
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related

05:54.548 --> 05:58.082
to anything else through which we can comprehend;

05:58.283 --> 06:00.962
it is absolute.

06:05.275 --> 06:11.199
Whatever way you try to know it

06:11.400 --> 06:15.610
you go away from absolute.

06:19.033 --> 06:26.518
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

06:36.800 --> 06:42.249
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

06:44.305 --> 06:47.811
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

06:48.012 --> 06:52.150
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

06:52.351 --> 06:56.804
means the anand of the body,

06:58.195 --> 07:05.499
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

07:09.549 --> 07:12.329
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

07:12.530 --> 07:16.920
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

07:18.858 --> 07:22.272
But the state has now

07:22.473 --> 07:26.459
to be established within us is of Niranand.

07:27.732 --> 07:32.185
Then what is the question of fear?

07:34.959 --> 07:37.877
What is the question of talking about it?

07:38.078 --> 07:42.962
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

07:43.163 --> 07:47.647
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

07:49.287 --> 07:52.378
There are no words for absolute to describe.

07:52.579 --> 07:55.198
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

07:55.399 --> 07:58.766
what remains is absolute.

08:02.187 --> 08:06.554
So you reach the state of absolute.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.085
And that is the state

08:12.286 --> 08:17.243
a complete communication is established

08:17.444 --> 08:22.180
and in that communication you have nobody else

08:22.381 --> 08:25.654
but the absolute within you.

08:32.422 --> 08:36.468
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

08:37.335 --> 08:41.842
That is the level to which you should aspire.

08:43.352 --> 08:48.619
That should be the ascent,

08:48.820 --> 08:53.351
which should be established within ourselves.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.902
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

08:57.103 --> 09:00.521
we don't have to do anything drastic.

09:00.722 --> 09:06.183
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

09:06.384 --> 09:10.305
the only, ‘kevalam’.

09:15.106 --> 09:20.395
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

09:22.658 --> 09:29.556
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

09:29.757 --> 09:35.749
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

09:36.362 --> 09:41.088
Just by surrendering you become.

09:42.650 --> 09:46.590
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

09:46.791 --> 09:53.955
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

09:55.236 --> 09:58.645
It is absolute love,

09:58.846 --> 10:02.346
it is absolute compassion;

10:02.547 --> 10:06.377
it is absolute power.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.801
The words stop,

10:22.002 --> 10:26.377
the description stops;

10:28.315 --> 10:31.365
you just become the absolute

10:31.566 --> 10:38.412
and feel your absoluteness through it

10:38.613 --> 10:42.003
with that oneness.

10:43.902 --> 10:48.909
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

10:50.535 --> 10:53.678
There’s no company needed.

10:53.879 --> 11:00.082
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

11:06.010 --> 11:12.554
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

11:12.755 --> 11:19.090
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

11:24.388 --> 11:27.787
May God bless you.
