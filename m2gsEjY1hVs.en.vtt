00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:20.000
Subtitles from 3'26

00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:31.930
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:34.799
nothing but joy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.976
It's complete freedom.

00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:42.313
So you have all kinds of joys,

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:48.742
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:52.763
the joy of the Spirit.

00:03:54.216 --> 00:04:00.934
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:05.166
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:10.140
where you have the joy of the play.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:20.240
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara it is ‘Nirananda’ -

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.472
means, sheer absolute joy.

00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:33.366
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name, it means absolute.

00:04:34.095 --> 00:04:37.141
So when you put such an adjective before anything else

00:04:37.222 --> 00:04:39.165
it becomes absolute.

00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:55.542
Thus you become absolute.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.459
And when you are at that state of absolute

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.870
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:21.543
But let us see what is absolute.

00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:31.048
That means it is not relative;

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.603
it has no relative qualities.

00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:38.954
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:41.865
it cannot be compared.

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:47.719
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.467
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related

00:05:54.548 --> 00:05:58.082
to anything else through which we can comprehend;

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:00.962
it is absolute.

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:11.199
Whatever way you try to know it

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.610
you go away from absolute.

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:26.518
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.249
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:47.811
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:52.150
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

00:06:52.351 --> 00:06:56.804
means the anand of the body,

00:06:58.195 --> 00:07:05.499
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:12.329
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.920
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:22.272
But the state has now

00:07:22.473 --> 00:07:26.459
to be established within us is of Niranand.

00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:32.185
Then what is the question of fear?

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.877
What is the question of talking about it?

00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:42.962
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

00:07:43.163 --> 00:07:47.647
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:52.378
There are no words for absolute to describe.

00:07:52.579 --> 00:07:55.198
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.766
what remains is absolute.

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:06.554
So you reach the state of absolute.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.085
And that is the state

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:17.243
a complete communication is established

00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:22.180
and in that communication you have nobody else

00:08:22.381 --> 00:08:25.654
but the absolute within you.

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:36.468
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:41.842
That is the level to which you should aspire.

00:08:43.352 --> 00:08:48.619
That should be the ascent,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.351
which should be established within ourselves.

00:08:54.468 --> 00:08:56.902
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:00.521
we don't have to do anything drastic.

00:09:00.722 --> 00:09:06.183
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:10.305
the only, ‘kevalam’.

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:20.395
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:29.556
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

00:09:29.757 --> 00:09:35.749
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:41.088
Just by surrendering you become.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.590
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:53.955
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

00:09:55.236 --> 00:09:58.645
It is absolute love,

00:09:58.846 --> 00:10:02.346
it is absolute compassion;

00:10:02.547 --> 00:10:06.377
it is absolute power.

00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:21.801
The words stop,

00:10:22.002 --> 00:10:26.377
the description stops;

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:31.365
you just become the absolute

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:38.412
and feel your absoluteness through it

00:10:38.613 --> 00:10:42.003
with that oneness.

00:10:43.902 --> 00:10:48.909
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:53.678
There’s no company needed.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:11:00.082
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:12.554
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:19.090
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:27.787
May God bless you.
