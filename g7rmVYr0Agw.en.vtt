00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:38.385
It is such a joy to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.999
of such high evolution.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm sure all the gods and goddesses and the God Almighty Himself

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.480
must be overjoyed to see this achievement, no doubt about it.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.840
But I was told that you want to know

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.200
higher ways or higher things

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.720
by which you would like to ascend higher and higher.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.200
In the samadhi state first is the thoughtless awareness as you know,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.999
called the Nirvichara Samadhi.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.080
And then into the other state which is called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.720
where it is doubtless awareness,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.680
is two stages, Savikalpa and Nirvikalpa.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.320
Most of the Sahaja Yogis now, are on the Savikalpa,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.160
not yet at the Nirvikalpa,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.360
and to rise up to the Nirvikalpa

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.280
we must understand that we have to do little more about it.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.400
So far we had our physical problems, which are solved.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:15.320
Physical needs, comforts cannot dominate us anymore.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.760
We can live in any conditions, like Brahmapuri.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.920
We enjoy all that. That shows that we have now risen above

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.600
the conditions that are laid down

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.120
by the material life or the matter.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.520
That's a good state where we have reached,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.200
which is also very difficult for people.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.800
Normally, people are extremely fussy;

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:46.400
they are worried about worldly things, worldly possessions,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.000
worldly material problems.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.160
So many of them would come and tell Me,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.560
"I haven't got this job, I haven't got that job.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.800
This is to be done, that is to be done."

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:00.920
Then the second subtler attachment

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.960
is to our emotional side,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.999
like my mother, like my brother, my sister, my wife, my children.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.240
And we go on bothering Sahaja Yoga for that,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.440
that my friend should be cured, my brother should be cured,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.720
my sister should be cured.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.400
That's a very subtle thing we do not understand,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.360
that in the realm of God those who enter can only be benefited,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.360
not those who do not enter into that.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.160
For example, if you have a relation living in India,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.360
you cannot send him the benefits

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.480
of an Australian citizen. So first of all we must know

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.960
that they have to be the citizens of God's realm.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.800
So unless and until we give them Realization,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.999
take them to that level, they are not entitled.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.920
So we should not have any obstinacy about it, no obstinacy.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.360
Many of you have overcome that part

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.960
that you are not attached to a particular type of a relationship

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.560
who are not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.840
Many of you have got out of it.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.240
But then how to overcome higher attachments?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.280
Like there are attachments

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.560
that "I should write a book on Sahaja Yoga"

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.080
or "I should",

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.520
"I should paint something for Sahaja Yoga",

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.760
"I must earn for Sahaja Yoga", "I must do this for Sahaja Yoga".

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.880
This is also, in a very subtle way is ego,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.840
that "I should be the leader of Sahaja Yoga".

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.880
Then there are jealousies.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.800
If Mother says this is not good, you feel hurt.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.560
If Mother says this is good, you feel happy.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.680
That means you are still at a very subtler state of ego

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.320
where you think, that whatever you say should be approved by Me.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.200
That is something is very subtle, and we do not understand

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.240
that if Mother is not approving of it, there must be

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.240
basic divine reason,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.680
otherwise why should I not approve of it?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.160
So when you have such subtler attachments also,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.600
of a higher level we should say,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.560
you must know that it's all the work of God

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.360
and we are just channels in the hands of God.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.520
Now, we have a very good example, as I have told you many a times,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.080
of the little cell at the tip of the root of a tree,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.560
how it is so wise to avoid whatever is hard

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.960
and to take to whatever is soft and to embed the tree into the soil.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.080
It has that innate wisdom with which we also are endowed.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.440
And we have to work it out in such a way

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.040
that we do not get involved

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.200
into anything which is extremely hard.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.680
Like, I would say, some people wanted to go to Tasmania.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.040
By My hint I told them, "Don't go. It won't work out.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.160
Tasmania is not a place where you can achieve anything."

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.400
I knew it was impossible.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.720
But they thought they are going to do Sahaja Yoga great job,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.120
so they went there.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.280
They came back all possessed in a bad shape,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.240
and then I had to get them all right.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:57.640
So now you people don't misunderstand Me so much, as you used to,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.160
but still you do things which should not be done.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:10.200
To understand that whatever I tell you is for your ascent,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.720
you need a kind of a state of mind,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.440
a state of mind which is a detached mind.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.160
And the detachment is visible,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.000
very clear-cut in a person

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.520
that he's neither very emotionally attached

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.200
or he is neither, nor very physically attached

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.800
but he sees that the progress

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:40.840
of himself and of the society is the point.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.760
Like the cell,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.760
knows it has to progress for the betterment of the tree

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.560
but it has innate wisdom to do it in such a way

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.240
that it never harms himself

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.360
or does not harm the tree.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.880
So the progress of a mind

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.920
which wants to develop, has to be such

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.440
that you should move with a balance, with a witness state,

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.240
and see for yourself how far you should go

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.720
and how far you should not go.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.800
Going to extremes is not Sahaja Yoga style. Ascent is.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.680
So even if you find somewhere,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.720
you go and find that there is no response,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.840
then you must know that it is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.000
nothing wrong with you, but perhaps

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.160
you have not approached the right place

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.560
or you have not approached the right way,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.200
you have not done the way it should have been.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.240
So change your style.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.080
In Sahaja Yoga we have to go on changing our directions

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.480
according to the need of the hour.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.240
You are not fixed quantity, rigid quantity

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.640
Most of the people think that we are so rigid

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.880
that we cannot move this side or that side.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:22.040
The mobility of our movement is so great,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.040
I say 360 degrees.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.440
Because you are stationed in the center in your Spirit.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.000
You can move anyway you like

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.680
as long as you are centered in your Spirit.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.040
But this is an important point which we miss

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.960
that we are centered in our Spirit.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.520
And whatever movement we do,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.800
as long as we are centered in the Spirit,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.200
is necessary for our growth and for the growth of the collective.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.360
Now let us see certain emotional sides we have,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.200
how we can conquer. It's very simple is.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.120
You are very fortunate, I should say, in a way,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.400
than any other seeker so far

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.999
because you have before Me Myself sitting.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.560
I am sitting before Myself and I see Myself

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.320
as a good example of following.

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:22.999
When you have someone like that, it's very simple to see.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.520
People didn't have any such people or some leaders

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.080
or somebody who was an ideal.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.680
So, it was all right that they went wrong.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.120
But those who have something before them, that's very simple.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.440
The secret is like this,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.880
now when you are subtly attached to something,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.960
so to say an emotional side of something

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.600
or you always like to be on the negative side

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.320
or too much of a positive side

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.999
in the sense that you aggress others,

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.400
then you must discriminate.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.440
If it is an aggressiveness that you see in yourself,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.840
witness within yourself, then you aggress yourself.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.400
That is the best way to get rid of it.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.040
If you are a hot-tempered person,

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.280
better get angry with yourself at least ten times

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.960
and then you will see that your temper will mellow down,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.240
because all that is coming out will be directed towards yourself.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.480
Now this is the discrimination you have to use

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.640
and be honest about it.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.120
The another side could be that you are very left-sided, emotional,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.999
extremely emotional about things and you cannot get over.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.280
Then that's the best. Divert your emotions to Me,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.440
put your emotions to Me, but do not aggress Me.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.800
This is the discretion you have to use.

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:01.800
When you have aggression, you aggress yourself

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.760
and when you have emotional attachments, direct it.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.360
It's very simple to do.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.440
What pleases Mother? Very simple things. What does it please Her?

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.400
Very simple things pleases Her, like flowers.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.320
Now people say that, "We were going in the garden, Mother.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.880
We found these flowers for You." Is good idea.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.040
But how much attention you have put to it

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.720
that we have to give a flower to Mother.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.920
Now what flowers She likes? She likes fragrant flowers. All right.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.999
From where should we get the fragrant flower? It's very simple.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.680
It's a shop. When you are going around, be on the look-out.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.600
There must be some shop with fragrant flowers.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.720
In those months what flowers come in?

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.720
What flower am I going to give to Mother?

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.360
The whole direction changes.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.200
You see, you become so beautifully attached to Me,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.080
and I have to gain nothing out of it

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.280
but by attaching yourself to Me, you gain something.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.440
Like the river Ganges flows,

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.600
and if you dip in the River Ganges,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.640
the poor river Ganges doesn't get anything

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.760
but you get the blessings of river Ganges.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.720
In the same way you have to think

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.040
that if we have to attach ourselves to Mother,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.720
we must put our attention completely, entirely to it.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.240
Little, little things you do. What should I do for my Mother?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.680
How should I please? Is not what you give Me is important.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:28.280
It is how much heart you put into it.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.160
You know the story of Shabari. She was a very simple woman,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.760
an old lady with very few teeth.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.760
When Rama was coming she said, "What should I give to Shri Ram?"

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.960
All right, she went round and round. There were, in the forest,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.880
some small little what we call berries, ber, and she thought,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.720
"It may not be sweet for my Rama. How will I give Him?"

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.920
So she picked them up. She used to test it with her teeth.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.680
One tooth she used to pierce in it and see if it is sweet.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.480
And then she would collect those

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.280
and those who were bad she threw away.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.680
When Shri Ram came, she said,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.920
"Shri Ram, I couldn't get anything but these for You.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.000
Will you have it?" Now, Shri Rama, being an incarnation,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:24.080
knew the depth of the love of this lady. He took it up in His hand.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:29.960
He knew that this is given by great love of a great heart.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.160
So she says, "This I have tasted each one of them.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.600
Don't have any doubts. I have tasted in every one of them.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.880
They are all very sweet. You can have them."

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.960
So He puts it in the mouth, tells His wife,

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.680
"I have never eaten such beautiful fruits such great fruits before."

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.720
I mean, it's such a simple fruit, you see.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.400
Sitaji, His wife, being an incarnation Herself, She said,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.960
"You must give Me some. After all, I am your Ardhangini" -

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.400
is the half, better half.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.080
But Lakshmana was getting angry.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.000
He said," Who is this old woman sitting here and giving such ..."

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.520
We don't eat things, you see, eaten by others; we call it tustha,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.360
is a uthistha, means if the one who has eaten something

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.640
is never given. And to Rama.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.560
So he was very angry, fuming with temper.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.800
So She takes it in Her hand and She tells Her brother-in-law,

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:28.640
"Oh, this is the best I've had, my brother-in-law.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.360
I've never had such beautiful fruits."

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:36.400
Now he gets tempted and he says, "Really?

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:41.120
Can I have some?" She said, "No it's only for Me and My husband.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.960
You better ask her." So He asks Shabari,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.960
"Can you give Me some, please?"

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.680
The whole temper fizzles out and then He sees

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.000
the beauty of that fruit because it is done with love.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:03.040
So this is what it is. Love which you have should be expanded.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.600
And very simple. If you are attached to Me I am a person

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.400
who is so much spread out, all over. It goes into the whole,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:18.280
it goes into the nature, it permeates everywhere.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.800
Whatever love you give Me is not like a drop in a ocean

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:26.080
but is this ocean in a drop.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.600
And that is what we must understand how to love Mother.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.800
But when you love Me, you won't feel bad if I tell you something,

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:35.960
"This is not good for you, you should all not have done it,"

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.280
because if you want to be all right, you would say,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.320
"All right, Mother, this was wrong. All right, I am sorry.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.600
I'll never do this again."

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.600
This is a very simple way but it is a very difficult thing

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.200
for a human being. Is so simple.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.999
I asked Warren that "Are they prepared to take up what I say?"

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.640
Then you will be surprised, when we are in love with someone,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.840
we don't mind how we cross the roads, how we go there,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.720
how we have to cross floods, this, that.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.920
That force of love takes us there. In the same way,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.440
the force of love for water,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.760
for the whole tree, takes that little root - that innate wisdom

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.480
is nothing but the love he has for the whole tree -

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.440
that he goes to the water, sucks it in for that great tree.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.920
It's not that it is important for the tree.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.440
If there is no one tree, one root, doesn't matter.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:39.640
But it is the wholesomeness of existence

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.800
that one feels when we become one with the whole.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.840
And this wholesomeness is to be felt

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.960
and that's the greatest enjoyment.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.840
The wholesomeness is to be felt within yourself.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.720
Is the greatest enjoyment, and that is how

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.880
we progress higher and higher.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.480
So the Savikalpa is this that we are still busy

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.880
with our relationships.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.840
We, we notice that Mother has married us,

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.960
given us good husbands, good wives. We are very happily married

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.840
and we are enjoying our married life and we are looking forward

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.080
to greater marriages and better marriages.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.320
But that's not the end of it, not at all.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.560
This is just the beginning, just the start

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.720
and after this has happened,

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.080
if you get attached too much to it, then you have lost the point,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.920
lost the point. The marriage has taken place.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.440
Like an electricity, you see,

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.600
if you plug it to the mains,

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:46.000
it is not for getting attached to oneself,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.120
but it is for the use of that instrument.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.840
So the marriage is an instrument which is to be used,

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.160
which is to be completely understood

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.520
for the purpose of enlightening others.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:08.760
So first thing is that Sahaja Yoga is our aim,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.680
is our dharma, is our being.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.320
That is the main thing. All the rest of the things come later.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.400
Supposing then, you find your wife or your husband

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.160
are getting materialistic, better to depart.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.040
Tell them, "No, we cannot." See, for Me this is important.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.640
Marriage was just a means to an end. But the end is different.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.440
So we can give up this means, we'll have another means.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.080
And this is to be understood in its true color.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.440
If your marriage doesn't give you progress in your spiritual life,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.280
better to give it up.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.760
And that's what I have been telling everyone about it,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.040
how to get over your emotional problem.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.040
Some people have aggressiveness in them.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.160
Now when they are aggressive

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.480
then what happens that some people ...

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.999
I told you you'll get breeze; you are getting the breeze, all right.

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.680
And look at the shade.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.440
You see how the nature, how the nature acts, how the nature helps.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.200
Just look at the nature, how subservient it is. It enjoys that way.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.320
You must have heard about what happened in Perth,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.120
what happened everywhere.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.320
See, the nature is so subservient. Why? What is the need?

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.960
Because it gets the blessings. It gets the beauty of wholesomeness,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.560
of doing something for the whole. This is the wholesomeness.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.040
The wholesomeness of the whole job is to be understood

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.760
and when it is understood, then only you realize

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.240
the beauty of you being Sahaja yogis.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.280
Otherwise you just, for a limited thing, ”I got married,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.960
I am much better, I got rid of my bad habits".

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.760
That's not sufficient.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.600
The quality of wholesomeness, when is experienced within ourselves,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.160
then only that joy comes in.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.160
So we go up to a point and then we recede.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:12.160
Like the sea, it goes up to a point and then recedes.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.160
It does not go beyond a certain point.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.280
It has its own maryadas. It knows how far to go.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.480
But what does it do? It ascends as clouds.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.400
It purifies itself, ascends as clouds and then meets

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.560
the Himalayas and then you get the rain

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.120
for the benefit all the others. It's a big circle that is made

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.200
and the wholesomeness of that circle is realized by the sea.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.240
In the same way, you must know that

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.400
you are in that great circle of nature

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.080
where you have to play your own part in a full way,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.360
and once you realize that mentally,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.200
you should put it in your heart, the way I've said it.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.760
Because to put it in the heart for some people is very difficult.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.840
Like, they'll do My Puja, all right,

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.520
is mechanically, but some people may not even do any Puja,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.520
they sit before the photograph and talk to Me heart-to-heart,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.560
without saying anything.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.280
And even in puja, when I see people doing Puja,

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.720
I know how far they are dedicated because the way they do it

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.680
with caution, with care, with awe, with understanding.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.400
Everything is so beautiful. But if somebody is doing

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.280
just a ritual thing, I get a fright. I just don't understand.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.520
Now next time he might hit My Foot or something like that.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:39.000
So one has to be all the time ascending.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.200
Ascent has to be achieved and that ascent is only possible

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.400
when we start giving up all these ties and tags that we have.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.880
These ties and tags keep us down.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.080
So get over the ties and tags.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.840
The other day I was telling Warren that, you see,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.720
men and women after forty-five or fifty

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.760
still go on thinking of marriages. It is too much.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.680
It's all right. After forty also one should be all right

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.960
but at least forty-five, fifty.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.880
But even at sixty years somebody comes and says,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.600
"Mother, get me married." Then I really get fed up.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.120
As if My job is to get you married, like a clergyman.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.800
So this is not the way. What is in a marriage?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.640
Some people are seeking their husbands all their lives.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.800
When are you going to seek the real one that is your Spirit?

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:29.920
So that category of people have to come up

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.160
and work it out in that manner.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.240
Then only our family, our relationships,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.640
our society will have some meaning in the realm of God.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.120
Otherwise, it has no meaning. We have to be meaningful to Him,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.480
not that He should be meaningful to us.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.440
We should change our attitude towards Him,

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.840
that "What has God done for us? Let's see."

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.600
We should say, "What have we done for God?

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.160
What have we done for God?"

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.520
Then you will get ideas, what is to be done, how to spread out,

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.240
how to go ahead, how to work it out.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.120
But still there are limitations, I know.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.960
Some people have limitations.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.600
They have limitations because they have a background.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.160
Some of them come from countries which has a background.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.320
And also the other one is that

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.160
the problem of these people, delimiting others.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.120
When they come in contact with you, they try to delimit,

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.040
by their talks, by their, I should say,

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.480
talks without understanding what they mean,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.040
some sort of frivolous, sarcastic things.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.160
And people get impressed by such people. And if you get impressed

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.880
then you should know you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.720
A Sahaja yogi is to be known by his character,

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.200
by his righteousness, by his behavior.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.560
The behavior of a Sahaja yogi should be

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.280
extremely a peaceful behavior, peaceful.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.040
Sahaja Yogis who are just rushing up and down, upset,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.040
are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.880
Peaceful. Now how do you get your peace?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.360
Peace comes from your Spirit.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.680
Because you know you are in your Spirit.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.960
You know that you are one with God Almighty.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.920
What is there to hurry?

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.760
Where is He going and where are you going? You are together.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.880
Whatever is there, you are there.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.080
So what is there to hurry? What is there to just

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.800
hasten something or get upset?

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:38.280
Peaceful personality comes when you say, "No, not this."

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.960
When, when the haste start, then you should say,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.960
"Not this, not this, not this."

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.480
Another could be that when you see somebody

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.320
whom you don't like or who has been harsh to you,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.320
who has been cruel to you, you get annoyed.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.920
And then again you will get disturbed.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.480
At that time: "I forgive. I forgive. I forgive."

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.480
Main thing is, you have to be peaceful. Not that some people say

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.920
that "Mother, I try to forgive. It's difficult to forgive."

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.040
It's all mythical you know that very well. But what you have to say:

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.720
"I forgive. I forgive. I forgive," if there's disturbance.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.120
Mine is another case. Supposing I see somebody who is a rakshasa,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.840
then, you see, a kind of a thing builds in Me, which I don't know

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.960
what you should call in human words, but we can say

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:38.960
anti-forces against that person, like tremendous vibrations.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.520
And when they are released, you see, they engulf that rakshasa.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.120
He goes down in his own estimation, in the estimation of others.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.720
Somehow or other, he gets destroyed.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.320
In a modern way, he is not killed but in a way he is killed.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.680
So this is what happens but that may not be with you.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.680
So, what you have to do when you start feeling anything

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:05.600
anger against, say, some very devilish guru, supposing,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.560
then you build it up in yourself and that built-up anger within you

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.640
will neutralize that fellow. You need not say it out.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.920
You need not talk about it, but that built-up anger

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.360
will little bit trouble you also because it has a little reaction.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.600
but when it is released it will have an effect

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.720
and such a person cannot stand a Sahaja yogi.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.760
You see, there are so many things that happen,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.000
automatically they'll happen.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.880
As you know that I had told people that

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.760
”Don't bring Rajneesh people to Me". But they wouldn't listen to Me.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.280
They brought three people in a program. And three of them collapsed,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:48.040
collapsed just like a big boulder,

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.160
and I didn't know what to do with them.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.920
So they were really literally taken off

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.880
as you would take out a big stone.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.560
So, in that case I didn't get angry. I didn't do anything,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.240
but as soon as they came the built-up force within Me

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.120
just froze them completely. I didn't do anything.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.720
On the contrary, it was disturbing our program

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:19.120
but the built-up force could not wait; it just froze them.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.000
So this is what is the other side of it,

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.440
that even if you hate any guru, you don't like him

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.160
because he has been so unkind, build up that force.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.000
For that you need strength, because it's painful little bit.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.800
Build up that strength within you, to hold that sword in your hand.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.120
Then you get the sword and then you cut him off,

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.200
without doing anything. He is just cut off.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.960
So going to that limit where we find

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.320
that some people are so sinful,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.080
so horrid, so devilish that they should be punished, no doubt.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.800
But for that you don't punish. Let the Divine do it.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.800
But your force built-in within yourself can do it.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.880
You should try all these things within yourself

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.960
and see it works out.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.680
Now, for meditating, many people think that,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.800
four o'clock get up, do this, this that, and it's very difficult.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.080
In the beginning. There's no need for you to get up

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.840
four o'clock otherwise, but in the beginning it is necessary.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.040
Because - why I say, get up four o'clock -

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.440
you are such, such slaves to your sleep

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.840
because you sleep such a lot.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.960
Early in the morning you sleep such a lot.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.040
So just to overcome that habit of yours

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.200
of sleeping, of sloth, you should be able to get up anytime

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.160
that you have to get up because we are on war.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.560
We are on war path. Which time is free for us?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.880
Anytime, whether I sleep or I am awake, I am fighting.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.200
I don't find even a single minute that I am not working.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.600
So this is what it is. You have to get up in the morning

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.960
because you have to train your body, "Better behave yourself."

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.840
Supposing your body cannot sleep on the ground,

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.600
make your body sleep. Let's see what happens.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.000
This is a tapasya. This is the penance

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.000
through which the Sahaja yogis have to go

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.520
that they make their body their slaves in the sense that

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.880
they can use that body. That doesn't mean tomorrow I want you

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.240
to be sitting on the bed of thorns

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.480
and I have to always take the extreme side to which you people go.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.360
But if your body tries to be funny, better tell the body,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.560
"You behave yourself. What do you mean? Why can't you do this?

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.200
Why can't you do that?"

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.400
There are so many habits we have, which we should avoid.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.360
Some people have habits of coming forward too much all the time,

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.280
to be in the public to be there all the time, this, that.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.040
Tell yourself, "There's no need." If you are called, you better go.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.840
Detach yourself from yourself and see for yourself.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.520
As I said, I see Myself sitting before Myself.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.280
In the same way, you see yourself sitting before you

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.000
and you tell yourself very clearly,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.880
"Now, this is not the way it is to be done.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.440
This is not the way. This is not Sahaja."

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.960
Why are you going forward all the time?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.760
Why are you trying to show off?" Better rebuke yourself.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.200
This is what I said, aggression to yourself.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.920
And tell yourself that you have to be like a Sahaja yogi.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.800
Sometimes I find people laugh at wrong times,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.640
they cry at wrong times,

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.600
they do things at wrong times.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.600
It's done, is done. Don't worry about that, but next time ...

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.640
Why did I do it? All right, next time I am not going to do this one.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.320
This I did because I wanted to show off

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.320
or I was emotionally disturbed at the wrong time."

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:47.760
But the expression of love is very spontaneous.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.920
But that spontaneity to come you must get rid of your habits.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.760
Otherwise you can never become spontaneous.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.960
A person who has got habits cannot.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.680
The other day I was giving a lecture

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.240
and one fellow got up and went out

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:05.880
while just meditating, because he wanted to smoke.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.680
So you can imagine, because of habits how we sacrifice

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.920
something that is so important, something so auspicious.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.720
You can realize it that your habits within yourself are built-in

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.400
because there was no tradition of dharma also.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.240
If there's a tradition of dharma, then what happens,

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.200
as I told the other day, explained to them,

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:36.880
that the fat cells in our stomach get the experiencer,

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.400
charmed, with the sense of virtue,

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.800
righteousness, of goodness, of innocence.

00:33:43.999 --> 00:33:46.680
But if that is not so, it's like a dead ...

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.480
another cell going in the head

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.320
and experienced in dirty things, in doing dirty things,

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.440
in doing something that is destructive.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.360
All these modern methods are destructive.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.760
And then you get only the sensation from that

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.800
because it's a dead stuff, it needs a sensation all the time,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.800
and they start doing all these things.

00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:09.720
But now with the Kundalini awakening your dharma is built in.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.520
Your cells are charmed by that.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.760
So you use that power to enlighten your brain

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.640
which surrounds actually, as auras over the heart.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.000
It's such a mutual understanding between the two

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.999
but you have to establish that mutual understanding.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.680
Our idea is that

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.800
by God's grace we are so many,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.360
and if we want, we can transform the world.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.600
We can bring peace, joy and bliss to this world.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:52.640
We could be blissful if we count our blessings.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:59.800
And you'll be joyous if you get rid of your tags.

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:04.640
We'll have to fly, then only we can be joyous.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.640
And for this we have to have our balance, our ascent

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.960
and then the desire to fly into the whole universe.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.800
How to do it, you can find out yourself. It's not difficult.

00:35:20.999 --> 00:35:24.280
How can I do it? Face yourself, find out about yourself.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.400
Don't justify yourself. Don't be miserable.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.480
Some people identify themselves with miseries

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.200
and like to enjoy their miseries.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.600
Stupid things these are, absolutely.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.280
Such miserable looking people have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.280
So, you have to be joyous, happy, balanced, well-behaved, sober.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.400
Outwardly it will show whatever is inward.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.080
All your dignity will express, if there's dignity.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.720
See if you just have a dignity outside, it will drop out in no time.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:59.800
So all these things can be built from inside out, not outside in.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.120
And once they are built outside also, then they are best.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.800
But outside, what we have to do is to put ourselves outside,

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:14.800
that's all. "Now Nirmala is sitting there. I am sitting here.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.440
Now Nirmala tells Me, then I tell Nirmala.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.720
"Let's work it out that way. And when we work it out,

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.800
then things will be very easy because now you have

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.080
a state where you are separated from yourself.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.440
So that is the state of Nirvikalpa

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.200
where you are not attached to anything.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.440
You don't have any habits, you are not attached to anything,

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.400
you have no diseases, you have no troubles,

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.400
you are above everything. You do not try to

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.840
complicate things for Me. You do not try to say things more than Me.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.760
You just take it a hint, sufficient, "Mother said so. All right."

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.040
But some people have another bad habit,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.480
"Mother said so. So this is so."

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.400
Use your discretion. How can Mother say? If She has said something,

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.280
there must be something in it, must understand.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.680
Like Warren asked Me, "Mother, should I marry?"

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.040
I was stunned, you know, I was stunned.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.280
But I didn't know how to tell him or ...

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.880
I said, "As long as you think you'll be happy, it's all right."

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.760
I mean any person, at that time who was not so mad,

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:23.520
could have seen the point, but that time he wouldn't understand.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.200
In the same way, with everyone it happens

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.320
that when I tell you something, you don't understand.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.000
Most of the marriages have failed where you have said,

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:35.400
"I want to marry someone," ninety-nine point nine.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.480
When I have said you marry someone

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.360
because you have been living with that person, something,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.880
such marriages also have failed, I have seen.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.000
But mostly the marriages we have chosen do not fail

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.040
because there's a divine hand. It's all planned out.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.999
May God bless you all.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.000
There's one more thing, is a good news for all of you

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.760
which I must tell you,

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.680
is this that now I feel  that you all are at such a stage

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.320
when I say something, it acts on you.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.240
You raise. You are raised higher.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.480
If I am talking about something higher, it becomes.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.440
Just now it has happened to you, no doubt,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.280
but then you again sometimes come down.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.520
So only you prop up yourself and that's it.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.800
Just now it is at that state you are sitting, no doubt.

00:38:46.999 --> 00:38:49.000
It's something good. I could not do that with people

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.080
who were not realized or just realized,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.800
but with people of your level I can do it

00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:57.400
and many must have felt that way, that we are there,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.440
absolutely there. But again it falls down.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.320
So be careful on that point. So, it's not a serious matter.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.200
It's a thing to be very pleasant and happy

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.640
that we can all of us do it. It's very great.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.440
You don't know, already whatever we have done is very great,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.440
and we have to do greater and greater things

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.480
and that's what is very encouraging.

Now we will say again the mantra of Shri Ganesha.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.280
That water should be kept separately

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.800
and now the water should be just poured in

00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:09.400
