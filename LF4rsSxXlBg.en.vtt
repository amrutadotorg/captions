00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:21.653
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:26.706
I think we have not understood

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:32.354
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:42.197
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:19.083
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:34.949
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:49.643
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

00:01:55.546 --> 00:02:00.016
For example, people have a hot temper,

00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:04.449
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:19.936
And if a person is in a big temper,

00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:25.948
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:28.704
to cool him down.

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:44.053
He organises everything under his own control

00:02:44.213 --> 00:02:47.547
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:52.573
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:09.045
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

00:03:09.748 --> 00:03:15.226
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:17.991
then somehow or other,

00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:21.241
Bhairavnath will organize,

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.518
also with the help of Hanumana,

00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:30.918
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.555
So, for example, people who are depressed

00:03:57.715 --> 00:04:00.350
or who become left-sided,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.476
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

00:04:06.636 --> 00:04:12.836
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:16.955
very much more to come out of it.

00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:37.319
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:45.338
It is very difficult for a person

00:04:45.498 --> 00:04:49.223
who is very left-sided,

00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:55.136
who is all the time feeling very sad,

00:04:55.296 --> 00:04:58.572
unhappy and worried,

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:02.777
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.805
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

00:05:18.965 --> 00:05:21.242
does not enjoy any collectivity,

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:23.895
doesn’t allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

00:05:24.055 --> 00:05:29.123
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:46.855
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:48.878
is something superior.

00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:54.342
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

00:06:02.857 --> 00:06:07.058
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

00:06:07.218 --> 00:06:09.205
all the time thinks,

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:11.962
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.212
I'm so depressed,” this, that,

00:06:14.372 --> 00:06:17.516
all the time expecting from others something,

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:22.969
also cannot enjoy the collective.

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.041
Such a left-sided person will find

00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:49.624
everything is something unhappy.

00:06:57.843 --> 00:07:00.497
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

00:07:00.657 --> 00:07:04.723
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:08.289
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

00:07:15.362 --> 00:07:18.704
So, we went to have our food

00:07:18.864 --> 00:07:23.810
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:35.634
but then a car came in and we went there.

00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:42.736
Then they said that

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:46.024
“You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:50.149
you have to take the seats which were more expensive.”

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:01.270
So this lady started saying,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.553
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

00:08:06.713 --> 00:08:09.945
and we can't get a seat."

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.848
I said, “This is all fun;

00:08:22.008 --> 00:08:24.437
this is not something a problem.”

00:08:24.597 --> 00:08:28.166
This 'problema’ word should be given up.

00:08:36.988 --> 00:08:39.636
This is a new word I have learned,

00:08:39.796 --> 00:08:44.145
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:46.569
in our young age.

00:08:57.067 --> 00:09:00.586
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:03.535
to find everything negative

00:09:03.695 --> 00:09:10.016
is the way we really spoil our left side.

00:09:19.065 --> 00:09:21.663
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:27.390
and he said, “We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.’

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:39.826
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

00:09:39.986 --> 00:09:41.396
everything was fine.

00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:43.820
I said, “See now, you were only counting

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.212
how many negative things there are,

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:59.450
and you were not seeing the fun.”

00:10:04.952 --> 00:10:06.870
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:10.158
“You take Bhairava's name,

00:10:14.757 --> 00:10:16.745
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:18.632
and right hand on the Mother Earth

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:22.837
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away.”

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:32.666
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

00:10:32.826 --> 00:10:35.956
always light in His hand.

00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:44.605
And He runs up and down

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:51.895
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

00:10:59.086 --> 00:11:03.753
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

00:11:07.731 --> 00:11:11.683
One of the negativities are that,

00:11:11.843 --> 00:11:15.160
"This is mine",

00:11:18.804 --> 00:11:28.526
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my …”

00:11:33.469 --> 00:11:35.802
So then, you see, once you get attached

00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:39.141
in this manner, what you find,

00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:45.536
that your children also become negative.

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:59.274
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

00:12:02.627 --> 00:12:08.051
And for that you should see, ‘Where is your attention?”

00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:13.986
Are you only seeing problema

00:12:14.146 --> 00:12:18.321
or you are seeing some fun in it?

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:32.292
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

00:12:35.444 --> 00:12:41.718
If it’s a sunny day they’ll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:51.233
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

00:12:51.393 --> 00:12:53.465
"Oh, what a day!"

00:12:57.344 --> 00:13:00.390
Nothing can please them.

00:13:01.651 --> 00:13:07.853
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:11.578
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:25.429
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:31.582
Also, it’s not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

00:13:31.742 --> 00:13:34.940
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.256
then how can there be ignorance?

00:13:45.156 --> 00:13:51.600
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.037
if you hide, run away,

00:13:54.197 --> 00:13:58.424
you will say that there is negativity.

00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:07.913
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

00:14:08.073 --> 00:14:13.478
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

00:14:18.438 --> 00:14:22.867
So those people who cannot become collective,

00:14:23.027 --> 00:14:28.963
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

00:14:36.707 --> 00:14:43.549
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:52.433
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

00:14:54.846 --> 00:15:01.287
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

00:15:04.363 --> 00:15:09.510
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.809
They are drunkards, all drunk,

00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:15.815
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:20.040
When will this end?"

00:15:29.482 --> 00:15:31.984
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

00:15:32.144 --> 00:15:37.233
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:48.671
Then the third one says,

00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:53.105
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

00:15:55.635 --> 00:16:02.608
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:13.218
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:22.374
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:26.464
They cannot see fun at all,

00:16:26.532 --> 00:16:29.817
they cannot enjoy at all,

00:16:33.206 --> 00:16:35.660
and they become very,

00:16:35.764 --> 00:16:38.234
sort of think they are very meditative,

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:42.200
they are some higher people, they are something superior

00:16:42.186 --> 00:16:45.330
in negativity.

00:16:57.352 --> 00:17:02.451
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

00:17:05.254 --> 00:17:11.012
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:18.942
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

00:17:21.288 --> 00:17:24.584
and while going there I met a lady,

00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:27.452
and she was quite all right, I mean,

00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:29.977
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

00:17:30.065 --> 00:17:33.361
so I started talking to her.

00:17:41.044 --> 00:17:43.053
And she started talking very wisely,

00:17:43.213 --> 00:17:45.592
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

00:17:45.752 --> 00:17:49.071
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:50.938
and we should not do this, that..."

00:17:51.098 --> 00:17:55.195
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

00:18:02.806 --> 00:18:06.326
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:09.943
and no one loves her.

00:18:16.006 --> 00:18:19.937
And she said, “I'm very insecure” and this and that.

00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:27.465
Suddenly the doctor came in

00:18:27.898 --> 00:18:31.476
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

00:18:31.636 --> 00:18:34.822
I said, “What's this?”

00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:44.260
So the doctor sent for people that,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.969
"Catch hold of this woman!"

00:18:46.129 --> 00:18:50.303
He told Me, “She's the most violent lunatic

00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:59.446
and why are You talking to her?”

00:19:00.128 --> 00:19:05.970
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:12.854
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

00:19:13.014 --> 00:19:15.072
run away and were playing tricks,

00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:19.801
but you can see that, clearly.

00:19:25.718 --> 00:19:28.298
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:32.348
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

00:19:32.508 --> 00:19:37.026
you see, “This is my child, this is my this thing,

00:19:37.186 --> 00:19:38.862
this is this and this is that,”

00:19:39.022 --> 00:19:41.670
and all the time wasting your precious life

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:46.961
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

00:19:57.857 --> 00:20:00.207
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:04.147
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:10.613 --> 00:20:12.304
So, one has to know that

00:20:12.464 --> 00:20:16.651
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

00:20:20.015 --> 00:20:23.670
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:30.970
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

00:20:37.134 --> 00:20:40.430
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

00:20:41.955 --> 00:20:46.709
and funny ideas about attachments

00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:53.481
and also the depressiveness.

00:20:55.136 --> 00:20:56.691
So, today we are, I am very happy

00:20:56.851 --> 00:21:00.591
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

00:21:00.751 --> 00:21:06.119
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

00:21:12.007 --> 00:21:15.509
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:19.778
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

00:21:19.938 --> 00:21:23.962
and goes to the right side.

00:21:30.466 --> 00:21:34.874
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

00:21:35.034 --> 00:21:41.727
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

00:21:49.317 --> 00:21:54.454
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

00:21:54.614 --> 00:21:58.515
which is really Swayambhu.

00:22:02.278 --> 00:22:04.793
And people are more left-sided,

00:22:04.953 --> 00:22:08.519
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

00:22:12.598 --> 00:22:16.483
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

00:22:16.643 --> 00:22:19.350
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:24.895
and put His light there, make a flame.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.727
I mean, the police takes them,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:42.219
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:52.608
And they confess what wrong they have done.

00:22:52.768 --> 00:23:02.460
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

00:23:02.567 --> 00:23:06.121
sly things like thieving.

00:23:13.594 --> 00:23:16.656
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

00:23:16.816 --> 00:23:21.049
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

00:23:27.381 --> 00:23:32.459
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:41.007
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:48.928
So, today we are here to worship

00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:51.530
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:56.263
who incarnated on this earth later on,

00:24:04.222 --> 00:24:07.730
ultimately as Mahavira also.

00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:13.622
So, He stands on the gate of hell

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:20.668
and stops people from falling into hell.

00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:27.590
But if you want to go to hell,

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.878
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:32.585
that I should go to hell,then He says,

00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:36.634
‘All right, you can go.’

00:24:42.875 --> 00:24:49.345
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

00:24:53.164 --> 00:24:59.246
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:06.310
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:22.631
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

00:25:22.791 --> 00:25:28.055
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:44.537
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:54.700
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

00:26:03.258 --> 00:26:06.828
May God bless you all.
