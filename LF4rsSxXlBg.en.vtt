WEBVTT

00:10.949 --> 00:21.653
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:22.861 --> 00:26.706
I think we have not understood

00:26.858 --> 00:32.354
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:32.514 --> 00:42.197
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

01:12.247 --> 01:19.083
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

01:24.509 --> 01:34.949
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

01:41.765 --> 01:49.643
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

01:55.546 --> 02:00.016
For example, people have a hot temper,

02:00.176 --> 02:04.449
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

02:12.917 --> 02:19.936
And if a person is in a big temper,

02:20.096 --> 02:25.948
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

02:26.153 --> 02:28.704
to cool him down.

02:37.036 --> 02:44.053
He organises everything under his own control

02:44.213 --> 02:47.547
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

02:47.707 --> 02:52.573
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

03:04.973 --> 03:09.045
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

03:09.748 --> 03:15.226
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

03:15.386 --> 03:17.991
then somehow or other,

03:18.151 --> 03:21.241
Bhairavnath will organize,

03:21.401 --> 03:24.518
also with the help of Hanumana,

03:24.678 --> 03:30.918
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

03:52.469 --> 03:57.555
So, for example, people who are depressed

03:57.715 --> 04:00.350
or who become left-sided,

04:00.510 --> 04:06.476
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

04:06.636 --> 04:12.836
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

04:12.996 --> 04:16.955
very much more to come out of it.

04:29.361 --> 04:37.319
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

04:42.124 --> 04:45.338
It is very difficult for a person

04:45.498 --> 04:49.223
who is very left-sided,

04:49.383 --> 04:55.136
who is all the time feeling very sad,

04:55.296 --> 04:58.572
unhappy and worried,

04:58.732 --> 05:02.777
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

05:15.289 --> 05:18.805
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

05:18.965 --> 05:21.242
does not enjoy any collectivity,

05:21.402 --> 05:23.895
doesn’t allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

05:24.055 --> 05:29.123
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.855
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

05:47.015 --> 05:48.878
is something superior.

05:49.038 --> 05:54.342
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

06:02.857 --> 06:07.058
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

06:07.218 --> 06:09.205
all the time thinks,

06:09.365 --> 06:11.962
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

06:12.122 --> 06:14.212
I'm so depressed,” this, that,

06:14.372 --> 06:17.516
all the time expecting from others something,

06:17.676 --> 06:22.969
also cannot enjoy the collective.

06:40.719 --> 06:43.041
Such a left-sided person will find

06:43.201 --> 06:49.624
everything is something unhappy.

06:57.843 --> 07:00.497
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

07:00.657 --> 07:04.723
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

07:04.883 --> 07:08.289
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

07:15.362 --> 07:18.704
So, we went to have our food

07:18.864 --> 07:23.810
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

07:32.077 --> 07:35.634
but then a car came in and we went there.

07:39.923 --> 07:42.736
Then they said that

07:42.896 --> 07:46.024
“You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

07:46.184 --> 07:50.149
you have to take the seats which were more expensive.”

07:59.449 --> 08:01.270
So this lady started saying,

08:01.430 --> 08:06.553
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

08:06.713 --> 08:09.945
and we can't get a seat."

08:19.770 --> 08:21.848
I said, “This is all fun;

08:22.008 --> 08:24.437
this is not something a problem.”

08:24.597 --> 08:28.166
This 'problema’ word should be given up.

08:36.988 --> 08:39.636
This is a new word I have learned,

08:39.796 --> 08:44.145
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

08:44.305 --> 08:46.569
in our young age.

08:57.067 --> 09:00.586
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

09:00.746 --> 09:03.535
to find everything negative

09:03.695 --> 09:10.016
is the way we really spoil our left side.

09:19.065 --> 09:21.663
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

09:21.823 --> 09:27.390
and he said, “We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.’

09:37.168 --> 09:39.826
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

09:39.986 --> 09:41.396
everything was fine.

09:41.556 --> 09:43.820
I said, “See now, you were only counting

09:43.980 --> 09:48.212
how many negative things there are,

09:55.759 --> 09:59.450
and you were not seeing the fun.”

10:04.952 --> 10:06.870
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

10:07.030 --> 10:10.158
“You take Bhairava's name,

10:14.757 --> 10:16.745
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

10:16.905 --> 10:18.632
and right hand on the Mother Earth

10:18.792 --> 10:22.837
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away.”

10:29.428 --> 10:32.666
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

10:32.826 --> 10:35.956
always light in His hand.

10:40.942 --> 10:44.605
And He runs up and down

10:45.111 --> 10:51.895
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

10:59.086 --> 11:03.753
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

11:07.731 --> 11:11.683
One of the negativities are that,

11:11.843 --> 11:15.160
"This is mine",

11:18.804 --> 11:28.526
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my …”

11:33.469 --> 11:35.802
So then, you see, once you get attached

11:35.962 --> 11:39.141
in this manner, what you find,

11:39.301 --> 11:45.536
that your children also become negative.

11:51.445 --> 11:59.274
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

12:02.627 --> 12:08.051
And for that you should see, ‘Where is your attention?”

12:11.411 --> 12:13.986
Are you only seeing problema

12:14.146 --> 12:18.321
or you are seeing some fun in it?

12:27.029 --> 12:32.292
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

12:35.444 --> 12:41.718
If it’s a sunny day they’ll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

12:46.662 --> 12:51.233
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

12:51.393 --> 12:53.465
"Oh, what a day!"

12:57.344 --> 13:00.390
Nothing can please them.

13:01.651 --> 13:07.853
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

13:08.013 --> 13:11.578
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

13:18.861 --> 13:25.429
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

13:27.994 --> 13:31.582
Also, it’s not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

13:31.742 --> 13:34.940
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

13:35.100 --> 13:39.256
then how can there be ignorance?

13:45.156 --> 13:51.600
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

13:51.760 --> 13:54.037
if you hide, run away,

13:54.197 --> 13:58.424
you will say that there is negativity.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.913
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

14:08.073 --> 14:13.478
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

14:18.438 --> 14:22.867
So those people who cannot become collective,

14:23.027 --> 14:28.963
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

14:36.707 --> 14:43.549
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

14:48.301 --> 14:52.433
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

14:54.846 --> 15:01.287
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

15:04.363 --> 15:09.510
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

15:09.670 --> 15:11.809
They are drunkards, all drunk,

15:11.969 --> 15:15.815
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

15:15.975 --> 15:20.040
When will this end?"

15:29.482 --> 15:31.984
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

15:32.144 --> 15:37.233
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

15:47.335 --> 15:48.671
Then the third one says,

15:48.831 --> 15:53.105
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

15:55.635 --> 16:02.608
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

16:07.033 --> 16:13.218
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

16:16.461 --> 16:22.374
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

16:23.911 --> 16:26.464
They cannot see fun at all,

16:26.532 --> 16:29.817
they cannot enjoy at all,

16:33.206 --> 16:35.660
and they become very,

16:35.764 --> 16:38.234
sort of think they are very meditative,

16:38.370 --> 16:42.200
they are some higher people, they are something superior

16:42.186 --> 16:45.330
in negativity.

16:57.352 --> 17:02.451
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

17:05.254 --> 17:11.012
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

17:14.988 --> 17:18.942
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

17:21.288 --> 17:24.584
and while going there I met a lady,

17:24.744 --> 17:27.452
and she was quite all right, I mean,

17:27.612 --> 17:29.977
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

17:30.065 --> 17:33.361
so I started talking to her.

17:41.044 --> 17:43.053
And she started talking very wisely,

17:43.213 --> 17:45.592
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

17:45.752 --> 17:49.071
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

17:49.231 --> 17:50.938
and we should not do this, that..."

17:51.098 --> 17:55.195
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

18:02.806 --> 18:06.326
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

18:06.371 --> 18:09.943
and no one loves her.

18:16.006 --> 18:19.937
And she said, “I'm very insecure” and this and that.

18:23.581 --> 18:27.465
Suddenly the doctor came in

18:27.898 --> 18:31.476
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

18:31.636 --> 18:34.822
I said, “What's this?”

18:41.458 --> 18:44.260
So the doctor sent for people that,

18:44.420 --> 18:45.969
"Catch hold of this woman!"

18:46.129 --> 18:50.303
He told Me, “She's the most violent lunatic

18:56.715 --> 18:59.446
and why are You talking to her?”

19:00.128 --> 19:05.970
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

19:10.159 --> 19:12.854
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

19:13.014 --> 19:15.072
run away and were playing tricks,

19:15.232 --> 19:19.801
but you can see that, clearly.

19:25.718 --> 19:28.298
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

19:28.458 --> 19:32.348
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

19:32.508 --> 19:37.026
you see, “This is my child, this is my this thing,

19:37.186 --> 19:38.862
this is this and this is that,”

19:39.022 --> 19:41.670
and all the time wasting your precious life

19:41.830 --> 19:46.961
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

19:57.857 --> 20:00.207
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

20:00.367 --> 20:04.147
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

20:10.613 --> 20:12.304
So, one has to know that

20:12.464 --> 20:16.651
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

20:20.015 --> 20:23.670
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

20:23.830 --> 20:30.970
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

20:37.134 --> 20:40.430
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

20:41.955 --> 20:46.709
and funny ideas about attachments

20:50.151 --> 20:53.481
and also the depressiveness.

20:55.136 --> 20:56.691
So, today we are, I am very happy

20:56.851 --> 21:00.591
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

21:00.751 --> 21:06.119
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

21:12.007 --> 21:15.509
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

21:15.669 --> 21:19.778
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

21:19.938 --> 21:23.962
and goes to the right side.

21:30.466 --> 21:34.874
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

21:35.034 --> 21:41.727
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

21:49.317 --> 21:54.454
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

21:54.614 --> 21:58.515
which is really Swayambhu.

22:02.278 --> 22:04.793
And people are more left-sided,

22:04.953 --> 22:08.519
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

22:12.598 --> 22:16.483
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

22:16.643 --> 22:19.350
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

22:19.510 --> 22:24.895
and put His light there, make a flame.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.727
I mean, the police takes them,

22:35.840 --> 22:42.219
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

22:47.542 --> 22:52.608
And they confess what wrong they have done.

22:52.768 --> 23:02.460
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

23:02.567 --> 23:06.121
sly things like thieving.

23:13.594 --> 23:16.656
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

23:16.816 --> 23:21.049
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

23:27.381 --> 23:32.459
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

23:35.123 --> 23:41.007
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

23:44.816 --> 23:48.928
So, today we are here to worship

23:49.088 --> 23:51.530
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

23:51.690 --> 23:56.263
who incarnated on this earth later on,

24:04.222 --> 24:07.730
ultimately as Mahavira also.

24:08.864 --> 24:13.622
So, He stands on the gate of hell

24:16.567 --> 24:20.668
and stops people from falling into hell.

24:25.191 --> 24:27.590
But if you want to go to hell,

24:27.750 --> 24:30.878
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

24:31.038 --> 24:32.585
that I should go to hell,then He says,

24:32.745 --> 24:36.634
‘All right, you can go.’

24:42.875 --> 24:49.345
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

24:53.164 --> 24:59.246
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

24:59.406 --> 25:06.310
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

25:18.759 --> 25:22.631
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

25:22.791 --> 25:28.055
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

25:37.085 --> 25:44.537
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

25:47.570 --> 25:54.700
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

26:03.258 --> 26:06.828
May God bless you all.
