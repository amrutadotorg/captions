00:00:01.222 --> 00:00:08.222
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:19.165
At the
very outset we have to know that truth is

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:32.285
what it is. We cannot organize it, we cannot
mold it. Also we cannot know it at the stage

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:40.365
when we are human beings, with human awareness
we cannot know it. So we have to become a

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:49.092
super human being, a higher personality. What
is said that you have to be the Spirit, you

00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:58.854
have to be the Self. In all the scriptures,
in all the religions it has been said that

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:08.174
you have to be the Spirit. I mean we see the
turmoil and the problems of the world that

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:18.744
are completely show us clearly that there
is so much of a mess and most of them are

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:28.989
the problems created by human beings. We have
to do some introspection and some soul searching

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:37.435
and we have to find out, after all, why we
human beings have created all these problems

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.695
for ourselves. We have had philosophies, we
have ideologies, we have so many kinds of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.965
enterprises but despite that there are so
many differences and the differences are having

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:09.344
larger and larger gaps. If it is the truth,
it has to be the truth for everyone. Everyone

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.035
has to say: "This is The Truth". But it has
to be the Absolute Truth. If it is not the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:26.485
Absolute Truth then what we believe into is
not the reality. And this is the main reason

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.500
why everything in the name of God, Divinity,
everything has failed so far because it is

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.160
not substantiated by reality.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:45.505
First we must feel the reality. And what is
the reality, and what is the truth? The truth

00:02:45.552 --> 00:03:00.850
is that you are the Spirit, you are the pure
Spirit. And that there is All Pervading Power

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:10.645
of divine love which does all living work.
Now we see all these beautiful flowers, beautifully

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.340
arranged, everything, but we never think how
so many flowers have come out of one seed.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.445
How it has worked? This living work is done
by whom? We will say: "The Mother Earth".

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:34.264
But the Mother Earth seems to be just... just
a thing... it is just a matter. Than how these

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:40.480
flowers have sprouted from a little seed,
who has done this work? We don't even think

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:50.440
who has done the job of making us human beings
from ameba stage. So for a hypothesis let

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:59.404
us think there is something, some power that
is doing it. As scientists you must keep your

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:07.363
minds open. There is no use having blind faith
in Me, in Sahaja Yoga, in anything because

00:04:07.388 --> 00:04:14.860
blindness will never give you reality. But
you should be open like scientists are and

00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:25.755
whatever hypothesis I am putting before you,
you have to feel it on your central nervous

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.220
system.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.595
This is what is the Bouddha, is what is Buddha
preached about that you have to feel the All

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:50.055
Pervading Power on your central nervous system.
And the time has come. Time has come for all

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:01.083
of you to feel that. You all can feel that
All Pervading Power, the power of the Holy

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:09.725
Ghost, power of the Primordial Mother. And
then, once you are in connection with that,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.160
like this instrument when it is connected
to the mains it has a meaning, your self-knowledge

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.375
will tell you what is the meaning of your
life. Otherwise, there is no meaning. We are

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.984
without any connections to the reality and
that's why we do not know where are we drifting,

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:39.009
what is happening to us, where are we going.
Now, I verily say to you that within us lies

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:48.442
this instrument. And this instrument is very
well intact in all of you.

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:52.632
Now, there are some people who have written
books after books which have

00:05:52.657 --> 00:05:56.129
really shocked Me saying that

00:05:56.154 --> 00:05:59.424
is very dangerous to raise
the Kundalini, some people have said that

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.819
Kundalini is in the stomach - shows they are
unauthorized people or perhaps they do not

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:12.080
want you to have your self-knowledge, they
want to deviate you. Also you will find people

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.940
who will tell you that you should not do this
Kundalini awakening and all that because very

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:27.715
dangerous and this brings problem. Not at
all. This Kundalini which is in three and

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:41.135
a half coil is an energy of Pure desire within
you. All other desires rise within us and

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:49.095
once we achieve them we still are not satisfied
we are going from one desire to another. So

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.120
the law of economics is that in general desires
are not satiable.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:06.245
So this is the only power which has to rise
and give us that Pure desire that once we

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:18.897
achieve it or once we manifest it then all
the desires become absolutely of no value.

00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:25.430
Then this madness of desire goes away and
we understand all this transitory things,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:37.225
all this pleasures of life with it's full
limitations and we know how far to go with

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.690
them.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:45.114
But first we must seek the Eternal, we must
seek this All Pervading Power which is very

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:53.582
subtle and is all around us. But as human
beings are as you must have seen here also,

00:07:53.607 --> 00:08:01.834
on top of your head here is on one side is
the yellow ego; on the left side is your superego

00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:11.185
- is your conditionings. We have so many conditionings
in our mind. To say that I am an Indian and

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:17.480
you are British or you are this and you are
that is a conditioning. God never created

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:25.134
world like that, He created only one world.
We have made it like this. This is the one

00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:29.780
world, this is another world, this is another
nation. We human beings have done - created

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:38.345
problem for us. Of course, I mean He did create
rivers and mountains and He did create different

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:45.370
type of people otherwise we all would have
looked like some military junta. But no He

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:56.025
made us differently to look different. That
was His idea to create beauty. Why we have

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:01.890
such conditionings, from the very childhood
we have conditionings of this kind, then we

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.600
think we are born in a particular religion.
So that is one another horrible conditioning

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.766
we have that we have got we are in this religion
so we must follow this religion. But in Sahaja

00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:20.290
Yoga when you come you will be amazed to see
that those people who started all these religions

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:28.655
are the real people and once they started
it after some time is drifted into something

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:35.755
extremely nonsensical and now running away
from religion also you can not solve the problem

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:44.355
or running towards is just the same. So what
is it that you have to go beyond all these

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.370
conditionings that are there and also beyond
your ego.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:56.220
Now, the ideas about ego are also prevalent
and people say that these are our karmas,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:04.085
we must suffer. I know of so many people who
say that: "Mother what about karmas". Now,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:09.890
the yellow stuff that you see there is the
ego, is the only human beings think that they

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:16.620
have done some bad karmas or good karmas.
Animals don't think. They are under the complete

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:23.620
control of God that's why they are called
as pashu means paash - completely controlled.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:29.800
A dog is a dog, a scorpion is a scorpion and
tiger is a tiger. They behave the way they

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:37.875
are, but human beings are everything in them.
You may find somebody as a very nice dog and

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:45.205
suddenly becomes a snake. From where does
it come in? It comes because still all these

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:52.230
conditionings that are within us are built
in and then also this ego that has come into

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:58.800
us that I am doing this work, I am doing that
work. Now, see we have a beautiful hall of

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.460
course to be appreciated very much and we
should say that it's a very good piece of

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:10.779
art or whatever it is. But something like
a tree was dead, so we have made this platform

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:18.155
from dead to dead. We have done no living
work whatsoever, we cannot do it. But when

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:25.885
the Kundalini rises you will be surprised
in many people who have problems on their

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.561
centers you can see with
naked eyes the pulsation

00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:32.700
and on your hand you
can see the pulsation

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:39.700
of the Kundalini rising and you can feel the
pulsation on top of your head here. And when

00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:45.110
the pulsation disappears you feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head, out of your

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:54.655
own head. All these things are to be verified.
There cannot be pretensions about it, reality

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:07.205
stands by itself, it does not need any support.
So when all this happens to you, what you

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.320
get- the self-knowledge.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:17.160
And what is the self-knowledge is to first
of all to know about your own centers. Now,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.930
a person gets lunatic without knowing that
he is getting lunatic, a person gets cancer

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:30.200
without knowing he has got cancer. Whatever
happens to him, he does not know what is happening

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:36.030
to him. He has to go to doctors, spend lot
of money, everything and then the doctor certifies

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:44.385
no you have these ten diseases in you and
that now you will die after one month or so.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:50.330
You don't know how it has developed in you,
how it has come suddenly to you but when these

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:57.230
centers are out of gear then you feel this
is wrong with you, that is wrong with you.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:02.580
Because you are realized soul and you can
feel it on your fingertips when the centers

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:10.675
tell you that this is wrong with you. This
is not only on physical side, physical side

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:17.320
is the minimum that you get, but you find
out about emotional side, you find out about

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:23.570
your spiritual side also very clearly that
spiritually where are you. Just to certify

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:30.330
yourself that we are twice-born people or
we are this and this is misleading yourself.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.320
You've not been kind to yourself, I should
say, and not honest to yourself.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:42.475
We have to be honest, we have to find the
truth and we have to get to it, because it

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:51.265
is our own, this is our right to have it as
human beings and you cannot pay for it. One

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:58.755
thing if you understand you cannot pay for
it, you will understand what is reality. Like

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:08.195
the seed you plant in the Mother Earth. How
much do we pay to Mother Earth? How much did

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:15.805
we pay to Christ? How much did you pay to
Rama or Krishna? To any one of them how much

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:27.238
did we pay? But those who are now commercialized
all these ideas we are just getting lost into

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:37.335
it. So we have to, little bit, have a soul
searching and find out: "Where am I ?" I have

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.690
to find the truth and I must get to it.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.810
This is the time when the whole world has
to emancipate, this is the resurrection time

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:52.890
or we can call it this is this Last Judgment.
But you will be judged by your own Kundalini

00:14:52.890 --> 00:15:00.195
who is your Mother. She doesn't trouble you.
When you were born your mother took up all

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.790
the trouble, all the labor pains upon herself,
she didn't trouble you. In the same way this

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:12.790
Kundalini doesn't trouble you and she is anxiously
waiting. I'm Myself amazed the way these days

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.730
the Kundalini is rising. Of course today we
have so many people I am sure you all will

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:23.510
get realization. But in a place like Paris
where I never had such hopes thousand people

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:29.610
getting realization I was amazed at that and
all of them full of joy, laughing, I have

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:38.615
never seen French women laughing that much.
They never laugh normally. I was amazed that

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.250
all there cheeks were up there, up to their
eyes and I said: "What's the matter?"

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:49.960
They said, "Mother, we don't know from where
this joy is pouring".

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.710
That's the quality of the Spirit that you
start feeling so joyous and the joy doesn't

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:03.545
have the duality of happiness and unhappiness.
It's singular. You just feel it from within

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.113
yourself, you enjoy yourself.

00:16:21.016 --> 00:16:25.005
Then another quality of the Spirit is that when it comes

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:30.900
into your attention- the light of the Spirit
comes into your attention. Let's supposing

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:35.590
this room is completely dark, we don't know
how we relate to each other, where we are

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.610
sitting, if we start walking we might tumble
over other people, we may try to trample some

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:48.165
people. But if there is light you see, you
know where you are sitting, where others are

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:55.875
sitting, what is your chair, what is their
chair. So in that light of Spirit you develop

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.980
a new awareness, a new dimension which we
call as collective consciousness, which is

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:09.635
described by Jung very clearly. Jung has talked
about this and that is what happens to you,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:16.570
it is not a false thing that, 'Oh! I am collectively
conscious'. No, it happens to you. Means you

00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:25.764
can feel the chakras of another person, you
can feel what's wrong with him and you know

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:36.139
how to correct it. Under your hand itself
the Kundalini will rise, you get the powers,

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:41.630
you get your own powers to raise the Kundalini,
give realization. I mean, now I cannot go

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:47.250
all over the places, Sahaja Yogis are doing
this work. You all get those powers of raising

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:53.362
the Kundalini and giving realizations to others,
so that they find their own self, their own

00:17:53.387 --> 00:18:03.495
Spirit. So, the absolute knowledge can be
only known through self-realization, because

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.260
whatever you want to ask like a computer,
the answer comes in.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.650
There is somebody who met Me in Paris. He
said: "I don't believe in God".

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:19.570
I said: All right, you ask a question to Me:
'Mother is there God?'. Stretch the hands

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.062
towards Me, ask the question three times.

00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:24.634
"Mother, what's happening? This cool breeze
coming"

00:18:24.659 --> 00:18:30.090
I said: "The answer has come, there is God".

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:37.635
So absolute knowledge is only possible when
you know the Absolute Truth and to have the

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:43.670
Absolute Truth you have to go to the Absolute
Being within you which is your Spirit. So,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:53.995
it gives you the Truth, it gives you the collective
consciousness. The main thing is that you

00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:03.235
become extremely peaceful personality, you
become peace, you emit peace. It's like the

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:09.720
wheel, the wheel at the periphery moving very
fast but in the center of the wheel is the

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:20.305
axis, it has to be silent otherwise cart won't
move and you jump onto that point within yourself

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:28.765
where you are completely peaceful with yourself,
completely integrated without any tension,

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:36.985
without any problems. And these other ideas
of removing tensions, this thing, that thing

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:44.945
are all artificial and mental. It cannot be
mental, it is beyond mental. When the Kundalini

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:50.940
rises as you see there this is the center
in the optic chiasma - Agnya chakra. When

00:19:50.940 --> 00:20:00.395
it crosses that center then these two institutions
are sucked in and she passes through the limbic

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:09.443
area and comes out of your fontanella bone
area, which is the actualization of your realization.

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:14.655
Also in India, they called it Brahma[...] all kind of nonsense
have been done in that name

00:20:14.688 --> 00:20:17.473
everyway, in every religion.

00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:23.007
So, now for it is absolutely

00:20:23.032 --> 00:20:32.325
evident for people to see that we have to
get to that stage and you have all the properties,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:37.123
all the possibilities, everything within yourself
to get to it.
