00:00:46.100 --> 00:01:01.540
Please be seated.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:25.229
So nice to see you all here.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:02:00.159
This time now again is to have a very informal
talk between the Mother and Her children,

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.950
you can say.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:54.580
And for that, I was thinking of getting about
five or six people from various countries

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:11.609
to be seated here, and who all –
Hello, how are you?

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.870
Sahaja Yogi: Very good Mother.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.770
Shri Mataji: Nice to see you.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.770
Who’ll ask questions to them.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:36.019
And I want to watch what sort of questions
you ask, what sort of answers you get.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:50.449
And of course, I’ll also be able to answer
some of the questions.

00:03:50.449 --> 00:04:13.290
And how to answer the question of a person
who is not yet Realized, is half-baked, and

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:22.690
how to handle the situation.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.889
We have to learn, that is very important.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.740
Because you have to know that negativity is
in complete force all the time.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.330
And we have to face the negative ideas, negative
people, negative plans.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:50.630
And when they plan, it is necessary – please,
come, all of you-

00:04:50.630 --> 00:05:13.830
It is necessary for all the Sahaja Yogis that
they should be equipped– Move forward.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.360
Sahaja Yogi: Come forward.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:25.790
Shri Mataji: They should be so equipped that
they should be able to face sometimes [inaudible].

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:45.830
There can be many like that you meet, who
are seekers, who have been seeking, who have

00:05:45.830 --> 00:06:03.630
been doing lots of mistakes and who have conditioning
problems and it’s not easy that kind of

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.510
confrontation you get.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:14.230
Then also you get some funny sort of people
who are in Sahaja Yoga for some time and somehow,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:15.290
they cannot manage to get up.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.000
Very low graded people I should say.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.970
And really, you get disgusted with them.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.230
That’s the second style of people.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:43.050
Because God’s work today is to save as many
people as possible, that’s the work we have

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.110
to do.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:58.520
But there are all kinds of mental projections
and hangs-up and all that.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:06.900
And the first thing they do to attack is a
question.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.740
Then there are suggestions.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:16.830
Then there can be actual fighting.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:37.410
I had such a one very recently which I must
tell you, the most interesting one.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:46.610
That’s Peggy and you know Peggy, how she
is.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:55.070
Nobody needs worry about her.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:19.720
The kind of a quality she is, you know, we
have told her that we don’t want her anymore.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:31.570
In Sahaja Yoga, we do not ask people to come.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:52.620
They come to us, we don’t force them, and
if they are hopelessly bad then we say, “All

00:08:52.620 --> 00:09:03.130
right, we’ve had enough of it now, please
forgive us”.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:16.880
And they get out of Sahaja Yoga, you see,
mostly, this is how it works out.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:27.430
Because we have to choose, you see, that’s
what we have to do with people.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:45.450
There can be very high-quality people and
there can be very cheap type of people also.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:58.709
Now, Peggy everybody knows has been with us
for five or six years.

00:09:58.709 --> 00:10:15.050
And she has been to horrible places and has
a funny type of a personality, I don’t know.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:20.639
If God has made her, I don’t know how He
has made her that way.

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:28.140
She’s been to all kinds of wrong stuff,
absolutely horrible things, filthy, dirty.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:36.709
She has been a married woman with three children
who are Realized souls.

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:47.910
Now my interest was in her about her children
because we knew about her but her children

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.889
were very good.

00:10:49.889 --> 00:11:00.790
And when she came to Me, I told her that,
“See, we can’t do much about you, I’m

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:01.790
sorry.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:09.880
But in a way, but you have to work hard if
you are willing to cooperate” “Oh, I’m

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.649
willing to cooperate, Mother, I want to say
I’m willing to."

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:25.029
Then I discovered that she was actually ill-treating
her husband, ill-treating her children.

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:37.619
Every time I tried to raise her Kundalini,
it was a big labouring thing, I mean it’s

00:11:37.619 --> 00:11:43.009
a very hard work with such people.

00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:56.980
I used to say, “Oh God I hope next time
I don’t see her face somehow, it’s too

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.139
much”.

00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:14.079
And the whole attention goes to something
so nonsensical and useless person.

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:28.490
I mean, in that time we can give Realization
to so many people.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:41.379
And
she would attract the sympathy of some here

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:42.660
and there.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:55.060
Then ultimately, I raised her Kundalini thrice
and I told her, “You’ve got, you’ve

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:05.739
touched your Realization but you have to now
promise Me that you will not ill-treat your

00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:08.980
husband and not ill-treat your children”.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:24.009
And she said, “Mother you have to promise
me that my Realization will be established”.

00:13:24.009 --> 00:13:35.779
I said, “All right, promised, but you must
promise Me this.

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:39.759
Start it that way.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:49.980
Imagine to be ill-treating your own husband
and your own children!

00:13:49.980 --> 00:14:06.670
I mean, I haven’t got sufficient time to
be with my children, to express my love.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:18.399
And here is a person, sitting down quietly
with three children and just thinking how

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:22.199
to torture them.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:33.600
A very difficult case I felt with this woman.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:47.519
Very fond of living like a lady-like personality,
this and that.

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:53.860
But she couldn’t do that.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:15:03.480
Every time her Kundalini fell down.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:33.439
You see, she used to think that she’s obliging
Me all the time, that’s her funny stuff.

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:52.869
And she thought that I promised her and how
is it not established?

00:15:52.869 --> 00:16:09.129
And then, I think people told her that you
better not come to Sahaja Yoga, we have had

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:10.129
enough.

00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:13.279
She stopped the children, she never brought
them.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:15.130
I said, “All right”.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:27.019
But, you see, negativity is such that they
know they have no personality.

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:32.660
Otherwise, without Sahaja Yoga what is their
personality?

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.249
They are nothing.

00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:48.589
So, she tried to assert herself all the time
and this time she appeared where we had gone

00:16:48.589 --> 00:16:54.480
and she just came by herself.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:07.250
I never called her nor asked her to come but
she was there.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:15.100
And I asked Rita, how is she here?

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:24.990
She said, “Mother she is here because she
said that You told her”.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.990
I said, “I?”

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:35.890
She said, “Yes, You were in her head and
told her”.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:46.900
I’m neither in her heart nor in her head
[laughter].

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:54.760
So, how am I going to tell her?

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.400
So, she came in.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:07.789
Now, I found that Rita had a weakness for
this lady.

00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:14.540
So, something was to be done because I wanted
to save Linda.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:33.760
My foot went absolutely crazy with this lady,
I told her not to come in, what to do?

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:44.559
But the Divine has its own methods and she
suddenly got exposed completely.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:53.299
And Rita was shocked with the way she was.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:19:14.710
Because she just started fighting with Me,
absolutely fighting with Me.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:23.820
And so rude and so shameless.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:31.070
Rita couldn’t believe her eyes.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:20:23.429
So, I was very happy in a way, she said, “[inaudible]
is over, ” because she was always pestering

00:20:23.429 --> 00:20:26.720
me.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:57.610
And I told her that, “If Mother doesn’t
want and if it is not allowed, how can I do

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.160
it?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:36.700
And she always used to say, “Do this, do
that”.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:22:42.389
Now, why I am telling you this story is that
when she went to India, everybody resisted

00:22:42.389 --> 00:22:47.210
her.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:23:46.980
And in England, you see, Sahaja Yogi come,
you know, are very eager to develop Sahaja

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:53.950
Yogis and she was literally frightened of
them because she was quite aware of the nonsense

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:59.470
that she was having and her cunning and all
that.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:04.279
And it came up to this point with the way
she behaved there and the way she created

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:15.539
scenes and things and all such nonsense, that
they said to Me, “We are going to book her

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:16.639
back.

00:24:16.639 --> 00:24:35.320
She has to go back otherwise, we throw her
in the sea, Mother we can’t have her."

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:45.210
[Shri Mataji is laughing] I said, “It’s
all right”.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:25:04.870
Now, the main thing that we have to understand
is that how much time do we spend with these

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.870
people?

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:10.750
We must learn how much, we must judge the
depth of a seeker.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:18.379
That’s very important because we haven’t
got time to waste much.

00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:28.100
And if you don’t get anybody in England
anymore, let’s go to India.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.539
If not, India let’s go to China.

00:25:32.539 --> 00:25:43.330
We have to gather human beings; we are not
bothered as to what country them come from.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:54.780
You have to weigh first of all the quality
and you’ll find, you’ll be amazed, those

00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:04.270
people who think to be very much qualified,
you’ll find them to be useless people.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:08.870
And the Divine will not help you.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:19.289
The best part is that the Divine will not
help you.

00:26:19.289 --> 00:26:36.120
It will be angry with you for wasting your
time on such a person.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:45.770
And as you will be growing, you will definitely
use this discrimination within yourself and

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.820
you will understand.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:54.379
You will not waste your energy with someone
like that.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:27:01.950
All these ideas of being kind to everyone
is not for us.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.830
We have to be kind to ourselves and to God.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:14.059
All such useless people have to go out of
the circulation of evolution.

00:27:14.059 --> 00:27:21.940
Absolutely, there is no doubt about it.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:33.970
This is what I want to tell you that today
I want you to ask the questions.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.330
That’s important.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:49.889
And when you’ll ask the questions, I will
see how they answer.

00:27:49.889 --> 00:28:18.559
Now to be positive, a person has to see how
the question is asked and how it is answered.

00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:24.820
It’s not a question of your mind, it’s
a question of spirituality.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:30.840
The question is from spirituality to spirituality.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:55.980
It’s not from one mind to another mind,
and I would like to see that how it works

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:02.639
out with Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:02.639 --> 00:29:46.250
Because I know you
are people of very high quality and that’s

00:29:46.250 --> 00:30:01.730
how I know all this great work will be done.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:21.840
In one year, I have seen people they have
come up so much.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:31:25.450
They have come up so much, they have gone
so much up and they have done so much.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:32:06.269
But there are some who are struggling and
they cannot come up.

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:22.440
Some people don’t feel vibrations, it doesn’t
matter.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:44.600
Need not feel vibrations constantly, maybe
some physical problem is there or some sort

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600
of problem is there.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:33:12.529
But the main thing is the attitude of a person
is important and negative people are there

00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:31.360
to take our time, to divert our attention.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:34:04.320
They’ll go into tantrums and show-off, they’ll
do this, they’ll do that, and they’ll

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:28.310
try to divert out attention to them, attention
from the Spirit, attention from our ascent,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:35.080
attention from our work that is so important,
the emancipation of the whole humanity.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.730
So, we must understand that our lives are
valuable lives.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:37.980
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.320
We are workers of God.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:50.780
Our Kundalini has risen, we are Realized souls
of a very high quality and we have not to

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:57.680
waste our energy to people who do not deserve
our attention.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:05.120
That’s very important, between you and Me,
I am telling you this story.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.270
It’s all right what I do.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:12.890
It’s different, I play quite a lot of things
with them.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:19.030
And I see to it that they get out.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.660
But you please don’t waste your energy.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:41.660
If you find somebody difficult, funny, better
give up that person.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:50.360
Now with this idea, we’ll have about one
person from every country.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.550
They’ll sit down here and I would like to
see.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:36:00.110
You should all ask questions.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:11.630
Questions, not material, but about Kundalini,
about what answer to be given because now

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:25.711
as you are going in the fields, you know people
ask you questions, and what questions they

00:36:25.711 --> 00:36:42.690
ask, and how to answer these questions, so
we can sort it out just now.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:37:00.470
Because sometimes, they can be so aggressive
that you can be just dumbfound.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:09.030
But as I said, after a certain time, you should
just give them up as lost.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:13.850
It’s not our responsibility to give Realization
to everyone.

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.340
It’s not expected.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:26.230
It’s only those who deserve that will get
it.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.020
It’s the deserving quality of people that’s
important.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.490
If they are not deserving, we are not interested
in them.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.280
We are sufficient already.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:53.580
Better– I always say that those people who
are to enter into the Kingdom of God should

00:37:53.580 --> 00:38:17.260
only enter and not every Dick, Tom, and Harry.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.870
It’s important.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:57.300
So, those people who cause problems, just
do it to because they attract our attention.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:22.370
And Sahaja Yoga, you know, as it is, it’s
very different from other so-called organizations

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:27.560
of God.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:47.300
Here the genuineness is judged by vibrations
and by attitude of yourselves.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:53.560
You have to be extremely positive.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:40:12.800
I’ve seen even some cancer patients who
came to Sahaja Yoga who are so very positive,

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.200
it’s surprising.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:59.560
And some people, for nothing at all, they’re
wasting your time and energy.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:17.600
So, the interest should be for the people
who are of [that] quality and not for people

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.940
who are just wasting our time and energy.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:35.410
It’s a kind of an ego within us there I
think that we try to correct people who are

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:39.300
good for nothing.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.510
We cannot.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:56.110
It’s all right, they are hard nuts, but
why do we need to break our teeth for that?

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:05.100
This is what I want to tell you.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:30.730
After this experience, now, Rita has said,
taken a vow that she’ll have nothing to

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:36.600
do with Peggy.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:58.290
And she always used to peg her down to Me
every time.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:31.270
Rita used to telephone to Me about her, she
used to tell Me, “Mother please look after

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:38.600
her, all the Sahaja Yogis are angry [laughter]”.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:50.870
Especially, she said, “People have told
her off and cannot come to the programs”.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.320
That’s how it was.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.510
So, thank God now she’s corrected.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.830
I’ve tried my own ways.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:28.520
But you can directly understand and know that
you know in your heart who is settled and

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.500
who is not settled.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:40.970
You know very well about everyone.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:46.430
You are quite capable.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:45:23.230
But if you try to be extreme, “Now, let
it be, let it be, it’s all right”.

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:29.250
They are no good.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:33.760
They can never come out.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:39.400
So why waste your energy?

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:57.350
Simple thing is that whether you are good
or bad, or if your heart is like that– just

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:02.750
the same.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:13.870
As Sahaja Yogis, we have to realize our position.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:20.820
The work is very important.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:47:10.800
It’s not that we are here for England or
America or for China, we are for the whole

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.930
world.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:42.440
Whenever we can get people of that quality,
we are going to collect and decamp.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.200
All right?

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.970
[laughter]
Now.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:48:23.460
So, I would say that we get some people here,
like from every country that- you’ll be

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.620
there.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:42.940
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, maybe Bryan could come
first.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:51.590
Shri Mataji: Bryan also.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:49:30.540
No, Bryan should ask the questions first of
all, then I will put you down in his place

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:39.190
and he can switch.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.360
[laughter].

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:50.010
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:50:17.190
Then, now we’ve got Kamala [unsure] from
England and we have to answer, you see.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:43.080
Everybody has to answer because it’s a ‘one
answer’.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:51:09.700
Then I think Steve can come from America.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:24.780
Marie can come from France.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.800
[Olga?]

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:39.870
you come from Switzerland.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:52.850
All right, now nobody is higher or lower.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:52:02.800
You see, they’ll ask questions that have
to be asked.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:09.760
Need not be answered.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:16.960
It cannot be answered?

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.760
One should not worry.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:32.130
But anyone of you can answer the question.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:37.690
Now there are so many intelligent and intellectuals
[laughter] and over-educated people sitting

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:38.720
here.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:45.380
The ones who have to ask the questions are
always better placed than the people who have

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.570
to answer.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.760
All right?

00:52:47.760 --> 00:53:04.370
So, in a way I would like to see how the questions
are asked and what answer is given.

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.980
I would like to see the game.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.290
All right.

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:11.590
Can you ask to get Me something?

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.170
Sahaja Yogi: A cup of tea?

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:33.410
Would one of the ladies get Mother a cup of
tea please?

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:50.410
Shri Mataji: Now, yesterday’s speech was
really good.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:52.530
[Inaudible]

00:53:52.530 --> 00:54:03.160
Yes, come along and sit.

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:26.540
Ah, you must know, there are great intellectuals
sitting here [laughter].

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:35.040
Be careful, all right.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:55:04.790
So, we are very friendly and nice
Who else from which countries are here?

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:06.920
Spain?

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:21.790
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, there’s Robert’s
from Belgium.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:34.550
Shri Mataji: Is he there, Robert?

00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:38.800
Marie: Yes.

00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.920
Robert?

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:55.800
Shri Mataji: Robert, come along, come along.

00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:12.620
I’m so happy to know what you’ve done!

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:29.130
Really remarkable, I must say this.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:37.460
Robert, I really say: what a man!

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:51.800
[Laughter and applause].

00:56:51.800 --> 00:57:19.500
Do you remember how we shot off, you see,
that horrible Rajneesh [Osho]?

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:38.250
From there he came in, how we shot off!

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:42.420
Remember him?

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:54.810
[Inaudible]
I’m very proud of you.

00:57:54.810 --> 00:58:04.640
Robert: Thank you Mother.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:13.280
My ego is going into this.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:20.210
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:28.890
Ego is the same one.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:36.250
That should be the right type of ego.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.310
[laughter].

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:53.910
That type, that ego is a better type where
you question the wrong type of a person.

00:58:53.910 --> 00:59:11.850
But that ego which questions the right type
of person is a stupid ego because it has no

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:15.450
sense, it has no wisdom.

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:45.590
But, you see, for him to come, it’s hell
I tell you, you see, he’s sickening, he’s

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:50.570
very sickening, he sickens people.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.570
How horrid.

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:58.970
Most of the people whom I know who were living
about, say, from the beginning of it must

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:05.990
have ended up in a lunatic asylum, most of
them.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:11.260
Or, [inaudible], another thing I must tell
you.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.660
Those, don there, have been doing this for
years [inaudible],

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:19.050
Robert: I saw pictures of him, recent pictures,
and he wears –

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.570
Sahaja Yogis: Gloves?

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.250
Robert: Yes.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:26.600
He wears now gloves.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.120
Shri Mataji: Why?

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.550
Robert: And big warm gloves.

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.700
I think he is crazy.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.700
[Laughter].

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.510
Robert: And I had vomited from this picture.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:43.730
Shri Mataji: Let him not die because otherwise
he will be more troublesome.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.390
It’s all right.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:49.250
All right, now, please make yourself comfortable.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:01:00.900
Now, most of the people who are real Sahaja
Yogis should ask questions and not those who

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.710
are yet too weeks and formless, all right?

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:16.870
Because they, still I know they, they have
to reach a certain stage of understanding.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:26.820
All right, from Sahaja Yogis only.

01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:33.450
Don’t become thoughtless aware.

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.110
[Laughter].

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:45.970
Sahaja Yogi: You said not mind to mind.

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:49.130
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:53.080
Not mind to mind either.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.560
But let the inspiration come.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.560
[Inaudible]

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:22.020
In India, you’ve led the day to day life
and you have been facing other people in Sahaja

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:24.560
Yoga.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:52.290
You should ask questions about that, what
are the questions they have asked, what was

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:55.910
the problem.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:03:19.900
Now, for this, why do you think you have to
that way?

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:20.900
All right?

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:27.520
Because, you see, now we should sit there
all the time.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:35.900
[Unsure] It would be nice expressions.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.920
[Laughter].

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920
All right?

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:48.030
Three on this side and three on [inaudible]
Let’s have it now.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:53.120
Ah, that’s it, that’s a good idea.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.990
Now, come along.

01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:57.900
Yes, please.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:11.040
Sahaja Yogi: What to say to somebody who comes
up and says very concernedly: ‘what is the

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:28.280
difference between Sahaja Yoga and these-’
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:55.180
Sahaja Yogi: What’s the difference between
what you are doing and what these cults or

01:04:55.180 --> 01:05:03.590
these other gurus are doing?

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:16.370
They all seem saying the same thing, I mean,
they do.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:22.980
Shri Mataji: Say‚ they are using the same
language.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:30.290
Sahaja Yogi: Using the same language.

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:45.070
Shri Mataji: Ah, you see, because in 1970,
I was in America, they have picked up everything.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:48.990
And a gentleman told Me, warned Me.

01:05:48.990 --> 01:06:12.780
He told Me: “Mother, You’d better get
all your tapes ” – or what you call them?

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.420
Sahaja Yogis: Copyrights.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.060
Shri Mataji: Copyrights!

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.480
You see.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.130
I said: “Why?”

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:39.810
He said: “No, this audio words ‘vibrations’
this, that, will used by these people, ‘chakras’

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.210
and all”.

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:47.000
I said: “Very good!”

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:56.240
But ultimately, they have to come to Me for
Realization.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:11.920
But they are using the same, I agree with
you but doesn’t matter.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:17.240
Now, tell him: What’s the difference between
the technique of Sahaja Yoga and the technique

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.100
of these people?

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:27.520
They use the same words.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:39.080
[A Sahaja Yogini refuses]
Let’s have another person, who?

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.370
Warren?

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:53.150
[Laughter]
Warren: All the basic differences, I feel

01:07:53.150 --> 01:08:22.279
Mother is that, in Sahaja Yoga, it’s not
the promise of an experience it’s the actualization.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:35.420
Something actually happens in the presence
of Mataji or other Realized souls.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.290
And you get it.

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:41.929
Another Sahaja Yogi: They also make experiences.

01:08:41.929 --> 01:08:45.060
Shri Mataji: They have their experiences.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.620
Now, let’s see.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:53.989
Marie: One thing that you can explain is whether
they keep the freedom of the individual or

01:08:53.989 --> 01:08:58.310
whether the individual is actually maneuvered.

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:03.040
And you can explain.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:14.630
Shri Mataji: How exactly would you know [unsure]?

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:24.170
Then how [inaudible] by mesmerized or not
by mesmerized?

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:26.960
Marie: Yes, if you are in Sahaja, then you
don’t know.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:48.830
But if you look for and you’re asking, you
can ask the people to see how does it work,

01:09:48.830 --> 01:10:05.260
do you feel that these people are free in
what they are doing?

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:22.810
Do you feel that they doing it out their own
freewill?

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:32.440
Do they look like individuals?

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:48.620
If you go there, are you taught to think for
yourself?

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.620
And is it something where your freedom is
respected.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:11:22.210
Because a lot of the other ones you can explain
that to people is that people are taken in

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:50.160
charge and they are taken in charge morning
till evening and even during the night.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:12:21.920
They never have to learn and they do this,
do that, sing and pray and do whatever and

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920
they never stop.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:31.270
And they’re actually made to fit into a
mould and once they are nicely shaped, they

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:33.900
can’t out of it.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:45.280
Shri Mataji: You mean they don’t understand
what they are doing?

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:52.350
Marie: Eventually, they don’t.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:13:13.120
They’re fitted into something and it’s
some weakness from their left side which make

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:20.730
them want to be led.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:32.280
And it’s something that you still find in
Sahaja Yogis, if you look carefully in yourself,

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.130
we all still got that.

01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:49.560
And we all have to be careful of it.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:14:04.270
Because it’s still there, this tendency
to want to fit into an organisation, be a

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:09.640
“something” [inaudible]
[Shri Mataji is laughing.]

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.520
Marie: And not be who you are.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.230
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:39.030
Marie: And go through with it, go and look
at yourself and go through with it.

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:54.590
And that’s the way it works, people are
told that you, you know, are talking nice

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:59.750
and all this, and all that.

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:02.080
But basically, they are taken in charge.

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.810
And then they don’t think for themselves.

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:19.720
And the language, yes, is correct, but you
have to see the results.

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:39.190
If you want facts, there are plenty of facts,
and these people got files and a [inaudible]

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:47.830
of files [unsure] on what happened to people
going there and if you managed to get them

01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:50.520
out, if ever.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:16:08.660
And that’s were the difference is.

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:44.820
Shri Mataji: It’s very weird, you know,
the Sahaj is not being different, it’s rather

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:53.600
weird I should say.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:17:06.900
All right, let’s see.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:29.110
Now, just see what she has to say.

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:38.150
Let’s see
All right, let’s see what [?] has to say.

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:53.010
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, there are two points
that we usually make.

01:17:53.010 --> 01:18:20.750
One is that you can’t pay for it and then
you don’t pay for it.

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:37.690
And this especially, comes up in America because
there are people who used to pay for absolutely

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:50.840
everything-
Shri Mataji: Anything happens in America.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:19:19.390
Sahaja Yogini: You go to this introduction,
to that introduction, quite always that way.

01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:25.040
It’s not like over here.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.570
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:43.040
Sahaja Yogini: So, that’s something that
attracts a lot of people if they are used

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:50.230
to pay for things, you know, if this is a
sort of wage there.

01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:59.130
And you say: “You cannot pay for it; we
won’t accept things”.

01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:12.000
And in fact, you’ll be some one that [inaudible]
because it’s your own birthday.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.880
Shri Mataji: But that’s the gross.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:24.490
But what happens to the subtle?

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.700
Sahaja Yogini: Subtlety.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:34.100
Shri Mataji: In a subtle way.

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:40.870
Sahaja Yogini: Subtlety the Kundalini is awakened.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:53.550
And the great thing about that is that you
become collectively conscious, which is something

01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:56.330
that can’t be fake.

01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:59.100
You cannot Collective Consciousness.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:10.770
And it’s very simple, you can give an example.

01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:23.570
If you blindfold seven children and you haven’t-
who are Realized- and you haven’t tried

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:32.230
the vibrations in some body, they will all
feel the same thing.

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:33.230
And children don’t fake and everybody has
that.

01:21:33.230 --> 01:21:43.870
If they try the vibrations on somebody else,
they will feel something different.

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:51.550
So, this is an important description to make.

01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:56.690
Shri Mataji: Now let’s have [?] come in.

01:21:56.690 --> 01:22:01.880
She’s covered quite some things, she’s
covered [inaudible].

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:10.510
Sahaja Yogi: Can we imagine important things
about the Sahaja Yogis, not what experience

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:14.120
it gives either, I mean that you get.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:22.340
But what do we have to tell people who ask
for the differences is what the disciples

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:37.310
become, what do they get, and what experiences
connected to other people?

01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:56.530
Because without the capacity to invite in
others [inaudible] any enlightenment at all.

01:22:56.530 --> 01:23:02.420
So, this is the [inaudible].

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:11.180
Shri Mataji: Now, what about him?

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:14.100
Thank you.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:26.960
Marie-Laure: Maybe another point also is that
Sahaja Yoga is the truth.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.190
The truth is eternal.

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:37.630
So, you might be able to relate it to other
scriptures, to know who Christ was, to know

01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:43.590
Mohamed, who Buddha was.

01:23:43.590 --> 01:24:05.850
And nobody can [?] in this group and make
relationship where they are in you, you can

01:24:05.850 --> 01:24:11.560
invite them into you.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:19.739
And not only about the great Prophets but
also with everything, nature, music, science,

01:24:19.739 --> 01:24:20.739
astrology.

01:24:20.739 --> 01:24:21.739
Everything is [inaudible].

01:24:21.739 --> 01:24:31.310
And you can even see this, everything is part
of it.

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:35.010
Shri Mataji: Now Robert, what do you have
to say?

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:38.550
Robert: One can say that in other sects, they
don’t get real powers.

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:44.330
Actually, I experienced that they get powers,
they can put bhoots in you.

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:47.210
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: They get the bhoot’s powers,

01:24:47.210 --> 01:24:48.210
yes?

01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:49.210
Robert: Yes absolutely.

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:50.980
But what can we say?

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.650
Use your common sense.

01:24:52.650 --> 01:25:05.840
Go and see any sect – I don’t know if
it is intelligent to say that.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.770
I experimented a tremendous destroying force.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:42.220
Because when I met Mother, I, first of all,
I got all my stomach, something coming out,

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:47.010
dust, in skin.

01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:56.110
That was a proof that negativity came out.

01:25:56.110 --> 01:26:15.260
That something happens, that really something
happens in me.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:37.690
Actually, I had not such a proof in this sect.

01:26:37.690 --> 01:26:46.350
I only got into their catastrophic thing.

01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:59.960
Shri Mataji: But you’ve not been a long
time with them

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.210
Robert: I was not so long, five months.

01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:11.690
So, I felt also another thing, the fact that
Mother is so elusive for seekers.

01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:18.860
[Shri Mataji bursts into laughter]
Robert: That’s a good thing.

01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:31.510
The fast that Mother is so- doesn’t possess
really.

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:38.320
Because I was so greedy, I remember.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:57.770
The first time I met You, it was the second
program you didn’t look at me.

01:27:57.770 --> 01:28:06.260
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Yes, very clever.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:29.640
All right, now, after all these things, I
would like one of you to answer this question.

01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:44.020
Any one, let’s have, one has to come along.

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:53.610
Let’s have Roxon [unsure], let’s see.

01:28:53.610 --> 01:29:01.600
Come in the audience, yes.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:13.930
Sahaja Yogi: Well, I think the point Gavin
brought up is relevant.

01:29:13.930 --> 01:29:39.300
But what you can tell them is that if you
get a power, if it’s bhoot, all right, it

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:42.420
makes you feel powerful.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:30:00.870
But in Sahaja Yoga, you can actually raise
people’s Kundalini and you van empower them

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:05.910
with the ability to raise Kundalinis.

01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:27.280
For instance, for me, the proof was I stood
behind some new person, I just go and sit

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:34.400
in front of the photograph.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:49.150
I didn’t explain him anything, I stood behind
him and I started moving as Mother is showing

01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:53.750
us and get his heart.

01:30:53.750 --> 01:31:07.890
And things started happening to him and he
begun to feel within him, things happening

01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:15.030
and he felt his Kundalini rising and he began
to feel the joy.

01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:22.120
And I think that is the most important thing,
you can transmit that awakening to other people

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:26.100
and raise their Kundalini rather than just
feeling empowering you.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.310
Something which could be good.

01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:30.060
And I don’t know if bhoots can do that.

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.060
[Laughter]

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.060
Shri Mataji: All right, thank you very much.

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:33.060
Now.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:34.060
You see, always the artificial has to copy
the real.

01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:35.060
It is always so.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:36.630
Artificial has to copy the real, otherwise
you don’t follow.

01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:47.050
Of course, outwardly in the gross we can say
that artificial can sell, but real is spontaneous.

01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:52.930
Or artificial can put up a show, the real
does not.

01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:54.430
The artificial is more eagerness because it
has to sell, while the real is least bothered

01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:55.430
as he said about Me.It’s correct.

01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:56.430
But beyond that, how to make out an artificial
from the real?

01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:57.430
It’s the problem, because they have the
same style of thing and these people say that,

01:31:57.430 --> 01:32:15.000
“We are in the same thing, we are having
vibrations, we have energy, we are raising

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.090
the Kundalini, everything we do”.

01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:18.690
Now the best thing would be to be extremely
practical with this people.

01:32:18.690 --> 01:32:20.890
First of all, you must judge whether they
are seekers or not.

01:32:20.890 --> 01:32:25.190
Then you should see what chakras are catching.

01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:31.500
You see, you move on another line.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:37.730
They move on another line because you are
empowered.

01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:44.180
So, you just see what chakras are catching
on them.

01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:50.800
If you answer them directly, they will come
out with another answer.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:33:23.400
So, when they say something to you, you must
know that if they are bhoots and they are

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.400
possessed then they know your bhoots also.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:37.489
Not only that, but they can read your minds,
that’s one of the powers of bhoots.

01:33:37.489 --> 01:33:47.850
Because they can live on mental level, they
can live on physical level, they can live

01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:53.730
on other levels like- they see whatever past
you have had they can tell you, they can tell

01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:54.730
your future.

01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:55.730
They can [inaudible].

01:33:55.730 --> 01:34:10.060
They can tell you about your future, they
can tell about past, they can tell you about

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:24.890
your mental problems, your brother, father.

01:34:24.890 --> 01:35:04.510
They may even tell you when you have lost
your properties or where you have kept your

01:35:04.510 --> 01:35:20.150
ornaments and who is the thief.

01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:21.150
All these things they can tell you.

01:35:21.150 --> 01:35:22.150
Because their interest is material, so they
know everything about it and they can tell

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:23.150
you.

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:24.150
Now you have facing a person like that.

01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:25.150
So he reads your mind, all right.

01:35:25.150 --> 01:35:36.280
So, when he – you confront such a person,
to deal with a person is to just get quiet.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:44.920
Get into your thoughtless awareness.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:48.370
Be quiet.

01:35:48.370 --> 01:36:05.260
Your fortress is your thoughtless awareness
because your are real.

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:11.910
And try to see his Kundalini, try to raise
it and see where it stops.

01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:12.910
Now, he says, “Why don’t you answer?

01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:13.910
” You say that, “I’m, still let me hear
it, let me get it”.

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:14.910
All right?

01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:22.360
So, show all the patience now, try to raise
his Kundalini first.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:37:07.760
Now if the Kundalini, you see, is absolutely
useless, doesn’t rise, you should say, “All

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:22.110
right, I give up.

01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:25.700
Finished”.

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:32.880
Nothing’s important.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:38:10.140
Our real nature as he said he used, there
is a word for the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’.

01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:15.900
She doesn’t get attached to anyone.

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:16.900
She cannot.

01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:19.890
If She is the energy for the whole universe,
how can She get attached to anyone to any

01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:20.890
personality.

01:38:20.890 --> 01:38:30.239
Only She can nourish and the nourishment can
only go to a person who is willing to take

01:38:30.239 --> 01:38:32.890
the nourishment.

01:38:32.890 --> 01:38:33.890
You are on the giving stage; you are not on
the thinking stage.

01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:38.680
If the other person doesn’t want to have
it, you can’t open the mouth and pour it

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:39.880
in.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:46.580
So, when such a question comes in, you just
go into your meditating mood.

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:52.700
And you will be amazed that the dynamism of
the Spirit will come there at that time.

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.900
Now, maybe it stops at Nabhi.

01:38:54.900 --> 01:39:00.590
Supposing the question at Nabhi stops, the
right Nabhi.

01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:04.900
So, you know, he is a liver patient.

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:06.410
All right?

01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:11.670
You can ask him questions about liver.

01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:14.600
He’ll be amazed that you know that he has
a liver trouble.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:18.200
It stops at right Heart.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.930
You just ask him a question about the right
Heart.

01:39:19.930 --> 01:39:21.440
You just tell him these things, then I’ll
tell you about this.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:22.440
Like, I tell you Douglas.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440
Douglas is not such an intellectual, that
much.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.440
And David Prole [unsure], you see, just saw
My photograph, and he went into contortions

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.440
[Shri Mataji whirl Her hands] and he telephoned
in the ashram and Douglas received it.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.440
And he said, “Who are you?”

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.440
He said, “I’m Douglas, I’m a Sahaja
Yogi”.

01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:28.440
“Really, what this Sahaja Yoga is?”

01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:38.230
He said: “By the way, are you perspiring
too much?”

01:39:38.230 --> 01:39:39.230
He said, “Yes I’m boiling (while) talking
to you”.

01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:40.230
[Laughter]
He said, “That’s it.

01:39:40.230 --> 01:39:41.230
Have you been to TM?”

01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:42.230
He said, “Yes, how do you know?”

01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:43.230
[Laughter]
“I know, because such chakras are catching”.

01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:44.230
He said, “Surprising, these people now would
tell you”.

01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:47.719
He’s only came home and Rustom opened the
book, I think he took My name or I think,

01:39:47.719 --> 01:39:49.380
or he took the name of the Goddess or whatever
it is.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.380
And he just went into contortions again.

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.680
He said, “What have you started?”

01:39:51.680 --> 01:40:06.900
Actually, he got frightened Rustom and he
telephoned to Me: ‘Mother, what’s happening,

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.900
I just got your name”.

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:08.900
So, your powers are divine powers.

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:09.900
Never forget that.

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:13.310
On arguments, then once you have given them
Realization then start the arguments with

01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:14.310
them.

01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:19.640
But you can do it with your attention.

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:32.520
You give them Realization and then the arguments
can be given.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:50.980
Because when I’m discussing with them actually,
I’m raising their Kundalini.

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:52.230
And outwardly I’m discussing you see, everybody
thinks Mother is talking, this, that [inaudible]

01:40:52.230 --> 01:40:53.230
sometimes.

01:40:53.230 --> 01:40:54.230
But I’m really raising their Kundalini inside.

01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:55.230
So, first of all try to raise the Kundalini,
because that works.

01:40:55.230 --> 01:40:56.230
Now, you know for definite what is the difference
between the real and the unreal.

01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:57.230
That unreal is that a myth, that, ‘This
is a snake’, is a myth.

01:40:57.230 --> 01:40:58.230
But when the light comes in you know it is
not.

01:40:58.230 --> 01:40:59.230
Then, the light has come to you.

01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:00.230
Even small children, as they said, they know.

01:41:00.230 --> 01:41:01.230
You have got your own powers, no doubt about
it.

01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:02.230
You can raise your Kundalini, no doubt about
it.

01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:03.230
You can raise others Kundalini, no doubt.

01:41:03.230 --> 01:41:04.230
You can cure people, no doubt.

01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:05.230
For that if I have to give an example, I have
cured even the president of India.

01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:06.230
[43:39] But you may not be certified there
[unsure].

01:41:06.230 --> 01:41:07.230
Then, coming to the mental side of it, how
you have achieved you know, you have given

01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:08.230
up all your habits, then you have become a
better person.

01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:09.230
While people who belong to another country,
they do not give up any habits.

01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:10.230
On the contrary, they become just slaves.

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:11.230
Just slaves!

01:41:11.230 --> 01:41:20.440
They are not independent as he said, they
are not independent.

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:28.070
They become all slaves together and they behave
– collectivity to them is just slavery.

01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:29.380
Apart from that your knowledge is tremendous.

01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.270
You know why you do puja, you know why you
make mantras, you know what mantras to say,

01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:33.700
when to say, how to raise it and the whole
science of it.

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:34.700
Even their gurus, their gurus won’t do,
never do the science that you do.

01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:35.700
All techniques, Nirmala Vidya, you know.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:36.700
So, all the points that they said that you
have your own powers.

01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.700
You can ask them, “Can you feel me?”

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:38.700
“Yes, yes, we are feeling very hot."

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:39.700
That’s all.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:40.700
But you should say, “I’m feeling you.

01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:41.700
You have been to such and such guru."

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700
Then your power to give him Realization.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.700
Also, later on, he can be told and shown how
to give Realization.

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:44.700
You should say, “Now you try to give me
Realization."

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:45.700
You say, “All right, you give me Realization."

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:46.700
“It’s like that?

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.700
All right I will give you.

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.700
Will you allow me?”

01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:49.700
Supposing he accept this.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.700
Finished!

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.700
Then he is finished now.

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:52.700
Once he is Realized then he won’t talk.

01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.000
So, you have to be very understanding of the
situation that first of all, you are a Realized

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.940
soul, you have your own powers, the whole
Divine is behind you.

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.420
Don’t forget it.

01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:05.890
With all confidence, just face the person.

01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:14.300
First go into meditative mood, gather up all
your powers and see that you raise his Kundalini.

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:16.920
Bring him to some point of rapport.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:22.830
Then these points, one by one, as these maybe
you suggested, which they have suggested,

01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:23.830
are done already.

01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:24.830
But before raising them, discussion will lead
to discussion.

01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:33.460
And it’s a headache to be with such people,
I just do it because I don’t get a headache.

01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:35.120
[Laughter].

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:43.430
You people don’t do it.

01:42:43.430 --> 01:43:00.650
I’ve nothing to with the people who cannot
be brought to a certain level of understanding.

01:43:00.650 --> 01:43:03.250
And they themselves will be impressed by your
personality, by your methods.

01:43:03.250 --> 01:43:06.770
In your quiet way, you should say, ‘Ha,
this is…, ha!’ – like that, go on saying,

01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:07.770
‘Yes, yes.’

01:43:07.770 --> 01:44:01.700
So, he thinks that he is impressing you, also
you are listening to him, that also pleases

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.330
them quite a lot.

01:44:04.330 --> 01:44:07.760
Then now, “Thoroughly let me see where is
your Kundalini.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760
Let me see”.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:09.760
See around him.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:10.760
All right.

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.760
Now say what you have to say, again say, “I’m
not to get it”.

01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:12.760
And at the back, raise it.

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:13.760
Because if you cannot take out something straightforward,
means you have to put your finger all around

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.760
him and take it out.

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:15.760
Kundalini, the Kundalini doesn’t want to
rise, we have nothing to do with such horrible

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:16.760
people.

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:17.760
So, first of all, you must judge the other
person, raise his Kundalini, work it out and

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:18.760
then, once he has got it, then do it.

01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:19.760
All right, Lane [unsure]?

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.760
You know the technique.

01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:21.760
Second question.

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.760
So, everyone whatever they have said, connect
first and first raise as he has said it.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.760
Warren is very helpful and all these points
must be brought in.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760
But when we have brought them to a certain
level, just establish them.

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760
Otherwise they’ll be just nodding their
heads or they will be denying you.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.760
It’s totally useless cause definitely you
know your knowledge.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.760
Now, second question.

01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.760
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, You were saying that
people who cannot accept their Realization,

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:29.760
we should not bother with them.

01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:30.760
How do you relate to people around you who
are loving and caring, nice people, but they

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.760
just don’t understand and they don’t accept,
probably they will not?

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:32.760
Shri Mataji: I cannot hear clearly.

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:33.760
Warren: How do you relate to those closely
around you who don’t accept Realization

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:34.760
but who are not negative?

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.760
How do you?

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.760
Another Sahaja Yogi: But who are not negative.

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:37.760
Warren: But who are not negative, but who
just simply don’t understand?

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.760
Marie: Normal people.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.760
[Laughter]

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:40.760
Shri Mataji: They’re not of your level,
you know.

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:41.760
But as a person who is higher than others,
you should be patronizing.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.760
And you should know they are still blind,
they are ignorant, they haven’t got the

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:43.760
knowledge, all right, they will get it.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.760
Keep it like that, position like that.

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.760
That [inaudible]

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.760
There is no need to talk of Sahaja Yoga with
those people, but in your life only, in your

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.760
way of life, they will understand, gradually,
they’ll come.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.760
Maybe they are inadequate, perhaps, maybe,
or maybe they are not seekers or maybe their

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:49.760
time has not yet come.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.760
You cannot force it out.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:51.760
My own daughters are not Realized, I’m not
worried.

01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.760
They know I am something great, no doubt about
it.

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:53.760
And they think they are [ordinary?] people.

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:54.760
Or else, whatever it is, let them be what
they like.

01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.760
It’s all right, I am living a normal life
with them.

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.760
But your own life will convince them that
you’re right.

01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:57.760
And they might start respecting you very much.

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:01.180
And after some time, not only respecting you,
but listening to you and then accepting Sahaja

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:02.180
Yoga.

01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:09.250
There should be no quarrel with them.

01:45:09.250 --> 01:45:23.370
Sahaja Yoga is the most precious thing and
you cannot waste it on anyone.

01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:25.390
You cannot.

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:32.450
Christ has said, “Don’t go yourself…
before ….

01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:40.520
good people” [Inaudible 51:02]; that’s
what it is.

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:50.610
But those people who are around you, who are
they?

01:45:50.610 --> 01:46:03.719
These are your brothers and sisters, these
people are, they speak your language.

01:46:03.719 --> 01:46:18.850
They are there, it’s all right, they will
also get their Realization but they can’t

01:46:18.850 --> 01:46:21.880
speak your language.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:25.910
You may love them.

01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:41.050
Supposing you have a dog in the family–
I’m not saying they are dogs [laughter]–

01:46:41.050 --> 01:46:43.110
but what I mean is just supposing you have
a dog that doesn’t have the human awareness.

01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:44.110
We love the dog the very much, no doubt you
look after the dog, all right but you don’t

01:46:44.110 --> 01:46:45.110
talk with him.

01:46:45.110 --> 01:46:46.110
You don’t expect him to talk like us.

01:46:46.110 --> 01:46:47.110
[laughter]
So, the awareness is at that level.

01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:48.110
On the contrary, we have to be very patronizing
and extremely kind.

01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:49.110
All right?

01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.110
Now can you answer this question and elaborate
it?

01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:51.110
Who will start it now?

01:46:51.110 --> 01:46:52.110
You see, with some people who have had horrible
experiences, will be the people who are around

01:46:52.110 --> 01:46:53.110
Me.

01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:54.110
So, I would request you first of all to speak,
Warren.

01:46:54.110 --> 01:46:55.110
Warren: Well, I think we got one example this
weekend at Robert’s home.

01:46:55.110 --> 01:46:56.110
His parents have gained their Realization.

01:46:56.110 --> 01:46:57.110
Shri Mataji: Really?

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:58.110
Warren: From You.

01:46:58.110 --> 01:46:59.110
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, yes!

01:46:59.110 --> 01:47:00.110
I know.

01:47:00.110 --> 01:47:01.110
Warren: Absolutely sweet people, absolutely
balanced people in the sense in which society

01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:02.110
sees it as a whole, and yet they can’t see
the depth that Robert can see.

01:47:02.110 --> 01:47:03.110
They treated a little patronizingly, like
“there, there, it will be all right.

01:47:03.110 --> 01:47:04.110
You do it your way and we’ll do it our way”.

01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:05.110
Meanwhile they have their cigarettes and they
entertain their guests and they have their

01:47:05.110 --> 01:47:06.110
lifestyle.

01:47:06.110 --> 01:47:07.110
But Robert’s determination was to set the
example, to transform, to let them see by

01:47:07.110 --> 01:47:08.110
his transformation that Sahaja Yoga is it.

01:47:08.110 --> 01:47:09.110
When we were there, they behaved like– they
became disturbed by the tranquillity that

01:47:09.110 --> 01:47:10.110
he was.

01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:11.110
They started rushing around and shouting,
and giving orders and a few things, and slowly

01:47:11.110 --> 01:47:12.110
they could see what is happening and they
started to look at themselves.

01:47:12.110 --> 01:47:13.110
There was a little microcosm of the transformation
actually over that weekend when we were there.

01:47:13.110 --> 01:47:14.110
You can do it by transformation.

01:47:14.110 --> 01:47:15.110
And People start to watch and then instead
of running around in circles getting nowhere,

01:47:15.110 --> 01:47:16.110
they start to say “oh this is something
great”.

01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:17.110
Shri Mataji: Very true.

01:47:17.110 --> 01:47:18.110
What would you say Christine?

01:47:18.110 --> 01:47:19.110
It’s a difficult question for you.

01:47:19.110 --> 01:47:20.110
Christine: Well there’s certainly no point
in arguing about it or trying to discuss Sahaja

01:47:20.110 --> 01:47:21.110
Yoga beyond telling, if anybody asks, you
can say how much good it’s done to you,

01:47:21.110 --> 01:47:22.110
how much you’re transformed.

01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:23.110
You can say many things if people are interested.

01:47:23.110 --> 01:47:24.110
And if they are not, you can, you just live
with them, you just be yourself.

01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:25.110
You enjoy yourself and they will see you enjoying
yourself much more than they’re enjoying

01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:26.110
themselves.

01:47:26.110 --> 01:47:27.110
And, “Hmm, what’s going on here?”

01:47:27.110 --> 01:47:28.110
Then they might become a little bit curious.

01:47:28.110 --> 01:47:29.110
But if they don’t, it doesn’t matter either.

01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:30.110
And really, unless somebody is seeking, unless
they’re asking for it, then all we can do

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:31.110
is be there.

01:47:31.110 --> 01:47:32.110
You know, just go about our business, just
do what has to be done and be perfectly normal.

01:47:32.110 --> 01:47:33.110
Shri Mataji: And I’ll go a little further.

01:47:33.110 --> 01:47:34.110
If you try to take interest in anyone like
that, you’ll have very bad experiences.

01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:35.110
Christine: Oh, yes.

01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:36.110
Shri Mataji: Never good.

01:47:36.110 --> 01:47:37.110
Okay?

01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:38.110
Warren: Yes.

01:47:38.110 --> 01:47:39.110
Christine: Yes, never even try because then
you’ll really get caught up.

01:47:39.110 --> 01:47:40.110
Shri Mataji: All right, now we’ll have another
question.

01:47:40.110 --> 01:47:41.110
Sahaja Yogi: Mother?

01:47:41.110 --> 01:47:42.110
Shri Mataji: Yes, please?

01:47:42.110 --> 01:47:43.110
Sahaja Yogi: I have a question now, besides
all the questions.

01:47:43.110 --> 01:47:44.110
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear you.

01:47:44.110 --> 01:47:45.110
Sahaja Yogi: My sister and myself and Christopher,
her husband, went to see my parents the other

01:47:45.110 --> 01:47:46.110
week and they had a whole experience there.

01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:47.110
They just went absolutely crazy, you know.

01:47:47.110 --> 01:47:48.110
I was wondering what would you do in that
situation because when you can’t even get

01:47:48.110 --> 01:47:49.110
a word in, all you can do it sit there [laughter],
what would you do in that situation?

01:47:49.110 --> 01:47:50.110
Because I don’t know.

01:47:50.110 --> 01:47:51.110
Now they’re just entangling themselves you
know.

01:47:51.110 --> 01:47:52.110
Shri Mataji: That’s it.

01:47:52.110 --> 01:47:53.110
That’s it.

01:47:53.110 --> 01:47:54.110
Pat can tell you.

01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:55.110
Pat?

01:47:55.110 --> 01:47:56.110
Come along.

01:47:56.110 --> 01:47:57.110
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible]

01:47:57.110 --> 01:47:58.110
Pat: Well I got quite a lot of problems with
my parents.

01:47:58.110 --> 01:47:59.110
To begin with, we were working to convert
them, you know [inaudible] and we just- in

01:47:59.110 --> 01:48:00.110
our first puja, we just got carried away and
we said, “too much, too soon”.

01:48:00.110 --> 01:48:01.110
You know, we just-in fact, it nearly worked
because we were so enthusiastic.

01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:02.110
My father got Realization, he gave up drinking
and he started saying the Catholic church

01:48:02.110 --> 01:48:03.110
has never really satisfied him and all this;
And my mother panicked.

01:48:03.110 --> 01:48:04.110
[Inaudible] and then he gave up and went back
to drinking and she’s very happy.

01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:05.110
[Laughter] But we still haven’t given up
hope but the problem was that we were [inaudible]

01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:06.110
together too involved, I think.

01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:07.110
But you can get upset with it because you
are so closed to them and in the end, I was

01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:08.110
getting very, very upset because my father-
I mean the situation I have with my son is

01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:09.110
[inaudible] my parents.

01:48:09.110 --> 01:48:10.110
And my father hearing bad news taking this
from Kevin [unsure] and I was getting really

01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:11.110
upset because I had tried to be nice with
him all the time.

01:48:11.110 --> 01:48:12.110
And inside, I was getting furious.

01:48:12.110 --> 01:48:13.110
But, in the end, one day I was so upset because
he’s been beating Kevin thinking this would

01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:14.110
be his right.

01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:15.110
And my mother said, look this is ridiculous,
“Just go and teach him a lesson.

01:48:15.110 --> 01:48:16.110
Go and get rid of his drink”.

01:48:16.110 --> 01:48:17.110
So, I went home and got hold [inaudible] and
they were horrified.

01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:18.110
But it made the brake, you know.

01:48:18.110 --> 01:48:19.110
Afterwards my father said, “You quite respect
me for what I have done, [inaudible]”.

01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:20.110
But since them, I have been more detached.

01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:21.110
[Laughter]

01:48:21.110 --> 01:48:22.110
Shri Mataji: [Inaudible] First, if you had
asked him this about four years back, he was

01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:23.110
very serious and he used to feel it too much,
saying, “My father”, every time he used

01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:24.110
to say, “Mother see, my father drinks.

01:48:24.110 --> 01:48:25.110
My mother is like that”.

01:48:25.110 --> 01:48:26.110
In the morning he was so upset, he would come
out with such an expression, you see, absolutely

01:48:26.110 --> 01:48:27.110
disgusting.

01:48:27.110 --> 01:48:28.110
But now, you see, they are taking it very
easily, I mean, it’s a joke for them, now

01:48:28.110 --> 01:48:29.110
it’s nothing so disgusting or, I mean sort
of comparing.

01:48:29.110 --> 01:48:30.110
And they would think that their Realization
is useless because the father is drinking,

01:48:30.110 --> 01:48:31.110
the mother- you see, your relationship is
with God.

01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:32.110
And those who are related to God are your
relations- real.

01:48:32.110 --> 01:48:33.110
Others are just by the way, they are there,
all right, but then they started enjoying

01:48:33.110 --> 01:48:34.110
them, they never were so upset as they were
before.

01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:35.110
This is what happens as you start growing.

01:48:35.110 --> 01:48:36.110
Warren: There’s also a very subtle ego sometimes
about because-

01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:37.110
Shri Mataji: You think they have.

01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:38.110
Warren: If we can’t change them.

01:48:38.110 --> 01:48:39.110
Shri Mataji: That’s true, it’s true, it’s
true, it’s true.

01:48:39.110 --> 01:48:40.110
Warren: We get a bit upset and that translates
into a sort of caring attitude which is of

01:48:40.110 --> 01:48:41.110
course is very false.

01:48:41.110 --> 01:48:42.110
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s true.

01:48:42.110 --> 01:48:43.110
Shri Mataji: Yes
Sahaja Yogi; The thing is Mother, if we have

01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:44.110
been spoken to our friends and told them about
Sahaja Yoga, yet they immediately condemn

01:48:44.110 --> 01:48:45.110
you.

01:48:45.110 --> 01:48:46.110
But every time you walk through the door,
they scream at you and shout at you and you

01:48:46.110 --> 01:48:47.110
are trying to love them.

01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:48.110
And whatever you’re doing, I mean I’m
not trying to indoor in Sahaja Yoga or anything.

01:48:48.110 --> 01:48:49.110
It’s just they scream for no reason.

01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:50.110
Another Sahaja Yogi: Weaknesses.

01:48:50.110 --> 01:48:51.110
Marie: Also, what’s wrong with them?

01:48:51.110 --> 01:48:52.110
[Laughter]
You shouldn’t share this [inaudible] than

01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:53.110
the stomach.

01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:54.110
Shri Mataji: No, but you see, it is also sometimes
when there are bhoots, they react like that.

01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:55.110
It is so.

01:48:55.110 --> 01:48:56.110
John will tell you, there was a fellow who
is running a – your friend, John, was running

01:48:56.110 --> 01:48:57.110
that, a big store or something.

01:48:57.110 --> 01:48:58.110
We went with him in the car and he was a Raktabija
disciple.

01:48:58.110 --> 01:48:59.110
You remember, you went amuck?

01:48:59.110 --> 01:49:00.110
John: Yes, Mother.

01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:01.110
Shri Mataji: And poor John, you know, he wanted
to jump out of the car [Shri Mataji is laughing]

01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:02.110
because he just went amuck in his presence.

01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:03.110
Just went amuck.

01:49:03.110 --> 01:49:04.110
So, now, what is the next question?

01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:05.110
Sahaja Yogi: I have a question Mother.

01:49:05.110 --> 01:49:06.110
Even during [inaudible] … She’s has been
quite interested and a friend of mine is quite

01:49:06.110 --> 01:49:07.110
interested in seeing You.

01:49:07.110 --> 01:49:08.110
So, it happens that I have an effect on people.

01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:09.110
But sometimes it ends up very sincere seekers,
another, my mother’s friend, I gave her

01:49:09.110 --> 01:49:10.110
your picture, she’s very sincere.

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.110
Sometimes I’m not sure exactly how to talk
about it, how to initiate, how to bring it

01:49:11.110 --> 01:49:12.110
up, and I know that all these people are really
seeking, they are not low-quality people.

01:49:12.110 --> 01:49:13.110
Sometimes I feel instead of watering it, I’m
forcing it down their throats.

01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:14.110
I would like to come to the centre….

01:49:14.110 --> 01:49:15.110
Shri Mataji: It’s a good idea.

01:49:15.110 --> 01:49:16.110
Sahaja Yogi: My parents for instance, although
they profess to be against it, they’ve been

01:49:16.110 --> 01:49:17.110
very sweet, they help me to come here, they
had an attraction towards it, despite what

01:49:17.110 --> 01:49:18.110
they’ve been helping me.

01:49:18.110 --> 01:49:19.110
I guess because they see the work, the change.

01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:20.110
Shri Mataji: Well, you should not be involved.

01:49:20.110 --> 01:49:21.110
The point is, you see, whatever is desired
is good, but you should not get involved in

01:49:21.110 --> 01:49:22.110
their desires.

01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:23.110
Their desire is a good idea because you should
work it out, after all, you are [inaudible]

01:49:23.110 --> 01:49:24.110
the most.

01:49:24.110 --> 01:49:25.110
It will work our also but if you think that
you can get involved into it, either you’ll

01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:26.110
play into ego or superego.

01:49:26.110 --> 01:49:27.110
You should not get involved with people who
are not themselves seeking.

01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:28.110
That’s the point.

01:49:28.110 --> 01:49:29.110
What else?

01:49:29.110 --> 01:49:30.110
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, one question which always
comes up, it’s about You, Mother.

01:49:30.110 --> 01:49:31.110
[Inaudible] what are you expecting in this?

01:49:31.110 --> 01:49:32.110
Who is this Mataji?

01:49:32.110 --> 01:49:33.110
Who is that expert?

01:49:33.110 --> 01:49:34.110
It’s always difficult to know-
Shri Mataji: No, but do not talk about Me

01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:35.110
for the time being.

01:49:35.110 --> 01:49:36.110
You see, even if you talk about Me or not
makes no difference to Me, anything.

01:49:36.110 --> 01:49:37.110
Let them come, gradually themselves they will
know.

01:49:37.110 --> 01:49:38.110
You should say, “There must be someone,
that’s all.

01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:39.110
Now, you’d better guess”, you leave it
to them.

01:49:39.110 --> 01:49:40.110
You need not say anything to them.

01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:41.110
That’s one thing I warn, always from the
very beginning, it’s too much to bear for

01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:42.110
people, you see?

01:49:42.110 --> 01:49:43.110
You should say, “There must be something
about Her, we don’t know”.

01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:44.110
But it is too much- because, you see, if you
tell them that I am such and such, either

01:49:44.110 --> 01:49:45.110
they’ll be finished out of fear or they’ll
be on top of this, you see.

01:49:45.110 --> 01:49:46.110
So, the best thing is not to tell; these things
are not to be told.

01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:47.110
That’s why I’ve told you that in this
lifetime I’ve decided not to talk about

01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:48.110
it to anyone till they are Realized souls
very settled.

01:49:48.110 --> 01:49:49.110
Even in that book, you have written that Sahasrara
is ‘Jai Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi’.

01:49:49.110 --> 01:49:50.110
Please do not write.

01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:51.110
You should write there ‘Adi Shakti’, that’s
better.

01:49:51.110 --> 01:49:52.110
Because after all, I know that one should
not worry about all these things, because

01:49:52.110 --> 01:49:53.110
this I’m telling the Deities, you see.

01:49:53.110 --> 01:49:54.110
And that one should tell it, and I must say
what is the truth is, and all that and I should

01:49:54.110 --> 01:49:55.110
not waste time and I understand that.

01:49:55.110 --> 01:49:56.110
But why I am saying this?

01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:57.110
That these people are very delicately placed,
they’re ignorant and just because of this,

01:49:57.110 --> 01:49:58.110
if there are going to be chattered [unsure]
it’s better not to tell them.

01:49:58.110 --> 01:49:59.110
So, for puja also we don’t have all of them
there.

01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:00.110
Very few people should be around to come to
puja.

01:50:00.110 --> 01:50:01.110
All half-baked people should be really kept
away.

01:50:01.110 --> 01:50:02.110
They should not be told what I am, nothing
of the kind.

01:50:02.110 --> 01:50:03.110
In Gregoire’s book, that’s the mistake
he committed, I think, because he put Rajneesh

01:50:03.110 --> 01:50:04.110
there and said that I had said so and so.

01:50:04.110 --> 01:50:05.110
And I couldn’t take it
There’s no need to say.

01:50:05.110 --> 01:50:06.110
By saying that, what do you achieve?

01:50:06.110 --> 01:50:07.110
Or what do I achieve?

01:50:07.110 --> 01:50:08.110
Whatever I am, I am.

01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:09.110
Warren: But Mother, You’ve achieved a lot
that night, you said in a very scowling nature

01:50:09.110 --> 01:50:10.110
that question, “You’ve got to recognize
Me”.

01:50:10.110 --> 01:50:11.110
And that achieved a tremendous-
Shri Mataji: When did I say that?

01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:12.110
Warren: At Hampstead.

01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:13.110
Sahaja Yogi: At Caxton Hall.

01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:14.110
Sahaja Yogi: At Caxton Hall, sorry, I beg
your pardon, yes.

01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:15.110
And that blasted them up.

01:50:15.110 --> 01:50:16.110
Shri Mataji: But you see, I made the timings
of it.

01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:17.110
At the right time I say.

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:18.110
Warren: Of course.

01:50:18.110 --> 01:50:19.110
Shri Mataji: But you had made mistake that
time.

01:50:19.110 --> 01:50:20.110
So, I would say, better avoid saying about
Me.

01:50:20.110 --> 01:50:21.110
Warren: You said it anyway, Mother, it was
not that [inaudible]

01:50:21.110 --> 01:50:22.110
Shri Mataji: But you see, it must have been
the first time I said it that way.

01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:23.110
But you see, most of them were Sahaja Yogis,
there were very few people who first had come,

01:50:23.110 --> 01:50:24.110
new people, then I had to say that.

01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:25.110
But, normally, you should not say though it’s
true, very true.

01:50:25.110 --> 01:50:26.110
This is the only condition you have.

01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:27.110
If you cannot recognize Me, nothing can work
out.

01:50:27.110 --> 01:50:28.110
This is the only condition you have.

01:50:28.110 --> 01:50:29.110
If you cannot recognize Me, nothing can work
out.

01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:30.110
It’s perfectly right, I agree, I accept,
it’s a fact, that’s what they have put

01:50:30.110 --> 01:50:31.110
it up.

01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:32.110
That has to be.

01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:33.110
Now, I’ll tell you, say, this lady who was
there, Peggy, and my foot, you see, was like

01:50:33.110 --> 01:50:34.110
this.

01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:35.110
It was so painful; I could not put it on the
ground.

01:50:35.110 --> 01:50:36.110
Both put especially this one [right foot].

01:50:36.110 --> 01:50:37.110
They asked Me, “I said, I don’t know what’s
happening with Peggy and all, this foot won’t

01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:38.110
allow Me to stand”.

01:50:38.110 --> 01:50:39.110
This could not!

01:50:39.110 --> 01:50:40.110
All the Deities were angry with Me.

01:50:40.110 --> 01:50:41.110
And they were just going down and down emitting
such vibrations, tremendous vibrations.

01:50:41.110 --> 01:50:42.110
I didn’t ask, I mean, to take vibrations
[unsure], we soothe them, soothe them, soothe

01:50:42.110 --> 01:50:43.110
them.

01:50:43.110 --> 01:50:44.110
See, they don’t listen.

01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:45.110
She told Me that, “Mother, I just put your
photograph in this village”.

01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:46.110
And the whole place was flooded by the river.

01:50:46.110 --> 01:50:47.110
And the river washed all our bedrooms, bathrooms,
everything.

01:50:47.110 --> 01:50:48.110
[Laughter] Three inches much, the water came
in, it washed all of us.

01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:49.110
The people who were doing fraud or something
were caught up and all kinds of things happened.

01:50:49.110 --> 01:50:50.110
In that, in those three weeks only, she said
there was a real [inaudible].

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:51.110
[Laughter] She told Me this.

01:50:51.110 --> 01:50:52.110
But this you need not tell others, you see,
because they won’t understand these things.

01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:53.110
So, no use telling them, you see, those who
do not understand what is the purpose of telling

01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:54.110
them and wasting your energy.

01:50:54.110 --> 01:50:55.110
It’s unnecessary.

01:50:55.110 --> 01:50:56.110
It’s unnecessary, I tell you, it has no
meaning, believe Me.

01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:57.110
Sahaja Yogi: A general point, Mother, when
people first get Realization they are full

01:50:57.110 --> 01:50:58.110
of enthusiasm but they can only express itself
through the old channels.

01:50:58.110 --> 01:50:59.110
So, they want to talk about You and they want
those who are close to them to come to Sahaja

01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:00.110
Yoga, to accept them in a new place, a new
style, but they don’t have the capacity

01:51:00.110 --> 01:51:01.110
to achieve this using the vibrations.

01:51:01.110 --> 01:51:02.110
Because that capacity has to develop.

01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:03.110
This is why so many of us had trouble at first
of integrating our new experience in our own

01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:04.110
life without staying in our old life style
as well.

01:51:04.110 --> 01:51:05.110
When people get these urges to rush out and
convert everybody, they have the question

01:51:05.110 --> 01:51:06.110
whereas it’s coming from within themselves.

01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:07.110
But there is a way of been subtle.

01:51:07.110 --> 01:51:08.110
Shri Mataji: Doing that also you should be
generous with them.

01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:09.110
Because in this country, I told you ego is
in front of the nose, you see, like that,

01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:10.110
you have to be very generous.

01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:11.110
Sahaja Yogi: It’s only when we know You
that we understand how many forms that You

01:51:11.110 --> 01:51:12.110
can take Mother.

01:51:12.110 --> 01:51:13.110
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Shri Mataji: That’s you, not everyone.

01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:14.110
Sahaja Yogi: Then we have to ask You to [inaudible]
and it works.

01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:15.110
Shri Mataji: No, I know you have asked many
people, I know that you ask them to ask Mother,

01:51:15.110 --> 01:51:16.110
“if you are so, if you are so, if you are
so “.

01:51:16.110 --> 01:51:17.110
All right.

01:51:17.110 --> 01:51:18.110
But you have certainly a sense of temperance
about it [unsure].

01:51:18.110 --> 01:51:19.110
That all of us should have.

01:51:19.110 --> 01:51:20.110
Of course, I mean sometimes we have to do
it because especially in India where they

01:51:20.110 --> 01:51:21.110
worship all these Shivas, this and this, then
you have to ask them that, “Are you this

01:51:21.110 --> 01:51:22.110
Shiva?”.

01:51:22.110 --> 01:51:23.110
But there the religions accept and I ask-
because they know that Shakti is higher than

01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:24.110
anything else.

01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:25.110
But they don’t mind.

01:51:25.110 --> 01:51:26.110
But here, a woman herself is very low and
then all the Gods and Goddesses are much above,

01:51:26.110 --> 01:51:27.110
so, who is she?

01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:28.110
So here, because the ego is just in front
of the nose, like that you see, it’s better

01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:29.110
to be careful.

01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:30.110
That’s what I am saying.

01:51:30.110 --> 01:51:31.110
But sometimes you have to say.

01:51:31.110 --> 01:51:32.110
But I am rather worried because apart from
that, you may lose them even you may lose

01:51:32.110 --> 01:51:33.110
your tooth, it may happen for saying like
that, you see?

01:51:33.110 --> 01:51:34.110
People are extremely violent and their violence
may not be so much physical but mentally they

01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:35.110
are very violent people.

01:51:35.110 --> 01:51:36.110
And they say all kinds of things which you
may not be able to bear.

01:51:36.110 --> 01:51:37.110
Sahaja Yogi: What I am saying Mother, you
have to ask Shri Hanumana and Shri Bhairava

01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:38.110
to do the job.

01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:39.110
Those who are trying to think, “I can do
it by myself”.

01:51:39.110 --> 01:51:40.110
Shri Mataji: You yourself are saying, all
right.

01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:41.110
But you need not tell the other person.

01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:42.110
Sahaja Yogi: You don’t tell the other person.

01:51:42.110 --> 01:51:43.110
But you ask the Deities to handle such a situation
so they get sort it out.

01:51:43.110 --> 01:51:44.110
Shri Mataji: They manage the show.

01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:45.110
But they can sometimes manage the show, you
see they are all there.

01:51:45.110 --> 01:51:46.110
Well, in the case of Peggy, you should see
Gavin’s face.

01:51:46.110 --> 01:51:47.110
[Laughter]
How could he manage so well, [unsure] you

01:51:47.110 --> 01:51:48.110
see, she was so stupid you can’t imagine!

01:51:48.110 --> 01:51:49.110
That she just started talking like that.

01:51:49.110 --> 01:51:50.110
But it’s all managed, I agree.

01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:51.110
But sometimes, they also manage it so well.

01:51:51.110 --> 01:51:52.110
And then you feel, “Baba, don’t manage
it, let us give it”.

01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:53.110
On the whole, on the whole, we must know that
our job is to save with patience, with understanding,

01:51:53.110 --> 01:51:54.110
whether we convince them mentally or not is
not the point.

01:51:54.110 --> 01:51:55.110
How many people we save, is the point.

01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:56.110
This is absolutely the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:57.110
How many people on the earth we save?

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:58.110
That’s the only thing that we have to look
after.

01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:59.110
Whether mentally you satisfy somebody or not,
whether- that’s not important, you see?

01:51:59.110 --> 01:52:00.110
How many people you are going to save, that’s
all.

01:52:00.110 --> 01:52:01.110
Whether they are Indians, Americans, Australians,
makes no difference.

01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.110
These identifications are also there, you
see, that English must save English, you see,

01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:03.110
when they drown each other very much.

01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:04.110
But still, it is so! Australians must save
Australians.

01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:05.110
[Inaudible] as Maria said, it’s true.

01:52:05.110 --> 01:52:06.110
French!

01:52:06.110 --> 01:52:07.110
But it is not the way to do, what we have
to do, how many human beings we are going

01:52:07.110 --> 01:52:08.110
to save?

01:52:08.110 --> 01:52:09.110
And don’t get after anyone who is difficult,
forget him!

01:52:09.110 --> 01:52:10.110
We have to get more people so if you run after
one person you definitely waste your energy

01:52:10.110 --> 01:52:11.110
on one person.

01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:12.110
Instead of that, why not get to ten good people
and work it out?

01:52:12.110 --> 01:52:13.110
All right?

01:52:13.110 --> 01:52:14.110
Now, what about you, have you any question,
Bran?

01:52:14.110 --> 01:52:15.110
Bran: Earlier, Mother, you were talking about
not wasting energy on people who have been

01:52:15.110 --> 01:52:16.110
on Sahaja Yoga for some time but who are half-baked.

01:52:16.110 --> 01:52:17.110
What is the criteria?

01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:18.110
How are judgements made?

01:52:18.110 --> 01:52:19.110
How does one or a group of people decide that
an individual should be left or not, encourage

01:52:19.110 --> 01:52:20.110
that [unsure]
Shri Mataji: No, there’s no need to have

01:52:20.110 --> 01:52:21.110
a group of people.

01:52:21.110 --> 01:52:22.110
Look at them, you see, the way they start
talking.

01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:23.110
When they talk you feel somebody is talking
through their head.

01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:24.110
You can make out.

01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:25.110
Well, you can make out with your head, it
can be [unsure] You see, they start talking

01:52:25.110 --> 01:52:26.110
like that.

01:52:26.110 --> 01:52:27.110
Their style of talking, they criticize Sahaja
Yogis, they criticize Sahaja Yoga, this is

01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:28.110
the style of a negative personality.

01:52:28.110 --> 01:52:29.110
They say all these things, you see, then you
will know they are the ones.

01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:30.110
Their style of talking you can make out, the
way they live.

01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:31.110
Like this Peggy went to India, in Puna, and
got after someone.

01:52:31.110 --> 01:52:32.110
And then she was crawling as he says, in the
hall just like a snake, you see.

01:52:32.110 --> 01:52:33.110
And people asked her, “What do you do?”
and she said, “I’m giving exercise to

01:52:33.110 --> 01:52:34.110
my Kundalini”.

01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:35.110
[Laughter]

01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:36.110
But now you know, this stupid woman.

01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:37.110
You don’t have to show off in Sahaja Yoga.

01:52:37.110 --> 01:52:38.110
Quarrelling people, all these are negative
people, to quarrel, for Sahaja Yogis, it’s

01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:39.110
too much.

01:52:39.110 --> 01:52:40.110
All this is negative.

01:52:40.110 --> 01:52:41.110
Insulting people, these are all negative people.

01:52:41.110 --> 01:52:42.110
It’s not difficult to make out, you can
see.

01:52:42.110 --> 01:52:43.110
Among hundred people, they would be only one
or two like that, at the most, at the most.

01:52:43.110 --> 01:52:44.110
Say, in the whole of England we found only
Peggy like that.

01:52:44.110 --> 01:52:45.110
[Inaudible]
[Shri Mataji is laughing]

01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:46.110
Yes, yes.

01:52:46.110 --> 01:52:47.110
Sahaja Yogi; Mother what should we say if
people would say that Sahaja Yogis are self-righteous

01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:48.110
because we only seem to care about very few
people.

01:52:48.110 --> 01:52:49.110
Shri Mataji: Let them say.

01:52:49.110 --> 01:52:50.110
You see, their certificate is not going to
match [unsure] with God.

01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:51.110
We are righteous people; we are righteous
for God and we are going to save others who

01:52:51.110 --> 01:52:52.110
want to become righteous.

01:52:52.110 --> 01:52:53.110
No doubt about it.

01:52:53.110 --> 01:52:54.110
Why should we worry, you see, for the certificate
of the people?

01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:55.110
We are not politicians; we are not seeking
votes.

01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:56.110
We have to do the desire of God.

01:52:56.110 --> 01:52:57.110
We have to work for what God wants us to do.

01:52:57.110 --> 01:52:58.110
In that case, you see, you have to- of course
with dignity, with compassion, with love,

01:52:58.110 --> 01:52:59.110
with affection it will be done, no doubt about
it.

01:52:59.110 --> 01:53:00.110
But all these qualities for what?

01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:01.110
For saving people.

01:53:01.110 --> 01:53:02.110
If, by all these qualities, you cannot save
someone, better forget it.

01:53:02.110 --> 01:53:03.110
Whether they call you righteous or not, it
not doesn’t matter.

01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:04.110
Their certificate is of no use to us.

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:05.110
Their certificate is like the certificate
of the Pope, you see, when you are going to

01:53:05.110 --> 01:53:06.110
have any new certificate.

01:53:06.110 --> 01:53:07.110
Who cares, you see?

01:53:07.110 --> 01:53:08.110
God does not care for people who are not Sahaja
Yogis.

01:53:08.110 --> 01:53:09.110
He doesn’t care for these people because
they are the [inaudible].

01:53:09.110 --> 01:53:10.110
That’s not important but that doesn’t
mean that we should be arrogant, we should

01:53:10.110 --> 01:53:11.110
be unkind.

01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:12.110
With some people, you have to.

01:53:12.110 --> 01:53:13.110
Marie: Mother, there is a point there that
the question has been asked to me before.

01:53:13.110 --> 01:53:14.110
About specific people saying, But there are
people in Sahaja Yoga who are dogmatic and

01:53:14.110 --> 01:53:15.110
use Sahaja Yoga as something to clean on [unsure]”
And those people being quite obvious so something

01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:16.110
had to be said.

01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:17.110
I could not say, “it’s not true” because
it’s quite obvious.

01:53:17.110 --> 01:53:18.110
Shri Mataji: No, I don’t think so.

01:53:18.110 --> 01:53:19.110
Marie: So, all you have to say or all I could
find to say in such cases is that Sahaja Yogis

01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:20.110
are on their way to, they are progressing,
but you can’t expect us to be perfect.

01:53:20.110 --> 01:53:21.110
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, why did you judge
Sahaja Yogis?

01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:22.110
What I am saying, why should you give them
so much importance?

01:53:22.110 --> 01:53:23.110
Who are they to judge Sahaja Yogis?

01:53:23.110 --> 01:53:24.110
They are not our own.

01:53:24.110 --> 01:53:25.110
You should not allow anybody to criticize
them.

01:53:25.110 --> 01:53:26.110
That’s one thing and a principle of Sahaja
Yoga.

01:53:26.110 --> 01:53:27.110
I know there are some little less, little
more, all right.

01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:28.110
But nobody outside us can criticize Sahaja
Yogis in the presence of Sahaja Yogis.

01:53:28.110 --> 01:53:29.110
Nothing.

01:53:29.110 --> 01:53:30.110
They are Realized souls.

01:53:30.110 --> 01:53:31.110
They are of our level.

01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:32.110
Those people who are not of our level cannot
criticize.

01:53:32.110 --> 01:53:33.110
And we should never accept any criticism from
anyone about any Sahaja Yogi.

01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:34.110
Among ourselves, you can discuss.

01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:35.110
Not for someone outside, after all they are
not Realized souls.

01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:36.110
You see, you must know you are a Realized
soul, you are saints!

01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:37.110
You understand?

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:38.110
A saint has to respect the saint.

01:53:38.110 --> 01:53:39.110
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis are like that,
who respect other people.

01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:40.110
[A name] for example, he used to respect other
people more than the Sahaja Yogis.

01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:41.110
It’s a very common thing about him.

01:53:41.110 --> 01:53:42.110
And Chaya [?] was so surprised at him.

01:53:42.110 --> 01:53:43.110
She said, “How he respects others!

01:53:43.110 --> 01:53:44.110
Oh, he’s such a big man”.

01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:45.110
But he died of [inaudible].

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:46.110
She couldn’t understand, she couldn’t
explain.

01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:47.110
You are all saints and how can saints be judged
by other people who are not saints?

01:53:47.110 --> 01:53:48.110
They have no business.

01:53:48.110 --> 01:53:49.110
You tell them, Rishap [unsure; inaudible]
So, I never allowed that because you are Realized

01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:50.110
souls after all, you must know you are Realized
souls and that your capacity is very different

01:53:50.110 --> 01:53:51.110
of the capacity of these people, mondain people
who go on criticizing, “He’s like this,

01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:52.110
he’s like that”.

01:53:52.110 --> 01:53:53.110
How can you understand?

01:53:53.110 --> 01:53:54.110
How can you understand from that level?

01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:55.110
You should go and see saint Gagangad Maharaj,
[Gagangiri or Gajanan].

01:53:55.110 --> 01:53:56.110
You might say he is a very hot temper fellow,
he’s like this, he’s like that, and he

01:53:56.110 --> 01:53:57.110
can be very cruel.

01:53:57.110 --> 01:53:58.110
You can say about him but when you see his
vibrations you know he is not.

01:53:58.110 --> 01:53:59.110
When I’d go to see him, they told Me that,
“Mother, you never go and see any guru,

01:53:59.110 --> 01:54:00.110
why do you want to see him?”

01:54:00.110 --> 01:54:01.110
I said, “All right, now you don’t discuss
with Me, just put your hands towards this."

01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:02.110
And we had to climb about seven miles up and
the vibrations started to come.

01:54:02.110 --> 01:54:03.110
I said, “Now, that’s it."

01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:04.110
Whether he has a proper body or not, whether
he has proper cloth or not, whether he lives

01:54:04.110 --> 01:54:05.110
in a palace or on the street makes no difference
to a Sahaja Yogi.

01:54:05.110 --> 01:54:06.110
If he is a Sahaja Yogi, he is a Sahaja Yogi,
he’s my brother, he’s my sister.

01:54:06.110 --> 01:54:07.110
This is the thing which was – in everyone
must happen [unsure], you see?

01:54:07.110 --> 01:54:08.110
And this misidentification also leads to trouble.

01:54:08.110 --> 01:54:09.110
And, you see, in the outside people who are
not Sahaja Yogis, make a point, I have seen

01:54:09.110 --> 01:54:10.110
people- I know, because I have a double life,
I know how people create an impression: “Oh,

01:54:10.110 --> 01:54:11.110
please come in, please sit down, I would not
disturb…”

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:12.110
[Laughter]
That’s all, it is nothing deeper than that!

01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:13.110
Those who are deep people must realize the
value of other deep people, because they are

01:54:13.110 --> 01:54:14.110
the only ones who understand you and you understand
them.

01:54:14.110 --> 01:54:15.110
This is one of the reasons why there are rifts
among Sahaja Yogis.

01:54:15.110 --> 01:54:16.110
They don’t respect each other.

01:54:16.110 --> 01:54:17.110
Once somebody is a Realized soul, he is to
be respected as a saint, no doubt about it.

01:54:17.110 --> 01:54:18.110
I respect them as saints.

01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:19.110
If I have to judge relatively from [inaudible]-
say for example, they’ll be sitting here,

01:54:19.110 --> 01:54:20.110
I ‘ll be sitting there perhaps, maybe outside.

01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:21.110
[Laughter]
But you are saints, you see, and saints have

01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:22.110
to be respected, you are saints.

01:54:22.110 --> 01:54:23.110
The whole world respects, every flower, every
leaf, every wave of the ocean respect a saint.

01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:24.110
You must assume yourself as saints.

01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:25.110
Saints are saints, after all, it doesn’t
matter [inaudible] here and there.

01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:26.110
Yes, what is it?

01:54:26.110 --> 01:54:27.110
Sahaja Yogi: Also, the situation in the ashram,
Mother?

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:28.110
If we have people living there who frankly
just don’t get in together.

01:54:28.110 --> 01:54:29.110
And who don’t improve themselves [inaudible]
what can we do with him?

01:54:29.110 --> 01:54:30.110
Should the ashram play a sort of role [inaudible]?

01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:31.110
Shri Mataji: No, it’s not a convenience,
well, I must say it’s not a convenience.

01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:32.110
Ashram is a place for disciplining yourself,
for perfecting yourself.

01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:33.110
As I said that your relation to yourself should
be of perfection, cause this is what you have

01:54:33.110 --> 01:54:34.110
to offer to God.

01:54:34.110 --> 01:54:35.110
And ashram is a place where you have to perfect
yourself.

01:54:35.110 --> 01:54:36.110
If there are people like that, you should
ask them to get out.

01:54:36.110 --> 01:54:37.110
Ashram is not a place where it should happen-
ashram, you should ask Me [unsure], it’s

01:54:37.110 --> 01:54:38.110
not a place of convenience.

01:54:38.110 --> 01:54:39.110
If you have to live there, you have to live
with the rules and regulations whatever the

01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:40.110
ashram has brought so far.

01:54:40.110 --> 01:54:41.110
I’ve seen all of them.

01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:42.110
And those who do not want to do it should
get out of it.

01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:43.110
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you Mother.

01:54:43.110 --> 01:54:44.110
Ashram is not a place of any convenience.

01:54:44.110 --> 01:54:45.110
Many people say, “It’s very cheap here,
ashram”, come along, from everywhere now

01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:46.110
they want to come down and settle an ashram.

01:54:46.110 --> 01:54:47.110
That’s not so.

01:54:47.110 --> 01:54:48.110
Ashram is cheap but it’s very difficult.

01:54:48.110 --> 01:54:49.110
Those who want to perfect themselves have
to come to ashram.

01:54:49.110 --> 01:54:50.110
Those who do not want should not come.

01:54:50.110 --> 01:54:51.110
If they are so comfortable otherwise, it’s
all right, don’t make others have problems

01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:52.110
about it, it’s a simple as that.

01:54:52.110 --> 01:54:53.110
In addition to that, one must know the person
who is made in charge, he may be not up to

01:54:53.110 --> 01:54:54.110
the mark, whatever it is, but through him
I can act.

01:54:54.110 --> 01:54:55.110
I cannot act through all of you.

01:54:55.110 --> 01:54:56.110
So, you should not challenge the authority
of the person who is appointed.

01:54:56.110 --> 01:54:57.110
If I thank you, it’s just like through him
[unsure].

01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:58.110
But you don’t start like every time, like
“Matter load us”,

01:54:58.110 --> 01:54:59.110
[Laughter]
Disciplining is the point there, perfecting

01:54:59.110 --> 01:55:00.110
yourself.

01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:01.110
You see, this is the first thing I told you,
your attitude should be towards yourself [inaudible].

01:55:01.110 --> 01:55:02.110
Relationship should be ideal like a Sahaja
Yogi is a Sahaja Yogi.

01:55:02.110 --> 01:55:03.110
Worship your relationship with Sahaja Yogis.

01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:04.110
It’s who can kill [unsure] your own!

01:55:04.110 --> 01:55:05.110
How can you bear any malice against him?

01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:06.110
Sahaja Yoga: We should be self-disciplined,
Mother.

01:55:06.110 --> 01:55:07.110
Shri Mataji: Hem?

01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:08.110
Sahaja Yogi: We should be self-disciplined
ourselves.

01:55:08.110 --> 01:55:09.110
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

01:55:09.110 --> 01:55:10.110
Sahaja Yoga: It shouldn’t be an imposed
discipline within the ashram, it should be,

01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:11.110
each and individual should be self-disciplined.

01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:12.110
Shri Mataji: If that is the case coming there.

01:55:12.110 --> 01:55:13.110
But if we leave it to that, I tell you: no
[?]

01:55:13.110 --> 01:55:14.110
[Laughter]
First, it used to be forced.

01:55:14.110 --> 01:55:15.110
Warren: What we found in Australia, Mother,
it perhaps, maybe not be an example that can

01:55:15.110 --> 01:55:16.110
be translated into Britain, but we found that
by being strict first, then the strictness

01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:17.110
recedes and they become themselves disciplined.

01:55:17.110 --> 01:55:18.110
Shri Mataji: There’s a very nice sloka in
Sanskrit which I’ll say to you:

01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:19.110
“Pancha varshani tadayet
dasha varshani partet

01:55:19.110 --> 01:55:20.110
shodashe varshe prapte tu
putram mitravad acharet”.

01:55:20.110 --> 01:55:21.110
[Lalayet pancha varshani dasha varshani tadayet
prapte tu shodashe varshe putre mithravad

01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:22.110
acharet]

01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:23.110
For five years of age, you beat the child,
“tadayet”, chisel him out, that is “dasha”;

01:55:23.110 --> 01:55:24.110
“dasha varshani prapte tu partet” [unsure],
then educate up, till ten years of age.

01:55:24.110 --> 01:55:25.110
“Shodashe varshe prapte tu”, when the
child becomes sixteen years of age, treat

01:55:25.110 --> 01:55:26.110
him like a friend.

01:55:26.110 --> 01:55:27.110
Now, only eight years have passed in this
country and there are many whom I am treating

01:55:27.110 --> 01:55:28.110
just like a friend.

01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:29.110
I’ve never a problem with many.

01:55:29.110 --> 01:55:30.110
And all of you should be like that.

01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:31.110
But in the beginning, you do need discipline,
no doubt.

01:55:31.110 --> 01:55:32.110
That’s the only way you can drive out your
bhoots I think.

01:55:32.110 --> 01:55:33.110
It has to be forced.

01:55:33.110 --> 01:55:34.110
Of course, the time will come when it won’t
be forced, you see.

01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:35.110
As I would say, first communism then democracy.

01:55:35.110 --> 01:55:36.110
[Laughter]
Otherwise, we’ll have no man.

01:55:36.110 --> 01:55:37.110
If you give democracy, people won’t know
how to use freedom.

01:55:37.110 --> 01:55:38.110
So, that’s important.

01:55:38.110 --> 01:55:39.110
Yes, please?

01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:40.110
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, how shall we bring up
the children who are born to us, Sahaja Yogis?

01:55:40.110 --> 01:55:41.110
Shri Mataji, aside to Warren: What?

01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:42.110
Sahaja Yogi: For example, should we get them
up to meditate in the morning and force them

01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:43.110
to do it?

01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.110
Or shall we just let them?

01:55:44.110 --> 01:55:45.110
Shri Mataji, aside to Warren: What does he
say?

01:55:45.110 --> 01:55:46.110
Warren: In regard with the practices within
Sahaja Yoga, what should we as parents do

01:55:46.110 --> 01:55:47.110
for our children who are born of Sahaja Yogi?

01:55:47.110 --> 01:55:48.110
In practical way.

01:55:48.110 --> 01:55:49.110
Shri Mataji: They are born as Realized souls.

01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:50.110
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

01:55:50.110 --> 01:55:51.110
Shri Mataji: You see, those are born as Realized
souls, they have their awareness no doubt,

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.110
so they should be taught how to respect Sahaja
Yoga, how to respect your Mother, how to dedicate.

01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:53.110
But you should not spoil them because if they
are Realized souls, they may try to get away

01:55:53.110 --> 01:55:54.110
with things which they should not allow.

01:55:54.110 --> 01:55:55.110
In the beginning, a Sahaja Yogi child has
to be very, very disciplined, it’s very

01:55:55.110 --> 01:55:56.110
important.

01:55:56.110 --> 01:55:57.110
It’s more important for a Sahaja Yogi child
than for an ordinary child.

01:55:57.110 --> 01:55:58.110
Because he has powers.

01:55:58.110 --> 01:55:59.110
That’s how Ravana became Ravana.

01:55:59.110 --> 01:56:00.110
He was a Realized soul but he was not trained
to be a Realized soul and he became Ravana.

01:56:00.110 --> 01:56:01.110
Because he was feeling as a sole [unsure]
human being.

01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:02.110
So, you must train them up, you must discipline
them in a way that is Sahaja Yogi’s style.

01:56:02.110 --> 01:56:03.110
It’s very important it’s a very big responsibility.

01:56:03.110 --> 01:56:04.110
But, respect them.

01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:05.110
And thirdly, I would say that always tell
children what they are: “You are Sahaja

01:56:05.110 --> 01:56:06.110
Yogis.

01:56:06.110 --> 01:56:07.110
You have come on this earth for [inaudible]
what?

01:56:07.110 --> 01:56:08.110
You can’t behave as other children; you
are the citizens of God’s kingdom.

01:56:08.110 --> 01:56:09.110
You are his children”.

01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:10.110
Remind them, put them up the ideas before
them.

01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:11.110
“How can you behave?

01:56:11.110 --> 01:56:12.110
You are Sahaja Yogis”.

01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:13.110
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, shall we also, for example,
meditation in the morning, shall we insist

01:56:13.110 --> 01:56:14.110
that they do it?

01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:15.110
Shri Mataji: Insist on?

01:56:15.110 --> 01:56:16.110
Sahaja Yogi: That they do meditation in the
morning?

01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:17.110
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

01:56:17.110 --> 01:56:18.110
If you start doing it, they’ll do with you.

01:56:18.110 --> 01:56:19.110
But very important, like I’ve seen children
in the West are very ego-oriented, even if

01:56:19.110 --> 01:56:20.110
they are Realized souls, children.

01:56:20.110 --> 01:56:21.110
You must have – I was telling Gavin- that
you must give them a balance, put them “left

01:56:21.110 --> 01:56:22.110
to the right”.

01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:23.110
This country builds, you see, all these Western
countries build this, what you call ego.

01:56:23.110 --> 01:56:24.110
So, best thing is to give them a balance so
that they don’t develop their egos.

01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:25.110
You can work everything on them.

01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:26.110
Very important there, they are [inaudible]
they are beautiful things, beautiful lamps,

01:56:26.110 --> 01:56:27.110
but you have to look after them that no dirt
should fall on them.

01:56:27.110 --> 01:56:28.110
They should not become dirty again because
I have to cleanse them again and again, what’s

01:56:28.110 --> 01:56:29.110
the use?

01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:30.110
Discipline is very important, they lack it.

01:56:30.110 --> 01:56:31.110
Like we, my grand-daughters, I’ve seen,
because my discipline is rather subtler, but

01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:32.110
doesn’t matter.

01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:33.110
Even their own mother, they would not go out
without telling Me.

01:56:33.110 --> 01:56:34.110
Anywhere, even if they have to go to the Moon,
that is now what they’ll say: “Tell the

01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:35.110
mother, tell the mother, I’m going up”.

01:56:35.110 --> 01:56:36.110
Of course, it’s family, tradition and all
that.

01:56:36.110 --> 01:56:37.110
And there are many people who come from families
where there is no tradition like that.

01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:38.110
I find they behave in a very artificial manner.

01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:39.110
They might be born Realized, and what’s
the use?

01:56:39.110 --> 01:56:40.110
And as Sahaja Yogis, it is your duty that
your parents think that you’re starting

01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:41.110
a new dynasty now and these are real children
and they have to be trained as people of a

01:56:41.110 --> 01:56:42.110
new dynasty.

01:56:42.110 --> 01:56:43.110
It doesn’t look nice for Realized souls
to behave like very ordinary mundane type

01:56:43.110 --> 01:56:44.110
of people.

01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:45.110
There should be a certain dignity, there should
be certain understanding and the quarrelling

01:56:45.110 --> 01:56:46.110
and all this selfishness, this you must tell
[unsure] it’s forbidden.

01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:47.110
Materialism, materialistic attitude, every
time you can imagine you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:56:47.110 --> 01:56:48.110
Put their attention more to the vibration
side, more to the Realization side, asking

01:56:48.110 --> 01:56:49.110
them what is catching, where, they’ll change.

01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:50.110
You have to talk to- you have to talk to them.

01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:51.110
More [inaudible] about moral things, you have
to talk to them.

01:56:51.110 --> 01:56:52.110
Your own behaviour should guide them [unsure].

01:56:52.110 --> 01:56:53.110
But also, you have to talk to them and tell
them that, “This is not good”.

01:56:53.110 --> 01:56:54.110
As it is, being Realized, they are very happy
but I’d say, Kevin was a Realized soul.

01:56:54.110 --> 01:56:55.110
But, in between, he was influenced by his
grand-mother and there was a problem with

01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:56.110
him.

01:56:56.110 --> 01:56:57.110
But the, he came out, isn’t it, Pat?

01:56:57.110 --> 01:56:58.110
Pat: Yes, Mother.

01:56:58.110 --> 01:56:59.110
He improved tremendously when he started disciplining
him.

01:56:59.110 --> 01:57:00.110
Shri Mataji: Hum?

01:57:00.110 --> 01:57:01.110
Pat: When he started coming every time to
meditate with us in the morning.

01:57:01.110 --> 01:57:02.110
He improved a lot.

01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:03.110
Shri Mataji: You have to tell.

01:57:03.110 --> 01:57:04.110
Pat: There are people that we were living
and to see [unsure] a for a couple of [inaudible]

01:57:04.110 --> 01:57:05.110
it didn’t work at all.

01:57:05.110 --> 01:57:06.110
Shri Mataji: That’s only here that they
do like this, I think, this avoiding this

01:57:06.110 --> 01:57:07.110
responsibility.

01:57:07.110 --> 01:57:08.110
In childhood, you must tell children what
you want to see, what you want to do.

01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:09.110
They must be trained because, you see, after
all, who is going to guide them?

01:57:09.110 --> 01:57:10.110
Guidance is very important, it’s not conditioning.

01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:11.110
I must say our children have very good nature
[in India] whether they are Realized or not,

01:57:11.110 --> 01:57:12.110
aren’t they?

01:57:12.110 --> 01:57:13.110
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:14.110
Shri Mataji: You tell them, “Sit”, they’ll
sit.

01:57:14.110 --> 01:57:15.110
And here, very ego-oriented.

01:57:15.110 --> 01:57:16.110
You can see the children how they’re going
to [inaudible].

01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:17.110
Warren: And there the children have such a
natural poise, a natural respect.

01:57:17.110 --> 01:57:18.110
Shri Mataji: Absolutely.

01:57:18.110 --> 01:57:19.110
We all feel [inaudible], you see?

01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:20.110
You tell them, “Sit down” and they’ll
sit.

01:57:20.110 --> 01:57:21.110
If you tell them, “I want this”, they’ll
go and fetch it.

01:57:21.110 --> 01:57:22.110
You see now, just now, she brought the flowers
[inaudible] touch my feet and now gone, finished.

01:57:22.110 --> 01:57:23.110
But out upbringing never ends you see.

01:57:23.110 --> 01:57:24.110
Even they’re grown up, you tell people,
“This is not good, this should not be done”,

01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:25.110
and nobody feels bad about it, [inaudible]
will feel we are parents and want to have

01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:26.110
parents!

01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:27.110
[Unsure]
But here the parents also have gone amuck,

01:57:27.110 --> 01:57:28.110
I must say.

01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:29.110
Because of this “no more limit”.

01:57:29.110 --> 01:57:30.110
Like Pat’s father used to drink and the
mother said, “What’s wrong in drinking?”

01:57:30.110 --> 01:57:31.110
Like once, Sadhana asked Me that the- [Laughter]
[Two young girls come to give flowers and

01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:32.110
a kiss to Shri Mataji.

01:57:32.110 --> 01:57:33.110
They do namaskar]
Good, “tike”.

01:57:33.110 --> 01:57:34.110
The parents are familiar that’s why, make
confusion.

01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:35.110
And that’s how you people, don’t understand
that we have moral values, moral values that

01:57:35.110 --> 01:57:36.110
our parents had [inaudible].

01:57:36.110 --> 01:57:37.110
So, the moral and all that is [inaudible].

01:57:37.110 --> 01:57:38.110
But let’s here re-establish a new dynasty
as I said.

01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:38.610
[Shri Mataji smiles]
