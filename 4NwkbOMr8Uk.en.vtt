00:03.750 --> 00:13.590
It was very nice to come to Reading again,
and to meet very nice people like your Mayor

00:13.590 --> 00:21.180
and another nice person who was interviewing
me at the radio station.

00:21.180 --> 00:32.070
I am discovering new talents in this place
which is really historically very important.

00:32.070 --> 00:41.130
But in the history of spirituality, England
as a whole has to play a very, very important

00:41.130 --> 00:44.540
role, which perhaps English people don’t
realise.

00:44.540 --> 00:50.770
William Blake has said that, that England
has to become Jerusalem.

00:50.770 --> 00:56.739
It has to become a Holy land and you all have
to become holy people.

00:56.739 --> 01:00.780
He is not a liar, he wouldn’t tell you a
lie.

01:00.780 --> 01:07.170
People can say that he was a visionary and
he visualised things beyond his foresight.

01:07.170 --> 01:16.280
That’s not a fact, because about Sahaja
Yoga he has written very vividly, clearly,

01:16.280 --> 01:24.790
as to where I’ll be staying since my arrival
in England, where our ashram is going to be.

01:24.790 --> 01:34.790
It is so beautifully done that I feel this
land has something special about it to produce,

01:34.790 --> 01:40.850
or to create, such great poets, such great
seers.

01:40.850 --> 01:45.040
India of course is a country of yoga, no doubt.

01:45.040 --> 01:54.320
But there also we had a great poet, about
the same time as Blake, maybe a little earlier,

01:54.320 --> 01:55.320
Gyaneshwara.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.630
He did write about Kundalini.

01:56.630 --> 02:05.320
He also described the times of Sahaja Yoga
by saying that: at that time, the people who

02:05.320 --> 02:13.960
are in darkness, the people who are blind,
will see light.

02:13.960 --> 02:22.080
He’s also gone further to say that: those
people who will receive light, will be able

02:22.080 --> 02:26.069
to enlighten other people.

02:26.069 --> 02:34.300
But William Blake has very clearly said that
men of God will become prophets, and these

02:34.300 --> 02:39.510
prophets will have powers to make others prophets.

02:39.510 --> 02:49.250
And this is the test that you should put to
everything: “Have I become a prophet?”

02:49.250 --> 02:54.720
I mean, it’s all right there are many people
who are around, who are selling their things.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.260
I don’t know what they are doing to attract
more people.

02:58.260 --> 03:09.200
Like the mayor asked me that, “As your work
is so fantastic, you must have been receiving

03:09.200 --> 03:11.069
thousands of people!”

03:11.069 --> 03:14.200
I said, “No I don’t.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.690
Sometimes I receive five or sometimes ten!”

03:16.690 --> 03:17.739
He was amazed!

03:17.739 --> 03:19.629
He said, “How can that be?”

03:19.629 --> 03:21.050
I said, “It’s true!

03:21.050 --> 03:23.880
I receive very few people to come to my programme.

03:23.880 --> 03:29.250
And if they come and stick on for a while,
they get Realisation all right.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.450
But there are very few who come.

03:30.450 --> 03:32.010
He was quite amazed.

03:32.010 --> 03:33.180
He said, “Really?

03:33.180 --> 03:37.849
But I am surprised, you don’t charge any
money, there’s no membership.

03:37.849 --> 03:41.629
I mean it really shows that it is something
Divine.

03:41.629 --> 03:44.790
And still, how is it few people come to you?”

03:44.790 --> 03:49.120
I said, “I will ask the same question to
you, because I don’t understand human beings!

03:49.120 --> 03:56.540
You better answer me that why so few people
come and take advantage of this Sahaja Yoga

03:56.540 --> 04:04.830
which gives you the power that is lying within
you, which gives you what you have already

04:04.830 --> 04:10.189
existing within you, which is your own, it’s
your own property.

04:10.189 --> 04:13.680
Still they don’t come, even if you tell
them [that] freely you are going to be given

04:13.680 --> 04:18.390
all your bank balances, please come, please
come, but they don’t come."

04:18.390 --> 04:23.780
So I said, “Instead of asking me this question,
for the first time, let me ask you this question.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.000
I can’t understand."

04:25.000 --> 04:31.449
But in Indian villages it’s a different
thing: where the people come in thousands.

04:31.449 --> 04:35.760
One of the reasons may be that the people
do not know much about Kundalini, they are

04:35.760 --> 04:37.120
naïve about that.

04:37.120 --> 04:44.550
And they do not know what it means by the
word ‘Self-Realisation’: what it means,

04:44.550 --> 04:47.330
what is a Self, and what should happen to
us.

04:47.330 --> 04:54.680
Perhaps that may be the reason: a sort of
ignorance about it.

04:54.680 --> 05:01.330
But despite all that, this word ‘Self-Realisation’
has been used since long by many marketeers,

05:01.330 --> 05:03.770
and nobody has been able to give it.

05:03.770 --> 05:09.259
Now if somebody says, “Yes it can happen
to you, just it can happen."

05:09.259 --> 05:11.450
I think there should be real interest.

05:11.450 --> 05:21.310
But still I cannot explain why is it that
few people come, and those who come also do

05:21.310 --> 05:23.640
not stick on, they have no patience.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.570
“But with other gurus?”

05:25.570 --> 05:27.010
He asked me.

05:27.010 --> 05:32.320
I said, “No, there are many [that] go: thousands
and thousands."

05:32.320 --> 05:39.100
There’s one fellow whom the British people
have given 58 Rolls Royces, and then they

05:39.100 --> 05:44.130
gave him a 59th one because he would not come
without getting a Rolls Royce from them.

05:44.130 --> 05:49.240
So they starved themselves for one year, and
gave him the 59th Rolls Royce!

05:49.240 --> 05:52.160
And how many people must have done it?

05:52.160 --> 05:57.940
Fifty-thousand people collected that money
to give it to this fellow to come down here!

05:57.940 --> 06:01.330
Already now that he has 59th, I think he must
be waiting for the 60th.

06:01.330 --> 06:07.590
And I wouldn’t be surprised that they will
be again collecting money for him.

06:07.590 --> 06:11.449
One must understand that you cannot pay for
God.

06:11.449 --> 06:15.440
You cannot buy God by giving him a Rolls Royce.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.550
He doesn’t understand this Rolls Royce,
He doesn’t understand money, He doesn’t

06:19.550 --> 06:20.550
understand bank.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.840
He doesn’t know the mint.

06:21.840 --> 06:28.930
He doesn’t know that you are having a new
system, of this paper money.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.630
He’s not aware of these things.

06:31.630 --> 06:38.050
But somehow we are so much used to these mundane
things, regular things, that we personally,

06:38.050 --> 06:43.840
all of us, feel that if it is going to be
God, He has to be just like us: there should

06:43.840 --> 06:48.180
be an organisation, there should be a chairman,
there should be a vice-chairman, there has

06:48.180 --> 06:52.300
to be a secretary, and all this organisation
must be there.

06:52.300 --> 06:56.530
And there only if we go, then it’s all right,
then we are safe, we are secure, because we

06:56.530 --> 06:59.090
are used to it.

06:59.090 --> 07:05.630
But God’s laws and God’s domain is very
different from what we understand.

07:05.630 --> 07:08.270
We have never felt his love.

07:08.270 --> 07:14.380
We have been always working, with all our
organised things because we were insecure

07:14.380 --> 07:15.440
about something.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.240
Every institution is for some kind of an insecurity.

07:19.240 --> 07:25.520
Because we are insecure, we think something
is going to fall upon us, something horrible

07:25.520 --> 07:29.830
is going to happen, that’s how we form a
thing.

07:29.830 --> 07:35.680
Otherwise our children may be spoiled or our
old people may die, or something may happen,

07:35.680 --> 07:37.360
we form an organisation.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.569
This is not believing in God.

07:40.569 --> 07:45.270
Secondly we form, also, organisations because
we hate.

07:45.270 --> 07:52.720
But we have never seen the Power of Love,
which is the most beautiful, blissful and

07:52.720 --> 07:58.009
smoothly working: like a flower becoming a
fruit.

07:58.009 --> 08:00.460
Have you ever seen a flower becoming a fruit?

08:00.460 --> 08:01.840
Nobody has seen it.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.270
How slowly it becomes!

08:05.270 --> 08:09.099
Have you ever seen a bud opening into a flower?

08:09.099 --> 08:13.919
You have to put a slow motion camera to catch
that slow movement.

08:13.919 --> 08:20.460
All that is done by this great Power of God,
this Divine Power which is called as ‘Brahma’

08:20.460 --> 08:22.480
in Sanskrit language.

08:22.480 --> 08:29.750
And to know that Brahma is the idea behind
Self-Realisation.

08:29.750 --> 08:35.740
It is all-pervading, It is working everywhere,
but we cannot feel It and we have to feel

08:35.740 --> 08:36.740
That.

08:36.740 --> 08:38.050
And how to feel it?

08:38.050 --> 08:39.490
How to know that?

08:39.490 --> 08:45.830
The only way is to get yourself connected
with your Self which connects you to that

08:45.830 --> 08:48.821
All-pervading Power, and it starts flowing
through you.

08:48.821 --> 08:55.970
If you learn the ways and methods you can
manoeuvre it, you can use it and you can give

08:55.970 --> 08:57.170
it to others also.

08:57.170 --> 09:02.240
It’s a very simple thing like putting a
connection.

09:02.240 --> 09:07.750
Like you come in the room: if you have to
put on the lights, you just have to switch

09:07.750 --> 09:09.000
on, it’s like that.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.840
It’s very simple.

09:10.840 --> 09:16.000
But when you switch on the light, you must
know that there’s a very huge organisation

09:16.000 --> 09:18.930
behind this little switch.

09:18.930 --> 09:23.260
In the same way, behind all this there’s
a very great organisation of God Almighty,

09:23.260 --> 09:28.500
which we have not known: we have just heard
about God, “There is God, and let’s pray

09:28.500 --> 09:29.600
to God,” All that.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.000
But where is He?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
What is He?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.450
And what are we?

09:33.450 --> 09:34.709
We have never known that.

09:34.709 --> 09:41.230
So first time you get connected with His Power.

09:41.230 --> 09:47.940
Now about Spirit: I mean, in English language
‘spirit’ is used for so many things!

09:47.940 --> 09:52.260
They will use it for a dead body – it’s
a spirit.

09:52.260 --> 09:54.920
They’ll use it for also spirits: alcohols.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.060
‘Spirit’ for Atma.

09:56.060 --> 10:02.000
But where I am talking now it is about the
Atma: the Spirit, which is the reflection

10:02.000 --> 10:10.670
of God Almighty within us, which is the witness,
which watches every moment, every action of

10:10.670 --> 10:11.670
ours.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.180
And it stays there till it enjoys.

10:13.180 --> 10:22.149
To understand the Spirit, we have to know
its nature, what is the nature of the Spirit

10:22.149 --> 10:28.080
is, and then, when we get enlightenment, what
happens to us.

10:28.080 --> 10:31.710
Now here you have seen three powers, as they
have shown you.

10:31.710 --> 10:36.350
The first power is on the right hand side,
is the power of action.

10:36.350 --> 10:42.760
I mean the first one is the power of desire
which is on the left hand side, the second

10:42.760 --> 10:48.940
one is the power of action, and in the centre
is the power of, what we call, the sustenance

10:48.940 --> 10:50.730
which gives you our evolution.

10:50.730 --> 10:54.200
So we have three powers.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.980
All these three powers act within us.

10:56.980 --> 10:59.170
For example the first power of desire.

10:59.170 --> 11:09.420
The first power of desire within us acts in
such a manner that we start desiring for things.

11:09.420 --> 11:15.740
Actually the whole universe is created [and]
out of the universe, this beautiful thing

11:15.740 --> 11:18.440
like human being is created.

11:18.440 --> 11:28.170
And this power that has created this special
thing called ‘human being’ is the residual

11:28.170 --> 11:39.240
power that resides in the triangular bone,
for the ultimate desire to be one with the

11:39.240 --> 11:41.149
Divine.

11:41.149 --> 11:44.832
But it has not yet manifested, so that is
why it is called as a residual power.

11:44.832 --> 11:50.790
It has not yet manifested because we have
not yet become one with the Divine.

11:50.790 --> 11:55.530
So that power is still sleeping within us,
that’s why they call it a sleeping Kundalini.

11:55.530 --> 12:01.870
But that desire is within us, and that drives
us to all kinds of seeking: we make mistakes,

12:01.870 --> 12:08.360
we do all kinds of wrong choices — doesn’t
matter — everything can be forgiven.

12:08.360 --> 12:16.980
But she resides in the triangular bone waiting
for a chance when she could be awakened by

12:16.980 --> 12:19.240
somebody who has the authority to awaken.

12:19.240 --> 12:24.320
As he told you just now that it’s an actualisation,
you cannot just go to a church, and somebody

12:24.320 --> 12:27.490
puts the hand on your head and he says, “All
right, I have baptised you."

12:27.490 --> 12:29.860
This is only just a false certificate, you
know that.

12:29.860 --> 12:31.519
It’s a false certificate.

12:31.519 --> 12:39.610
But when this power is manifested, when you
become one with the Divine, when yoga, the

12:39.610 --> 12:46.640
union, takes place, then only we can say that
Kundalini has manifested itself: means your

12:46.640 --> 12:50.610
desire to be one with the Divine has been
manifested.

12:50.610 --> 12:57.990
So now there are four powers I have told you
about: one is the power of desire with which

12:57.990 --> 13:01.720
we desire other things.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.990
Like we may desire to have a chair.

13:04.990 --> 13:11.870
So what we do, if there is some steel which
is dead, we make another dead stuff like called

13:11.870 --> 13:13.910
a ‘chair’, which is of steel — another
dead.

13:13.910 --> 13:20.350
We sit on it [and] we start become habituated
with this: means a part of us is deadened,

13:20.350 --> 13:24.190
because we can’t sit without a chair, the
chair sits on our head.

13:24.190 --> 13:27.900
People carry chairs with them, because they
just can’t sit without the chairs.

13:27.900 --> 13:32.700
Like that the matter starts fighting your
Spirit, and starts giving you habits.

13:32.700 --> 13:37.050
The another thing of matter is that it never
gives you joy.

13:37.050 --> 13:42.700
For example, you want to have a table, all
right, then you want to have a chair, then

13:42.700 --> 13:46.470
you want to have a car, then you want to have
a helicopter, and never happy!

13:46.470 --> 13:53.130
So, wants in general are never satiable; is
a principle of economics.

13:53.130 --> 13:54.130
Why?

13:54.130 --> 13:57.320
Because matter cannot give you satisfaction,
that’s why.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.310
It just plays with you.

13:59.310 --> 14:04.040
You like one thing, you jump to it, you like
another thing, you jump to another one.

14:04.040 --> 14:11.170
Now this matter within us is created by the
right side, that is the power that comes to

14:11.170 --> 14:13.920
us from five elements.

14:13.920 --> 14:21.089
And these five elements, when they are not
enlightened do not give joy.

14:21.089 --> 14:25.660
They are within us, we use them.

14:25.660 --> 14:30.149
Supposing somebody thinks that, “If I go
to race and if I win a big amount of money

14:30.149 --> 14:31.149
I’ll be happy."

14:31.149 --> 14:35.310
But you go and see the person after six months,
you will find that he’s the most unhappy

14:35.310 --> 14:36.430
person ever known.

14:36.430 --> 14:39.490
Because money is a headache, house is a headache.

14:39.490 --> 14:41.010
Anything that you own is a headache.

14:41.010 --> 14:45.390
It is better that others should own it and
you should enjoy; that’s a better way of

14:45.390 --> 14:46.390
looking at things.

14:46.390 --> 14:53.170
But we think that possession is something
that we can really enjoy, which is not true,

14:53.170 --> 14:56.130
because we are not going to take anything
with us.

14:56.130 --> 15:03.820
Now when these five elements act upon us,
what happens to us?

15:03.820 --> 15:04.980
What do we develop?

15:04.980 --> 15:08.190
We develop, in the subtle way, the attention.

15:08.190 --> 15:13.010
Say there is something, a matter, here, my
attention can be drawn to it.

15:13.010 --> 15:17.790
If there is something material, my attention
can be drawn to it.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.920
But supposing something is in the ether, I
cannot see it.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.390
Something that is not material I cannot see
it.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.340
So the attention cannot be drawn.

15:25.340 --> 15:31.130
That’s how our attention is created by these
five elements, within ourselves.

15:31.130 --> 15:37.660
Now this attention that we have: naturally
because it is created by the material things,

15:37.660 --> 15:45.000
in the sense that it is created by the causal
of these elements, our attention goes to material

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
things.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
It’s natural, because it is created by that,
isn’t it?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Our attention is outside.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.490
If I say, “Put your attention inside!”

15:50.490 --> 15:51.709
How can you?

15:51.709 --> 15:57.889
I mean there’s no way of putting it inside:
it’s an impossible situation.

15:57.889 --> 16:01.470
Because anything that happens outside, our
attention goes there.

16:01.470 --> 16:06.990
Something material, something substantial
we see, and then our attention goes to that.

16:06.990 --> 16:10.149
But how can you put your attention inside,
because we are lost, we do not know where

16:10.149 --> 16:13.600
to go, how to find it, how to put our attention
inside.

16:13.600 --> 16:20.980
So this attention is within us, and when the
Kundalini rises, then the attention is drawn

16:20.980 --> 16:22.800
in, because of the happening.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.850
That’s why a happening is necessary.

16:24.850 --> 16:30.079
Supposing suddenly you are listening to me,
and something falls down, your attention will

16:30.079 --> 16:31.079
go to it.

16:31.079 --> 16:35.830
That is why a happening takes place, that
this Kundalini rises and she attracts the

16:35.830 --> 16:36.830
attention inside.

16:36.830 --> 16:42.920
But actually when she touches the Spirit,
what happens to the attention itself?

16:42.920 --> 16:45.779
The attention becomes enlightened.

16:45.779 --> 16:48.600
Now what is that?

16:48.600 --> 16:51.310
Attention becomes enlightened, means what?

16:51.310 --> 16:55.300
Means that this attention has a light.

16:55.300 --> 17:01.290
Now supposing you have an attention which
has a light, what should happen?

17:01.290 --> 17:04.750
That you look at anyone, you should be able
to know that person in and out.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.730
That should be the first thing, isn’t it?

17:06.730 --> 17:10.789
If your attention has the light, you should
be able to see through that person just like

17:10.789 --> 17:13.189
an x-ray you should know where the problem
is.

17:13.189 --> 17:18.819
Then, if your attention is enlightened, you
should be able to help that person also, with

17:18.819 --> 17:20.630
your attention, by paying [attention].

17:20.630 --> 17:27.570
Enlightenment is the enlightenment by the
Divine Power of love.

17:27.570 --> 17:33.750
So if you pay attention to somebody, that
love must act.

17:33.750 --> 17:37.820
Otherwise it is just like any other attention:
You pay attention to this, nothing happens.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.620
You pay attention to that, nothing happens.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.030
You pay attention to anyone, nothing happens.

17:42.030 --> 17:45.970
But when you are enlightened, then your attention
is enlightened.

17:45.970 --> 17:51.120
And you will find, after Sahaja Yoga, if you
pay attention to someone, you can cure that

17:51.120 --> 17:52.120
person.

17:52.120 --> 17:58.500
If you have reached a certain stage of maturity
in Sahaj Yog.

17:58.500 --> 18:04.510
Like there was one of the first Sahaja yogis
in England who got his Realisation, who is

18:04.510 --> 18:06.030
here I think.

18:06.030 --> 18:07.190
He was a little doubtful.

18:07.190 --> 18:12.220
And he said, “Mother you said that our attention
gets enlightened: how are we to know about

18:12.220 --> 18:13.220
other people?”

18:13.220 --> 18:14.220
I said, “Very easy!

18:14.220 --> 18:15.780
About whom do you want to know?”

18:15.780 --> 18:16.820
He said, “I want to know about my father."

18:16.820 --> 18:17.890
I said, “All right."

18:17.890 --> 18:19.230
His father was in Scotland.

18:19.230 --> 18:22.429
“You put your hands and think of your father.

18:22.429 --> 18:23.429
Just think."

18:23.429 --> 18:25.520
He started a burning here.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.980
Now these are the centres for your father
(right hand) and these are the centres for

18:28.980 --> 18:30.630
your mother (left hand).

18:30.630 --> 18:32.169
And this started burning.

18:32.169 --> 18:34.650
Now this finger denotes this centre (Vishuddhi).

18:34.650 --> 18:42.410
So I told him he must be down with very bad
bronchitis.

18:42.410 --> 18:44.330
He said, “How can there be telecommunication?”

18:44.330 --> 18:49.450
This is enlightenment, into a new world of
telecommunication!

18:49.450 --> 18:51.910
I said, “All right you ring up your father!”

18:51.910 --> 18:52.910
He rang up his father.

18:52.910 --> 18:56.700
And the father never came to the phone.

18:56.700 --> 19:04.230
And his mother said, “Your father is down
with very bad bronchitis."

19:04.230 --> 19:07.580
Now sitting down here you can give cure to
that.

19:07.580 --> 19:11.870
Now it’s not a cock and bull story, I must
tell you.

19:11.870 --> 19:15.270
It is so fantastic, that people can’t believe
it.

19:15.270 --> 19:16.750
But you can.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.110
But you have to have certain maturity to do
that.

19:19.110 --> 19:22.710
If your light is a little hazy, then it doesn’t
work out.

19:22.710 --> 19:28.270
I mean, you can cure people, sitting down
here, sitting down in London: I should say,

19:28.270 --> 19:32.570
most humbly I can cure them; I have done it.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.220
And some other people have done it also.

19:35.220 --> 19:40.110
So what happens is that the attention which
goes there…Now for example, our attention

19:40.110 --> 19:41.110
is dead in a way.

19:41.110 --> 19:42.590
If it goes there, what happens?

19:42.590 --> 19:44.320
Only thoughts start coming to us.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.900
On the contrary this [thought] is more dominating
[to us] than ourselves.

19:46.900 --> 19:49.299
Because as soon as we look at something, some
thought starts coming.

19:49.299 --> 19:52.870
I mean, you can’t look at anything without
some thoughts coming into your head.

19:52.870 --> 19:57.490
I mean, imagine the domination of the matter
on us, that everything gives us a thought!

19:57.490 --> 20:01.970
While, when you look at a thing, when you
are a realised-soul, then this attention acts.

20:01.970 --> 20:09.700
If it is a living thing, you can see the action
working on that.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.230
But if it is dead, then what happens?

20:12.230 --> 20:14.690
Then you become thoughtless.

20:14.690 --> 20:22.860
Say you see a beautiful painting, you see
a beautiful painting: now there is no thought

20:22.860 --> 20:28.762
in your mind; so all the creation of that
painting just starts pouring in you as joy.

20:28.762 --> 20:33.200
You feel that joy just pouring into you, because
there is no thought in between.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.260
Otherwise normally we’ll think, “Who has
painted this picture?”

20:36.260 --> 20:37.850
“Who has done this?”

20:37.850 --> 20:38.850
How much they must have paid?”

20:38.850 --> 20:39.850
That’s the first thing!

20:39.850 --> 20:42.260
First question would be how much money it
must have cost!

20:42.260 --> 20:44.730
Then second would be, “Who is the artist?”

20:44.730 --> 20:54.130
All these questions actually paralyse the
beauty, the art, the creation of that painting.

20:54.130 --> 21:04.330
Like [on] a wave-free surface of some lake,
you can see the complete image, the reflection,

21:04.330 --> 21:08.560
of the surroundings of that lake.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.110
The complete creation, the complete joy comes
to us.

21:10.110 --> 21:12.960
In the same way you become absolutely thoughtless.

21:12.960 --> 21:19.890
You see something and you become absolutely
thoughtless, because the joy is so complete,

21:19.890 --> 21:25.990
that you just get stunned and the whole thing
starts pouring into you, like showers of joy.

21:25.990 --> 21:29.270
It’s an experience which you cannot have
before Realisation.

21:29.270 --> 21:35.200
It’s only possible after Realisation: that
you can enjoy your attention.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.370
And it is such a joker.

21:37.370 --> 21:42.770
Your attention plays tricks and tells you
so many things about other people.

21:42.770 --> 21:47.360
Like, I was coming and I said, “Now let
us see.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.820
This gentleman, I have to meet him.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.750
Let me see his vibrations."

21:51.750 --> 21:52.900
I said, “Now.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.299
His vibrations: this is catching."

21:54.299 --> 21:55.570
All right, what does that mean?

21:55.570 --> 22:02.110
A problem with his wife: either he has no
wife, or if he has a wife, it’s a wrong

22:02.110 --> 22:03.616
relationship, or maybe there’s a problem
with the wife.

22:03.616 --> 22:07.200
This is wife’s [centre].

22:07.200 --> 22:09.090
And we discovered it was so.

22:09.090 --> 22:11.240
But because I knew about it, I didn’t touch
that point.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.090
Because if you say that, you will have it!

22:13.090 --> 22:14.430
So better not say that point.

22:14.430 --> 22:18.270
You know already about the gentleman, what
sort of a problem he has, so better not touch

22:18.270 --> 22:21.700
that point and gradually try to remove it.

22:21.700 --> 22:26.610
Like that, it is so easy, after Realisation,
to know about others.

22:26.610 --> 22:33.160
Like a gentleman came to see me, he was an
Indian and he knew that a person who is a

22:33.160 --> 22:37.549
seeker is not supposed to drink, when you
come at least to a holy person.

22:37.549 --> 22:42.830
But he gave up his drinking: for about eight
days he did not drink, he had a bath everything;

22:42.830 --> 22:46.630
he had a nice mouthwash with everything and
he came and saw me.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.900
And I said, “You have to give up your alcohol
completely."

22:48.900 --> 22:52.570
He said, “Mother how do you know this?”

22:52.570 --> 22:53.960
I said, “I know!”

22:53.960 --> 22:58.480
Because the centres that are catching in him
are only possible if you are a drunkard.

22:58.480 --> 23:02.600
And I said, “You have been a drunkard, and
that is why it has been there."

23:02.600 --> 23:04.350
He agreed that, “I was.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.169
But eight days back I gave it up.

23:06.169 --> 23:08.190
I said, “Eight days makes no difference!

23:08.190 --> 23:11.860
I know that you have been a drunkard, and
you’ll have to give up that gradually."

23:11.860 --> 23:14.200
He said, “I will Mother, I promise you."

23:14.200 --> 23:17.010
But this is really surprised him: how did
I know about it?

23:17.010 --> 23:24.960
So much so that once a lady came to see me,
and I found that her right hand here, was

23:24.960 --> 23:30.510
completely charring, and this was all catching.

23:30.510 --> 23:34.020
So I asked her, “What is your relationship
with your father?”

23:34.020 --> 23:35.929
Especially this finger.

23:35.929 --> 23:39.450
“Oh,” she said, “what has it to do with
it?”.

23:39.450 --> 23:44.040
Normally girls in India are very attached
to their fathers and, it’s a very good relationship.

23:44.040 --> 23:48.990
I said, “There must be something wrong,
otherwise you can’t get such horrible feelings

23:48.990 --> 23:49.990
about it."

23:49.990 --> 23:51.190
“Yes but how do you know Mother?”

23:51.190 --> 23:52.750
I said, “I know, you better tell me."

23:52.750 --> 23:54.429
“Oh, it’s all right, it’s all right.

23:54.429 --> 23:56.590
We have a good relationship, nothing wrong,
this, that."

23:56.590 --> 23:57.590
I said, “Really?”

23:57.590 --> 23:59.210
She said, “Yes, we have no [problem].

23:59.210 --> 24:01.350
I mean, it’s perfectly all right!”

24:01.350 --> 24:02.350
And she went away.

24:02.350 --> 24:06.690
I was wondering; I knew she was telling me
lies.

24:06.690 --> 24:11.720
Just after that, her mother came in, and her
father and they said, “Oh that was our daughter

24:11.720 --> 24:12.900
who had come to see you."

24:12.900 --> 24:13.900
I said, “Really?”

24:13.900 --> 24:20.150
He said, “Do you know this girl has filed
a [law] suit against me, her father?”

24:20.150 --> 24:21.150
“Really?”

24:21.150 --> 24:22.150
“Yes!

24:22.150 --> 24:23.150
And on wrong basis.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.179
Under the advice of a very wrong person.

24:25.179 --> 24:28.540
Her husband is abroad, and some wrong person
has put ideas into her head, and she has filed

24:28.540 --> 24:33.360
a suit against me."

24:33.360 --> 24:34.970
“Aaaah!”

24:34.970 --> 24:35.970
I said, “See!

24:35.970 --> 24:36.970
That’s what happened!”

24:36.970 --> 24:39.799
So the attention gives you all the information:
when it is enlightened.

24:39.799 --> 24:42.770
It corrects the problems.

24:42.770 --> 24:49.590
And of all the things it warns you, it warns
you beforehand.

24:49.590 --> 24:54.500
For a Sahaja Yogi, supposing a Sahaja Yogi
is misled, he loses the way, then it is accepted

24:54.500 --> 24:57.750
that we have to go that way, there is something
we have to do.

24:57.750 --> 25:01.029
And just he goes that way and he finds the
thing that he has lost for a long time, or

25:01.029 --> 25:05.320
he meets a friend whom he has to meet or some
address that he had, he gets it.

25:05.320 --> 25:12.289
We don’t mind getting lost or anything because
you find that this was necessary to go that

25:12.289 --> 25:13.990
way to find something.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.631
It’s so interesting and so interwoven.

25:15.631 --> 25:21.650
And sometimes you start understanding, after
some time, that there are angels who are looking

25:21.650 --> 25:22.650
after you.

25:22.650 --> 25:26.669
Definitely there are angels who are guiding
us.

25:26.669 --> 25:33.590
Every moment, they are there, and taking our
attention to things which are important.

25:33.590 --> 25:39.850
Because of Spirit’s quality, to be collectively
conscious, our attention itself becomes collectively

25:39.850 --> 25:40.850
conscious.

25:40.850 --> 25:43.799
The priorities change.

25:43.799 --> 25:47.470
The priorities change so much.

25:47.470 --> 25:55.360
Like I was going in Kashmir one day, in a
car, and suddenly I told my husband, that

25:55.360 --> 25:59.179
there is tremendous vibrations in this place.

25:59.179 --> 26:03.390
So he asked the driver: he said, “Is there
any temple here?”

26:03.390 --> 26:05.679
He said, “No, it’s a wilderness.

26:05.679 --> 26:07.240
There is no temple, nothing!”

26:07.240 --> 26:08.970
I said, “About two, three miles maybe.

26:08.970 --> 26:09.970
Let’s go ahead."

26:09.970 --> 26:11.920
So he said, “No there’s some muslims staying
here.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.159
There’s no temple, no question of having
a temple."

26:14.159 --> 26:16.190
I said, “Is there a mosque?”

26:16.190 --> 26:17.549
“Oh,” he said, “Yes.

26:17.549 --> 26:20.409
There is a mosque of Hazratbal!”

26:20.409 --> 26:25.270
One hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept in that
mosque.

26:25.270 --> 26:28.970
And I felt the vibrations at least four, five
miles away from it!

26:28.970 --> 26:29.970
Just imagine!

26:29.970 --> 26:33.770
And when we came about three miles, I could
just tell him how to go there.

26:33.770 --> 26:36.760
And only one hair was emitting [so many] vibrations.

26:36.760 --> 26:41.640
So the whole priority, the attention, goes
to things which have good, Divine vibrations.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.360
It is not bothered about things which have
no good vibrations.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.390
Whatever has good vibrations, it will go to
that.

26:48.390 --> 26:52.750
Like a person who is a holy person, he touches
anything, it vibrates.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.039
He touches water, it vibrates.

26:55.039 --> 26:59.070
Anything you touch, anything you feel, it
vibrates it.

26:59.070 --> 27:04.590
For example, water, if you vibrate it, it
can be a medicine.

27:04.590 --> 27:07.679
River Ganges is nothing but vibrated water!

27:07.679 --> 27:09.640
You get vibrations from that.

27:09.640 --> 27:16.510
These vibrations are Divine vibrations, are
the vibrations of the power of love of God.

27:16.510 --> 27:21.580
It is something so much out of the blue, that
suddenly if you hear about these things, it

27:21.580 --> 27:27.850
sounds quite odd and fantastic But it is not
at all to Indians, they know about all it.

27:27.850 --> 27:30.200
This knowledge has not come to us.

27:30.200 --> 27:34.390
But in the Bible, Christ has said that, “Your
hands will speak."

27:34.390 --> 27:39.169
Your hands will speak: that means in your
hands you will be feeling it.

27:39.169 --> 27:41.510
He said it very clearly.

27:41.510 --> 27:44.490
Your hands will speak: that is what should
happen to us.

27:44.490 --> 27:49.970
That our hands should speak, means they should
communicate to us what they have to communicate.

27:49.970 --> 27:53.890
Because all the centres are represented in
our hand.

27:53.890 --> 27:58.760
As shown there you can see all the centres
are on the left hand side and right hand side,

27:58.760 --> 28:03.240
you can see very clearly how these centres
are denoted on our hand.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.809
And once you start feeling them, if you know
the decoding of it, you can immediately say

28:07.809 --> 28:12.559
what the other person is suffering from, what
you are suffering from.

28:12.559 --> 28:18.210
And then you have to learn how to correct
them, those problems of the another person.

28:18.210 --> 28:24.760
So the first thing that happens to you [is]
that your attention becomes enlightened.

28:24.760 --> 28:36.110
This attention is so wonderful, is so joy-giving,
it’s so humorous, because you become like

28:36.110 --> 28:38.919
a witness; the whole thing becomes a joke.

28:38.919 --> 28:44.540
You see people seriously running up and down
to do something, and you just don’t understand.

28:44.540 --> 28:48.340
And you ask them, “What’s the matter with
you?”

28:48.340 --> 28:49.340
“Oh, you don’t know?

28:49.340 --> 28:50.340
It’s very important, very important!”

28:50.340 --> 28:51.340
“Yes what?”

28:51.340 --> 28:52.850
“I have put all my money for the race."

28:52.850 --> 28:57.000
And he comes back, head hung!

28:57.000 --> 28:58.390
“What happened?”

28:58.390 --> 29:01.250
“I lost all my money!”

29:01.250 --> 29:02.840
The way he was running, the way he is coming
back, is a big joke.

29:02.840 --> 29:07.471
But to him it’s not: he becomes serious,
sometimes he becomes involved into in, sometimes

29:07.471 --> 29:10.700
elated, but you are just enjoying the whole
joke.

29:10.700 --> 29:15.230
The whole tragedy and comedy of life you enjoy,
like a spectator.

29:15.230 --> 29:20.380
You become the spectator: you are no more
worried, upset or in tension.

29:20.380 --> 29:26.070
Actually I have seen people who are very hot
tempered become so placid and so sweet and

29:26.070 --> 29:27.070
so poised.

29:27.070 --> 29:32.630
It’s surprising how they change, because
they have got the balancing point, the absolute

29:32.630 --> 29:33.630
point.

29:33.630 --> 29:36.230
This is what happens to your attention when
you get Realisation.

29:36.230 --> 29:42.549
But then what happens to your awareness, which
you get from the central path of your evolution?

29:42.549 --> 29:47.409
For example animals have an awareness.

29:47.409 --> 29:49.850
Also we have an awareness.

29:49.850 --> 29:53.060
We have awareness much higher than that of
animals.

29:53.060 --> 29:56.730
Some people say, “Yes we can play tennis,
you see."

29:56.730 --> 29:59.970
that’s a higher awareness than animals.

29:59.970 --> 30:02.750
But some people cannot play tennis or understand
it.

30:02.750 --> 30:08.299
But one awareness human beings have, definitely
— whatever they may be, at whatever level

30:08.299 --> 30:12.149
— that they understand what is dirty, what
is filthy.

30:12.149 --> 30:14.340
They can smell it; animals can’t.

30:14.340 --> 30:21.149
You take a horse or a dog through a dirty
length, it will just walk like a king, as

30:21.149 --> 30:25.600
if it’s leading a parade for the queen — it
has no problems.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.230
But for human beings we just can’t do it!

30:27.230 --> 30:30.549
We have to put something to cover our nose.

30:30.549 --> 30:36.250
So, like that, we have many other things which
we have achieved as human beings.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.799
We have sense of colour, we have sense of
beauty, we have sense of balance.

30:39.799 --> 30:46.850
We have so many things, which dogs may not
have, horses may not have, dolphins may not

30:46.850 --> 30:47.850
have.

30:47.850 --> 30:51.059
They are so close to us — they live with
us — but they may not have those senses

30:51.059 --> 30:52.740
as we have.

30:52.740 --> 30:58.760
But now, what happens to human awareness,
at this stage, is that this human awareness

30:58.760 --> 31:00.690
suddenly jumps up into a new dimension.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.799
You become collectively conscious.

31:02.799 --> 31:03.860
You become!

31:03.860 --> 31:04.860
Again, I say.

31:04.860 --> 31:09.570
It’s an actualisation: it happens to your
awareness.

31:09.570 --> 31:12.299
You just become collectively conscious.

31:12.299 --> 31:20.240
Means, little children, today Olympia, she
was interviewing me, she came and she put

31:20.240 --> 31:25.210
her fingers in her ears, because the lady
who was talking to me had a problem in her

31:25.210 --> 31:27.080
throat.

31:27.080 --> 31:31.360
Perhaps maybe she has to use her throat too
much also, or maybe something else.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.940
So she put her fingers in her ears.

31:32.940 --> 31:36.120
You see, this is the mantra we use “Allah
hu akbar” by putting fingers.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.649
The little one, she is very small, about two
years of age, she just put in.

31:39.649 --> 31:46.320
But still she felt she has not helped me fully,
so she put both her fingers in the mouth to

31:46.320 --> 31:50.090
suggest that please look after the lady, she’s
got this problem.

31:50.090 --> 31:57.880
The concern and the feeling that you get for
another person is so tremendous, so tremendous,

31:57.880 --> 32:01.980
that people can’t understand but it’s
very simple [to explain], because if you become

32:01.980 --> 32:05.820
part and parcel of the person, how can you
not have concern?

32:05.820 --> 32:07.700
I mean who is the other?

32:07.700 --> 32:11.649
The problem is [that] now, supposing you are
sitting before me, and you have a problem

32:11.649 --> 32:14.380
in your stomach, I’ll also have a little
problem.

32:14.380 --> 32:18.680
And I’ll be so concerned about that problem
that it is as if in my stomach that problem

32:18.680 --> 32:19.899
is existing.

32:19.899 --> 32:21.070
It is like that.

32:21.070 --> 32:25.740
The awareness becomes so collectively conscious
that it becomes part and parcel of you.

32:25.740 --> 32:26.900
Who is the other?

32:26.900 --> 32:29.580
The feeling of otherness goes away.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.929
Now people talk big things like, “We are
all united,” “We are all brothers and

32:32.929 --> 32:35.060
sisters, and this and this."

32:35.060 --> 32:36.390
You must have heard all these speeches.

32:36.390 --> 32:39.760
And when it comes to war, they’ll fight.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.140
But in this, you cannot fight, because who
is the other?

32:42.140 --> 32:43.140
You can’t fight your nose.

32:43.140 --> 32:44.210
You can’t fight your hand.

32:44.210 --> 32:45.730
You can’t fight your fingers.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.240
Nor do you help anyone.

32:47.240 --> 32:48.460
You don’t help anyone.

32:48.460 --> 32:53.669
Because supposing this finger is in trouble
and this hand presses it, does it help it?

32:53.669 --> 32:54.669
Nothing!

32:54.669 --> 32:56.350
This is neither obliged, nor this is helping.

32:56.350 --> 32:57.519
This is one.

32:57.519 --> 33:03.800
That feeling of oneness — that you are part
and parcel of the whole is — established.

33:03.800 --> 33:08.630
Because of that feeling, that is such a tremendous
feeling that you are part and parcel of the

33:08.630 --> 33:10.960
whole, that you get cured.

33:10.960 --> 33:21.840
The curing comes because of that innate understanding
by your being, that you are not alone: you

33:21.840 --> 33:29.060
are part and parcel of the whole, you are
a cell of the whole body of God, or you are

33:29.060 --> 33:31.610
a microcosm of the macrocosm.

33:31.610 --> 33:37.590
This is not just a psychological or a rational
thing, but you just become.

33:37.590 --> 33:40.109
You just become, you can’t help it.

33:40.109 --> 33:44.000
And when you are that, you just don’t feel
you are helping anyone.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.700
It’s just like one cell acting for another
cell.

33:47.700 --> 33:51.240
The whole thing works in such a homogeneous
way: no fighting, no quarrelling.

33:51.240 --> 33:55.010
On the contrary, you enjoy each other!

33:55.010 --> 33:57.140
You just love each other.

33:57.140 --> 33:59.390
And you just see the good points of another
person.

33:59.390 --> 34:00.830
You don’t see the bad points.

34:00.830 --> 34:05.019
You forget the race, you forget all creeds,
and everything you forget.

34:05.019 --> 34:08.140
Because a nose doesn’t say, “I am higher
than the hands!”

34:08.140 --> 34:09.140
Does it say?

34:09.140 --> 34:11.790
Or the feet do not say, “I am lower than
the hands!”

34:11.790 --> 34:12.790
They all are required.

34:12.790 --> 34:16.349
Supposing there is something wrong with the
feet, you will just try to help.

34:16.349 --> 34:18.669
Something wrong with the nose, you’ll help
your nose.

34:18.669 --> 34:20.740
You don’t discriminate in your body, do
you?

34:20.740 --> 34:23.530
In the same way, we do not discriminate.

34:23.530 --> 34:28.919
Once you become realised-souls, whether you
are from India or from Asia, or from any other

34:28.919 --> 34:31.061
place, from England, America, any place you
may be.

34:31.061 --> 34:36.250
You may be Chinese: every sort of faces that
we have, in the cross section of Sahaja Yogis!

34:36.250 --> 34:40.500
You will find all kinds of people are there,
and they all love each other.

34:40.500 --> 34:45.090
You must see the way when these people from
England went to India, to the villages where

34:45.090 --> 34:47.460
I worked: the villagers just grabbed them!

34:47.460 --> 34:53.480
And they were so happy: they said, “First
time we are meeting our brothers and sisters!”

34:53.480 --> 34:56.820
And these people were just enjoying them,
and they all started dancing.

34:56.820 --> 35:00.900
Of course they are very light-footed and they
wanted all these people to dance with them.

35:00.900 --> 35:05.260
And though the Britishers are not so light-footed
as they are, so they found it rather difficult.

35:05.260 --> 35:06.970
So they made them jump, jump, jump!

35:06.970 --> 35:11.760
And now they have become good dancers too;
and they all dance together and sing together,

35:11.760 --> 35:14.430
in complete joy and understanding.

35:14.430 --> 35:17.119
The whole attitude towards life changes.

35:17.119 --> 35:22.900
You become really a princess in the sense
that you don’t need anything — there is

35:22.900 --> 35:23.900
no dearth.

35:23.900 --> 35:26.109
If there is a dearth then you are beggar.

35:26.109 --> 35:29.380
If there is no dearth, you can sleep here,
you can sleep in a palace.

35:29.380 --> 35:33.859
If you want you can get a Rolls Royce or if
you want, you can walk.

35:33.859 --> 35:35.089
What’s the harm?

35:35.089 --> 35:36.329
What’s the difference?

35:36.329 --> 35:40.599
Because the joy comes from your Spirit, not
from outside things.

35:40.599 --> 35:42.720
The whole idea of comfort changes.

35:42.720 --> 35:45.190
The whole idea of luxury changes.

35:45.190 --> 35:50.380
It’s all completely changed because you
enter into this new dimension.

35:50.380 --> 35:54.740
And that’s what happens to your awareness:
that you become collectively conscious.

35:54.740 --> 36:01.500
The enlightenment gives a human awareness
a new dimension by which you are collectively

36:01.500 --> 36:02.650
conscious.

36:02.650 --> 36:08.530
Now emotion gives us happiness: if you love
somebody you feel happy, and [if] you meet

36:08.530 --> 36:10.530
that person you feel happy.

36:10.530 --> 36:13.349
And you want to bestow all your love on that
person.

36:13.349 --> 36:17.490
If your children are there, you want to love
them, and give them love.

36:17.490 --> 36:21.170
But before Realisation, this joy is limited.

36:21.170 --> 36:24.880
For example, husband wife relation I can understand.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.940
But about children, like in India: they love
their children so much that they will even

36:28.940 --> 36:31.200
sell their country for their children’s
sake.

36:31.200 --> 36:33.829
The love becomes like a possession.

36:33.829 --> 36:36.470
It becomes a love hate relationship.

36:36.470 --> 36:38.940
They love so much that they come to hatred.

36:38.940 --> 36:41.710
It’s a funny thing but it happens.

36:41.710 --> 36:42.710
Why?

36:42.710 --> 36:44.190
Because it has limitations.

36:44.190 --> 36:48.210
Love has limitations: it’s not infinite.

36:48.210 --> 36:53.220
But when you get your love enlightened you
get joy.

36:53.220 --> 37:00.200
There’s no material given thing, just you
enjoy each other.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.109
In Calcutta first time on my way to America
I had gone.

37:03.109 --> 37:07.700
I was staying in a hotel and there were five
or six other Sahaja Yogis staying with me,

37:07.700 --> 37:08.700
in other rooms.

37:08.700 --> 37:14.230
And one gentleman came to see me, and he fell
at my feet, and tremendous vibrations he had.

37:14.230 --> 37:17.329
And they all rushed: “Who has come?

37:17.329 --> 37:18.650
Who has come?”

37:18.650 --> 37:19.980
I said, “Why?”

37:19.980 --> 37:22.170
“Tremendous joy started flowing on our head,
Mother!

37:22.170 --> 37:23.170
Who is at your feet?”

37:23.170 --> 37:24.170
They all rushed to me.

37:24.170 --> 37:27.140
I said, “See this one."

37:27.140 --> 37:28.140
“Haahh!”

37:28.140 --> 37:31.619
They all stood, ‘Haahh!

37:31.619 --> 37:32.619
What enjoyment!

37:32.619 --> 37:33.619
What enjoyment!”

37:33.619 --> 37:34.619
He was enjoying.

37:34.619 --> 37:35.619
They were enjoying him.

37:35.619 --> 37:36.619
This is the first time you enjoy human beings.

37:36.619 --> 37:39.970
Because you can feel the vibrations of a person.

37:39.970 --> 37:46.320
What a beauty [a] human being is, what a glory
he is, what a blessing he is, what a creation

37:46.320 --> 37:49.870
he is, you realise only after Realisation.

37:49.870 --> 37:55.650
Before that, you judge him — “Oh he has
got long hair,” “He has got red hair,”

37:55.650 --> 37:59.220
“He has got long nose” — All that.

37:59.220 --> 38:01.640
But then you just see him in a subtle way.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.410
What he is, is his vibrations.

38:04.410 --> 38:07.901
And so many people I have seen — Sahaja
Yogis also — if they get somebody they’ll

38:07.901 --> 38:08.901
all rush there.

38:08.901 --> 38:12.180
The fellow is there, and they are all taking
vibrations, for half an hour and I am tired.

38:12.180 --> 38:14.240
I say, “Now finish it off!”

38:14.240 --> 38:19.450
But no they are just sucking it like a child.

38:19.450 --> 38:26.730
First time you enjoy human beings — the
joy which has not duality.

38:26.730 --> 38:30.099
Joy does not have happiness and unhappiness.

38:30.099 --> 38:33.109
Happiness comes to us when our ego is pampered.

38:33.109 --> 38:37.810
Unhappiness comes to us when our ego is damped.

38:37.810 --> 38:38.890
It is something different.

38:38.890 --> 38:41.980
We are not our egos, we are our Self.

38:41.980 --> 38:45.700
And when Self enjoys something, it enjoys
it.

38:45.700 --> 38:51.160
There is no remorse, there is no duality about
it, there is no unhappiness.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.080
So joy is a complete thing.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.170
It cannot be described.

38:55.170 --> 38:58.780
It is just to be experienced, and enjoyed
within ourselves.

38:58.780 --> 39:00.290
And that’s what happens to us.

39:00.290 --> 39:06.230
When we get our Realisation our idea of love
changes.

39:06.230 --> 39:10.530
Like, you say, “Oh I love this person only."

39:10.530 --> 39:14.930
Like your husband is there, you have to love
him like a husband.

39:14.930 --> 39:16.070
You don’t love everybody like a husband.

39:16.070 --> 39:19.920
Your sister is there, you love her like a
sister.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.720
But you think all others as your sisters.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.720
Then you love your brothers; you think them
to be your brothers.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.320
You love all of them.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.140
The love spreads, like that.

39:29.140 --> 39:32.030
It does not rest in one place.

39:32.030 --> 39:38.170
It does not stagnate, it does not coagulate.

39:38.170 --> 39:45.110
Supposing in a plant, sap is rising and it
goes to one flower because it loves it, and

39:45.110 --> 39:46.119
settles down there.

39:46.119 --> 39:48.890
The tree will die and the flower will die.

39:48.890 --> 39:55.260
So the love we have before Realisation, is
like that love, which dies ultimately or creates

39:55.260 --> 39:57.260
problems and it dies.

39:57.260 --> 40:01.200
But love after Realisation is a love that
emits, just flows.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.900
You don’t get anything.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.640
“What do you get?”

40:04.640 --> 40:05.640
people ask me.

40:05.640 --> 40:11.420
I mean my husband is in a different line and
I have a double life, and all my friends ask,

40:11.420 --> 40:13.339
“What do you get out of it?”

40:13.339 --> 40:15.700
I say, “I am not here to get.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.710
I get out something from me.

40:17.710 --> 40:20.500
It’s just to give, is to enjoy."

40:20.500 --> 40:23.510
As I told your mayor today, “Your politics
will be solved.

40:23.510 --> 40:24.510
You’ll have no parties."

40:24.510 --> 40:25.599
He said, “How can that be?”

40:25.599 --> 40:32.790
I said, “See now: I have supposing all the
powers, so I am a capitalist.

40:32.790 --> 40:34.599
But I must share, so I’m a communist.

40:34.599 --> 40:38.260
I have to be a pure communist and a pure capitalist.

40:38.260 --> 40:44.420
So how can I have two parties when both the
things exist within me?”

40:44.420 --> 40:45.420
That’s how you solve your politics.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.420
How do you solve your economics?

40:46.420 --> 40:52.440
The whole transaction areas and all those
things come from a false idea that matter

40:52.440 --> 40:55.540
can give us happiness: it cannot.

40:55.540 --> 41:01.720
Only the matter that has a certain coefficience,
which gives vibrations, is the only thing

41:01.720 --> 41:02.720
that gives you joy.

41:02.720 --> 41:05.490
Now we don’t know if there is such matter
around.

41:05.490 --> 41:08.130
For example somebody will say Stonehenge.

41:08.130 --> 41:10.460
I mean, it looks funny with the druids.

41:10.460 --> 41:12.560
Of course they don’t know anything, I agree.

41:12.560 --> 41:18.859
But it is not [funny], because Stonehenge
is created by the Mother Earth.

41:18.859 --> 41:19.859
It has vibrations.

41:19.859 --> 41:24.230
They can’t feel anything, they are standing
there, singing songs, this, that.

41:24.230 --> 41:26.860
Somebody must have felt in their forefathers.

41:26.860 --> 41:33.260
There are many places where you get vibrations
from the Mother Earth, so many.

41:33.260 --> 41:38.040
It is written in the Bible, in the ten commandments,
only that whatever is created by the Mother

41:38.040 --> 41:43.890
Earth or by the sky should not be reproduced
by human beings and worshipped.

41:43.890 --> 41:47.980
But there are many things which have come
out of the Mother Earth.

41:47.980 --> 41:51.380
But unless and until you have vibrations,
how will you know?

41:51.380 --> 41:52.700
You don’t know the truth.

41:52.700 --> 41:56.410
So in the human awareness, to know the truth,
is very relative.

41:56.410 --> 42:01.310
You will say that, “How is it that this
person is fake and that person is not fake?”

42:01.310 --> 42:03.119
“This is truth that is not truth?”

42:03.119 --> 42:04.619
There’s no way of knowing it.

42:04.619 --> 42:08.730
Unless and until you get to the Absolute point,
how will you know the relative?

42:08.730 --> 42:11.650
So when you get your Realisation, you can
ask, “Is he a real man?”

42:11.650 --> 42:16.180
If he is, you will get vibrations.

42:16.180 --> 42:24.470
If he’s not, then, you might even get blisters;
vibrations will stop maybe; little bit blisters

42:24.470 --> 42:27.700
you might get, if he is not a right type of
a person.

42:27.700 --> 42:30.579
If somebody is obstinate, you will get indication.

42:30.579 --> 42:34.253
If somebody is suffering from some possession,
you will get indication.

42:34.253 --> 42:37.930
If somebody is mentally mad, you will know.

42:37.930 --> 42:41.980
It’s very, very systematic, and very scientific.

42:41.980 --> 42:49.160
God’s laws never fail, [are] very attentive,
and everything that you know through it is

42:49.160 --> 42:50.619
absolute and correct.

42:50.619 --> 42:55.770
Only thing is you have to learn: you have
to train up your mind to understand these

42:55.770 --> 42:56.770
different things.

42:56.770 --> 43:02.580
But small children are much cleverer than
bigger people; because you see, they have

43:02.580 --> 43:07.470
so many hangups, they have so many complications,
they rationalise everything.

43:07.470 --> 43:12.910
Children will just say this: “This is this!”

43:12.910 --> 43:17.880
Now people think that, “How can it be free?”

43:17.880 --> 43:21.360
How can it be with money?

43:21.360 --> 43:23.400
I ask the other question!

43:23.400 --> 43:28.710
We cannot think of these things in the terms
that I’d say [is] Divine, because you have

43:28.710 --> 43:30.569
never known it before.

43:30.569 --> 43:33.270
How much money did Christ get?

43:33.270 --> 43:39.060
We have a life here of Christ: how much money
did he take?

43:39.060 --> 43:43.480
Now Christianity as such — they asked me
a question today — I mean it cannot deliver

43:43.480 --> 43:44.500
the goods!

43:44.500 --> 43:52.900
They are Christians, they go to church, but
is their life Christian?

43:52.900 --> 43:54.369
Churches cannot deliver the goods.

43:54.369 --> 43:57.430
But that doesn’t mean that you run away
from Christ.

43:57.430 --> 44:02.650
You can run away from that kind of things,
but not from Christ, because Christ exists.

44:02.650 --> 44:08.830
He definitely exists within us, and is a special
person because he’s placed at a very pivotal

44:08.830 --> 44:24.589
point, between the centre of the optic chiasma,
where the pituitary and pineal body are there

44:24.589 --> 44:27.310
and he controls our ego and superego.

44:27.310 --> 44:31.710
And when the Kundalini rises, then Christ
is awakened, and he sucks all of our karmas,

44:31.710 --> 44:32.970
all of our sins.

44:32.970 --> 44:36.569
That’s what he said — that he has suffered
for our sins.

44:36.569 --> 44:42.930
They will say Christ, in the church they say
it, and then why do they ask you to suffer?

44:42.930 --> 44:46.800
If Christ has suffered, why should we suffer
anymore?

44:46.800 --> 44:49.920
There should be no sufferings anymore, just
enjoy and rejoice.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.800
He’s done everything for us.

44:51.800 --> 44:53.500
Or do you want him to suffer more?

44:53.500 --> 44:59.810
There are Jews who said, that, “We don’t
believe in Christ, and we have to suffer."

44:59.810 --> 45:01.650
Already, “Have Mr Hitler for you!”

45:01.650 --> 45:04.590
If they want another one, they can have another
one.

45:04.590 --> 45:06.450
And go on with your suffering.

45:06.450 --> 45:10.240
It is high time that they accept Christ and
give up their sufferings, otherwise, they

45:10.240 --> 45:13.610
are putting their sufferings on other people.

45:13.610 --> 45:16.280
There is no suffering needed anymore.

45:16.280 --> 45:22.579
It’s a funny idea, I don’t understand,
why people say you must suffer to become spiritual?

45:22.579 --> 45:25.780
Who has given you these ideas?

45:25.780 --> 45:32.420
Actually among Hindus it was believed that,
our karmas, we have to pay for it.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.839
Yes, all right.

45:33.839 --> 45:35.200
Up to what point?

45:35.200 --> 45:40.260
Till somebody called Mahavishnu comes in:
that is Christ.

45:40.260 --> 45:41.260
He’s called as ‘Mahavishnu’.

45:41.260 --> 45:48.319
All the signs and symptoms of Christ are described
as Mahavishnu in the Devi Mahatmyam, but who

45:48.319 --> 45:49.319
reads that?

45:49.319 --> 45:50.780
I mean Christians will only read Bible!

45:50.780 --> 45:53.690
Will they read something else?

45:53.690 --> 45:54.690
So they never knew.

45:54.690 --> 45:58.040
And when the missionaries went from here,
they never talked about Christ like that.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.630
“Oh,” they just said, “you’d better
get converted."

46:00.630 --> 46:03.160
They used to brand everyone: Christian, Christian,
Christian, Christian.

46:03.160 --> 46:09.780
They would put a loaf of bread in the water,
and say that, “This is the beef, and all

46:09.780 --> 46:11.099
of you have become now Christians!”

46:11.099 --> 46:12.390
So by villages they became Christians.

46:12.390 --> 46:16.690
Imagine this kind of a Christianity, how far
is it going to go?

46:16.690 --> 46:21.210
They never said that Christ is the one who
was Mahavishnu because they never knew.

46:21.210 --> 46:27.680
Until I told them that it was he, the Mahavishnu
who came, who has come already.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.980
And he is going to suck our [karmas].

46:28.980 --> 46:31.150
So this is done, then what?

46:31.150 --> 46:32.599
Why to worry about karmas?

46:32.599 --> 46:33.599
[They are] finished!

46:33.599 --> 46:35.079
All our karmas are over.

46:35.079 --> 46:39.630
But here we have Christ, but we don’t know
his essence.

46:39.630 --> 46:44.140
We don’t know what is he there for, what
was the need for him to crucify himself.

46:44.140 --> 46:52.150
It was just to create a tremendous Deity within
us, that is Christ, who will suck our up our

46:52.150 --> 46:53.150
[bad] vibrations.

46:53.150 --> 46:55.220
Now we have many Jews who are our disciples.

46:55.220 --> 46:59.360
They will jolly well have to accept Christ,
because Kundalini does not rise unless and

46:59.360 --> 47:00.860
until you accept it here.

47:00.860 --> 47:05.890
But even those Christians who don’t accept,
say Moses, or Jehovah: they have to accept

47:05.890 --> 47:10.250
that Jehovah is sitting here (above Agnya).

47:10.250 --> 47:12.359
That’s the Viraata.

47:12.359 --> 47:17.170
That’s the Akbar: that, you have to see
for yourself when the Kundalini rises.

47:17.170 --> 47:21.970
You’ll be amazed, unless and until you say
Lord’s prayer, it won’t rise above this

47:21.970 --> 47:24.130
(Agnya), if it is stuck there.

47:24.130 --> 47:26.200
And all the Christians have this problem.

47:26.200 --> 47:31.410
You will be surprised that Christ himself
is angry with them.

47:31.410 --> 47:33.099
You have to say Lord’s prayer.

47:33.099 --> 47:37.430
That’s why he said, “You will be calling
me ‘Christ, Christ,’ and I won’t recognise

47:37.430 --> 47:38.430
[you]."

47:38.430 --> 47:41.390
Just imagine!

47:41.390 --> 47:48.590
Then you have to say Lord’s prayer in front
of some holy personality [so that] he forgives

47:48.590 --> 47:53.869
you, and then the Kundalini rises.

47:53.869 --> 47:58.319
Just imagine — he was the one who was the
controller of ego, he is the one who sucks

47:58.319 --> 48:04.160
our ego, and see the Christian nations: if
there is one thing they cannot get out is

48:04.160 --> 48:05.160
their ego.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.410
Now they are realising it, no doubt.

48:06.410 --> 48:10.319
But still to get out of it, they have to fight
it; and the more you fight it, it becomes

48:10.319 --> 48:13.910
like a balloon — big, big, big, big, big.

48:13.910 --> 48:16.390
But by fighting it you cannot get out of it.

48:16.390 --> 48:23.260
Only by rising through the central path you
can suck it, through the awakening of Christ,

48:23.260 --> 48:27.170
and you get your Realisation as cool breeze
coming out of your head.

48:27.170 --> 48:34.980
But when it happens also, as I said, people
do not know what it is — these Brahma Shakti

48:34.980 --> 48:40.300
or what you call this cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost, what it is, because they didn’t allow

48:40.300 --> 48:41.300
Christ to live long.

48:41.300 --> 48:44.520
He lived for hardly three and a half years
to talk about it.

48:44.520 --> 48:50.839
I mean the way they treated him was really
so atrocious and so cruel.

48:50.839 --> 48:56.280
To whom could he talk, to these fishermen?

48:56.280 --> 48:57.280
About Kundalini?

48:57.280 --> 48:59.690
I mean they made it impossible!

48:59.690 --> 49:04.880
Same with Mohammed Sahib: Arabs could not
accept Mohammed at all.

49:04.880 --> 49:10.790
And they have not yet accepted him, the way
they are crucifying him everyday.

49:10.790 --> 49:12.880
He couldn’t tell people about it.

49:12.880 --> 49:17.550
But he did promise that it will happen to
you.

49:17.550 --> 49:23.450
He’s promised that a Comforter will come,
so that you will know my Father forever — means

49:23.450 --> 49:24.450
you will get your Self-Realisation.

49:24.450 --> 49:26.720
He promised it.

49:26.720 --> 49:27.880
But how will you make him out?

49:27.880 --> 49:29.690
How will you make out the Comforter?

49:29.690 --> 49:31.870
How will you find out, if Christ comes in?

49:31.870 --> 49:34.190
Now some ‘christ’ is being announced.

49:34.190 --> 49:35.850
It’s a big joke.

49:35.850 --> 49:39.660
You’d better tell this ‘Mr Christ’ to
walk on the water.

49:39.660 --> 49:41.760
And you’ll find him out!

49:41.760 --> 49:43.579
We had one in India.

49:43.579 --> 49:46.200
He told that he is going to walk on the water.

49:46.200 --> 49:50.480
And mad people from America, they came with
televisions, telescopes, and all Indians were

49:50.480 --> 49:53.099
there to see the fun of the whole thing.

49:53.099 --> 49:57.100
All of them came here and Government also
encouraged people because lots of foreign

49:57.100 --> 49:59.980
exchange, you know, for this kind of tomfoolery!

49:59.980 --> 50:08.750
They all came, they occupied premises in a
very big hotel, where there was a huge big

50:08.750 --> 50:14.670
swimming bath, where this fellow was supposed
to walk on the water.

50:14.670 --> 50:18.119
And they had telescopes and every sort of
thing there.

50:18.119 --> 50:23.680
And apart from that they had a television
set, and from America they were going to release

50:23.680 --> 50:27.080
all the scenes of what was going to happen.

50:27.080 --> 50:30.730
This fellow came forward, it was on the television,
you could see it.

50:30.730 --> 50:33.660
He put one foot, and with the second foot
he was down!

50:33.660 --> 50:34.660
(laughter) He couldn’t even swim!

50:34.660 --> 50:35.660
Can you imagine?

50:35.660 --> 50:38.140
And they had to fish him out!

50:38.140 --> 50:48.410
And he was put in the hospital, and they found
he had cancer.

50:48.410 --> 50:51.550
But imagine, when they asked, “Why did you
do all this?”

50:51.550 --> 50:55.040
He said, “At least I got a name!”

50:55.040 --> 50:56.040
Imagine!

50:56.040 --> 50:58.430
Like some hijackers, they say that, “At
least by doing these things, we will get some

50:58.430 --> 50:59.430
name."

50:59.430 --> 51:03.819
You know there are some maniacs who want to
appear in the newspaper this way or that way.

51:03.819 --> 51:06.310
So he said, “I got a big name, in America.

51:06.310 --> 51:07.490
Everywhere, everyone knows me!”

51:07.490 --> 51:10.780
Thank God he’s no more now to befool some.

51:10.780 --> 51:12.920
You see these tricks they play.

51:12.920 --> 51:15.630
So these tricks have nothing to do with God.

51:15.630 --> 51:18.319
If he’s Christ, let him walk on the water!

51:18.319 --> 51:22.859
If you people will be kind enough, you better
write to this gentleman who has spent so much

51:22.859 --> 51:27.140
money in the newspapers, especially to the
journalists I would request.

51:27.140 --> 51:30.790
Because journalism takes to such stupid people
very easily, I don’t know why.

51:30.790 --> 51:31.790
They will publish.

51:31.790 --> 51:35.819
You know they published such a lot of things
about this nonsensical ‘christ’ who has

51:35.819 --> 51:36.819
come.

51:36.819 --> 51:37.819
Better ask him.

51:37.819 --> 51:41.550
There’s another one who was trying to teach
flying.

51:41.550 --> 51:47.270
Poor things who were flying, one of them is
sitting here, she was the directress of the

51:47.270 --> 51:51.780
institution, got epilepsy, the husband got
epilepsy, the child got epilepsy, all of them.

51:51.780 --> 51:55.520
They lost all their money, all their property,
everything.

51:55.520 --> 51:59.660
That’s how they were flying on the streets
of London.

51:59.660 --> 52:00.770
I said, “Why not ask the guru to fly?

52:00.770 --> 52:04.210
Why not use these leaning tower of Pisa?

52:04.210 --> 52:05.210
Just throw him down.

52:05.210 --> 52:06.660
Let’s see how far he can fly!”

52:06.660 --> 52:08.579
And then they were paying £3,000 to learn
flying nonsense!

52:08.579 --> 52:11.089
Why do you want to fly?

52:11.089 --> 52:17.559
Are you going to become birds now?

52:17.559 --> 52:24.410
Like these nonsensical tricks they play on
you, and you believe them.

52:24.410 --> 52:33.150
It is never said in any scripture, any books,
anywhere that you will be flying as religious

52:33.150 --> 52:37.839
people or as spiritual people — never!

52:37.839 --> 52:41.089
Nor that you will be becoming mad.

52:41.089 --> 52:46.420
Even ‘St’ Paul who was — I don’t know
how they included him in the Bible — I can’t

52:46.420 --> 52:48.339
understand how was he a Christian?

52:48.339 --> 52:49.420
This is first thing.

52:49.420 --> 52:50.780
If he saw the light, well and good.

52:50.780 --> 52:52.430
Who saw the light?

52:52.430 --> 52:57.339
Now supposing you go and say, “I have seen
the light, and I have become a great Christian!”

52:57.339 --> 53:02.099
and you start organising it, must you be included
in Bible?

53:02.099 --> 53:05.000
He has no idea of Christ, and he has no idea
of reality!

53:05.000 --> 53:09.770
When I saw him [in The Bible] I said, “From
where does this gentleman come in?”

53:09.770 --> 53:17.650
He was nowhere near reality and he said, that
people got like mad when Holy Ghost came,

53:17.650 --> 53:23.220
everybody started laughing and they started
saying all kinds of words and all kinds of

53:23.220 --> 53:24.220
languages.

53:24.220 --> 53:27.140
It’s very easy.

53:27.140 --> 53:32.770
You see, say if an Indian possesses you, you
will start behaving just like an Indian: you’ll

53:32.770 --> 53:37.740
speak Indian language, you may be thieving,
telling lies — all these things which are

53:37.740 --> 53:38.740
their character.

53:38.740 --> 53:43.460
Or if you are an English man entered into
an Indian, you will start speaking Oxbridge

53:43.460 --> 53:44.750
English.

53:44.750 --> 53:50.819
It’s possible — you have seen these things
happening to people when they get possessed,

53:50.819 --> 53:52.180
they do it.

53:52.180 --> 53:53.550
It’s all possession.

53:53.550 --> 53:55.970
What is the way to know what you have got?

53:55.970 --> 54:02.240
It’s so much unknown that, anything that
is unknown is not God!

54:02.240 --> 54:07.710
There is collective subconscious, and there
is collective supraconscious.

54:07.710 --> 54:10.380
Anybody can enter in from that area and can
possess us.

54:10.380 --> 54:18.340
You must have seen a film shown by some doctors
who said that cancer is caused by some proteins

54:18.340 --> 54:25.790
— proteins which come to us from the areas
which are built within us since the time of

54:25.790 --> 54:28.460
our creation — that’s collective subconscious.

54:28.460 --> 54:33.280
They say it clearly — protein 58 to protein
52.

54:33.280 --> 54:40.410
They say it so clearly about it that, that
is what triggers our cancer.

54:40.410 --> 54:41.819
But they don’t know how to control them.

54:41.819 --> 54:44.900
Of course, I have been saying this for the
last twelve years!

54:44.900 --> 54:48.520
But nobody understood at that time when I
was saying that it is the collective subconscious

54:48.520 --> 54:51.000
from where these things come in.

54:51.000 --> 54:56.340
Christ is the one who took out [dead] spirits
and put in the pigs.

54:56.340 --> 55:01.400
And here they are talking of Christian movements
like you have got Pentecostals and charismatic

55:01.400 --> 55:04.839
and this and that, where they are putting
spirits into you!

55:04.839 --> 55:09.970
And when they come before me, they shake like
this — just like this — and go into an

55:09.970 --> 55:10.970
epileptic mood.

55:10.970 --> 55:14.140
I sometimes you see there are a hundred spirits
sitting in those people.

55:14.140 --> 55:18.819
They have no idea as to what to do with the
dead, they are so naïve.

55:18.819 --> 55:23.020
In the church you are sitting on a dead body
— God knows how many.

55:23.020 --> 55:26.319
They don’t know how to do that.

55:26.319 --> 55:31.520
For example if an Indian lady from India comes
in, she walks like this, saving her feet,

55:31.520 --> 55:33.620
“Oh God, they are sleeping here!”

55:33.620 --> 55:39.980
We know that when they are buried there, maybe
their dead souls are around.

55:39.980 --> 55:45.270
But here in the church you go: I mean [it’s]
a very nice way of possessing a person!

55:45.270 --> 55:53.549
There’s a Sahaja Yogini in Paris: her mother
was about sixty years of age — not very

55:53.549 --> 55:58.060
old because I am of that age — and she was
so mad, she became so mad, that she did not

55:58.060 --> 56:00.740
know what was a bidet and what was a WC.

56:00.740 --> 56:08.730
And she was a funny woman, and she sometimes
used to forget even her daughter!

56:08.730 --> 56:15.720
But Sunday morning she would get up in a very
normal way, dress up very well, go to the

56:15.720 --> 56:18.000
church, say her prayers and come back.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.270
I mean, like a possessed person, she used
to walk.

56:21.270 --> 56:25.559
But somehow one of the Sundays she got lost
and she informed the police.

56:25.559 --> 56:30.359
The police said, “You better send her to
one of these places where the old are looked

56:30.359 --> 56:31.359
after."

56:31.359 --> 56:37.049
So this Marie told me that, when they put
her there, she found there are many like this

56:37.049 --> 56:38.790
who get up on Sundays!

56:38.790 --> 56:40.890
There is a church for them.

56:40.890 --> 56:43.790
Also there are dead bodies of these mad women.

56:43.790 --> 56:48.280
They go to this church every Sunday, again
they are mad for the whole week, again on

56:48.280 --> 56:52.640
the Sunday, they get up and go to the church
and come back.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.940
Just imagine!

56:54.940 --> 56:56.359
How can that be God?

56:56.359 --> 56:58.349
You mean these dead spirits are God?

56:58.349 --> 57:02.650
And will He shake you all the time like this,
if God enters into you?

57:02.650 --> 57:05.349
How can it be?

57:05.349 --> 57:06.700
It’s maddening.

57:06.700 --> 57:12.809
Will you become more dignified and beautiful,
or you will become ridiculous?

57:12.809 --> 57:13.950
Just ask a question to yourself?

57:13.950 --> 57:18.380
In the Bible, it is written that everybody
said that these people are possessed, and

57:18.380 --> 57:20.540
they laughed at them, and they said they have
gone mad.

57:20.540 --> 57:23.849
And still it is in the Bible, and people read
it!

57:23.849 --> 57:25.910
“Let us read chapter this…”

57:25.910 --> 57:28.520
Just imagine describing mad people!

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
And that has become ‘authentic’, now who
is going to challenge them?

57:29.520 --> 57:30.559
They’ll kill me if I tell them that, but
it’s a fact.

57:30.559 --> 57:37.980
This is not what is going to happen to you.

57:37.980 --> 57:42.059
What Christ has said [is] “Your hands will
speak."

57:42.059 --> 57:47.950
Even Mohammed Sahib has said more about the
day of resurrection.

57:47.950 --> 57:55.700
He didn’t talk of the day of death first,
of the complete destruction first, he talked

57:55.700 --> 57:57.890
more about the day of resurrection.

57:57.890 --> 57:58.890
Christ also [about] the day of judgement.

57:58.890 --> 58:01.579
They did not talk of the death.

58:01.579 --> 58:08.359
While there are people sitting around and
thinking, “Now when will that day come when

58:08.359 --> 58:10.079
we’ll all be finished?”

58:10.079 --> 58:11.079
Imagine!

58:11.079 --> 58:15.319
We have reached that state of confusion that
we are waiting for a complete destruction,

58:15.319 --> 58:19.109
trying to celebrate it, the way people are
anxious about it.

58:19.109 --> 58:24.750
First of all, you all have to enter into the
Kingdom of God – that’s the place for

58:24.750 --> 58:25.750
you.

58:25.750 --> 58:26.750
That’s the place to enjoy.

58:26.750 --> 58:28.109
That’s the place God has made.

58:28.109 --> 58:36.770
He has not made you a human being to suffer
and suffer and die in suffering, then we have

58:36.770 --> 58:37.970
never understood Him.

58:37.970 --> 58:40.420
He is the Father of compassion.

58:40.420 --> 58:45.510
He is the ocean of love, an ocean of forgiveness.

58:45.510 --> 58:49.530
We have forgotten, what His nature is.

58:49.530 --> 58:53.930
And we really misunderstand that he has made
us to suffer.

58:53.930 --> 58:58.640
This is really absolutely [an] anti-God idea,
I think, and I just can’t understand how

58:58.640 --> 59:00.859
can we really gulp it down.

59:00.859 --> 59:05.079
It’s too much, to believe that God will
make you suffer.

59:05.079 --> 59:07.750
Or [that] Kundalini makes you suffer is another
worse idea.

59:07.750 --> 59:08.970
She is your Mother.

59:08.970 --> 59:10.490
She has been with you.

59:10.490 --> 59:11.710
She has been waiting.

59:11.710 --> 59:13.150
She is your own mother.

59:13.150 --> 59:14.930
Everybody has an individual Mother.

59:14.930 --> 59:23.299
She has been waiting for this day to give
you Realisation, is she going to make you

59:23.299 --> 59:24.299
suffer?

59:24.299 --> 59:25.299
May God bless you all.

59:25.299 --> 59:28.450
I’m very happy to be back, and I hope you’ll
have more people next time and I’ll be able

59:28.450 --> 59:30.210
to come back again.

59:30.210 --> 59:44.260
If you have any problems, any questions, you
may ask me.

59:44.260 --> 59:52.490
Seeker: You said on the radio interview today,
that you were destined to become what you

59:52.490 --> 59:55.150
are today.

59:55.150 --> 59:58.270
Are we also destined?

59:58.270 --> 01:00:00.640
Shri Mataji: You have hit the point.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.020
That’s it!

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.099
Absolutely, that’s it!

01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:07.790
You are all destined to come and get Realisation
— absolutely that’s it!

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:15.680
Otherwise, do you think am I mad to go about?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.840
Have you ever known so many seekers in this
world?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.020
Not only destined, but [with] deliberations.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:31.930
You have deliberately taken birth in those
days to get your Realisation, and to do the

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:38.280
work of God, and to enjoy the bliss of God.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.549
It’s a deliberate action on your part.

01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:44.940
Destination is of course there, but deliberations
are there [too].

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:51.180
You have to be all very special people to
do that, no doubt.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:57.059
That’s a quality, that’s a quality: everybody
doesn’t have that quality.

01:00:57.059 --> 01:01:00.099
That’s a quality of people, and only such
people can stick on.

01:01:00.099 --> 01:01:07.440
I couldn’t tell this to our mayor, that
it’s a quality that is lacking.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.480
It’s a quality.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.050
They just know that — this is the truth.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.569
Seeker: Isn’t possible to abuse the Kundalini?

01:01:14.569 --> 01:01:17.319
Shri Mataji: No, never, never, never, never!

01:01:17.319 --> 01:01:18.319
You cannot, never.

01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:19.319
Seeker: But can you awaken it through the
wrong channel?

01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:20.569
Shri Mataji: You cannot do it.

01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:23.090
You cannot do it.

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:24.569
You just cannot.

01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:25.970
It’s the wisdom.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:31.780
Kundalini is awakened only by the permission
of a Deity which is wisdom.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.450
You can never misuse it.

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:35.829
You can never sell it.

01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:38.119
I’ll give you an example.

01:01:38.119 --> 01:01:45.440
There was a gentleman, an Indian, whom I gave
Realisation in America, who started his own

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440
organisation.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.380
As usual Indians are very good at making money.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.190
Put them anywhere, they’ll make money.

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:55.170
This fellow, first he behaved all right, and
then he started his organisation and all that

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:58.420
and he wrote to me, “I am doing this Sahaja
Yoga, I am doing this, and I’ve got lots

01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.420
of people coming."

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.010
He put a fees and all that.

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:03.270
I didn’t know how he was running it.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:06.859
Of course, you can charge for the food all
right, you can charge for your stay.

01:02:06.859 --> 01:02:11.220
But when he came — the people in Bombay
are very sensitive — they told me, “Mother,

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.220
we are fainting with this man!

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220
What’s the matter with him?

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.400
We are all feeling giddy."

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.150
I said, “Don’t you worry.

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:17.150
I’ll find out."

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.869
When he came, I said, “Can I have a look
at your brochure?”

01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:25.680
In the brochure, he had written, “For vibrations,
ordinary, $125.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:26.830
For special ones $280!”

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:27.830
I said, “Sir why this?”

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.830
He said, “Mother how am I to live?”

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.280
I said, “What were you doing?”

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.820
He said, “I was a teacher."

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:39.550
I said, “You go ahead with your teaching.

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:43.180
How much money did you pay me to get your
vibrations that you put this kind of a thing

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.180
there?”

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.039
He said, “But how am I going to live?”

01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:48.400
And he got into a temper, and he became very
red.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.000
Now, “I can talk to you about it.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.480
You cannot take any money for it."

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.480
So he got very angry.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.440
He said, “I am going to see one Guru."

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.450
I said, “Go and see him!”

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:01.559
This is a guru living in Calicut (Kozhikode).

01:03:01.559 --> 01:03:04.460
Actually I have never met him.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:07.829
But this fellow, when he came back, he telephoned
to me.

01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:09.970
He said, “Mother please forgive me, please
forgive me, please forgive me."

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:10.970
I said, “What happened?”

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:16.280
He telephoned, and on the telephone he said,
“I must tell you all of what happened."

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.280
I said, “What happened?”

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.289
He said, “I went there, and when I reached
the gate, this guru was sitting in a hut,

01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:25.840
and he started throwing stones at me: one
after another, so many stones he threw that

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.789
I just sat down there.

01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:29.589
He said, “What do you mean?

01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:34.080
You have said those things to Mother and you
think I will give you some blessings here?

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.180
These are my blessings, go ahead!”

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:44.850
And poor fellow, he went back: he went and
sat in the station, on the platform.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:49.030
And one of this guru’s persons went and
said that, “What did you say to Mother?

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:53.300
He knows that Mother is there, and how dare
you say something to Mother?”

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.130
He said, “Because I was making money and
she was angry with me, and this."

01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:00.480
He said, “You better go and ask for forgiveness!”

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.119
For three days, he stayed on the platform
and on the fourth day the guru sent for him

01:04:05.119 --> 01:04:06.119
[and] he came.

01:04:06.119 --> 01:04:09.230
And then he said a Sanskrit shloka in my praise
and all that.

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:10.920
He said, “Just go and read it out to Mother,
that’s all."

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:13.960
So he brought that and read it on the phone.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.280
But somehow he could not meet me.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.520
He tried his level best but he just could
not meet me.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.119
And he read that to me.

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:25.710
But when this guru, I told him that, “Why
don’t you go to America, because this year

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:27.220
I won’t be able to go?”

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:30.820
He went to New York, he was there for three
days and he went back.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.809
He said, “They are all mad people!

01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:33.809
They are dollar-mad!

01:04:33.809 --> 01:04:34.809
I can’t stay there.

01:04:34.809 --> 01:04:35.809
They were offering me dollars for everything."

01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:36.809
So he ran back!

01:04:36.809 --> 01:04:37.829
He couldn’t stay there.

01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:39.309
So there are realised-souls.

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:42.910
There are people who know about Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:45.550
But they know that you cannot sell it.

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:51.680
If you try to do anything like that — finished
— you will lose your vibrations immediately.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.640
They are very sensitive, very sensitive.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.170
If you are ignorant, then it’s all right,
they will stay.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.760
But knowingly if you do something, just they’ll
disappear.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.250
And you won’t like it, because when they
are flowing you are enjoying yourself, and

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.200
you just stop [enjoying].

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:21.109
Those who don’t know anything about Kundalini,
they say the Kundalini is in the stomach,

01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:24.049
this, that — they are not authorised people,
they try to play tricks with Kundalini — they

01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:25.089
get into trouble.

01:05:25.089 --> 01:05:30.069
Because it’s not the Kundalini, because
She is the Mother, but the Deity, the Deity

01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:34.410
that is Christ actually in another form called
Ganesha is sitting down there.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:39.119
He hits them hard onto the sympathetic, and
that’s how they get it, all the problems.

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:43.210
Seeker: So how do other gurus raise the Kundalini?

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:46.460
Shri Mataji: That’s what I am going to do.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.289
Once I have done it, then you will do.

01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:51.270
First an enlightened light must enlighten
you.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:54.460
Once you are enlightened, you enlighten other
people.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:06:00.010
Dr Warren: He said, how do other gurus raise
the Kundalini?

01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:03.310
Shri Mataji: Which one?

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:04.410
Which one?

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.609
Let’s have him out.

01:06:06.609 --> 01:06:09.900
I will send half of them to them.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:10.900
Who is the one?

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.349
They just talk.

01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:15.650
Seeker: Swami Muktananda is quite popular.

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.849
Shri Mataji: You think he’s raising Kundalini
or he’s putting bhoots?

01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:20.250
He is putting possessions!

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.220
They just dance, dance, dance.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:25.530
Anybody can dance, what is so great?

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:29.440
Anybody can dance, what is there so great
in dancing?

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.960
Is there?

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.799
But Kundalini you can see with your naked
eyes, the pulsation, the rising and the cool

01:06:35.799 --> 01:06:38.569
breeze coming out of your head.

01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:39.730
That’s what it is.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:41.800
It’s not dancing: even Rajneesh does that!

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800
He even takes out your clothes!

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.800
All right?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:48.599
But this Muktanand is a funny fellow I must
say.

01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:55.049
Horrible fellow he spoils the Kundalini so
badly!

01:06:55.049 --> 01:06:57.160
The other day one fellow came, who was with
him for sixteen years, can you imagine?

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.859
He’s good for nothing now!

01:06:59.859 --> 01:07:02.560
How to give him Realisation?

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.340
He’s spent all his money, everything.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.839
He has become so useless.

01:07:05.839 --> 01:07:09.799
And then he says now, “Now I feel I am mentally
also good for nothing."

01:07:09.799 --> 01:07:14.440
I sent him to Australia, that fellow.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.440
I am sorry!

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.380
I didn’t mean you, I did not mean you.

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.609
I sent him to Australia because he was going
to Australia, I said all right, you go and

01:07:20.609 --> 01:07:21.609
see these people.

01:07:21.609 --> 01:07:23.559
But a headache, I tell you.

01:07:23.559 --> 01:07:26.130
He’s good for nothing, this fellow!

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:29.990
I know his names in his previous lives (Muktanand).

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:31.270
But very difficult.

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:32.270
Horrible!

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:40.210
They
not only want to make money: it’s all right,

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:43.109
there are thugs, there are smugglers, all
right, I don’t mind.

01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:45.290
But they’ll spoil your chances of Realisation.

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:46.960
They are anti-God.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:50.000
That’s the point is!

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.690
The Kundalini just doesn’t rise in people
who go to Muktanand — rather difficult.

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:55.980
Don’t be frightened, if you have been, I’ll
manage it.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:59.260
It can be worked out.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:05.359
But when you will meet somebody Muktanandi,
you will know: you will run away from that

01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:07.200
person then, because the hands break!

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.780
You get tired.

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.750
The Kundalini is tired, poor thing: She hits
her head, this side, that side.

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:22.140
I don’t know what he does: horrible, cruel
man.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:27.600
One better than the other, this Muktanand.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.480
Can’t you see on his face?

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:32.710
What does he talk?

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:33.710
All nonsense!

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.500
Very easy to make out.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:40.230
He puts the Kundalini in such a way that the
Void is completely finished!

01:08:40.230 --> 01:08:45.540
The crossing point, that Void, is so much
obstructed that the Kundalini doesn’t get

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.159
out of that, it just wobbles there only.

01:08:48.159 --> 01:08:53.859
Well, we’ll work it out, all right?

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:56.450
We’ll work it out.

01:08:56.450 --> 01:09:01.890
You are seekers, you are seekers.

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:04.890
You are God’s own people.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.370
And you are to be saved.

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:07.370
So let these horrible people delude you.

01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.370
How long will they go on?

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:10.100
All of them have to perish one by one, you
will see that.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:16.310
The best part of it [is] that all untruth
fails, ultimately.

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:21.630
Seeker: How do you actually tell a true guru?

01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:24.190
Shri Mataji: After Realisation it’s very
easy.

01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:26.190
But you can tell.

01:09:26.190 --> 01:09:29.580
For example, can’t you say who is a sincere
person?

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.020
You can, if you don’t get into the circus.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.510
It’s simple.

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:44.650
But a true guru will not be worried about
your purse, as to how much money you have

01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:45.650
got.

01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:46.650
And he will give you your own powers.

01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:52.190
He’ll not try to show off his own powers,
talk about his own powers, “I am this, I

01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:53.549
am that,” nothing.

01:09:53.549 --> 01:09:57.140
Unless and until the Kundalini is risen and
you have got Self-realisation, nobody will

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.290
give you false certificate that Kundalini
is awakened.

01:10:01.290 --> 01:10:03.360
It has to manifested.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.030
It’s all falsehood: [from] a to z, it is
false.

01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:11.440
Supposing for example that somebody’s Kundalini
doesn’t rise — all right, it does not

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
rise.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.270
My own daughters are not realised-souls, what
can I do about it?

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:18.350
My own daughters are not realised-souls.

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:20.360
But my grandchildren are.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.050
So what can I do?

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.989
I cannot force on them.

01:10:23.989 --> 01:10:28.969
If it is not, it is not.

01:10:28.969 --> 01:10:30.590
You cannot give a false certificate.

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:36.880
It has to happen.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.219
Seeker: Isn’t it hard to combine Christian
and Hindu concepts?

01:10:41.219 --> 01:10:42.239
Shri Mataji: No, no, it is the easiest.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.870
They are just the same, my child.

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:44.989
They are just the same.

01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:47.420
There is no difference at all.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.040
They are all one.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:55.780
Christ has said, “Those who are not against
me are with me."

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.260
Who are they?

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.340
They are all one.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.390
There is no difference at all.

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:03.409
You’ll find it.

01:11:03.409 --> 01:11:09.640
At different stages they came on this Earth
to give us a new dimension, all of them.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:14.530
Like on a tree, we have different flowers
at different times, but they all come from

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:16.320
the same source, don’t they?

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.679
Now they pluck the flower, “This is my flower,”
“This is my flower."

01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:24.239
That’s not, that’s a dead flower.

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:28.810
The same energy produces the same flowers.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:30.500
But they fight.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:38.570
You will be surprised, if I tell you the whole
history of the relationship between them:

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:47.540
between Christ and Krishna, between Mohammed
and Christ, and Krishna, there’s a big relationship.

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:56.130
They are all related to each other, very closely,
which you’ll find out in Kundalini also.

01:11:56.130 --> 01:12:01.520
It’s very interesting how they are related,
now they have played the game.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.210
And they are all settled down within us: all
brothers sisters, husband-wife; all sorts

01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:06.719
of relationship they have.

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:13.489
It’s very interesting to see, but it is
not only a story but you can see it yourself,

01:12:13.489 --> 01:12:17.780
that they are within you.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:25.230
Say for example if I say that Mohammed Sahib
was the same as Nanak, Guru Nanak.

01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:27.690
Imagine the Sikhs are breaking the neck of
Muslims, and Muslims are breaking the heads

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:30.220
of the Sikhs.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:37.170
It’s a big quarrel going on.

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:45.290
But Nanak came after Mohammed, to teach Muslim-Hindu
unity.

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:48.540
Because he was surprised the way Muslims are.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.980
But they are one!

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:56.429
They are one personality, born again and again.

01:12:56.429 --> 01:13:01.350
Moses, Abraham, Socrates: all of them are
the same.

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:08.739
Now if a Muslim is a fanatic, he gets a cancer.

01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:12.370
Normally he should, or he becomes a dry personality.

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:14.660
Imagine Khomeini.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:16.770
They become a dry personality.

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:19.690
They can be very violent people.

01:13:19.690 --> 01:13:21.750
But supposing they get into trouble, like
cancer.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:27.710
I had one Muslim coming from Iran, who was
a fanatic, he got cancer.

01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:31.590
I said, “You think that Mohammed Sahib is
the only person?”

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:32.590
“Yes,” he said.

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:35.060
“But if I say, Guru Nanak was the same."

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:36.219
“I can’t believe it."

01:13:36.219 --> 01:13:37.219
I said, “Then I can’t cure you.

01:13:37.219 --> 01:13:41.360
You have to accept, because Mohammed Sahib
himself is against you, because he came in

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360
ten forms."

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.230
And he wouldn’t accept it.

01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:48.460
But his wife prevailed upon him because he
was very sick.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.810
And he got cured.

01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:53.280
That’s how you have to prove.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.810
Human beings cannot easily understand.

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:59.159
You see, if you are born in a Christian religion,
you become a Christian.

01:13:59.159 --> 01:14:02.230
It’s a horrible thing like that!

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:08.760
You are all human beings, and all this people
have come on this Earth to give you a new

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:09.760
dimension.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.120
Only we don’t understand them.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.780
They never came to make us fanatics.

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:20.290
That at least ,that is too much to see.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:25.410
After Realisation, you will know that they
are all in complete unison, complete concord,

01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:30.390
that’s not possible on human level: absolute
complete concord.

01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:33.870
Yes, it’s a fact!

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:39.460
All right, should we have Realisation now,
let us try.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:46.770
Because I have to go now to London, and tomorrow
is another very heavy day.

01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:52.800
Please put your hands.
