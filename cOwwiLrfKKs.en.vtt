00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.719
We have come to Sahaja Yoga because
we wanted to know the absolute truth,

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:18.391
and this absolute truth has been now
known to you through your vibrations.

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:25.348
You know it through your
vibrations, what is the absolute truth,

00:00:25.428 --> 00:00:34.293
and you should work everything
on that line, that absolute truth,

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:40.231
whatever you feel on your
vibrations you have to follow.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:46.211
Unfortunately, I have seen many people
think that their vibrations are all right,

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:51.506
they are all right and whatever they are
receiving on their vibrations is first class.

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:54.981
Now, how to correct that point is very difficult.

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.989
It comes from ego.

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.935
When you have ego, you can
never find anything wrong with you.

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:04.501
And even if the vibrations
are telling you something,

00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:07.558
it might be somebody else
who is telling you something,

00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:14.261
because you are not there, your ego
is there and your ego is just spoiling you

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:19.164
and teaching you things which normally

00:01:19.244 --> 00:01:26.006
you would see clearly that "I'm doing
something wrong, I should not have done it."

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:32.920
In this process of correction and
improvement, when you indulge

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.183
you should see: "Are you
getting subtler or grosser?"

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.519
That is the best way to judge.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:50.202
Now, I've seen people who go on judging
on small things like vibrations - whether this

00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:57.397
vibration are all right or not in this
tree or on this flowers or on this land,

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:02.577
all kinds of material things
they want to see the vibrations.

00:02:02.657 --> 00:02:05.940
But for what are you seeing the vibration?

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.813
You are seeing vibration
because some sort of material gain.

00:02:10.893 --> 00:02:15.933
You think that if you check the
vibrations and the vibrations are all right,

00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:21.610
then you are quite safe, you will
not loose this, will not loose that.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.488
It's not true.

00:02:23.568 --> 00:02:30.155
Because vibrations are not meant to judge
all these worldly things and worldly matters.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:34.401
It's absolutely cheapening the vibrations.

00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:40.292
You should not cheapen them,
because vibrations can suggest things

00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:44.560
which may be detrimental to your growth very much.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.551
Once, I wanted somebody to go
somewhere, so he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:51.851
I said, "Why?"

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:54.781
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.155
I said, "That's why I asked you to go.

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:04.851
If the vibrations were good,
what was your use going there?

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.280
That's the reason I asked you
to go there so that you could help

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.273
but before that you judged yourself, judged
your vibrations and then you didn't want to go."

00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:20.568
So, what happens, we
want to have a easy, cozy life.

00:03:20.648 --> 00:03:27.826
And all our problems must be solved by Sahaja
Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja Yoga is of no use.

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:31.193
Whatever is our desire must be fulfilled.

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:35.253
So, now the desires are mostly personal.

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:39.334
"My child is not well, so
the child should be all right,

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:43.386
my husband is misbehaving,
the husband should be all right"

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:46.920
or "I have no house, I must get a house."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.625
See how we are moving our mind, is still
on a very consumer society, as they call it.

00:03:54.705 --> 00:04:02.035
We are all the time thinking, "Now I
should have a son, now, instead of a girl"

00:04:02.115 --> 00:04:05.463
and you get a son and then
you blame Sahaja Yoga for that!

00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:10.736
Anything that according to
your desire doesn't work out,

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:13.898
then you think it's Sahaja
Yoga which has done the harm

00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:16.764
and you are suffering because of Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:28.975
Or this faith in Sahaja Yoga gets little moving
or we can say, in a way, it's not that deep.

00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:35.950
But if you are deeply imbedded in
Sahaja Yoga, then what happens?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.241
"What may come, I will be a Sahaja Yogi."

00:04:44.986 --> 00:04:48.941
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:52.725
it's difficult for people to
die also, I must tell you.

00:04:52.805 --> 00:04:55.581
Even if they want to die, they can't die.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.238
It's the Param Chaitanya which decides for you.

00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:02.131
But supposing you take up a position like that,

00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:07.382
still you must know that
that wish may not be fulfilled.

00:05:07.462 --> 00:05:15.819
If that is not fulfilled then you feel
disturbed and you think, "What's wrong?"

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:24.893
But your wish is not the wish of God Almighty.
