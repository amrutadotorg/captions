00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:31.304
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:36.357
I think we have not understood

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.005
the significance of Bhairavnath

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:51.848
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:28.734
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:44.600
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:59.294
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

00:03:05.197 --> 00:03:09.667
For example, people have a hot temper,

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:14.100
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:29.587
And if a person is in a big temper,

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:35.599
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

00:03:35.804 --> 00:03:38.355
to cool him down.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:53.704
He organises everything under his own control

00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:57.198
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

00:03:57.358 --> 00:04:02.224
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

00:04:14.624 --> 00:04:18.696
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:24.877
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:27.642
then somehow or other,

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:30.892
Bhairavnath will organize,

00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:34.169
also with the help of Hanumana,

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:40.569
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.206
So, for example, people who are depressed

00:05:07.366 --> 00:05:10.001
or who become left-sided,

00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:16.127
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

00:05:16.287 --> 00:05:22.487
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

00:05:22.647 --> 00:05:26.606
very much more to come out of it.

00:05:39.012 --> 00:05:46.970
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:54.989
It is very difficult for a person

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:58.874
who is very left-sided,

00:05:59.034 --> 00:06:04.787
who is all the time feeling very sad,

00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:08.223
unhappy and worried,

00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:12.428
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.456
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:30.893
does not enjoy any collectivity,

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:33.546
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:38.774
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:56.506
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.529
is something superior.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:03.993
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

00:07:12.508 --> 00:07:16.709
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:18.856
all the time thinks,

00:07:19.016 --> 00:07:21.613
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:23.863
I'm so depressed," this, that,

00:07:24.023 --> 00:07:27.167
all the time expecting from others something,

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:32.620
also cannot enjoy the collective.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.692
Such a left-sided person will find

00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:59.275
everything is something unhappy.

00:08:07.494 --> 00:08:10.148
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.374
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:17.940
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:28.355
So, we went to have our food

00:08:28.515 --> 00:08:33.461
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:45.285
but then a car came in and we went there.

00:08:49.574 --> 00:08:52.387
Then they said that

00:08:52.547 --> 00:08:55.675
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:59.800
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.921
So this lady started saying,

00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:16.204
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:19.596
and we can't get a seat."

00:09:29.421 --> 00:09:31.499
I said, "This is all fun;

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:34.088
this is not something a problem."

00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:37.817
This 'problema' word should be given up.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:49.287
This is a new word I have learned,

00:09:49.447 --> 00:09:53.796
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:56.220
in our young age.

00:10:06.718 --> 00:10:10.237
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:13.186
to find everything negative

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:19.667
is the way we really spoil our left side.

00:10:28.716 --> 00:10:31.314
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:37.041
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

00:10:46.819 --> 00:10:49.477
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:51.047
everything was fine.

00:10:51.207 --> 00:10:53.471
I said, "See now, you were only counting

00:10:53.631 --> 00:10:57.863
how many negative things there are,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.101
and you were not seeing the fun."

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:16.521
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:19.809
"You take Bhairava's name,

00:11:24.408 --> 00:11:26.396
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:28.283
and right hand on the Mother Earth

00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:32.488
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:42.317
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:45.607
always light in His hand.

00:11:50.593 --> 00:11:54.256
And He runs up and down

00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:01.546
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

00:12:08.737 --> 00:12:13.404
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

00:12:17.382 --> 00:12:21.334
One of the negativities are that,

00:12:21.494 --> 00:12:24.811
"This is mine",

00:12:28.455 --> 00:12:38.177
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.453
So then, you see, once you get attached

00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:48.792
in this manner, what you find,

00:12:48.952 --> 00:12:55.187
that your children also become negative.

00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:08.925
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

00:13:12.278 --> 00:13:17.702
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

00:13:21.062 --> 00:13:23.637
Are you only seeing problema

00:13:23.797 --> 00:13:27.972
or you are seeing some fun in it?

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.943
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:51.369
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

00:13:56.313 --> 00:14:00.884
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

00:14:01.044 --> 00:14:03.116
"Oh, what a day!"

00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:10.041
Nothing can please them.

00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:17.504
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

00:14:17.664 --> 00:14:21.229
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:28.512 --> 00:14:35.080
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:41.233
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

00:14:41.393 --> 00:14:44.591
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

00:14:44.751 --> 00:14:48.907
then how can there be ignorance?

00:14:54.807 --> 00:15:01.251
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

00:15:01.411 --> 00:15:03.688
if you hide, run away,

00:15:03.848 --> 00:15:08.075
you will say that there is negativity.

00:15:15.413 --> 00:15:17.564
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

00:15:17.724 --> 00:15:23.129
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:32.518
So those people who cannot become collective,

00:15:32.678 --> 00:15:38.614
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:53.200
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

00:15:57.952 --> 00:16:02.084
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

00:16:04.497 --> 00:16:10.938
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:19.161
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:21.460
They are drunkards, all drunk,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.466
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

00:16:25.626 --> 00:16:29.691
When will this end?"

00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:41.635
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

00:16:41.795 --> 00:16:46.884
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

00:16:56.986 --> 00:16:58.322
Then the third one says,

00:16:58.482 --> 00:17:02.756
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

00:17:05.286 --> 00:17:12.259
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:22.869
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:32.025
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

00:17:33.562 --> 00:17:36.115
They cannot see fun at all,

00:17:36.183 --> 00:17:39.468
they cannot enjoy at all,

00:17:42.857 --> 00:17:45.311
and they become very,

00:17:45.415 --> 00:17:47.885
sort of think they are very meditative,

00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:51.851
they are some higher people, they are something superior

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:54.981
in negativity.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:12.102
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

00:18:14.905 --> 00:18:20.663
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:28.593
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:34.235
and while going there I met a lady,

00:18:34.395 --> 00:18:37.103
and she was quite all right, I mean,

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.628
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

00:18:39.716 --> 00:18:43.012
so I started talking to her.

00:18:50.695 --> 00:18:52.704
And she started talking very wisely,

00:18:52.864 --> 00:18:55.243
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

00:18:55.403 --> 00:18:58.722
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

00:18:58.882 --> 00:19:00.589
and we should not do this, that..."

00:19:00.749 --> 00:19:04.846
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

00:19:12.457 --> 00:19:15.977
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

00:19:16.022 --> 00:19:19.594
and no one loves her.

00:19:25.657 --> 00:19:29.588
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

00:19:33.232 --> 00:19:37.116
Suddenly the doctor came in

00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:41.127
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

00:19:41.287 --> 00:19:44.473
I said, "What's this?"

00:19:51.109 --> 00:19:53.911
So the doctor sent for people that,

00:19:54.071 --> 00:19:55.620
"Catch hold of this woman!"

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.954
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

00:20:06.366 --> 00:20:09.097
and why are You talking to her?"

00:20:09.779 --> 00:20:15.621
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.505
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

00:20:22.665 --> 00:20:24.723
run away and were playing tricks,

00:20:24.883 --> 00:20:29.452
but you can see that, clearly.

00:20:35.369 --> 00:20:37.949
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

00:20:38.109 --> 00:20:41.999
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

00:20:42.159 --> 00:20:46.677
you see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

00:20:46.837 --> 00:20:48.513
this is this and this is that,"

00:20:48.673 --> 00:20:51.321
and all the time wasting your precious life

00:20:51.481 --> 00:20:56.612
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

00:21:07.508 --> 00:21:09.858
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:13.798
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:21:20.264 --> 00:21:21.955
So, one has to know that

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:26.302
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

00:21:29.666 --> 00:21:33.321
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:40.621
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:50.081
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

00:21:51.606 --> 00:21:56.360
and funny ideas about attachments

00:21:59.802 --> 00:22:03.132
and also the depressiveness.

00:22:04.787 --> 00:22:06.342
So, today we are, I am very happy

00:22:06.502 --> 00:22:10.242
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

00:22:10.402 --> 00:22:15.770
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

00:22:21.658 --> 00:22:25.160
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.429
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

00:22:29.589 --> 00:22:33.613
and goes to the right side.

00:22:40.117 --> 00:22:44.525
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

00:22:44.685 --> 00:22:51.378
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

00:22:58.968 --> 00:23:04.105
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:08.166
which is really Swayambhu.

00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:14.444
And people are more left-sided,

00:23:14.604 --> 00:23:18.170
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

00:23:22.249 --> 00:23:26.134
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

00:23:26.294 --> 00:23:29.001
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

00:23:29.161 --> 00:23:34.546
and put His light there, make a flame.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.378
I mean, the police takes them,

00:23:45.491 --> 00:23:51.870
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

00:23:57.193 --> 00:24:02.259
And they confess what wrong they have done.

00:24:02.419 --> 00:24:12.111
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

00:24:12.218 --> 00:24:15.772
sly things like thieving.

00:24:23.245 --> 00:24:26.307
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:30.700
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

00:24:37.032 --> 00:24:42.110
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:50.658
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

00:24:54.467 --> 00:24:58.579
So, today we are here to worship

00:24:58.739 --> 00:25:01.181
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:05.914
who incarnated on this earth later on,

00:25:13.873 --> 00:25:17.381
ultimately as Mahavira also.

00:25:18.515 --> 00:25:23.273
So, He stands on the gate of hell

00:25:26.218 --> 00:25:30.319
and stops people from falling into hell.

00:25:34.842 --> 00:25:37.241
But if you want to go to hell,

00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:40.529
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

00:25:40.689 --> 00:25:42.236
that I should go to hell,then He says,

00:25:42.396 --> 00:25:46.285
'All right, you can go.'

00:25:52.526 --> 00:25:58.996
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

00:26:02.815 --> 00:26:08.897
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

00:26:09.057 --> 00:26:15.961
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.282
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

00:26:32.442 --> 00:26:37.706
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:54.188
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

00:26:57.221 --> 00:27:04.351
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:16.479
May God bless you all.
