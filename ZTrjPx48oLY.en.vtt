WEBVTT

01:20.600 --> 01:31.304
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

01:32.512 --> 01:36.357
I think we have not understood

01:36.509 --> 01:42.005
the significance of Bhairavnath

01:42.165 --> 01:51.848
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

02:21.898 --> 02:28.734
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

02:34.160 --> 02:44.600
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

02:51.416 --> 02:59.294
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

03:05.197 --> 03:09.667
For example, people have a hot temper,

03:09.827 --> 03:14.100
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

03:22.568 --> 03:29.587
And if a person is in a big temper,

03:29.747 --> 03:35.599
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

03:35.804 --> 03:38.355
to cool him down.

03:46.687 --> 03:53.704
He organises everything under his own control

03:53.864 --> 03:57.198
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

03:57.358 --> 04:02.224
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

04:14.624 --> 04:18.696
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

04:19.399 --> 04:24.877
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

04:25.037 --> 04:27.642
then somehow or other,

04:27.802 --> 04:30.892
Bhairavnath will organize,

04:31.052 --> 04:34.169
also with the help of Hanumana,

04:34.329 --> 04:40.569
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

05:02.120 --> 05:07.206
So, for example, people who are depressed

05:07.366 --> 05:10.001
or who become left-sided,

05:10.161 --> 05:16.127
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

05:16.287 --> 05:22.487
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

05:22.647 --> 05:26.606
very much more to come out of it.

05:39.012 --> 05:46.970
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

05:51.775 --> 05:54.989
It is very difficult for a person

05:55.149 --> 05:58.874
who is very left-sided,

05:59.034 --> 06:04.787
who is all the time feeling very sad,

06:04.947 --> 06:08.223
unhappy and worried,

06:08.383 --> 06:12.428
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

06:24.940 --> 06:28.456
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

06:28.616 --> 06:30.893
does not enjoy any collectivity,

06:31.053 --> 06:33.546
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

06:33.706 --> 06:38.774
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

06:53.276 --> 06:56.506
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

06:56.666 --> 06:58.529
is something superior.

06:58.689 --> 07:03.993
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

07:12.508 --> 07:16.709
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

07:16.869 --> 07:18.856
all the time thinks,

07:19.016 --> 07:21.613
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

07:21.773 --> 07:23.863
I'm so depressed," this, that,

07:24.023 --> 07:27.167
all the time expecting from others something,

07:27.327 --> 07:32.620
also cannot enjoy the collective.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.692
Such a left-sided person will find

07:52.852 --> 07:59.275
everything is something unhappy.

08:07.494 --> 08:10.148
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

08:10.300 --> 08:14.374
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

08:14.534 --> 08:17.940
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

08:25.013 --> 08:28.355
So, we went to have our food

08:28.515 --> 08:33.461
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

08:41.728 --> 08:45.285
but then a car came in and we went there.

08:49.574 --> 08:52.387
Then they said that

08:52.547 --> 08:55.675
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

08:55.835 --> 08:59.800
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

09:09.100 --> 09:10.921
So this lady started saying,

09:11.081 --> 09:16.204
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

09:16.364 --> 09:19.596
and we can't get a seat."

09:29.421 --> 09:31.499
I said, "This is all fun;

09:31.659 --> 09:34.088
this is not something a problem."

09:34.248 --> 09:37.817
This 'problema' word should be given up.

09:46.639 --> 09:49.287
This is a new word I have learned,

09:49.447 --> 09:53.796
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

09:53.956 --> 09:56.220
in our young age.

10:06.718 --> 10:10.237
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

10:10.397 --> 10:13.186
to find everything negative

10:13.346 --> 10:19.667
is the way we really spoil our left side.

10:28.716 --> 10:31.314
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

10:31.474 --> 10:37.041
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

10:46.819 --> 10:49.477
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

10:49.637 --> 10:51.047
everything was fine.

10:51.207 --> 10:53.471
I said, "See now, you were only counting

10:53.631 --> 10:57.863
how many negative things there are,

11:05.400 --> 11:09.101
and you were not seeing the fun."

11:14.603 --> 11:16.521
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

11:16.681 --> 11:19.809
"You take Bhairava's name,

11:24.408 --> 11:26.396
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

11:26.556 --> 11:28.283
and right hand on the Mother Earth

11:28.443 --> 11:32.488
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

11:39.079 --> 11:42.317
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

11:42.477 --> 11:45.607
always light in His hand.

11:50.593 --> 11:54.256
And He runs up and down

11:54.700 --> 12:01.546
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

12:08.737 --> 12:13.404
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

12:17.382 --> 12:21.334
One of the negativities are that,

12:21.494 --> 12:24.811
"This is mine",

12:28.455 --> 12:38.177
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

12:43.120 --> 12:45.453
So then, you see, once you get attached

12:45.613 --> 12:48.792
in this manner, what you find,

12:48.952 --> 12:55.187
that your children also become negative.

13:01.096 --> 13:08.925
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

13:12.278 --> 13:17.702
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

13:21.062 --> 13:23.637
Are you only seeing problema

13:23.797 --> 13:27.972
or you are seeing some fun in it?

13:36.680 --> 13:41.943
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

13:45.095 --> 13:51.369
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

13:56.313 --> 14:00.884
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

14:01.044 --> 14:03.116
"Oh, what a day!"

14:06.995 --> 14:10.041
Nothing can please them.

14:11.302 --> 14:17.504
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

14:17.664 --> 14:21.229
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

14:28.512 --> 14:35.080
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

14:37.645 --> 14:41.233
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

14:41.393 --> 14:44.591
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

14:44.751 --> 14:48.907
then how can there be ignorance?

14:54.807 --> 15:01.251
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

15:01.411 --> 15:03.688
if you hide, run away,

15:03.848 --> 15:08.075
you will say that there is negativity.

15:15.413 --> 15:17.564
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

15:17.724 --> 15:23.129
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

15:28.089 --> 15:32.518
So those people who cannot become collective,

15:32.678 --> 15:38.614
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

15:46.358 --> 15:53.200
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

15:57.952 --> 16:02.084
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

16:04.497 --> 16:10.938
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

16:14.014 --> 16:19.161
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

16:19.321 --> 16:21.460
They are drunkards, all drunk,

16:21.620 --> 16:25.466
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

16:25.626 --> 16:29.691
When will this end?"

16:39.133 --> 16:41.635
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

16:41.795 --> 16:46.884
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

16:56.986 --> 16:58.322
Then the third one says,

16:58.482 --> 17:02.756
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

17:05.286 --> 17:12.259
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

17:16.684 --> 17:22.869
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

17:26.112 --> 17:32.025
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

17:33.562 --> 17:36.115
They cannot see fun at all,

17:36.183 --> 17:39.468
they cannot enjoy at all,

17:42.857 --> 17:45.311
and they become very,

17:45.415 --> 17:47.885
sort of think they are very meditative,

17:48.021 --> 17:51.851
they are some higher people, they are something superior

17:51.837 --> 17:54.981
in negativity.

18:07.003 --> 18:12.102
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

18:14.905 --> 18:20.663
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

18:24.639 --> 18:28.593
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

18:30.939 --> 18:34.235
and while going there I met a lady,

18:34.395 --> 18:37.103
and she was quite all right, I mean,

18:37.200 --> 18:39.628
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

18:39.716 --> 18:43.012
so I started talking to her.

18:50.695 --> 18:52.704
And she started talking very wisely,

18:52.864 --> 18:55.243
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

18:55.403 --> 18:58.722
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

18:58.882 --> 19:00.589
and we should not do this, that..."

19:00.749 --> 19:04.846
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

19:12.457 --> 19:15.977
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

19:16.022 --> 19:19.594
and no one loves her.

19:25.657 --> 19:29.588
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

19:33.232 --> 19:37.116
Suddenly the doctor came in

19:37.549 --> 19:41.127
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

19:41.287 --> 19:44.473
I said,Â "What's this?"

19:51.109 --> 19:53.911
So the doctor sent for people that,

19:54.071 --> 19:55.620
"Catch hold of this woman!"

19:55.780 --> 19:59.954
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

20:06.366 --> 20:09.097
and why are You talking to her?"

20:09.779 --> 20:15.621
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

20:19.810 --> 20:22.505
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

20:22.665 --> 20:24.723
run away and were playing tricks,

20:24.883 --> 20:29.452
but you can see that, clearly.

20:35.369 --> 20:37.949
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

20:38.109 --> 20:41.999
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

20:42.159 --> 20:46.677
you see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

20:46.837 --> 20:48.513
this is this and this is that,"

20:48.673 --> 20:51.321
and all the time wasting your precious life

20:51.481 --> 20:56.612
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

21:07.508 --> 21:09.858
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

21:10.018 --> 21:13.798
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

21:20.264 --> 21:21.955
So, one has to know that

21:22.115 --> 21:26.302
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

21:29.666 --> 21:33.321
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

21:33.481 --> 21:40.621
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

21:46.785 --> 21:50.081
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

21:51.606 --> 21:56.360
and funny ideas about attachments

21:59.802 --> 22:03.132
and also the depressiveness.

22:04.787 --> 22:06.342
So, today we are, I am very happy

22:06.502 --> 22:10.242
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

22:10.402 --> 22:15.770
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

22:21.658 --> 22:25.160
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

22:25.320 --> 22:29.429
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

22:29.589 --> 22:33.613
and goes to the right side.

22:40.117 --> 22:44.525
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

22:44.685 --> 22:51.378
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

22:58.968 --> 23:04.105
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

23:04.265 --> 23:08.166
which is really Swayambhu.

23:11.929 --> 23:14.444
And people are more left-sided,

23:14.604 --> 23:18.170
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

23:22.249 --> 23:26.134
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

23:26.294 --> 23:29.001
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

23:29.161 --> 23:34.546
and put His light there, make a flame.

23:43.470 --> 23:45.378
I mean, the police takes them,

23:45.491 --> 23:51.870
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

23:57.193 --> 24:02.259
And they confess what wrong they have done.

24:02.419 --> 24:12.111
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

24:12.218 --> 24:15.772
sly things like thieving.

24:23.245 --> 24:26.307
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

24:26.467 --> 24:30.700
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

24:37.032 --> 24:42.110
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

24:44.774 --> 24:50.658
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

24:54.467 --> 24:58.579
So, today we are here to worship

24:58.739 --> 25:01.181
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

25:01.341 --> 25:05.914
who incarnated on this earth later on,

25:13.873 --> 25:17.381
ultimately as Mahavira also.

25:18.515 --> 25:23.273
So, He stands on the gate of hell

25:26.218 --> 25:30.319
and stops people from falling into hell.

25:34.842 --> 25:37.241
But if you want to go to hell,

25:37.401 --> 25:40.529
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

25:40.689 --> 25:42.236
that I should go to hell,then He says,

25:42.396 --> 25:46.285
'All right, you can go.'

25:52.526 --> 25:58.996
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

26:02.815 --> 26:08.897
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

26:09.057 --> 26:15.961
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

26:28.410 --> 26:32.282
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

26:32.442 --> 26:37.706
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

26:46.736 --> 26:54.188
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

26:57.221 --> 27:04.351
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

27:12.909 --> 27:16.479
May God bless you all.
