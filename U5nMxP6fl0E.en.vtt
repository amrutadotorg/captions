07:42.621 --> 07:48.771
(I never expected) all of you to be here
present for the puja.

07:52.098 --> 07:57.947
I don't know how you all have managed
to come.

08:16.122 --> 08:22.650
Otherwise, it's a very important day today
for all of us

08:23.561 --> 08:26.496
because you know

08:29.082 --> 08:34.719
how Christ died. He was crucified.

08:35.100 --> 08:40.752
He was put on the cross and then He died.

08:42.876 --> 08:47.843
Wonderful the way He said

08:52.702 --> 08:57.802
about you people.

08:59.235 --> 09:04.629
He asked for forgiveness from God.

09:05.093 --> 09:11.023
What we have to learn from His life is

09:11.474 --> 09:17.110
the way He knew how to forgive all of us.

09:19.504 --> 09:22.675
We have to also forgive people.

09:22.876 --> 09:28.462
That seems to be very difficult for people
to forgive.

09:28.663 --> 09:36.115
And if they are angry, they are angry,

09:36.452 --> 09:43.538
they cannot forgive. Then you are no more
sahaja yogis.

09:43.739 --> 09:50.011
Sahaja yogis must forgive, it's very
important

09:50.642 --> 09:57.620
because that is the power you have got
from Christ: to forgive.

10:01.570 --> 10:10.587
Human beings make mistakes; that is
a part of their life.

10:10.788 --> 10:19.122
But at the same time, as sahaja yogis you
must remember that you have to forgive.

10:19.323 --> 10:25.033
That is much more important than getting
angry.

10:25.605 --> 10:33.369
So to forgive people for doing something
wrong according to you

10:33.570 --> 10:38.902
or according to God, you have to forgive.

10:39.339 --> 10:45.367
And you will be surprised that
the forgiveness

10:45.568 --> 10:52.015
is such a great, satisfying quality.

10:52.730 --> 10:56.318
If you can forgive people,

10:58.222 --> 11:04.640
you will become extremely pure

11:06.467 --> 11:17.348
because the dirt or the anger that is
within us goes out.

11:18.124 --> 11:26.661
So to forgive is the biggest blessings
human beings have.

11:28.734 --> 11:32.154
Even Christ said the same thing

11:32.692 --> 11:36.996
that, "Forgive them because they don't
know what they are doing."

11:37.197 --> 11:42.629
So if Christ had to say, so what about you?

11:42.830 --> 11:50.223
We are ordinary human beings and if we
have done mistakes,

11:51.239 --> 11:56.026
people can get angry and upset with you.

11:56.442 --> 12:01.530
But the best thing for you is to forgive.

12:01.822 --> 12:08.793
Forgive for doing something that should
not have been done.

12:09.162 --> 12:17.635
This was the biggest quality of Christ:
that He knew how to forgive.

12:17.921 --> 12:25.350
And He forgave people who had made
horrible mistakes.

12:25.630 --> 12:33.810
Still He forgave them because He loved
them.

12:34.854 --> 12:41.937
And that is what you should also forgive.

12:42.432 --> 12:49.386
Today is a special day for that -
special day for forgiveness.

12:50.989 --> 12:56.537
And that is why I said, whatever you may
think,

12:56.767 --> 13:06.068
it's very late, but we'll have a meeting
because I didn't want to miss the time.

13:10.408 --> 13:20.126
Forgiveness comes by people who are
very generous, who are good-hearted.

13:22.475 --> 13:29.171
You, everybody makes mistakes and so
we can also make mistakes.

13:29.552 --> 13:34.867
But that means we have a right to forgive

13:35.068 --> 13:40.009
and we have a heart to forgive.

13:40.771 --> 13:44.491
If you don't have, then we are not
sahaja yogis.

13:45.189 --> 13:54.798
We must learn to forgive and forgive
without any remarks behind it.

13:57.432 --> 14:04.820
Today is a very special day because
that's what Christ did.

14:05.089 --> 14:16.735
He was one of the most powerful deities
or gods as we may say, most powerful.

14:16.936 --> 14:27.420
He could do anything; He could punish them,
all of them, for misbehaving.

14:29.170 --> 14:35.508
But what did He say? He said, "I forgive"

14:35.709 --> 14:39.402
and He asked God also to forgive.

14:40.401 --> 14:47.224
So whatever may be your powers,

14:47.425 --> 14:53.075
whatever you might have achieved
in your life,

14:53.313 --> 14:57.485
whatever position you might be occupying,

14:57.686 --> 15:03.794
but you must learn the way to forgive.

15:03.995 --> 15:07.846
Otherwise you are nowhere near Christ.

15:08.047 --> 15:14.003
You must learn to forgive; that's a very
great quality

15:14.204 --> 15:19.756
if you can forgive, all the time forgive.

15:19.957 --> 15:27.681
And that's why today I wanted to meet
you all, so I did.

15:29.178 --> 15:34.377
I wanted to meet you all and tell you

15:34.578 --> 15:42.291
that today is a day to forgive.

15:42.492 --> 15:51.618
That doesn't mean you sit down and think,
oh, how many people you have to forgive.

15:52.953 --> 15:56.261
That would be absurd.

15:58.063 --> 16:02.818
But something that haunts your mind

16:08.338 --> 16:17.650
and you think you all been troubled and you
have been put to trouble.

16:18.095 --> 16:25.775
Then just think that you don't know
how many powers you have

16:25.976 --> 16:32.567
and you can't even forgive. When you have
got all these powers;

16:32.768 --> 16:37.600
the greatest power you have got is
to forgive.

16:38.185 --> 16:43.311
And today is the day for forgiving,

16:43.693 --> 16:50.247
forgiving people whom you think they have
done wrong to you,

16:50.448 --> 16:59.223
or they have been unkind to you. Please
try to remember

17:01.438 --> 17:06.098
how many you are still angry.

17:06.518 --> 17:11.222
Just forgive them. Then you have punished
them.

17:11.423 --> 17:17.866
If you forgive them from your heart,
then you have punished them.

17:18.067 --> 17:25.685
You have given them back, whatever they
wanted, they deserved.

17:25.886 --> 17:33.205
So this is not a very difficult thing,
to forgive,

17:33.406 --> 17:37.461
but people think it's very difficult
to forgive

17:37.662 --> 17:44.212
because they have certain great
understandings about themselves.

17:44.413 --> 17:51.615
And then they think how can they forgive?

17:53.971 --> 18:00.443
I don't know what things upset you,
anything can upset you.

18:00.644 --> 18:08.787
After all, you are all realized souls,
you have got your second birth

18:08.988 --> 18:15.922
and you are special people. So you should
have a special quality.

18:16.123 --> 18:24.450
And the special quality is to forgive,
to forgive.

18:24.651 --> 18:32.917
Not to go on remembering on what things you
should be angry and you should be upset.

18:33.118 --> 18:41.280
But just to remember what things you have
to forgive. Just forgive.

18:41.481 --> 18:44.069
For what?

18:47.306 --> 18:55.243
Is a practical thing, most practical.

18:55.568 --> 19:01.476
Supposing somebody slaps me, alright.

19:02.658 --> 19:08.016
If somebody slaps me, what should I do?

19:08.217 --> 19:13.071
I should slap him back? No.

19:13.272 --> 19:21.371
Then why should I ask him, "Why did you
slap me?" No.

19:22.363 --> 19:28.979
Then I should think he must be stupid fool
to do like that?

19:29.673 --> 19:39.685
Even that won't help. On the contrary,
if you can just forgive,

19:40.193 --> 19:48.620
forgive that person who has done something
wrong...

19:50.942 --> 20:01.706
For you it is important that you must
forgive because has no effect.

20:01.907 --> 20:13.772
Once you forgive, it will have more effect
on you, your goodness, your righteousness.

20:14.415 --> 20:24.479
But I think human beings find it difficult
to forgive normally. Normally.

20:27.311 --> 20:35.100
But you are all realized souls; you are
not only human beings.

20:35.301 --> 20:43.728
That's why I'm requesting you that
remember you have a power to forgive.

20:44.268 --> 20:49.426
To forgive everyone who hurts you,

20:49.669 --> 20:57.573
who tortures you, who troubles you.
How far can he go?

20:57.774 --> 21:07.609
Just think of forgiving him and you'll be
amazed, he will change.

21:08.822 --> 21:16.780
He will change and you will also enjoy
yourself.

21:17.752 --> 21:25.622
It's a difficult thing for people
to understand, but just try.

21:25.823 --> 21:32.011
Just try what I'm saying. If somebody does
any harm to you,

21:32.212 --> 21:37.725
just forgive that person and see
the reaction,

21:37.926 --> 21:44.983
reaction in that person and in yourself.
What happens?

21:45.184 --> 21:53.274
But if you want to carry the burden of his
anger or of stupidity, whatever it is,

21:53.475 --> 22:01.110
then you are unnecessarily loaded
with useless things.

22:01.311 --> 22:10.149
We should not waste our energy
on deciding

22:10.350 --> 22:19.285
what's wrong, what did he do and what you
should do to him, that we should not.

22:19.538 --> 22:29.828
Just leave him alone and you just forgive.
Say that, "I forgive."

22:30.029 --> 22:37.732
Look at Christ. Such a powerful person;
such a powerful god!

22:37.933 --> 22:43.603
And when He was crucified,

22:43.804 --> 22:49.933
how He asked for forgiveness for them.

22:50.242 --> 22:56.525
Why did He do it? Because that has power.

22:58.622 --> 23:05.473
Saying, "I forgive", it's very powerful.

23:06.090 --> 23:12.763
You don't lose your power, but
on the contrary,

23:12.964 --> 23:19.660
you go higher in your power.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.624
You go higher in your personality.

23:25.825 --> 23:31.058
Just forgive. As simple as that.

23:31.259 --> 23:38.419
To say that, "I forgive," just like that.

23:38.662 --> 23:50.538
That's how I do because people have
their own whims

23:50.762 --> 23:58.715
and they do whatever they like, but I don't
get angry on that point.

23:58.969 --> 24:05.443
And I'm not upset on that point,
neither I am concerned.

24:05.644 --> 24:12.161
I just say, "I forgive," that's all.

24:12.362 --> 24:23.085
And you'll be amazed, within myself,
it so helps so much, really very helpful.

24:23.317 --> 24:34.326
So this is a very big quality for which
today is a special day.

24:35.026 --> 24:41.224
On the cross Christ said that, "Oh God,
forgive them because they don't know

24:41.473 --> 24:51.936
what they are doing." On the cross
where He was dying He said this,

24:53.012 --> 24:59.287
and what we have to learn is to forgive,

24:59.488 --> 25:07.902
for our sake, not for others. This
helps us. If we forgive,

25:08.103 --> 25:13.282
this will help us very much within
ourselves.

25:13.483 --> 25:21.245
This is the message for today and
permanently. Permanently.

25:21.771 --> 25:30.189
Always, if you are angry with anyone,
just say, "I forgive."

25:30.390 --> 25:38.367
If you find somebody hurting you
or troubling you or torturing you,

25:38.568 --> 25:46.656
how you will work on it? Just forgive,
just forgive. This is the only way.

25:46.857 --> 25:52.959
Today that's why is very important day
for us and I'm so very happy

25:53.160 --> 25:59.227
there‘s a wonderful site here and
then I can speak to you.

26:00.154 --> 26:02.506
Thank you.
