00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:48.771
(I never expected) all of you to be here
present for the puja.

00:07:52.098 --> 00:07:57.947
I don't know how you all have managed
to come.

00:08:16.122 --> 00:08:22.650
Otherwise, it's a very important day today
for all of us

00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:26.496
because you know

00:08:29.082 --> 00:08:34.719
how Christ died. He was crucified.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.752
He was put on the cross and then He died.

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:47.843
Wonderful the way He said

00:08:52.702 --> 00:08:57.802
about you people.

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:04.629
He asked for forgiveness from God.

00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:11.023
What we have to learn from His life is

00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:17.110
the way He knew how to forgive all of us.

00:09:19.504 --> 00:09:22.675
We have to also forgive people.

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:28.462
That seems to be very difficult for people
to forgive.

00:09:28.663 --> 00:09:36.115
And if they are angry, they are angry,

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:43.538
they cannot forgive. Then you are no more
sahaja yogis.

00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:50.011
Sahaja yogis must forgive, it's very
important

00:09:50.642 --> 00:09:57.620
because that is the power you have got
from Christ: to forgive.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:10.587
Human beings make mistakes; that is
a part of their life.

00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:19.122
But at the same time, as sahaja yogis you
must remember that you have to forgive.

00:10:19.323 --> 00:10:25.033
That is much more important than getting
angry.

00:10:25.605 --> 00:10:33.369
So to forgive people for doing something
wrong according to you

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:38.902
or according to God, you have to forgive.

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:45.367
And you will be surprised that
the forgiveness

00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:52.015
is such a great, satisfying quality.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.318
If you can forgive people,

00:10:58.222 --> 00:11:04.640
you will become extremely pure

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:17.348
because the dirt or the anger that is
within us goes out.

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:26.661
So to forgive is the biggest blessings
human beings have.

00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:32.154
Even Christ said the same thing

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.996
that, "Forgive them because they don't
know what they are doing."

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:42.629
So if Christ had to say, so what about you?

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:50.223
We are ordinary human beings and if we
have done mistakes,

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:56.026
people can get angry and upset with you.

00:11:56.442 --> 00:12:01.530
But the best thing for you is to forgive.

00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:08.793
Forgive for doing something that should
not have been done.

00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:17.635
This was the biggest quality of Christ:
that He knew how to forgive.

00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:25.350
And He forgave people who had made
horrible mistakes.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:33.810
Still He forgave them because He loved
them.

00:12:34.854 --> 00:12:41.937
And that is what you should also forgive.

00:12:42.432 --> 00:12:49.386
Today is a special day for that -
special day for forgiveness.

00:12:50.989 --> 00:12:56.537
And that is why I said, whatever you may
think,

00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:06.068
it's very late, but we'll have a meeting
because I didn't want to miss the time.

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:20.126
Forgiveness comes by people who are
very generous, who are good-hearted.

00:13:22.475 --> 00:13:29.171
You, everybody makes mistakes and so
we can also make mistakes.

00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:34.867
But that means we have a right to forgive

00:13:35.068 --> 00:13:40.009
and we have a heart to forgive.

00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:44.491
If you don't have, then we are not
sahaja yogis.

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:54.798
We must learn to forgive and forgive
without any remarks behind it.

00:13:57.432 --> 00:14:04.820
Today is a very special day because
that's what Christ did.

00:14:05.089 --> 00:14:16.735
He was one of the most powerful deities
or gods as we may say, most powerful.

00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:27.420
He could do anything; He could punish them,
all of them, for misbehaving.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:35.508
But what did He say? He said, "I forgive"

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:39.402
and He asked God also to forgive.

00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:47.224
So whatever may be your powers,

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:53.075
whatever you might have achieved
in your life,

00:14:53.313 --> 00:14:57.485
whatever position you might be occupying,

00:14:57.686 --> 00:15:03.794
but you must learn the way to forgive.

00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:07.846
Otherwise you are nowhere near Christ.

00:15:08.047 --> 00:15:14.003
You must learn to forgive; that's a very
great quality

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:19.756
if you can forgive, all the time forgive.

00:15:19.957 --> 00:15:27.681
And that's why today I wanted to meet
you all, so I did.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:34.377
I wanted to meet you all and tell you

00:15:34.578 --> 00:15:42.291
that today is a day to forgive.

00:15:42.492 --> 00:15:51.618
That doesn't mean you sit down and think,
oh, how many people you have to forgive.

00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:56.261
That would be absurd.

00:15:58.063 --> 00:16:02.818
But something that haunts your mind

00:16:08.338 --> 00:16:17.650
and you think you all been troubled and you
have been put to trouble.

00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:25.775
Then just think that you don't know
how many powers you have

00:16:25.976 --> 00:16:32.567
and you can't even forgive. When you have
got all these powers;

00:16:32.768 --> 00:16:37.600
the greatest power you have got is
to forgive.

00:16:38.185 --> 00:16:43.311
And today is the day for forgiving,

00:16:43.693 --> 00:16:50.247
forgiving people whom you think they have
done wrong to you,

00:16:50.448 --> 00:16:59.223
or they have been unkind to you. Please
try to remember

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:06.098
how many you are still angry.

00:17:06.518 --> 00:17:11.222
Just forgive them. Then you have punished
them.

00:17:11.423 --> 00:17:17.866
If you forgive them from your heart,
then you have punished them.

00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:25.685
You have given them back, whatever they
wanted, they deserved.

00:17:25.886 --> 00:17:33.205
So this is not a very difficult thing,
to forgive,

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:37.461
but people think it's very difficult
to forgive

00:17:37.662 --> 00:17:44.212
because they have certain great
understandings about themselves.

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:51.615
And then they think how can they forgive?

00:17:53.971 --> 00:18:00.443
I don't know what things upset you,
anything can upset you.

00:18:00.644 --> 00:18:08.787
After all, you are all realized souls,
you have got your second birth

00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:15.922
and you are special people. So you should
have a special quality.

00:18:16.123 --> 00:18:24.450
And the special quality is to forgive,
to forgive.

00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:32.917
Not to go on remembering on what things you
should be angry and you should be upset.

00:18:33.118 --> 00:18:41.280
But just to remember what things you have
to forgive. Just forgive.

00:18:41.481 --> 00:18:44.069
For what?

00:18:47.306 --> 00:18:55.243
Is a practical thing, most practical.

00:18:55.568 --> 00:19:01.476
Supposing somebody slaps me, alright.

00:19:02.658 --> 00:19:08.016
If somebody slaps me, what should I do?

00:19:08.217 --> 00:19:13.071
I should slap him back? No.

00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:21.371
Then why should I ask him, "Why did you
slap me?" No.

00:19:22.363 --> 00:19:28.979
Then I should think he must be stupid fool
to do like that?

00:19:29.673 --> 00:19:39.685
Even that won't help. On the contrary,
if you can just forgive,

00:19:40.193 --> 00:19:48.620
forgive that person who has done something
wrong...

00:19:50.942 --> 00:20:01.706
For you it is important that you must
forgive because has no effect.

00:20:01.907 --> 00:20:13.772
Once you forgive, it will have more effect
on you, your goodness, your righteousness.

00:20:14.415 --> 00:20:24.479
But I think human beings find it difficult
to forgive normally. Normally.

00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:35.100
But you are all realized souls; you are
not only human beings.

00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:43.728
That's why I'm requesting you that
remember you have a power to forgive.

00:20:44.268 --> 00:20:49.426
To forgive everyone who hurts you,

00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:57.573
who tortures you, who troubles you.
How far can he go?

00:20:57.774 --> 00:21:07.609
Just think of forgiving him and you'll be
amazed, he will change.

00:21:08.822 --> 00:21:16.780
He will change and you will also enjoy
yourself.

00:21:17.752 --> 00:21:25.622
It's a difficult thing for people
to understand, but just try.

00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:32.011
Just try what I'm saying. If somebody does
any harm to you,

00:21:32.212 --> 00:21:37.725
just forgive that person and see
the reaction,

00:21:37.926 --> 00:21:44.983
reaction in that person and in yourself.
What happens?

00:21:45.184 --> 00:21:53.274
But if you want to carry the burden of his
anger or of stupidity, whatever it is,

00:21:53.475 --> 00:22:01.110
then you are unnecessarily loaded
with useless things.

00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:10.149
We should not waste our energy
on deciding

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:19.285
what's wrong, what did he do and what you
should do to him, that we should not.

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:29.828
Just leave him alone and you just forgive.
Say that, "I forgive."

00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:37.732
Look at Christ. Such a powerful person;
such a powerful god!

00:22:37.933 --> 00:22:43.603
And when He was crucified,

00:22:43.804 --> 00:22:49.933
how He asked for forgiveness for them.

00:22:50.242 --> 00:22:56.525
Why did He do it? Because that has power.

00:22:58.622 --> 00:23:05.473
Saying, "Pa, forgive", it's very powerful.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:12.763
You don't lose your power, but
on the contrary,

00:23:12.964 --> 00:23:19.660
you go higher in your power.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.624
You go higher in your personality.

00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:31.058
Just forgive. As simple as that.

00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:38.419
To say that, "I forgive," just like that.

00:23:38.662 --> 00:23:50.538
That's how I do because people have
their own whims

00:23:50.762 --> 00:23:58.715
and they do whatever they like, but I don't
get angry on that point.

00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:05.443
And I'm not upset on that point,
neither I am concerned.

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:12.161
I just say, "I forgive," that's all.

00:24:12.362 --> 00:24:23.085
And you'll be amazed, within myself,
it so helps so much, really very helpful.

00:24:23.317 --> 00:24:34.326
So this is a very big quality for which
today is a special day.

00:24:35.026 --> 00:24:41.224
On the cross Christ said that, "Oh God,
forgive them because they don't know

00:24:41.473 --> 00:24:51.936
what they are doing." On the cross
where He was dying He said this,

00:24:53.012 --> 00:24:59.287
and what we have to learn is to forgive,

00:24:59.488 --> 00:25:07.902
for our sake, not for others. This
helps us. If we forgive,

00:25:08.103 --> 00:25:13.282
this will help us very much within
ourselves.

00:25:13.483 --> 00:25:21.245
This is the message for today and
permanently. Permanently.

00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:30.189
Always, if you are angry with anyone,
just say, "I forgive."

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:38.367
If you find somebody hurting you
or troubling you or torturing you,

00:25:38.568 --> 00:25:46.656
how you will overcome it? Just forgive,
just forgive. This is the only way.

00:25:46.857 --> 00:25:52.959
Today that's why is very important day
for us and I'm so very happy

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:59.227
there are so wonderful Sahajis here and
then I can speak to you.

00:26:00.154 --> 00:26:02.506
Thank you.
