00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:27.757
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:34.196
When Bala says that I can give you realization
in a split of a second I have to tell you

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:36.466
that it is you who get it.

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:47.227
You are built in that way like a seed; when
you put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts.

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:52.657
Whom will you give the credit -- the seed
or the Mother Earth?

00:02:52.657 --> 00:03:03.966
Without the Mother Earth the seed cannot sprout
and it does not mean that if you put a stone

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.826
in the Mother Earth it will sprout.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:15.317
So the credit is not to anyone but it is a
process which is built within us through ages

00:03:15.317 --> 00:03:17.487
of our seeking.

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:22.276
We have been seekers in previous lives and
before that we have been seeking.

00:03:22.276 --> 00:03:25.076
Even when we were amoeba we were seeking.

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.757
That's how we have become a human being.

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:33.177
And now we have reached a stage where we are
human beings and we are seekers of truth.

00:03:33.177 --> 00:03:41.677
This is the epitome of the highest that any
human being can reach where he is seeking.

00:03:41.677 --> 00:03:50.296
As a human being when we are born we are quite
aware that we are higher than animals, that

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:56.957
we have capacities much more than animals
have.

00:03:56.957 --> 00:04:07.147
We are quite aware of our being as a human
being but this awareness that we have is still

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:12.207
not complete because we are still in confusion.

00:04:12.207 --> 00:04:15.966
We do not know why we are on this earth.

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:19.117
We do not know what we have to achieve.

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:27.557
We do not know what mistakes we are committing
or this is right or that is right.

00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:34.567
A man lands up himself into confusion because
of ignorance.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:40.747
Now this ignorance, as has been described
by all the prophets and saints, is just a

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:46.697
myth, like if you have darkness here that
doesn't mean it exists, but because there

00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:49.147
is no light.

00:04:49.147 --> 00:04:56.367
In the negation of the light gives you the
darkness.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:05:04.127
Where is the light, and how do we awaken it?

00:05:04.127 --> 00:05:12.827
This question has been very much looked into
by thousands and thousands of people earlier

00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:19.967
also, and thousands of years back people have
bothered to find out where is this light and

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:22.637
how do we awaken it.

00:05:22.637 --> 00:05:30.867
Now this light is within us because they found
it, and the method they have said also is

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:34.257
within us because they knew about it.

00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:41.617
But this knowledge was quite a big secret
for many years, thousands of years, and was

00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:47.597
not given to people because people were not
ready to accept it and to take advantage of

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.407
it.

00:05:49.407 --> 00:05:53.587
But we should not say that it was not said.

00:05:53.587 --> 00:06:01.277
It was very clearly said in most of the scriptures
that you are to be born again.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.507
Unless and until you know yourself you cannot
know God.

00:06:04.507 --> 00:06:12.386
First you know yourself and then you will
know God Almighty.

00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:25.626
For example, supposing we are coming to Birmingham
and we do not know the way, and we get lost.

00:06:25.626 --> 00:06:32.017
We can come here, can be brought properly,
but the car that you are driving, you don't

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:34.137
know the car.

00:06:34.137 --> 00:06:36.277
You don't know how to drive.

00:06:36.277 --> 00:06:39.127
You don't know the way.

00:06:39.127 --> 00:06:42.897
Then how are you to reach the right place?

00:06:42.897 --> 00:06:48.867
If everything is missing, how can you say
that you can reach Birmingham without any

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.077
knowledge about it?

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:57.777
In the same way, if you have no knowledge
of yourself itself, how can you know God when

00:06:57.777 --> 00:06:59.287
you have not known yourself?

00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:05.346
It is very logical, and extremely simple logic
should tell you that you do not know about

00:07:05.346 --> 00:07:07.697
yourself.

00:07:07.697 --> 00:07:14.737
People become mad and when they are absolutely
gone cases they end up into lunatic asylum.

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:16.807
But when it starts they do not know.

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:23.167
They get cancer diseases, terminal diseases
of the worst type, and they don't know how

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:24.557
to overcome it.

00:07:24.557 --> 00:07:30.397
Till they have reached their last stage they
do not even feel it.

00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:34.357
Suddenly they discover, "O God, I have this
disease."

00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:39.267
So we do not know even our physical being
that when it is hurt, when it is in danger,

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:43.697
when it is diseased we have no idea.

00:07:43.697 --> 00:07:47.066
We do not know our mental being either.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:51.857
When we are impressed by other people we start
behaving like them.

00:07:51.857 --> 00:07:55.537
When they mesmerize us, we start following
them.

00:07:55.537 --> 00:08:00.797
We are not aware that we have no mind of our
own; we are just following something that

00:08:00.797 --> 00:08:06.827
is very aggressive and that's how we accept
it.

00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:15.667
If you are accepting something about which
you have no idea just because you are impressed

00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:24.126
by somebody's personality or the way he talks
or the way he comes to you, then definitely

00:08:24.126 --> 00:08:26.287
your mind you do not know.

00:08:26.287 --> 00:08:29.797
Like Hitler, he came with funny ideas.

00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:37.677
He told people that, "We are a very great
race and we have a right to kill everyone

00:08:37.677 --> 00:08:40.827
and to put the people in the gas chamber."

00:08:40.827 --> 00:08:45.527
They accepted.

00:08:45.527 --> 00:08:51.126
How can you accept such a mass massacre of
people like that?

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:52.126
But they did accept.

00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:57.317
The reason was they did not know what is their
mind.

00:08:57.317 --> 00:09:00.126
We do not know our emotions also.

00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:01.457
We say, "This is my son.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:03.596
I'll give my life for this son.

00:09:03.596 --> 00:09:05.027
I'll do this for him.

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:06.027
This is my daughter.

00:09:06.027 --> 00:09:08.156
This is my father."

00:09:08.156 --> 00:09:12.707
But when it comes to selfishness everything
drops out.

00:09:12.707 --> 00:09:15.717
So we do not also know our emotions.

00:09:15.717 --> 00:09:18.077
If we had known we would not talk like that.

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:20.927
Every moment we are changing our mood from
this to that.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.607
Sometimes we are happy with that person.

00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:24.307
Then we are very unhappy.

00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:26.287
Then we become enemy of that person.

00:09:26.287 --> 00:09:28.156
We fight for that person first.

00:09:28.156 --> 00:09:33.807
We say, "No, this is my brother," and then
we say, "No, he is my enemy."

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:34.807
Why?

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.157
Because both of them do not know their mind.

00:09:38.157 --> 00:09:49.777
So first we must know ourselves by which we
get the light to know all these things.

00:09:49.777 --> 00:09:50.936
Now what is that self?

00:09:50.936 --> 00:09:55.457
What is that Spirit, that Atma about which
all the great people have talked?

00:09:55.457 --> 00:09:59.677
Where does it reside within us?

00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:04.197
It resides in our heart.

00:10:04.197 --> 00:10:06.827
Now when I say this, you need not accept Me.

00:10:06.827 --> 00:10:10.037
In these modern times nothing should be accepted
blindfolded.

00:10:10.037 --> 00:10:11.927
It's very dangerous.

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:16.017
That's how you have fallen into traps of so
many wrong people.

00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:22.096
When I say that you should only have an open
mind of a scientist, to see whatever Mother

00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:24.066
is saying is true or not.

00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:33.697
Now the time has come that God can be proved
scientifically.

00:10:33.697 --> 00:10:38.567
The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that
there is God.

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:45.927
The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that
there is self, the spirit.

00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:51.806
It can prove all the saints and prophets who
came on this earth told the truth.

00:10:51.806 --> 00:10:58.037
It can prove that whatever is said about the
miracles of God is all true.

00:10:58.037 --> 00:10:59.936
The time is like that.

00:10:59.936 --> 00:11:02.446
Only our mind doesn't go to that side.

00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:04.167
We don't want to know about it.

00:11:04.167 --> 00:11:08.377
We don't want to understand it.

00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:11.266
Now this is a special time which is described.

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:19.337
This is a very, very special time which has
been prophesized by so many.

00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:23.307
Every one of them, those who were great saints,
have.

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:29.366
They have to be great saints or real saints,
as we say Sat-Guru [Hindi word meaning True

00:11:29.366 --> 00:11:30.366
Master].

00:11:30.366 --> 00:11:38.597
Those prophets who were real prophets, they
all have said that the time is going to come

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:41.316
when you are going to be resurrected.

00:11:41.316 --> 00:11:48.467
Mohammed Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak."

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:53.740
Very clearly he has talked about resurrection
throughout, but who is bothered to know that?

00:11:53.740 --> 00:12:00.686
They all only want to talk about the doomsday
so that everybody is frightened.

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:06.636
Another is that we talk of the day when you
are all going to be damned into something

00:12:06.636 --> 00:12:13.496
because you should be all frightened and you
should just go under their clutches and surrender

00:12:13.496 --> 00:12:21.956
yourself so that these people who will be
destroyed first are going to save you.

00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:24.066
People have made money out of God.

00:12:24.066 --> 00:12:25.066
Imagine!

00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:27.866
How can you have an enterprise in the name
of God?

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:30.196
How can you make money in the name of God?

00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:32.917
I mean, how does it go into your logics?

00:12:32.917 --> 00:12:36.477
I can't understand that you can pay money.

00:12:36.477 --> 00:12:40.527
How can you intellectualize God?

00:12:40.527 --> 00:12:45.946
It's amazing the way they are intellectualizing
Christ and believing Paul was nothing but

00:12:45.946 --> 00:12:46.946
an intellectual.

00:12:46.946 --> 00:12:48.046
Why is he there in the Bible?

00:12:48.046 --> 00:12:51.717
I can't understand he should not have been
there.

00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:54.837
That way, we Indians are sensible.

00:12:54.837 --> 00:12:58.706
We had Guru Nanak who wrote Guru Granth Sahab.

00:12:58.706 --> 00:13:02.097
He has taken all the poets who are realized
souls.

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:05.116
Not one is none realized.

00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:11.597
We don't listen to people who are not realized,
who are not of a great evolved state.

00:13:11.597 --> 00:13:16.677
But this Mr Paul has come inside there, and
now he's challenging Christ and his miracles.

00:13:16.677 --> 00:13:17.677
What does he know?

00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:20.527
He is not a realized soul.

00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:23.306
If he's not a realized soul how can he talk
about God?

00:13:23.306 --> 00:13:24.306
He has no business.

00:13:24.306 --> 00:13:25.306
He has no right.

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:30.537
None of these people who authorize themselves,
get elected and selected as big Brahmins and

00:13:30.537 --> 00:13:41.076
big pundits and big bishops and Popes and
others, they are nowhere near God.

00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:43.556
They are not realized people, are they?

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.337
What realization have they got?

00:13:46.337 --> 00:13:50.388
They are just interested in politics, economics
and all nonsense that is not God's job.

00:13:50.388 --> 00:13:58.186
But we get into their traps.

00:13:58.186 --> 00:13:59.186
Be careful.

00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:04.676
You are seekers of truth and not of something
that is ignorance.

00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:09.266
We have had enough of ignorance.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:14.996
Any person who has any power will never succumb
or compromise with untruth.

00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:17.996
That is first sign of a person who is a realized
soul.

00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:23.597
He is not bothered, even if you put him to
jail, you crucify him, poison him, do what

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:25.066
you like.

00:14:25.066 --> 00:14:27.556
And this is what surprises me.

00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:34.147
How do you like such people and adore such
people for compromising and meek and taking

00:14:34.147 --> 00:14:39.196
to all kinds of falsehood?

00:14:39.196 --> 00:14:40.777
Take the case of Christ.

00:14:40.777 --> 00:14:44.047
Did He compromise?

00:14:44.047 --> 00:14:46.236
Did not!

00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:49.097
Any time, He never compromised.

00:14:49.097 --> 00:14:51.206
What I am saying about Paul was said by Kahil
Gibran.

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:57.787
Openly he said it in his book, "The Son of
Man" or something like that, he clearly says,

00:14:57.787 --> 00:14:59.246
"This Paul, a strange man."

00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:00.246
I don't understand.

00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:02.796
He's not a man with a free will.

00:15:02.796 --> 00:15:09.046
It's true anybody who is a realized soul can
see this, and all those who follow him are

00:15:09.046 --> 00:15:12.556
following falsehood and making others follow
him.

00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:14.597
I must tell you God is not an enterprise.

00:15:14.597 --> 00:15:15.717
Remember that.

00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:19.956
If you understand that God doesn't understand
money at all.

00:15:19.956 --> 00:15:21.756
Is your headache.

00:15:21.756 --> 00:15:24.477
You better deal with money, not Him.

00:15:24.477 --> 00:15:29.076
So in Sahaja Yoga people say, "Mother, what
about money?"

00:15:29.076 --> 00:15:31.217
I say, "What money?

00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:34.037
How much money you pay to the Mother Earth
to sprout the seed?

00:15:34.037 --> 00:15:37.027
You pay that much to Me.

00:15:37.027 --> 00:15:43.337
If Mother Earth can take for her love any
money, you can give me some money."

00:15:43.337 --> 00:15:44.566
How can you talk like this?

00:15:44.566 --> 00:15:45.657
This is ridiculous.

00:15:45.657 --> 00:15:48.477
It is ridiculous.

00:15:48.477 --> 00:15:50.366
So there is no money.

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.366
That is nonsense.

00:15:51.366 --> 00:15:52.367
There is no effort, either.

00:15:52.367 --> 00:15:54.557
See what effort do we put in?

00:15:54.557 --> 00:15:59.997
It's a living process and for a living process
what effort are you going to put?

00:15:59.997 --> 00:16:03.046
What effort did we put to become human beings?

00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.046
Nothing!

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:05.046
Effortless!

00:16:05.046 --> 00:16:06.796
Sahaja Samadhi Lago.

00:16:06.796 --> 00:16:10.546
Sahaj is born with you.

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:13.546
Sahaja, born with you.

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:17.746
So what is there for people to put in effort?

00:16:17.746 --> 00:16:20.337
It is He who does all the jobs.

00:16:20.337 --> 00:16:21.576
What work do we do?

00:16:21.576 --> 00:16:22.576
In our ego we think, "I have done this.

00:16:22.576 --> 00:16:23.796
I have done that."

00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:24.796
What?

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:28.126
A tree must have died and you make a platform.

00:16:28.126 --> 00:16:29.126
So what?

00:16:29.126 --> 00:16:30.546
Dead from the dead!

00:16:30.546 --> 00:16:32.587
What else have we done?

00:16:32.587 --> 00:16:33.837
Then you make a chair and sit on the chair.

00:16:33.837 --> 00:16:36.936
You can't sit on the garden, floor.

00:16:36.936 --> 00:16:39.287
The other day somebody was interviewing on
the BBC.

00:16:39.287 --> 00:16:40.287
Poor thing!

00:16:40.287 --> 00:16:44.536
You see, they were trying to arrange a platform
and I sat very comfortably, but he had such

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:46.516
aches and cramp.

00:16:46.516 --> 00:16:51.897
He couldn't even ask me proper questions because
he can't sit on the platform.

00:16:51.897 --> 00:16:58.606
He said, "Mother I have never sat on a platform
all my life," because now he must carry a

00:16:58.606 --> 00:17:03.076
chair with him on his head.

00:17:03.076 --> 00:17:09.186
So one must understand that this dead is going
to make us slaves.

00:17:09.186 --> 00:17:12.686
What we do is to create dead out of dead and
think, "Oh, I have done this.

00:17:12.686 --> 00:17:14.316
We have done that."

00:17:14.316 --> 00:17:17.616
Can you transform a flower into a fruit?

00:17:17.616 --> 00:17:19.106
Can you?

00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:24.066
One flower?

00:17:24.066 --> 00:17:26.766
What can I describe?

00:17:26.766 --> 00:17:28.076
The glory of God!

00:17:28.076 --> 00:17:31.066
There's no words.

00:17:31.066 --> 00:17:38.717
Just think that every human being gets a child
according to the family.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:42.436
Who does that job?

00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:43.436
Imagine!

00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:47.056
Imagine that child has cells developed.

00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:53.616
There's thousands of cells: some for the nose,
some for the eyes, some for the hands.

00:17:53.616 --> 00:17:58.066
How it develops automatically -- Sahaja.

00:17:58.066 --> 00:17:59.516
What do you do?

00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:00.756
Spontaneous!

00:18:00.756 --> 00:18:05.147
Do you give any treatment to the child or
give any suggestions to the child?

00:18:05.147 --> 00:18:10.196
The One who does all these things, how can
you describe His glory?

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:12.417
And you challenge Him.

00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:19.366
Here we are, like Newton has said in a very
humble way, collecting the pebbles on the

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:21.967
shores of knowledge.

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:23.306
That's what we are.

00:18:23.306 --> 00:18:29.136
And so we have to know, only thing that we
can become is a drop in the ocean and become

00:18:29.136 --> 00:18:36.837
the ocean so that all our angularities drop
out.

00:18:36.837 --> 00:18:39.647
This is the only thing we have to achieve.

00:18:39.647 --> 00:18:44.236
But for that also, God has made all arrangements
so sweetly within us.

00:18:44.236 --> 00:18:50.366
He has made us so beautifully; he has created
us so beautifully within ourselves.

00:18:50.366 --> 00:18:56.926
This is the picture of that tree of life which
is still dormant within you, and the Kundalini

00:18:56.926 --> 00:19:02.566
that is the Holy Ghost is described, is in
the triangular bone.

00:19:02.566 --> 00:19:09.986
Now this Kundalini has to rise, just like
a primule in a seed, or you can say the germinating

00:19:09.986 --> 00:19:20.787
power, and she rises through six centers,
comes out of your fontanel bone area and gives

00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:25.547
you the Cool Breeze, from your body, from
your head.

00:19:25.547 --> 00:19:28.537
For that you need not change your dress.

00:19:28.537 --> 00:19:29.957
You need not put up any show.

00:19:29.957 --> 00:19:30.957
Nothing.

00:19:30.957 --> 00:19:33.357
It is something inside that happens.

00:19:33.357 --> 00:19:39.557
Kabira has described, "Shunya shikhar par
anahad baaje."

00:19:39.557 --> 00:19:51.547
On

00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:57.487
the silent apex there is the percussion of
Anahata.

00:19:57.487 --> 00:20:01.207
Anahat is this "lub-dub" of the heart you
feel there.

00:20:01.207 --> 00:20:05.837
And then when it breaks you start getting
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:06.837
If you call it, miracle.

00:20:06.837 --> 00:20:07.837
It is a miracle, but to Me it is not.

00:20:07.837 --> 00:20:08.837
It's all there.

00:20:08.837 --> 00:20:09.837
It is built in.

00:20:09.837 --> 00:20:14.407
There are thousand and one miracles we see
morning till evening.

00:20:14.407 --> 00:20:20.597
We are not surprised and this is also the
great thing that God has done, that you all

00:20:20.597 --> 00:20:22.927
have to get your Self-realization.

00:20:22.927 --> 00:20:24.107
The time has come.

00:20:24.107 --> 00:20:29.867
This is the time of judgment, a special time,
a blossom time when thousands of you have

00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:30.927
to get your realization.

00:20:30.927 --> 00:20:36.667
First of all we have to know that we must
get the light within ourselves.

00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:41.277
Then one can tell you all about the chakras
and the nadis and everything.

00:20:41.277 --> 00:20:45.907
Like the light here has to be put on first,
and then one can tell you about the history

00:20:45.907 --> 00:20:51.107
and how it came and about everything else,
but very easy to get the light.

00:20:51.107 --> 00:20:55.837
Now the other day somebody asked me a question,
"Mother it used to take thousands of years

00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:57.597
for people to get realization.

00:20:57.597 --> 00:21:00.827
They used to be born again and again and all
that."

00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:03.837
I said, "That was all right."

00:21:03.837 --> 00:21:08.747
Because on the tree of life first there were
one or two flowers only, but today you all

00:21:08.747 --> 00:21:10.377
have come through all that.

00:21:10.377 --> 00:21:11.527
Now that background is with you.

00:21:11.527 --> 00:21:16.087
You are just cashing your background with
Me.

00:21:16.087 --> 00:21:20.097
I am just like a banker sitting here.

00:21:20.097 --> 00:21:22.857
But even you feel that you don't have a background.

00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.027
You have it.

00:21:25.027 --> 00:21:29.827
You don't know what background you must have
had that you have become a human being, and

00:21:29.827 --> 00:21:31.357
on top of that you are a seeker.

00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:33.407
You might done some mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:21:33.407 --> 00:21:38.367
After all, human beings are only going to
make mistakes.

00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:40.107
So we are not to feel guilty.

00:21:40.107 --> 00:21:44.737
That is one thing I have to make very humble
request that we are not going to feel guilty

00:21:44.737 --> 00:21:45.737
at all.

00:21:45.737 --> 00:21:49.147
Today, somehow or other, the time has become
very short for Me.

00:21:49.147 --> 00:21:51.377
Your train times have to change.

00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:58.707
You have to go to London tonight, and I will
start the program of giving realization to

00:21:58.707 --> 00:21:59.707
you.

00:21:59.707 --> 00:22:05.447
But there will be some people here who will
look after you, fulfill all your questions

00:22:05.447 --> 00:22:07.577
and do everything.

00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:10.987
They have become experts and sometimes they
are more effective than Me.

00:22:10.987 --> 00:22:23.447
Especially in India you see, and here I find
that somehow I, being a very gentle Mother,

00:22:23.447 --> 00:22:27.137
people do not take things seriously.

00:22:27.137 --> 00:22:35.507
Mother may be gentle but She can be very forceful,
and you all should take your realization because

00:22:35.507 --> 00:22:46.867
the power of love is the highest that suits
you, controls you, makes you a higher personality.

00:22:46.867 --> 00:22:51.207
We have never used the power of love so far.

00:22:51.207 --> 00:22:55.127
We have only used the power of hatred.

00:22:55.127 --> 00:22:59.457
The power of love just flows.

00:22:59.457 --> 00:23:08.267
That is, not to be seen but to be felt as
cool breeze all around, is called as Rutambhara

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:13.197
Pragya -- in Sanskrit language, is called
as the All Pervading Power of God's love.

00:23:13.197 --> 00:23:20.347
Is called as Brahma, is called as so many
Nirakaar sakshat brahma, but all these things

00:23:20.347 --> 00:23:23.617
are to be felt.

00:23:23.617 --> 00:23:30.887
It acts so that you get cured of your troubles.

00:23:30.887 --> 00:23:39.117
It acts so that you are mentally a very happy
and a satisfied person that you rise into

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:40.117
joy.

00:23:40.117 --> 00:23:46.527
It acts through your attention that wherever
you put your attention it cures; it makes

00:23:46.527 --> 00:23:48.827
a person innocent.

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:52.197
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes."

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:53.877
Where are those people?

00:23:53.877 --> 00:23:57.907
Where do we find those people who have no
adulterous eyes?

00:23:57.907 --> 00:23:59.227
But you get purified..

00:23:59.227 --> 00:24:04.687
Your eyes get purified, and you have those
eyes that when you put those eyes on anybody

00:24:04.687 --> 00:24:07.457
he gets his realization.

00:24:07.457 --> 00:24:10.977
That sort of a personality you develop.

00:24:10.977 --> 00:24:14.157
You are so great and glorified by God.

00:24:14.157 --> 00:24:17.847
Just achieve what is inside you.

00:24:17.847 --> 00:24:19.927
Just get it, manifest it.

00:24:19.927 --> 00:24:26.527
But truth has to be manifested on your central
nervous system.

00:24:26.527 --> 00:24:28.857
Not just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:24:28.857 --> 00:24:33.437
No mental projection, but you must feel it
on your central nervous system and you have

00:24:33.437 --> 00:24:38.257
to become your own master.

00:24:38.257 --> 00:24:43.507
That's what when happens then you say you
are a self-realized person.

00:24:43.507 --> 00:24:50.287
It's not that you do all kinds of bad things
and say that, "Oh I am great."

00:24:50.287 --> 00:24:51.387
Not so.

00:24:51.387 --> 00:25:03.397
You really become embodiment of virtue, embodiment
of righteousness and you lose that capacity

00:25:03.397 --> 00:25:05.177
to be tempted by nonsense.

00:25:05.177 --> 00:25:10.977
Nor do you allow any habits to come over you.

00:25:10.977 --> 00:25:16.687
Such a powerful, compassionate personality
you develop and the whole personality beams

00:25:16.687 --> 00:25:19.617
with that and you can see it clearly.

00:25:19.617 --> 00:25:27.517
You don't become a miserable bony structure,
as they put up of Christ, but you really become

00:25:27.517 --> 00:25:32.267
like the one Michelangelo has done -- that
sort of a great personality.

00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:36.417
When they put up such a picture know that
they are miserable creatures themselves.

00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:41.257
Ask them if they can carry the cross themselves
that they can put up such a picture of Christ.

00:25:41.257 --> 00:25:48.287
They have done harm to everyone, not only
to Christ; to all the great prophets when

00:25:48.287 --> 00:25:49.947
they lived and when they died.

00:25:49.947 --> 00:25:55.327
They are still harming them by giving wrong
ideas about them, by making money out of them,

00:25:55.327 --> 00:25:58.607
by spreading hatred out of them.

00:25:58.607 --> 00:26:00.457
Anything extreme is wrong.

00:26:00.457 --> 00:26:03.627
You have to be in the center.

00:26:03.627 --> 00:26:06.967
You have to be moderate and it acts and works
out.

00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:10.167
May God bless you all.

00:26:10.167 --> 00:26:15.877
Today I am sorry I won't allow you to ask
Me questions because there's no time today.

00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:21.407
I'm sorry I didn't have so much time, but
what we can do is to leave someone here for

00:26:21.407 --> 00:26:23.447
you, whom you can ask questions.

00:26:23.447 --> 00:26:25.697
Best is to get your realization.

00:26:25.697 --> 00:26:28.977
That will work it out and let's see how much
time it takes.

00:26:28.977 --> 00:26:35.027
Actually, Kundalini takes split of a second
to rise, split of a second.

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:36.027
But where?

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:39.577
In Indian villages.

00:26:39.577 --> 00:26:41.267
I don't know about Birmingham.

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:44.377
Let us see how it works out.

00:26:44.377 --> 00:26:50.677
But you have many people here who are already
realized souls sitting and it should take

00:26:50.677 --> 00:26:53.377
no time for you to be that.

00:26:53.377 --> 00:26:56.057
But don't start thinking about it.

00:26:56.057 --> 00:26:57.977
It is beyond thought.

00:26:57.977 --> 00:27:04.297
It is in thoughtless awareness you have to
rise but you don't have to fight your thoughts.

00:27:04.297 --> 00:27:06.607
You become thoughtlessly aware.

00:27:06.607 --> 00:27:12.817
You become -- again I say you have to become,
it's not just a mental projection or a certificate,

00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:16.437
"born again", and behaving like a stupid fool.

00:27:16.437 --> 00:27:24.577
Or, "I am such and such guru," wearing his
mala and the guru and the shishas going to

00:27:24.577 --> 00:27:28.727
hell, taking two running jumps that way.

00:27:28.727 --> 00:27:31.117
That's not it.

00:27:31.117 --> 00:27:38.417
It's such a funny sight when you see those
people, the chelas of the gurus the way they

00:27:38.417 --> 00:27:39.417
are.

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:40.417
Just can't believe it.

00:27:40.417 --> 00:27:44.687
The guru has befooled them and they have really
become fools and stupid people.

00:27:44.687 --> 00:27:47.377
So be careful.

00:27:47.377 --> 00:27:49.547
You have to become your own guru.

00:27:49.547 --> 00:27:52.197
I am just your Mother.

00:27:52.197 --> 00:27:54.977
I am here to give you your realization.

00:27:54.977 --> 00:27:59.237
As far as the Mother Earth gives sprouting
to the seed, that's all.

00:27:59.237 --> 00:28:02.097
There's no obligation, nothing of the kind.

00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.097
It's your own.

00:28:03.097 --> 00:28:04.217
You have it and enjoy it.

00:28:04.217 --> 00:28:11.597
Only thing after this, as yoga has one meaning,
the Union with the Divine, and another is

00:28:11.597 --> 00:28:19.697
the deftness, the art of handling this power
of God.

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:23.987
The Divine Power, the Divine Laws, this is
the, another meaning.

00:28:23.987 --> 00:28:25.817
That is in Sanskrit it's Kaushalam.

00:28:25.817 --> 00:28:30.857
It's the deftness, the technique, the technicalities.

00:28:30.857 --> 00:28:38.887
Not of how to handle a car but how to handle
this power, this great power that starts flowing

00:28:38.887 --> 00:28:39.887
through you.

00:28:39.887 --> 00:28:49.877
You become like the flute of Shri Krishna,
egoless, and you enjoy that egoless state.

00:28:49.877 --> 00:28:54.897
That's what you all are for and you should
get it.

00:28:54.897 --> 00:28:59.697
May God bless you.

00:28:59.697 --> 00:29:04.497
Question from a seeker.

00:29:04.497 --> 00:29:15.297
Shri Mataji: Just a minute, I'll tell you
now.

00:29:15.297 --> 00:29:17.297
Sit down, sit down.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:19.567
It's very simple, you see.

00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:23.187
Your question is all right but is not thought
out.

00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:26.687
But you understand how you have not thought
out.

00:29:26.687 --> 00:29:31.817
Now just a minute, now in this light there
is a lamp and a light coming out, all right?

00:29:31.817 --> 00:29:38.247
Now you think about your question again.

00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:39.347
What is it?

00:29:39.347 --> 00:29:41.197
What are you asking me?

00:29:41.197 --> 00:29:42.277
All right!

00:29:42.277 --> 00:29:43.347
All right!

00:29:43.347 --> 00:29:46.047
God is everywhere, all right?

00:29:46.047 --> 00:29:51.747
I can't understand what he is talking about.

00:29:51.747 --> 00:29:57.407
Bala: Mother I don't think this is the time
to discuss...

00:29:57.407 --> 00:29:58.887
Shri Mataji: All right, you can discuss with
him later on.

00:29:58.887 --> 00:30:00.367
All right, we'll give you a full chance.

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:01.367
What is he trying to say?

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:02.367
Just tell me.

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:03.367
One minute.

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:09.107
Bala: He is saying that the Kundalini is wholly
within the body but God is everywhere.

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:13.167
How can you awaken something which is within?

00:30:13.167 --> 00:30:14.997
Shri Mataji: But that I will show you....

00:30:14.997 --> 00:30:16.617
Bala: On the assumption that God is everywhere.

00:30:16.617 --> 00:30:18.997
Shri Mataji: I mean, God is everywhere.

00:30:18.997 --> 00:30:19.997
Now see, it's very simple.

00:30:19.997 --> 00:30:20.997
I'll tell you.

00:30:20.997 --> 00:30:21.997
It's like this.

00:30:21.997 --> 00:30:26.187
There is ether everywhere, all right, but
how is it that only the radio receives the

00:30:26.187 --> 00:30:27.577
programs?

00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:31.167
Why do you have a radio?

00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:32.197
You can receive yourself.

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:34.177
After all, ether is everywhere.

00:30:34.177 --> 00:30:35.497
It's very simple.

00:30:35.497 --> 00:30:37.687
I mean, you have not used your brains at all.

00:30:37.687 --> 00:30:39.807
When asking the questions use your brains.

00:30:39.807 --> 00:30:43.607
Comment from questioner: "Let the people receive
the"....

00:30:43.607 --> 00:30:46.477
Shri Mataji: Now you should not be -- Hello,
sir, you should not be aggressive.

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:47.487
There are many who want it.

00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:48.577
Let it be.

00:30:48.577 --> 00:30:49.907
We are going to give you time.

00:30:49.907 --> 00:30:50.907
I will tell you all about it.

00:30:50.907 --> 00:30:55.957
Why you are for the people?

00:30:55.957 --> 00:30:57.267
Are you representing them?

00:30:57.267 --> 00:30:59.127
How are you talking for people?

00:30:59.127 --> 00:31:01.357
Who wants to hear his lecture?

00:31:01.357 --> 00:31:02.957
Is there anyone?

00:31:02.957 --> 00:31:05.097
No one wants you.

00:31:05.097 --> 00:31:06.697
Please go away.

00:31:06.697 --> 00:31:09.897
Useless man, does nothing for you.

00:31:09.897 --> 00:31:13.097
From where they come, God knows.

00:31:13.097 --> 00:31:15.037
Must be from some guru paid by them.

00:31:15.037 --> 00:31:17.407
That's all, nothing else.

00:31:17.407 --> 00:31:21.487
They earn money and that's how they manage.

00:31:21.487 --> 00:31:25.987
They earn money; good advertisements by some
people put them up.

00:31:25.987 --> 00:31:32.097
Some of them came to kill Me because you see
they are enterprisers.

00:31:32.097 --> 00:31:34.897
So, they think when I say, "You can't give
money," you see.

00:31:34.897 --> 00:31:40.577
In Marathi we say that, or in Hindi we say,
"Pate pe pair aana."

00:31:40.577 --> 00:31:42.867
You see, his earnings are hurt.

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.097
They don't like Me.

00:31:44.097 --> 00:31:46.537
It's all right.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:49.857
I'll have to say what I have to say.

00:31:49.857 --> 00:31:52.397
I am not afraid of them.

00:31:52.397 --> 00:32:00.757
All right, please take out your shoes.

00:32:00.757 --> 00:32:02.857
It's not that only I can raise the Kundalini.

00:32:02.857 --> 00:32:04.667
You see, ego gets challenged by that.

00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:05.947
I don't mean that.

00:32:05.947 --> 00:32:08.397
If you get your realization you can give.

00:32:08.397 --> 00:32:14.647
Actually there's one gentleman in Maharashtra
who has raised the Kundalini of ten thousand

00:32:14.647 --> 00:32:19.197
people, but one light has to enlighten another
light.

00:32:19.197 --> 00:32:20.437
What is wrong in that?

00:32:20.437 --> 00:32:22.847
And then another light can enlighten just
another light.

00:32:22.847 --> 00:32:26.657
But the one that is not enlightened has to
get their light from someone.

00:32:26.657 --> 00:32:28.867
In that their ego is hurt.

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:33.057
They don't mind taking dole from the government
but if somebody tries to raise their Kundalini,

00:32:33.057 --> 00:32:38.087
his ego is hurt.

00:32:38.087 --> 00:32:42.357
Such self-respecting people, I can't understand.

00:32:42.357 --> 00:32:46.467
It's a great blessing that somebody's raising
your Kundalini.

00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:48.807
Where do you get people these days?

00:32:48.807 --> 00:32:51.657
They only want to have all your money, that's
all.

00:32:51.657 --> 00:32:52.827
Who does that?

00:32:52.827 --> 00:32:54.737
Have you met anyone?

00:32:54.737 --> 00:32:57.417
If you have met anyone like Me, please tell
Me.

00:32:57.417 --> 00:33:02.717
I haven't met one.

00:33:02.717 --> 00:33:05.897
It's not that I am something great, but this
is the fact.

00:33:05.897 --> 00:33:14.627
This is the truth that somebody has to do
it without any selfish interest.

00:33:14.627 --> 00:33:16.627
It has to be done.

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:20.897
It's a job of a person who has no selfish
interest.

00:33:20.897 --> 00:33:25.907
It's just the love, the compassion.

00:33:25.907 --> 00:33:27.867
So, how can you challenge that?

00:33:27.867 --> 00:33:28.867
It is there.

00:33:28.867 --> 00:33:30.307
It will act and work out.

00:33:30.307 --> 00:33:33.927
All right, so settle down little bit.

00:33:33.927 --> 00:33:36.667
Don't be upset with this gentleman.

00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:37.777
It's all right.

00:33:37.777 --> 00:33:39.997
They are always there to upset.

00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:41.677
Only one is not to fight.

00:33:41.677 --> 00:33:44.307
Now what you have to do take out your shoes,
simple.

00:33:44.307 --> 00:33:48.477
What I say, you just do it and it will work
out.

00:33:48.477 --> 00:33:49.747
Have faith in yourself.

00:33:49.747 --> 00:33:52.247
First of all, have faith in yourself.

00:33:52.247 --> 00:33:53.507
Forgive yourself.

00:33:53.507 --> 00:33:54.507
Don't feel guilty.

00:33:54.507 --> 00:33:57.277
I have told you before now, "Don't feel guilty.

00:33:57.277 --> 00:33:58.277
Don't feel guilty.

00:33:58.277 --> 00:33:59.277
Don't feel guilty."

00:33:59.277 --> 00:34:02.657
All of you are capable of this Kundalini awakening.

00:34:02.657 --> 00:34:06.477
So, please don't feel guilty.

00:34:06.477 --> 00:34:11.667
Just know that everyone can get realization.

00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:19.467
Everyone can become a guru and everyone can
give realizations to others.

00:34:19.467 --> 00:34:21.527
Is a fact.

00:34:21.527 --> 00:34:23.577
This has happened.

00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:28.856
But if you want to sit on the fence, you go
ahead with it because I have to gain nothing

00:34:28.856 --> 00:34:29.856
out of you.

00:34:29.856 --> 00:34:31.007
Be sure on that.

00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:35.367
You see, it's a subtle type of a ego that
works in people.

00:34:35.367 --> 00:34:37.137
What do you have to give Me?

00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:43.667
Supposing I say I want something, then it's
all right, but there's no shop here.

00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:46.137
It's a temple.

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:54.557
In a temple you have to get something and
you don't go and fight with someone in a temple,

00:34:54.557 --> 00:34:55.967
do you?

00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:57.377
All right!

00:34:57.377 --> 00:34:59.097
So now close your eyes.

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:03.797
Put your hands like this, just like this.

00:35:03.797 --> 00:35:06.356
You don't have to do anything.

00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:07.356
Effortless!

00:35:07.356 --> 00:35:08.437
It's effortless.

00:35:08.437 --> 00:35:10.547
Don't fight your thoughts.

00:35:10.547 --> 00:35:11.547
Don't fight anything.

00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:13.937
Just let your attention be loose.

00:35:13.937 --> 00:35:16.097
Kundalini itself will rise.

00:35:16.097 --> 00:35:17.647
You don't have to do anything.

00:35:17.647 --> 00:35:22.287
Just have faith in yourself, that's all, that
you are going to get it.

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:29.287
Now
one thing you have to do is to remember that

00:35:29.287 --> 00:35:34.377
the left hand is for your desire, desire power,
which they will explain to you later, and

00:35:34.377 --> 00:35:41.897
the right hand is for awakening of the Kundalini
in the way that it goes into action.

00:35:41.897 --> 00:35:48.557
It gives release to your different centers
by which the Kundalini rises easily.

00:35:48.557 --> 00:35:49.797
It's very simple thing.

00:35:49.797 --> 00:36:03.177
So, put your right hand on your heart.

00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:08.877
Put your right hand on your heart.

00:36:08.877 --> 00:36:27.706
Now, as I said, the Spirit resides in your
heart but God Almighty, the seat of God Almighty,

00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:34.586
is on top of your head where you have a very
soft bone in your childhood called Talu.

00:36:34.586 --> 00:36:36.867
He resides there.

00:36:36.867 --> 00:36:42.106
But His reflection, the Spirit, resides in
your heart.

00:36:42.106 --> 00:36:49.907
So here you have to say, or ask Me a question
with full confidence again, not counting your

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:54.566
sins or anything, but knowing that you are
a seeker and you are going to be blessed into

00:36:54.566 --> 00:36:55.677
the Kingdom of God.

00:36:55.677 --> 00:37:01.687
With all that dignity as a question to Me
-- you can call Me Shri Mataji or you can

00:37:01.687 --> 00:37:10.407
call me Mother, whatever you like -- "Mother,
am I the spirit?"

00:37:10.407 --> 00:37:15.426
Three times.

00:37:15.426 --> 00:37:27.966
Three times, ask a question.

00:37:27.966 --> 00:37:31.046
You are the spirit, but you have to just ask
the question.

00:37:31.046 --> 00:37:32.387
There's no harm in asking.

00:37:32.387 --> 00:37:36.587
Please keep your eyes shut because Kundalini
won't rise if you, if you keep your eyes shut.

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:41.357
Please have respect for yourself because you
are the spirit.

00:37:41.357 --> 00:37:45.837
So just ask Me a question, "Mother, am I the
spirit?"

00:37:45.837 --> 00:37:47.736
We all have to become that.

00:37:47.736 --> 00:37:50.377
That is the epitome of our evolution.

00:37:50.377 --> 00:37:57.916
We all have to become the spirit.

00:37:57.916 --> 00:38:05.117
Now second position of the hand should be
on the stomach on the left hand side.

00:38:05.117 --> 00:38:08.567
We work on the left hand side.

00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:15.567
On the upper part of the stomach on the left
hand side you have to say again a question,

00:38:15.567 --> 00:38:19.127
"Mother, am I my own master?

00:38:19.127 --> 00:38:25.827
Am I my own guru," because logically if you
are the spirit you become your own master.

00:38:25.827 --> 00:38:30.567
All these great masters reside within us.

00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:34.597
So they bless you for that.

00:38:34.597 --> 00:38:40.667
Now with full confidence, without feeling
guilty, just ask Me a question, "Mother, am

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:43.987
I my own master?

00:38:43.987 --> 00:38:45.926
Am I my own guru?"

00:38:45.926 --> 00:38:53.506
All the great gurus are there within us.

00:38:53.506 --> 00:39:01.607
This is a very important center.

00:39:01.607 --> 00:39:13.016
Now ask this question three times.

00:39:13.016 --> 00:39:36.067
Now take this right hand down on to the lower
part of the stomach, abdomen, and press it

00:39:36.067 --> 00:39:37.137
hard a little.

00:39:37.137 --> 00:39:43.207
This is a very important Swadhistana chakra
on the left hand side and it is related to

00:39:43.207 --> 00:39:49.647
the second part of yoga that I told you -- the
deftness, the technique of the true knowledge.

00:39:49.647 --> 00:39:54.796
Here I must confess I cannot cross your freedom.

00:39:54.796 --> 00:39:57.897
You are free to choose.

00:39:57.897 --> 00:40:05.016
So you have to ask that you want this true
knowledge and you have to say, "Mother, please

00:40:05.016 --> 00:40:07.587
give me my true knowledge.

00:40:07.587 --> 00:40:09.347
Give me Shuddha Vidya.

00:40:09.347 --> 00:40:13.996
Mother, give me true knowledge.

00:40:13.996 --> 00:40:17.716
Give me absolute knowledge.

00:40:17.716 --> 00:40:20.827
Give me pure knowledge."

00:40:20.827 --> 00:40:27.766
You have to say it six times because this
center has got six petals.

00:40:27.766 --> 00:40:38.137
These are like lotuses and they have six petals.

00:40:38.137 --> 00:40:49.246
In the same way it looks after the aortic
plexus in the gross and it has got six sub-plexuses.

00:40:49.246 --> 00:41:07.057
Now please raise your hand again back to the
same position on the stomach on the left hand

00:41:07.057 --> 00:41:13.827
side, that is the upper portion of the stomach,
upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand

00:41:13.827 --> 00:41:14.827
side, please, again.

00:41:14.827 --> 00:41:20.407
Putting the left hand there where it was.

00:41:20.407 --> 00:41:35.137
Now here again you have to assert because
you have asked for the true knowledge, so

00:41:35.137 --> 00:41:41.597
at this center of the guru there are ten gurus;
there are ten masters.

00:41:41.597 --> 00:41:46.337
Or we can say there are ten valences human
being have got.

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:56.006
So, you put your hand on that center on the
left hand side and you have to ten times assert,

00:41:56.006 --> 00:42:01.407
"Mother, I am my own master.

00:42:01.407 --> 00:42:05.157
Mother, I am my own guru."

00:42:05.157 --> 00:42:06.707
That's what people don't like.

00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:16.377
They want to be subservient of somebody who
is not a realized soul because a realized

00:42:16.377 --> 00:42:26.546
soul never makes you subservient; he makes
you higher and higher.

00:42:26.546 --> 00:42:31.317
"Mother, I am my own guru."

00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:34.307
Say it ten times, please.

00:42:34.307 --> 00:42:36.857
Now please do not feel guilty.

00:42:36.857 --> 00:42:40.246
Even if you have been to wrong gurus, whatever
has happened has happened.

00:42:40.246 --> 00:42:41.387
Forget it.

00:42:41.387 --> 00:42:44.087
Don't blame yourself for that.

00:42:44.087 --> 00:42:48.807
Just say, "Mother, please make me my guru."

00:42:48.807 --> 00:42:55.167
First of all as you have said it, now you
say, "Mother, I am my own guru."

00:42:55.167 --> 00:43:18.107
Say it ten times.

00:43:18.107 --> 00:43:23.307
Now raise your right hand.

00:43:23.307 --> 00:43:24.746
It's like a play, I tell you.

00:43:24.746 --> 00:43:25.746
It's just a leela.

00:43:25.746 --> 00:43:27.367
It works out so well.

00:43:27.367 --> 00:43:30.766
Now put your right hand on the heart again.

00:43:30.766 --> 00:43:43.546
Now you have to assert ten times with full
confidence, "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:43:43.546 --> 00:43:45.467
With full confidence please say.

00:43:45.467 --> 00:43:46.837
Don't you worry.

00:43:46.837 --> 00:43:49.137
Many people think we have to cleanse this,
cleanse that.

00:43:49.137 --> 00:43:51.707
You leave it to Me, all those things.

00:43:51.707 --> 00:43:58.367
You just say whatever I tell you, please,
believing in yourself, "Mother I am the spirit."

00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:03.506
This you have to say twelve times because
this center has got twelve petals.

00:44:03.506 --> 00:44:22.127
This is the heart chakra, is called as the
anahat chakra, twelve times.

00:44:22.127 --> 00:44:40.327
Now raise this hand to the base of your neck
and place it on your shoulder from the front

00:44:40.327 --> 00:44:47.926
side in the corner where the neck and the
shoulder meet.

00:44:47.926 --> 00:44:49.776
Put it tight.

00:44:49.776 --> 00:44:54.726
This is the center gets caught up when you
feel guilty which is very badly caught up

00:44:54.726 --> 00:44:57.256
just now.

00:44:57.256 --> 00:45:01.546
What is there to feel guilty?

00:45:01.546 --> 00:45:08.847
Now take the hand from the front side, from
the front side on the left hand, front side,

00:45:08.847 --> 00:45:12.607
not this way across, front across.

00:45:12.607 --> 00:45:13.786
[Aside: No.

00:45:13.786 --> 00:45:23.307
Left hand towards Me and right hand like this
and hold it tight, yes.

00:45:23.307 --> 00:45:28.887
This gentleman is not knowing, you just - this
hand like this and this hand like that.

00:45:28.887 --> 00:45:30.216
Can you do it, please?

00:45:30.216 --> 00:45:31.496
Left hand towards Me.

00:45:31.496 --> 00:45:35.367
Yes, left hand towards Me like that, left
hand towards Me.

00:45:35.367 --> 00:45:38.006
Yes, correct and right hand here.

00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:40.067
That's good.

00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:44.357
Now this is a very important center what we
call the Vishuddhi chakra on the left hand

00:45:44.357 --> 00:45:45.357
side.

00:45:45.357 --> 00:45:50.526
Those who suffer from this center get all
the diseases like angina and rheumatic heart

00:45:50.526 --> 00:45:57.897
and all those things where there's a slow
movement of the circulation.

00:45:57.897 --> 00:46:05.206
So please say sixteen times, "Mother, I am
not guilty."

00:46:05.206 --> 00:46:12.807
You have to be pleasantly approaching towards
God's Kingdom, isn't it?

00:46:12.807 --> 00:46:14.167
You should be pleasant about it.

00:46:14.167 --> 00:46:22.536
What is there to be so sad or to be so gloomy
about?

00:46:22.536 --> 00:46:26.877
So just say, "Mother, I am not guilty," sixteen
times, and if you still continue with that

00:46:26.877 --> 00:46:34.397
kind of a thing is better that you say hundred
and eight times to punish yourself.

00:46:34.397 --> 00:46:38.187
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty."

00:46:38.187 --> 00:46:42.397
Be pleasant about it.

00:46:42.397 --> 00:46:45.097
There's nothing to be upset about yourself.

00:46:45.097 --> 00:46:48.407
All the time you have condemned yourself for
nothing at all.

00:46:48.407 --> 00:46:56.786
Believe me, you have done nothing wrong that
cannot be forgiven by God because God is the

00:46:56.786 --> 00:46:58.796
ocean of love.

00:46:58.796 --> 00:47:01.726
He is the ocean of compassion.

00:47:01.726 --> 00:47:03.946
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:47:03.946 --> 00:48:11.786
What can you do that it cannot wash away these
little specks?

00:48:11.786 --> 00:48:17.936
Some people say that it is difficult to forgive
but just see what is the logic behind it.

00:48:17.936 --> 00:48:20.137
What do we do when we do not forgive?

00:48:20.137 --> 00:48:22.057
What do we do when we forgive?

00:48:22.057 --> 00:48:23.057
Nothing!

00:48:23.057 --> 00:48:24.057
It's a myth.

00:48:24.057 --> 00:48:25.676
We are just torturing ourselves.

00:48:25.676 --> 00:48:34.746
So just say, "Mother I forgive everyone,"
with your heart in it.

00:48:34.746 --> 00:48:38.406
Please forgive everyone.

00:48:38.406 --> 00:48:46.427
To forgive is Divine, and really, that's a
fact.

00:48:46.427 --> 00:49:01.226
You'll feel much lighter if you forgive.

00:49:01.226 --> 00:49:11.186
Now you have to put your hand on top of your
head for a while, just for a while, pressing

00:49:11.186 --> 00:49:21.587
the palm of your hand on top of the fontanel
area or the soft bone or the talu and press

00:49:21.587 --> 00:49:31.557
it in a clockwise manner and move it so that
your scalp also moves in a clockwise manner.

00:49:31.557 --> 00:49:33.417
Press it hard.

00:49:33.417 --> 00:49:35.726
Seven times you have to press it.

00:49:35.726 --> 00:49:42.307
Before that you just say without feeling guilty
again, without confidence before entering

00:49:42.307 --> 00:49:49.577
into the Kingdom of God that, "Oh God, please
forgive me if I have done any mistakes," but

00:49:49.577 --> 00:49:53.996
don't feel any way guilty about it.

00:49:53.996 --> 00:50:04.196
Just say it three times.

00:50:04.196 --> 00:50:16.877
Now here at the top of the head you have to
cross the gross into the subtle.

00:50:16.877 --> 00:50:19.587
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:50:19.587 --> 00:50:22.347
For that I cannot force you.

00:50:22.347 --> 00:50:23.756
I cannot push you in.

00:50:23.756 --> 00:50:25.177
You have to ask for it.

00:50:25.177 --> 00:50:29.906
So again you have to say, "Mother, I want
my realization.

00:50:29.906 --> 00:50:31.597
Please give me self-realization.

00:50:31.597 --> 00:50:35.206
Mother, please give me Atma Shakshatkaar."

00:50:35.206 --> 00:51:38.046
Just press it hard, seven times.

00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:43.877
Now you can take down your hand.

00:51:43.877 --> 00:51:46.046
Put your left hand on top of your head.

00:51:46.046 --> 00:51:51.016
Pay attention there, about four inches above.

00:51:51.016 --> 00:51:57.097
And now see if there's a cool breeze coming
out.

00:51:57.097 --> 00:52:15.097
Keep your eyes shut.

00:52:15.097 --> 00:52:45.766
[Mother breathes into the microphone] You
start feeling a cool breeze on top of your

00:52:45.766 --> 00:52:47.597
head.

00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:48.986
Just move it up and down.

00:52:48.986 --> 00:52:52.337
Now don't get upset you are not feeling it
-- Vishuddhi.

00:52:52.337 --> 00:52:59.637
If you are feeling any cool breeze, well and
good.

00:52:59.637 --> 00:53:04.147
Even it you are not feeling you should not
worry.

00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:06.197
There might be heat coming out.

00:53:06.197 --> 00:53:09.526
First, there's a lot of heat in the body.

00:53:09.526 --> 00:53:10.526
Let it come out.

00:53:10.526 --> 00:53:11.526
Let the heat come out.

00:53:11.526 --> 00:53:15.766
You can change your hand and see if there
is cool breeze coming in.

00:53:15.766 --> 00:53:22.367
If it is coming you can put down your hand.

00:53:22.367 --> 00:53:24.286
Little higher!

00:53:24.286 --> 00:53:33.867
Move it up and down or move backwards and
forwards.

00:53:33.867 --> 00:53:35.786
All right?

00:53:35.786 --> 00:53:36.786
Good.

00:53:36.786 --> 00:53:42.496
Now put your hands like this.

00:53:42.496 --> 00:53:48.946
Now putting the hands towards Me, you have
to ask Me a question again sixteen times,

00:53:48.946 --> 00:53:53.966
I am sorry, "Mother, am I the part and parcel
of the whole?

00:53:53.966 --> 00:54:00.837
Mother, am I the part and parcel of the whole?"

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:28.137
[Aside: that will work out for Vishuddhi].

00:54:28.137 --> 00:54:37.206
Now I will tell you how to raise your own
Kundalini and keep it there because it has

00:54:37.206 --> 00:54:38.206
stuck.

00:54:38.206 --> 00:54:39.906
I know it has stuck.

00:54:39.906 --> 00:54:40.906
Still you may not feel it.

00:54:40.906 --> 00:54:43.276
Some may feel it.

00:54:43.276 --> 00:54:48.877
There are many Sahaja Yogis here who will
help you how to do it.

00:54:48.877 --> 00:54:54.666
They'll tell you, but there's very simple
which you should follow every day to raise

00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:58.006
your Kundalini and keep it in proper place.

00:54:58.006 --> 00:55:08.276
It's first of all, just hold it.

00:55:08.276 --> 00:55:16.776
You have to put your left hand in front of
your Kundalini, just like this, how to raise

00:55:16.776 --> 00:55:19.317
it.

00:55:19.317 --> 00:55:24.226
That is -- [Aside: should we give them a bandhan
first of all?

00:55:24.226 --> 00:55:25.226
All right!

00:55:25.226 --> 00:55:26.226
Doesn't matter.]

00:55:26.226 --> 00:55:32.157
Now you put your right hand here and go on
moving it just like that.

00:55:32.157 --> 00:55:34.637
Take it on top of your head.

00:55:34.637 --> 00:55:39.067
Push it back your head and make a -- that's
it.

00:55:39.067 --> 00:55:42.397
This is the first way we raise our Kundalini.

00:55:42.397 --> 00:55:45.436
Everybody should try because then they will
say, "We didn't feel it.

00:55:45.436 --> 00:55:46.436
We didn't have."

00:55:46.436 --> 00:55:47.436
It's very simple.

00:55:47.436 --> 00:55:52.057
Now this is what in the Bible they said that
when the Holy Ghost blessed them they started

00:55:52.057 --> 00:55:57.377
speaking in strange languages, means the languages
of the chakras, and they moving their hands

00:55:57.377 --> 00:55:58.417
in a funny manner.

00:55:58.417 --> 00:56:01.107
This is the way because that's how you raise
the Kundalini.

00:56:01.107 --> 00:56:02.957
Even the children were doing.

00:56:02.957 --> 00:56:04.077
I saw them.

00:56:04.077 --> 00:56:08.877
They are -- some of them are born realized
so they themselves were trying all the things,

00:56:08.877 --> 00:56:10.307
so -- but we are grown-ups, you see.

00:56:10.307 --> 00:56:12.087
So we are too much up here.

00:56:12.087 --> 00:56:16.186
Now let us be humbled down and take it.

00:56:16.186 --> 00:56:22.127
This is the first time we push back our head.

00:56:22.127 --> 00:56:23.127
That's one.

00:56:23.127 --> 00:56:24.607
Again second time.

00:56:24.607 --> 00:56:28.077
This is, we are raising our Kundalini.

00:56:28.077 --> 00:56:31.307
You'll see the vibrations will increase.

00:56:31.307 --> 00:56:32.477
Second time.

00:56:32.477 --> 00:56:36.536
Third time, three times we have to give, beautiful.

00:56:36.536 --> 00:56:44.417
Three times we have to give a knot, beautiful,
one, two and three.

00:56:44.417 --> 00:56:46.637
Now see your hands.

00:56:46.637 --> 00:56:48.637
Are they feeling cool breeze?

00:56:48.637 --> 00:56:57.166
In the hands, feeling it, yes.

00:56:57.166 --> 00:57:07.857
[Mother speaks in Hindi] If it is not coming
you should not be dishonest.

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:09.286
You have to get it.

00:57:09.286 --> 00:57:11.107
You should not be dishonest to yourself.

00:57:11.107 --> 00:57:16.706
You should be kind to yourself and as a result
of that sometimes, you know, people think,

00:57:16.706 --> 00:57:18.157
"Oh, I haven't got it.

00:57:18.157 --> 00:57:19.157
So what!"

00:57:19.157 --> 00:57:20.357
It's nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:20.357 --> 00:57:21.357
It's something wrong with you.

00:57:21.357 --> 00:57:25.146
Either you are egoistical or you are conditioned.

00:57:25.146 --> 00:57:33.186
Either you are not well or there's something
going in your minds which is against, or some

00:57:33.186 --> 00:57:35.646
sort of a thing that works out.

00:57:35.646 --> 00:57:38.046
I have seen there was a gentleman who asked
me, "Why I can't get it?"

00:57:38.046 --> 00:57:44.146
He was a very frivolous man and I didn't want
to tell him that, "You are frivolous."

00:57:44.146 --> 00:57:59.756
Another one was thinking no end

00:57:59.756 --> 00:58:01.026
of himself.

00:58:01.026 --> 00:58:13.337
So just see if you are feeling.

00:58:13.337 --> 00:58:19.077
Is it so simple?

00:58:19.077 --> 00:58:27.756
[Mother speaks in Hindi] Taking the name of
Nanaka himself, you see, such a great primordial

00:58:27.756 --> 00:58:29.817
master born on this earth.

00:58:29.817 --> 00:58:34.906
Just taking his name itself, the Kundalini
rises.

00:58:34.906 --> 00:58:46.036
[Mother speaks in Hindi] He was the same as
Mohammed Sahib.

00:58:46.036 --> 00:58:47.196
He was the same as Abraham.

00:58:47.196 --> 00:58:52.796
He was the same as Moses.

00:58:52.796 --> 00:58:57.716
Why are you fighting?

00:58:57.716 --> 00:59:02.127
Just see this.

00:59:02.127 --> 00:59:08.286
All right, I am sorry I have to catch a train
because there is some sort of an emergency

00:59:08.286 --> 00:59:11.736
for Me to go to London but here is Warren.

00:59:11.736 --> 00:59:12.847
He is Dr Warren Reeves.

00:59:12.847 --> 00:59:17.397
I call him Warren because he is like my son,
he -- they are all My children.

00:59:17.397 --> 00:59:20.476
He is here to satisfy your mind.

00:59:20.476 --> 00:59:23.197
If you have any questions you can write to
him.

00:59:23.197 --> 00:59:25.847
If you have not felt the vibrations don't
go away.

00:59:25.847 --> 00:59:26.926
Raise your hands.

00:59:26.926 --> 00:59:32.827
There are at least here thirty to forty Sahaja
Yogis who have been imported.

00:59:32.827 --> 00:59:35.996
Now we have to import people from Birmingham
to London.

00:59:35.996 --> 00:59:38.897
So there are so many have come.

00:59:38.897 --> 00:59:41.607
Please just listen to them.

00:59:41.607 --> 00:59:43.506
You can outbeat them in no time.

00:59:43.506 --> 00:59:51.486
There is nothing to feel bad and this is how
you are going to achieve, that is being prophesized.

00:59:51.486 --> 00:59:55.166
And now you can ask a question, "Is there
God?"

00:59:55.166 --> 00:59:58.506
Ask a question, "Is the God miraculous?

00:59:58.506 --> 01:00:01.567
All the miracles of Christ -- are they correct?"

01:00:01.567 --> 01:00:07.196
Real, ask a question and you'll get the answer
as tremendous vibrations.

01:00:07.196 --> 01:00:11.286
You become a computer which is living computer.

01:00:11.286 --> 01:00:13.677
That's how you can prove everything.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.976
Everything can be proved.

01:00:15.976 --> 01:00:18.486
May God bless you all.

01:00:18.486 --> 01:00:19.486
There are people here.

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:21.627
Dr Warren will tell you about it.

01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:23.486
He is going to stay on.

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:28.067
He has given realization to I don't know how
many thousands people in Australia, but somehow

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:30.496
Australians are very much in the center.

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:33.696
I must say Australians are very different.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:37.397
English now think that they have punished
Australians; so now they are great.

01:00:37.397 --> 01:00:38.426
It's not so.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:42.706
In Australia great saints are born.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:46.377
So in England also but we have to become.

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:47.567
So the becoming is the point.

01:00:47.567 --> 01:00:51.687
We have a very nice center in Birmingham and
I've been coming to this hall I don't know

01:00:51.687 --> 01:00:54.516
how many times, and to Birmingham.

01:00:54.516 --> 01:00:57.946
I hope you people become the tree.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:01.497
Now the seed has sprouted but just don't give
it up.

01:01:01.497 --> 01:01:03.367
Become the tree.

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:09.837
That's very important; otherwise it's just
a waste and is a sin against yourself if you

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:10.837
do that.

01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:13.097
So may God bless you.

01:01:13.097 --> 01:01:15.886
I don't think you have questions.
