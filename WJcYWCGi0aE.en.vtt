00:00.000 --> 00:00.375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

00:00.542 --> 00:04.208
Today we have assembled here

00:06.417 --> 00:09.542
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:14.125 --> 00:19.583
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:26.500 --> 00:33.333
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:35.208 --> 00:37.375
And though’ he is

00:38.625 --> 00:44.709
such a young, little boy,

00:47.709 --> 00:52.291
he can fight the whole world,

00:55.458 --> 01:01.458
he can destroy all the negativity.

01:03.458 --> 01:07.709
That’s the sign of innocence.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.667
There have been stories

01:15.458 --> 01:18.709
that children who have fallen from a very great height

01:20.500 --> 01:23.709
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

01:27.125 --> 01:33.542
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

01:36.417 --> 01:39.542
that it doesn’t harm anyone

01:41.375 --> 01:44.166
who is not to be harmed.

01:47.291 --> 01:50.000
It has all the wisdom of the world,

01:51.208 --> 01:53.583
all the understanding of the world;

01:55.291 --> 02:02.208
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

02:03.417 --> 02:07.083
the world, the whole world –

02:08.208 --> 02:14.083
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

02:14.542 --> 02:17.208
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

02:17.709 --> 02:22.542
but they all stand, stand up against

02:23.250 --> 02:29.208
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

02:33.083 --> 02:37.417
You can see in your own lives

02:38.375 --> 02:43.417
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

02:44.667 --> 02:48.333
all of the them, whatever they are,

02:49.166 --> 02:51.208
whatever they are coming from,

02:51.709 --> 02:54.417
whatever maybe their nationality,

02:55.083 --> 02:59.333
they all jump, all jump to control

03:00.375 --> 03:02.542
and to safeguard that child.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.083
What is it?

03:07.458 --> 03:12.667
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

03:14.583 --> 03:18.250
to protect the innocence?

03:20.625 --> 03:25.166
It’s really a shame,

03:25.709 --> 03:28.083
a great shame for us,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.166
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

03:36.375 --> 03:41.667
Anything else can be tolerated.

03:42.542 --> 03:46.709
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

03:47.709 --> 03:53.417
those who have no malice,

03:55.208 --> 04:02.125
who are living like little children, I should say,

04:04.041 --> 04:06.417
if they are attacked by anyone –

04:10.375 --> 04:14.709
not that the whole world reacts to that –

04:17.417 --> 04:24.291
but everyone of them cannot bear

04:26.125 --> 04:31.500
any innocent person or ‘innocent being’ being harmed.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.709
We don’t realise that within us

04:40.709 --> 04:45.417
there is the ocean of love

04:47.250 --> 04:52.291
and ocean of understanding for children.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.500
Why? Why should it be?

04:56.667 --> 05:01.125
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.709
Especially for innocence?

05:06.667 --> 05:12.208
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

05:13.417 --> 05:15.667
innocent children, there are.

05:16.625 --> 05:21.375
But no-one wants to support them.

05:23.458 --> 05:29.375
No-one thinks that it’s proper to ill-treat children.

05:31.166 --> 05:35.542
And those who have done this have to suffer.

05:36.041 --> 05:39.125
They all suffer as a reaction.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.458
What is it within us

05:42.709 --> 05:46.291
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

05:47.333 --> 05:50.583
against innocence?

05:51.417 --> 05:54.250
For example if there is a regular war,

05:55.208 --> 05:57.250
and if there are people fighting;

05:58.041 --> 06:03.125
in a regular war, they don’t have much sympathy.

06:04.709 --> 06:07.375
In the world also, they say “Alright,

06:08.041 --> 06:11.709
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

06:12.333 --> 06:18.417
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.709
That’s what human beings have.

06:23.458 --> 06:29.375
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

06:31.291 --> 06:35.375
which gives you that feeling,

06:37.083 --> 06:42.041
that capacity, that understanding

06:43.333 --> 06:47.709
that you have to protect innocent,

06:48.709 --> 06:53.333
innocent children, innocent people.

06:54.166 --> 06:59.125
And the whole world can rise against all such people

06:59.375 --> 07:02.458
who are trying to kill the innocent.

07:03.667 --> 07:09.083
There cannot be any doubt.

07:10.208 --> 07:15.417
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

07:16.083 --> 07:18.250
or criticise such a thing,

07:18.667 --> 07:22.458
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

07:25.208 --> 07:32.709
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

07:35.166 --> 07:37.166
and can give up anything,

07:38.375 --> 07:42.125
but they cannot give up the feeling

07:42.709 --> 07:45.000
they have for innocence.

07:46.542 --> 07:50.333
It’s very remarkable. We don’t realise

07:51.083 --> 07:57.083
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

07:57.625 --> 07:59.583
for the innocent.

08:03.458 --> 08:07.500
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

08:08.458 --> 08:14.583
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

08:16.709 --> 08:19.667
That’s the beauty of human beings.

08:20.542 --> 08:24.667
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

08:25.208 --> 08:29.125
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

08:29.667 --> 08:32.667
But when it comes to children,

08:34.417 --> 08:36.542
and to innocent people,

08:37.667 --> 08:43.166
everyone feels his responsibility.

08:46.667 --> 08:50.542
It’s difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

08:52.000 --> 08:59.667
because they have a kind of an understanding

09:02.291 --> 09:05.583
that they are something great,

09:06.500 --> 09:11.500
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

09:12.250 --> 09:16.083
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

09:16.458 --> 09:20.667
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

09:22.083 --> 09:25.083
and they can give explanation for that, doesn’t matter –

09:25.500 --> 09:31.583
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

09:32.500 --> 09:36.375
and they can never be honoured

09:37.125 --> 09:38.583
for the thing they are doing.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.208
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

09:42.542 --> 09:47.375
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.375
You might feel a little bit cheated,

09:50.667 --> 09:53.291
you might feel a little bit dominated,

09:54.583 --> 09:57.208
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

09:57.458 --> 10:01.625
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.625
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.583
They should not feel dejected

10:10.583 --> 10:15.166
if they are being used, insulted,

10:15.542 --> 10:19.458
tortured, dominated, it’s alright.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.375
They should not try to destroy

10:24.625 --> 10:29.417
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

10:31.041 --> 10:35.166
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

10:35.625 --> 10:40.542
that when innocence is challenged,

10:42.250 --> 10:47.375
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

10:49.083 --> 10:55.709
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

10:56.542 --> 11:01.166
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

11:02.000 --> 11:06.583
– have been tortured,have been killed.

11:07.583 --> 11:12.625
At that time, all over the world,

11:14.083 --> 11:17.542
it’s a big support for them.

11:19.041 --> 11:25.125
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

11:26.041 --> 11:30.583
is anxious to look after

11:31.625 --> 11:35.458
those who have done this crime.

11:36.375 --> 11:39.417
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

11:39.709 --> 11:42.500
they may not be belonging to the same country,

11:43.250 --> 11:46.667
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

11:47.458 --> 11:53.417
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

11:54.250 --> 11:59.542
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

12:01.041 --> 12:04.208
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

12:04.417 --> 12:08.041
that ‘you cannot attack innocent people’.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.000
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

12:12.417 --> 12:17.125
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

12:18.458 --> 12:22.083
We should not, in no way punish them.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.667
Our main achievement

12:29.458 --> 12:34.458
should be that loving attention for children.

12:35.208 --> 12:39.500
All over the world, whether he belongs

12:39.709 --> 12:43.333
to your family or to some other family,

12:43.625 --> 12:46.083
or has some sort of

12:50.709 --> 12:55.041
detached attention with you,

12:56.083 --> 13:00.625
still because he’s a child, he’s innocent,

13:01.667 --> 13:07.583
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

13:08.166 --> 13:09.709
will try to protect.

13:12.041 --> 13:18.709
It’s very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

13:19.500 --> 13:26.583
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

13:27.667 --> 13:30.417
Children should never be attacked.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.333
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

13:36.208 --> 13:40.125
But you shouldn’t waste your energy on something

13:40.291 --> 13:45.417
that is extremely inauspicious,

13:46.250 --> 13:52.500
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

13:55.458 --> 14:00.208
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

14:01.250 --> 14:05.667
I have not come across anyone so far who says

14:06.166 --> 14:08.417
that they don’t love children – luckily!

14:09.250 --> 14:14.709
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

14:15.375 --> 14:19.417
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

14:20.583 --> 14:24.333
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.583
You love nature – why?

14:27.041 --> 14:29.291
Because it is innocent.

14:29.709 --> 14:35.500
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

14:36.125 --> 14:39.583
who are Sahaja Yogis.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.667
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

14:48.333 --> 14:52.250
It’s very easy to be clever.

14:54.333 --> 14:58.083
But to be wise, one should understand

14:58.625 --> 15:01.291
the beauty of being innocent.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.583
Possibly one may say “Mother,

15:04.709 --> 15:07.625
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

15:08.625 --> 15:12.375
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.166
They may believe that they have done this,

15:15.291 --> 15:19.083
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.667
It is like a rock.

15:25.041 --> 15:30.500
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

15:30.709 --> 15:35.458
any ocean of anger

15:36.417 --> 15:41.583
or any kind of revenge.

15:43.542 --> 15:48.417
It’s the rock that is being looked after

15:49.250 --> 15:52.542
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.542
I’ve told you before also,

15:57.041 --> 16:01.417
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

16:02.291 --> 16:05.500
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

16:07.125 --> 16:10.709
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

16:12.041 --> 16:15.625
but it does not get,

16:16.375 --> 16:18.458
it cannot get it.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.208
After innocence.

16:26.375 --> 16:32.458
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.542
We play with our innocence very much.

16:40.542 --> 16:45.250
We think that by behaving any way we like,

16:46.083 --> 16:50.625
“It’s alright, after all it’s my own desire, my wish”.

16:51.667 --> 16:57.333
And we’ll go on, we go on all the time

16:58.417 --> 17:02.417
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

17:03.041 --> 17:07.375
or covering our power of innocence.

17:08.250 --> 17:12.125
And we think that we have done a great job,

17:13.041 --> 17:19.291
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

17:21.125 --> 17:25.375
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.542
It is not self-sufficient.

17:29.500 --> 17:35.000
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

17:36.542 --> 17:44.375
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

17:45.333 --> 17:47.625
which is the greatest faith,

17:48.625 --> 17:51.417
the greatest help

17:51.709 --> 17:56.083
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

17:56.458 --> 18:01.208
Those people who do not respect their innocence

18:01.709 --> 18:04.667
because they think it makes you weak,

18:07.041 --> 18:10.083
have not seen the power of innocence –

18:10.667 --> 18:13.333
how it works, how it acts.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.625
From all over the world, it reacts.

18:21.500 --> 18:28.500
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

18:29.291 --> 18:31.333
power of innocence.

18:31.667 --> 18:35.250
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.500
And it acts

18:41.709 --> 18:46.625
as if the whole understanding,

18:49.291 --> 18:55.083
whole working-out of the be-ing

18:56.500 --> 18:59.333
is so beautifully achieved.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.542
Now you see in this world

19:04.250 --> 19:10.250
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

19:12.500 --> 19:17.333
It is respected the high ideals.

19:18.709 --> 19:26.333
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

19:26.625 --> 19:34.250
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

19:34.709 --> 19:37.125
of very good nature’

19:38.083 --> 19:43.500
– all these people may have been harmed

19:44.125 --> 19:46.208
may have been killed –

19:46.458 --> 19:50.333
but because of their innocence they shine,

19:50.583 --> 19:53.250
and shine through ages.

19:54.458 --> 20:00.000
You can see the life of all great men like that;

20:00.542 --> 20:06.166
they are all very simple,

20:08.041 --> 20:13.375
they are not deliberating anything –

20:14.500 --> 20:21.417
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

20:23.542 --> 20:28.667
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

20:29.291 --> 20:33.083
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.083
Have faith in that.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.458
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

20:39.125 --> 20:42.625
and that ‘yourself’ is nothing but innocence.

20:44.125 --> 20:48.083
You may say that ‘innocent people get cheated’.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.291
Nobody can cheat innocence,

20:52.500 --> 20:56.375
because that is something of very eternal value.

20:57.250 --> 21:00.208
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

21:00.542 --> 21:05.166
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

21:06.125 --> 21:09.125
And you will be the most successful person

21:10.375 --> 21:15.291
in life when you are absolutely innocent

21:15.542 --> 21:18.291
and your are looking after your innocence.

21:19.083 --> 21:23.125
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

21:23.375 --> 21:27.083
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

21:27.291 --> 21:31.208
by ill doing, it might be covered for the time being.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.458
But if you can take out the clouds

21:35.125 --> 21:39.417
away from the sky of innocence,

21:39.709 --> 21:43.166
the whole thing becomes so obvious

21:43.375 --> 21:46.291
that you have won the whole world.

21:47.166 --> 21:51.125
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

21:51.500 --> 21:55.041
he was insulted, he was tortured.

21:55.667 --> 21:58.208
Those who did this, where are they?

21:59.375 --> 22:03.291
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.125
Nobody is even bothered about them.

22:06.458 --> 22:10.333
A single one person was so much used

22:10.625 --> 22:12.458
and was so much tortured.

22:12.709 --> 22:18.125
But despite that, what has happened?

22:18.667 --> 22:22.208
He has got the respect from the whole world.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.542
The whole world respects.

22:27.625 --> 22:32.041
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

22:32.417 --> 22:34.667
what has he done …’ Nothing of the kind.

22:36.250 --> 22:41.291
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

22:41.542 --> 22:47.208
the essence of complete innocence.

22:49.125 --> 22:57.083
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

22:58.250 --> 23:04.125
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

23:05.709 --> 23:13.041
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

23:14.125 --> 23:17.208
and we don’t want to even remember that, we don’t want to even

23:17.583 --> 23:20.417
consider that it’s a wrong thing to do,

23:22.125 --> 23:26.458
we do not know what is ahead of us.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.083
What happened to Hitler also?

23:30.083 --> 23:33.208
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

23:33.417 --> 23:37.000
he can manage to kill so many people

23:37.208 --> 23:42.083
and still he will remain a very great personality.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.583
They are stupid not to understand

23:45.208 --> 23:47.583
who are the people really respected.

23:48.417 --> 23:53.625
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

23:54.417 --> 23:57.041
He didn’t understand if you wanted to have

23:57.250 --> 23:59.667
really the power over the world,

24:00.208 --> 24:04.125
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

24:04.333 --> 24:06.709
he should have followed the great people.

24:07.458 --> 24:11.250
And the great people are those who are innocent.

24:12.375 --> 24:17.291
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

24:18.709 --> 24:23.500
I don’t know how to say that this power acts,

24:24.125 --> 24:26.250
because it acts in so many ways.

24:27.041 --> 24:32.625
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

24:33.250 --> 24:38.083
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

24:38.291 --> 24:42.667
simple and wise

24:45.333 --> 24:50.083
is remembered all your life.

24:50.709 --> 24:54.667
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

24:56.250 --> 24:58.417
I used to go to the library

24:59.667 --> 25:04.458
and read about the lives of great men

25:05.250 --> 25:10.542
who have created some great things for us.

25:11.208 --> 25:13.083
So many of them.

25:13.709 --> 25:16.125
And I was so impressed

25:17.083 --> 25:23.458
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

25:25.041 --> 25:28.375
For example Abraham Lincoln

25:29.667 --> 25:33.583
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

25:35.041 --> 25:37.542
was a man tortured by his wife also.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.166
She said “You don’t know, you are very clumsy,

25:41.375 --> 25:47.000
you don’t know how to dress up, you don’t know how to behave”.

25:49.417 --> 25:56.709
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

25:58.208 --> 26:01.291
Ultimately he was also killed.

26:02.166 --> 26:06.709
So one can say, “You see, what’s the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

26:09.375 --> 26:14.583
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

26:16.542 --> 26:19.291
Until today, all over the world,

26:19.542 --> 26:23.250
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.333
They don’t know his wife – maybe.

26:33.166 --> 26:37.000
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

26:38.291 --> 26:42.667
Clumsy man, according to her,

26:44.625 --> 26:48.166
and all sorts of degradation for him.

26:49.375 --> 26:55.000
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

26:56.083 --> 26:59.375
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

27:02.166 --> 27:07.125
Why? ‘Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

27:07.291 --> 27:11.375
that shows that he had no strength to survive’ –

27:12.583 --> 27:15.709
but he survived through ages!

27:18.166 --> 27:22.625
So many years have passed, still he’s surviving.

27:24.417 --> 27:27.208
Take the case of all the great people

27:28.500 --> 27:31.000
who have been innocent;

27:31.583 --> 27:34.041
and that’s why they had ideals.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.291
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

27:38.625 --> 27:42.333
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

27:43.208 --> 27:46.500
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

27:46.667 --> 27:49.125
comes only from your innocence.

27:49.417 --> 27:54.333
That’s the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

27:55.458 --> 27:57.500
how you should exist;

27:58.458 --> 28:01.709
what kind of a life you should lead.

28:02.625 --> 28:09.291
It is not important that you have big authorities,

28:09.500 --> 28:16.250
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.500
There have been so many who came and died.

28:21.083 --> 28:24.083
They had so many people with ambitions

28:25.041 --> 28:30.041
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

28:30.583 --> 28:34.083
Nobody’s bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

28:36.375 --> 28:40.166
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

28:40.333 --> 28:42.166
‘No, no, we don’t want to see this man’.

28:43.250 --> 28:47.083
But if there’s a little boy, innocent child,

28:47.375 --> 28:50.625
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

28:51.625 --> 28:54.125
the whole world admires that child.

28:54.583 --> 28:58.542
And these great men are, really,

28:59.083 --> 29:02.542
they are the symbols of that innocence.

29:03.458 --> 29:09.083
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

29:10.041 --> 29:13.500
Ganesha’s main quality is his wisdom.

29:15.709 --> 29:19.542
He knew what was success, through his,

29:21.625 --> 29:24.458
I should say, innocent qualities.

29:25.333 --> 29:29.000
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

29:29.333 --> 29:31.417
quality of innocence.

29:32.500 --> 29:38.709
It’s very surprising how the quality of innocence

29:39.166 --> 29:43.208
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

29:43.709 --> 29:46.250
who may be very

29:52.625 --> 29:58.709
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

30:00.041 --> 30:02.709
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

30:03.291 --> 30:09.667
they are innocent! That’s were ends all the glory of human beings.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.291
To be innocent –

30:14.208 --> 30:15.333
What’s the matter?

30:21.083 --> 30:25.208
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

30:25.542 --> 30:31.250
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

30:32.375 --> 30:40.250
Firstly, you can see for yourself

30:41.375 --> 30:43.208
how your mind works.

30:47.083 --> 30:51.125
What does it do? How it reacts.

30:52.333 --> 30:56.083
This is what one has to watch,

30:56.417 --> 30:58.667
which I call as ‘introspection’.

31:00.625 --> 31:06.166
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

31:07.041 --> 31:12.667
What does it think is the best?

31:13.583 --> 31:16.375
In that thinking, thought process,

31:17.500 --> 31:25.000
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

31:27.709 --> 31:32.125
The first and the foremost is that

31:33.208 --> 31:36.041
you should know how you react to someone.

31:38.250 --> 31:44.083
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

31:46.333 --> 31:48.709
It is very easy to see yourself,

31:49.250 --> 31:51.375
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

31:52.333 --> 31:56.583
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

31:57.709 --> 32:04.417
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

32:06.458 --> 32:10.625
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

32:12.166 --> 32:14.166
What is your behaviour?

32:15.542 --> 32:20.625
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

32:21.417 --> 32:26.166
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

32:26.417 --> 32:29.000
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

32:29.417 --> 32:31.458
Absolutely stupid.

32:32.166 --> 32:34.250
And when they are doing stupid things,

32:35.375 --> 32:37.291
why should we bother about them?

32:37.625 --> 32:40.417
Why should we waste our energy about them?

32:41.500 --> 32:48.333
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

32:49.375 --> 32:55.000
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

32:55.458 --> 32:58.041
they are treated with contempt.

32:58.417 --> 33:00.709
People don’t even want to take their names,

33:01.667 --> 33:04.333
they don’t want to have their photographs,

33:05.250 --> 33:08.458
they don’t want to have anything to do with them.

33:10.041 --> 33:13.291
At this time, at such a juncture,

33:14.375 --> 33:18.417
what happens is the people who are crooks,

33:19.208 --> 33:26.208
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

33:27.291 --> 33:31.625
they start following them because it suits them better.

33:32.125 --> 33:36.625
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

33:37.625 --> 33:40.375
and that’s how a new group is formed –

33:40.709 --> 33:43.625
which we can call ‘a satanic group’.

33:44.667 --> 33:48.709
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

33:49.125 --> 33:53.041
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

33:54.083 --> 33:55.709
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

33:57.291 --> 34:01.125
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

34:01.667 --> 34:05.041
‘It cannot be killed by any weapon’.

34:06.125 --> 34:11.166
Nainam dahanti pavaka – ‘No fire can burn it’.

34:12.041 --> 34:16.291
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

34:16.667 --> 34:22.208
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

34:22.625 --> 34:25.041
‘Wind cannot also suck it’,

34:25.417 --> 34:30.291
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

34:32.083 --> 34:36.166
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.583
I told you, nature is innocent.

34:39.458 --> 34:43.291
It understands and it acts

34:44.083 --> 34:50.083
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

34:50.625 --> 34:57.667
who is trying to malign

34:58.250 --> 35:01.041
or trouble an innocent person.

35:03.625 --> 35:09.333
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.375
I know sometimes one feels

35:12.625 --> 35:15.041
that you are dominated because of that.

35:16.083 --> 35:21.583
Sometimes one feels sad that  ‘Why you are put to this kind

35:22.083 --> 35:24.125
of a treatment by others’.

35:24.458 --> 35:27.083
All kinds of things come to your mind.

35:27.542 --> 35:30.250
But if you worship your innocence,

35:30.500 --> 35:34.542
then you will be always a happy person,

35:35.375 --> 35:40.041
always a kind person, always be humble person.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.583
So, one has to be careful.

35:44.083 --> 35:45.709
You are your own destroyer!

35:46.375 --> 35:48.542
You are the one who kills, you see

35:49.125 --> 35:50.709
What do you say to it?

35:51.166 --> 35:53.709
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

35:54.125 --> 35:57.458
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.458
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

36:02.166 --> 36:05.041
So, you kill yourself –

36:05.583 --> 36:09.125
through this you can save yourself

36:09.542 --> 36:14.125
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

36:14.458 --> 36:17.333
Have faith in the power of innocence.

36:18.333 --> 36:24.125
What is important is, how you show in your own life

36:24.709 --> 36:29.709
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

36:30.208 --> 36:33.709
and that is what is what, is what I call ‘the love’.

36:35.250 --> 36:38.166
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

36:39.041 --> 36:41.291
you have this attitude towards yourself.

36:42.291 --> 36:45.291
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

36:45.500 --> 36:49.458
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

36:49.667 --> 36:54.417
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

36:54.625 --> 36:56.166
through your character.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.667
It’s such a transparent thing in a human being

37:00.709 --> 37:05.667
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

37:06.166 --> 37:13.125
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

37:13.375 --> 37:18.583
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

37:19.458 --> 37:24.000
and your strength of your innocence.

37:24.458 --> 37:28.709
I’m sorry for today’s programme being so late,

37:29.625 --> 37:32.375
but you know I was ready to come

37:34.000 --> 37:39.542
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.166
Because it came so late,

37:43.667 --> 37:47.125
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

37:47.625 --> 37:52.083
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we’ll stop it.

37:53.041 --> 37:58.291
You must send your applications

37:59.625 --> 38:05.000
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

38:05.291 --> 38:12.208
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

38:13.291 --> 38:15.583
and you cannot increase those!

38:16.709 --> 38:20.166
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

38:20.458 --> 38:25.041
that if you want to settle your marriage,

38:25.583 --> 38:31.709
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

38:32.542 --> 38:35.333
Otherwise I’ll leave it to others to decide.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.667
If you like, it can be done.

38:39.291 --> 38:42.166
So a simple thing is this to understand,

38:42.458 --> 38:45.000
that marriage is a very important thing.

38:46.041 --> 38:48.667
You can create innocent children if you are married.

38:49.709 --> 38:53.709
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

38:55.500 --> 39:00.709
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

39:01.417 --> 39:07.000
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

39:07.458 --> 39:11.500
if you send your applications so late.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.583
It should be within one week’s time,

39:16.250 --> 39:18.375
I hope you’ll understand that.

39:18.625 --> 39:20.000
Thank you very much.
