00:27.959 --> 00:33.999
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:35.500 --> 00:42.333
27th September, 1992

01:06.250 --> 01:11.375
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.750
And when I found that the rain was there

01:18.083 --> 01:21.750
and all kinds of problems,

01:22.166 --> 01:24.625
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

01:25.667 --> 01:28.750
I just consulted the calendar,

01:29.542 --> 01:33.542
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

01:33.917 --> 01:38.792
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

01:39.208 --> 01:40.792
it’s inauspicious.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.583
After five forty-five only

01:48.250 --> 01:50.709
the right thing starts,

01:51.166 --> 01:56.875
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

01:57.417 --> 02:04.291
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.750
after five forty-five.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.917
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

02:10.917 --> 02:14.917
or in Europe after five forty-five.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.792
So it is something one must understand that

02:18.333 --> 02:21.959
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

02:22.250 --> 02:24.000
and it is giving all the suggestions;

02:24.583 --> 02:27.125
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

02:27.125 --> 02:28.834
tithi (auspicious time),

02:28.834 --> 02:30.792
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

02:31.000 --> 02:32.250
in the evening.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.250
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

02:34.250 --> 02:36.291
and there it was.

02:36.959 --> 02:39.417
There’s so many things we have to see,

02:40.999 --> 02:47.208
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

02:47.999 --> 02:50.999
For example, I had said long time back

02:51.792 --> 02:56.458
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

02:56.792 --> 02:58.417
carbon atom,

02:59.083 --> 03:06.667
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

03:07.208 --> 03:13.250
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.999
So, now you see from left to the right,

03:18.542 --> 03:21.375
then you see Omkara;

03:21.750 --> 03:24.667
and once you see from down below upward,

03:25.625 --> 03:30.166
you see the alpha and omega.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.000
Now see, Christ has said that

03:33.417 --> 03:38.208
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

03:38.542 --> 03:42.083
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

03:42.458 --> 03:47.250
also becomes Christ.

03:48.917 --> 03:50.125
You can see it very clearly.

03:50.375 --> 03:54.875
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

03:55.500 --> 03:58.375
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

03:58.709 --> 04:00.959
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

04:00.959 --> 04:04.417
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

04:04.667 --> 04:10.166
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

04:11.166 --> 04:14.458
have come to us from

04:17.000 --> 04:20.250
inside, from the Divine.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.583
This is not we have created.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.041
This was found out by some mathematicians

04:29.458 --> 04:31.458
who were realized souls,

04:31.917 --> 04:35.500
and they used this alpha and omega.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.834
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

04:40.166 --> 04:42.208
swastika becoming Omkar,

04:42.500 --> 04:47.208
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

04:47.625 --> 04:53.458
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

04:53.792 --> 04:56.333
can be verified.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.500
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

05:04.000 --> 05:08.166
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

05:09.041 --> 05:13.959
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

05:15.000 --> 05:19.625
She fought all the people who were destroying

05:20.250 --> 05:22.625
the seekers,

05:22.959 --> 05:28.458
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

05:29.291 --> 05:34.792
And these tortured saints,

05:35.250 --> 05:38.583
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

05:38.999 --> 05:46.625
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

05:46.917 --> 05:49.458
with what the Goddess is doing –

05:49.834 --> 05:52.875
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

05:53.417 --> 05:57.542
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

05:57.875 --> 06:01.959
according to the need of the time.

06:03.208 --> 06:06.291
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

06:06.625 --> 06:09.917
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

06:10.417 --> 06:13.792
thinking no end of themselves;

06:14.250 --> 06:19.375
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

06:19.917 --> 06:23.208
horrible rakshasas.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.834
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

06:26.834 --> 06:29.000
we have three categories of people:

06:29.291 --> 06:32.041
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

06:33.500 --> 06:37.750
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

06:38.083 --> 06:40.041
means human beings;

06:40.291 --> 06:42.208
and the third ones are rakshasas.

06:43.333 --> 06:48.750
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

06:48.999 --> 06:50.875
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

06:51.333 --> 06:54.000
that seriously unless and until you were there.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.375
After all, why should you believe Me also that

06:57.667 --> 07:00.333
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

07:00.667 --> 07:04.709
this thing, and She did this and did that?

07:05.125 --> 07:09.125
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

07:09.375 --> 07:12.125
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

07:12.375 --> 07:17.959
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

07:18.208 --> 07:21.083
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

07:21.375 --> 07:23.792
on the center Heart,

07:24.333 --> 07:27.166
you can feel

07:27.542 --> 07:30.667
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

07:30.999 --> 07:34.333
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

07:35.125 --> 07:38.667
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.959
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

07:42.333 --> 07:47.959
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

07:48.250 --> 07:52.875
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.542
So now you have verified it much more

07:55.875 --> 07:57.959
than the scientists have done.

07:57.959 --> 08:01.208
The scientists are going from outside,

08:01.625 --> 08:03.291
and they are not conclusive at all.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.166
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

08:06.625 --> 08:08.542
another problem – they work out problems,

08:08.875 --> 08:11.667
but they don’t know the basics,

08:11.999 --> 08:16.125
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

08:16.542 --> 08:23.834
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

08:24.458 --> 08:28.291
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

08:28.709 --> 08:31.375
of the Adi Shakti within you,

08:31.834 --> 08:36.667
when She rises through these different chakras,

08:37.208 --> 08:40.291
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

08:40.667 --> 08:42.291
She’s the Shakti.

08:42.750 --> 08:47.417
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

08:48.999 --> 08:52.667
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

08:53.208 --> 08:56.917
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

08:57.208 --> 09:00.583
by which all these chakras are enlightened

09:00.959 --> 09:03.250
and all the deities are awakened.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.375
Supposing we have no power of life,

09:07.709 --> 09:09.999
we’ll be like dead people.

09:10.834 --> 09:14.166
So these centers when they receive this power,

09:14.500 --> 09:17.291
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

09:17.542 --> 09:20.500
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.625
It’s all tangible,

09:23.041 --> 09:26.083
you can verify it.

09:26.875 --> 09:32.792
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.709
Now see how Heart center is placed –

09:35.709 --> 09:37.709
also very interesting to see.

09:38.458 --> 09:44.166
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

09:44.500 --> 09:50.959
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.291
like Kundalini.

09:53.709 --> 09:56.750
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

09:57.208 --> 10:01.542
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

10:01.917 --> 10:05.917
She resides on the Heart center.

10:06.542 --> 10:10.542
Now this Heart center is very important.

10:11.417 --> 10:15.792
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

10:16.125 --> 10:20.625
is about, till the twelve years of age,

10:21.041 --> 10:26.500
this center produces the ganas.

10:27.375 --> 10:32.875
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

10:33.250 --> 10:38.417
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

10:38.959 --> 10:47.667
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

10:49.917 --> 10:54.500
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

10:54.792 --> 10:57.834
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

10:58.041 --> 11:01.333
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

11:01.333 --> 11:03.375
This is the kumbha.

11:03.917 --> 11:06.333
Now this kumbha She has established first:

11:06.583 --> 11:08.208
that is the triangular bone.

11:08.208 --> 11:12.333
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

11:12.959 --> 11:14.959
your Mooladhara.

11:15.375 --> 11:19.250
So She established within you is innocence.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.959
She established innocence within you to begin with.

11:23.250 --> 11:28.375
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

11:28.667 --> 11:30.417
as Kundalini now.

11:30.792 --> 11:35.875
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

11:36.250 --> 11:40.999
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

11:41.250 --> 11:46.542
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

11:46.959 --> 11:50.750
to create now –

11:51.083 --> 11:55.875
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

11:56.291 --> 12:00.083
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

12:00.458 --> 12:03.000
innocence.

12:03.250 --> 12:07.792
Now if you see the stones,

12:08.125 --> 12:10.583
they’re innocent.

12:11.458 --> 12:13.166
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

12:13.458 --> 12:16.250
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.709
They’re innocent.

12:19.583 --> 12:26.417
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

12:28.041 --> 12:32.750
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

12:33.333 --> 12:37.750
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

12:38.125 --> 12:41.000
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.542
They’re innocent,

12:42.917 --> 12:47.458
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.709
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

12:53.041 --> 12:58.875
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

12:59.250 --> 13:02.250
command of God Almighty,

13:02.583 --> 13:06.500
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

13:06.959 --> 13:12.083
because they have no free will to do what they like.

13:12.500 --> 13:17.291
So then if you see the animals also,

13:17.625 --> 13:22.333
they also are innocent, except for very few.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.917
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

13:26.333 --> 13:30.208
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

13:30.500 --> 13:33.917
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

13:34.166 --> 13:37.458
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

13:38.166 --> 13:40.583
and a snake will behave like a snake.

13:40.959 --> 13:44.709
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

13:45.083 --> 13:49.041
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

13:49.417 --> 13:51.417
There’s no steadiness.

13:51.792 --> 13:54.750
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.166
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

13:57.542 --> 14:03.125
They have no free will to change their individuality.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.959
They are left alone.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.709
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.375
That’s already been created, they are there,

14:12.709 --> 14:15.583
and they are existing.

14:16.250 --> 14:19.291
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

14:19.709 --> 14:23.709
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

14:24.041 --> 14:26.999
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

14:27.417 --> 14:32.750
So She has created all these things just for you

14:33.041 --> 14:39.458
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

14:39.792 --> 14:41.667
to have meaning for your life,

14:41.917 --> 14:43.792
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

14:44.208 --> 14:47.250
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.250
All is Her work.

14:49.834 --> 14:53.834
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

14:54.125 --> 14:57.959
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

14:58.750 --> 15:03.125
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

15:03.458 --> 15:06.583
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.542
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

15:08.834 --> 15:12.709
means three Mothers put together.

15:13.250 --> 15:18.500
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

15:18.917 --> 15:25.999
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

15:26.375 --> 15:28.417
complete control,

15:29.041 --> 15:34.542
as if without the permission or without the taking

15:34.792 --> 15:40.999
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.417
Is a fact,

15:44.792 --> 15:47.667
and that is where human beings fail,

15:47.917 --> 15:49.834
because they have a free will,

15:50.125 --> 15:53.458
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

15:53.792 --> 15:57.125
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

15:57.709 --> 16:02.959
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

16:03.250 --> 16:05.375
the task is very difficult;

16:06.291 --> 16:09.999
because you are not used to

16:10.542 --> 16:13.999
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

16:14.959 --> 16:16.959
Specially in the Western countries,

16:17.166 --> 16:21.500
people have choices even for their cereals.

16:21.750 --> 16:27.917
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

16:28.750 --> 16:31.458
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

16:31.709 --> 16:36.667
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

16:36.999 --> 16:42.458
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

16:42.834 --> 16:45.750
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

16:46.291 --> 16:49.041
this is not right, and this is not right.

16:49.458 --> 16:57.542
So the same Power has now been awakened in

16:57.999 --> 16:59.959
the Paramachaitanya.

17:00.542 --> 17:03.417
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

17:03.792 --> 17:07.792
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.875
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.458
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

17:14.709 --> 17:17.542
you are surprised. I mean,

17:17.792 --> 17:20.834
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

17:21.125 --> 17:22.792
is busy with.

17:23.041 --> 17:27.000
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

17:27.375 --> 17:33.375
to convince you people about the truth.

17:33.709 --> 17:37.250
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.542
would have been much better.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.291
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

17:42.542 --> 17:46.583
the most difficult things to manage.

17:46.917 --> 17:50.458
They have been given freedom; that too,

17:50.709 --> 17:51.999
you’d be amazed,

17:52.333 --> 17:56.125
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

17:56.375 --> 17:57.709
but how it was achieved,

17:57.709 --> 17:59.333
we should understand this.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.041
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

18:02.333 --> 18:08.875
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

18:10.125 --> 18:15.500
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

18:15.834 --> 18:17.208
no free will.

18:17.542 --> 18:23.999
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

18:24.291 --> 18:29.083
would not have even thought of knowing anything

18:29.333 --> 18:33.333
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.083
They were just like animals.

18:36.375 --> 18:41.625
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

18:42.000 --> 18:43.250
and went and told them that

18:43.583 --> 18:46.625
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

18:47.000 --> 18:49.291
She wanted to evolve.

18:49.291 --> 18:52.709
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.709
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

18:54.959 --> 18:57.500
to do such a thing.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.542
He thought, “What is the need to have

18:59.792 --> 19:02.291
such headaches around Me?”

19:02.792 --> 19:05.875
But Shakti knew Her own style.

19:06.083 --> 19:11.125
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

19:11.542 --> 19:15.333
and She can make these human beings understand

19:15.583 --> 19:18.625
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

19:19.000 --> 19:21.834
knowledgeable.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.375
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

19:24.750 --> 19:31.875
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

19:32.999 --> 19:39.208
So a new type of human race started,

19:39.875 --> 19:44.667
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

19:44.917 --> 19:48.000
You have seen that we had all kinds

19:48.333 --> 19:50.917
of primitive people before.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.333
Then they started evolving, evolving.

19:54.709 --> 19:58.333
Now, I have to say that

19:59.000 --> 20:04.875
the first creation which took place before that,

20:06.417 --> 20:10.083
there were other higher creations

20:15.375 --> 20:19.834
which were planned by Adi Shakti

20:20.291 --> 20:24.083
to plan out the whole thing.

20:24.417 --> 20:27.083
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

20:27.417 --> 20:33.750
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

20:34.000 --> 20:37.667
say their areas.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.333
In that all the planning was done,

20:39.667 --> 20:44.125
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

20:44.375 --> 20:47.333
souls, from animal to human beings,

20:47.625 --> 20:51.000
and from human beings to realized souls.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.000
It was a very big problem.

20:54.291 --> 20:57.999
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

20:58.291 --> 20:59.875
Vishnu had His own loka,

21:00.083 --> 21:01.625
Mahesha had His own loka,

21:01.875 --> 21:04.500
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

21:04.750 --> 21:08.792
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

21:08.792 --> 21:12.291
Because these three channels were created in human

21:12.542 --> 21:14.458
beings later on.

21:14.458 --> 21:18.709
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

21:18.999 --> 21:20.959
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.375
They produced two children,

21:24.667 --> 21:26.834
one shakti and one the brother,

21:27.208 --> 21:29.333
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

21:29.583 --> 21:33.625
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

21:33.959 --> 21:36.959
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

21:37.417 --> 21:42.667
the energy was given to the potential man.

21:43.041 --> 21:46.333
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

21:46.750 --> 21:49.208
was given to a man.

21:51.125 --> 21:53.000
All these things happened,

21:53.709 --> 21:59.834
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

22:00.291 --> 22:04.208
It happened like this, that the first working

22:04.625 --> 22:08.917
somehow or other was very effective in India.

22:09.333 --> 22:12.083
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

22:12.542 --> 22:13.583
is so good.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.834
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.208
It’s not like this anytime,

22:17.542 --> 22:21.417
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

22:21.792 --> 22:22.999
you have to play football also with

22:22.999 --> 22:25.583
an umbrella on your head!

22:27.583 --> 22:30.959
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

22:31.250 --> 22:33.333
and they are so well balanced.

22:33.709 --> 22:39.959
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

22:39.959 --> 22:43.583
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

22:43.917 --> 22:45.709
we cannot say.

22:45.959 --> 22:47.625
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

22:47.917 --> 22:51.125
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

22:51.500 --> 22:55.750
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

22:55.999 --> 22:59.500
of the one which makes seasons.

23:00.125 --> 23:04.667
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.083
It’s not at all understanding,

23:07.542 --> 23:09.834
because of the human beings as they are.

23:10.250 --> 23:14.166
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

23:14.625 --> 23:17.917
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

23:18.250 --> 23:20.417
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

23:20.959 --> 23:22.750
beings – is a fact.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.875
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

23:26.250 --> 23:29.999
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

23:31.750 --> 23:36.458
One has not studied the astrology of India,

23:36.792 --> 23:39.125
but they have their own astrology –

23:39.458 --> 23:41.125
of course, I don’t believe in it.

23:41.542 --> 23:46.083
But the, at the level of a human level

23:46.417 --> 23:48.667
you can see how they depict

23:49.083 --> 23:52.000
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

23:52.458 --> 23:56.250
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

23:56.792 --> 23:59.667
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

23:59.667 --> 24:02.291
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

24:02.625 --> 24:03.834
They will exactly say

24:03.834 --> 24:05.999
what time which star will be coming nearer,

24:06.250 --> 24:07.999
what star are today governing,

24:08.667 --> 24:10.333
tomorrow what will be the star there.

24:10.875 --> 24:15.166
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.542
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

24:18.917 --> 24:21.667
at that time in these Western countries,

24:22.125 --> 24:25.208
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

24:25.583 --> 24:31.625
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

24:32.834 --> 24:38.375
So then all this arrangement was made,

24:38.375 --> 24:43.208
and human beings were made to understand

24:43.542 --> 24:47.083
that there is God.

24:48.458 --> 24:52.667
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

24:53.000 --> 24:54.834
real saints were respected,

24:55.208 --> 24:59.792
and they made different observations.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.792
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

25:04.166 --> 25:07.917
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

25:08.291 --> 25:11.125
He knows how My knee looks like,

25:11.417 --> 25:14.709
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

25:15.041 --> 25:18.041
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

25:18.375 --> 25:21.542
knows everything about Me.

25:21.792 --> 25:23.792
That means through his meditative power he could

25:24.208 --> 25:26.792
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

25:27.208 --> 25:30.583
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

25:30.999 --> 25:34.542
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

25:34.999 --> 25:39.583
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

25:39.917 --> 25:43.250
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.750
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

25:47.000 --> 25:49.583
is there, is a fact.

25:50.125 --> 25:53.375
And it is the Knowledge of these people

25:53.709 --> 25:57.083
is most remarkable: how did they know that

25:57.417 --> 25:59.999
a Goddess is like that?

26:00.291 --> 26:03.333
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

26:03.333 --> 26:08.041
but they are there, and they have described.

26:08.709 --> 26:10.166
It’s very surprising.

26:10.625 --> 26:13.166
So their meditative power in India was great.

26:13.542 --> 26:18.500
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

26:18.959 --> 26:21.291
people are disciplined.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.792
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

26:24.041 --> 26:26.625
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

26:27.083 --> 26:31.542
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

26:31.875 --> 26:36.250
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

26:36.542 --> 26:40.208
and then sleep off – normally.

26:40.834 --> 26:42.583
Very disciplined.

26:42.917 --> 26:44.999
They don’t go on holidays,

26:45.333 --> 26:47.917
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

26:48.208 --> 26:51.542
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

26:51.834 --> 26:53.959
he’s thrown out of the house.

26:54.375 --> 26:57.333
He’s condemned as a leper.

26:57.709 --> 27:01.625
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

27:02.625 --> 27:05.500
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

27:06.125 --> 27:10.667
but they too, they hide their drinking.

27:11.041 --> 27:13.500
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

27:13.999 --> 27:17.083
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

27:17.333 --> 27:19.667
and people will start openly drinking,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.999
but normally they don’t.

27:23.917 --> 27:27.083
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

27:27.417 --> 27:33.375
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

27:33.792 --> 27:38.458
Now, people could live in the jungles.

27:38.834 --> 27:41.458
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

27:41.709 --> 27:44.250
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

27:44.709 --> 27:47.999
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

27:48.291 --> 27:51.041
otherwise you can’t get out.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.417
And you start from one place; reaching another place

27:53.792 --> 27:56.458
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

27:56.750 --> 27:58.875
you get drenched.

27:59.458 --> 28:02.333
But this is not so in India.

28:02.583 --> 28:05.458
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

28:05.709 --> 28:07.834
in winter-time, you have seen it.

28:08.208 --> 28:11.083
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

28:11.375 --> 28:13.000
at a wrong time.

28:13.250 --> 28:16.125
You can stay outside as long as you want.

28:16.750 --> 28:19.291
So these people could live in the jungles,

28:19.583 --> 28:24.041
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

28:24.041 --> 28:27.417
In a simple little hut they could live:

28:27.792 --> 28:29.458
a little protection from the sun,

28:29.875 --> 28:33.792
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

28:34.083 --> 28:35.375
that’s all.

28:36.792 --> 28:40.083
And they had very little needs of life.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.333
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

28:42.583 --> 28:44.792
there were no plastics that time, or even now

28:45.000 --> 28:47.458
we don’t use plastics.

28:47.834 --> 28:52.000
And we used to have few thalis and things.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.500
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

28:55.834 --> 29:00.166
which were just permanently with the family.

29:00.583 --> 29:03.959
Now I find that such a difference there is.

29:03.959 --> 29:07.125
You see, in simple living what happens,

29:07.667 --> 29:12.917
that you do not take out

29:13.208 --> 29:15.458
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

29:15.834 --> 29:17.959
There’s no ecological problem there.

29:18.458 --> 29:22.375
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

29:22.750 --> 29:25.417
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

29:25.709 --> 29:31.750
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

29:32.083 --> 29:34.999
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

29:35.375 --> 29:38.542
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

29:38.792 --> 29:43.166
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

29:43.542 --> 29:46.208
and such problems are there.

29:46.709 --> 29:50.458
So this Shakti that was working in those days

29:50.709 --> 29:56.041
was in them to make them seekers;

29:56.667 --> 29:59.458
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.709
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

30:01.999 --> 30:03.250
you have place to sleep,

30:03.250 --> 30:06.875
finished – not much to be done,

30:07.166 --> 30:09.500
living so happily.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.625
With all these

30:13.667 --> 30:18.583
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

30:18.999 --> 30:20.834
they had time, lot of time.

30:21.333 --> 30:26.125
And with that time, what did they do?

30:26.500 --> 30:30.917
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

30:31.333 --> 30:34.583
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.959
With that time they meditated.

30:38.291 --> 30:40.999
And when that time meditation started,

30:41.542 --> 30:46.750
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

30:47.083 --> 30:50.208
what is Divinity, what is God.

30:50.750 --> 30:53.542
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

30:53.875 --> 30:57.417
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

30:57.709 --> 31:00.792
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.125
It never comes to their head that

31:04.542 --> 31:06.834
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

31:07.041 --> 31:09.500
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

31:09.834 --> 31:13.375
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

31:13.625 --> 31:15.458
because you have come through Him?

31:15.834 --> 31:17.834
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

31:18.041 --> 31:18.875
must be that.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.542
And now when I told them these are His powers,

31:21.834 --> 31:23.542
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

31:24.375 --> 31:26.625
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

31:26.959 --> 31:29.166
They are God.

31:29.417 --> 31:30.999
Nobody discusses these things.

31:30.999 --> 31:33.667
God is – how can you understand God?

31:33.917 --> 31:36.333
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

31:36.583 --> 31:39.917
Try – you can’t understand Me.

31:39.917 --> 31:41.999
Very difficult.

31:42.375 --> 31:44.667
So you can’t understand,

31:45.083 --> 31:46.500
you can’t understand God.

31:46.959 --> 31:48.458
Please understand one thing,

31:48.834 --> 31:51.917
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

31:52.291 --> 31:53.959
But you can be in connection with God,

31:54.500 --> 31:56.041
you can be in the company of God,

31:56.709 --> 31:57.999
you can be blessed by God,

31:58.500 --> 32:00.375
you can be looked after by God,

32:00.834 --> 32:03.166
you can know lots of things about God;

32:03.542 --> 32:07.542
but you cannot understand.

32:08.792 --> 32:12.291
This is another thing one has to know,

32:12.750 --> 32:16.333
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

32:16.709 --> 32:19.208
why He does this, why He does that.

32:19.542 --> 32:22.250
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

32:22.792 --> 32:24.333
I mean, somebody can even say here,

32:24.333 --> 32:26.333
“Why did He make swastika?”

32:26.667 --> 32:28.250
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

32:28.625 --> 32:30.959
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

32:31.375 --> 32:35.375
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

32:35.709 --> 32:37.250
They can go to that limit, you know,

32:37.875 --> 32:41.166
there’s nothing surprising.

32:41.542 --> 32:45.166
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.500
We think no end of ourselves,

32:47.750 --> 32:49.458
we are very self-opinionated,

32:49.875 --> 32:52.458
and we do not know much about it.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.792
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

32:58.083 --> 33:00.917
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

33:01.375 --> 33:02.959
but still you will not understand God.

33:03.375 --> 33:06.917
You have to go above God to understand Him.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.959
How will you understand?

33:09.959 --> 33:11.667
Supposing there’s something below you,

33:11.667 --> 33:13.000
you can understand;

33:13.291 --> 33:14.917
but something above you, how will you understand?

33:15.291 --> 33:17.917
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

33:18.458 --> 33:19.917
and wants to understand about My house,

33:20.583 --> 33:23.333
will he understand?

33:23.709 --> 33:29.041
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

33:29.750 --> 33:32.166
So the Source from which we have come,

33:32.709 --> 33:34.959
we cannot understand that.

33:35.291 --> 33:36.750
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

33:37.875 --> 33:43.999
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

33:44.208 --> 33:46.083
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

33:46.500 --> 33:49.291
we’ll be happy with that.

33:49.792 --> 33:52.917
And the power that is within you is Amba,

33:53.458 --> 33:55.875
is the desire power of God itself.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.583
So whatever your wish is, means that

33:58.417 --> 34:03.208
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.375
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

34:07.041 --> 34:09.166
Then the Shakti makes you

34:09.709 --> 34:14.583
sit on different beautiful positions,

34:16.125 --> 34:18.417
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

34:19.041 --> 34:21.999
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

34:22.500 --> 34:25.083
in the Kingdom of God.

34:25.625 --> 34:28.417
Now you should assume your power.

34:28.917 --> 34:31.417
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

34:31.875 --> 34:36.709
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

34:36.999 --> 34:38.250
where you must assume.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.542
I have told you many a times, now believe that

34:40.542 --> 34:42.792
you are Sahaja yogis.

34:42.792 --> 34:45.959
Believe that you are,

34:46.208 --> 34:48.917
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.834
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

34:51.834 --> 34:53.875
why She does that, why He does that.

34:54.291 --> 34:56.999
You cannot say that – that’s different.

34:57.291 --> 35:01.625
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

35:01.959 --> 35:05.208
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

35:05.625 --> 35:08.875
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

35:09.291 --> 35:13.667
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

35:14.083 --> 35:17.542
and made knowledgeable.

35:17.917 --> 35:21.125
But still this arrogance has to go down,

35:21.375 --> 35:25.125
that we can understand why it happens.

35:25.709 --> 35:29.500
That humility is very important for us;

35:29.834 --> 35:33.166
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

35:33.834 --> 35:36.291
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

35:36.709 --> 35:39.959
now this power has to go higher and higher.

35:40.208 --> 35:44.999
For that, first you should be humble.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.875
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

35:48.083 --> 35:52.750
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

35:53.125 --> 35:56.709
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

35:57.208 --> 36:00.917
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

36:01.250 --> 36:03.458
You are too great.

36:03.834 --> 36:08.834
But let us know ourselves.”

36:09.458 --> 36:11.875
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

36:12.375 --> 36:14.625
like His own image.

36:15.125 --> 36:18.166
That means He has given you all the powers.

36:18.750 --> 36:19.834
He has made you.

36:20.208 --> 36:24.667
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.792
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

36:28.458 --> 36:31.333
He has made you in His own image.

36:31.709 --> 36:37.834
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.375
These powers are with you.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.208
But the first thing you have to have,

36:42.583 --> 36:44.417
the discipline within yourself,

36:44.999 --> 36:46.333
that is missing.

36:46.792 --> 36:48.333
People cannot discipline themselves – means

36:48.709 --> 36:50.458
if they cannot control themselves,

36:50.792 --> 36:54.125
how can they control anyone?

36:56.166 --> 36:59.709
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

37:00.166 --> 37:01.875
So the discipline should be that first

37:02.291 --> 37:04.999
you must see that you control yourself,

37:05.417 --> 37:09.542
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

37:09.999 --> 37:13.083
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

37:13.417 --> 37:16.792
where they show a stupid man, you see?

37:17.667 --> 37:21.875
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

37:22.333 --> 37:23.875
of the Goddess,

37:24.208 --> 37:26.250
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

37:26.667 --> 37:30.083
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

37:30.500 --> 37:34.333
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

37:34.625 --> 37:37.166
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

37:37.500 --> 37:39.750
you want to sit on the sides,

37:40.041 --> 37:43.709
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

37:43.959 --> 37:45.625
There’s no discipline.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.750
You have to have the discipline.

37:48.291 --> 37:49.542
Where are you sitting?

37:50.041 --> 37:52.083
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

37:52.542 --> 37:53.999
So you should have that dignity,

37:54.542 --> 37:55.999
you should have that affection,

37:56.625 --> 37:57.999
you should have that compassion,

37:58.333 --> 38:02.667
you must have that love, and the dedication.

38:02.999 --> 38:05.542
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

38:05.917 --> 38:09.083
because you are the vehicle of that power.

38:09.375 --> 38:13.250
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

38:13.709 --> 38:16.166
which is emptied inside.

38:16.458 --> 38:17.959
If it is already full with ego,

38:18.375 --> 38:20.500
what can you put inside that?

38:20.750 --> 38:23.417
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

38:23.834 --> 38:31.500
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

38:31.875 --> 38:34.208
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

38:34.750 --> 38:40.999
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

38:41.250 --> 38:44.917
or whatever it is, only that,

38:45.208 --> 38:48.250
then you cannot rise very high.

38:48.709 --> 38:50.917
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

38:51.583 --> 38:55.166
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

38:55.709 --> 39:01.542
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

39:02.041 --> 39:04.083
Then the desire of God will work.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.083
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

39:07.500 --> 39:08.750
of God,

39:09.208 --> 39:12.625
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

39:13.208 --> 39:18.208
but is the one which will fulfill your

39:18.542 --> 39:20.542
complete so-called desires,

39:21.208 --> 39:23.208
without even your Knowledge.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.542
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

39:26.834 --> 39:29.583
that now we do not know how to compile the book

39:29.917 --> 39:31.125
even on miracles.

39:31.583 --> 39:33.375
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

39:33.917 --> 39:35.291
realized souls.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.166
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

39:39.709 --> 39:43.083
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

39:43.542 --> 39:45.166
now what is my situation?

39:45.625 --> 39:48.667
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

39:48.999 --> 39:54.166
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

39:54.750 --> 39:56.750
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

39:57.125 --> 39:59.458
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

39:59.875 --> 40:01.709
you have known something which is tangible,

40:02.125 --> 40:04.208
you have got the experience of it.

40:04.583 --> 40:08.959
Still you are not surrendered.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.500
If you surrender to the will of God,

40:11.834 --> 40:14.250
then everything is taken charge.

40:14.625 --> 40:17.166
It will never let you down, no question;

40:17.750 --> 40:20.166
and everything, all things which look like

40:20.542 --> 40:23.875
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

40:24.500 --> 40:28.750
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

40:29.166 --> 40:32.083
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

40:32.458 --> 40:35.291
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

40:35.917 --> 40:42.000
by the people from a country which is discipline

40:42.333 --> 40:47.375
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

40:47.709 --> 40:54.125
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.709
For example, they have a military:

41:01.041 --> 41:04.625
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

41:04.875 --> 41:05.959
to attack?

41:06.542 --> 41:07.667
No one.

41:08.041 --> 41:09.417
Why do they have military?

41:09.875 --> 41:11.625
And compulsory military, do you know that?

41:11.917 --> 41:13.625
Because they have looted other people’s money and

41:13.999 --> 41:16.917
kept them there, like thugs.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.000
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

41:19.333 --> 41:22.375
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

41:22.667 --> 41:31.583
demand the money, and may start using the power

41:31.834 --> 41:33.375
of destruction on us.

41:33.750 --> 41:35.500
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

41:36.041 --> 41:40.542
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

41:40.959 --> 41:42.834
There is no need to have any military there.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.208
But everybody has to go to military

41:45.500 --> 41:47.875
and join the military,

41:48.208 --> 41:54.917
because they are thieves of the worst type.

41:55.792 --> 41:59.458
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

41:59.917 --> 42:01.709
of the watch, which human beings have made,

42:02.083 --> 42:04.250
God has not made.

42:04.792 --> 42:07.041
So the watch is important, because they are

42:07.500 --> 42:10.041
making watches.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.375
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

42:13.625 --> 42:18.583
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

42:18.959 --> 42:21.083
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

42:21.542 --> 42:22.834
and the way you are?”

42:23.083 --> 42:24.875
So they are very disciplined.

42:25.625 --> 42:28.375
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

42:28.750 --> 42:30.750
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

42:31.083 --> 42:35.999
too much of cleanliness in them.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.125
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

42:39.583 --> 42:42.709
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

42:43.041 --> 42:45.041
were married from Switzerland,

42:45.500 --> 42:46.709
and the reports have come that

42:47.000 --> 42:48.709
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

42:49.000 --> 42:50.625
or bar-maids.”

42:51.000 --> 42:52.417
So I said, “Why?”

42:52.750 --> 42:54.250
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

42:54.625 --> 42:56.291
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.208
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

42:59.542 --> 43:01.625
you see the guests are sitting

43:01.625 --> 43:02.999
and they have no time to talk.

43:03.291 --> 43:04.875
There’s no question of talking to each other,

43:05.291 --> 43:06.083
there’s nothing;

43:06.875 --> 43:08.125
all the time they are worried about

43:08.583 --> 43:09.792
this thing, this is getting dirty,

43:10.333 --> 43:13.083
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

43:13.500 --> 43:14.375
Can you imagine?

43:14.834 --> 43:17.792
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

43:18.041 --> 43:19.166
that they have.

43:19.709 --> 43:24.041
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.166
Nature is not like that.

43:26.542 --> 43:28.750
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

43:29.291 --> 43:32.750
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

43:33.041 --> 43:35.041
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

43:35.417 --> 43:39.291
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

43:39.667 --> 43:42.917
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

43:43.417 --> 43:46.333
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

43:46.709 --> 43:47.999
a little leisure.

43:48.458 --> 43:50.083
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

43:50.375 --> 43:51.709
so clean the house.

43:52.083 --> 43:53.208
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

43:53.500 --> 43:56.166
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

43:56.625 --> 44:02.625
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

44:03.625 --> 44:05.500
And who can love such a woman

44:05.875 --> 44:11.750
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

44:17.667 --> 44:22.125
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

44:22.542 --> 44:25.333
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

44:25.709 --> 44:30.250
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

44:30.709 --> 44:32.709
that in England –

44:33.333 --> 44:35.959
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

44:36.458 --> 44:38.834
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

44:39.250 --> 44:43.250
and that is going too far.

44:43.583 --> 44:47.250
So this is in between one has to be.

44:47.709 --> 44:51.999
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

44:52.208 --> 44:55.917
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

44:56.417 --> 44:58.166
So cleanliness has to be there.

44:58.583 --> 44:59.458
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

44:59.959 --> 45:01.000
but it should not be that

45:01.375 --> 45:04.250
everybody should be panicked about it;

45:04.750 --> 45:08.834
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

45:09.208 --> 45:12.417
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

45:12.875 --> 45:15.041
to meditate.

45:15.041 --> 45:17.250
Even meditating they will be seeing round

45:17.625 --> 45:19.750
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

45:20.166 --> 45:21.999
and they will go and pick up.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.959
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

45:25.166 --> 45:26.083
start doing that!

45:27.375 --> 45:31.542
There’s no discipline of meditation,

45:31.959 --> 45:35.999
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

45:35.999 --> 45:41.959
discipline of following the will of God –

45:42.291 --> 45:44.417
that’s not there.

45:44.999 --> 45:47.291
Unless and that discipline comes many,

45:47.667 --> 45:51.417
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

45:51.875 --> 45:57.999
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

45:58.333 --> 46:02.917
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

46:03.375 --> 46:05.834
of meditation.

46:06.250 --> 46:11.250
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

46:11.625 --> 46:12.834
She knows your past,

46:13.625 --> 46:15.875
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

46:15.875 --> 46:19.125
Once you start introspecting

46:19.458 --> 46:21.375
and seeing it within yourself,

46:21.750 --> 46:24.500
“what is wrong with me?”

46:24.999 --> 46:28.375
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

46:28.834 --> 46:30.208
“what have I to do?” –

46:30.667 --> 46:34.542
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

46:35.208 --> 46:39.542
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

46:39.917 --> 46:41.917
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

46:42.291 --> 46:45.083
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

46:45.583 --> 46:49.500
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

46:50.125 --> 46:53.000
You must meditate, and the meditation

46:53.375 --> 46:55.583
should be little bit in the morning

46:55.917 --> 46:57.750
and little bit in the evening.

46:58.166 --> 47:01.792
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.667
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

47:10.083 --> 47:11.667
It takes hardly any time.

47:11.667 --> 47:13.208
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

47:13.625 --> 47:16.999
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

47:17.333 --> 47:20.542
if you can give for your meditation,

47:20.917 --> 47:23.667
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

47:24.166 --> 47:26.792
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

47:27.125 --> 47:29.999
will improve, everything will work out.

47:30.208 --> 47:32.792
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

47:33.250 --> 47:35.834
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

47:36.458 --> 47:39.500
your body itself will be full of perfume.

47:39.959 --> 47:41.500
Everything will be supplied.

47:41.917 --> 47:45.834
So what we have to do is to first of all see

47:46.041 --> 47:49.291
a surrender to the will of the God.

47:49.625 --> 47:52.750
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

47:52.999 --> 47:55.959
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

47:56.166 --> 47:58.333
You surrender your problems also.

47:58.625 --> 48:01.041
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

48:01.417 --> 48:05.000
You do this.”

48:05.458 --> 48:09.250
It is such a precise, such an effective,

48:09.583 --> 48:15.333
such an efficient Power.

48:16.375 --> 48:22.709
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

48:23.041 --> 48:24.250
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

48:24.750 --> 48:26.250
“All right, it will be all right.”

48:26.625 --> 48:29.125
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

48:29.500 --> 48:34.250
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

48:34.750 --> 48:38.999
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

48:39.542 --> 48:43.458
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

48:43.917 --> 48:46.417
which is the most important for all of you,

48:47.208 --> 48:53.792
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

48:54.250 --> 48:57.000
And by its activity you should know it is become

48:57.500 --> 48:59.125
very powerful,

48:59.834 --> 49:04.959
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

49:05.625 --> 49:09.375
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

49:09.959 --> 49:12.250
It will take care of it.

49:13.166 --> 49:15.834
All wrong things you have done,

49:16.375 --> 49:18.291
all bad karmas you have done,

49:18.875 --> 49:22.917
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.583
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

49:26.000 --> 49:27.709
you are not on that level.

49:27.709 --> 49:30.291
Like we can say that ordinary people

49:30.667 --> 49:32.917
can be charged with criminality,

49:33.291 --> 49:37.542
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

49:37.917 --> 49:40.083
then nobody can charge you.

49:40.583 --> 49:42.417
You are above the law.

49:42.999 --> 49:45.667
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

49:46.000 --> 49:49.208
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

49:49.834 --> 49:53.125
nobody can hamper your progress.

49:53.500 --> 49:57.250
Only it is you who can do it.

49:57.750 --> 49:59.625
And nobody can harm Me,

49:59.959 --> 50:02.375
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

50:02.875 --> 50:07.041
But it is you who can harm Me;

50:07.625 --> 50:11.959
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

50:12.291 --> 50:16.083
and I am working it out in My body,

50:16.542 --> 50:19.875
everything, your cleansing, everything,

50:20.291 --> 50:22.125
which is a difficult task.

50:22.458 --> 50:24.083
But in the beginning only,

50:24.375 --> 50:27.208
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

50:27.667 --> 50:29.667
“you must have the Knowledge.”

50:29.667 --> 50:33.333
So that promise has to be fulfilled

50:33.667 --> 50:34.917
and that has to be done,

50:35.250 --> 50:36.834
though it’s a very hazardous task.

50:37.250 --> 50:39.917
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

50:40.333 --> 50:43.834
to make people understand

50:44.500 --> 50:48.583
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

50:49.041 --> 50:51.000
it’s a very difficult task.

50:51.417 --> 50:52.834
They talk of big, big things.

50:53.291 --> 50:54.500
I have seen people write articles nowadays

50:55.250 --> 50:56.999
that nothing is substantial,

50:57.542 --> 51:02.667
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

51:03.041 --> 51:05.875
All these big, big books they are writing.

51:06.417 --> 51:08.417
But if you write to them now that we have found out

51:08.750 --> 51:11.333
something, they don’t want to see you.

51:11.792 --> 51:13.083
They don’t want to meet you.

51:13.583 --> 51:15.083
They have nothing to do with it.

51:15.667 --> 51:17.000
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

51:17.542 --> 51:21.208
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

51:21.792 --> 51:24.125
What are they seeking?

51:24.500 --> 51:26.458
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

51:26.750 --> 51:28.375
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

51:28.834 --> 51:31.500
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

51:31.834 --> 51:34.125
you have no destination.

51:34.750 --> 51:37.291
In the same way they are without any destination,

51:37.875 --> 51:39.667
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

51:39.959 --> 51:45.166
we are doing that” – without any destination,

51:45.875 --> 51:46.083
without any understanding,

51:46.458 --> 51:47.750
without any meaning to their life,

51:48.125 --> 51:49.999
absolutely useless people.

51:50.417 --> 51:51.917
They are worth nothing.

51:52.250 --> 51:53.999
We have to try as much as possible

51:54.375 --> 51:55.792
how many we can save;

51:56.125 --> 51:57.625
but those who do not want to come,

51:58.000 --> 52:00.709
there’s no need,

52:00.834 --> 52:02.417
there's no need for us.

52:02.750 --> 52:05.583
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

52:06.041 --> 52:08.500
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

52:08.834 --> 52:10.208
then only we’ll have.

52:11.083 --> 52:12.291
I never write any letter to anyone,

52:12.667 --> 52:14.291
“Please come to My program.”

52:14.750 --> 52:16.792
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

52:17.083 --> 52:20.875
musicians and all that; I never write.

52:21.208 --> 52:22.875
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

52:23.333 --> 52:25.542
if you want to come you can come.

52:25.875 --> 52:29.333
This advertisement also I was not willing.

52:31.125 --> 52:34.917
So you can imagine that

52:35.500 --> 52:41.500
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

52:41.917 --> 52:46.500
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

52:46.999 --> 52:49.375
And you have the Knowledge.

52:49.999 --> 52:51.999
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

52:52.500 --> 52:55.166
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

52:55.667 --> 52:57.999
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

52:58.792 --> 53:02.417
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

53:02.917 --> 53:07.000
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

53:07.792 --> 53:10.999
She created you for this purpose,

53:11.458 --> 53:13.959
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

53:14.458 --> 53:16.959
level for this purpose,

53:17.458 --> 53:19.583
and that is what you have to do it.

53:19.583 --> 53:25.750
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

53:26.041 --> 53:27.291
then know that

53:27.750 --> 53:33.709
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

53:34.208 --> 53:39.583
And unless and until you people rise to that level

53:39.959 --> 53:42.834
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

53:43.208 --> 53:45.458
like some people are still smoking,

53:45.709 --> 53:48.500
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

53:48.834 --> 53:50.834
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

53:51.041 --> 53:54.999
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

53:55.375 --> 53:57.875
useless people, where will they go?

53:58.417 --> 54:00.625
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

54:01.041 --> 54:04.917
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

54:05.417 --> 54:07.333
so what is going to happen to them?

54:07.667 --> 54:08.750
But all this is available to you;

54:09.083 --> 54:10.000
only thing you must know

54:10.417 --> 54:14.083
how to control yourself, control your senses.

54:14.458 --> 54:18.000
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

54:18.375 --> 54:21.000
If we cannot control our own horses,

54:21.375 --> 54:26.917
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

54:27.291 --> 54:30.250
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

54:30.625 --> 54:34.500
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

54:34.959 --> 54:37.875
and you have to give it to others.

54:38.291 --> 54:42.917
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

54:43.333 --> 54:45.792
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

54:46.417 --> 54:51.667
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

54:51.999 --> 54:54.709
God. How beautiful it is.

54:55.208 --> 54:58.125
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

54:58.458 --> 55:03.333
God for such a great purpose.”

55:03.709 --> 55:06.000
You are molded, you are made like that

55:06.458 --> 55:09.709
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

55:10.125 --> 55:13.999
and with this free will you have to rise.

55:14.291 --> 55:16.542
With this free will you have to understand

55:16.999 --> 55:22.625
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

55:23.792 --> 55:33.667
It is nature’s reaction to things.

55:34.208 --> 55:36.959
Always nature reacts to human beings.

55:37.375 --> 55:41.250
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

55:41.583 --> 55:44.125
and when the reaction of the God comes in

55:44.709 --> 55:47.625
then we find all these things happening.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.999
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

55:51.417 --> 55:55.625
which is very, very well explaining why all these

55:55.959 --> 56:01.041
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

56:01.417 --> 56:04.417
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

56:04.917 --> 56:07.417
and listen to it again and again.

56:07.792 --> 56:11.208
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

56:11.542 --> 56:13.834
but should be something you should try to understand.

56:14.208 --> 56:17.041
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

56:17.458 --> 56:19.709
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

56:20.125 --> 56:22.750
which none of them have said so far.

56:23.333 --> 56:25.166
Because you have got your realization,

56:25.750 --> 56:30.500
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

56:30.875 --> 56:39.625
May God bless you.
