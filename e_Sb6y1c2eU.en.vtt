Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.333
27th September, 1992

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.375
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.750
And when I found that the rain was there

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:21.750
and all kinds of problems,

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.625
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.750
I just consulted the calendar,

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:33.542
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:38.792
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.792
it’s inauspicious.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.583
After five forty-five only

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.709
the right thing starts,

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:56.875
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:04.291
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.750
after five forty-five.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.917
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:14.917
or in Europe after five forty-five.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.792
So it is something one must understand that

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:21.959
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.000
and it is giving all the suggestions;

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:27.125
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.834
tithi (auspicious time),

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:30.792
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.250
in the evening.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:34.250
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.291
and there it was.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.417
There’s so many things we have to see,

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:47.208
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.999
For example, I had said long time back

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:56.458
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:58.417
carbon atom,

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:06.667
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:13.250
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.999
So, now you see from left to the right,

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:21.375
then you see Omkara;

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.667
and once you see from down below upward,

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:30.166
you see the alpha and omega.

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:33.000
Now see, Christ has said that

00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:38.208
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:42.083
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:47.250
also becomes Christ.

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:50.125
You can see it very clearly.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:54.875
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.375
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.959
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.417
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:10.166
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:14.458
have come to us from

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.250
inside, from the Divine.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:22.583
This is not we have created.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.041
This was found out by some mathematicians

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:31.458
who were realized souls,

00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:35.500
and they used this alpha and omega.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.834
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:42.208
swastika becoming Omkar,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.208
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:53.458
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:56.333
can be verified.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.500
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.166
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.959
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.625
She fought all the people who were destroying

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.625
the seekers,

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.458
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:34.792
And these tortured saints,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.583
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:46.625
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.458
with what the Goddess is doing –

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:52.875
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:57.542
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:01.959
according to the need of the time.

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:06.291
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:09.917
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:13.792
thinking no end of themselves;

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.375
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:23.208
horrible rakshasas.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.834
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:29.000
we have three categories of people:

00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:32.041
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.750
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:40.041
means human beings;

00:06:40.291 --> 00:06:42.208
and the third ones are rakshasas.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:48.750
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:50.875
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:54.000
that seriously unless and until you were there.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:57.375
After all, why should you believe Me also that

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.333
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:04.709
this thing, and She did this and did that?

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:09.125
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:12.125
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:17.959
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:21.083
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:23.792
on the center Heart,

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:27.166
you can feel

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:30.667
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:34.333
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:38.667
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.959
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:47.959
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.875
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:55.542
So now you have verified it much more

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.959
than the scientists have done.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:01.208
The scientists are going from outside,

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.291
and they are not conclusive at all.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.166
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.542
another problem – they work out problems,

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:11.667
but they don’t know the basics,

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:16.125
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:23.834
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

00:08:24.458 --> 00:08:28.291
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:31.375
of the Adi Shakti within you,

00:08:31.834 --> 00:08:36.667
when She rises through these different chakras,

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:40.291
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:42.291
She’s the Shakti.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.417
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:52.667
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:56.917
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:00.583
by which all these chakras are enlightened

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:03.250
and all the deities are awakened.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.375
Supposing we have no power of life,

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:09.999
we’ll be like dead people.

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:14.166
So these centers when they receive this power,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.291
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:20.500
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:22.625
It’s all tangible,

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:26.083
you can verify it.

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:32.792
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.709
Now see how Heart center is placed –

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.709
also very interesting to see.

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:44.166
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.959
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.291
like Kundalini.

00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:56.750
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:01.542
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.917
She resides on the Heart center.

00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:10.542
Now this Heart center is very important.

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:15.792
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:20.625
is about, till the twelve years of age,

00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:26.500
this center produces the ganas.

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:32.875
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.417
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:47.667
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:54.500
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:57.834
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:01.333
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

00:11:01.333 --> 00:11:03.375
This is the kumbha.

00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:06.333
Now this kumbha She has established first:

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.208
that is the triangular bone.

00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:12.333
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:14.959
your Mooladhara.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:19.250
So She established within you is innocence.

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:22.959
She established innocence within you to begin with.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.375
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.417
as Kundalini now.

00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:35.875
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.999
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.542
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:50.750
to create now –

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:55.875
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.083
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:03.000
innocence.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.792
Now if you see the stones,

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:10.583
they’re innocent.

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:13.166
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:16.250
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.709
They’re innocent.

00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:26.417
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:32.750
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

00:12:33.333 --> 00:12:37.750
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:41.000
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:42.542
They’re innocent,

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:47.458
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:49.709
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:58.875
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.250
command of God Almighty,

00:13:02.583 --> 00:13:06.500
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:12.083
because they have no free will to do what they like.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.291
So then if you see the animals also,

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:22.333
they also are innocent, except for very few.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:25.917
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:30.208
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.917
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:37.458
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.583
and a snake will behave like a snake.

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:44.709
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:49.041
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.417
There’s no steadiness.

00:13:51.792 --> 00:13:54.750
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.166
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

00:13:57.542 --> 00:14:03.125
They have no free will to change their individuality.

00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:05.959
They are left alone.

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:09.709
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.375
That’s already been created, they are there,

00:14:12.709 --> 00:14:15.583
and they are existing.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.291
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:23.709
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.999
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:32.750
So She has created all these things just for you

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:39.458
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:41.667
to have meaning for your life,

00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:43.792
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

00:14:44.208 --> 00:14:47.250
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:49.250
All is Her work.

00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:53.834
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:57.959
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:03.125
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:06.583
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

00:15:06.875 --> 00:15:08.542
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:12.709
means three Mothers put together.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.500
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:25.999
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:28.417
complete control,

00:15:29.041 --> 00:15:34.542
as if without the permission or without the taking

00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:40.999
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:44.417
Is a fact,

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:47.667
and that is where human beings fail,

00:15:47.917 --> 00:15:49.834
because they have a free will,

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:53.458
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

00:15:53.792 --> 00:15:57.125
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

00:15:57.709 --> 00:16:02.959
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.375
the task is very difficult;

00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:09.999
because you are not used to

00:16:10.542 --> 00:16:13.999
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.959
Specially in the Western countries,

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:21.500
people have choices even for their cereals.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:27.917
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.458
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:36.667
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:42.458
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:45.750
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:49.041
this is not right, and this is not right.

00:16:49.458 --> 00:16:57.542
So the same Power has now been awakened in

00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:59.959
the Paramachaitanya.

00:17:00.542 --> 00:17:03.417
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:07.792
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:11.875
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:14.458
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:17.542
you are surprised. I mean,

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:20.834
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

00:17:21.125 --> 00:17:22.792
is busy with.

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:27.000
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:33.375
to convince you people about the truth.

00:17:33.709 --> 00:17:37.250
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.542
would have been much better.

00:17:39.542 --> 00:17:42.291
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:46.583
the most difficult things to manage.

00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:50.458
They have been given freedom; that too,

00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:51.999
you’d be amazed,

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:56.125
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:57.709
but how it was achieved,

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.333
we should understand this.

00:17:59.709 --> 00:18:02.041
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:08.875
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:15.500
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

00:18:15.834 --> 00:18:17.208
no free will.

00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:23.999
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:29.083
would not have even thought of knowing anything

00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:33.333
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:36.083
They were just like animals.

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:41.625
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.250
and went and told them that

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:46.625
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.291
She wanted to evolve.

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:52.709
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.709
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:57.500
to do such a thing.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.542
He thought, “What is the need to have

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:02.291
such headaches around Me?”

00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:05.875
But Shakti knew Her own style.

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:11.125
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:15.333
and She can make these human beings understand

00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:18.625
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.834
knowledgeable.

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:24.375
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:31.875
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

00:19:32.999 --> 00:19:39.208
So a new type of human race started,

00:19:39.875 --> 00:19:44.667
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:48.000
You have seen that we had all kinds

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:50.917
of primitive people before.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.333
Then they started evolving, evolving.

00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:58.333
Now, I have to say that

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.875
the first creation which took place before that,

00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:10.083
there were other higher creations

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:19.834
which were planned by Adi Shakti

00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:24.083
to plan out the whole thing.

00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:27.083
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

00:20:27.417 --> 00:20:33.750
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.667
say their areas.

00:20:37.917 --> 00:20:39.333
In that all the planning was done,

00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:44.125
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:47.333
souls, from animal to human beings,

00:20:47.625 --> 00:20:51.000
and from human beings to realized souls.

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:54.000
It was a very big problem.

00:20:54.291 --> 00:20:57.999
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

00:20:58.291 --> 00:20:59.875
Vishnu had His own loka,

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:01.625
Mahesha had His own loka,

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.500
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.792
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:12.291
Because these three channels were created in human

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:14.458
beings later on.

00:21:14.458 --> 00:21:18.709
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:20.959
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.375
They produced two children,

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.834
one shakti and one the brother,

00:21:27.208 --> 00:21:29.333
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:33.625
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.959
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:42.667
the energy was given to the potential man.

00:21:43.041 --> 00:21:46.333
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.208
was given to a man.

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:53.000
All these things happened,

00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:59.834
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:04.208
It happened like this, that the first working

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:08.917
somehow or other was very effective in India.

00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:12.083
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:13.583
is so good.

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.834
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.208
It’s not like this anytime,

00:22:17.542 --> 00:22:21.417
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:22.999
you have to play football also with

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.583
an umbrella on your head!

00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:30.959
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.333
and they are so well balanced.

00:22:33.709 --> 00:22:39.959
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:43.583
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

00:22:43.917 --> 00:22:45.709
we cannot say.

00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:47.625
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:51.125
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.750
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:59.500
of the one which makes seasons.

00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:04.667
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.083
It’s not at all understanding,

00:23:07.542 --> 00:23:09.834
because of the human beings as they are.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.166
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:17.917
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.417
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:22.750
beings – is a fact.

00:23:23.166 --> 00:23:25.875
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.999
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.458
One has not studied the astrology of India,

00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:39.125
but they have their own astrology –

00:23:39.458 --> 00:23:41.125
of course, I don’t believe in it.

00:23:41.542 --> 00:23:46.083
But the, at the level of a human level

00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:48.667
you can see how they depict

00:23:49.083 --> 00:23:52.000
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

00:23:52.458 --> 00:23:56.250
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

00:23:56.792 --> 00:23:59.667
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:02.291
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:03.834
They will exactly say

00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.999
what time which star will be coming nearer,

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:07.999
what star are today governing,

00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:10.333
tomorrow what will be the star there.

00:24:10.875 --> 00:24:15.166
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

00:24:15.667 --> 00:24:18.542
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

00:24:18.917 --> 00:24:21.667
at that time in these Western countries,

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:25.208
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

00:24:25.583 --> 00:24:31.625
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:38.375
So then all this arrangement was made,

00:24:38.375 --> 00:24:43.208
and human beings were made to understand

00:24:43.542 --> 00:24:47.083
that there is God.

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:52.667
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.834
real saints were respected,

00:24:55.208 --> 00:24:59.792
and they made different observations.

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:03.792
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

00:25:04.166 --> 00:25:07.917
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.125
He knows how My knee looks like,

00:25:11.417 --> 00:25:14.709
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:18.041
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:21.542
knows everything about Me.

00:25:21.792 --> 00:25:23.792
That means through his meditative power he could

00:25:24.208 --> 00:25:26.792
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:30.583
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

00:25:30.999 --> 00:25:34.542
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:39.583
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

00:25:39.917 --> 00:25:43.250
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:46.750
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.583
is there, is a fact.

00:25:50.125 --> 00:25:53.375
And it is the Knowledge of these people

00:25:53.709 --> 00:25:57.083
is most remarkable: how did they know that

00:25:57.417 --> 00:25:59.999
a Goddess is like that?

00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:03.333
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:08.041
but they are there, and they have described.

00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:10.166
It’s very surprising.

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:13.166
So their meditative power in India was great.

00:26:13.542 --> 00:26:18.500
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:21.291
people are disciplined.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.792
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:26.625
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:31.542
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:36.250
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

00:26:36.542 --> 00:26:40.208
and then sleep off – normally.

00:26:40.834 --> 00:26:42.583
Very disciplined.

00:26:42.917 --> 00:26:44.999
They don’t go on holidays,

00:26:45.333 --> 00:26:47.917
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:51.542
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:53.959
he’s thrown out of the house.

00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:57.333
He’s condemned as a leper.

00:26:57.709 --> 00:27:01.625
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:05.500
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:10.667
but they too, they hide their drinking.

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:13.500
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:17.083
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

00:27:17.333 --> 00:27:19.667
and people will start openly drinking,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.999
but normally they don’t.

00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:27.083
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:33.375
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

00:27:33.792 --> 00:27:38.458
Now, people could live in the jungles.

00:27:38.834 --> 00:27:41.458
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

00:27:41.709 --> 00:27:44.250
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

00:27:44.709 --> 00:27:47.999
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:51.041
otherwise you can’t get out.

00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:53.417
And you start from one place; reaching another place

00:27:53.792 --> 00:27:56.458
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.875
you get drenched.

00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:02.333
But this is not so in India.

00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:05.458
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

00:28:05.709 --> 00:28:07.834
in winter-time, you have seen it.

00:28:08.208 --> 00:28:11.083
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:13.000
at a wrong time.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:16.125
You can stay outside as long as you want.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.291
So these people could live in the jungles,

00:28:19.583 --> 00:28:24.041
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:27.417
In a simple little hut they could live:

00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:29.458
a little protection from the sun,

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:33.792
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:35.375
that’s all.

00:28:36.792 --> 00:28:40.083
And they had very little needs of life.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.333
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.792
there were no plastics that time, or even now

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.458
we don’t use plastics.

00:28:47.834 --> 00:28:52.000
And we used to have few thalis and things.

00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:55.500
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

00:28:55.834 --> 00:29:00.166
which were just permanently with the family.

00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:03.959
Now I find that such a difference there is.

00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:07.125
You see, in simple living what happens,

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:12.917
that you do not take out

00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:15.458
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

00:29:15.834 --> 00:29:17.959
There’s no ecological problem there.

00:29:18.458 --> 00:29:22.375
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.417
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

00:29:25.709 --> 00:29:31.750
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:34.999
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

00:29:35.375 --> 00:29:38.542
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

00:29:38.792 --> 00:29:43.166
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

00:29:43.542 --> 00:29:46.208
and such problems are there.

00:29:46.709 --> 00:29:50.458
So this Shakti that was working in those days

00:29:50.709 --> 00:29:56.041
was in them to make them seekers;

00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:59.458
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

00:29:59.458 --> 00:30:01.709
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:03.250
you have place to sleep,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.875
finished – not much to be done,

00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:09.500
living so happily.

00:30:09.875 --> 00:30:12.625
With all these

00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:18.583
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

00:30:18.999 --> 00:30:20.834
they had time, lot of time.

00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:26.125
And with that time, what did they do?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.917
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:34.583
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

00:30:34.959 --> 00:30:37.959
With that time they meditated.

00:30:38.291 --> 00:30:40.999
And when that time meditation started,

00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:46.750
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:50.208
what is Divinity, what is God.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.542
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:57.417
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

00:30:57.709 --> 00:31:00.792
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:04.125
It never comes to their head that

00:31:04.542 --> 00:31:06.834
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

00:31:07.041 --> 00:31:09.500
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:13.375
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.458
because you have come through Him?

00:31:15.834 --> 00:31:17.834
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:18.875
must be that.

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.542
And now when I told them these are His powers,

00:31:21.834 --> 00:31:23.542
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:26.625
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

00:31:26.959 --> 00:31:29.166
They are God.

00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:30.999
Nobody discusses these things.

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:33.667
God is – how can you understand God?

00:31:33.917 --> 00:31:36.333
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:39.917
Try – you can’t understand Me.

00:31:39.917 --> 00:31:41.999
Very difficult.

00:31:42.375 --> 00:31:44.667
So you can’t understand,

00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:46.500
you can’t understand God.

00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:48.458
Please understand one thing,

00:31:48.834 --> 00:31:51.917
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:53.959
But you can be in connection with God,

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.041
you can be in the company of God,

00:31:56.709 --> 00:31:57.999
you can be blessed by God,

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.375
you can be looked after by God,

00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:03.166
you can know lots of things about God;

00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:07.542
but you cannot understand.

00:32:08.792 --> 00:32:12.291
This is another thing one has to know,

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:16.333
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

00:32:16.709 --> 00:32:19.208
why He does this, why He does that.

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:22.250
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

00:32:22.792 --> 00:32:24.333
I mean, somebody can even say here,

00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:26.333
“Why did He make swastika?”

00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:28.250
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:30.959
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:35.375
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:37.250
They can go to that limit, you know,

00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:41.166
there’s nothing surprising.

00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:45.166
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.500
We think no end of ourselves,

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.458
we are very self-opinionated,

00:32:49.875 --> 00:32:52.458
and we do not know much about it.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.792
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

00:32:58.083 --> 00:33:00.917
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

00:33:01.375 --> 00:33:02.959
but still you will not understand God.

00:33:03.375 --> 00:33:06.917
You have to go above God to understand Him.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.959
How will you understand?

00:33:09.959 --> 00:33:11.667
Supposing there’s something below you,

00:33:11.667 --> 00:33:13.000
you can understand;

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:14.917
but something above you, how will you understand?

00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:17.917
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:19.917
and wants to understand about My house,

00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:23.333
will he understand?

00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:29.041
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.166
So the Source from which we have come,

00:33:32.709 --> 00:33:34.959
we cannot understand that.

00:33:35.291 --> 00:33:36.750
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:43.999
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

00:33:44.208 --> 00:33:46.083
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.291
we’ll be happy with that.

00:33:49.792 --> 00:33:52.917
And the power that is within you is Amba,

00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:55.875
is the desire power of God itself.

00:33:56.208 --> 00:33:57.583
So whatever your wish is, means that

00:33:58.417 --> 00:34:03.208
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:06.375
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:09.166
Then the Shakti makes you

00:34:09.709 --> 00:34:14.583
sit on different beautiful positions,

00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:18.417
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:21.999
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.083
in the Kingdom of God.

00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:28.417
Now you should assume your power.

00:34:28.917 --> 00:34:31.417
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:36.709
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

00:34:36.999 --> 00:34:38.250
where you must assume.

00:34:38.542 --> 00:34:40.542
I have told you many a times, now believe that

00:34:40.542 --> 00:34:42.792
you are Sahaja yogis.

00:34:42.792 --> 00:34:45.959
Believe that you are,

00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:48.917
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.834
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

00:34:51.834 --> 00:34:53.875
why She does that, why He does that.

00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:56.999
You cannot say that – that’s different.

00:34:57.291 --> 00:35:01.625
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:05.208
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

00:35:05.625 --> 00:35:08.875
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:35:09.291 --> 00:35:13.667
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:17.542
and made knowledgeable.

00:35:17.917 --> 00:35:21.125
But still this arrogance has to go down,

00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:25.125
that we can understand why it happens.

00:35:25.709 --> 00:35:29.500
That humility is very important for us;

00:35:29.834 --> 00:35:33.166
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:36.291
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

00:35:36.709 --> 00:35:39.959
now this power has to go higher and higher.

00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:44.999
For that, first you should be humble.

00:35:45.417 --> 00:35:47.875
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:52.750
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:56.709
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

00:35:57.208 --> 00:36:00.917
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.458
You are too great.

00:36:03.834 --> 00:36:08.834
But let us know ourselves.”

00:36:09.458 --> 00:36:11.875
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:14.625
like His own image.

00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:18.166
That means He has given you all the powers.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.834
He has made you.

00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:24.667
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:27.792
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:31.333
He has made you in His own image.

00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:37.834
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:40.375
These powers are with you.

00:36:40.999 --> 00:36:42.208
But the first thing you have to have,

00:36:42.583 --> 00:36:44.417
the discipline within yourself,

00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:46.333
that is missing.

00:36:46.792 --> 00:36:48.333
People cannot discipline themselves – means

00:36:48.709 --> 00:36:50.458
if they cannot control themselves,

00:36:50.792 --> 00:36:54.125
how can they control anyone?

00:36:56.166 --> 00:36:59.709
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:01.875
So the discipline should be that first

00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:04.999
you must see that you control yourself,

00:37:05.417 --> 00:37:09.542
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:13.083
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

00:37:13.417 --> 00:37:16.792
where they show a stupid man, you see?

00:37:17.667 --> 00:37:21.875
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:23.875
of the Goddess,

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:26.250
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:30.083
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.333
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:37.166
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.750
you want to sit on the sides,

00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:43.709
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:45.625
There’s no discipline.

00:37:46.083 --> 00:37:47.750
You have to have the discipline.

00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:49.542
Where are you sitting?

00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:52.083
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

00:37:52.542 --> 00:37:53.999
So you should have that dignity,

00:37:54.542 --> 00:37:55.999
you should have that affection,

00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:57.999
you should have that compassion,

00:37:58.333 --> 00:38:02.667
you must have that love, and the dedication.

00:38:02.999 --> 00:38:05.542
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

00:38:05.917 --> 00:38:09.083
because you are the vehicle of that power.

00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:13.250
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

00:38:13.709 --> 00:38:16.166
which is emptied inside.

00:38:16.458 --> 00:38:17.959
If it is already full with ego,

00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:20.500
what can you put inside that?

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:23.417
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:31.500
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:34.208
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:40.999
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.917
or whatever it is, only that,

00:38:45.208 --> 00:38:48.250
then you cannot rise very high.

00:38:48.709 --> 00:38:50.917
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

00:38:51.583 --> 00:38:55.166
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

00:38:55.709 --> 00:39:01.542
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

00:39:02.041 --> 00:39:04.083
Then the desire of God will work.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.083
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.750
of God,

00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:12.625
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:18.208
but is the one which will fulfill your

00:39:18.542 --> 00:39:20.542
complete so-called desires,

00:39:21.208 --> 00:39:23.208
without even your Knowledge.

00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:26.542
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

00:39:26.834 --> 00:39:29.583
that now we do not know how to compile the book

00:39:29.917 --> 00:39:31.125
even on miracles.

00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:33.375
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

00:39:33.917 --> 00:39:35.291
realized souls.

00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:39.166
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

00:39:39.709 --> 00:39:43.083
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

00:39:43.542 --> 00:39:45.166
now what is my situation?

00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:48.667
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

00:39:48.999 --> 00:39:54.166
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.750
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

00:39:57.125 --> 00:39:59.458
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.709
you have known something which is tangible,

00:40:02.125 --> 00:40:04.208
you have got the experience of it.

00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:08.959
Still you are not surrendered.

00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:11.500
If you surrender to the will of God,

00:40:11.834 --> 00:40:14.250
then everything is taken charge.

00:40:14.625 --> 00:40:17.166
It will never let you down, no question;

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.166
and everything, all things which look like

00:40:20.542 --> 00:40:23.875
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.750
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:32.083
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

00:40:32.458 --> 00:40:35.291
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:42.000
by the people from a country which is discipline

00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:47.375
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:54.125
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.709
For example, they have a military:

00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:04.625
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:05.959
to attack?

00:41:06.542 --> 00:41:07.667
No one.

00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:09.417
Why do they have military?

00:41:09.875 --> 00:41:11.625
And compulsory military, do you know that?

00:41:11.917 --> 00:41:13.625
Because they have looted other people’s money and

00:41:13.999 --> 00:41:16.917
kept them there, like thugs.

00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:19.000
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:22.375
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:31.583
demand the money, and may start using the power

00:41:31.834 --> 00:41:33.375
of destruction on us.

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.500
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:40.542
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:42.834
There is no need to have any military there.

00:41:42.834 --> 00:41:45.208
But everybody has to go to military

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.875
and join the military,

00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:54.917
because they are thieves of the worst type.

00:41:55.792 --> 00:41:59.458
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:01.709
of the watch, which human beings have made,

00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:04.250
God has not made.

00:42:04.792 --> 00:42:07.041
So the watch is important, because they are

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.041
making watches.

00:42:10.458 --> 00:42:13.375
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:18.583
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

00:42:18.959 --> 00:42:21.083
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:22.834
and the way you are?”

00:42:23.083 --> 00:42:24.875
So they are very disciplined.

00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:28.375
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.750
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

00:42:31.083 --> 00:42:35.999
too much of cleanliness in them.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.125
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

00:42:39.583 --> 00:42:42.709
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

00:42:43.041 --> 00:42:45.041
were married from Switzerland,

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.709
and the reports have come that

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.709
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.625
or bar-maids.”

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.417
So I said, “Why?”

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:54.250
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:56.291
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

00:42:56.875 --> 00:42:59.208
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

00:42:59.542 --> 00:43:01.625
you see the guests are sitting

00:43:01.625 --> 00:43:02.999
and they have no time to talk.

00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:04.875
There’s no question of talking to each other,

00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:06.083
there’s nothing;

00:43:06.875 --> 00:43:08.125
all the time they are worried about

00:43:08.583 --> 00:43:09.792
this thing, this is getting dirty,

00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:13.083
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.375
Can you imagine?

00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:17.792
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:19.166
that they have.

00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:24.041
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.166
Nature is not like that.

00:43:26.542 --> 00:43:28.750
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:32.750
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:35.041
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:39.291
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:42.917
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

00:43:43.417 --> 00:43:46.333
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

00:43:46.709 --> 00:43:47.999
a little leisure.

00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:50.083
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

00:43:50.375 --> 00:43:51.709
so clean the house.

00:43:52.083 --> 00:43:53.208
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.166
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

00:43:56.625 --> 00:44:02.625
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

00:44:03.625 --> 00:44:05.500
And who can love such a woman

00:44:05.875 --> 00:44:11.750
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:22.125
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

00:44:22.542 --> 00:44:25.333
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

00:44:25.709 --> 00:44:30.250
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.709
that in England –

00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:35.959
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

00:44:36.458 --> 00:44:38.834
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:43.250
and that is going too far.

00:44:43.583 --> 00:44:47.250
So this is in between one has to be.

00:44:47.709 --> 00:44:51.999
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

00:44:52.208 --> 00:44:55.917
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

00:44:56.417 --> 00:44:58.166
So cleanliness has to be there.

00:44:58.583 --> 00:44:59.458
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

00:44:59.959 --> 00:45:01.000
but it should not be that

00:45:01.375 --> 00:45:04.250
everybody should be panicked about it;

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.834
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:12.417
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:15.041
to meditate.

00:45:15.041 --> 00:45:17.250
Even meditating they will be seeing round

00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:19.750
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

00:45:20.166 --> 00:45:21.999
and they will go and pick up.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.959
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

00:45:25.166 --> 00:45:26.083
start doing that!

00:45:27.375 --> 00:45:31.542
There’s no discipline of meditation,

00:45:31.959 --> 00:45:35.999
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:41.959
discipline of following the will of God –

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:44.417
that’s not there.

00:45:44.999 --> 00:45:47.291
Unless and that discipline comes many,

00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:51.417
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:57.999
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:02.917
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:05.834
of meditation.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:11.250
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

00:46:11.625 --> 00:46:12.834
She knows your past,

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:15.875
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

00:46:15.875 --> 00:46:19.125
Once you start introspecting

00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:21.375
and seeing it within yourself,

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.500
“what is wrong with me?”

00:46:24.999 --> 00:46:28.375
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

00:46:28.834 --> 00:46:30.208
“what have I to do?” –

00:46:30.667 --> 00:46:34.542
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:39.542
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

00:46:39.917 --> 00:46:41.917
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:45.083
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

00:46:45.583 --> 00:46:49.500
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:53.000
You must meditate, and the meditation

00:46:53.375 --> 00:46:55.583
should be little bit in the morning

00:46:55.917 --> 00:46:57.750
and little bit in the evening.

00:46:58.166 --> 00:47:01.792
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.667
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:11.667
It takes hardly any time.

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:13.208
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

00:47:13.625 --> 00:47:16.999
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

00:47:17.333 --> 00:47:20.542
if you can give for your meditation,

00:47:20.917 --> 00:47:23.667
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:26.792
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

00:47:27.125 --> 00:47:29.999
will improve, everything will work out.

00:47:30.208 --> 00:47:32.792
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.834
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

00:47:36.458 --> 00:47:39.500
your body itself will be full of perfume.

00:47:39.959 --> 00:47:41.500
Everything will be supplied.

00:47:41.917 --> 00:47:45.834
So what we have to do is to first of all see

00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:49.291
a surrender to the will of the God.

00:47:49.625 --> 00:47:52.750
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

00:47:52.999 --> 00:47:55.959
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

00:47:56.166 --> 00:47:58.333
You surrender your problems also.

00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:01.041
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

00:48:01.417 --> 00:48:05.000
You do this.”

00:48:05.458 --> 00:48:09.250
It is such a precise, such an effective,

00:48:09.583 --> 00:48:15.333
such an efficient Power.

00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:22.709
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

00:48:23.041 --> 00:48:24.250
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:26.250
“All right, it will be all right.”

00:48:26.625 --> 00:48:29.125
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.250
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:38.999
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

00:48:39.542 --> 00:48:43.458
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

00:48:43.917 --> 00:48:46.417
which is the most important for all of you,

00:48:47.208 --> 00:48:53.792
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.000
And by its activity you should know it is become

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.125
very powerful,

00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:04.959
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

00:49:05.625 --> 00:49:09.375
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

00:49:09.959 --> 00:49:12.250
It will take care of it.

00:49:13.166 --> 00:49:15.834
All wrong things you have done,

00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:18.291
all bad karmas you have done,

00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:22.917
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:25.583
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.709
you are not on that level.

00:49:27.709 --> 00:49:30.291
Like we can say that ordinary people

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.917
can be charged with criminality,

00:49:33.291 --> 00:49:37.542
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

00:49:37.917 --> 00:49:40.083
then nobody can charge you.

00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:42.417
You are above the law.

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:45.667
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.208
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

00:49:49.834 --> 00:49:53.125
nobody can hamper your progress.

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.250
Only it is you who can do it.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.625
And nobody can harm Me,

00:49:59.959 --> 00:50:02.375
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

00:50:02.875 --> 00:50:07.041
But it is you who can harm Me;

00:50:07.625 --> 00:50:11.959
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

00:50:12.291 --> 00:50:16.083
and I am working it out in My body,

00:50:16.542 --> 00:50:19.875
everything, your cleansing, everything,

00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.125
which is a difficult task.

00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:24.083
But in the beginning only,

00:50:24.375 --> 00:50:27.208
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

00:50:27.667 --> 00:50:29.667
“you must have the Knowledge.”

00:50:29.667 --> 00:50:33.333
So that promise has to be fulfilled

00:50:33.667 --> 00:50:34.917
and that has to be done,

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:36.834
though it’s a very hazardous task.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.917
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

00:50:40.333 --> 00:50:43.834
to make people understand

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.583
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:51.000
it’s a very difficult task.

00:50:51.417 --> 00:50:52.834
They talk of big, big things.

00:50:53.291 --> 00:50:54.500
I have seen people write articles nowadays

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:56.999
that nothing is substantial,

00:50:57.542 --> 00:51:02.667
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

00:51:03.041 --> 00:51:05.875
All these big, big books they are writing.

00:51:06.417 --> 00:51:08.417
But if you write to them now that we have found out

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:11.333
something, they don’t want to see you.

00:51:11.792 --> 00:51:13.083
They don’t want to meet you.

00:51:13.583 --> 00:51:15.083
They have nothing to do with it.

00:51:15.667 --> 00:51:17.000
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

00:51:17.542 --> 00:51:21.208
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

00:51:21.792 --> 00:51:24.125
What are they seeking?

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.458
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.375
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

00:51:28.834 --> 00:51:31.500
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

00:51:31.834 --> 00:51:34.125
you have no destination.

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.291
In the same way they are without any destination,

00:51:37.875 --> 00:51:39.667
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

00:51:39.959 --> 00:51:45.166
we are doing that” – without any destination,

00:51:45.875 --> 00:51:46.083
without any understanding,

00:51:46.458 --> 00:51:47.750
without any meaning to their life,

00:51:48.125 --> 00:51:49.999
absolutely useless people.

00:51:50.417 --> 00:51:51.917
They are worth nothing.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.999
We have to try as much as possible

00:51:54.375 --> 00:51:55.792
how many we can save;

00:51:56.125 --> 00:51:57.625
but those who do not want to come,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.709
there’s no need,

00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:02.417
there's no need for us.

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.583
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

00:52:06.041 --> 00:52:08.500
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

00:52:08.834 --> 00:52:10.208
then only we’ll have.

00:52:11.083 --> 00:52:12.291
I never write any letter to anyone,

00:52:12.667 --> 00:52:14.291
“Please come to My program.”

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.792
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

00:52:17.083 --> 00:52:20.875
musicians and all that; I never write.

00:52:21.208 --> 00:52:22.875
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

00:52:23.333 --> 00:52:25.542
if you want to come you can come.

00:52:25.875 --> 00:52:29.333
This advertisement also I was not willing.

00:52:31.125 --> 00:52:34.917
So you can imagine that

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:41.500
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

00:52:41.917 --> 00:52:46.500
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

00:52:46.999 --> 00:52:49.375
And you have the Knowledge.

00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:51.999
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.166
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

00:52:55.667 --> 00:52:57.999
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

00:52:58.792 --> 00:53:02.417
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

00:53:02.917 --> 00:53:07.000
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

00:53:07.792 --> 00:53:10.999
She created you for this purpose,

00:53:11.458 --> 00:53:13.959
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

00:53:14.458 --> 00:53:16.959
level for this purpose,

00:53:17.458 --> 00:53:19.583
and that is what you have to do it.

00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:25.750
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:27.291
then know that

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:33.709
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

00:53:34.208 --> 00:53:39.583
And unless and until you people rise to that level

00:53:39.959 --> 00:53:42.834
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

00:53:43.208 --> 00:53:45.458
like some people are still smoking,

00:53:45.709 --> 00:53:48.500
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.834
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

00:53:51.041 --> 00:53:54.999
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

00:53:55.375 --> 00:53:57.875
useless people, where will they go?

00:53:58.417 --> 00:54:00.625
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

00:54:01.041 --> 00:54:04.917
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

00:54:05.417 --> 00:54:07.333
so what is going to happen to them?

00:54:07.667 --> 00:54:08.750
But all this is available to you;

00:54:09.083 --> 00:54:10.000
only thing you must know

00:54:10.417 --> 00:54:14.083
how to control yourself, control your senses.

00:54:14.458 --> 00:54:18.000
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

00:54:18.375 --> 00:54:21.000
If we cannot control our own horses,

00:54:21.375 --> 00:54:26.917
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:30.250
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

00:54:30.625 --> 00:54:34.500
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

00:54:34.959 --> 00:54:37.875
and you have to give it to others.

00:54:38.291 --> 00:54:42.917
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:45.792
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

00:54:46.417 --> 00:54:51.667
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

00:54:51.999 --> 00:54:54.709
God. How beautiful it is.

00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:58.125
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

00:54:58.458 --> 00:55:03.333
God for such a great purpose.”

00:55:03.709 --> 00:55:06.000
You are molded, you are made like that

00:55:06.458 --> 00:55:09.709
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

00:55:10.125 --> 00:55:13.999
and with this free will you have to rise.

00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:16.542
With this free will you have to understand

00:55:16.999 --> 00:55:22.625
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:33.667
It is nature’s reaction to things.

00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:36.959
Always nature reacts to human beings.

00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:41.250
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

00:55:41.583 --> 00:55:44.125
and when the reaction of the God comes in

00:55:44.709 --> 00:55:47.625
then we find all these things happening.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.999
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

00:55:51.417 --> 00:55:55.625
which is very, very well explaining why all these

00:55:55.959 --> 00:56:01.041
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

00:56:01.417 --> 00:56:04.417
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

00:56:04.917 --> 00:56:07.417
and listen to it again and again.

00:56:07.792 --> 00:56:11.208
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

00:56:11.542 --> 00:56:13.834
but should be something you should try to understand.

00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:17.041
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

00:56:17.458 --> 00:56:19.709
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:22.750
which none of them have said so far.

00:56:23.333 --> 00:56:25.166
Because you have got your realization,

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:30.500
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

00:56:30.875 --> 00:56:39.625
May God bless you.
