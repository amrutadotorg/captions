1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:02,730
00:01:16:27 00:01:21:09 First, I will speak
in Hindi language and then in English.

2
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:25,090
00:01:21:13 00:01:25:02 We are such a cosmopolitan
people

3
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:32,980
00:01:25:06 00:01:28:23 that I don’t know
what language to take to.

4
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:46,560
00:01:48:28 00:01:51:13 [Shri Mataji speaks
in Hindi]

5
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:58,850
00:22:47:11 00:22:51:21 I am talking to them
about Shiva’s worship -

6
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,320
00:22:51:29 00:22:54:05 what should happen
to you.

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,009
00:22:54:11 00:22:56:23 But today, I am going
to tell you about

8
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:25,580
00:22:56:27 00:22:59:09 the internal happening
within us

9
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:33,490
00:22:59:17 00:23:02:13 when you get your
Realization.

10
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:42,190
00:23:02:22 00:23:07:23 There are eleven rudras
placed here – eleven of them.

11
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:50,600
00:23:08:03 00:23:12:07 They are particles,
we can say, anshas they call it,

12
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,019
00:23:12:15 00:23:15:13 of Shiva’s powers.

13
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:03,849
00:23:15:23 00:23:21:18 And all of them try
to take out

14
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:16,940
00:23:21:29 00:23:27:18 or to remove all the
false ideas we have about life.

15
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:26,700
00:23:28:05 00:23:33:23 When the Kundalini
rises, they all get enlightened - eleven of

16
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
them.

17
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:38,599
00:23:34:04 00:23:36:03 And, say for example,
00:23:36:09 00:23:41:01 Buddha had a part

18
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,920
of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

19
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:58,489
00:23:41:18 00:23:47:07 Now, all of them,
what they do is to control us

20
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:09,950
00:23:47:17 00:23:52:05 from falling into
the prey of various things.

21
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:17,180
00:23:52:15 00:23:55:03 Like, we have an ego.

22
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:25,350
00:23:55:10 00:23:58:23 So, Buddha will look
after the ego part.

23
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:33,850
00:23:59:01 00:24:04:11 He will see that you
get shocked by your ego.

24
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,230
00:24:04:22 00:24:07:00 You will be quite
amazed

25
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,280
00:24:07:06 00:24:11:10 how you could be so
egoistical,

26
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,090
00:24:11:19 00:24:16:16 and so insulting,
and so humiliating.

27
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,330
00:24:16:28 00:24:22:17 But when this rudra
is not awakened,

28
00:04:51,330 --> 00:05:03,910
00:24:22:25 00:24:28:13 when there is no light
in this rudra, then what happens?

29
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:09,620
00:24:28:23 00:24:30:21 You start justifying
yourself.

30
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:19,160
00:24:30:28 00:24:33:03 You think whatever
you do is correct,

31
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:28,700
00:24:33:11 00:24:35:24 whatever you’ve
done, whatever you’ve said,

32
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:35,850
00:24:36:00 00:24:40:10 whatever you have
achieved,

33
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,900
00:24:40:18 00:24:42:16 you think is your
right.

34
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,020
00:24:42:23 00:24:44:24 You’ve done nothing
wrong.

35
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,740
00:24:45:01 00:24:51:01 For that, this Buddha’s
rudra has to be awakened.

36
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:59,280
00:24:52:09 00:24:56:19 On the contrary, if
you go on pampering your ego,

37
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,979
00:24:56:28 00:25:00:11 if you go on becoming
egoistical,

38
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:12,680
00:25:00:18 00:25:04:27 you become absolutely
a right-sided personality.

39
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,280
00:25:05:05 00:25:06:25 Once you are a right-sided
personality,

40
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:28,800
00:25:07:03 00:25:11:22 you know what all
the symptoms there are of such a person.

41
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:37,880
00:25:11:28 00:25:14:16 Now, for that if you
just watch

42
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:45,979
00:25:14:23 00:25:19:27 and introspect and
see for yourself what ego has done to you,

43
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,750
00:25:20:05 00:25:23:27 what wrong ideas you
had about yourself.

44
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:59,330
00:25:24:09 00:25:28:05 So that’s why Mohammed
Saheb has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.”

45
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,259
00:25:28:16 00:25:31:11 He didn’t know what
else to tell.

46
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:11,860
00:25:31:18 00:25:37:18 Because this ego business
can really burst you,

47
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:21,300
00:25:38:00 00:25:43:06 your head completely,
and you may land up into so many difficulties.

48
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:29,190
00:25:43:13 00:25:49:04 Ultimately, I have
seen people developing this yuppie’s disease

49
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,560
00:25:49:12 00:25:55:11 where the conscious
mind becomes absolutely useless,

50
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,050
00:25:55:27 00:25:58:01 cannot move.

51
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,790
00:25:58:09 00:26:00:21 Consciously people
cannot move.

52
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,230
00:26:00:28 00:26:05:00 Unconsciously they
will, but not consciously.

53
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,490
00:26:05:12 00:26:08:18 And this disease is
so horrible.

54
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,650
A person becomes like a reptile.
00:26:08:25 00:26:11:29 You have to carry

55
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,160
them on your body.

56
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,919
They can’t walk on their own.

57
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,930
00:26:12:06 00:26:15:12 They can’t sit on
their own.

58
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,199
00:26:15:29 00:26:19:09 In a very young age
this can happen.

59
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,330
This is happening in America.

60
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,599
00:26:19:15 00:26:22:10 Also, I have seen
two, three cases here,

61
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:26,240
00:26:22:17 00:26:24:23 in India, also such
a thing happened.

62
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:38,120
00:26:25:00 00:26:29:21 So if you do not try
to see your ego and control it,

63
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,000
00:26:29:28 00:26:33:28 and feel repentant
about it.

64
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,899
00:26:34:27 00:26:36:24 In Sahaja Yoga, there
is nothing like repentance,

65
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,779
00:26:37:00 00:26:38:18 we don’t believe
in repentance.

66
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,450
00:26:38:24 00:26:42:10 Because we believe
that you all have got your Realization,

67
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,940
00:26:42:16 00:26:47:13 you are beyond any
mistakes.

68
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,399
It’s not true.

69
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,240
00:26:49:12 00:26:51:21 We have to repent.
00:26:51:28 00:26:53:28 There’s a, in English,

70
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,470
there is a word – sorry.

71
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,519
00:26:54:05 00:26:55:19 Sorry, for everything
they will say sorry.

72
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,700
00:26:55:25 00:26:57:27 Even telephone if
you pick up, they’ll say, “sorry.”

73
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,630
00:26:58:04 00:27:01:07 I say, “Sorry, for
what?”

74
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:31,269
00:27:01:18 00:27:05:07 But this sorry itself
is very empty.

75
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,839
00:27:05:13 00:27:08:23 It has no meaning.

76
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,220
It has no depth.

77
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:45,519
00:27:09:00 00:27:13:05 When you say “sorry,”
you have to see why you are saying “sorry,”

78
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,110
00:27:13:12 00:27:16:00 and what is to be
corrected.

79
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,660
00:27:16:07 00:27:20:13 This is a very big
problem of today’s generation

80
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,660
00:27:20:21 00:27:23:29 where people have
developed such tremendous ego-

81
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,890
00:27:24:05 00:27:27:16 because all our economic
growth,

82
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,470
00:27:27:23 00:27:32:00 all our industrial
developments,

83
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:09,079
00:27:32:10 00:27:36:00 all our big, big organizations,
00:27:36:07 00:27:40:25 all of them have given

84
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,830
us a way
00:27:41:03 00:27:43:10 that we should all

85
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,830
develop our ego.

86
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,899
00:27:43:17 00:27:47:28 If we don’t develop
our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere.

87
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,930
00:27:48:05 00:27:50:13 And that’s how we
start pampering it,

88
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,399
00:27:50:21 00:27:55:19 and then this right-sided
problem starts.

89
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,450
00:27:56:29 00:28:00:07 Then as a reaction,
it goes to the left side.

90
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:40,250
00:28:01:04 00:28:03:17 Actually, in the head
it is on the right side.

91
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,480
00:28:03:23 00:28:07:04 Here is the right
side ego comes up,

92
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,580
00:28:07:11 00:28:12:03 so the left rudra
is that of Mahavira.

93
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,030
00:28:14:06 00:28:19:00 So people do things,
which are sinful,

94
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:59,730
00:28:19:27 00:28:24:22 which are wrong, which
are against Shri Ganesha.

95
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:08,980
00:28:25:28 00:28:30:21 Then also there are
controlling powers of Mahavira, who controls.

96
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:17,680
00:28:30:27 00:28:33:29 He says, “You will
go to hell; this will happen,”

97
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:24,220
00:28:34:06 00:28:36:28 he describes all the
hell, all kinds of hell,

98
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,420
00:28:37:06 00:28:40:07 that you’ll go to
hell and you’ll be burnt alive -

99
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:35,709
00:28:40:15 00:28:44:19 I don’t know, all
kinds of things He describes to frighten you.

100
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,709
00:28:45:04 00:28:48:09 But that doesn’t
help.

101
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,480
00:28:48:24 00:28:52:15 So people start getting
more onto the left side

102
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,610
00:28:52:22 00:28:53:25 and, I should say,
00:28:54:03 00:28:57:19 through this rudra,

103
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:53,090
when this rudra gets helpless,
00:28:57:27 00:29:01:22 then a tremendous

104
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,030
depression comes in.

105
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,920
00:29:02:05 00:29:05:18 One feels very depressed.

106
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,210
“Oh God.

107
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,750
00:29:05:27 00:29:09:25 What a depression
I have.

108
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,340
I am so sick.

109
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,930
I am this thing.”

110
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:17,700
00:29:10:03 00:29:15:09 And then you try to
frighten others with your depressions.

111
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:25,200
00:29:15:22 00:29:20:03 You show sort of a,
what you call, an emotional blackmail you

112
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
do.

113
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,550
00:29:20:16 00:29:22:13 All kinds of things
you will do,

114
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:36,690
00:29:22:19 00:29:25:29 and beat your head
and do all kinds of things.

115
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,110
00:29:26:06 00:29:29:06 Could be through ego,
could be through

116
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,579
00:29:29:12 00:29:37:11 this left side problem
of the left rudra.

117
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:50,440
00:29:37:25 00:29:40:27 These two rudras are
very important

118
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,730
00:29:41:06 00:29:44:03 because they are directly
connected with our

119
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,730
00:29:44:10 00:29:48:01 left and right sympathetic
nervous system.

120
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:07,220
00:29:48:10 00:29:49:19 So, it’s very important
to see

121
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,320
00:29:49:25 00:29:54:16 that you don’t fall
a prey to these rudras.

122
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,100
00:29:54:24 00:29:57:22 These rudras are to
be satisfied.

123
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:25,610
00:29:58:00 00:30:02:25 So to be normal, at
least look after these two rudras, which are:

124
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,149
00:30:03:01 00:30:08:25 one is the one who
controls the ego, and another is self-pity.

125
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,149
00:30:09:09 00:30:13:22 “I just can’t
do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of

126
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:34,149
depression.

127
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:36,820
00:30:13:29 00:30:18:25 All this works out
00:30:19:03 00:30:23:25 into, physically also,

128
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,720
into very serious problems like cancer.

129
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,449
00:30:24:05 00:30:27:18 If the rudras are
caught up, you develop cancer.

130
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,190
00:30:27:24 00:30:32:12 But all this portion
gets swollen up.

131
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,250
It’s called as the medha.
00:30:32:21 00:30:34:29 This all portion gets

132
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,670
swollen up,
00:30:35:07 00:30:39:25 and you can see a

133
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,110
cancer patient having a swelling all over.

134
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,019
00:30:40:03 00:30:43:01 At least would be
here, or maybe there.

135
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:05,360
00:30:43:09 00:30:46:19 Because such a swing
in the nature of a person

136
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,329
00:30:46:28 00:30:48:00 that you can’t say
00:30:48:07 00:30:52:21 from which rudra they

137
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,459
have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

138
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:14,720
00:30:52:29 00:30:55:28 Psychosomatic troubles,
all of them, come

139
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,459
00:30:56:04 00:31:00:29 because the rudras
have become ineffective.

140
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:24,620
00:31:01:12 00:31:07:12 It can be due to the
depressive nature

141
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,030
00:31:07:28 00:31:11:18 or oppressive nature.

142
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,360
00:31:11:28 00:31:15:04 It could be due to
many other factors also.

143
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,220
00:31:15:10 00:31:18:01 But all these factors
are nothing

144
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,620
00:31:18:09 00:31:25:19 but part and parcel
of Shri Shiva’s,

145
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,620
00:31:25:27 00:31:28:25 or Sadashiva’s powers.

146
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:44,120
00:31:29:04 00:31:35:10 He is the one who
is full of karuna - full of compassion.

147
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,990
00:31:35:16 00:31:38:22 He is the ocean of
compassion.

148
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,220
00:31:38:29 00:31:42:06 If you ask Him forgiveness,
He'll forgive.

149
00:14:51,220 --> 00:15:00,470
00:31:42:13 00:31:47:05 Whatever you do, instead
of feeling guilty if you ask forgiveness,

150
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:06,339
00:31:47:12 00:31:49:09 then He forgives.
00:31:49:18 00:31:52:16 But if you think you,

151
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:12,440
whatever you have done is good,
00:31:52:22 00:31:57:28 you’ve never tortured

152
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,040
anybody, you have never made anybody suffer,
00:31:58:11 00:32:00:28 then it knows.

153
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,750
00:32:01:25 00:32:04:05 Shiva knows everything,
isn’t it?

154
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,610
00:32:04:13 00:32:08:03 And, because it knows,
it starts giving up.

155
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,200
00:32:08:10 00:32:14:07 So there’s a big
combination of your willpower

156
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,949
00:32:14:15 00:32:19:03 to be there, and the
combination of the blessings of Shiva.

157
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,220
00:32:19:11 00:32:22:22 When the Shiva blesses
you,

158
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,680
00:32:23:01 00:32:26:03 your willpower also
heightens.

159
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,509
00:32:26:10 00:32:30:12 But you must have
full willpower

160
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:49,380
00:32:30:23 00:32:32:10 to know that you have
00:32:32:17 00:32:38:07 to be of a higher

161
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,390
level of personality.

162
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,529
00:32:39:03 00:32:41:29 He was not at all
a mundane type.

163
00:15:54,529 --> 00:16:02,060
00:32:42:05 00:32:43:15 I mean He was…
00:32:43:21 00:32:47:10 supposing, ask Shiva

164
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:09,010
to go to some party and all that,
00:32:47:16 00:32:49:11 how will He look there?

165
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,040
00:32:49:17 00:32:51:11 People will laugh
at Him.

166
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,209
00:32:51:18 00:32:52:24 When I met some hippies,
I said,

167
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:23,450
00:32:53:00 00:32:55:09 “Why are you having
this kind of hair?”

168
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:29,589
00:32:55:16 00:32:58:03 So they said, “We
want to -” they are all primitive -

169
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,709
00:32:58:10 00:33:00:06 so he said, “I want
to be primitive.”

170
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,260
00:33:00:15 00:33:01:28 I said, “But the
brain is modern.

171
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,660
00:33:02:04 00:33:05:28 What’s the use of
having primitive hair?”

172
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,320
00:33:06:07 00:33:11:07 So, deception.

173
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,130
Deceiving yourself is not going to help.

174
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:55,070
00:33:11:13 00:33:14:24 Best thing is to face
yourself and understand

175
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,480
00:33:15:00 00:33:17:23 what wrong you have
been doing.

176
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,410
00:33:18:01 00:33:19:17 If it works out, I
tell you,

177
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,439
00:33:19:23 00:33:22:17 so many Sahaja Yogis
you are sitting here.

178
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:18,309
00:33:22:24 00:33:26:06 If you correct yourself
and become that

179
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:25,199
00:33:26:13 00:33:30:01 I am sure all the
problems - political, economic,

180
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,350
00:33:30:07 00:33:34:03 and all stupid problems
we have - will be finished.

181
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,130
00:33:34:12 00:33:37:13 But today it’s such
a mixture, due to Kali Yuga,

182
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:46,880
00:33:37:19 00:33:43:18 that even the worst
people are carrying on.

183
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,710
00:33:43:28 00:33:49:01 Now, we have a responsibility
to save this world.

184
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:59,070
00:33:49:09 00:33:55:06 We have a responsibility
to create a great, honorable life,

185
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,960
00:33:55:13 00:33:58:17 which is not superficial,
which is not just to show off.

186
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,400
00:33:58:23 00:34:01:11 But inside it should
develop

187
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,240
00:34:01:18 00:34:07:17 so that this light
of your spirit spreads

188
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,410
00:34:07:27 00:34:10:07 and enlightens this
world.

189
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,100
00:34:10:17 00:34:12:21 It’s very important
to understand

190
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,790
00:34:12:27 00:34:14:17 all these troubles
and these,

191
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,000
00:34:14:23 00:34:17:17 I should say, diseases,
psychosomatic diseases,

192
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,850
00:34:17:24 00:34:22:03 and all other problems
which are,in a collective way we can call,

193
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,710
00:34:22:09 00:34:28:06 of the Kali Yuga like
political, economic, all these problems -

194
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,590
00:34:28:13 00:34:32:05 only are created by
human beings.

195
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,960
00:34:32:16 00:34:35:12 They're not created
by the Divine Force.

196
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,690
00:34:35:19 00:34:39:25 But Divine Force tries
to neutralize them

197
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,880
00:34:40:04 00:34:43:13 if there are many
Sahaja Yogis

198
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,320
00:34:43:21 00:34:48:25 who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word.

199
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,580
00:34:49:13 00:34:55:11 If that could be done,
if that could be achieved,

200
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,289
00:34:57:12 00:35:00:04 then I think we can
do a lot,

201
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,539
00:35:00:11 00:35:03:13 a lot for the betterment
of humanity,

202
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:26,020
00:35:03:21 00:35:05:24 and that’s why we
have got realization.

203
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,809
00:35:06:03 00:35:11:03 It’s not only for
yourself, it’s not only for your family,

204
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:36,630
00:35:11:10 00:35:13:10 it’s not only for
your city or country,

205
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:49,040
00:35:13:16 00:35:18:00 but for the whole
world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

206
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:56,530
00:35:18:09 00:35:20:09 Now, if you have to
do competition,

207
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:03,510
00:35:20:16 00:35:25:11 you must only do competition
in your ascent and in nothing else.

208
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,640
00:35:25:18 00:35:27:28 But people are so
superficial

209
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,440
00:35:28:05 00:35:30:24 that they think by
showing off

210
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,120
00:35:31:00 00:35:34:13 or by becoming something
– a big Johnny -

211
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:28,179
00:35:34:23 00:35:39:25 they will achieve
something of a very great level, is not so.

212
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:54,500
00:35:40:10 00:35:46:10 It has to be a very
humble attitude towards yourself also,

213
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:37,520
00:35:46:28 00:35:50:10 so that you understand
that whatever you are doing

214
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:52,820
00:35:50:18 00:35:52:06 is 

215
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:03,030
for the betterment
00:35:52:13 00:35:58:06 of global problems.

216
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:20,240
00:35:58:17 00:36:04:05 Absolutely we can
solve because you are 

217
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:28,990
the channels of the Divine.
00:36:04:12 00:36:06:11 If I could do it alone,

218
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,680
I would have done it.

219
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:41,840
00:36:06:18 00:36:09:27 But I can’t, so
that’s why I had to gather you all

220
00:22:41,840 --> 00:23:21,210
00:36:10:03 00:36:13:04 and to tell you that
you 

221
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:24,520
become all the channels.

222
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,610
00:36:13:10 00:36:15:22 But in the meanwhile,
you enjoy.

223
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,270
00:36:15:29 00:36:21:11 You enjoy life.

224
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:41,730
Every second becomes a joy,
00:36:21:19 00:36:24:18 which is also the

225
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:50,100
gift of Shiva.
00:36:24:25 00:36:27:18 Shiva is the one who

226
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,460
creates this
00:36:27:27 00:36:30:29 great admiration

227
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,940
00:36:31:06 00:36:36:12 and great appreciation
of every moment,

228
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:05,970
00:36:36:19 00:36:38:21 everything that is
there.

229
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:30,230
00:36:38:29 00:36:42:00 And 
that is the state we have to achieve,

230
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:42,430
00:36:42:06 00:36:44:11 by not condemning
yourself,

231
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:58,450
00:36:44:18 00:36:50:17 or not by pampering
your ego,

232
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:07,370
00:36:50:24 00:36:53:17 but by seeing what
you are.

233
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:13,580
00:36:53:25 00:36:57:28 That’s the main
thing one has to see, is what problem you

234
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:21,280
have,
00:36:58:05 00:37:02:07 and what is troubling

235
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:29,010
you is yourself only.

236
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:44,210
00:37:02:19 00:37:07:05 If you could just
come to that point of understanding,

237
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:57,910
00:37:07:15 00:37:10:24 I am sure, I am very,
very sure

238
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:15,850
00:37:11:01 00:37:15:16 that you will be such
an asset

239
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:32,000
00:37:15:25 00:37:21:24 to help to make this
world look at itself and change.

240
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:41,320
00:37:22:01 00:37:27:09 Because superficially
you cannot change such deep-rooted problems.

241
00:26:41,320 --> 00:29:05,179
00:37:27:15 00:37:31:22 And, you are being
so blessed by Kundalini

242
00:29:05,179 --> 00:30:20,700
00:37:32:00 00:37:37:24 that you 
can 

243
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:36,690
really become a great
00:37:38:07 00:37:39:29 torch, I should say,

244
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:48,830
00:37:40:05 00:37:46:03 torch on 
the path of truth, love and joy.

245
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:58,549
00:37:46:18 00:37:51:16 May God bless you.

246
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:10,200
00:38:04:03 00:38:06:27 Today first we'll
have a short puja of

247
00:31:10,200 --> 00:32:01,809
00:38:07:10 00:38:08:22 Shri Ganesh
00:38:09:09 00:38:11:04 and then of 

248
00:32:01,809 --> 00:33:44,519
Shiva
00:38:10:17 00:38:12:19 And lastly of 

249
00:33:44,519 --> 00:34:41,770
the Goddess.
00:38:12:29 00:38:15:23 We 

250
00:34:41,770 --> 00:37:47,540
have little bit changed the sequence.
