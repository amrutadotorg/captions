00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.929
...Such a pleasure
to come back to you all.

00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:07.390
I was looking forward to it.

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:12.463
I received all your letters
and greeting and all that you told.

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:23.927
It was so loving and so encouraging

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:29.890
to know about your progress here

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:36.916
and when I was really working
very, very, very, very hard,

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:41.398
I used to think of you

00:00:43.086 --> 00:00:44.343
and I would

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.617
put this idea into my mind

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.726
that a day will come

00:00:50.927 --> 00:00:54.966
when the prophecy
of William Blake must come true.

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:02.976
I went to Australia

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:09.731
and I was amazed
the way miracles took place

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.843
in that country.

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:20.489
It is said that in the Puranas

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.236
there was a saint called Thrissanku,

00:01:24.737 --> 00:01:27.537
who committed some mistake,
little mistake

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.299
and he was sent

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:33.825
as the Southern Cross
hanging in the air

00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.002
and was told that you must
create your own heaven.

00:01:37.203 --> 00:01:41.619
And really Australia is heaven,
no doubt, but itís Mooladhara.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.180
It is Mooladhara.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:47.354
The people are

00:01:51.982 --> 00:01:57.684
of course getting all the ideas,
over read, as we are here.

00:01:58.422 --> 00:02:02.710
We have accepted all these also
wrong ideas quite a lot.

00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.093
But somehow I feel it still
in the heart of heart,

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:10.666
they feel that this may not be
correct way of life

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:15.132
and they still feel that
some off the things we do is not

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.895
absolutely perfect

00:02:19.314 --> 00:02:22.541
or is not the thing
that we really [unclear].

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.528
There are all sorts of
gurus in Australia,

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.838
all sorts of people
who are there.

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:33.572
But basically

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.403
they do not accept now people

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:41.945
who

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.924
who come there
and preach absurd things

00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:51.106
without any [unclear] to the ancient
scriptures and things.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.466
So they are
traditional people in a way,

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.393
as far as their religious ideas
are concerned.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.486
But they are

00:03:01.893 --> 00:03:03.830
very, very open-minded,

00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:07.455
for example,
the first miracle that took place

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:12.601
was that there was a lady
who was an actress,

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.013
who was very sick.

00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:19.182
She got her paralysis attack
or some sort of thing like that

00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:22.255
and the doctor said
that she will not be cured.

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:24.658
She will die maybe next day

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.596
and there is no possibility
of her getting cured.

00:03:29.797 --> 00:03:33.786
So the friend of hers,
who is a very big journalist,

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:38.686
he came to a homeopath who is

00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:43.132
a Sahaj yogi,

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:46.570
and asked if she could help
with homeopathy.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.773
So she said I canít help you
with homeopathy,

00:03:49.974 --> 00:03:52.635
only thing I have got is -
ëphotographí, which you can take it

00:03:52.836 --> 00:03:56.083
and put it under her pillow
and maybe this might work.

00:03:56.697 --> 00:03:59.130
So he took the photograph
because she was a [unclear],

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.031
there was nothing to be questioned,

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:05.910
and put it under her pillow and
next day she opened her eyes.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.325
And they couldnít believe it.

00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:11.330
And as usual doctors said, "oh must
be this - must be that, you see,

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:15.424
sure she should not,
she should not in any case survive,

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.625
because in any case her brain
is damaged, no doubt,

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:21.919
we have seen it
that her brain is damaged."

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:24.476
But next day she started talking.

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:26.257
They couldnít believe it

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:29.151
that she is talking,
that means that her brain alright.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:31.205
She improved gradually.

00:04:31.406 --> 00:04:32.901
But all this click

00:04:33.297 --> 00:04:35.375
a different atmosphere,

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.226
a very different atmosphere
for Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:42.369
because the one,
the friend who was her friend,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.104
the one who was
very much interested in her heal,

00:04:48.604 --> 00:04:53.018
was a man who is
very highly placed in journalism,

00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:56.538
though he is not a Sahaja Yogi
or anything but he sent

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:59.591
a journalist to me,

00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:03.195
to our program,
he and his wife,

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:07.223
who is the president of
journalist association in Australia,

00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:08.704
got realisation.

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:13.697
And that really clicked
the whole thing.

00:05:14.435 --> 00:05:17.231
So these medias
can be also used

00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:20.947
and ones they are used
you can do a lot of things.

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:24.526
But at the helm of affairs
we should have people

00:05:25.078 --> 00:05:26.242
who are

00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:31.825
not arrogant,
are mild.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.002
You can say all people

00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:37.953
who are humble,

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:42.632
humble enough
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.843
Of cause as usual
there were some encounters.

00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:50.394
One of them was ëtwice borní
had come.

00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:53.376
So they came to
fight with me, twice born.

00:05:54.097 --> 00:05:55.627
And this is actually...

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:58.708
Twice born,
this has come from America.

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.606
When I went to America last time,

00:06:00.807 --> 00:06:04.632
they had told me that I must get
all my lectures registered

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:07.533
and all that kind of
a copyright I must keep.

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.419
I said to her,
ëwhy should I keep it like that?í

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.960
They said, ëno, no, no,
then they will use your lecturesí.

00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.617
I said, ëlet them use it, after all, realisation I have to give in any case.

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:17.393
They canít give realisation.

00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:19.695
So when I said there that
ëyou have to be born again,

00:06:19.896 --> 00:06:24.132
you are to be twice born, they started an organisation called ëtwice borní.

00:06:26.388 --> 00:06:28.460
There are so many,
like ëtrue vibrationsí

00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:32.843
all sorts of organisations have
started, in America on those lines.

00:06:33.232 --> 00:06:35.559
So this twice born
came to fight with me,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.864
saying that, what is your authority?
I said, ëwhat is your authority?í

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.745
They: ëMy authority is bibleí.

00:06:40.946 --> 00:06:43.846
I said, ëalright,
what is authority of bible?

00:06:44.078 --> 00:06:47.976
They: authority of bible is Christ.
I said, ëChrist never wrote bibleí.

00:06:48.732 --> 00:06:51.273
He never wrote it,
He had nothing to do with bible.

00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:52.914
He never wrote it.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.804
So they never knew
how to answer me...

00:07:03.536 --> 00:07:05.264
They said, ëstill you must have
an authority.

00:07:05.465 --> 00:07:09.169
I have, I will prove my authority.
First of all you tell me,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.713
your authority
to ask these questions.

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:14.394
They carried bible in their hand,
you know...

00:07:14.595 --> 00:07:16.931
He said here is written
- I am the Alpha and omega.

00:07:17.132 --> 00:07:20.276
I said, He is,
but who is goint to accept it.

00:07:20.586 --> 00:07:23.604
You believe in Christianity, alright,
because you were born in it.

00:07:23.805 --> 00:07:25.890
If you were born a Hindu,
you would have been Hindu,

00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:29.995
because you are a type who
would belong to something somehow.

00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:34.756
I can prove it, that He was
the omega and He was the alpha.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.810
Then they started

00:07:41.236 --> 00:07:44.489
attacking this that,
somehow everybody

00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:48.234
threw them out and it was over.

00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:55.213
It was very interesting because
so many people got realisation

00:07:57.086 --> 00:08:01.104
and they came to programs
that we had, so called seminars.

00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:03.632
In the open we arranged seminars,

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.481
because we had no place to go to
with 500 - 600 people.

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:11.596
So, there is one gentleman
who has a big house,

00:08:11.797 --> 00:08:14.937
which has got a big compound.
So we invited them, all of them there

00:08:15.138 --> 00:08:19.265
because [unclear]. And the whole
[unclear] was there. It was like a

00:08:21.594 --> 00:08:25.205
sermon on the mount, sort of thing.
So many of them sitting there

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:27.979
and having their food
and they talking and all that.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.309
So many people getting cured,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.906
it was really remarkable the way
these people took such interest

00:08:35.646 --> 00:08:39.578
and came all the way and from the
first time they had their realisation

00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:43.317
and every day they came
for about seven days,

00:08:43.518 --> 00:08:48.343
every day, every evening they all
came from all over the place.

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:51.994
We had people from
Tasmania who came down

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.078
and we had people from Melbourne,

00:08:55.385 --> 00:08:58.726
from New Zealand, from all over,
we got people there.

00:08:58.927 --> 00:09:03.054
They came and stayed in the ashram. Ashram itself is another beautiful place.

00:09:03.404 --> 00:09:07.302
Thereís a miraculous story, they say
that, one day Meera rang me up

00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:10.674
to say that, they have already sold their house, weíve got no place to go to

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:13.028
and we canít find a place to live in,

00:09:13.229 --> 00:09:15.216
because they were expecting
some place to come through

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:17.460
but there is no place available.

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.562
I said alright now donít worry
tomorrow you will get the place.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.492
And she couldnít believe it,
how can that be.

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:28.002
And they had told about
two hundred agents,

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:30.207
who said that,
there is no such place available

00:09:30.408 --> 00:09:32.408
and we just canít get you a place.

00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:35.067
And

00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:42.057
when he, Terence,
her husband had gone out

00:09:42.924 --> 00:09:47.109
and he was looking out for things and
he came back home very tired

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.781
so Meera said that, ìMother has told
that tomorrow you going to get it.

00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:52.500
He said, ëtomorrow?

00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:54.057
Can it be possible?í

00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:57.223
Said now there was
a telephone call in the evening

00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:59.817
from somewhere
and she gave him number.

00:10:00.146 --> 00:10:03.651
So he rang up in the morning
to ask that number, what was it?

00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:05.351
It was from and agent.

00:10:05.552 --> 00:10:07.757
They said, we have found
a place for you.

00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.468
If you want you can
occupy it right now.

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:13.875
So the next day
they moved into the house.

00:10:14.076 --> 00:10:15.516
Actually they did.

00:10:15.732 --> 00:10:18.328
And it is a beautiful place
with fourteen bedrooms

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:22.002
and a huge big hall.
Itís a beautiful place.

00:10:22.474 --> 00:10:24.207
So thatís how they got it.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.778
So many things work out this way.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.682
And they said that not only
that we have got the blessing

00:10:36.172 --> 00:10:38.986
but so many miraculous
material things are happening

00:10:39.187 --> 00:10:41.007
that we are really surprised.

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:45.630
But Iíve already told you that it is
written that, ëYoga Kshema Vahamyaí

00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:50.484
- first you must get your yoga and
that kshema will come afterwards.

00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:52.614
The wellbeing comes afterwards.

00:10:53.646 --> 00:10:55.646
Of course in the discussion

00:10:56.685 --> 00:10:59.427
it turned out
to be

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:03.812
something much more revealing

00:11:04.719 --> 00:11:06.906
when I was talking to people.

00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:11.541
So many things which
I have not told you people

00:11:11.742 --> 00:11:14.843
or Indians so far,
I told them about Christ.

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.161
I hope you have
received their tapes.

00:11:18.856 --> 00:11:20.645
Not yet, they are sending.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.510
Have you heard them?

00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:24.909
What is [unclear] saying?

00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:30.515
I think you are going into
thoughtless awareness isnít it.

00:11:30.716 --> 00:11:33.161
There is nothing
they distributed to you.

00:11:34.312 --> 00:11:37.177
The thing I told them
about Christ was this

00:11:38.392 --> 00:11:40.015
that everybody did

00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:49.364
something great for our awareness,

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.991
like Moses, who brought in
the idea of dharma.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:55.395
He gave us the idea of balance

00:11:55.825 --> 00:11:58.700
and we had Ebrahem
and all these people.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:02.900
But Christ did
the greatest thing in a way,

00:12:03.346 --> 00:12:08.906
because he came in at a point,
which is the Agnya chakra

00:12:09.398 --> 00:12:12.288
where ego and superego
cross each other.

00:12:15.744 --> 00:12:20.275
And, what he did, that all these
karma theories that was there, so far

00:12:20.476 --> 00:12:25.376
that you had to suffer your karmas,
he came to counter act it, by saying

00:12:25.577 --> 00:12:30.906
that, ëHe died for our sinsí.

00:12:32.594 --> 00:12:35.554
Means He can suck our karmas.

00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:40.864
So this theory of karma is over now
because Christ is born.

00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:45.286
If Christ could be awakened
in your agnya chakra

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.262
then all your karmas,
past karmas,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.486
all your sins,
will be sucked by this awakening.

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:58.906
But Christians, those who went
to India, were stupid people.

00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:04.067
They wanted to extend
their empire there,

00:13:04.323 --> 00:13:06.544
on their own, not of Christ.

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:10.494
So they never communicate; I donít
know if they even saw what it meant

00:13:10.695 --> 00:13:15.698
- ëdying for our sinsí what it had
relation with karma theory.

00:13:16.354 --> 00:13:19.426
So when they went to India,

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:23.406
they put Christ in such a funny way,

00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:27.515
that Indians would not accept,
would not accept Him.

00:13:28.164 --> 00:13:32.031
And because of that,
the integration of Christís life,

00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:35.145
with Indian philosophy
could not take place.

00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:38.908
On the contrary, they repelled,
completely repelled Him.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.080
And they could not understand Bible.
They would not see it.

00:13:44.796 --> 00:13:48.198
Thatís how Christ who came
on this earth,

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:52.614
for such a great purpose
was to suck our karmas,

00:13:53.239 --> 00:13:55.512
was completely lost to them.

00:13:55.713 --> 00:13:58.919
And still so many gurus are talking
about our karma theory

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.390
and making full advantage of it.

00:14:01.648 --> 00:14:04.122
They are not aware that
Christ came for this thing.

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:08.247
He has already done it for us.
Once your agnya

00:14:08.794 --> 00:14:12.827
is established and you get
your Christ awakened within you,

00:14:13.028 --> 00:14:16.460
all your previous sins
are sucked in.

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:22.546
But the most
unfortunate thing is that

00:14:22.747 --> 00:14:25.932
those who are supposed to be
Christian nations

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.239
have the worst agnyaís.

00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:35.937
This is the biggest tragedy is

00:14:37.177 --> 00:14:42.656
that they have forgotten
the ëLordís Prayerí,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.958
which is the mantra for our agnya.

00:14:50.638 --> 00:14:55.698
I think forgiving others
is a very important thing.

00:14:56.989 --> 00:14:59.864
We must learn to forgive.

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:04.713
All the time
we must learn to forgive.

00:15:07.562 --> 00:15:11.538
That is the best way we can keep
our agnya in control

00:15:11.739 --> 00:15:14.150
and our ego at its proper level.

00:15:16.143 --> 00:15:19.989
What right have you got to be
not forgiving,

00:15:20.997 --> 00:15:24.823
because by not forgiving
you are harming yourself.

00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:34.448
Thatís why forgiving others
is the only way we can really

00:15:36.237 --> 00:15:39.822
control our agnya.
Even forgiving ourselves,

00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:43.573
we have to forgive ourselves
and we have to forgive others.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.794
Today is a day, when I should be
talking about Sahasrara.

00:15:50.396 --> 00:15:53.314
Because tomorrow
is the day of Sahasrara

00:15:55.627 --> 00:16:01.872
and that is the greatest blessing
of Sahaja Yoga after Christís advent.

00:16:03.974 --> 00:16:07.364
Even if He had sucked your sins,

00:16:10.013 --> 00:16:13.281
you are to be given realisation.

00:16:16.672 --> 00:16:18.497
Without realisation

00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:22.445
it has no meaning

00:16:24.913 --> 00:16:27.590
and so this Sahaja Yoga

00:16:28.168 --> 00:16:30.094
which is todays ëMahaYogaí

00:16:30.703 --> 00:16:35.520
came into being because you all
have to be realised.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:42.046
You have to know yourself.

00:16:42.633 --> 00:16:45.320
The Self that is the Spirit,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.288
that is the only way
we can know God.

00:16:49.489 --> 00:16:51.351
There is no other way

00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:53.900
that we can know God.

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:59.281
We have to be our Spirit.

00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:04.890
The second thing that we

00:17:05.211 --> 00:17:09.179
in all the Christian nations
have done is to forget our Spirit.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.958
It is a double catch. If the ego
develops, it covers your heart.

00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:18.512
You can even become emotionless.

00:17:20.536 --> 00:17:22.997
When it covers your heart,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.432
then your heart
becomes like a stone

00:17:26.854 --> 00:17:29.489
and the Spirit does not shine.

00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:34.067
All the time what you have to say,

00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:36.801
that "Iím the Spirit!"

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.921
All the realised souls
have to say: ìIím the Spirit.

00:17:44.122 --> 00:17:46.736
Iím not this body,
not this mind,

00:17:46.937 --> 00:17:52.083
nor this superego, none of these
ëuphadisí as the call them,

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.073
but Iím the Spirit,
the pure Spirit I am.î

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.744
If you could recognise that part
in you, that you are the Spirit,

00:18:07.945 --> 00:18:10.866
your realisation will be
fully established.

00:18:12.367 --> 00:18:16.065
As long as you are identified
with other things,

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:24.031
this cannot be established.

00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:30.254
So first and foremost thing
you have to recognise

00:18:30.455 --> 00:18:32.353
that you are the Spirit.

00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:36.448
You are not the thoughts
which are overcrowding you.

00:18:39.929 --> 00:18:41.140
You are not

00:18:42.695 --> 00:18:45.195
the fears with which you suffer,

00:18:45.396 --> 00:18:48.502
you are not the ambitions
with which you run,

00:18:48.703 --> 00:18:51.051
but you are that pure Spirit,

00:18:52.638 --> 00:18:56.135
which never changes,
which is eternal,

00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.335
which is blissful,

00:19:00.804 --> 00:19:02.749
which is Sat-Chit-Anand.

00:19:05.825 --> 00:19:10.976
We all Sahaja Yogis have to know,
that we are the Spirit.

00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:18.656
This is the mantra that one
has to recite for heart catch.

00:19:20.765 --> 00:19:22.843
If your heart is not clean,

00:19:25.734 --> 00:19:28.015
you can never get realisation.

00:19:30.073 --> 00:19:32.952
Anybody who comes with funny ideas
about Me you have seen,

00:19:33.153 --> 00:19:35.046
he never gets realisation.

00:19:37.297 --> 00:19:39.491
You have to have clean heart.

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:45.567
You have to cleanse your heart,
thatís why I sometimes say

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:51.239
that you have to put your guru into your heart, who will clean your heart.

00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:55.031
Just to clean your heart,

00:19:55.437 --> 00:19:58.166
as you employ
a maid in the house,

00:19:58.367 --> 00:20:02.757
to clean your heart you can employ
your mother for that purpose.

00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:07.195
Cleansing is my job,
morning till evening Iím cleansing.

00:20:07.437 --> 00:20:09.361
Thatís my name means also.

00:20:10.534 --> 00:20:14.215
But cleansing is such a big thing,
such a big thing

00:20:14.622 --> 00:20:18.682
that, that brings forth
everything else with it.

00:20:20.036 --> 00:20:24.012
If there is
dust on the diamond,

00:20:24.427 --> 00:20:29.390
on any diamond which will be
very expensive, you cannot see it!

00:20:32.976 --> 00:20:36.124
In the same way
if your Spirit is clouded

00:20:36.469 --> 00:20:38.700
with doubts and fears,

00:20:41.161 --> 00:20:42.695
cunningness,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.098
then your Spirit cannot shine.

00:20:48.044 --> 00:20:50.486
Now, it is such a vicious circle

00:20:51.479 --> 00:20:54.198
that it is not easy to break.

00:20:55.591 --> 00:20:58.562
Even there
your mind can cheat you.

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:04.135
For Sahaja Yogi it is very easy,
is to sit before My photograph,

00:21:04.336 --> 00:21:07.731
put your left hand here and one on your heart and say: Iím the Spirit.

00:21:07.932 --> 00:21:09.656
Mother, Iím the Spirit.

00:21:10.203 --> 00:21:11.827
Can you try that now?

00:21:12.231 --> 00:21:15.187
Just put it and say it together.

00:21:39.557 --> 00:21:44.114
And a humbler way could be also:
ëMother, am I the Spirit?í

00:21:58.573 --> 00:21:59.573
See now...

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.327
Now, Sahasrara breaking took place

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:20.007
on the 5th of May 1970.

00:22:24.687 --> 00:22:26.892
I was just pushed into it.

00:22:28.518 --> 00:22:31.265
Then I said one has to now break it.

00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:40.973
And if you see
a very thin line of Kundalini

00:22:41.607 --> 00:22:45.109
really breaks the Sahasrara
through the heart chakra.

00:22:45.812 --> 00:22:47.484
Here is the heart chakra.

00:22:47.989 --> 00:22:52.531
Through the heart chakra point only it breaks. If your heart is not clean,

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.747
it will not break.

00:22:57.482 --> 00:22:59.997
So the first and the foremost thing

00:23:00.198 --> 00:23:02.840
is your Shiva Tattwa,
is your heart.

00:23:03.646 --> 00:23:07.200
Heart must be kept absolutely clean.

00:23:07.822 --> 00:23:09.965
There should be nothing,

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.580
that is doubting,

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.129
that is confused,

00:23:16.505 --> 00:23:17.968
that is angry,

00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:19.786
that is ambitious,

00:23:21.325 --> 00:23:22.978
that is afraid of;

00:23:23.221 --> 00:23:25.752
nothing of that kind
should be in the heart.

00:23:25.953 --> 00:23:29.281
Just be confident.

00:23:31.945 --> 00:23:34.700
Just leave it into the hands of God.

00:23:40.872 --> 00:23:44.448
Because that is the point
where the Kundalini breaks it

00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:47.215
and if that point is heavy,

00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:50.257
you can never break the Sahasrara.

00:23:51.648 --> 00:23:54.387
then it happens, itís such
a vicious circle again sets in,

00:23:54.588 --> 00:23:58.609
those people who have a bad heart,
they come to me

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.332
and they cannot get realisation.
So they have an additional chance

00:24:02.533 --> 00:24:05.031
to attack me by saying
 ëWe never got the realisation,

00:24:05.232 --> 00:24:08.520
we never felt the vibrations,
so how is it, that You are this?í

00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:10.626
Because already your heart is dirty,
you see.

00:24:10.827 --> 00:24:13.708
It starts there emitting manifesting
its spirit.

00:24:15.057 --> 00:24:16.903
And it goes and adding up
and adding up

00:24:17.104 --> 00:24:20.205
and then they can build up
a big story against me.

00:24:22.174 --> 00:24:25.921
But the main thing is you have come
to ask for something so great.

00:24:26.122 --> 00:24:29.197
You have to be,
have a heart which is humble,

00:24:30.729 --> 00:24:31.963
steadfast

00:24:33.448 --> 00:24:35.848
and also proud of it self.

00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:42.366
Because in this heart is the Spirit
which is going to be enshrined.

00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:48.629
Now what do I do
about your realisation.

00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:51.948
My heart is very pure,

00:24:52.393 --> 00:24:53.822
absolute purity.

00:24:54.823 --> 00:24:58.033
There is not even
the slightest ripple

00:24:59.627 --> 00:25:01.885
of anything else but love for you.

00:25:02.086 --> 00:25:04.520
Even if I get angry
it is out of love.

00:25:04.721 --> 00:25:09.830
Even if I say something sometimes
harshly, it is out of love,

00:25:10.031 --> 00:25:12.296
to keep you out of troubles.

00:25:15.937 --> 00:25:19.823
But, in my heart there is nothing
but pure love, pure love.

00:25:21.682 --> 00:25:25.814
And this pure love is the pure Vidya,
is the pure knowledge.

00:25:26.182 --> 00:25:28.447
Is the pure knowledge,
is pure Vidya.

00:25:28.648 --> 00:25:31.718
The complete technique of purity
it knows.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.468
How does the water purify you?

00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:38.489
Do you know the technique
what the water does to you?

00:25:39.364 --> 00:25:43.096
The complete technique
of purity resides

00:25:44.862 --> 00:25:46.031
in the heart

00:25:48.687 --> 00:25:52.156
and how do I give you realisation

00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:54.150
is to put you in my heart.

00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:56.163
Bathe you there nicely.

00:25:56.604 --> 00:25:58.392
Have you seen crocodiles?

00:26:04.299 --> 00:26:07.596
Crocodiles have;
are very ferocious;

00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:13.551
but when they hatch their eggs, they take all little, little crocodiles

00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:15.307
in their big mouth,
you see,

00:26:15.508 --> 00:26:19.653
and you should see the eyes
of the crocodile, as is full of love

00:26:19.854 --> 00:26:21.038
and all such...

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.570
as the children hatch.

00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:29.270
And the crocodile then put
the mouth inside the water

00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:31.864
and cleanses them like this.

00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:38.028
First thing I do
is to give you birth in my heart

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:41.583
and then cleanse you there
in my heart,

00:26:44.315 --> 00:26:47.132
and then take you

00:26:48.383 --> 00:26:52.114
through my Sahasrara.
I give you your second birth.

00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:58.536
Many people ask, that ëwhat happens
to our karma and this?í

00:26:58.737 --> 00:27:00.600
I say:
"I cleanse it!"

00:27:04.885 --> 00:27:06.881
It has to be cleansed.

00:27:07.937 --> 00:27:11.163
So many people have asked
one question so many times,

00:27:11.364 --> 00:27:15.187
that how is it that Kundalini is such
a difficult thing and how is it,

00:27:15.388 --> 00:27:16.934
You can do so well?

00:27:17.518 --> 00:27:20.325
I say, there must be
something special about me.

00:27:20.526 --> 00:27:22.351
I need not tell them who I am.

00:27:22.552 --> 00:27:26.228
If I say Adi Shakti, they say some
sort of a (inaudible) woman,

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:29.374
see who is about to Adi Shakti
or else Shakti itself

00:27:29.575 --> 00:27:33.715
- power itself is horrifying and then
on top of that is ëAdi Shaktií.

00:27:33.997 --> 00:27:37.330
But this is the Adi Shakti of love

00:27:39.906 --> 00:27:42.546
which is beyond human conception.

00:27:44.694 --> 00:27:48.533
Only by its power you can
recognise it and understand it.

00:27:48.734 --> 00:27:50.611
How it cleanses you.

00:27:51.143 --> 00:27:55.533
Thatís how people get cured.
They donít know how they get cured.

00:27:55.768 --> 00:27:57.887
Just with a photograph
under your pillow.

00:27:58.088 --> 00:28:00.835
There is another actress in India
who is getting cured,

00:28:01.036 --> 00:28:03.531
a very famous actress,
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:03.828 --> 00:28:06.981
Just they canít understand
and they cannot explain.

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:09.924
But this is a pure knowledge
of cleansing

00:28:10.125 --> 00:28:13.554
which is built in that photograph,
built in!

00:28:14.953 --> 00:28:16.564
It knows vibrations.

00:28:17.737 --> 00:28:21.463
It knows everything. The whole
technique is built inside.

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:24.507
Once you have the vibrations,
you donít have to learn

00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:27.184
any technique,
it works out by itself.

00:28:31.434 --> 00:28:33.124
It is very subtle.

00:28:34.232 --> 00:28:36.497
It is complete Brahma Shakti.

00:28:37.505 --> 00:28:41.843
It is a very powerful, very
penetrating, very understanding;

00:28:42.445 --> 00:28:45.802
but it has all its knowledge
built in itself.

00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:52.557
Itís the Shuddha Vidya,
is the pure knowledge.

00:28:53.237 --> 00:28:56.215
When you say Nirmala Vidya
is also the same.

00:28:56.966 --> 00:28:58.624
It is immaculate.

00:29:00.594 --> 00:29:03.390
It cannot be compared
with anything else.

00:29:04.255 --> 00:29:07.015
The technique is so perfect,

00:29:07.966 --> 00:29:09.629
that it never fails.

00:29:12.448 --> 00:29:15.429
It knows all the permutations
and combinations.

00:29:15.872 --> 00:29:17.887
It knows how to work it out.

00:29:20.903 --> 00:29:23.895
One has to enter
into the kingdom of God

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:27.588
to see the working
of all these techniques.

00:29:27.916 --> 00:29:32.038
That is why it was necessary
to open the Sahasrara of people.

00:29:32.312 --> 00:29:36.616
Otherwise everything is
Greek and Latin for people

00:29:37.773 --> 00:29:40.666
who listen to all these
great prophets

00:29:41.151 --> 00:29:45.929
and to great Avataras; they thought
they were talking trough their hats.

00:29:46.797 --> 00:29:50.726
I mean that nowadays
we talk through our hats only.

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:53.445
Because Sahasrara is there

00:29:53.804 --> 00:29:57.411
and through Sahasrara
we hear and we talk.

00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:04.635
To break the Sahasrara
was very important.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:10.525
Of course you were also ready
to receive it.

00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:16.171
The time had come.
Mutual understanding was there

00:30:16.372 --> 00:30:17.895
and it worked out.

00:30:19.302 --> 00:30:23.314
Itís a tremendous thing
that has happened.

00:30:25.096 --> 00:30:27.265
It should work out in England.

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.781
I should be here on this day

00:30:29.982 --> 00:30:33.566
because as I have told you before,
England is the heart,

00:30:35.406 --> 00:30:37.086
heart of the Universe.

00:30:37.703 --> 00:30:40.744
So we should see whatís wrong
with us. Very important

00:30:40.945 --> 00:30:43.427
for us to see as English people,

00:30:43.628 --> 00:30:47.380
living in England, whatís wrong
with us, with our heart,

00:30:49.534 --> 00:30:54.291
because we are responsible
for this great happening,

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.708
because only through heart...

00:30:58.073 --> 00:31:01.617
[Tape one ends here.
Second tape follow]

00:31:04.324 --> 00:31:08.237
...as political structure
and as an individual.

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.886
Because if the English

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.279
could clear the atmosphere
of England,

00:31:23.655 --> 00:31:31.178
it would be very easy to click
the Sahaja Yoga throughout the world

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.615
and that is why the responsibility
of English is much more.

00:31:41.152 --> 00:31:43.073
One good thing has started

00:31:43.488 --> 00:31:46.047
after my visit to Australia;

00:31:47.194 --> 00:31:49.680
people have started
donating land to us.

00:31:50.157 --> 00:31:53.784
Now we have got a plot of land
in [unsure], Bombay,

00:31:54.147 --> 00:31:56.490
very near there about,

00:31:57.842 --> 00:31:58.849
I think,

00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:02.115
about fifty miles away
from Bombay.

00:32:02.889 --> 00:32:05.896
Weíve got another plot of land
of seven acres

00:32:06.097 --> 00:32:07.995
which was donated to us.

00:32:10.918 --> 00:32:15.146
There is also possibility of us getting a bigger land of twenty five acres,

00:32:15.347 --> 00:32:18.907
which some of you have seen,
along the River Neda.

00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:22.391
And also there is a possibility

00:32:23.931 --> 00:32:27.579
of getting another nice land
of seven acres in Pune.

00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:31.529
In Delhi they have offered us
a very, very beautiful land

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:36.120
along a lake and a beautiful
surroundings of a forest,

00:32:36.933 --> 00:32:39.277
very much near the river Yamuna.

00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:43.409
So now, my visit to Australia
has materialised

00:32:44.441 --> 00:32:48.417
but my stay in England

00:32:48.751 --> 00:32:51.759
must materialise other thing
is the cleansing.

00:32:52.535 --> 00:32:55.964
First of all let us all start
from our individual,

00:32:56.183 --> 00:32:57.810
our individual hearts

00:32:58.092 --> 00:33:00.068
and then try to expand it.

00:33:00.813 --> 00:33:03.282
Every time, what I find is this

00:33:03.805 --> 00:33:07.818
that whatever you are supposed
to do, you do just the opposite.

00:33:09.657 --> 00:33:11.875
Like ëliverí,

00:33:13.139 --> 00:33:15.826
as I said is Europe

00:33:16.965 --> 00:33:19.537
and liver drinks the most of it.

00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:24.454
They produced the best wines;

00:33:25.121 --> 00:33:27.349
theyíre experts in the wines.

00:33:27.592 --> 00:33:31.396
The liver, liver produces the wines.
You see this is the best part.

00:33:32.581 --> 00:33:33.959
If you imagine,

00:33:34.566 --> 00:33:38.073
if you imagine distillery
in your liver, what will happen.

00:33:38.449 --> 00:33:41.284
So the liver has become
the distillery.

00:33:44.306 --> 00:33:45.894
This is very surprising.

00:33:46.095 --> 00:33:50.547
Now, this is the heart
- heart has to be large-harted,

00:33:50.883 --> 00:33:52.675
one has to be large-hearted.

00:33:52.876 --> 00:33:55.415
So you have become
small-hearted.

00:33:58.543 --> 00:34:01.698
A man with a heart
is very courageous,

00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:05.290
very bold,
very heard-bolding.

00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:09.514
Here we have lots of fears,

00:34:10.178 --> 00:34:13.037
problems
and poets like Lord Byron.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:25.787
Our idea of universality
is so limited

00:34:26.803 --> 00:34:32.334
that we think we live somewhere away
from the rest of the world

00:34:32.764 --> 00:34:36.646
and we are just here and we should
not be touched by anybody else.

00:34:36.847 --> 00:34:40.342
This is our heart, with the heart
has to circulate all over the world

00:34:40.543 --> 00:34:42.977
and gather all the filth of the world
and cleansed it.

00:34:43.178 --> 00:34:47.060
You have gathered the filth,
alright, but cleansing part...

00:34:49.267 --> 00:34:52.326
Circulation they have done alright.
They have been up to China,

00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:53.977
they have been up to every place.

00:34:54.178 --> 00:34:56.844
I mean every, every nook and corner
they have reached you see,

00:34:57.045 --> 00:34:58.611
with their little heart.

00:34:58.812 --> 00:35:01.701
But when they have gathered all that
with them, they donít know

00:35:01.902 --> 00:35:03.342
how to cleanse it.

00:35:04.126 --> 00:35:05.961
That they better do it,

00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:08.389
this is their job.

00:35:09.793 --> 00:35:13.779
So this test you should put to
all your problems here

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.831
and youíll be amazed that
the heart needs cleansing,

00:35:18.668 --> 00:35:20.495
enlargement of the heart,

00:35:20.777 --> 00:35:22.490
greatness of the heart,

00:35:22.691 --> 00:35:24.529
the health of the heart

00:35:24.827 --> 00:35:31.334
and the all-compassing
forgiveness of the heart.

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:39.287
And ego is the worst enemy of heart,

00:35:39.522 --> 00:35:43.829
is the worst enemy. If anything gives
you heart attack - it is your ego.

00:35:46.241 --> 00:35:49.412
And you have egos
of various types.

00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:53.234
All kinds of egos can be found here.

00:35:55.555 --> 00:36:00.219
All kinds you see as you can find
all kinds of wines in (inaudible).

00:36:05.633 --> 00:36:08.403
So we have to also know
what kind of food

00:36:08.604 --> 00:36:12.320
we require for this heart
to be kept cleansed.

00:36:15.414 --> 00:36:20.418
First of all
we must develop a heart

00:36:21.981 --> 00:36:25.267
which has sweet feelings for others,

00:36:29.544 --> 00:36:32.106
understanding for others,

00:36:38.677 --> 00:36:40.741
generosity for others.

00:36:41.023 --> 00:36:44.090
It is not reading the novel
that you get there,

00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:46.271
but

00:36:47.499 --> 00:36:51.359
an understanding of a heart
that loves,

00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:53.520
that cares for you.

00:36:53.721 --> 00:36:56.260
It may quarrel with someone,

00:36:57.111 --> 00:36:59.603
may be jealous of someone,
maybe that,

00:36:59.804 --> 00:37:02.144
but should love
from the heart.

00:37:04.101 --> 00:37:08.114
You can never see that person
being harmed by any chance.

00:37:10.286 --> 00:37:11.286
All

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.708
the wealth of the world,
all the ego of the world

00:37:15.935 --> 00:37:19.468
you will deny
to give your love.

00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:24.168
The love giving capacity

00:37:24.854 --> 00:37:26.588
has to be increased

00:37:26.893 --> 00:37:34.343
and nourished by things that
talk about generosity [unclear].

00:37:35.351 --> 00:37:38.291
Like save the power business
is useless.

00:37:39.846 --> 00:37:42.596
Save the heart you should start now.

00:37:43.557 --> 00:37:45.796
You have to save the heart

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.452
because it is you the English who are
going to save the heart

00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:52.215
of the universe.

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:56.825
So the Sahaja Yogis have to have
very large heartedness.

00:38:00.666 --> 00:38:02.320
Very clean heart.

00:38:02.961 --> 00:38:05.452
There should be no cunningness.

00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:08.027
No cunningness in the heart.

00:38:08.321 --> 00:38:11.764
While you know English have been
the most cunning race

00:38:12.662 --> 00:38:14.748
all over the world.
People know about. Oh!

00:38:14.949 --> 00:38:17.430
If there is an Englishmen - had it!

00:38:18.884 --> 00:38:22.954
Only somebody
who can beat English is Indian.

00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:29.167
They know how to out beat you.
There is a big competition.

00:38:29.368 --> 00:38:31.474
I donít know which one wins.

00:38:32.704 --> 00:38:36.178
But if it comes to Indians,
they can out beat it.

00:38:36.379 --> 00:38:39.592
Now the latest is the guru system.

00:38:41.454 --> 00:38:43.297
From here the English went

00:38:43.498 --> 00:38:47.563
and all the Western people went to
raid all the developing countries.

00:38:47.999 --> 00:38:51.586
So the greatest of greatest,
our India, has

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.839
created such cunning people,
absolutely cunningness,

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.592
that they be fooled you
very nicely.

00:39:01.303 --> 00:39:04.016
All the English went nicely be-fooled

00:39:04.954 --> 00:39:06.634
and all the Americans

00:39:07.435 --> 00:39:11.114
and all the Australians.
All of them put together

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.909
could not find a few cunning people
from India.

00:39:16.178 --> 00:39:20.287
So I should say for the time being
they have an upper hand.

00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:22.001
Maybe

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:26.641
the English today
with their clean heart

00:39:27.022 --> 00:39:29.162
develops such a sharp,

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.261
such a sharp edge
to their intelligence

00:39:33.988 --> 00:39:36.964
that they can expose
all these people

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.045
and cleanse

00:39:41.714 --> 00:39:44.435
the minds of the people
who have been fogged

00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:47.303
by the mesmerism
of this cunning people.

00:39:51.459 --> 00:39:53.185
So one has to realise

00:39:53.545 --> 00:39:56.099
that every action has a reaction,

00:39:56.433 --> 00:39:59.081
but the reaction comes the way

00:39:59.675 --> 00:40:01.331
the reactor is.

00:40:01.746 --> 00:40:04.886
Like the Indians
are cunning but sly.

00:40:07.504 --> 00:40:10.352
English are cunning
but intelligent.

00:40:10.553 --> 00:40:13.021
So they do it
in such an intelligent way you see,

00:40:13.222 --> 00:40:16.584
theyíll cut your throat and not even
a single drop of blood will fall out.

00:40:16.785 --> 00:40:20.800
They know all the laws and regulations, how to cut the throat of a person.

00:40:22.048 --> 00:40:25.555
But the Indians, they will not
even cut your throat

00:40:26.287 --> 00:40:28.185
and you will become mad.

00:40:31.191 --> 00:40:35.813
Just they know how to do it,
they are even more dangerous

00:40:36.142 --> 00:40:37.451
and subtler.

00:40:38.131 --> 00:40:42.342
I mean, I donít know, they might have
got first initiations from English

00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:46.319
and now they are teaching
their gurus, like that I believe.

00:40:46.576 --> 00:40:49.995
The cunning they have learned,
there is no end to it.

00:40:52.462 --> 00:40:56.284
And for everything they have
an argument and a suggestion,

00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:58.698
whatever it is.

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:02.360
You will be happy to know
that one of them - Ravana

00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:04.842
has got a paralytic attack now

00:41:05.149 --> 00:41:07.329
and he has got a broken neck

00:41:07.694 --> 00:41:10.211
and he is lying
in a hospital secretly.

00:41:10.412 --> 00:41:13.418
So thatís one thing
has already been done.

00:41:22.384 --> 00:41:25.948
Now, today is a day
of very great celebration,

00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:28.519
very great celebration,

00:41:28.837 --> 00:41:32.712
because it celebrates
the rebirth of the universe.

00:41:34.243 --> 00:41:39.483
It is nice to celebrate
the great advent of great people

00:41:39.684 --> 00:41:41.790
and their birth dates
and all that.

00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:43.860
Like we celebrate Christmas,

00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:46.938
we celebrate the birth date
of Nanaka and all these people

00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:48.581
- is great, no doubt.

00:41:49.816 --> 00:41:52.147
But this is the greatest when

00:41:52.655 --> 00:41:55.475
every human being
needs to be reborn,

00:41:57.538 --> 00:41:59.128
such a great thing.

00:42:01.098 --> 00:42:03.863
It is a very great day
and an event,

00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:09.282
when all the humans being were
promised to get their realisation.

00:42:13.204 --> 00:42:17.321
Without that you would
never have known the Spirit.

00:42:17.697 --> 00:42:20.787
You would never have known
God Almighty.

00:42:21.288 --> 00:42:23.990
You would never have known the love

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:27.282
that is permeating all of you.

00:42:27.483 --> 00:42:31.206
We would never have felt
that love, that power

00:42:31.629 --> 00:42:34.272
that controls the whole universe.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.839
You would have been blind
and blind and blind.

00:42:38.262 --> 00:42:41.467
So this is one of the greatest days

00:42:42.155 --> 00:42:45.305
that we have to celebrate
with great joy and happiness

00:42:45.506 --> 00:42:49.079
because it celebrates
the emancipation,

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.985
the evolution and the rebirth
of the humanity.

00:42:54.783 --> 00:42:59.712
Because the Advents
and all these great

00:43:01.228 --> 00:43:04.259
Incarnations
do not need any rebirth.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:08.134
They are permanently just the same,
they are permanently chiefs.

00:43:08.335 --> 00:43:11.131
Thereís no change in Them, nothing.

00:43:12.311 --> 00:43:15.227
So what is there to celebrate
their birthday, I donít understand,

00:43:15.428 --> 00:43:18.055
every year they are just the same,
their age is just the same,

00:43:18.256 --> 00:43:22.138
they remain the same.
What is a birthday, they never grow,

00:43:22.339 --> 00:43:25.628
they never mature,
they over matured already.

00:43:26.184 --> 00:43:29.811
But it is a great thing
that you all should

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:38.136
jump into that great realm
of Divinity,

00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:42.516
that you should know about
the All-pervading power

00:43:42.772 --> 00:43:45.831
and that you should become aware

00:43:46.277 --> 00:43:49.108
of that flow
of the power through you.

00:43:51.275 --> 00:43:56.040
Without this everything is useless.

00:43:57.392 --> 00:43:59.605
Everything is darkness.

00:43:59.806 --> 00:44:02.774
Everything is confusion
and relative.

00:44:05.337 --> 00:44:08.287
So let us all really today celebrate

00:44:08.488 --> 00:44:11.618
for all other Sahaja Yogis
who have received realisation,

00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:13.324
all over the world.

00:44:13.598 --> 00:44:19.061
They are all putting
their attention to you

00:44:21.264 --> 00:44:22.493
and today

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.701
they are all doing
their pujas in their own places.

00:44:28.902 --> 00:44:30.759
We have to think of them,

00:44:31.087 --> 00:44:33.506
because all of you are one,

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:40.876
connected with each other in love
and in common bondage of your Mother.

00:44:41.899 --> 00:44:43.891
May God Bless you all!

00:44:53.563 --> 00:44:55.375
Can I have some water?

00:44:58.816 --> 00:45:01.823
As desired by you,
we already got a video.

00:45:02.285 --> 00:45:06.076
Video tape, did you get
the video tape, did you get it?

00:45:08.988 --> 00:45:13.212
From Hong Kong, imagine in Hong Kong
the Chinese are great people.

00:45:14.837 --> 00:45:16.821
Chinese are tremendous.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.667
I mean they have our traditions,

00:45:20.191 --> 00:45:21.631
Indian traditions.

00:45:21.998 --> 00:45:24.534
I mean they are very
traditional people.

00:45:25.614 --> 00:45:26.915
But they are

00:45:27.985 --> 00:45:30.626
westernised as far as
other things are concerned.

00:45:30.827 --> 00:45:34.347
I mean there is a big palace,
Chinese have a big palace

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:38.813
and they have not lost their
aesthetics as Indians have lost.

00:45:39.058 --> 00:45:41.420
You see, they have all your
labour class aesthetics.

00:45:41.621 --> 00:45:44.610
Indians have plastics and nylons,
you see,

00:45:45.024 --> 00:45:46.323
but not Chinese.

00:45:46.524 --> 00:45:49.214
Chinese have maintained
their aesthetics.

00:45:49.603 --> 00:45:50.963
I was surprised.

00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:01.935
Any questions?

00:46:14.863 --> 00:46:17.612
Bala, I am so sorry
for the whole thing.

00:46:19.432 --> 00:46:21.761
But we have done a good job,
I must say.

00:46:21.962 --> 00:46:23.642
We have done a good job.

00:46:24.461 --> 00:46:28.495
I tell you because we had
no communication with you here.

00:46:28.696 --> 00:46:31.146
Phillip did not know
any address, nothing.

00:46:31.347 --> 00:46:35.058
I did not know how to contact
those people in Ceylon

00:46:35.514 --> 00:46:37.995
and we had already
planned out to go to Hong Kong.

00:46:38.196 --> 00:46:41.209
All my plans as usual,
were all upside down.

00:46:43.313 --> 00:46:45.909
You know this,
it all works out this way.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.534
There was one lady
called [unsure].

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.995
She came from Hong Kong

00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:54.894
and she wanted me
to go to Hong Kong

00:46:55.232 --> 00:46:59.096
and just to give her lesson perhaps,
you see, it worked out that way.

00:46:59.566 --> 00:47:00.852
So what to do?

00:47:06.412 --> 00:47:08.774
They say there is no plane direct
from Hong Kong

00:47:08.975 --> 00:47:11.219
you have to come back
to Singapore,

00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:16.102
if you have to go to Australia.

00:47:17.824 --> 00:47:21.050
So this was a big problem.
We thought that better do Hong Kong

00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:23.937
and come back
and then to Australia.

00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:29.443
Modi was there
Rahulís wife was there,

00:47:29.644 --> 00:47:31.438
both of them went down.

00:47:38.548 --> 00:47:42.805
India has done one good thing,
we are getting donations of land.

00:47:44.198 --> 00:47:45.878
This is something great.

00:47:46.582 --> 00:47:50.294
If we have no place we can
at least pitch our tents there.

00:47:58.204 --> 00:47:59.977
What else...something?

00:48:04.616 --> 00:48:06.125
Yogi:  Can we do your Puja?

00:48:06.326 --> 00:48:07.511
Can we take your puja?

00:48:07.712 --> 00:48:09.389
Puja, now, alright,

00:48:10.303 --> 00:48:11.654
better have it.
