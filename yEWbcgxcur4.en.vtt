00:00.800 --> 00:17.990
I must have said lots of things about

00:13.970 --> 00:23.029
Christ before and how Jesus Christ is

00:17.990 --> 00:27.619
created to steal a [ __ ] that he is the

00:23.029 --> 00:31.849
incarnation of Shri Ganesha who was the

00:27.619 --> 00:35.750
son of the Adi Shakti to begin with but

00:31.849 --> 00:39.320
then he was given to stay detached and

00:35.750 --> 00:42.649
shri radha created as Mahalakshmi as

00:39.320 --> 00:48.140
mother Mary this great incarnation of

00:42.649 --> 00:50.239
Christ now for the Western mind it is

00:48.140 --> 00:52.730
impossible to understand how there can

00:50.239 --> 00:55.190
be a Immaculate Conception because they

00:52.730 --> 00:58.249
have no sense at all no sensitive attack

00:55.190 --> 01:01.909
at all to spiritual life we Indians can

00:58.249 --> 01:04.880
understand it it's very easy for Indians

01:01.909 --> 01:06.980
to understand because we had Shri

01:04.880 --> 01:09.200
Ganesha created that way we just believe

01:06.980 --> 01:11.180
it we don't doubt these things whatever

01:09.200 --> 01:14.000
he said about God is not to be doubted

01:11.180 --> 01:18.650
with this limited brain that's not done

01:14.000 --> 01:22.250
in India but in the West from the very

01:18.650 --> 01:24.770
birth of Christ they have had arguments

01:22.250 --> 01:30.350
arguments arguments arguments with this

01:24.770 --> 01:33.500
limited brain they had his purity his

01:30.350 --> 01:36.380
holiness his auspiciousness it's never

01:33.500 --> 01:39.770
understood in the West I think the first

01:36.380 --> 01:45.830
and foremost thing he has said that you

01:39.770 --> 01:49.550
must enter into the kingdom of God that

01:45.830 --> 01:51.410
you must be born again so it's all

01:49.550 --> 01:54.460
mental you are born again you have a

01:51.410 --> 02:00.110
certificate we are born again finished

01:54.460 --> 02:07.569
so this mental attitude of the West is

02:00.110 --> 02:08.960
responsible for killing the great

02:07.569 --> 02:12.910
incarnation of

02:08.960 --> 02:15.410
Christ I think is another crucifixion

02:12.910 --> 02:19.130
mentally you cannot understand

02:15.410 --> 02:25.130
spirituality so as it is there made a

02:19.130 --> 02:29.870
mess of all the great incarnations but

02:25.130 --> 02:34.880
worst is done to Christ and I feel what

02:29.870 --> 02:40.280
a waste it was so we must understand

02:34.880 --> 02:44.590
Christ in the right sense he is the

02:40.280 --> 02:48.860
eternal child he is the innocence itself

02:44.590 --> 02:51.440
he's the source of innocence and he is

02:48.860 --> 02:56.000
the Beast over of all blessings in all

02:51.440 --> 02:59.780
chakras now one has to understand that

02:56.000 --> 03:04.100
how Christ at his miraculous life has

02:59.780 --> 03:08.990
shown so many miracles first of all his

03:04.100 --> 03:13.130
birth was immaculate they are beyond

03:08.990 --> 03:15.230
since their special people they may come

03:13.130 --> 03:17.930
as human beings they may come as angels

03:15.230 --> 03:20.750
they may come as anything they are

03:17.930 --> 03:23.780
divine and we should understand that

03:20.750 --> 03:28.310
this little brain of ours cannot discuss

03:23.780 --> 03:31.390
about them and talk about them but is to

03:28.310 --> 03:35.690
just surrender and worship them

03:31.390 --> 03:38.090
they are much beyond us so for the

03:35.690 --> 03:41.780
Western mind it is important to

03:38.090 --> 03:44.720
understand that the life of Christ was

03:41.780 --> 03:47.630
such a blessing for them that they have

03:44.720 --> 03:49.430
lost it they have wasted it and they

03:47.630 --> 03:54.740
have never understood how to respect it

03:49.430 --> 03:58.480
I had told you long time back that how

03:54.740 --> 04:02.360
we can prove that Christ was Ganesha and

03:58.480 --> 04:05.840
he was the logos he was the what we call

04:02.360 --> 04:09.440
is the Brahma not the first sound

04:05.840 --> 04:14.000
by looking at your left side from the

04:09.440 --> 04:16.780
right side if you see the mooladhara you

04:14.000 --> 04:21.049
will see swastikas because it is made of

04:16.780 --> 04:25.040
carbonate if you see from left to the

04:21.049 --> 04:27.070
right you can see all Ghana and if you

04:25.040 --> 04:30.830
see from down upward

04:27.070 --> 04:34.250
it looks like Alpha and Omega

04:30.830 --> 04:37.850
in those days Christ has said I am the

04:34.250 --> 04:42.260
Alpha and I am the Omega Ganesha is all

04:37.850 --> 04:45.520
right up to a point and then it is

04:42.260 --> 04:48.410
important we must pray to his

04:45.520 --> 04:50.710
incarnation that is Christ he is the

04:48.410 --> 04:56.060
source

04:50.710 --> 04:58.790
he is the potential of Christ all this

04:56.060 --> 05:01.700
falls in the divine plan done with

04:58.790 --> 05:03.979
divine discretion everything was done so

05:01.700 --> 05:06.139
beautifully but as I told you

05:03.979 --> 05:09.200
human beings are good at massacring

05:06.139 --> 05:11.750
anything that is beautiful and that's

05:09.200 --> 05:14.990
how it has happened it's very very sad

05:11.750 --> 05:19.520
we have to decide that he is to be born

05:14.990 --> 05:21.710
within us again in a proper way that

05:19.520 --> 05:25.130
he's the Alpha and the Omega

05:21.710 --> 05:27.850
at that time of his time I didn't know

05:25.130 --> 05:31.100
that anybody knew about these symbols

05:27.850 --> 05:33.970
these symbols also must have come from

05:31.100 --> 05:38.030
unconscious to some of the great

05:33.970 --> 05:41.300
mathematicians in long time and that's

05:38.030 --> 05:48.050
why these symbols are used exactly like

05:41.300 --> 05:51.430
Alpha and Omega you see him clearly it

05:48.050 --> 05:54.770
is so clear-cut now in surgeon we can

05:51.430 --> 05:57.710
prove so many things all tangible how

05:54.770 --> 05:58.070
Christ used to cure people what did he

05:57.710 --> 06:01.280
do

05:58.070 --> 06:05.539
it's all tangible we can prove it now in

06:01.280 --> 06:09.770
search of how it works how these powers

06:05.539 --> 06:14.740
work but we have to first of all cleanse

06:09.770 --> 06:19.060
our lives we have to lead a very honest

06:14.740 --> 06:19.060
powerful and pure

06:19.090 --> 06:29.539
so the first thing of Ganesha is that

06:22.430 --> 06:32.600
wisdom and that wisdom we see in the

06:29.539 --> 06:36.470
life of Christ from the very beginning

06:32.600 --> 06:39.759
it was so confident of it that at the

06:36.470 --> 06:45.080
age of 12 years he went and talked to

06:39.759 --> 06:48.470
these FARC's while he went and argued

06:45.080 --> 06:51.979
with them at that young age and he was

06:48.470 --> 06:55.039
be saying what are you doing here what

06:51.979 --> 06:59.539
is this what are you talking all

06:55.039 --> 07:02.210
lip-service he was discussing and

06:59.539 --> 07:05.570
talking to them but his parents were

07:02.210 --> 07:07.280
perhaps frightened that these people

07:05.570 --> 07:10.729
might kill him so they brought him to

07:07.280 --> 07:18.680
India he came to India for wisdom and we

07:10.729 --> 07:20.990
have lots of memories about him even the

07:18.680 --> 07:24.789
king shall even I met him is described

07:20.990 --> 07:27.500
in his book that he met a man in Kashmir

07:24.789 --> 07:33.160
who was very saintly in he asked him

07:27.500 --> 07:33.160
what's your name he said my name is ISA

07:33.280 --> 07:43.570
see now imagine ISA e is the word used

07:37.849 --> 07:47.570
in Vedas for the addition some Innsmouth

07:43.570 --> 07:51.289
he said my name is ISA said from what

07:47.570 --> 07:54.229
country you come he said I come from a

07:51.289 --> 07:55.780
country which is foreign to me and this

07:54.229 --> 07:59.590
is my country

07:55.780 --> 08:03.710
so this India the Bharat the Hindustan

07:59.590 --> 08:07.300
was the country of spirituality that's

08:03.710 --> 08:10.099
for Christ's sake this is my old country

08:07.300 --> 08:12.800
is clearly written that means Christ

08:10.099 --> 08:18.020
recognized that this country our

08:12.800 --> 08:22.099
spirituality is his own so we belong to

08:18.020 --> 08:25.280
that country of spirituality and not to

08:22.099 --> 08:28.320
the materialistic or to the mundane or

08:25.280 --> 08:34.700
the baser type of life

08:28.320 --> 08:34.700
in his lifetime which was so very short

08:36.260 --> 08:46.280
whatever he has said every word is great

08:40.669 --> 08:50.250
but as I told you that this fall tried

08:46.280 --> 08:53.310
to completely change read it the Bible

08:50.250 --> 08:56.040
and his faith put lots of things in

08:53.310 --> 08:59.220
there whatever weakness is yes he has

08:56.040 --> 09:05.100
put them nicely now recently I have got

08:59.220 --> 09:08.670
a book which was hidden in a jar in

09:05.100 --> 09:12.210
Egypt for about till 50 years they

09:08.670 --> 09:14.430
discovered it and this book is called at

09:12.210 --> 09:17.850
the library of Hammadi the place was

09:14.430 --> 09:20.340
called homily where it was discourse and

09:17.850 --> 09:22.320
what Christ has said what Thomas has

09:20.340 --> 09:24.150
written when Thomas was coming to India

09:22.320 --> 09:26.970
he put all these things there is very

09:24.150 --> 09:30.570
interesting about drinking he said

09:26.970 --> 09:34.400
drinking begets debauched is a bad word

09:30.570 --> 09:37.940
to use and while Christians don't know

09:34.400 --> 09:40.590
on the contrary think they think that

09:37.940 --> 09:44.150
drinking is allowed in Christianity very

09:40.590 --> 09:47.040
nicely was he mad to allow drinking

09:44.150 --> 09:51.060
how can he allow drinking which goes

09:47.040 --> 09:55.260
against your awareness and the basic

09:51.060 --> 09:58.500
thing of Christ's life is morality he is

09:55.260 --> 10:01.110
on the left side as you say from Shri

09:58.500 --> 10:07.020
Ganesha and then he establishes himself

10:01.110 --> 10:12.270
addict ugly but morality is the essence

10:07.020 --> 10:14.100
of his life we endure into all kinds of

10:12.270 --> 10:17.450
francis i mean if you go to the west

10:14.100 --> 10:27.050
you'll be amazed what things they do

10:17.450 --> 10:27.050
such an impurity such a horrible

10:27.650 --> 10:35.070
destructive immorality

10:31.010 --> 10:36.660
now it is for you to decide you have to

10:35.070 --> 10:40.910
pull out all these people in your own

10:36.660 --> 10:40.910
countries and you have to tell them

10:41.020 --> 10:46.440
this is all nonsense in the name of

10:42.820 --> 10:46.440
Christ in the name of God

10:46.530 --> 10:54.280
so they another quality of Croatia is

10:50.950 --> 11:04.030
shown in Christ's life is the devotion

10:54.280 --> 11:08.880
to mother in that book they Mary is

11:04.030 --> 11:15.640
telling them about knowledge but this

11:08.880 --> 11:19.090
Paul objects to it when she says that

11:15.640 --> 11:22.230
this is what you have to achieve when he

11:19.090 --> 11:29.470
doesn't want to he is arguing with her

11:22.230 --> 11:32.640
but then Thomas said that what Christ

11:29.470 --> 11:36.970
has said on the cross behold the mother

11:32.640 --> 11:41.410
she is the mother of Christ and how dare

11:36.970 --> 11:49.890
he insult but just the opposite Paul

11:41.410 --> 11:54.340
never respected women so he appointed

11:49.890 --> 12:00.250
and he called her as just a woman no

11:54.340 --> 12:05.170
respect for Mahalakshmi no respect so we

12:00.250 --> 12:10.330
have to within ourselves see if we have

12:05.170 --> 12:13.870
developed that purity of mind that

12:10.330 --> 12:17.050
expresses through our eyes eyes have to

12:13.870 --> 12:21.550
become innocent otherwise they have no

12:17.050 --> 12:26.590
effect as sahaja Yogi's you have to have

12:21.550 --> 12:29.740
the light of Christ in your own life he

12:26.590 --> 12:34.780
was a young man who came on this earth

12:29.740 --> 12:38.460
and how he did he had nothing to do with

12:34.780 --> 12:41.980
Mary Magdalene II who was a prostitute

12:38.460 --> 12:45.820
but he stood by truth and when people

12:41.980 --> 12:49.470
started stoning her he stood up and said

12:45.820 --> 12:54.900
those who have not committed any sin can

12:49.470 --> 12:59.140
throw the stone at water strength

12:54.900 --> 13:03.460
so not that only he was a pure

12:59.140 --> 13:08.350
personality but purity also is expressed

13:03.460 --> 13:12.310
in truth and his compassion and such

13:08.350 --> 13:15.970
compassion he has experienced such

13:12.310 --> 13:19.360
compassion I think our nation

13:15.970 --> 13:22.950
coordinated transformation stagnation is

13:19.360 --> 13:28.360
definitely very compassionate to people

13:22.950 --> 13:32.260
who are worshipping Him but those who

13:28.360 --> 13:37.270
goal against them he hits the heart he

13:32.260 --> 13:43.860
doesn't spare they have to suffer 8 days

13:37.270 --> 13:47.650
that everything comes but those who are

13:43.860 --> 13:50.460
few people Shri Ganesha protects but

13:47.650 --> 13:52.870
Christ is compassionate he forgives

13:50.460 --> 13:57.790
because he believes that there could be

13:52.870 --> 14:02.410
a transformation at the level of Shri

13:57.790 --> 14:05.310
Ganesha he thinks is better that let

14:02.410 --> 14:08.620
them be killed and be born again

14:05.310 --> 14:12.130
because those so impure but Christ had

14:08.620 --> 14:18.100
hopes that he can transform people they

14:12.130 --> 14:19.990
could not they crucified what wonderful

14:18.100 --> 14:22.170
people they must have been to crucify

14:19.990 --> 14:26.970
Christ

14:22.170 --> 14:29.950
brainless we should call them absolutely

14:26.970 --> 14:36.580
without any understanding about

14:29.950 --> 14:41.320
spirituality very insensitive to true

14:36.580 --> 14:45.280
knowledge so far sahaja yoga only the

14:41.320 --> 14:48.400
wise can follow it is not when for

14:45.280 --> 14:53.260
stupid idiotic people nor it is meant

14:48.400 --> 14:56.260
for very smart ones some people think a

14:53.260 --> 14:58.990
very smart because they're successful in

14:56.260 --> 15:02.190
life they can say some smart sentences

14:58.990 --> 15:06.850
they can say something very

15:02.190 --> 15:11.029
outstandingly very sharp start meant

15:06.850 --> 15:16.510
for that price to set me in heart will

15:11.029 --> 15:20.149
inherit the earth you have to be meat

15:16.510 --> 15:22.490
you have to be wise with wisdom you will

15:20.149 --> 15:28.180
become meek because then you will see

15:22.490 --> 15:31.459
where are we into this great cosmos that

15:28.180 --> 15:36.130
you will feel that you have entered into

15:31.459 --> 15:39.490
this kingdom of God true for what how

15:36.130 --> 15:43.910
how is it suddenly we got this blessing

15:39.490 --> 15:47.959
how are we then when we start looking at

15:43.910 --> 15:51.980
this we become meek but this is about it

15:47.959 --> 15:54.380
is Christ as meek in heart there's a

15:51.980 --> 15:56.540
very big word meek and people don't

15:54.380 --> 15:58.610
understand me because in the West if you

15:56.540 --> 16:01.670
are meek people say you are weak you

15:58.610 --> 16:06.440
have to be aggressive so in dealing in

16:01.670 --> 16:08.690
sahaja yoga the sweetness of natural

16:06.440 --> 16:13.970
meekness not an artificial of a

16:08.690 --> 16:19.959
businessman but a natural one that makes

16:13.970 --> 16:23.779
you shine with your great great

16:19.959 --> 16:26.690
spirituality so can we come to the

16:23.779 --> 16:32.529
Kurama saying as Christ I said know

16:26.690 --> 16:41.779
thyself first and foremost thing of

16:32.529 --> 16:44.630
introspection is know thyself what you

16:41.779 --> 16:49.820
are doing are you trying to look at

16:44.630 --> 16:57.040
yourself or not he has also said that we

16:49.820 --> 17:00.649
see a big beam into the eyes of others

16:57.040 --> 17:03.380
then it's alright but the beam is in

17:00.649 --> 17:09.949
your eyes and you start seeing the beam

17:03.380 --> 17:12.679
in other size and that's the point is so

17:09.949 --> 17:15.850
in your meditation you have to sit down

17:12.679 --> 17:19.390
and first of all introspect for Christ

17:15.850 --> 17:22.480
or Shri Ganesha please give me

17:19.390 --> 17:28.630
to see myself and understand what's

17:22.480 --> 17:34.090
wrong with and understand where do I

17:28.630 --> 17:36.390
lack all the qualities of a good

17:34.090 --> 17:36.390
searcher

17:36.660 --> 17:46.000
just to meditate and you'll feel so

17:39.580 --> 17:47.580
happy so choice because virtue within

17:46.000 --> 17:51.810
you gives you joy

17:47.580 --> 17:54.480
so introspection is very important

17:51.810 --> 17:56.710
criticizing others should be less

17:54.480 --> 17:59.230
criticizing yourself and laughing at

17:56.710 --> 18:01.360
yourself visible I laugh at myself many

17:59.230 --> 18:03.850
a times and say many things like that if

18:01.360 --> 18:09.580
you have noticed it that makes life so

18:03.850 --> 18:12.850
interesting that will kill your ego how

18:09.580 --> 18:14.650
I am trying to assert myself and where

18:12.850 --> 18:19.510
is the meekness that Christ has talked

18:14.650 --> 18:25.930
about this is a natural goodness within

18:19.510 --> 18:28.870
us once it shines and shows it becomes

18:25.930 --> 18:30.970
so beautiful so loveable whether you are

18:28.870 --> 18:37.960
sitting here and near me or there I know

18:30.970 --> 18:42.090
who is that guy my heart just opens for

18:37.960 --> 18:45.450
such a personality I know who they are

18:42.090 --> 18:50.710
but even if I know I will never tell you

18:45.450 --> 18:56.650
it is better that you know yourself know

18:50.710 --> 18:58.870
thyself is his message in a real way not

18:56.650 --> 19:02.770
with deception because you are deceiving

18:58.870 --> 19:08.400
yourself whom are you deceiving know

19:02.770 --> 19:15.130
thyself without any deception without

19:08.400 --> 19:18.970
any lies with full concentration see

19:15.130 --> 19:21.280
where is your attention going that's how

19:18.970 --> 19:23.230
you are going to rise you are not going

19:21.280 --> 19:25.720
to rise by seeing the defects of others

19:23.230 --> 19:28.500
but you are going to rise only by seeing

19:25.720 --> 19:28.500
your own difference

19:28.870 --> 19:36.159
exactly this what Christ has said I'm

19:31.730 --> 19:39.529
telling you in very very simple words

19:36.159 --> 19:40.460
then he has said love thy neighbor as

19:39.529 --> 19:43.100
thyself

19:40.460 --> 19:45.580
which is a very very big thing to say

19:43.100 --> 19:49.970
now is only possible in sahaja yoga

19:45.580 --> 19:53.059
because you are collective you are also

19:49.970 --> 19:55.549
collective so moral so beautiful no

19:53.059 --> 19:58.639
complications nothing I'm so or joy to

19:55.549 --> 20:02.600
see but to make it perfect

19:58.639 --> 20:05.620
we should introspect we have to

20:02.600 --> 20:08.889
celebrate because really such a great

20:05.620 --> 20:11.950
amount of work was done by Christ

20:08.889 --> 20:15.730
through your life you can express it

20:11.950 --> 20:22.629
through the purity through the meekness

20:15.730 --> 20:22.629
through the compassion and the wisdom

20:23.830 --> 20:32.000
absolutely fearless was and that's why

20:28.460 --> 20:35.799
you have to be fearless because you have

20:32.000 --> 20:38.720
to be only afraid of God and nobody else

20:35.799 --> 20:40.159
that's all and if you have done nothing

20:38.720 --> 20:47.389
wrong there's nothing to be afraid of

20:40.159 --> 20:51.830
God also because he loves so we

20:47.389 --> 20:57.200
clear-cut about everything be

20:51.830 --> 21:00.169
understanding you are all lovable people

20:57.200 --> 21:02.950
no doubt but you should be such that you

21:00.169 --> 21:07.220
can adorn yourself and love yourself

21:02.950 --> 21:09.460
because of the virtues you may God bless

21:07.220 --> 21:09.460
you

21:09.870 --> 21:20.779
