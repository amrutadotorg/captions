00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:17.990
I must have said lots of things about

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:23.029
Christ before and how Jesus Christ is

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:27.619
created to steal a [ __ ] that he is the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:31.849
incarnation of Shri Ganesha who was the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.750
son of the Adi Shakti to begin with but

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:39.320
then he was given to stay detached and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.649
shri radha created as Mahalakshmi as

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:48.140
mother Mary this great incarnation of

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:50.239
Christ now for the Western mind it is

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.730
impossible to understand how there can

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.190
be a Immaculate Conception because they

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.249
have no sense at all no sensitive attack

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.909
at all to spiritual life we Indians can

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:04.880
understand it it's very easy for Indians

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.980
to understand because we had Shri

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.200
Ganesha created that way we just believe

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.180
it we don't doubt these things whatever

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.000
he said about God is not to be doubted

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.650
with this limited brain that's not done

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.250
in India but in the West from the very

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.770
birth of Christ they have had arguments

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.350
arguments arguments arguments with this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:33.500
limited brain they had his purity his

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.380
holiness his auspiciousness it's never

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.770
understood in the West I think the first

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:45.830
and foremost thing he has said that you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:49.550
must enter into the kingdom of God that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.410
you must be born again so it's all

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.460
mental you are born again you have a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:00.110
certificate we are born again finished

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:07.569
so this mental attitude of the West is

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:08.960
responsible for killing the great

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.910
incarnation of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.410
Christ I think is another crucifixion

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.130
mentally you cannot understand

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:25.130
spirituality so as it is there made a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:29.870
mess of all the great incarnations but

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.880
worst is done to Christ and I feel what

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:40.280
a waste it was so we must understand

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:44.590
Christ in the right sense he is the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.860
eternal child he is the innocence itself

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.440
he's the source of innocence and he is

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.000
the Beast over of all blessings in all

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.780
chakras now one has to understand that

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.100
how Christ at his miraculous life has

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:08.990
shown so many miracles first of all his

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:13.130
birth was immaculate they are beyond

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.230
since their special people they may come

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.930
as human beings they may come as angels

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.750
they may come as anything they are

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.780
divine and we should understand that

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.310
this little brain of ours cannot discuss

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:31.390
about them and talk about them but is to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.690
just surrender and worship them

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.090
they are much beyond us so for the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.780
Western mind it is important to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.720
understand that the life of Christ was

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.630
such a blessing for them that they have

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.430
lost it they have wasted it and they

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.740
have never understood how to respect it

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:58.480
I had told you long time back that how

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.360
we can prove that Christ was Ganesha and

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.840
he was the logos he was the what we call

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.440
is the Brahma not the first sound

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.000
by looking at your left side from the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.780
right side if you see the mooladhara you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.049
will see swastikas because it is made of

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:25.040
carbonate if you see from left to the

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.070
right you can see all Ghana and if you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.830
see from down upward

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.250
it looks like Alpha and Omega

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.850
in those days Christ has said I am the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.260
Alpha and I am the Omega Ganesha is all

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.520
right up to a point and then it is

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.410
important we must pray to his

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.710
incarnation that is Christ he is the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:56.060
source

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.790
he is the potential of Christ all this

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.700
falls in the divine plan done with

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.979
divine discretion everything was done so

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.139
beautifully but as I told you

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.200
human beings are good at massacring

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.750
anything that is beautiful and that's

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.990
how it has happened it's very very sad

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.520
we have to decide that he is to be born

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.710
within us again in a proper way that

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.130
he's the Alpha and the Omega

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.850
at that time of his time I didn't know

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.100
that anybody knew about these symbols

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.970
these symbols also must have come from

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.030
unconscious to some of the great

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:41.300
mathematicians in long time and that's

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:48.050
why these symbols are used exactly like

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:51.430
Alpha and Omega you see him clearly it

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.770
is so clear-cut now in surgeon we can

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.710
prove so many things all tangible how

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.070
Christ used to cure people what did he

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.280
do

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:05.539
it's all tangible we can prove it now in

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:09.770
search of how it works how these powers

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:14.740
work but we have to first of all cleanse

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:19.060
our lives we have to lead a very honest

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.060
powerful and pure

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:29.539
so the first thing of Ganesha is that

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:32.600
wisdom and that wisdom we see in the

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:36.470
life of Christ from the very beginning

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:39.759
it was so confident of it that at the

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:45.080
age of 12 years he went and talked to

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:48.470
these FARC's while he went and argued

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.979
with them at that young age and he was

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:55.039
be saying what are you doing here what

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:59.539
is this what are you talking all

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:02.210
lip-service he was discussing and

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:05.570
talking to them but his parents were

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.280
perhaps frightened that these people

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.729
might kill him so they brought him to

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:18.680
India he came to India for wisdom and we

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:20.990
have lots of memories about him even the

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.789
king shall even I met him is described

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:27.500
in his book that he met a man in Kashmir

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:33.160
who was very saintly in he asked him

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.160
what's your name he said my name is ISA

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:43.570
see now imagine ISA e is the word used

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:47.570
in Vedas for the addition some Innsmouth

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:51.289
he said my name is ISA said from what

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:54.229
country you come he said I come from a

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.780
country which is foreign to me and this

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:59.590
is my country

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:03.710
so this India the Bharat the Hindustan

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:07.300
was the country of spirituality that's

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:10.099
for Christ's sake this is my old country

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.800
is clearly written that means Christ

00:08:10.099 --> 00:08:18.020
recognized that this country our

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:22.099
spirituality is his own so we belong to

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:25.280
that country of spirituality and not to

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:28.320
the materialistic or to the mundane or

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:34.700
the baser type of life

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.700
in his lifetime which was so very short

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:46.280
whatever he has said every word is great

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:50.250
but as I told you that this fall tried

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.310
to completely change read it the Bible

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:56.040
and his faith put lots of things in

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:59.220
there whatever weakness is yes he has

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:05.100
put them nicely now recently I have got

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:08.670
a book which was hidden in a jar in

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:12.210
Egypt for about till 50 years they

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.430
discovered it and this book is called at

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:17.850
the library of Hammadi the place was

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:20.340
called homily where it was discourse and

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:22.320
what Christ has said what Thomas has

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.150
written when Thomas was coming to India

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.970
he put all these things there is very

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:30.570
interesting about drinking he said

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:34.400
drinking begets debauched is a bad word

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:37.940
to use and while Christians don't know

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.590
on the contrary think they think that

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.150
drinking is allowed in Christianity very

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:47.040
nicely was he mad to allow drinking

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:51.060
how can he allow drinking which goes

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:55.260
against your awareness and the basic

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:58.500
thing of Christ's life is morality he is

00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:01.110
on the left side as you say from Shri

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:07.020
Ganesha and then he establishes himself

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:12.270
addict ugly but morality is the essence

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:14.100
of his life we endure into all kinds of

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:17.450
francis i mean if you go to the west

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:27.050
you'll be amazed what things they do

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:27.050
such an impurity such a horrible

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:35.070
destructive immorality

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:36.660
now it is for you to decide you have to

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.910
pull out all these people in your own

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.910
countries and you have to tell them

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:46.440
this is all nonsense in the name of

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.440
Christ in the name of God

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:54.280
so they another quality of Croatia is

00:10:50.950 --> 00:11:04.030
shown in Christ's life is the devotion

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:08.880
to mother in that book they Mary is

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:15.640
telling them about knowledge but this

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:19.090
Paul objects to it when she says that

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:22.230
this is what you have to achieve when he

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:29.470
doesn't want to he is arguing with her

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:32.640
but then Thomas said that what Christ

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:36.970
has said on the cross behold the mother

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:41.410
she is the mother of Christ and how dare

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:49.890
he insult but just the opposite Paul

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:54.340
never respected women so he appointed

00:11:49.890 --> 00:12:00.250
and he called her as just a woman no

00:11:54.340 --> 00:12:05.170
respect for Mahalakshmi no respect so we

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:10.330
have to within ourselves see if we have

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:13.870
developed that purity of mind that

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:17.050
expresses through our eyes eyes have to

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:21.550
become innocent otherwise they have no

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:26.590
effect as sahaja Yogi's you have to have

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:29.740
the light of Christ in your own life he

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:34.780
was a young man who came on this earth

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:38.460
and how he did he had nothing to do with

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:41.980
Mary Magdalene II who was a prostitute

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:45.820
but he stood by truth and when people

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:49.470
started stoning her he stood up and said

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:54.900
those who have not committed any sin can

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:59.140
throw the stone at water strength

00:12:54.900 --> 00:13:03.460
so not that only he was a pure

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:08.350
personality but purity also is expressed

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:12.310
in truth and his compassion and such

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:15.970
compassion he has experienced such

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.360
compassion I think our nation

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:22.950
coordinated transformation stagnation is

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:28.360
definitely very compassionate to people

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:32.260
who are worshipping Him but those who

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:37.270
goal against them he hits the heart he

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:43.860
doesn't spare they have to suffer 8 days

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:47.650
that everything comes but those who are

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:50.460
few people Shri Ganesha protects but

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.870
Christ is compassionate he forgives

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:57.790
because he believes that there could be

00:13:52.870 --> 00:14:02.410
a transformation at the level of Shri

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:05.310
Ganesha he thinks is better that let

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:08.620
them be killed and be born again

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:12.130
because those so impure but Christ had

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:18.100
hopes that he can transform people they

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:19.990
could not they crucified what wonderful

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.170
people they must have been to crucify

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:26.970
Christ

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:29.950
brainless we should call them absolutely

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:36.580
without any understanding about

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:41.320
spirituality very insensitive to true

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:45.280
knowledge so far sahaja yoga only the

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:48.400
wise can follow it is not when for

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:53.260
stupid idiotic people nor it is meant

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:56.260
for very smart ones some people think a

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.990
very smart because they're successful in

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.190
life they can say some smart sentences

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:06.850
they can say something very

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:11.029
outstandingly very sharp start meant

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:16.510
for that price to set me in heart will

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:20.149
inherit the earth you have to be meat

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:22.490
you have to be wise with wisdom you will

00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:28.180
become meek because then you will see

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:31.459
where are we into this great cosmos that

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:36.130
you will feel that you have entered into

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:39.490
this kingdom of God true for what how

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:43.910
how is it suddenly we got this blessing

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:47.959
how are we then when we start looking at

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:51.980
this we become meek but this is about it

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:54.380
is Christ as meek in heart there's a

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.540
very big word meek and people don't

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.610
understand me because in the West if you

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.670
are meek people say you are weak you

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:06.440
have to be aggressive so in dealing in

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:08.690
sahaja yoga the sweetness of natural

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:13.970
meekness not an artificial of a

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:19.959
businessman but a natural one that makes

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:23.779
you shine with your great great

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:26.690
spirituality so can we come to the

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:32.529
Kurama saying as Christ I said know

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:41.779
thyself first and foremost thing of

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:44.630
introspection is know thyself what you

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:49.820
are doing are you trying to look at

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:57.040
yourself or not he has also said that we

00:16:49.820 --> 00:17:00.649
see a big beam into the eyes of others

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.380
then it's alright but the beam is in

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:09.949
your eyes and you start seeing the beam

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:12.679
in other size and that's the point is so

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:15.850
in your meditation you have to sit down

00:17:12.679 --> 00:17:19.390
and first of all introspect for Christ

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:22.480
or Shri Ganesha please give me

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:28.630
to see myself and understand what's

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:34.090
wrong with and understand where do I

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:36.390
lack all the qualities of a good

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.390
searcher

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:46.000
just to meditate and you'll feel so

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:47.580
happy so choice because virtue within

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.810
you gives you joy

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:54.480
so introspection is very important

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:56.710
criticizing others should be less

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.230
criticizing yourself and laughing at

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.360
yourself visible I laugh at myself many

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:03.850
a times and say many things like that if

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:09.580
you have noticed it that makes life so

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:12.850
interesting that will kill your ego how

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:14.650
I am trying to assert myself and where

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:19.510
is the meekness that Christ has talked

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:25.930
about this is a natural goodness within

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:28.870
us once it shines and shows it becomes

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.970
so beautiful so loveable whether you are

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:37.960
sitting here and near me or there I know

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:42.090
who is that guy my heart just opens for

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:45.450
such a personality I know who they are

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:50.710
but even if I know I will never tell you

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:56.650
it is better that you know yourself know

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:58.870
thyself is his message in a real way not

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:02.770
with deception because you are deceiving

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:08.400
yourself whom are you deceiving know

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:15.130
thyself without any deception without

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:18.970
any lies with full concentration see

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:21.280
where is your attention going that's how

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.230
you are going to rise you are not going

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.720
to rise by seeing the defects of others

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:28.500
but you are going to rise only by seeing

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.500
your own difference

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:36.159
exactly this what Christ has said I'm

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:39.529
telling you in very very simple words

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:40.460
then he has said love thy neighbor as

00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:43.100
thyself

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.580
which is a very very big thing to say

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:49.970
now is only possible in sahaja yoga

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:53.059
because you are collective you are also

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:55.549
collective so moral so beautiful no

00:19:53.059 --> 00:19:58.639
complications nothing I'm so or joy to

00:19:55.549 --> 00:20:02.600
see but to make it perfect

00:19:58.639 --> 00:20:05.620
we should introspect we have to

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:08.889
celebrate because really such a great

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:11.950
amount of work was done by Christ

00:20:08.889 --> 00:20:15.730
through your life you can express it

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:22.629
through the purity through the meekness

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:22.629
through the compassion and the wisdom

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:32.000
absolutely fearless was and that's why

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:35.799
you have to be fearless because you have

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.720
to be only afraid of God and nobody else

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:40.159
that's all and if you have done nothing

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:47.389
wrong there's nothing to be afraid of

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:51.830
God also because he loves so we

00:20:47.389 --> 00:20:57.200
clear-cut about everything be

00:20:51.830 --> 00:21:00.169
understanding you are all lovable people

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.950
no doubt but you should be such that you

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:07.220
can adorn yourself and love yourself

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.460
because of the virtues you may God bless

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.460
you

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:20.779
