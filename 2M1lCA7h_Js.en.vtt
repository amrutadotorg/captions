Archive audio: H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi at Birthday Puja 1970 0321 in Mumbai (India).

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.892
1970-0101 Birthday Puja Mumbai NC Different Source NITL HD

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:23.892
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It is very kind of you all to have come to celebrate my birthday.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.892
It’s all your goodness. In modern times, who looks after the mother?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.892
One of the signs of modern times is that the parents will be neglected by the children.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.892
They may have to stay in an orphanage.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:04.892
But I find all of you here with such love, with such affection, all the way from all distances,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:17.892
you have come to greet your Mother. Words stop at this point.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:34.892
I cannot understand the love that is pouring so much like an ocean over Me.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:51.892
I just get lost into the beautiful feeling of a Mother who has thousands of children,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:04.892
who are so kind and also after my image of a good son or a good daughter.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.892
We had another great mother here, in this Maharashtra, was Jijabai, Jija Mata.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.892
And she is the one she had  an image [unsure] of her son, that one day her son

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:38.892
will be able to establish the kingdom of God, of honesty, of freedom, of character.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.892
Such ” Yuvapurushas” are born in many years.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.892
Even his son could not come up to his standard, to his character.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.892
The way he respected the daughter-in-law of Kalyan Subhedar, the way  he came towards people,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.892
the way he led a life of dynamic bhakti.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:19.892
Such people are rarely born and he could not even create someone like him.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:33.892
But today, I am so very fortunate to have children of your great character,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:46.892
understanding and such spiritual values. Sahaja Yoga has created a new culture of spiritual value.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:59.892
The value system has taken a funny shape in the modern times

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.892
but in these modern times only when the shackles of this horrible culture -

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.892
whether you call it eastern, western, modern, ancient, anything,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.892
because all of them have gone to the collapsible stages.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.892
One finds a new culture, a new life, a new age of a new race coming up.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:44.892
I am so gratified that you are all here to represent that culture of spiritual values,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:59.892
where we do not believe in any separatist ideals. We are not reactions.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:11.892
We do not react to any concept. We are self-made, standing on our self-experiences and the truth,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:24.892
that is so evident. We are not the people who have taken to a kind of a violent

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:37.892
or peaceful - if you call it - reaction to the society. Like we have many organizations today I find,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.892
“This is a reaction to this, that is a reaction to that”.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.892
This is not the society that is demanding anything like money,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.892
power - nor is it a society that calls itself a downtrodden or underprivileged people.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.892
It is the most privileged society we have today [unsure].

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.892
The essence of this privilege is that you are all Yogis, you are all saints, you are all Safiyas [pure].

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.892
That there is satisfaction in your heart, that now the time has come to give,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.892
no more asking for oil or for light. What you have got is the light and the oil all the time flowing in you.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.892
You have to just spread this love into the whole world.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:46.892
Such confidence of love, such modesty of dynamism, such sharpness of compassion,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:57.892
such deep peace. Its prevalent in the society of Sahaja Yogis:

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:10.892
the friendship, the love like many waves of beautiful thoughts and feelings.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:20.892
This ocean of a new understanding of a higher life, of a sober life,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:30.892
of a sublime life has to break all the barriers, all the nonsensical work.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:41.892
Today we are facing face-to-face, thank God. Due to fundamentalist, due to fanatics,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.892
due to non-believers, due to politicians, economics, scientists, all of them,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.892
who are conditioned by whatever false path they have created.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.892
Scientists are very much more conditioned than anybody else.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.892
They just refuse to accept that there is God Almighty above us.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.892
They are not scientists, because they have no open-mindedness.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.892
If you don’t have an open-mindedness, you are not a scientist.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.892
Now the time has come for you to prove the existence of God and His realm,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.892
which gives us security, peace and joy.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.892
About Kundalini - I don’t know how many lectures I’ve given and have worked it in so many ways

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.892
that it should be appreciated, understood, knowledgeable to all of you.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.892
Only the knowledge of Kundalini is not going to help us at all.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.892
You might find some people who have much more knowledge of Kundalini than some of you have.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.892
They might have read at least hundred books on Kundalini,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.892
but it is not known to them, its not the knowledge. It has to be within [unsure],

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.892
it has to be known on your central nervous system. It has to be in your being,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.892
that you should be able to know what is Kundalini.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.892
As soon as you see somebody you should know where he stands - as far as spirituality is concerned.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:26.892
As soon as you feel the atmosphere, you should know where you are as far as God’s realm is concerned.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.892
I must tell you a story. Once I was travelling with my husband in Kashmir

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.892
and just in a very wild place, I felt tremendous vibrations.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.892
And I said, “From where do these vibrations are coming?” So, my husband said,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.892
“How can you have vibrations in this forlorn place?” He asked the driver. He said,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.892
“No, there is no temple, nothing here, it’s a very wild place.”

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.892
I said, “All right, let’s go the way this road is”. And we went one way ahead,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.892
about five miles and there, some Muslims, poor Muslims were living there.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.892
So, the driver asked them, is there a temple here? They said,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.892
“No, there is no temple. But about a mile ahead there is the Hazratbal (Mosque).”

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.892
Hazratbal was the one hair of Mohammad Sahab. Can you imagine the vibrations?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.892
I caught them about 5-6 miles away, from one hair of Mohammad Sahab.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.892
When we deny Mohammad, or when we deny Christ, when we deny Krishna

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.892
or we deny Dattatreya, we are denying the truth, because they are all one. There’s no difference.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:04.892
They are like flowers on one tree of life. We are not their judge. They are our judge.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.892
We are not to judge them, we haven‘t got that capacity to judge them.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.892
What capacity we have, that we have to achieve, that we have to reach, that has to mature.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.892
The spirituality has to mature to that extent where it Hazrat Nizamudin

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.892
or it is Chishti or it is Sainath. You should see nothing but Dattatreya  present in them.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.892
For that you have to have that sight of Kabira.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.892
You have to have that growth of Nanaka. Otherwise, we just talk.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.892
Those who have understood Sahaja Yoga have understood that all

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.892
these barriers of religion has no meaning. It‘s all integrated,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.892
well-woven and worked out beautifully by sending all these Incarnations,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.892
all these Great Prophets on this Earth. To create the humanity which is described by Confucius.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.892
To create valencies, our valencies, which are 10 valencies that we call as Dharma,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.892
of a human Dharma, which is described by Confucius.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.892
It is described in different, different ways no doubt, but still, he says the same thing, same tone.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.892
As I said this morning Sahaja Yoga has only one theme and that is pure love.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.892
It has no greed, it has no lust, it has no ambitions, nothing!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.892
It has nothing but pure love flowing through your channels to the whole world.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.892
I hope we have achieved a very great height [unsure].

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.892
To think that we have people from all over the world who follow this path of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.892
Now it is for others to see whether they can come up through all this turmoil [unsure]

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.892
because Sahaja Yoga is not a thing where you can be a member,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.892
you can pay some money or you can sort of put a sign-board that I am a Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.892
Its the becoming of Sahaja Yoga is important. Those who have that capacity will come to us.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.892
Don’t you worry if the whole world doesn’t come. For Me, you are the world.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.892
Those who want to come, can join us and can enjoy themselves, can have that.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.892
We cannot run after them, we cannot fall at their feet, that come along - take to God.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.892
Let them themselves come on their own and enjoy the beauty of their own being,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.892
which is created by God specially for them.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:53.892
Today, I must say that every year, the age reduces in a way

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:05.892
because you are going towards your goal. But one has to remember that every year you mature.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.892
You mature like a seed comes up to a tree, then becomes a flower and ultimately a fruit.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.892
And the fruit has to fall again to the ground, to give the resurgence of the same.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.892
In the same way whatever it is, whether the time is passing, one has to just judge

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.892
how far have I matured in compassion, in love, in understanding of the truth.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.892
How far I can stand against all the atrocities done to others who are suffering.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.892
We have to open our eyes to the society, to our surroundings, to our country, to other countries,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.892
to everyone. We have to be alert. It’s not to be enjoyed only by you.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.892
It is to be given to others and for that those who come to us,  we have to tell them.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.892
I am sure one day will come many will open their eyes and see for themselves

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.892
that the only solution for this world’s turmoil is Self Realisation, to know the Self,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.892
that still they are not fully there yet.  Once it happens I am sure,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.892
I am very, very sure that this world will become a beautiful garden of oneness.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.892
May God bless you all!

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.892
Indian Sahaja Yogi: By the grace of Shri Mataji, it has, all they have teached is

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.892
that one must read [unsure] everyday regarding this program [unsure] of Shri Mataji.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.892
May I, while passing make a remark, that Shri Mataji with Her own mantras

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.892
has given a different interpretation all together.  Shri Mataji, with Her own interpretations,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.892
has given a different, all together, meaning to Gita, Quran, what Nanak Sahab has said,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.892
and our Sahaja Yogis have been writing about it. One such, our Sudhakar,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.892
has written this strotram Nirananda and I would request Shri Mataji to have Her blessings on this,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.892
this is strotram Nirananda.  (Audience applauds)

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.892
Another Sahaja Yogi:  Most Holy Mother, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, all of us who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.892
we bow to You.  We thank You very much for having given us the  Self Realisation,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.892
for having given us what we know as love.  Today with Your shining words

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.892
You have given us depth, which we are and which we look forward to.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.892
I thank all of you who have come here today to celebrate with us,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.892
on this great occasion of Shri Mataji’s birthday.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.892
All of us who are Sahaja Yogis over here, we promise You, O Mother, that Your works,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.892
through us will carry far and to all corners of the world and with Your blessings,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:09.892
this world can be a different place.  Thank You very much. Jai Shri Mataji!
