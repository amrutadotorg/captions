1
00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:08,089
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

2
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:24,039
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

3
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,384
for different, different purposes.

4
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:41,505
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

5
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,046
who were worshipping the Mother,

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:55,469
they found out that what
She has done for us.

7
00:00:56,631 --> 00:01:00,071
The other day I told you
the dharma

8
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:07,641
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

9
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:14,520
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

10
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:19,544
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

11
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:26,880
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

12
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:35,921
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

13
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:39,670
though we are not aware of it.

14
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:45,563
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

15
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:50,746
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

16
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:58,194
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

17
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:07,083
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

18
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:16,647
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

19
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:26,933
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

20
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:34,747
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

21
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:41,585
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

22
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,456
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

23
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:51,233
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

24
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:58,528
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

25
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,877
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

26
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:08,833
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

27
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:18,901
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

28
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:26,050
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

29
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:30,327
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

30
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:36,994
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

31
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,004
So, the second one She says is:

32
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:48,016
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

33
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:52,430
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

34
00:03:52,455 --> 00:04:00,300
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

35
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,530
 But, it’s not there.

36
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:10,586
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

37
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:17,357
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

38
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,008
and some present to another one.

39
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:25,720
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

40
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:31,605
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

41
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:40,447
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

42
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:44,207
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

43
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:49,541
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

44
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:53,524
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

45
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:59,101
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

46
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:03,762
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

47
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:08,811
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

48
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:18,110
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

49
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:22,692
These so close to each other.

50
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:30,443
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

51
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:34,913
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

52
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:38,782
if You can go to that country”.

53
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,102
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

54
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:48,032
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

55
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:58,194
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

56
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:07,189
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

57
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:13,349
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

58
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:18,869
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

59
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:26,449
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

60
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:30,978
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

61
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:36,155
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

62
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,498
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

63
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:47,249
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

64
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,416
Then you must compete with others.

65
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:56,887
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

66
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:05,091
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

67
00:07:05,116 --> 00:07:13,545
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

68
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,371
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

69
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,878
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

70
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:29,437
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

71
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:33,293
Forgiveness from the heart.

72
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:38,657
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

73
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:41,639
has exploited you, has troubled you,

74
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:47,516
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

75
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:53,169
Do we use that power to forgive?

76
00:07:57,037 --> 00:08:04,601
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

77
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:09,817
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

78
00:08:09,842 --> 00:08:14,817
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

79
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:21,259
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

80
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:25,469
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

81
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:30,344
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

82
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:36,290
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

83
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,337
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

84
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:44,363
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

85
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:48,841
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

86
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:56,854
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

87
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,131
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

88
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:06,235
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

89
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:13,189
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

90
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:19,868
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

91
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:27,581
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

92
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:29,971
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

93
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:33,452
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

94
00:09:33,477 --> 00:09:37,753
But when your ego is working or...

95
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:42,317
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

96
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:47,606
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

97
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:56,850
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

98
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:04,628
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

99
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:08,403
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

100
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:12,116
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

101
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:17,958
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

102
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,459
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

103
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:26,759
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

104
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:32,628
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

105
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:38,522
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

106
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:42,645
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

107
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,217
So, Mother has to tell you.

108
00:10:51,404 --> 00:11:00,326
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

109
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:06,714
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

110
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:10,534
She puts you into delusion,

111
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,276
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

112
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:21,657
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

113
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:27,285
She allows, allows you to go wrong

114
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,006
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

115
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:35,267
Very important it is that She plays,

116
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:39,019
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

117
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:43,210
And this is discussed
in every religion

118
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:48,079
that we get lost with this delusion.

119
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:52,683
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

120
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,613
We have the delusions
of ego.

121
00:11:56,638 --> 00:12:01,891
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

122
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:08,466
 that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

123
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:12,881
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

124
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:17,747
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

125
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:26,265
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

126
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,412
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

127
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:36,498
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

128
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:41,762
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

129
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:46,154
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

130
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:53,229
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

131
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:56,317
then only you can return back.

132
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,651
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

133
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:11,935
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

134
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,700
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

135
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:23,286
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

136
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:29,321
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

137
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:32,644
It is beyond the mind.

138
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:39,677
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

139
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:47,329
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

140
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:54,283
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

141
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:58,756
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

142
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:02,814
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

143
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,283
and this connection should not
be broken,

144
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:11,396
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

145
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:15,072
All this is within us,

146
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,418
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

147
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:28,304
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

148
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:33,397
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

149
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:41,130
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

150
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:47,050
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

151
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:53,738
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:58,200
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

153
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:05,958
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

154
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,483
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

155
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:13,617
For example, it is also said that,

156
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:20,554
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

157
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:26,990
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

158
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:36,066
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

159
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:44,030
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

160
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:48,633
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

161
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:53,825
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

162
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:58,042
Lajja rupena samsthita:

163
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:04,234
means you have to have shame
of your body.

164
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:08,901
That’s specially for women.

165
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:17,557
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

166
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,638
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

167
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:23,601
That shyness gradually disappears,

168
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:27,101
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

169
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:31,561
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

170
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:36,712
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

171
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:40,691
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

172
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:45,930
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

173
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:50,811
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

174
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:55,907
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

175
00:16:55,932 --> 00:17:00,941
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

176
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:05,847
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

177
00:17:05,872 --> 00:17:09,947
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

178
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:13,281
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

179
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:16,965
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

180
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:23,850
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

181
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:31,027
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

182
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:39,757
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

183
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:47,177
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

184
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:51,994
There is no space for any artist

185
00:17:52,019 --> 00:18:01,646
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

186
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:08,711
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

187
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:12,920
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

188
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:20,588
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

189
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:26,236
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

190
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:29,887
then it is His art,

191
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:37,577
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

192
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:42,554
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

193
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,813
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

194
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:50,422
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

195
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:54,116
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

196
00:18:54,141 --> 00:19:00,367
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

197
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:06,665
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

198
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,763
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

199
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:15,980
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

200
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,672
and we start behaving in their
manner,

201
00:19:19,697 --> 00:19:22,723
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

202
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:28,106
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

203
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:32,701
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

204
00:19:32,726 --> 00:19:36,853
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

205
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,642
they would never have accepted
them.

206
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,724
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

207
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:46,094
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

208
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,687
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

209
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:58,498
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

210
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:03,389
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

211
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:07,837
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

212
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:14,409
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

213
00:20:14,434 --> 00:20:18,063
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

214
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:23,205
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

215
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,457
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

216
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:32,371
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

217
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:36,456
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

218
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:39,932
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

219
00:20:39,957 --> 00:20:47,998
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

220
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:51,910
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

221
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:56,008
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

222
00:20:56,033 --> 00:21:02,563
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

223
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:07,992
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

224
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:15,712
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

225
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:18,915
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

226
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,519
or to worship the idols or anything,

227
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:30,974
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

228
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:36,684
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

229
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:43,920
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

230
00:21:43,945 --> 00:21:48,087
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

231
00:21:48,112 --> 00:21:51,122
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

232
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:57,908
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

233
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:03,901
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

234
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:08,302
and this and that, and give
justification.

235
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,885
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

236
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,110
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

237
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:19,563
and who are misbehaving.

238
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:25,397
You must do what a saint should do.

239
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:30,048
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

240
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:34,934
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

241
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:41,365
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

242
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,482
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

243
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:49,125
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

244
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:54,445
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

245
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,906
You can change the things
that you are eating,

246
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:04,531
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

247
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:12,141
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

248
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:17,262
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

249
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:22,155
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

250
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,520
But all the time worried about
their body.

251
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:33,196
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

252
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:41,626
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

253
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:46,563
Fashion is madness.

254
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:54,105
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

255
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,833
But in India also fashion started.

256
00:23:56,858 --> 00:24:01,301
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

257
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:07,932
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

258
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:12,210
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

259
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:14,440
You have a particular design,

260
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:18,447
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

261
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:22,144
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

262
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:27,113
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

263
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:33,462
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

264
00:24:33,487 --> 00:24:40,434
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

265
00:24:40,475 --> 00:24:45,459
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

266
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,973
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

267
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:55,065
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

268
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:00,216
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

269
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:05,510
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

270
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:12,159
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

271
00:25:12,184 --> 00:25:15,831
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

272
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:18,689
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

273
00:25:18,737 --> 00:25:24,520
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

274
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:31,150
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

275
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:34,531
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

276
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:40,149
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

277
00:25:40,174 --> 00:25:44,030
- you have to exercise and meditate.

278
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:48,603
If you meditate you become peaceful.

279
00:25:48,628 --> 00:25:54,107
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

280
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:02,515
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

281
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,928
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

282
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:10,537
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

283
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:16,390
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

284
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:23,420
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

285
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:28,722
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

286
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:36,359
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

287
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:41,113
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

288
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:45,899
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

289
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:49,467
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

290
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:52,219
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

291
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:56,646
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

292
00:26:56,671 --> 00:27:00,542
The joy of that artist is finished.

293
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:06,563
You cannot get that joy,

294
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:15,646
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

295
00:27:15,671 --> 00:27:20,882
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

296
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:26,760
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

297
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:30,032
and it makes the life so miserable.

298
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:34,755
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

299
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,568
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

300
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:45,816
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

301
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:49,692
problems of sometimes snowing.

302
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:52,968
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

303
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:56,394
and it’s very well done, we got it.

304
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:02,334
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

305
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:08,995
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

306
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,278
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

307
00:28:14,303 --> 00:28:18,864
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

308
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:25,138
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

309
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:28,839
of these Italians, so-called.

310
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:33,310
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

311
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:37,949
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

312
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:42,742
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

313
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:47,254
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

314
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,346
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

315
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,162
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

316
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:03,572
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

317
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:07,204
With a simple thing like that.

318
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:14,163
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

319
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:17,374
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

320
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:20,280
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

321
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:23,605
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

322
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,681
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

323
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:33,582
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

324
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:38,120
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

325
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:43,432
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

326
00:29:43,457 --> 00:29:49,283
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

327
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:57,004
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

328
00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:04,917
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

329
00:30:04,942 --> 00:30:10,271
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

330
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:16,580
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

331
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:23,452
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

332
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:39,688
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

333
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:47,418
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

334
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,383
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

335
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:54,987
What is the need to think?”.

336
00:30:55,738 --> 00:31:02,345
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

337
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,593
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

338
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:10,542
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

339
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:15,901
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

340
00:31:15,926 --> 00:31:21,941
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

341
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:31,420
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

342
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:34,273
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

343
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:40,920
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

344
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:44,605
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

345
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,111
What is the need to go to Mars?

346
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:53,578
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

347
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:56,297
First they came to India, then went
to China,

348
00:31:56,322 --> 00:32:02,542
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

349
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:06,689
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

350
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:11,273
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

351
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:16,321
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

352
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:20,188
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

353
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:23,597
then they’ll jump in.

354
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:28,858
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

355
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:32,927
Because monkeys won’t do that.

356
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:39,942
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

357
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:45,158
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

358
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:50,438
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

359
00:32:50,463 --> 00:32:55,420
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

360
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:57,724
They have no time!

361
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:01,989
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

362
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:07,164
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

363
00:33:07,189 --> 00:33:11,323
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

364
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:14,814
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

365
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,261
For meditation they have no time.

366
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:26,244
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

367
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:33,775
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

368
00:33:35,248 --> 00:33:40,984
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

369
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:47,800
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

370
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:54,956
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

371
00:33:55,631 --> 00:34:00,060
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

372
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:04,499
 But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

373
00:34:04,524 --> 00:34:08,793
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

374
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:11,062
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

375
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:17,045
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

376
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,213
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

377
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:24,362
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

378
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:27,376
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

379
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:31,366
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

380
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:39,422
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

381
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:45,438
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

382
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:50,053
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

383
00:34:50,078 --> 00:34:55,999
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

384
00:34:56,024 --> 00:35:01,713
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

385
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:09,530
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

386
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:18,873
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

387
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:26,555
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

388
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,064
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

389
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:35,883
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

390
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:39,999
So they also wanted to see.

391
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:48,608
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

392
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:56,535
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

393
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,156
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

394
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:05,865
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

395
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,388
Did you follow this point?

396
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:16,268
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

397
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:21,708
where you are yourself that.

398
00:36:22,156 --> 00:36:26,704
So, how can you see yourself?

399
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:30,958
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

400
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:34,883
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

401
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:41,095
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

402
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,311
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

403
00:36:46,336 --> 00:36:50,505
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

404
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:58,540
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

405
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,176
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

406
00:37:04,201 --> 00:37:11,259
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

407
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:18,055
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

408
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:26,251
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

409
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:35,409
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

410
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:42,738
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

411
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:48,593
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

412
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:55,648
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

413
00:37:55,673 --> 00:38:02,028
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

414
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:06,851
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

415
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:12,913
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

416
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:17,028
Whatever I may try on My own

417
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:21,667
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

418
00:38:21,692 --> 00:38:29,193
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

419
00:38:29,218 --> 00:38:41,598
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

420
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:45,696
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

421
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:50,610
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

422
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:57,068
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

423
00:38:57,093 --> 00:39:05,134
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

424
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:09,449
You use them.

425
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:13,452
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

426
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:19,503
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

427
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:26,441
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

428
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:30,626
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

429
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:40,145
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

430
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:47,015
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

431
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:51,717
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

432
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:59,102
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

433
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:05,068
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

434
00:40:05,093 --> 00:40:12,571
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

435
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:18,537
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

436
00:40:18,562 --> 00:40:27,410
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

437
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:35,715
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

438
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,382
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

439
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,988
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

440
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:47,357
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

441
00:40:47,382 --> 00:40:53,102
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

442
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:58,376
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

443
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:01,131
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

444
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:05,520
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

445
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:10,112
He started looking at me
like this.’”

446
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,905
So, with the Kundalini awakening

447
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:18,619
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

448
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:24,111
And then your generosity,

449
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:32,280
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

450
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:39,154
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

451
00:41:40,637 --> 00:41:48,921
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

452
00:41:48,946 --> 00:41:54,053
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

453
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,500
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

454
00:41:56,525 --> 00:42:04,244
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

455
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:08,848
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

456
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:18,684
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

457
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:22,925
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

458
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:32,847
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

459
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:39,093
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

460
00:42:39,118 --> 00:42:44,804
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

461
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:49,677
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

462
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:55,644
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

463
00:42:55,669 --> 00:43:02,225
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

464
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,792
They are just within you,

465
00:43:04,817 --> 00:43:11,362
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

466
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:16,477
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

467
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:23,641
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

468
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:28,252
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

469
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:32,119
May God bless you all.
