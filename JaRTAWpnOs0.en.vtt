00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.302
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:20.080
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

00:00:20.907 --> 00:00:26.162
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.358
So for that, what She does is to give Avaida

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:39.415
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:42.907
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:49.470
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:54.640
because everything is mythical for you.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:02.199
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.981
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

00:01:09.062 --> 00:01:14.155
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.201
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:21.703
and panicked, because they panic others

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:26.266
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

00:01:26.347 --> 00:01:29.893
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

00:01:29.974 --> 00:01:32.835
we were all frightened of them.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:38.591
Now I see that in England every English family is frightened of others.

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:43.266
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there, and shut it.

00:01:43.347 --> 00:01:47.705
They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,
they are the same English who ruled us here.

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:52.962
And we were so bewitched before them and now
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

00:01:53.043 --> 00:01:57.190
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:03.308
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks that the other person will dominate him.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.853
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:12.313
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:15.604
out of this mythical fear.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:20.886
The fear is created by our ego.

00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:26.763
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear
because he has not harmed anyone.

00:02:26.844 --> 00:02:31.158
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.537
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:40.493
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.132
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

00:02:44.213 --> 00:02:49.357
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”
That’s what it is.

00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:55.285
So when I talk of total benevolence

00:02:55.366 --> 00:03:00.538
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.931
So first is the fear,

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:05.876
which should go out of your mind completely

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.093
if you believe in the Almighty God.

00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:14.581
We’ll say: “You are Almighty God, you
are almighty this thing” It's all lip-service.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:18.528
If you believe that God is almighty, and you are connected with God,

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.235
then why should you have any fear of anything?

00:03:22.348 --> 00:03:26.736
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

00:03:26.842 --> 00:03:29.341
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:35.000
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:39.574
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:45.800
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:52.467
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:58.800
But you think you are God. You are not.

00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:02.209
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.355
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:10.928
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,
for yourself, and for everybody else.

00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:22.891
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:26.462
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:30.330
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:35.493
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

00:04:35.574 --> 00:04:39.469
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.425
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:50.717
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:54.351
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

00:04:54.432 --> 00:04:59.886
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:03.675
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:09.342
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:14.157
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything
that I am telling you.

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:16.477
Only I can tell you. Who else?

00:05:16.558 --> 00:05:18.535
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:24.418
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.
