00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.890
I am sure somebody must have spoken before,
no?

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.799
All right.

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:20.720
You all have been seeking, and seeking the
truth about yourself.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.550
Where does the truth lie?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:33.920
When are we the most truthful people?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:43.170
Where, at what point, we cannot deceive, whatever
we may try?

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.750
When it is heartfelt.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:01:06.150
When it is our heart’s desire, then we always
try to go ahead with it.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.830
But it has to be heart’s desire not the
rationality, not the brain’s desire.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.710
Because you can make your brain understand.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.070
Your intelligence can be compromised.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.750
Whatever is heartfelt you want to do it.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.399
You cannot be satisfied without doing it.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.610
So, in the heart lies the truth.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.570
That is the Spirit that lies in your heart.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.610
But that is not in our conscious mind.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.840
We do not know how it manifests.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:11.459
We have heard that it is eternal, indestructible,
is the source of joy and is the attention

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.629
of God.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.519
That’s what we have heard.

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:28.030
All such things which are preached may be
regarded as hearsays.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:39.030
People might say, “What’s the proof that
there is a Spirit in our heart?”

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:49.790
Thank God, people have discovered the heart
at least there, if not the Spirit!

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:01.180
How are we to believe that there is Spirit
– that we have a dimension which is beyond

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.489
this human dimension, which is the dimension
of the Spirit, the Spiritual dimension – by

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.720
which we can feel the All-pervading Power
of Divine love?

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.940
It’s all being told to us by all the priests
of all the religions.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.720
Now where is that Spirit?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.110
Whether it resides in the heart or where?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.200
How are we to know?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.230
How are we to believe?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.390
Or are we to deny all those people?

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.370
Did they tell us lies about it?

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.519
They may say, “You imagine, now, [that]
your awareness is that of the Spirit."

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.760
By imagination you are not there!

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.379
It’s just an imagination.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.080
Suddenly you find it was just a bubble and
whole thing has burst off.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:08.489
So today the questioning mind comes to a point,
to inquire: is there something called Spirit

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.569
that we have to identify with?

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:24.570
This inquiry itself is a seeking, because
you also do not know what is the meaning of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.470
your life?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.790
You also do not know why you were made a human
being?

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.540
What was the need for the nature to create
human beings on this Earth?

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:50.670
Why they took so much time to create it, evolve
us to this stage where we are called as human

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.820
beings?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.380
Nobody asked the question why: the scientists
do not.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:07.930
Also the people who are so called religious
do not ask the question why, they just believed

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.090
in it, “Have faith!

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.470
Have faith!

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.940
Faith is the only way you can go to God."

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.290
Blind faith!

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.920
That’s a good consolation, just a consolation
for the heart, “Oh, I have faith in this

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.850
and this."

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:39.420
But tomorrow our children will ask us, I mean,
they are already asking: “What is all this

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.560
going about?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.290
Why you are wasting your time and our time
in all this useless things?”

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:56.220
And they are going to ask: “Is there any
truth in, what you are saying?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.060
I s there God?”

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.430
So, a long time back people decided: “Forget
God!

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.560
Turn your back.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.350
That question is a mystery.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.350
Forget it.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.960
Let’s start something else."

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:20.040
So they started science, this that.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.170
Science is nothing but whatever is there you
just say, with these gross eyes human eyes

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.500
you see, now a hall like this, and a carpet
and all that you see whatever you see you

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.760
just say, “This is it, this is it."

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:41.430
The laws of science are also whatever they
see, experimented, whatever is discovered

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.430
because it exists.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.780
So whatever they have discovered it is the
science.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:55.630
But there may be something they have not been
able to discover, something beyond; and could

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:04.440
be always, because every theory they put up
is challenged, every new thought they put

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.220
in is challenged, even whatever are accepted
as Newton’s Law, and all that, are challenged

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.870
today.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.700
So everything is challenged and human beings
are just confused.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:26.350
They can’t understand, whether there is
some truth in it or not.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:36.840
In this era of confusion seekers are born,
these are the seekers of the truth.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:44.510
It’s a rare category, used to be very rare
before, not in this age of course.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.830
In this age there are many, they are really
seekers.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.040
Of course, some could be, just out of the
fashion, seekers; because, “Everybody is

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.640
a seeker all right, everybody is a hippy I
become a hippy."

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.050
“They are all going on those skates; let
me also buy some skates!”

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.160
It’s like that.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.420
But some are really seekers.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.690
They may do some guru shopping they may go
wrong.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.190
They may have a little fun here and there.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:21.180
They may try to go to places where their ego
is pampered and they may like to spend some

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:27.131
money if they have some extra money inherited
or something; like putting it on a horse (gambling)

00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.430
they may put it for their Spiritual life.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.919
Anything is possible.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:41.550
But one has to understand: why are we seeking?

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.560
Again the ‘why’.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:52.340
Of course, because we do not know the meaning
of our life.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:58.100
But maybe that we have evolved to this state
and we have to evolve to some higher state.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:10.610
Like the fishes who were in the sea were quite
happy, but one or two of them started seeking

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:17.020
something else, so they came out of the sea
and started seeking.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:24.010
And they became turtles or reptiles and the
evolution started moving further.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:35.460
We have not yet reached the epitome, or we
can say the climax, of our evolution because

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.830
we do not know our meaning.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:48.170
For example now, this instrument as it is
you see: to a lay person like me it will be

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:57.990
difficult to guess what it is for and even
to a person who knows what it is it will be

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:05.220
difficult to play it if he does not know and
a person, who also knows how to play, it will

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:11.410
be difficult to play if it is not connected
to the mains.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:22.460
So we can say there are people of four types
in this world.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:31.400
Out of them, the seekers are the one who are
just ready to be connected to the mains.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.710
They are a type.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:45.600
As soon as they are connected to the mains
they start manifesting themselves very well.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.870
Immediately they start understanding Sahaj
Yog.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.540
‘Sahaja’: ‘saha’ means ‘with’,
‘ja’ means ‘born’ – is born with

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.960
you.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:05.660
This right to be in union with God, that is
yoga, is born with you.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:16.730
.And this Sahaja, this spontaneous happening,
takes place more in a seeker than in a non-seeker.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:30.960
And the one who knows how to play this instrument
is the one who can connect.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.140
The second one is the one who wants to know
how to play it, will be the first to know

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.860
how to play it.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:47.270
But those who do not want who are not interested,
those who just come to show off, those who

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:58.340
are not seekers, they may be some big people,
may be kings and queens and may be anything,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.570
they might be priests, they might be anything
but those who do not want to know about their

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:09.250
Spirit are difficult, are extremely difficult.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.980
It’s a headache.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.150
Sometimes they feel they are going to oblige
Sahaj Yoga, by coming to Sahaj Yog.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:25.110
It’s just the other way round: Sahaj Yoga
is a very receding force – it judges you

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.990
very much.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:34.560
This evolution takes place in people who want
to know, who want to get into it.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.900
Imagine of the fishes who came out of the
water, they can’t live without water.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:52.350
To come out of water and to find their new
ways of life, new understanding of the soil,

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.450
was very difficult.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:13:01.860
Though Sahaj Yoga is not difficult at all.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:11.170
Once you get your Realisation, once the Kundalini
rises, when she pierces your fontanel bone,

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:17.270
when you get your baptism, when it passes
through various chakras and enlightens your

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:27.250
different centres, you get all the blessings
of this power within you which is resting,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:36.430
sleeping; which you can awaken and use it.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:45.170
When this power rises, She cools you down
completely.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.790
She’s so blissful.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.740
She’s compassion.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.770
She forgives.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:57.150
There are people who think, “Oh Mother,
we have committed so many sins!”

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.150
It’s nothing!

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.040
She just forgives.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.060
Forgiving is her nature.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.420
She has to forgive.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.750
She finds her own way.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.230
She enlightens all the chakras by itself.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:10.640
It’s your own mother!

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.430
Sleeping for days together, years together,
ages together, lives together.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:22.530
And She rises, She rises and She pierces this
area.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:31.040
And you become a different person all together,
like an egg becoming a bird, you become a

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040
bird.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.040
Your awareness is different.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.370
A bird has a different awareness from an egg’s
awareness.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:47.589
And that is the real second birth, is not
that you just certify yourself, “Oh, I am

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:48.600
born again!”

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.550
There are people who are going around [saying],
“We are born again!”

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.490
I said, “Who says so?”

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.650
“Yes we are!”

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.650
“But how?

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.290
What is the proof that you are born again?”

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:03.530
If you are going to live with myths, if you
are going to live with untruth, you can go

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.830
ahead.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.980
Nobody can stop you, you have freedom.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:15.990
You have freedom to do what you like; whatever
things you want to do you can do it and learn

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.770
from your mistakes, errors.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:21.980
Nobody can stop you.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.340
That’s your freedom: once granted is granted
forever.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:32.120
I mean if somebody wants to take two running
jumps and go to hell how can you stop it?

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.720
You cannot stop it.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:45.480
Its only you, when you get your Realisation,
then you know that, where is the Spirit.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.130
You know that you are the Spirit.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:56.520
You know it within yourself, not just the
rational mind tells you, “Oh I am the Spirit,”

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.300
just to believe, “I am the Spirit."

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:06.510
It’s not that, but you start manifesting
your Spirit and manifestation of the Spirit

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:12.080
gives you complete enlightenment within because
you can feel your centres on your fingers.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.820
Normally you don’t feel, you don’t know
what centres you have.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.610
Even a child can feel the centres on the fingers.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:30.810
Even the person who cannot speak, who is deaf,
can feel these centres.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:45.210
All these seven felt centres you can feel:
not only of your own but of others.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:57.060
As you grow in your knowledge [of] how to
use this new power then you can cure others

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.340
of their various problems of the chakras and
you can give them Realisation too!

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.450
You can do it.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:13.760
It’s your own Spirit that is going to work
out: is the manifestation of your own Spirit.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.750
Then you know the knowledge, you know the
truth.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:27.150
Embodying all the truths is one truth is that
you are instrument of God and the power of

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:36.929
Divine love start flowing through you and
you can know what is that power through feeling

00:17:36.929 --> 00:17:48.850
it in your conscious mind, not only that but
you can manoeuvre it, you can master it.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.270
This is what one has to expect of Self-realisation.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:18:01.430
Not a certificate, not just a book, not just
a receipt that: “I have paid so many pounds

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.809
to someone."

00:18:02.809 --> 00:18:08.940
It’s the certificate that you have to give
yourself very truthfully.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.929
Your own truthfulness is challenged in Sahaj
Yoga.

00:18:12.929 --> 00:18:15.100
You cannot lie.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:22.390
When you get your Realisation you do feel
it, and if you do not get it you just do not

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.390
get it.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.590
Nobody can force Realisation on you.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.170
One can help.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:34.710
For example now there are so many Sahaj Yogis
today here, sitting, very beautiful people.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:41.820
They are outwardly just like you, but from
their hand this power is flowing and they

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:50.740
know how to manoeuvre, how to give power to
your aura, to your Kundalini to invite her,

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.460
because they are enlightened ones and the
enlighten ones can enlighten the unenlightened

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.460
ones.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:04.850
And once the unenlightened are also enlightened
they can do the same thing to others after

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.970
learning the method how to do it.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:14.370
But before that, you are naïve; you do not
know anything about it.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:21.790
So far whatever you have known, if it was
of any value you would have been there.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:26.309
But you do not know and one should not feel
bad about it.

00:19:26.309 --> 00:19:29.900
Because we are born like that: we are to be
born again.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:36.220
There’s nothing wrong in being born as human
beings and then to be born again.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:42.380
Only human beings can be born again, not animals.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.280
So there’s nothing to feel bad about it.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:51.450
Some people get hurt when they find other
Sahaj Yogis are working on them.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:59.990
But tomorrow the same Sahaj Yogis, you will
be amazed, will be helping you very much to

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:06.310
sustain your Realisation and then you will
become a Sahaj Yogi and you will start doing

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.710
it.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:12.830
And then the whole priorities will change
because the joy of your Spirit is so great,

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:22.150
is so tremendous, that you would not like
to lose it and it flows through your fingers

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:28.530
like cool breeze and that’s the indication
that you are all right and Spirit is manifesting.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.750
But when you displease the Spirit you will
immediately know that the vibrations have

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.060
stopped.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:40.490
Any question, any fundamental question like,
“Is there God?”

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:49.700
If you ask, immediately the vibrations will
start coming with great power, showing that,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.320
“Yes, there is God."

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.720
Your computer starts working.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.900
It is so amazing, it is so amazing, because
you do not know that you are a computer.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:09.710
It would be like a television set, suddenly
brought to some villagers and you start it,

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.930
they say, “What, it looked like a box, ordinary
box and what has started?

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.010
There’s some pictures have started coming
into it?”

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:24.210
In the same way you are made that way specially,
by God Almighty – if you want I will call

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:28.010
it Nature – and now you have become that.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:33.890
So becoming is the main point in the Sahaj
Yoga and not just lecturing and talking about

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:34.890
it.

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:39.490
You may hear all my lectures there are – I
don’t know how many, hundreds – you may

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.540
do anything you like [but] nothing will go
into your head or into your heart unless and

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.730
until you have Realisation.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:52.970
It can only mean to you that, yes there is
way of doing it and all that, but unless and

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:59.880
until you have actualised it, it is useless,
everything is useless for you.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:05.470
So it is the actualisation it’s the real
happening one should ask for.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.530
And if it happens to you, you should know
that God has blessed you specially.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:19.340
There are very few people in this world – I
found when I was born – who were realised-souls.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.930
And today there are so many: they speak the
same language, they talk the same language

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:29.080
and they understand it, what it is, because
now they are exposed to the new laws of divinity.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:35.080
The Divine laws, the laws of God’s Kingdom,
they are very different from what we know.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:42.520
Unless and until you evolve into that new
state, you cannot understand God.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.880
You have to know yourself to know the God.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.960
It’s like the eyes that have to open to
see the colour.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:59.670
In the same way your Spirit has to come into
your conscious mind so that you know God in

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:07.220
your conscious mind.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.330
I would like you people to ask me some questions,
the new people who have come and old people.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.570
If there are some questions I would like to
answer.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:21.540
But you see it’s such a big subject and
every time I have to go with the introduction.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.830
I thought somebody must have given you introduction
to you, but doesn’t matter there’s book

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.179
which you can read and find out yourself.

00:23:28.179 --> 00:23:35.500
But it’s best to know, is to have it.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.300
Seeker: (inaudible)

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:48.270
Shri Mataji: What can one do?

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.549
Good idea.

00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:52.549
You got Realisation last time.

00:23:52.549 --> 00:24:04.100
The problem is, it’s a collective happening.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.910
Many people have to get Realisation and it’s
not individualistic.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:18.160
We are all part and parcel of the whole, so
if one finger is enlightened, that finger

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.280
should try to enlighten another finger.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:31.780
That is the best way, best way because once
this finger tries that it gets its power more.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:37.070
Why should God give power to anyone who just
wants to keep it to himself?

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.750
The power increases as you start giving it
to others.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:48.750
Like when you open one door no air will come
in, but if you open the other door the circulation

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.750
starts.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:55.350
In the same way when you start giving it to
others – start raising the Kundalini; right

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.130
now you can start.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:04.450
Just don’t be afraid, you can do it – you
will find immediately inside you will be coming

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:05.450
up.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:11.600
Those who try to be exclusive and try to be
something great by doing everything at home

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.800
and, “Especially for myself!”

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.450
They are nowhere.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:20.260
I find such people have horrible drawbacks.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:27.170
Mix up with the other people: share it, share
it all the time and give Realisation to others.

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.700
Those who have given Realisation to others
have come up very much.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:37.220
Those who think of others being realised,
come up much faster than the people who sit

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.730
at home and meditate for five hours.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.309
There’s no need to meditate like that.

00:25:42.309 --> 00:25:46.470
At the most just to cleanse yourself you can
spend about ten, fifteen minutes.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.910
But there are many people whose attention
is only on themselves: “I must cleanse,

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:59.429
I must cleanse I must do this,” such people
do not get very far in Sahaj Yog.

00:25:59.429 --> 00:26:05.190
Those people who try to do it for others,
talk to other people, work out much better.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.570
I would say Australians have done much better
than English have done.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.650
Maybe because of their temperaments, maybe.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.000
And they are not such closed people you see.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.090
For example they have their friends and there’s
no taboo on discussing religion with friends

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.090
as it is in England.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.210
I think in England nobody discusses religion.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.700
They’ll discuss the pubs and all nonsense
and all filth, but not the religion.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.280
They are not supposed to: in etiquettes it
is prohibited I think.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:42.760
So naturally this taboo leads you nowhere,
because you can’t talk of Sahaj Yoga to

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.250
your friends, who are there.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:54.340
If they come to your house, you can ask them
what are the new wines in the market or, something,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.059
such an ‘important’ thing they will talk
about.

00:26:57.059 --> 00:27:02.760
But you can’t talk about religion or your
experiences of Sahaj Yoga that’s the problem

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.170
– it’s regarded as bad manners.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:12.980
Now the question is that, these things are
to be shared and that’s why the Sahaj Yoga

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.700
you can only talk among Sahaj Yogis so it
[only] circulates among Sahaj Yogis.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.040
Nobody wants to hear about it.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.789
Even if you try to tell them they’ll say,”Oh
don’t tell us that we are not interested!”

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:27.090
It’s a very funny thing.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:33.560
The other day I met a gentleman who had divorced
his wife, and she got her Realisation somewhere

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.270
and he got Realisation somewhere and both
of them met in a group.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.900
She said, “How are you here?”

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.290
He said, “How are you here?”

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.150
She said, “We both got Realisation."

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.140
She said, “But you never told me about this!”

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.090
He said, “I didn’t want to discuss religion."

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.830
So she said, “I also got Realisation I didn’t
want to discuss religion."

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.780
Ultimately they discussed their divorce and
had a divorce, you see!

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.100
And if they had just told them that both of
them are realised and they would have never

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.760
divorced, because he thought this lady is
not a seeker so he divorced her, and she thought

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.760
he was not.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.100
Even if they had felt each other’s vibrations
they would have been all right to know.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.170
But she got her Realisation in another place
and he got Realisation in another place, and

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.419
they never knew that both are realised people
on the same plane.

00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:22.760
He thought she was very materialistic and
she thought that he was very materialistic.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.309
And then there was misunderstanding about
it.

00:28:25.309 --> 00:28:29.240
And they are not to discuss, one should not
say these things.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.130
Naturally everything ended up in a divorce
and now they want to marry again!

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:39.450
This is the one of the reasons why, in this
country, I think Sahaj Yoga doesn’t work

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.630
out because you are not supposed to tell anyone.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:48.950
At the most you may tell it to your children,
maybe, I don’t know, to your mother, father

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.950
sometimes.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.470
And all such people who have tried have been
able to bring their relations here.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:55.690
But it’s only relations, not in friends.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.010
With friends you are not supposed to say anything.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.590
It’s a funny thing, isn’t it?

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.030
This is the society!

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.030
What to do now?

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:15.039
I hope gradually it will change, when people
will know about these things.

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:24.240
And in Australia what they do is to have programmes
for seven days.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.710
It is very interesting I have got this from
there.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:31.710
In the ashram they have seven days programme
and out of this one day they have a public

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.710
programme.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.630
On this day every Sahaj Yogi is supposed to
bring four more.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.700
He’s not allowed to come unless and until
brings four more that day.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:46.870
And you have to bring four more you cannot
just come to Mothers programme and they can’t

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.750
listen to my tapes or anything unless and
until they bring four more.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:55.890
But it is possible in Australia because I
found the people much more open you see and

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.610
they are.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:01.620
I mean here, because of the climate may be
or we are frightened of others whatever it

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.130
is, there are certain taboos.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:08.270
Like etiquettes, I think they don’t believe
much in etiquettes perhaps.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:13.390
Like here there was an announcement that:
now you need not to do courtesy because of

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.040
tight clothes so you can just bow.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:23.150
Something like that may turn up now that you
can discuss about seeking, if not about religion,

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.370
I hope so.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.929
And this may be one of the reason people just
can’t talk about it.

00:30:28.929 --> 00:30:32.210
But still whomsoever, whom you know, you should
try to tell them that: “I have an experience.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:36.720
I met such and such person and this and that."

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.620
Immediately you will surprised your vibrations
will go up.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:51.120
It is like this, that bigger the room, the
bigger is the light provided for.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:58.270
If it is a smaller room then we don’t put
a big light, isn’t it?

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.140
In the same way if you have a wider thing.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:07.580
There’s a one gentleman in India I told
you that he gave Realisation to ten thousand

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.580
people.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:17.419
I must say that in Cambridge, Hillary and
Jim and Dawn have given Realisation to so

00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:19.690
many people, so many people.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:27.190
It’s interesting because there are Chilean
people, and the Chileans don’t believe in

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:32.460
such etiquettes so it has worked with them.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.110
Maybe one day this may work out here when
we’ll talk to others.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:44.059
So this is the only way you can really grow.

00:31:44.059 --> 00:31:46.789
Seeker: (Inaudible)

00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:58.130
Shri Mataji: Oh of course it is very important.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.742
No that’s true you have to cleanse yourself
also.

00:32:00.742 --> 00:32:03.340
There’s a way and method.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:07.670
I must circulate that, it’s a beautiful
thing they have written down these Australian:

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.909
how they cleanse themselves, how they clear
out there chakras.

00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:12.470
That is very important.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:18.220
Of course you have to clean, [but] say supposing
you clean your car every day and you don’t

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.220
move out.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.140
After sometime it will become a junk.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.370
It’s like that.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:28.340
You are cleaning yourself for what?

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.750
What is the purpose?

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:36.780
Every day we are cleaning, say the house and
everything and not even a rat comes in then

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.380
what’s the use of such a house?

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:50.920
If we clean all the lamps it should give light
otherwise what’s the use of cleaning?

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.960
It must have a purpose.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.490
You must have a purpose.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:59.400
Otherwise some people are just meditating,
meditating for what, I just don’t understand,

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.730
why are they meditating?

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:01.730
For what?

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.140
In all these gurus, they just say, “Oh you
go home and meditate."

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.140
But do what?

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.990
“Next time bring all the money to me and
again you go home and meditate."

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:15.320
Then if money is finished, “Now sell your
house bring all the money to me and meditate."

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.700
Then that is done then, “Sell your car,
sell everything, you stand on the streets

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.710
and meditate."

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.440
This is not the way!

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440
(Laughing)

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:31.280
It has become a sort of a pass time for people
instead of going to pubs, maybe it is expensive,

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280
better meditate.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.090
It’s something like that you know.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.570
It has no meaning to this meditation.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:44.010
Meditation is that you have to be in meditation
when you see that these centres are in problem,

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:50.320
you cleanse them understandingly, purify them
and then use it for a purpose of giving it

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.929
to others.

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:58.320
And once you start doing it, it works better,
your instrument works much, much better.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.789
It’s a dual way of doing things.

00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:00.789
All right?

00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:09.260
Seeker: Can the realised people recognise
other people who are realised?

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:26.819
Shri Mataji: Of course, minimum of minimum.

00:34:26.819 --> 00:34:29.210
Same Seeker: (Inaudible)

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:34.399
Shri Mataji: No I wouldn’t say that.

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:41.309
You see, Realisation is that, first it’s
a linear movement of the Kundalini, so it

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:43.980
depends on what chakras are catching.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.020
Supposing somebody has a Nabhi problem.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:51.800
So you can’t say it’s a different stage
but he has a Nabhi problem, a particular problem.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.139
Somebody has some other problem, like that.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:35:01.539
But the other stage comes in when we would
say that once the first stage is called as

00:35:01.539 --> 00:35:06.150
Nirvichar Samadhi that you achieve even before
Realisation, I mean you achieve but you do

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.499
not retain it.

00:35:07.499 --> 00:35:13.430
When the Kundalini crosses over this centre
(of Agnya) then this Nirvichar Samadhi -means

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:15.130
thoughtless awareness – settles in.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.890
But with this you can cure people but cannot
raise Kundalini.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:23.670
But when it pierces through then you can raise
the Kundalini of other people.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:29.640
But when it is settled down nicely, and when
you are absolutely without any doubts, it’s

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:36.500
a state, it’s a state of mind that comes
into you where you are absolutely doubtlessly

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.319
aware.

00:35:38.319 --> 00:35:44.619
When that happens then only we expose you
to new experiences, before that we do not.

00:35:44.619 --> 00:35:52.799
That’s a thing we have a little, we should
say, a little group of people where you have

00:35:52.799 --> 00:35:56.000
to go up to Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.349
Unless and until you go to that stage you
cannot be exposed to new experiences because

00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:05.269
you may shun it.

00:36:05.269 --> 00:36:09.200
Because the truth can be quite difficult for
you.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:16.969
So that’s the second stage we can say, where
you are exposed to those new experiences.

00:36:16.969 --> 00:36:22.410
But first stage is to become thoughtlessly
aware with the vibrations.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.170
But you can give Realisation to others, you
can give.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:30.930
But Nirvikalpa is a different thing that:
whatever may happen you know that this is

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.450
the truth, whatever may happen.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.539
That stage is to be achieved.

00:36:35.539 --> 00:36:36.890
It’s a stage.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:44.390
It’s a very high stage I would say where
you are so sensitive to things that immediately

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:50.450
you know what is negativity, from where it
is coming, how the attack is coming, how others

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:51.480
are affected.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:58.349
We have a quite a lot of them among here also
people and then you are exposed to new experiences

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:02.529
better, and then you rise in there – that’s
the Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:08.589
Then the complete Self-realisation comes in,
in a person, where he’s not bothered about

00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:19.469
catching from anyone or getting any catches
or anything and he goes on with a very confident

00:37:19.469 --> 00:37:22.200
attitude towards Sahaj Yoga.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.200
I mean he is not bothered whether, “I am
catching or something is happening.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.289
I will not see that person."

00:37:28.289 --> 00:37:29.809
That sort of stage.

00:37:29.809 --> 00:37:35.049
And we have some people on that stage who
are, I can say, self-realised fully.

00:37:35.049 --> 00:37:38.180
They can control even elements.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.059
There are people, we have got such people.

00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:43.219
Beyond that is the stage of God’s-realisation.

00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:46.309
That’s again in three stages works out.

00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:53.710
But just now let’s start from the very beginning
and it will work out I am sure now.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:38:03.009
Now I’ve been working here for seven years
and actually some of these people who are

00:38:03.009 --> 00:38:09.060
at Nirvikalpa have not been here even for
a year.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.059
So it can work very fast.

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:18.029
As the people grow in number, these stages
also grow in maturity very fast.

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:23.140
You mature much faster as the people are more.

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.019
When there were few people you should know
that I had six people I was struggling with

00:38:28.019 --> 00:38:31.680
them for four years in England.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:39.079
Even in India the first disciples who got
Realisation were with me for two years continuously

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:42.250
and then they got Realisation, the first twelve.

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.410
It’s like that.

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:54.390
Now you know, everybody, all of you, are giving
Realisation.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.319
Seeker: (Unclear)

00:38:56.319 --> 00:39:02.109
Shri Mataji: Oh dynamic, absolutely dynamic.

00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:05.880
Efficiency is too simple a word.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.390
You just become dynamic.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.849
Because a dynamic starts flowing through.

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:14.450
You don’t know how things work out.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.869
It’s amazing!

00:39:15.869 --> 00:39:20.119
It’s amazing how things work out.

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:32.269
Then all the forces which are dynamic, Divine
start their play in every way, material way

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:35.940
also, I must say.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.719
Like London Sahaj Yogis wanted to have some
houses.

00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:42.479
They said, “All right."

00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:47.420
Now they have so many houses they don’t
know what to do them!

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:55.589
(Laughter) This is the condition: they don’t
know what to do, from where to get people

00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:56.589
to house them.

00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:58.310
This is the condition.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:40:04.359
While nobody can get a house like that for
one year absolutely free or two years absolutely

00:40:04.359 --> 00:40:06.880
free, a house that is just to be painted or
something.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.880
And many houses like that.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.420
They are getting one after so many houses
[that] they don’t know what to do with that!

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:18.569
I mean, a person will have to live in three
houses if we have to divide them!

00:40:18.569 --> 00:40:19.569
(Laughter)

00:40:19.569 --> 00:40:28.329
And a lady came to me she said I am told that
houses are only given to Sahaj Yogis so I

00:40:28.329 --> 00:40:29.579
want to join Sahaj Yoga.

00:40:29.579 --> 00:40:31.150
I said, “Very good idea!

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:36.160
But first you must get your Realisation, otherwise
the Sahaj Yogis won’t have you anywhere

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.160
near.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.779
They don’t want people with bad vibrations.

00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:43.619
So you have to get your Realisation."

00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:50.369
I mean, it’s just a one of the small instances
but there are a thousand and one because it

00:40:50.369 --> 00:40:51.369
becomes dynamic.

00:40:51.369 --> 00:40:52.579
Your desire get enlightened.

00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:59.809
First of all your desires become sensible,
you have wise desires and they get enlightened:

00:40:59.809 --> 00:41:03.240
means you desire and you get it.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.089
You are amazed!

00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:06.930
Lady Seeker: (Unclear)

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:11.180
Shri Mataji: It is fantastic!

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:16.150
Can you stand up please?

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.709
I can’t hear you.

00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:20.709
You please stand up here.

00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:21.809
Australian Seeker: It’s described how the
Holy Spirit came on the Apostles in the Acts

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:32.140
of The Apostles, is that the same thing that
you are talking about?

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:38.099
Shri Mataji: I don’t think that was Holy
Ghost.

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:43.729
These apostles were also, the less said the
better!

00:41:43.729 --> 00:41:47.589
You will know about them.

00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:54.569
They were not realised, they never believed
in Christ till He got His resurrection which

00:41:54.569 --> 00:41:59.160
they saw with their eyes they never believed
in Him.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.239
You will know more about them.

00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:06.369
I don’t want to go into any controversies
but that’s not the way.

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:08.140
You see, there are many people you have seen
now.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:11.739
The other day I saw in BBC a man who is painting
like Van Gogh.

00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:16.319
And he can say that, “I have got Holy Ghost
on me!”

00:42:16.319 --> 00:42:19.539
That’s not the way, it’s a [dead] spirit.

00:42:19.539 --> 00:42:21.440
Why God should make him paint like him?

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:30.859
If God has to give you something, He has to
give you something that you cannot do.

00:42:30.859 --> 00:42:37.109
If you start speaking many languages, may
be so many dead spirits must have entered

00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:38.109
into people.

00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:40.279
There are many people who do that way.

00:42:40.279 --> 00:42:44.140
They just start talking so many languages,
there are spirits in them.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.509
What is there to speak many languages?

00:42:45.509 --> 00:42:46.569
What is so great?

00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:50.950
We have in India one gentleman who can speak
twenty-eight languages, so what?

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:55.229
He’s not a realised-soul by any chance.

00:42:55.229 --> 00:42:56.780
But how to talk [to them]?

00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:03.329
They were just ordinary fishermen and they
would not listen.

00:43:03.329 --> 00:43:06.979
You see, they were thinking they were obliging
Christ.

00:43:06.979 --> 00:43:11.859
Every day there were list of relations who
were sick, who were brought to Christ, and

00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:27.609
[it was] a big problem you know, a very tragic
thing, horrible.

00:43:27.609 --> 00:43:34.240
People are much wiser now.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:40.670
It’s very different now.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:46.299
How could you talk to these people about Kundalini,
could you?

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:50.609
This is what happened with everyone who came
on this Earth.

00:43:50.609 --> 00:43:52.579
Even Mohammad Sahib.

00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:54.670
They know how to butcher.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:44:00.109
You see, these people are not seekers and
they came to Christ.

00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:02.230
They were not seekers.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.890
If they were…I must say John was the best
among [them].

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:10.339
Even Mathew, he argued so much about the Immaculate
Conception.

00:44:10.339 --> 00:44:14.420
You see, you don’t know what was all that.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.420
Forget it!

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.789
You’ll know about them later on.

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:19.039
It is better you see now, to yourself.

00:44:19.039 --> 00:44:21.519
Now I am before you, all right, forget about
them.

00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:23.279
Let’s have it out.

00:44:23.279 --> 00:44:25.910
It’s not that same thing.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:30.050
You won’t be speaking many languages I can
assure you!

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.050
(Laughing)

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:37.259
But cold wind is the thing, that’s the thing.

00:44:37.259 --> 00:44:40.900
That’s very true.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:51.359
We had one experience of that: one gentleman
who was doing black magic, when, you say,

00:44:51.359 --> 00:44:57.069
he was ‘archbishop’ of black magic, he
came to Sahaj Yoga and he got his Realisation

00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:59.099
he got the cold wind.

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:06.309
And after that all the cups and saucers in
his house started flying around and everything

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:07.309
happening.

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:12.700
I mean it has happen very recently, about
I think fifteen, twenty days back.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:18.380
And at about twelve o’clock in the night,
people from Brighton rang me at twelve o’clock

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.589
in the night, “Mother horrible things happening!”

00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:22.070
I said, “What happened?”

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:27.209
“We gave Realisation to one man and the
whole house is in a whirlwind!

00:45:27.209 --> 00:45:31.460
Everything is moving around and we don’t
know what to do and everything cracking!”

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.089
“Oh God!”

00:45:33.089 --> 00:45:36.670
I said, “who is this gentleman whom you
gave Realisation?”

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:41.019
He said, “He is very great in black magic
this and that."

00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:45.000
I said, “Why did you give him Realisation?”

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.650
It’s a thing you know, they try to tempt,
because these spirits were around and they

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.650
wanted to tempt him.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.680
They want to frighten also.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.990
Because he has been so much with them, they
don’t want to give them up.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.990
And these things happen.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.509
But that’s not the thing that we should
expect.

00:46:04.509 --> 00:46:08.289
There was a lady whom I gave Realisation.

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:14.740
I told her that, “Because you are been indulging
into nonsensical things, your guru was a very

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:19.979
big tantrik and he used to do all such tricks,
you may start doing that after Realisation

00:46:19.979 --> 00:46:21.519
also."

00:46:21.519 --> 00:46:25.789
So she said, “No, no, no, Mother I don’t
want all that, I want param, I want the reality,

00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:26.789
I don’t want that."

00:46:26.789 --> 00:46:29.390
I said, “But still it will happen.

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.249
Somebody may try to tempt you so.

00:46:31.249 --> 00:46:34.829
Because they do not want you to be realised."

00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:37.869
And it happened to her!

00:46:37.869 --> 00:46:43.700
Rice started falling from her hand, and then
she took another turn.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.630
Ultimately she became a mad woman.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.380
So it is so.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:57.599
It can happen, but rarely, not so much if
you have not been a professional black magician

00:46:57.599 --> 00:47:05.880
or something, it will not happen.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:13.249
We have misunderstood many things and that’s
why it is necessary to know it and then understand.

00:47:13.249 --> 00:47:18.709
Because if I tell you something there would
be blockade and barrier in your mind.

00:47:18.709 --> 00:47:22.700
As it is people are brainwashed by so many
things.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.619
Like those who are Muslims don’t want to
look at Christ, they don’t want to hear.

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:29.470
Those who are Christians don’t want to hear
about anybody else.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:33.789
Those who are Hindus, they don’t want to
know about anybody else.

00:47:33.789 --> 00:47:38.119
But Sahaj Yoga gives meaning to all of them.

00:47:38.119 --> 00:47:39.209
All them, are important.

00:47:39.209 --> 00:47:43.369
All of them.

00:47:43.369 --> 00:47:49.430
Every one is important for Sahaj Yoga and
they reside within us in those different chakras.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.869
It’s a very different thing.

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:55.609
One has to first see and then judge.

00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:58.539
Not to judge about anything without seeing
it.

00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:05.479
But without seeing, whatever we judge may
not be correct.

00:48:05.479 --> 00:48:06.940
All right?

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.220
Should we have the vibrations now?

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.289
Let’s.

00:48:10.289 --> 00:48:16.720
Please put your hand like this.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.849
Just be relaxed.

00:48:17.849 --> 00:48:24.210
You have to ask for your Realisation, otherwise
it doesn’t work out, I must tell you.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:28.999
Douglas [Fry] please open these windows.

00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:33.099
There should be some cross-ventilation I think.

00:48:33.099 --> 00:48:37.959
Let it be, that’s sufficient.

00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:40.880
It’s all right.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.660
It’s like a little brahmarandhra hole blowing
some [air].

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:51.279
Put your hands like this and close your eyes

00:48:51.279 --> 00:49:00.900
Please keep the eyes closed, don’t keep
them open, because the Kundalini won’t rise

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.029
above the Agnya if you keep your eyes open.

00:49:03.029 --> 00:49:04.029
Please keep them closed.
