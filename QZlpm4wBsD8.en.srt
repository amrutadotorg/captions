1
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:30,850
Today, we are going to worship the Maha Lakshmi
which I think is very much worshipped in this

2
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:40,710
country where they worship Her as Maria and
also there’s a swayambu of Maria, you must

3
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:48,370
have seen. And also there was an apparition
of Her. First I never believed that it could

4
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:57,090
be, but then after feeling the vibrations,
now I know it was true, that She did appear

5
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:10,730
here in an apparition. She appeared before
Me, also, you must have seen, in a photograph.

6
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:22,750
This is the principle by which you have risen
to this state. The central path of your ascent

7
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,220
is created by Maha Lakshmi power for the Kundalini
to rise.

8
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,110
In the temple of Maha Lakshmi in Kholapur
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude,

9
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:45,240
Ambe.” So I asked the people there, “Why
do you sing Ambe’s song in Maha Lakshmi’s

10
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:54,960
temple?” So they said that, “We don’t
know why we do it, but is it wrong?” I said,

11
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:06,919
“No, because only in the Maha Lakshmi channel
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is the Umba.”

12
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,970
That’s how, you see, they understood and
they were really amazed that I explained it

13
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,860
very well ’cause from ancient times this
song has been sung there and they never knew

14
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:30,970
why this song is sung.
Coming to the point of Maha Lakshmi, we have

15
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:38,840
to understand what does it do, what it’s
help is that this Maha Lakshmi channel or

16
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:52,690
the Maha Lakshmi’s powers have created within
us a proper balance, a proper route for Kundalini

17
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:58,000
to rise.
Left and right has been balanced and She is

18
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:13,030
the one who creates and makes a wider path
for Kundalini to rise. This is the path of

19
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:20,720
compassion and love.
Through that compassion and love She creates

20
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:30,060
this path because She knows that if the path
is not wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

21
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:37,930
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you
start seeking and when you start seeking,

22
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:46,060
your Maha Lakshmi principle has been awakened.
That is awakened and sometimes it is very

23
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:53,120
strong. Then you start seeking in a mad way.
I am sorry to say that many are already lost

24
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:02,160
in seeking, but there are so many who have
now come to the right path and to the right

25
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,240
ascent.
Another thing this Maha Lakshmi principle

26
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:15,009
does is to allow the Kundalini’s power to
go to different chakras also. To make a way

27
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:23,209
to different chakras and corrects all the
chakras. She is a very flexible force, I should

28
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:31,079
say, which guides the Kundalini into different
chakras and She understands which chakra needs

29
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,050
the help of the Kundalini. So you must have
seen that when the Kundalini rises how She

30
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:45,800
pulsates, where She goes, where She shows
the need is of your awakening.

31
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:57,720
All this works out because She is full of
compassion and love that you should get your

32
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,980
absolute truth.
We have many problems as it is, you know,

33
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:11,860
in Sahaja Yoga because when people are ascending
they carry on with them some of their past

34
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,119
stones and they cannot climb. They try then
they fall, they try then they fall, then they

35
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:26,689
go up again, they fall. But today I’m going
to tell you about what is the state one has

36
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:37,379
to achieve. As Shri Krishna has said it in
the “Gita,” describes Sitha Pragya, the

37
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:42,059
second chapter, but it’s very difficult
to understand Him, He is not so clear cut

38
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:55,239
as your Mother is.
So people don’t understand what He is saying.

39
00:10:55,239 --> 00:11:01,179
And they ask the question, “How, how do
you reach that state of Sitha Pragya? How

40
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:09,839
do you get to that stage?” But Ganeshwara,
when he wrote his “Ganeshwari,” he called

41
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:19,749
it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of
Sahaj. He didn’t call Sitha Pragya. He called

42
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:33,489
it as Sahaja Stithi, meaning the state of
Sahaj. So he describes the Sahaj in a very

43
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:37,660
beautiful manner and very subtle. Of course,
Ganeshwara also, very few people understand,

44
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:47,019
I think.
A person who reaches that state is like a

45
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:59,759
mirror and so many faces pass over that mirror,
so many look into that mirror, so many decorate

46
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:07,850
in front of the mirror, but mirror is the
same as it is. So the person who is a Sitha

47
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:18,399
Pragya or the person who is Sahaja is not
bothered about what is facing him, who is

48
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:28,850
facing whom, where he is. He stays within
himself. He contains within himself. Like

49
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:41,360
the sun. If the sun plays with his different
rays, he is not lost. All the rays again return

50
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:54,920
to him. In the same way, all the senses that
we have, all the senses that are there do

51
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,759
play around, but for a person who is in a
Sahaja state it doesn’t matter, it makes

52
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,420
no difference. He’s not involved. He just
plays around. Again, all of them come back

53
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:15,660
to him. This is a state you all have to achieve.
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis. But I still

54
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:22,230
find people lost, getting money out of Sahaja
Yoga, some people lost getting out of leaderships,

55
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:29,079
some are lost in getting jealousies and envies
and all that.

56
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:36,369
So that means a lot of work has to be done,
still, within. There is no need to work as

57
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:43,569
such if you leave everything. That’s why
I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

58
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:51,949
what happens, that all these things that are
pulling you down are finished.

59
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:59,839
Gradually they disappear because you become
yourself. You get contained by yourself and

60
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,790
you are never bored. I am never bored. I don’t
know what boring word means, you see. When

61
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,799
it is with you or alone, I never get bored.
What is there to get bored? If you are not

62
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:17,879
involved into anything you never get bored.
Another thing is you rise above all these

63
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:24,949
things, like greed. Now people who are greedy
are still involved making money here, making

64
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:31,230
money there, all that thing. Those people
who are still full of lust are still making,

65
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:39,739
organizing, some things like that. But in
a Sahaj Stithi you just watch. You are just

66
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:47,850
a witness. You are not lost into anything
that is pulling you down.

67
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,829
This state is not difficult to achieve for
you, at all, because you have crossed over

68
00:14:53,829 --> 00:15:00,279
your mind. Now all these things come to you
through your mind. I’ve already said that

69
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:09,279
mind is a myth, which you must accept. Myth
is that this mind gives you ideas. Some people

70
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,720
think, “Yes Mother, but – yes Mother,
but – .” This “but” is coming from

71
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:24,220
your brain, from your mind. The brain is reality,
but not the mind. The mind says “but”

72
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,829
and then you start feeling very depressed
sometimes, unhappy, because some people feel

73
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:36,119
even bad because they are very good people,
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis.

74
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:45,480
Doesn’t matter. Just watch and this watching
state, this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

75
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:53,619
In that you become so subtle, you become yourself,
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb

76
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:59,859
you, nothing can change you.
Now see the nature as it is. You know there

77
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:08,290
are ninety-two elements and ninety-two elements,
none of them can be, say for example, you

78
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:20,720
cannot make silver into gold. Gold into silver.
The atoms are so arranged that they have certain

79
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:29,699
valencies and apart from atom, even molecules
are so arranged that they have their own structure.

80
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:36,519
You cannot change. If you try to change then
you will create bombs, atomic bomb, this bomb.

81
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,639
It’s absolutely destructive. It’s only
human beings who can change, who can transform.

82
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,799
Now look at the blessings that you are a human
being and you can be transformed and you can

83
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:58,970
be made into a new element that is the Self.
This is the specialty of human beings. But

84
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,280
if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

85
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:11,610
I have seen people who have been to false
gurus, they still faint, they still have problems,

86
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:18,860
they still get troubled more than people who
have been without them. They are also all

87
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:27,250
right now, most of them are improved but this
is one thing one should understand, that in

88
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:34,760
one way when you are analyzing and when you
are breaking an atom or you are breaking a

89
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,559
molecule and trying to transform, it explodes.
It doesn’t work out.

90
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:51,070
The other way round is that when you try to
synthesize, then you can form anything in

91
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:58,680
the nature. Like, this has now been brought
out by synthesizing, this plastic is created

92
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,940
by synthesizing.
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought

93
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:15,070
together and human beings have to get synthesized
also. They can be synthesized better than

94
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:24,040
matter because they change, they transform.
Now say example, there is gold. You make gold

95
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:35,940
into ornaments, make into anything. It remains
all the time, all the time gold. Gold is gold.

96
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,850
It is there. It is not that by changing them
into ornaments it changes. Its element is

97
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:49,660
there. Gold is there. But for human beings
they get transformed. When they are synthesized.

98
00:18:49,660 --> 00:19:00,160
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings. Matter,

99
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:09,790
nature, are different absolutely from human
beings. Human beings, once they are transformed,

100
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:17,770
it’s like a living process. They become
like flowers but still it is not that you

101
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:25,270
see in the nature. It’s not the same as
you see in the nature because nature doesn’t

102
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:35,670
have a mind. It doesn’t have a mind. It
just is under the control of the Divine or

103
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:45,610
nature that it’s working out that way. But
here you are under your own control. Here

104
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:54,880
you can control yourself. In this synthesis
which is growing inside you what you find,

105
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,970
that you are completely in control of yourself.
You know what is happening to you.

106
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:08,900
Now you start seeing yourself separating from
all these things. Some people come and tell

107
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:16,190
Me, “Mother, see, my ego is very bad, you
just take it out.” He sees his ego, he sees

108
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,700
what is the problem is. Somebody says, “Mother,
my nabhi is very bad, I’m still busy with

109
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:32,400
the money.” He sees it. First starts the
knowledge about yourself, we call as self-knowledge.

110
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,330
But one has to even go beyond self-knowledge.
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have

111
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:47,490
to see?
When you have the knowledge, first we say

112
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,050
there’s no knowledge, people have no knowledge,
they are ignorant, there’s darkness, all

113
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:59,190
that. Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong within you. Now

114
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:05,770
you start separating yourself from all those
things that you see as wrong with you. You

115
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:11,110
see them getting out.
So many nonsensical things there are. Like,

116
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:18,380
we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.
I mean, it’s horrible things to say on a

117
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:27,070
Diwali function, see. So the Diwali is that
one by one so many lights are enlightened

118
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:35,700
and you start seeing it first. First you start
seeing what is wrong with you and then, as

119
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:45,310
you see it, you don’t want it. Then you
work out to get rid of it, to become clean.

120
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:55,690
Now this also knowledge disappears. You don’t
have to have any knowledge. You are there.

121
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:03,100
You are there. There is no need to know about
your chakras, you are just there. At that

122
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:13,750
stage nothing matters. You become just like
a stone, I can say. Stone with a brain intact

123
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:21,900
and a heart intact and a liver intact.
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get

124
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:32,600
upset with anything. You just enjoy the love
and compassion that’s flowing. And the ripples

125
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:42,410
that come back to you, even that is lost after
some time and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

126
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,660
That is the state people achieved. In those
days they achieved this state.

127
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,040
But with that, what lacking happened, that
they’d get lost. They all got lost. They

128
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,690
couldn’t do anything to others. One person
getting it, becoming great, finished. Or two

129
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:04,730
persons at the most.
So now Sahaja Yoga stands first of all at

130
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:12,270
the knowledge state, where you have the knowledge.
First, you should first of all have full knowledge

131
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:19,030
about yourself. The self-knowledge should
be complete. Then in the third stage we should

132
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:26,080
say that when the knowledge is full you should
get rid of all those things that you know

133
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,190
about yourself, which are useless, which are
hampering your progress, which you know is

134
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,370
wrong.
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari,

135
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:41,390
I’ll just clean it out like that. Then you
start separating yourself into that Sahaja

136
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:53,710
state. But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop
another dimension which is collective consciousness.

137
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,180
That is the modern Sahaja Yoga. In the olden
days they didn’t have this, so they just

138
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:08,480
all got lost. Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness you start

139
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:18,320
feeling others, feeling for others, compassion
for others and you start working out for others.

140
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,160
In that also, sometimes, you know, when you
are working around, you think how much money

141
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:30,340
I can make, what I can achieve as a leader
or some sort of thing is still there.

142
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:37,110
But this collective consciousness starts growing.
When it starts growing then you become as

143
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:47,410
I said, drop in the ocean, means complete
ocean. You become complete ocean.

144
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:53,360
So the ocean has its own mariadas. It doesn’t
bother. It has to live with its mariadas,

145
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,570
it lives with its mariadas. It doesn’t want
to cross any boundaries, all right. Accept

146
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,800
it. It will not cross its boundaries.
In the same way it happens that you are very

147
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:13,000
self-contained. You are not selfish, but you
become very self-contained. You are contained

148
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,510
within yourself. I know many Sahaja Yogis
are angry that I have not punished many horrible

149
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:26,150
people who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.
I don’t have to bother. There’s Paramchaitanya

150
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:32,470
which is doing a lot of work. Let it look
after it. Why should I bother about anyone?

151
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:44,640
You see, after all, things are working out
so why to interfere? My job is just to watch,

152
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:53,930
just to see. That’s sufficient. There’s
no need for Me to kill anybody in this lifetime

153
00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:01,720
or to destroy. They are destroyed by themselves.
I have told you that I need not expose people,

154
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,190
but whichever country I go, I find people
get exposed.

155
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,940
I run away from there, really, sometimes,
thinking, God knows what more is going to

156
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:19,080
come. Even little attention on any country,
it just works out. Even without My knowledge,

157
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,130
“Oh My God,” I said, “When did I do
that?”

158
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:32,760
So one has to become – of course, he becomes
the power of Divine love, no doubt. He becomes

159
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,880
the power of Divine love, but he doesn’t
handle it. Left to this Divine power which

160
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:47,210
is working, which is also separated from Me,
you’ll be surprised. I am alone. Absolutely

161
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:55,730
alone. Even this power is separated from Me,
but this power knows what is good for human

162
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:01,670
beings, what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works
on it’s own. I don’t interfere. It’s

163
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:06,840
a reflex action, believe Me, it’s a reflex
action. Maybe you might say, “Mother, you

164
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:14,190
have made it.” All right, whatever it is,
but I don’t interfere with it. I don’t

165
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,500
have to tell anything to it. It just works
and it’s working so well.

166
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,290
I’ll give you an example. Once in England
long time back, they said, “Mother, we want

167
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,740
to have a very long summer.” I said, “Why
do you want to ask such things?” “No,

168
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,540
no, Mother, we must have a long summer, a
very long summer, very – ” Three or four

169
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:40,430
times they said it and it was a very long,
horrible summer in London. And it’s not

170
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,250
like India where we have air conditioning,
fans, something we have, at least hand fans.

171
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:50,180
There was nothing there. So we didn’t know.
We had a little gallery, we used to sleep

172
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:59,510
in that. So we went to the shop in England
and we asked in London City, for a fan. So

173
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,550
they said, “All right, after three months.
You order us.” After three months when it

174
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,610
will be very cold they will give us the fan.
We said, “We don’t want any fans.” So

175
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,330
My daughter sent two fans by plane. And that’s
how we managed. You see, Indians, we feel

176
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,830
very hot because we have had a lot of sun
in our country, we feel much hotter than any

177
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,270
one of you. The way you sit in the sun, you
know, we can’t understand. You know, in

178
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:34,030
India they used to say an Englishman and a
mad dog can only go in the sun. So our situation

179
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,530
is like that, that we cannot go in the sun
because we have had too much.

180
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:45,320
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous,
so tremendous that after that one thing good

181
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:52,610
happened. That ochre color appeared on the
leaves and then gradually the red and all

182
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:59,330
that of the autumn season was best at that
time and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that,

183
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:07,100
“Mother asked me to drive in Her back yard.”
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been

184
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,400
asking me to drive in the back yard.” So
I telephoned to him, I didn’t know he had

185
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,480
dreamt like that, that, “Can you come along
for a while, I want to go and see this autumn

186
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:24,160
all over England.” So he came and we were
driving, miles together and then they told

187
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,450
Me, “Mother, it was so, he told us that
that was My back yard.” Can you imagine

188
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,690
that he was driving for miles together, beautiful,
just like Canada, the whole England was filled

189
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,320
with the beauty of autumn.
So even if there’s something like that happens,

190
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,090
it is compensated. It is compensated and so
beautiful it was, all the people were out

191
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:55,600
in the autumn to see the beautiful colors
of the nature, of different greenery, yellow,

192
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:03,590
ochre, all kinds of colors were there. Surprisingly,
in that country you never see all that. And

193
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:12,940
because of the sun shining so bright, it was
compensated. It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.

194
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:21,610
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.
All these things are managed by Paramchaitanya.

195
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:28,350
I am doing nothing. I am Nishkriya. I’m
just sitting down and watching. To Me nothing

196
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:33,780
matters. You see, it’s working out slowly
and steadily. Ha, if you tell Me something

197
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,230
supposing, they said, “Mother, we prayed
to You and it happened.” All right, maybe,

198
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:45,300
these people must have heard, around Me, Not
me, you see, and they must have done the job

199
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,930
and for that I’m not responsible, in no
way.

200
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:56,370
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was very
sick and was about to die. She wrote a letter

201
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:01,100
to Me, three letters she wrote that, “My
son is going to die, he’s a young fellow,

202
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,800
studying in Harvard.” I didn’t do anything.
I never wrote to her. Fourth letter came that

203
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,870
he’s completely cured. Now I didn’t do
that because I was just sitting in one place

204
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:18,900
and how is it, it has worked out.
So everything, you see, you think I do is

205
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:25,130
not done by Me. Is done by this Paramchaitanya.
Because I’m also separated from you, completely,

206
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,559
absolutely separated. So they say, “You
pray, now.” You can pray. If you pray, you

207
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:36,000
pray to these deities that are around, you
pray to all these ganas and all that, not

208
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,690
to Me. Because I have nothing to do with it.
You see, they don’t tell Me that I have

209
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,830
to do this or I have to do that, so why should
I tell them do this or do that? It is like

210
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,559
that.
And in that state only we can say you are

211
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,330
in a Sahaja state, where you don’t desire
anything, you don’t want anything. I do

212
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,679
everything. All kinds of things, I am doing.
Like the sun is doing, I am also doing in

213
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:10,250
the sense that I’m looking after things,
flowers, this that. I am also receiving presents

214
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:18,050
from you, I’m receiving this from you and
then see, I don’t receive anything. I don’t

215
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:24,090
have anything. I have no interest in it. But
you want to give for your joy, all right,

216
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,550
have it. You want to put flowers, all right,
you can have flowers. Even if there’s flowers

217
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:36,550
or not makes no difference to Me as a person,
I’m saying. But as Your Mother I love you.

218
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:42,410
All of you I love. But I don’t do anything
as such to love you. And everybody says, “Mother,

219
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,140
You love us so much.” When? When did I love
you. I never even kissed you. But you always

220
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:54,040
say I love you very much. So what is this.
Who is working it out, this? Is something

221
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:01,770
which is not Me, beyond Me. This is the state
in which, once we rise, we call it as Sahaja

222
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:07,740
Stithi. In the Sahaja Stithi you think you
are doing nothing. Everything is working out.

223
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,230
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,
“Oh, we are not doing anything. Why should

224
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:20,250
we spread Sahaja Yoga, it’s not our job?”
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s

225
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,200
why.
So you have to rise up to that state. That’s

226
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,360
only possible when you are in the knowledge
state, where you have self-knowledge, the

227
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,260
knowledge of the whole world. But if you go
beyond knowledge then you must have seen many

228
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:44,290
a times, I just say something. I just say
something and it is there. I never feel vibrations

229
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:50,570
of anyone or anything. I don’t feel My Kundalini,
either nor any chakras, nothing, but I know,

230
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:56,220
know automatically like a computer. But that
computer also I am not. Just it’s trouble,

231
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,070
it’s difficult to explain to you what is
this stithi is because you have to achieve

232
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:08,480
it. Once you achieve it then you are in a
very subtle state and that subtle state is

233
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:18,230
nothing but bliss. But that bliss also you
cannot enjoy. I don’t know how to enjoy

234
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:25,520
everything. Supposing now you say, “Jai
Mataji.” I forget even you are calling Me.

235
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:34,230
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

236
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:41,159
that the state in which one has to rise is
a state where without doing anything, everything

237
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,139
works out. If that is your state, all right.
But it’s not so. So you have to rise up

238
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:54,079
to that state by doing. First you have to
do it. First you have to know and then knowledge

239
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,609
has no need, you don’t have to know, but
first that has to be worked out and brought

240
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:05,630
to that level.
Now Diwali has the significance that on Diwali

241
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:16,109
day, what we do, we put lights all over. So
that we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere. But does

242
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:28,589
the light know about itself? Does the candle
knows about itself? She enlightens everything

243
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:41,420
but she doesn’t know. Like the moon, which
is giving moonlight, does it know itself?

244
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:52,140
Does he enjoy? Nothing. In the same way it
happens that on a Diwali day you are, what

245
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,019
you are doing is enlightening people, you
are enlightening them, you are doing all this

246
00:35:57,019 --> 00:36:02,999
for them, it’s a good idea. You must do
it. But also know that you have to become

247
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:12,400
the lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.
So there are two messages. The first one is

248
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,549
that we have to enlighten the world, we have
to enlighten others. This is the first one.

249
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:26,539
Then we have to become that which is the light
itself and light itself doesn’t know. Yesterday

250
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:29,950
you were singing, “You are the light,”
you are this thing. All right, so what? I

251
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:37,700
was just saying, ‘Yes, I am the light, I
don’t know Myself.” That’s the state

252
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,869
where you don’t know you are the light.
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come

253
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:47,440
into your head. Even so many times you have
sung, you have said thousand names there are,

254
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,410
everything, but it doesn’t come into My
head that this is Me you are talking about.

255
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:00,170
Now when I say this I don’t know how you
will react. Because human beings are queer

256
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:06,829
birds, you see. You tell them something. Maybe
that your ego might come up and you say, “Yes,

257
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:12,400
yes, I am also just the same.” There are
many, many who came like that, that, “I

258
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,970
am higher than Mataji.” Ba, ba maybe, I
don’t know. There are many who said that,

259
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:23,309
“I am Kalki.” Nowadays there’s one fellow
going round saying, “I am Kalki, I am this,

260
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:41,569
I am that.” All right doesn’t matter.
You be that, very good idea.

261
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:50,890
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means I
don’t know what I am, really. I had to say

262
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,890
because people said, “Mother, you have to
declare.” Declare what? Whatever I am, that

263
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:00,579
I am.
Now I find by declaration you people started

264
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:09,499
growing more, so all right, have it that way.
But there is no need for anyone to declare

265
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:14,650
anything or to say anything. That is the state
one has to achieve.

266
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:22,059
But to get to that state you have to work.
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You have

267
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:29,450
to enlighten many lights. That means you will
realize that you are the light which is enlightening

268
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:37,339
all that, and then in a subtle way you will
realize that, “I am the light.” Many Sahaja

269
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:43,499
Yogis are doing a lot of work and working
it out, spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a very

270
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:50,059
great thing that has happened. In so many
countries, the way it has spread, it has removed

271
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:57,849
the darkness of religion which was outside.
It was darkness of so many – racialism,

272
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:06,859
thisism, thatism, all it has removed. So this
has worked out, the cleansing. For you to

273
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:16,640
have the clean water to swim.
Once you start doing that then you realize

274
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:25,269
gradually that now the sea is clean, we just
watch, we just see how it is working. I hope

275
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:35,390
in your lifetime only, you achieve this state
where you achieve your complete work of self-realization

276
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,200
to others.
Those who do not give self-realization to

277
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,099
others, who just come for the pujas, this
thing, are mediocres. They cannot rise very

278
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:50,450
high. This coming to puja is what, like, you
just rise higher with the puja then again

279
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,259
you go down.
But those who steadily grow will grow into

280
00:39:54,259 --> 00:40:00,980
this state, I am sure, in My lifetime I should
be able to see such people who are such that

281
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,029
if they stand here they emit peace, they emit
light, they emit everything. Because they

282
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:12,369
are the light. They don’t have to enlighten,
but they are the light. Such a stage has to

283
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:19,749
be developed and to be worked out within yourself.
And this state has been described by so many

284
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:25,710
poets, so many saints and everything, but
they were at that stage and people thought,

285
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,269
what is this they are talking? They thought
they were mad. Even for Christ, they thought

286
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:32,789
He is to be crucified, because they couldn’t
understand it.

287
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:39,890
Now you are gradually growing one by one,
step by step, so now you understand this.

288
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:45,559
You understand Christ, you understand all
these people and at this stage you have still

289
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:51,569
to work. Those who do not work for Sahaja
Yoga cannot rise higher. You have to work

290
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:59,509
for Sahaja Yoga, you have to spread it more,
you have to work it out, enjoy each other,

291
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:08,569
this brotherhood, everything. All the qualities
of a beautiful personality should be there.

292
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:16,089
Unless and until you achieve that state, then
you can only rise higher to that stage which

293
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:21,289
I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi. In that
state you will be perfect.

294
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:28,619
But you must get rid of all these things and
today is a day, also of Maha Lakshmi. The

295
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:35,989
first thing is, I think, this madness about
money. This should be understood that it’s

296
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:41,269
real madness. Those who are rich have no money.
You ask a rich man, he’ll say, “Oh, I

297
00:41:41,269 --> 00:41:44,839
have no money.” Why? What is all this? “This
is no money”.

298
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:53,989
You ask the poor man, he has no money. A rich
man has no money. So it’s a kind of a greed

299
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:59,579
which is never satisfied, which never helps
you. All these little, little things have

300
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,369
to first drop out. Then your work should cleanse
you. In your work you will know whether you

301
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,849
are cleansing or not.
In the work you will know how you are doing

302
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:16,599
your work. Once that is done, then I think
I am sure some of you will achieve that state

303
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:22,130
in My lifetime, in your lifetime.
That’s what I want today to tell you, on

304
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:27,789
a Diwali day, that we have to become subtler
and subtler and subtler.

305
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:36,809
We should not be influenced by outside things.
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort

306
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:46,509
of a fashion starts. People who follow fashions
are stupid. They are like blind mices. Anybody

307
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:50,900
can lead them into anything, now do this,
they do it. That, they do it.

308
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:59,160
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought
which is given to us by somebody else, in

309
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,279
that thought you’ll completely lose yourself
and you’ll become, “I am this, I am Christian,

310
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:16,549
I am Hindu, I am Muslim, I am Muss leman.”
Stupidity. You are yourself. You are the Spirit.

311
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:24,029
And when you become the Spirit then you start
knowing so much and that knowledge is very

312
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:29,259
important.
This is the gap between a saint and a normal

313
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:35,239
human being, which you have crossed gradually
so you know what are the problems of the human

314
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:40,979
beings are and dealing with human beings,
you know how to deal with them.

315
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:47,150
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective consciousness,
in modern times, has come. This collective

316
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,339
consciousness, also the saints had, but they
would not say. They would not say anything.

317
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:58,729
They would not bother.
All right, this fellow has this chakra, let

318
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:05,130
him go to hell. Doesn’t care. It’s not
a question of not caring, but not bothered.

319
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:11,819
They were sitting in a state which was just
recording, all right. An ugly man goes before

320
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:18,119
the mirror, all right, if a beautiful person
goes before the mirror is all right.

321
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:26,529
In the same way these people start allowing
people to pass through but we have to understand,

322
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:33,569
still we have to grow. We have to still grow
by working it out. Those people who are working

323
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:45,799
it out and spreading it all over are the ones
which are really very much there and to them,

324
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:52,779
I must say, the Paramchaitanya is just their
servant.

325
00:44:52,779 --> 00:45:01,009
I have seen people who desire something, it
works out. They ask for something, it works

326
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:07,150
out. For that, now, what should we have, is
the point.

327
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:13,499
After getting realization, after getting everything,
what should we have that we develop is the

328
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:26,829
faith. Faith in yourself. Faith in that you
are the Spirit, that you have the light and

329
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:37,489
you have to enlighten others. This faith when
it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

330
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:46,269
oh, what I am. I am the Spirit. If you are
the Spirit then this whole nature is with

331
00:45:46,269 --> 00:45:56,479
you. I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them
was a fisherman. He was doing Sahaja Yoga

332
00:45:56,479 --> 00:46:04,979
work. He has tremendous faith in Me and somehow
he was going to another village to do Sahaja

333
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:11,019
Yoga work. When he came out of his little
hut he found it’s all full of clouds, black

334
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:18,369
clouds. So he raised his hand and said, “See
now, I’m going for Mother’s work. And

335
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:24,390
you dare not start raining. You keep as you
are, hanging there till I finish my work,”

336
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,739
you see. Because he was going by boat. And
other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he

337
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:34,979
talking about?” They all got into the boat,
they reached the other village. They gave

338
00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:40,150
realization to others, he finished his lecturing,
everything, he came back on the shore and

339
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:45,440
he entered his house. When he was closing
the door, “All right, so go ahead,” he

340
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,650
said. And he managed.
So the complete faith that this Paramchaitanya

341
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:58,609
is like your servant, is all the time waiting
there to serve you. Whatever you say will

342
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:05,549
happen. But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

343
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:13,210
Even now I find, you see, people have some
lust, some sort of a horrible things in them.

344
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:19,319
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

345
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,960
If you are in the righteousness, there’s
no question. There’s no question that this

346
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:30,589
Paramchaitanya won’t obey you. But supposing
you want today something and it doesn’t

347
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:38,109
work out, then even to get disappointed itself
is not a very good thing. Disappointment also

348
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:52,479
is a sign of your immaturity. What is there
to be disappointed? Maybe that that was good

349
00:47:52,479 --> 00:47:56,930
for you.
Supposing I lose My way. I’m going this

350
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:03,519
way and I lose My way, I don’t know where
to go. So I get lost, it’s all right. What

351
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,710
is there? Wherever I am, I am there. How can
I be lost to Myself. And then what I find,

352
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:14,039
that I had to go that way because I was to
meet somebody, I’ve been wanting to meet

353
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:21,799
somebody and meet that person there. Can you
imagine? Such things happen with Me, and even

354
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:27,160
if I don’t meet, so what? I was to go that
side. I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.

355
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:33,049
It’s like that.
So once you know that whatever you are doing

356
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:41,910
in command, full command, full faith, actually
the whole authority comes to you through your

357
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:47,450
faith which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning
the truth.

358
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,859
The truth gives you the authority. If you
have the truth with you, you have the absolute

359
00:48:52,859 --> 00:49:00,049
truth with you then you have the authority
and the authority is such that that authorizes

360
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:07,890
you, not others, but to you. This authority
that you have works and works. I’ve seen

361
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:15,009
with simple Sahaja Yogis, very simple uneducated
also, are very powerful Sahaja Yogis, are

362
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:21,890
very powerful Sahaja Yogis. But they have
one thing, is faith, complete faith.

363
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:31,249
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha,
means patience, suboori – patience. You

364
00:49:31,249 --> 00:49:35,979
must have patience. If you don’t have patience,
you want immediately something to be done.

365
00:49:35,979 --> 00:49:44,549
How will you see the whole thing working out?
Many people are extremely jittery and very

366
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:51,940
fast-running. This world is running so fast
and you are the ones who have stood out and

367
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:59,089
watching this rat race. You are not one of
them. So must have titiksha, means you must

368
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:07,619
have patience. So you must have faith in yourself
fully and also patience, how Sahaja Yoga is

369
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,609
working out or how this Paramchaitanya is
working out.

370
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:17,160
If it works this way, all right, that way,
all right. It is some meaning. If it works

371
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,739
this way, there’s some meaning. If it is
that way it has some meaning.

372
00:50:22,739 --> 00:50:34,039
Now another thing which is important is the
faith in your guru. If you have faith in your

373
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:41,880
guru, Paramchaitanya is kind to you. It’s
very helpful. But if you doubt, then Paramchaitanya

374
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:49,339
also doubts you because Paramchaitanya knows
you through your guru, whether it is Me or

375
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:56,369
any other real guru, it’s the same. But
with Me, of course, because, you know, I’m

376
00:50:56,369 --> 00:51:02,999
very forgiving so people start taking liberties.
With another guru, you see, he will beat them.

377
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:09,299
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things to
you if you are not there. So I’ve told you

378
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,670
many stories about the gurus, how they treat
– good gurus – their disciples.

379
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:19,049
But I forgive. I don’t say anything. Let
it be, it doesn’t matter. Because I think

380
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:25,329
by leaving them alone only, they will rise
and they will come up to this stage. But it

381
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:33,759
happens sometimes that it may work the other
way round, that if they are forgiven, then

382
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:50,969
they take it for granted. So the faith in
yourself is with patience you watch and do

383
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:57,660
not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.
Now, just imagine so many people have got

384
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,319
realization, so many saints in this world,
have you seen? Yesterday I was surprised the

385
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:08,859
way the French were singing so well. You know,
first time I had to take a harmonium to teach

386
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:18,369
them how to sing one line. Half an hour I
tried, I couldn’t do. The same French have

387
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:25,190
reached that state of creativity.
You see, all your potential will rise. It

388
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:33,029
will express itself, but be careful not to
get into ego about it. Gradually it will flower

389
00:52:33,029 --> 00:52:38,619
and others who are surrounding you will get
the fragrance of it and they’ll come to

390
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:44,400
Sahaja Yoga. That is the blessing at that
time, the blessing of the real Divine will

391
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:52,190
be that you’ll be raised to the state which
we call as a perfect, ‘purnattwa’, complete.

392
00:52:52,190 --> 00:53:00,650
That completeness will come. But you judge
yourself. Are you absolutely one with Sahaj?

393
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:06,640
Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?
Or other things are more important to you

394
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:18,009
than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.
There is something to be understood very clearly

395
00:53:18,009 --> 00:53:23,589
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga.
Cannot be. There’s no competition. There’s

396
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:32,809
no envy, there is no back biting, nothing.
It is, you are different people. You are saints.

397
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:40,839
Your style is different. You are absolutely
above all these things. You cannot be dishonest,

398
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:46,099
you cannot cheat people, you cannot do this.
And if you are doing that, even now, then

399
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:54,259
please try to understand that you have still
to grow into it. Some big people think they

400
00:53:54,259 --> 00:54:04,079
are very high up in Sahaja Yoga. It’s not
so, it’s not so. If by thinking what you

401
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:13,900
are, then you are lost. What you have to do
is to understand “What have I done? How

402
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,109
many people have I given realization, to how
many people have talked about it?” People

403
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:23,789
are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.
I have seen one lady was traveling with Me.

404
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:27,900
Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba who is she, this
one? I don’t know.” So she told Me the

405
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,599
name of her guru. She said, “My guru is
like this, guru like that, like that.” I

406
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:36,989
said, “My God, this heat coming out of this
woman and she’s talking so much.” But

407
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:42,569
a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is
Sahaja Yoga. They feel shy. They’ll have

408
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:46,960
a hundred friends, they’ll meet a hundred
friends but they will never tell them what

409
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,999
Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties,

410
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:56,680
you see, if the others are drinking they’ll
say, “All right, I don’t drink.” But

411
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,509
they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.”

412
00:55:01,509 --> 00:55:06,700
They will not say that.
So this is the third point, one has to know

413
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:14,779
the announcement. You must have faith in yourself
and you must announce. All the saints announced.

414
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:20,849
They were killed for that, you saw how Socrates
was given poison. Doesn’t matter. Nobody’s

415
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:26,410
going to kill you now, in these modern times,
there’s fundamental rights to exist. So

416
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,839
nobody can kill you, take it from Me, but
you must announce. And the announcement should

417
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:38,829
be with full faith and understanding about
Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

418
00:55:38,829 --> 00:55:49,950
The purpose is to transform the whole world.
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

419
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,229
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated because

420
00:55:55,229 --> 00:56:00,029
how it works.
The other day, you remember, the mike had

421
00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:08,249
failed completely and I was giving the lecture
and still I was talking. The mike had failed

422
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:14,799
but everybody was listening to Me. What had
happened? Did I enter into the ether? What

423
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,769
happened? I don’t know. I didn’t even
know that mike had failed. I was thinking

424
00:56:19,769 --> 00:56:26,420
there is mike, that the way people were listening
to Me, but then they told that half lecture

425
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:33,450
was without the mike. And everybody was absolutely
listening to Me.

426
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:47,299
You see, it is something that one has to wonder
and appreciate what things are happening now,

427
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:54,650
where are we going. We are going into the
Kingdom of God and all the blessings, all

428
00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:01,739
the bliss will be on you.
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything becomes

429
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:09,549
one, nothing but bliss and you are in that
state of bliss which you don’t even know,

430
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:17,289
you are just there. The greatest bliss is
that you don’t know even anything, you’re

431
00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:21,029
just there.
I hope all of you achieve that state with

432
00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:27,180
this Diwali being done in Portugal, which
is a special place, I think, of Maha Lakshmi

433
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:32,989
because She appeared here as they say and
also this swayambu that we have, also is that

434
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:37,180
of Maha Lakshmi face, so I’m sure it will
work out for all of you.

435
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:45,369
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you, that

436
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:52,670
one has to rise up to that state and that
state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

437
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:57,769
It slowly, gradually it – then you don’t
have to do anything, you go into a village

438
00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:02,259
and everything would be there.
See, now, what happened. I went to Cairo.

439
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:07,749
Everybody was saluting Me. I was wondering,
what has happened to them? I went to Leningrad,

440
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:12,269
thousands came to My program. I asked them,
“How did you come to My program?” They

441
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:17,079
said, “It’s obvious from Your face, it’s
obvious.” They just saw a small, little

442
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:21,979
advertisement in the newspaper, “It’s
obvious that You are Divine.” That should

443
00:58:21,979 --> 00:58:28,989
happen. And then you can announce that Sahaja
Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

444
00:58:28,989 --> 00:58:34,640
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to
say something to their friends and things.

445
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,700
And you must know that all of those who you
love, who you know, will go to hell or where

446
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,999
– they’ll hang in the limbo or what? If
you have achieved it you should pull them

447
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:50,660
out also. They may not. They may not be seekers,
doesn’t matter now. I think we are finished

448
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:55,950
with the seekers now, must be – we must
have people who are not so seeking, it looks

449
00:58:55,950 --> 00:59:01,600
like that.
So may God bless you all.
