00:00:01.015 --> 00:00:05.320
I will be giving you the information about
Kundalini.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.190
At the same time,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.780
the Kundalini would be rising.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.840
You won't feel the rising of the
Kundalini.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.700
So please put your hands like this.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.320
The hands are asking for realization.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.620
So in the hand, there should be a feeling.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.038
I mean, you must ask.

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:35.536
The hand should be put in such a manner
as if you are asking.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.760
So straight like this, not like that,
and on your laps.

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:41.099
SAYS SOMETHING IN MARATHI.

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:49.366
If you don't know,

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:52.842
SAYS SOMETHING IN MARATHI.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:01:01.340
If you don't understand, so
i speak in hindi. understand.

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:18.488
Man should think this, that God

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:22.822
Why make us?

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:29.898
Is there any goal in our life or has God

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.762
taken us from amoeba and made us humans?

00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:39.327
After facing so many
problems, for so many ages,

00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:42.577
after passing through
so many births, God has

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:49.611
created this beautiful
creation of man. has made,

00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:53.061
It must have been made
for some reason or the other.

00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:59.843
It is possible that he has not yet
reached that stage where he can

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:06.921
understand why he created this work?

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.518
It is possible that
he may not have

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:18.022
understood the reason
behind his action yet.

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:23.815
But surely, there must be
some reason it should be

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:27.022
asked, why did a human
being become from an amoeba?

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:38.432
If there is a reason, find it It is also
absolutely necessary for humans.

00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:45.065
When he can't find it, when he
can't know it, then his worrying is

00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.599
also absolutely natural.

00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:54.108
It is natural that today man

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:59.531
very worried, upset and is nervous.

00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:03.458
He doesn't know that this nervousness
is coming where from;

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:10.631
What for he is so busy and
impatiently roaming around.

00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:19.554
Sahaja Yoga is
the answer to this.

00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:26.287
Sahaj, 'Sah' means -
along with, 'J' means - born.

00:03:26.687 --> 00:03:31.462
Who is born with
you, right to 'Yog'

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:35.987
Of being one with God,

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:41.720
that is called Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:51.087
- Sahaja Yoga, when
man was a dependent, even

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:54.187
when he was an amoeba,
there was Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:59.187
And when he became quadrupedal,
Sahaja Yoga also happened.

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:02.687
And since he became bipedal,
even then Sahaja Yoga was formed.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.920
And since he became a human being,
even then Sahaja Yoga is there.

00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:11.986
And today's Sahaja Yoga is here
to convey its meaning to man,

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:17.186
its last extreme, its final goal.

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:37.786
While searching about
it, in our time in India,

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.071
in ancient times, many
sages, through meditation

00:04:42.095 --> 00:04:45.553
discovered many
things within.

00:04:46.426 --> 00:04:50.679
During the time of Parushram,
when Parushram was born,

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.132
people tried to search in the forests.

00:04:56.418 --> 00:05:03.754
Going aloof from rest of the
world, by living in strict celibacy;

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:11.854
Hiding in a small cave, he
performed penance. for many years.

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:21.559
And after that they discovered the

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:29.147
subtle, hidden secrets within man.

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:40.251
Whatever their investigation was going on
only very few people, extremely few people

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:55.575
could take advantage because
this work was very subtle.

00:05:57.163 --> 00:06:00.992
And to do this work
while living in society was

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.246
extremely difficult.

00:06:04.352 --> 00:06:07.746
Even if these people
have written about it's grace

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.163
in their scriptures or in
their books,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.410
In many ways

00:06:15.996 --> 00:06:20.662
all these subtle elements have
been described.

00:06:21.412 --> 00:06:25.012
But Kaliyuga, which we
today call modern times,

00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:33.942
the time has come today, it is now,
which we call the spring time.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:40.066
As initially just only one or so flower
blooms on a tree,

00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:42.146
only one or so bear fruit;

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:45.053
It continues like
this for many years,

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:50.542
When spring comes,
many flowers bloom.

00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:53.853
With many flowers blooming

00:07:00.424 --> 00:07:03.317
they turn in fruits
all at once,

00:07:03.503 --> 00:07:07.976
in natural way, effortlessly, they
turn in fruits. How are they made?

00:07:08.243 --> 00:07:11.018
No one knows why they get made.

00:07:11.043 --> 00:07:16.152
Till today these are flowers,
tomorrow fruits come out of them.

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:23.085
Similarly, today spring
has come in Kaliyuga,

00:07:26.619 --> 00:07:34.396
And your right to know what you
are, what you mean, why you are this

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:38.786
Why have you
come into this world, you must know it.

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:43.879
This is your own

00:07:43.946 --> 00:07:46.021
asset.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:55.906
Just as a lamp is fully
cared, inside it

00:07:57.106 --> 00:08:01.212
oil, wick, everything
is put in place properly,

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:05.145
and on the day of Diwali all
these are installed in one line;

00:08:06.438 --> 00:08:10.454
then by taking a lit lamp,
you can light so many lamps.

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:14.146
Similarly Sahaja Yoga is an

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:20.287
extremely simple
and easy method.

00:08:22.521 --> 00:08:29.021
And man should not care so
much about why it is so simple,

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:35.339
In matters of religion, man
always thinks the opposite.

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:41.756
Earlier, if you had to go Kashi from
here, people had to walk for 3-4 months.

00:08:42.286 --> 00:08:44.850
If you want to go to
Kashi today,

00:08:44.874 --> 00:08:48.036
then if in the morning here, you
can reach Kashi in the evening.

00:08:51.635 --> 00:08:57.552
Then why doesn't man think that for that we
hear that big things have to be collected,

00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:01.552
We have to stand up and do a lot of
penance, only then we reach somewhere.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.493
If in the case of Sahaja Yoga also, if any
such special arrangement has been made,

00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:12.643
So why should there be so
much discussion and fuss about it?

00:09:14.276 --> 00:09:20.327
If you are going to get something special,
and you are going to get its benefits,

00:09:20.876 --> 00:09:24.077
So why should there be
so much doubt about it?

00:09:26.085 --> 00:09:30.259
And after all, the doubt should also
be there, where you are to pay for.

00:09:31.892 --> 00:09:34.288
Or there is a demand
for something,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.403
Or someone says, brother
look, here you will have to

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.120
do a three-year course,

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.487
and you will have to come daily
and you will have to pay this much fee,

00:09:43.587 --> 00:09:45.865
And you will have to
go hungry, or should

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:48.453
we say, you will have
to stand by your head.

00:09:48.507 --> 00:09:50.137
We don't say all this.

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:59.833
Then why think with so much doubt that how
can this happen, it can definitely happen,

00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:05.121
Now in this situation
at least fifty percent

00:10:05.145 --> 00:10:07.374
people say that this has
happened to them, and

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:11.324
it should happen with you too,

00:10:15.087 --> 00:10:19.370
But human thoughts
are just opposite.

00:10:21.869 --> 00:10:25.918
Now the issue is, is there
really any such system within us?

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:33.219
Is there such a sprout within us, like
every seed has, as a result of which,

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:36.852
you attain your rebirth.

00:10:41.034 --> 00:10:47.034
Gyaneshwar ji, Janak, Nanak,

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:51.751
Kabirdas ji, Yoga
Vashishtha, Markande ji,

00:10:53.401 --> 00:10:57.579
And the greatest of all
Adi Shankarachary ji has

00:10:57.603 --> 00:11:02.217
spoken many times about
Kundalini;

00:11:03.782 --> 00:11:06.088
Devi Mahatmay, you read it,

00:11:06.141 --> 00:11:11.450
or you may read the Devi Sahstra Nam,
then in all its descriptions its written

00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:15.575
that is, where is it located, on
which chakras is it located,

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:19.692
Which Marg does that uplifting
take place, all is explained. there

00:11:20.645 --> 00:11:21.924
But for us,

00:11:21.964 --> 00:11:25.675
which are called in English as Greek and
Latin, because we have become so English

00:11:25.844 --> 00:11:28.010
that we do not
know anything about our own stuff.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.197
Now if mantras are being
chanted in the house, then

00:11:30.223 --> 00:11:32.170
we are listening, some
Pundit Baba comes at home,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.006
gave him 10-15 rupees,
and its done, he chanted mantras,

00:11:35.073 --> 00:11:40.189
All our worship, 'Path' , all our ritual
is done, we have pleased the goddess.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.054
Because of such
feeling, we cannot accept

00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:50.673
any opinion from
any religion of ours.

00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:52.573
Not identical in any way.

00:11:54.404 --> 00:12:01.272
Now in the
western countries, where people

00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:03.239
are much settled

00:12:03.955 --> 00:12:08.127
They have acquired all
worldly power and wealth.

00:12:09.132 --> 00:12:14.914
Who have accumulated all sort of materials.

00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:21.330
Whatever could be possible other
than materialism, they did.

00:12:23.147 --> 00:12:25.363
Now these people turn and say

00:12:26.177 --> 00:12:30.997
Bhai! the joy, in search of which we
did everything, where that joy is lost.

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:38.845
No, we did not get any
pleasure, then leave all this, in this

00:12:39.679 --> 00:12:43.545
there is no pleasure; we get
lost in it, there is illusion in it.

00:12:43.595 --> 00:12:46.995
in it, leave it, their children left it,

00:12:48.562 --> 00:12:52.878
Their children abandoned it, leaving
everything behind, leaving their homes,

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:58.495
Dressed in sadhu's attire they
start smoking ganja vanja at home.

00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:04.452
now what is this way,
you see thousands have

00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:07.261
been strolling here,
all of them are saints,

00:13:07.511 --> 00:13:10.057
they are searching for God;
and they also smoke ganja,

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.627
and think that by smoking
ganja they have will find God.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:26.254
At such times Sahajyoga has been achieved,

00:13:27.927 --> 00:13:33.943
search for it, not outside, but
inside; great poets have said,

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:42.745
The King Janak's
incarnation was Nanak ji, and

00:13:42.746 --> 00:13:44.504
Nanak ji has said,

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:51.112
'Kahe Re vn, khojn jai, sada niwasi
sada alepa, tohe sng smai' means

00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:55.652
He says , it is absorbed within you,
then why are you going to search outside,

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:59.719
He says 'it is the self within you,
why then going to find outside,

00:14:03.324 --> 00:14:10.736
now what is that thing, who is it,
what is it like, this Let me tell you,

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:16.796
Sahaja Yogis should not come late,
all People's attention gets disturbed,

00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:23.716
You sir look here,

00:14:23.741 --> 00:14:27.102
what have you not seen women?
Men, haven't you seen the girls, look here,

00:14:27.688 --> 00:14:32.488
our minds stay here not for a
minute; we saying about finding self,

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.076
take your attention towards
yourself for a while. The

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.195
thing is, if you focus your
attention here and there,

00:14:38.355 --> 00:14:40.248
then how will we take
your attention inside.

00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:46.503
Focus here for a while, be calm,

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:49.942
because it is very subtle,

00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:57.943
very It is a subtle thing, it is
achieved through subtle devotion.

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:14.198
There is a system inside our body,

00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:17.475
which in English is called
Autonomous Nervous System.

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.291
We do know it as a
self-sustaining organization.

00:15:22.998 --> 00:15:29.957
This institution is located
within us in three ways,

00:15:31.943 --> 00:15:38.689
which we, the doctors, know by the name as
left and right sympathetic nervous system

00:15:38.923 --> 00:15:43.778
and para sympathetic nervous system.

00:15:46.902 --> 00:15:52.767
According to our Sahajyog Shastra, all

00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:58.657
these three
institutions are gross .

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.579
These are gross things that
are visible from outside and the

00:16:03.603 --> 00:16:08.102
institutions that run them are
You are seated in the bone.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:14.558
as I have shown you here, there are
three lines. See, these are three nadis,

00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:22.469
one is ida, one is pingla and
the middle one is Sushmna nadi.

00:16:24.513 --> 00:16:29.029
Now whether these nadis are there
or not, they are settled within us or not,

00:16:29.096 --> 00:16:33.113
whether or not
these are acting in a subtle way

00:16:33.237 --> 00:16:36.303
because you can see sympathetic
and parasympathetic,

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:44.747
but you cannot see these subtle nerves.
This can also be seen through Sahaj Yoga,

00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:49.447
but to see any subtle
thing, first

00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:55.847
you too would have to be
subtle, this is undisputed;

00:16:56.103 --> 00:16:59.280
With out being subtle, how will
you know-see the subtle thing,

00:16:59.613 --> 00:17:05.701
even if howsoever your eyes are today,
at whatever human level you are today

00:17:05.813 --> 00:17:09.668
we can show you the vibrations
of Kundalini, you can see

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:13.546
the movement of Kundalini.
You can see Kundalini rising.

00:17:15.479 --> 00:17:19.012
Any man, whether he is realized or not,

00:17:26.012 --> 00:17:33.434
In this subtle system, created in our
body, these three powers reside within us;

00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:40.523
The power which passes through
the right site and reaches the left site

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:47.460
that power is known by the name
of Goddess is Mahakali Shakti.

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:51.605
Now you will find this name strange
that Mata Ji says Mahakali shakti . Now the

00:17:51.629 --> 00:17:55.566
English people have not figured out, so
how do I give its English name.

00:18:00.255 --> 00:18:05.966
It is this Mahakali Shakti which
causes the existence of the entire world.

00:18:07.744 --> 00:18:14.922
due to this there is rhythm of the
whole world, there is annihilation.

00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:24.254
It happens
as if something

00:18:25.943 --> 00:18:30.499
it is situated for some reason, like we are
alive because of our heart,

00:18:30.988 --> 00:18:38.676
then when if heart stops, then we can also
be dead, this Shakti nurtures our heart,

00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:42.467
Its name is Mahakali Shakti

00:18:42.587 --> 00:18:48.365
and it is the emotional side of man.
What we English people call psyche,

00:18:48.642 --> 00:18:53.084
the functioning of psyche
is on this left hand side.

00:18:53.109 --> 00:18:55.231
It is caused by the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:58.774
but doctors do not accept it. Right
and left are considered the same,

00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:01.942
meaning doctor and psychologist,
do not even agree with each other.

00:19:02.365 --> 00:19:04.627
Its not that only I have
difference of opinion with them

00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:07.285
them, but they have a lot of
disagreement with each other too.

00:19:07.712 --> 00:19:10.366
It is that this psychologist is
not able to explain to the doctor

00:19:10.392 --> 00:19:12.592
and the doctor is unable
to explain to a psychologist.

00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:19.343
Human is psychology, is psyche
as well and he has a body too.

00:19:20.633 --> 00:19:25.254
he has emotions, he has
a mind, he is everything.

00:19:26.588 --> 00:19:31.499
Sahaj Yog finds out about
man, the way he is, in totality.

00:19:31.682 --> 00:19:35.364
It does not analyze differently
and slowly, the way science does,

00:19:35.388 --> 00:19:38.032
but is familiar with all about science.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.255
This Nadi that is on the left hand
side, we call it Mahakali Shakti.

00:19:50.099 --> 00:19:54.254
The existence of people is
due to this Mahakali Shakti.

00:19:54.321 --> 00:19:57.965
The existence of the whole
world is due to this Power.

00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:07.676
If this condition is not there, this power
is not there, the human can not exist.

00:20:07.788 --> 00:20:13.766
The whole world can not exist. But mind
it, this is the emotional state of God.

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:19.221
This is not implemented, this is the state.

00:20:21.338 --> 00:20:29.288
when this power is implemented
within us. So whatever dies within us,

00:20:30.288 --> 00:20:37.554
whatever thought comes within
us, arises. Whatever is our past.

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:41.821
It is governed by this, it keeps
storing whatever is inside us.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:49.475
What ever our Conditioning
happens, it all remains stored inside,

00:20:50.298 --> 00:20:51.648
Its recorded.

00:20:54.048 --> 00:21:01.564
We believe this as power of
Mahakali Shakti and the other power

00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:06.213
which is coming from our
left and reaching the right

00:21:06.758 --> 00:21:09.668
we are blessed by the
power of Maha Saraswati.

00:21:17.012 --> 00:21:23.224
All our work is done with
the power of Saraswati.

00:21:24.712 --> 00:21:32.695
All that work, movement of hands and legs;
Whatever we work for, for the future,

00:21:34.746 --> 00:21:39.262
Whatever we plan, whatever
we think for the future, this

00:21:40.819 --> 00:21:47.819
The power of our right hand side
comes from what we call Maha Saraswati.

00:21:52.793 --> 00:21:58.881
The power that exists between and in
between is called

00:21:59.104 --> 00:22:01.815
the power of Maha Lakshmi.

00:22:04.214 --> 00:22:07.802
Because of this Shakti

00:22:09.758 --> 00:22:11.847
our uplifting takes place.

00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:16.637
Our evolution happens,

00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:20.526
today we have become humans from
amoeba, it is because of this power,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.770
The present form of Human is
also because of this Shakti only.

00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:36.581
it is also due to this power. This power
establishes its religion in all things.

00:22:36.991 --> 00:22:41.669
Religion means, no need to worry,
religion means the religion of inside us.

00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:47.247
As there is self-regarding religion
of gold. That it doesn't go bad.

00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:48.657
This is unconventional.

00:22:51.489 --> 00:22:55.422
Carbon typically has four valencies.

00:22:55.489 --> 00:23:00.367
All elements and atoms have their
own characteristic properties, religion.

00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:03.212
Nettle is like Nettle.
While snake is like snake.

00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:10.612
In the same way, man is like man. Man's
religion is also established by this power.

00:23:11.546 --> 00:23:16.434
And today man has come to
this state only to establish religion.

00:23:17.814 --> 00:23:22.414
There are different human religions
and qualities, they come and go

00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:25.036
and when this religion is established,

00:23:25.137 --> 00:23:27.937
By reason of these ten
religions, man is then created.

00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:36.870
Due to the power of Maha Lakshmi, man

00:23:39.097 --> 00:23:42.159
can go to that state where he is to reach.

00:23:42.366 --> 00:23:44.655
This
is evolutionary power.

00:23:45.722 --> 00:23:50.500
Today this is your present , whatever
you are at this moment, it is that power.

00:23:53.744 --> 00:23:57.888
In this way, all three times
are present inside you:

00:23:58.254 --> 00:24:03.876
a past, a future,

00:24:04.364 --> 00:24:12.253
And this time is present, right
now, at this moment, at this moment.

00:24:16.187 --> 00:24:18.920
All three such powers are present
within us,

00:24:21.237 --> 00:24:26.764
and it is because of these powers
that Today man has reached this stage,

00:24:38.053 --> 00:24:42.201
Now, when we know, as this is
a mic, it was made or someone

00:24:43.699 --> 00:24:49.565
Even if any instrument is made then we do
not know at that time as to what is its use

00:24:49.878 --> 00:24:52.400
until when we don't
remove its coil from inside

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:55.276
it and do not connect to
the mains, it has no use.

00:24:56.322 --> 00:25:00.542
In the same way, a
human being also does not

00:25:00.566 --> 00:25:04.786
mean anything until he
connects his mind to its source.

00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:08.566
After that, it has also meant that

00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:14.399
my voice must flow from inside
and it becomes a hollow thing.

00:25:15.506 --> 00:25:20.398
This instrument has been made
so that it can carry my voice.

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:28.021
Later it happens that we
also become a hollow thing

00:25:28.178 --> 00:25:31.634
and that power spreads
from within us, starts flowing.

00:25:35.236 --> 00:25:37.402
From within us, it
starts flowing from our

00:25:37.426 --> 00:25:39.591
hands in the form of
waves of consciousness,

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.094
which We believe is
the power of the omnipresent God

00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:45.350
and that power is
the power of love.

00:25:45.594 --> 00:25:50.949
which is beyond all three powers
and is conjointly flowing all together,

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.283
all
three powers are there in that.

00:25:58.746 --> 00:26:04.857
Now look at this picture and look towards
God. That if we are the reflection of God

00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:10.879
Then these three powers
must be acting in God too.

00:26:11.146 --> 00:26:15.302
And as if we the microcosms
made up for inside of this.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.090
As if these are micro-isms, we
are microscopes, in this way one,

00:26:23.398 --> 00:26:28.512
One, we are also inside them,
made like them, sitting inside and

00:26:28.636 --> 00:26:32.902
We also just have to be aware

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.258
that the power of the omnipresent
God should flow from within us.

00:26:37.413 --> 00:26:43.680
Unless this happens you cannot
find happiness. Unless this happens

00:26:43.705 --> 00:26:50.866
You will not reach your goal of life, no
matter whatever worldly thing you may get.

00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:54.503
You can't get everything, you
won't find joy.

00:27:01.613 --> 00:27:06.725
What you are seeing right now in front of
you, in this we have shown many chakras.

00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:13.082
And it is through these chakras
that the kundilini comes upwards.

00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:25.367
Now I will describe these
seven chakras, which are in this.

00:27:25.431 --> 00:27:30.171
Now, don't doubt whether they are there or
not, or Mother is just talking otherwise.

00:27:30.911 --> 00:27:38.242
If you are a scientist, then
also the mind of a scientist,

00:27:38.792 --> 00:27:40.426
his intellect should be open.

00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:44.256
He must have an open mind.

00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:46.541
We are putting this hypothesis to you.

00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:53.704
You should accept it, you should
see it, and if it is true, and if it

00:27:53.754 --> 00:27:58.521
is proven, and if it is real,
then you should accept it.

00:28:05.763 --> 00:28:13.747
These seven subtle chakras within
us, they are definitely visible outside.

00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:16.380
And doctors know them
by the name of plexus.

00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:19.101
Along with that, I will
tell you their name also,

00:28:19.161 --> 00:28:23.175
Which from the emergence of
the subtle, from the manifestation,

00:28:23.199 --> 00:28:29.111
Outside present in the form
of plexus.

00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.960
People can see it.

00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:34.717
And they can understand
that with in us

00:28:34.751 --> 00:28:37.767
there is some institution, on which we
do not have any control.

00:28:40.451 --> 00:28:48.151
As your heart is beating on its own,
your stomach is working on its own;

00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:53.462
your breath is on its own, many
things are happening on its own.

00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:58.039
If you want to increase the speed of your
heart from that , then you can.

00:28:58.218 --> 00:29:01.862
If you start running, then
your heart can speed up.

00:29:02.136 --> 00:29:05.817
But it decreases on its
own, you can not reduce it.

00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:09.528
You can increase the speed of
your breath, you can not reduce it.

00:29:10.335 --> 00:29:15.512
The process of reducing
it is also automatic.

00:29:16.402 --> 00:29:24.274
Firstly, whatever you can increase
in, you can use in an emergency.

00:29:25.557 --> 00:29:31.071
which you ride over, that institution
is sympathetic nervous system.

00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:36.051
And that is on which you can't do
anything, that is parasympathetic.

00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:41.238
And sympathetic, as I told
you, runs from Ida and Pingla.

00:29:42.074 --> 00:29:46.585
And the parasympathetic is run by

00:29:46.696 --> 00:29:51.874
the middle institution, which
we call as Shushmna Nadi.

00:29:55.518 --> 00:30:00.918
Now these three veins

00:30:01.068 --> 00:30:08.984
there are some centers within us.

00:30:09.833 --> 00:30:15.067
In these centers, many deities are present.

00:30:15.372 --> 00:30:19.171
Now, many people will say, Mother, don't
talk about Deities, it is not scientific.

00:30:21.401 --> 00:30:24.381
But can the people of science
answer all the questions?

00:30:24.801 --> 00:30:32.121
If you ask a small question to a
doctor, that in our body, when any foreign

00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:35.941
foreign object, out side thing
comes, our body throws it out.

00:30:36.861 --> 00:30:39.545
It tries its best to throw it away.

00:30:42.545 --> 00:30:50.201
But when in our stomach, or may be said,
when a baby settles in a mother's womb,

00:30:50.226 --> 00:30:53.765
then nobody throws it away.

00:30:54.545 --> 00:30:58.826
We don't throw it away, but
we take care of it, we raise it.

00:30:58.851 --> 00:31:00.611
Who does this?

00:31:00.741 --> 00:31:02.683
Who takes its decision?

00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:04.681
Where does this differentiation come from?

00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:06.500
Does anyone think of it?

00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:08.861
How does this happen?

00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:15.174
That when a baby comes in
mother's womb, its raising starts,

00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:17.807
instead of throwing it away.

00:31:22.251 --> 00:31:25.591
There are many such questions,
which no doctor can answer.

00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:33.492
There are two chemicals called
acetycholine and acid-aline.

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:40.483
When they enter our body, or in our body

00:31:40.843 --> 00:31:42.856
they get activate then
their actions are different.

00:31:42.883 --> 00:31:47.546
For example, where we
want to relax, they augment it.

00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:51.611
Meaning, they make
it smaller, they pull it.

00:31:52.891 --> 00:31:58.471
Doctors say, we cannot explain
the mode of action of these.

00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:02.811
In many things, the answer
is like this, 'we cannot explain.'

00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:05.324
Alright! what they say is also true,

00:32:05.651 --> 00:32:08.324
And there is a lot of truth in
it, that at least are on the truth.

00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:12.451
But because their search is from
outside, from the darkness, when you go to

00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:15.284
some place, then you
don't see the whole thing.

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:17.143
You get one thing, the
get one, another thing.

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:18.651
You can't connect.

00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:22.346
Then you take one by one
things and do its analysis.

00:32:22.371 --> 00:32:25.787
Then you reach that place,
where the whole thing is there.

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:27.520
You forget that.

00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:32.371
You know that one doctor sees one
eye, another doctor sees the another eye.

00:32:34.587 --> 00:32:37.476
If you want to examine the whole
body, you have to warm the pockets of at

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:39.375
pay for least sixty doctors.

00:32:41.699 --> 00:32:49.587
When a human being is one, and his art, his
music, his poems, where do they come from,

00:32:49.698 --> 00:32:51.851
no one has any idea of it.

00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:55.491
Because when a man searches
from outside, then it so happens.

00:32:56.591 --> 00:33:01.502
But one thing can happen,
that if in the dark room,

00:33:01.591 --> 00:33:05.035
suddenly there is light, then
everything can be instantly recognized.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.230
This is our Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:09.869 --> 00:33:15.619
Within us, at the very
bottom, in the triangular bone,

00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:20.886
you will see a three and a
half, can you all see it?

00:33:22.171 --> 00:33:26.087
In three and a half circle,
in the wrap, there is a

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:28.337
power called Kundalini.

00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:31.991
Is it or not? I have already
told you, I will prove it to you.

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:36.594
This power remains in dormant state.

00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:45.871
It remains in dormant state
until it's authority comes in front.

00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:50.711
Its authority is very rare,

00:33:51.941 --> 00:33:53.697
almost none, know it.

00:33:54.991 --> 00:33:58.571
At least I have not found anyone,
since I have been born, I have not found.

00:33:58.571 --> 00:33:59.731
anyone in this birth.

00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:04.791
There are some people in the world,
whom I can say have transcended.

00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:08.331
But none of them, not even
one, does not appear in the world.

00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:10.401
All are sitting in the jungles.

00:34:10.871 --> 00:34:12.931
Very few, rarely one or two .

00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:15.031
One or half if seen is seen. (unclear)

00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:22.948
When it comes in front
of you, it gets manifested,

00:34:23.015 --> 00:34:25.515
because it is consciousness, awareness.

00:34:27.371 --> 00:34:29.531
It thinks, understands, organizes.

00:34:30.031 --> 00:34:36.471
We cannot understand if any power that
thinks, understands, coordinates and loves.

00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:39.147
We cannot understand any such power.

00:34:39.271 --> 00:34:42.151
But when we can do all this, then
there must be some such power.

00:34:42.237 --> 00:34:44.121
There must be a source for it.

00:34:44.671 --> 00:34:47.604
after all how can we do all this acts?

00:34:48.671 --> 00:34:52.351
What is not in the tree, where
in the fruit, did it come from?

00:34:54.401 --> 00:34:56.635
There must be a source for it somewhere.

00:34:56.721 --> 00:34:58.868
This power must be present somewhere.

00:34:59.041 --> 00:35:03.574
With which we love,
think and do all the work.

00:35:04.501 --> 00:35:08.407
Only a part of that power comes
inside you, inside everyone.

00:35:08.581 --> 00:35:16.234
In the same way it comes in the 'Sushmna
Nadi' and here, its in three circle

00:35:17.874 --> 00:35:20.441
wrap, it also has a great
Shastra, mathematics.

00:35:21.301 --> 00:35:22.621
It is present in you.

00:35:22.781 --> 00:35:24.341
Very beautiful arrangement.

00:35:25.621 --> 00:35:26.967
And its pure.

00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:29.981
Now many people say, that
we do Kundalini awakening.

00:35:38.031 --> 00:35:39.804
Many such people may be seen.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.691
Many have written books too.

00:35:43.846 --> 00:35:47.046
If you read those books and come,
you will get scared first, that Mata ji!

00:35:47.091 --> 00:35:49.846
Kundalini is very dreadful.

00:35:50.004 --> 00:35:51.913
She is your mother.

00:35:52.023 --> 00:35:54.846
Can your mother be ever dangerous?

00:35:55.011 --> 00:35:57.821
The whole world be
dangerous, Mother can't be?

00:35:57.891 --> 00:36:00.277
She is your separate mother.

00:36:00.302 --> 00:36:02.597
She is with you, having been
born along with in all lives.

00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:06.551
The mother who gave birth to you, she
may change, but that does not change.

00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:09.017
This Kundalini wanders with you.

00:36:09.095 --> 00:36:10.384
She is with you.

00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:12.139
She is present inside you again and again.

00:36:12.204 --> 00:36:13.324
She only knows you.

00:36:13.431 --> 00:36:14.871
She knows all your mistakes.

00:36:14.951 --> 00:36:18.039
She knows all your
Kundli (Past and future ).

00:36:18.039 --> 00:36:20.851
She is aware of all your karmas.

00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:22.006
What is that?

00:36:22.026 --> 00:36:23.959
Can she do anything bad with you?

00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:25.819
How can she do it?

00:36:27.651 --> 00:36:31.511
But those who do not have the
authority, they only write such bad things.

00:36:35.483 --> 00:36:42.719
If you see below the Kundalini,
there is a center of four petals .

00:36:44.241 --> 00:36:47.378
Where Kundalini is present, it is
called the Mooladhar (root chakr) .

00:36:47.481 --> 00:36:49.138
Because the root base is there.

00:36:49.364 --> 00:36:51.004
It is its abode, it is its house.

00:36:52.907 --> 00:37:00.881
And outside that abode, below it, much
below it, there is another it's center,

00:37:00.961 --> 00:37:04.521
is Mooladhara Chakra.

00:37:04.981 --> 00:37:06.401
Now this is a great difference.

00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:09.301
Mooladhara and Mooladhara Chakra.

00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:11.281
Mooladhara Chakra is present below.

00:37:11.801 --> 00:37:13.121
And Mooladhara is above.

00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:21.571
In Mooladhara, your mother, Kundalini,
Gauri Shakti Swarupni is sitting.

00:37:24.011 --> 00:37:25.680
Gauri is bathing,

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.224
And below, Ganesh Ji is protecting her.

00:37:31.881 --> 00:37:35.441
In this first center,
Shri Ganesh is sitting.

00:37:36.161 --> 00:37:39.181
Now someone will say, Mother,
where did you get Shri Ganesh from?

00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:42.461
Shri Ganesh is present there or not,

00:37:42.681 --> 00:37:44.169
This will be seen later.

00:37:44.681 --> 00:37:46.781
But Shri Ganesh is a symbol.

00:37:48.911 --> 00:37:54.781
Shri Ganesh is a symbol
of the child of Chirkal.

00:37:55.811 --> 00:37:58.137
Shri Ganesh is the child of Chirkal.

00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:01.351
There are many symbolic s within us.

00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:04.271
This is what psychologists believe.

00:38:04.444 --> 00:38:07.115
That way they have worked very hard.

00:38:07.248 --> 00:38:11.866
They say, we have such a universal,
unconscious, all-pervading, such an

00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:17.026
unconscious power which sends
symbols within us, as dream.

00:38:17.211 --> 00:38:19.596
They did not have that power of meditation,

00:38:19.628 --> 00:38:22.561
If they had, they would have seen it.

00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:25.473
But the one who has the
power to go into meditation

00:38:25.601 --> 00:38:29.451
can see that Shri Ganesh
is very much present here.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.555
And whether He is present or not,
as we move further in Kundalini Yoga

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.799
then we will show you, then
we will make you understand.

00:38:34.824 --> 00:38:36.705
All the people present
here have known about it.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.290
You have not come to know about it yet.

00:38:38.335 --> 00:38:40.374
You have not known yet, you too will know
about it.

00:38:40.399 --> 00:38:42.621
This is the abode of Shri Ganesha.

00:38:42.646 --> 00:38:47.079
Shri Ganesh is
present in this chakra

00:38:47.103 --> 00:38:52.057
because when you
want your Kundalini to

00:38:52.097 --> 00:38:54.825
then Mother Gauri may awaken

00:38:55.145 --> 00:39:01.951
In respect of Mother, like in a child
has innocence, sublimity, it should be in

00:39:02.529 --> 00:39:04.839
the matter of innocence
and check. (unclear)

00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:15.128
Because Shri Ganesh is
sitting on this four-winged wheel.

00:39:15.256 --> 00:39:18.217
With this wheel sex is also controlled.

00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:24.681
That is not a way to go to God, not at all.

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:30.681
if someone tries to go through that
way then Shri Ganesh becomes angry.

00:39:31.141 --> 00:39:33.081
Can you have sex with your Mother?

00:39:34.487 --> 00:39:38.947
Those who talk about sex they are
teaching you to have sex with your Mother.

00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:45.131
An Indian person can
understand it very well.

00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:50.211
Nothing more than this can
be any bad act, sin, or curse.

00:39:56.584 --> 00:40:00.104
On the Mooladhara chakra Shri Ganesh
is protecting the shame of his Mother.

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:10.238
But nowadays there are many new people have
come out, who call themselves Krishna ji.

00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:16.616
And they are spreading such dirty
things that you should sublimate your sex.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.438
You are already sublimated, you see!

00:40:19.727 --> 00:40:23.592
Your four-winged Mooladhara chkra
is down and Kundalini is on top of it.

00:40:24.236 --> 00:40:26.880
And because of doing
such things the heat

00:40:26.904 --> 00:40:30.671
that reaches you is the
anger of Shri Ganesha.

00:40:30.715 --> 00:40:32.446
He gets angry with you.

00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:35.624
And because of his anger
Kundalini gets irritated.

00:40:35.687 --> 00:40:36.701
Kundalini is everything.

00:40:36.781 --> 00:40:38.381
Kundalini is sitting, where it was.

00:40:38.407 --> 00:40:39.542
It does not move.

00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:47.491
It is the anger of Shri Ganesh
because of which beyond Kundalini

00:40:47.491 --> 00:40:55.454
Even without intervention of Kundalini the
sympathetic nervous system gets irritated.

00:40:56.604 --> 00:41:03.331
And inside you many types
of arrangements are formed.

00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:07.348
There some people, who
get possessed by evil souls.

00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:11.837
I have seen; people, tortured
by them, come to me; they are set right.

00:41:12.157 --> 00:41:13.873
Blisters are appear all over the body.

00:41:14.468 --> 00:41:20.213
Shri Ganesh gets so angry that many
people start shaking their hands and legs.

00:41:20.238 --> 00:41:22.726
Some people start shouting,
Some people start screaming;

00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:26.216
Some people take off their clothes,
Some people get intoxicated.

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:30.101
Some people start talking absurd.
Some start seeing light or the like.

00:41:30.317 --> 00:41:32.446
It is an indifferent
thing.

00:41:32.512 --> 00:41:34.779
I had just been to a
place in Kolhapur, there

00:41:34.802 --> 00:41:36.868
a man was sitting with
his feet towards me.

00:41:36.964 --> 00:41:39.214
Everyone said, don't sit
with your feet towards Mother.

00:41:39.336 --> 00:41:41.735
He said, let me sit this way
otherwise I jump like a frog.

00:41:41.779 --> 00:41:43.901
They said, why do you jump like a frog?

00:41:43.926 --> 00:41:49.291
My Guru has raised my Kundalini
that is why I jump like a frog.

00:41:49.471 --> 00:41:52.037
Don't lift Kundalini
like this for God sake.

00:41:52.291 --> 00:41:56.931
The thing which is for your benefit
and for your happiness the thing which is

00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:03.980
it's such a miss use, the extent
of disrespect what else can it be.

00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:10.330
There should not be
any such symptoms in it.

00:42:11.397 --> 00:42:14.922
Yes, surely it is may
be if you are not well.

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:18.462
It is possible that your Kundalini
will rise up a little and will go to the

00:42:18.506 --> 00:42:20.766
place where you are problem
and will get stuck up there.

00:42:20.835 --> 00:42:23.477
May stay there for one or two days.

00:42:23.595 --> 00:42:27.611
It is possible that you will
feel a little heat in your body.

00:42:27.699 --> 00:42:31.271
Or it is possible that to a
sahib there some skin problem

00:42:31.271 --> 00:42:34.871
His one thumb started flicker ring
like this. That's it. Not much of it.

00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:38.387
Because indications should also come.

00:42:42.897 --> 00:42:47.716
When this Kundalini gets awakened

00:42:47.741 --> 00:42:50.675
and all these chakras are called
the six chakra (Shath Chakra)

00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:53.619
because the seventh chakra is not to be

00:42:53.644 --> 00:42:56.607
pierced, it is above that, that's
why it is called the 'Shath chakra'.

00:42:56.632 --> 00:42:59.437
See, it is such a big established
thing that the seventh chakra

00:42:59.462 --> 00:43:02.699
which is the root
chakra, it is not pierced.

00:43:02.764 --> 00:43:06.210
That's why it should not be talked
about at the time of Kundalini.

00:43:06.299 --> 00:43:09.477
If you are an impious
person, you are licentious

00:43:09.511 --> 00:43:14.377
you did not care about your Ganesha
and you foolishly live all through the life

00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:16.907
Then it's necessary that
there will be vacuum inside you.

00:43:16.932 --> 00:43:19.265
And whenever the Kundalini
rises, instantly it drops down.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.573
It happens like that.

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:27.065
That is the another thing. If you have not
cared much about Ganesha then it may be

00:43:27.133 --> 00:43:29.621
Even then you get pardoned
a lot in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:29.668 --> 00:43:32.948
I have seen that many people live
like that, even then they are forgiven.

00:43:34.911 --> 00:43:40.885
It is very important that when you
have come in front of God and you wish

00:43:41.052 --> 00:43:45.868
that you get His blessings then you
should also check your piousness.

00:43:46.471 --> 00:43:48.135
Do we possess this purity?

00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:50.751
Do we recognise mothers
and sisters something or not?

00:43:52.962 --> 00:43:54.695
It is very important.

00:43:54.766 --> 00:44:00.346
If the root chakra is damaged then
many problems of sex can occur.

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:03.311
Like constipation etc.
can also occur.

00:44:03.336 --> 00:44:06.762
Because it is the chakra at
the very bottom of rectum.

00:44:08.981 --> 00:44:15.964
Above that you see in the middle
of the stomach which we call Nabhi.

00:44:16.301 --> 00:44:17.697
It is a Nabhi chakra.

00:44:18.361 --> 00:44:21.031
People also call it Manipura chakra.

00:44:21.401 --> 00:44:23.401
Nabhi chakra or Manipura chakra.

00:44:25.081 --> 00:44:30.437
Manipura chakra
is exactly behind the

00:44:30.737 --> 00:44:34.371
Nabhi in the
backbone, at this place.

00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:44.574
And with this the plexus which works

00:44:45.341 --> 00:44:48.524
that is called solar plexus in English.

00:44:49.651 --> 00:44:55.371
This chakra is in the backbone
but the plexus is in front of it.

00:44:55.611 --> 00:44:58.598
because it is outside the backbone.

00:44:58.891 --> 00:44:59.951
This is gross.

00:45:00.811 --> 00:45:07.671
And the subtle chakra is inside the
backbone in the medulla oblongata which we

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:11.812
In Biology is medulla oblongata,
inside the spinal cord in that.

00:45:14.891 --> 00:45:20.839
So this chakra which is
the solar plexus; this only

00:45:20.863 --> 00:45:26.811
functions all the organs
of our stomach.

00:45:32.321 --> 00:45:36.774
Apart from this, you see one chakra which

00:45:37.474 --> 00:45:40.274
coming out of this
chakra rotates all around.

00:45:40.961 --> 00:45:42.894
This is called Swadhisthana chakra.

00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:47.805
And in this chakra there are six petals.

00:45:48.341 --> 00:45:50.141
On this Shri Brahmadev resides.

00:45:50.141 --> 00:45:52.794
And Saraswati is his power.

00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:58.201
The Nabhi chakra in
that Shri Vishnu resides.

00:45:58.761 --> 00:46:00.141
And Lakshmi ji is his power.

00:46:03.291 --> 00:46:06.696
Now imagine that a
person is extremely poor.

00:46:07.671 --> 00:46:10.231
May be that his Nabhi chakra is damaged.

00:46:12.206 --> 00:46:15.717
Due to the damage of Nabhi chakra the Nabhi
chakra of our country itself is damaged.

00:46:15.937 --> 00:46:19.228
That is why there is more poverty here.

00:46:19.339 --> 00:46:21.428
You may worship Lakshmi ji a lot,

00:46:21.492 --> 00:46:23.673
You may do all of the worldly acts.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:25.628
But it is of no use to you.

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:29.216
As long as your Nabhi chakra is not
good your condition will not be good.

00:46:29.241 --> 00:46:32.191
But Lakshmi ji does not mean a rich person.

00:46:32.441 --> 00:46:35.524
You have to understand this
clearly time and again, many times.

00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:39.354
Today I will tell you about these two
chakras and will get you to meditate.

00:46:39.441 --> 00:46:42.018
Tomorrow I will tell about the rest.

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:45.136
I will tell you about Lakshmi ji
and Saraswati ji.

00:46:47.076 --> 00:46:51.040
This is not an imagination.
This is established, a reality.

00:46:51.104 --> 00:46:54.524
Because Nabhi chakra
establishes dharma within us.

00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:57.081
There are ten dharmas of a human being.
It must be there.

00:46:57.126 --> 00:46:59.569
If it breaks from the ten
dharmas of a human being

00:46:59.593 --> 00:47:02.146
then it is not useful for Sahajyoga.

00:47:02.505 --> 00:47:05.481
His dharmas need to be tied up.

00:47:05.852 --> 00:47:09.111
He cannot be awakened;
These are ten dharmas.

00:47:09.136 --> 00:47:11.816
It should be minimum within us.

00:47:11.841 --> 00:47:16.173
Only when these are there can a
person become a religious person.

00:47:16.295 --> 00:47:19.474
Lakshmi ji is shown as a feminine form.

00:47:19.697 --> 00:47:22.563
Alike woman, must have a mother's heart.

00:47:22.607 --> 00:47:25.085
The man who has money,

00:47:25.222 --> 00:47:33.119
Lakshmipati should be the one who is
the most loving and has motherhood in him.

00:47:37.935 --> 00:47:41.855
Secondly, Lakshmi ji is
standing on a lotus. She is Light.

00:47:42.981 --> 00:47:49.541
The man who should be called Lakshmipati
should have so much lightness in him.

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:53.845
He should be so simple
that he can stand on a lotus.

00:47:55.023 --> 00:48:00.443
We see if someone has a
little money he is so proudly,

00:48:00.645 --> 00:48:04.187
Mother, I do have to transcend

00:48:04.232 --> 00:48:06.632
but I can't come to your
hall among everyone.

00:48:06.676 --> 00:48:08.698
You have to come to my house.

00:48:08.941 --> 00:48:12.076
i asked why,
because you have a little more money?

00:48:12.276 --> 00:48:16.143
You cannot sit with everyone.

00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:18.980
Such a man should not have any proud.

00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:20.814
He should not have even a little proud.

00:48:20.997 --> 00:48:22.381
Only then he is a Lakshmipati.

00:48:22.491 --> 00:48:25.997
If he is proud of his
money then he is gone.

00:48:26.131 --> 00:48:27.664
Then what kind of a rich person is he?

00:48:27.691 --> 00:48:32.471
If he is a real rich person,
that's the thing, he must

00:48:32.496 --> 00:48:34.651
be proud of anything.

00:48:34.754 --> 00:48:39.250
He proud only when he has
someone else's belonging.

00:48:40.473 --> 00:48:42.553
Or he is very short of it now.

00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:44.451
That is why he is proud.

00:48:44.476 --> 00:48:47.098
When he is complete he is never proud.

00:48:47.195 --> 00:48:52.398
Have we ever been proud
of our nose, eyes, and ears?

00:48:56.741 --> 00:49:02.161
In her both hands, in Lakshmi ji's
both hands there is a lotus, pink in color.

00:49:03.281 --> 00:49:08.607
Pink color lotus are blooming.

00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:18.567
It means that a Lakshmipati's heart
should be open like these lotuses.

00:49:20.545 --> 00:49:23.012
One should have an open heart.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:27.967
Someone comes and he starts barking
at him, what kind of a Lakshmipati is he?

00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:31.201
He is a dog.
He cannot be a Lakshmipati.

00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:38.050
Like a lotus whose fragrance
is spread all over the world.

00:49:38.251 --> 00:49:41.811
If its known, a Lakshmipati lives here,
bow your head in front of him. and say to

00:49:41.811 --> 00:49:44.871
Then they say to themselves that this
is the man. Now Lakshmi is on his head.

00:49:45.867 --> 00:49:48.871
Lakshmi cannot be on head.

00:49:48.896 --> 00:49:51.104
He is money minded,
he is not a Lakshmipati.

00:49:51.182 --> 00:49:53.682
Behind them people say,'
Oh! he is such a drunkard'.

00:49:53.707 --> 00:49:58.454
he is this, he is that; he is black
marketeer, he is this, he is that.

00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:02.532
No one praises him. There is no
grace in him. There is no beauty in him.

00:50:02.557 --> 00:50:09.646
There was
a man in my family when I was born.

00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:13.691
His name was D. Lakshminarayan.
He was a very rich man.

00:50:15.431 --> 00:50:17.497
You can call him a Lakshmipati.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.670
He was a extremely elated man,
very simple.

00:50:20.695 --> 00:50:23.597
He was like a child.
But I have seen many many such people.

00:50:23.622 --> 00:50:27.640
Very few.
Very few are like this.

00:50:29.885 --> 00:50:32.526
They should have a house like a lotus.

00:50:32.551 --> 00:50:37.215
Beautiful, rosy in which
there is a rosiness of the heart.

00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:40.451
There should be a attraction of the heart.
People should be accepted.

00:50:40.831 --> 00:50:46.667
Everyone should come there. Even a dumb
person should have a lotus in his hand.

00:50:46.801 --> 00:50:48.351
He should be comfortable.

00:50:48.417 --> 00:50:51.417
He should sleep very comfortably.
There should be a coziness of the lotus.

00:50:52.486 --> 00:50:55.674
There should be a kindness of his heart.

00:50:55.699 --> 00:50:57.139
Have you seen anyone like this?

00:50:57.164 --> 00:50:59.501
If you see anyone like
this, come and tell me.

00:51:00.821 --> 00:51:03.281
It is very difficult.
He got money and behaving like a donkey.

00:51:04.921 --> 00:51:07.121
If nothing happened,
so drank or else gambled.

00:51:07.581 --> 00:51:09.061
Is it a man's intellect or what?

00:51:11.542 --> 00:51:14.582
He got money and his intellect
always goes in the opposite direction.

00:51:14.607 --> 00:51:17.104
A man's intellect is
worse than that of a horse.

00:51:17.141 --> 00:51:21.202
It is surprising to think about it.

00:51:21.435 --> 00:51:24.136
He never gets good intellect with
money, of what use such person is?

00:51:24.161 --> 00:51:26.619
What is the use of such money?

00:51:26.664 --> 00:51:30.535
The same money is of use.
With that, a man gets good intellect.

00:51:30.574 --> 00:51:31.902
His religion is awakened.

00:51:31.969 --> 00:51:36.977
God gives you more money because
with your hands the religious work of the

00:51:37.002 --> 00:51:38.780
There is welfare of the world.

00:51:39.001 --> 00:51:42.181
Religious work and money have a
very close relationship, I am telling you.

00:51:42.761 --> 00:51:44.141
You believe it or not.

00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:47.321
Yesterday I told that I
went to someone's house.

00:51:47.581 --> 00:51:49.681
He said, Mother, you must come here,

00:51:49.741 --> 00:51:52.061
There are very rich people here.

00:51:52.441 --> 00:51:54.581
I said, I don't understand anything.

00:51:54.721 --> 00:51:57.684
I said, I will go.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:59.669
There are many
people on the way.

00:51:59.694 --> 00:52:03.351
As soon as I stepped in, I said,
there is a curse on this house.

00:52:03.712 --> 00:52:04.872
He said, how?

00:52:04.897 --> 00:52:06.684
I said, there is a curse on this house.

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:10.672
I went to his house and saw
that there were two young boys.

00:52:10.754 --> 00:52:12.472
They were sitting on a chair all the time.

00:52:12.497 --> 00:52:14.422
Their feet were like
this, their hands like this.

00:52:14.447 --> 00:52:15.489
They could not sleep.

00:52:15.523 --> 00:52:18.422
They were like this since birth.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.231
What is the use of that money?

00:52:21.357 --> 00:52:24.574
Will you roam around with an elephant?

00:52:24.607 --> 00:52:26.990
Both of your children
have become like this.

00:52:27.091 --> 00:52:29.924
I felt that this house is cursed.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.224
The curse of money is done.

00:52:32.311 --> 00:52:39.244
If you earn money its value is
in the arrangement of religion.

00:52:39.324 --> 00:52:40.980
In the same way, many houses are cursed.

00:52:41.005 --> 00:52:43.365
If you see someone's
wife, she has gone mad.

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:45.323
Something has happened to someone,

00:52:45.406 --> 00:52:47.222
Someone says, there
is no child in our house.

00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:49.657
Someone says, something
happens, something happens.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.574
Not having a child is not a curse.

00:52:51.604 --> 00:52:56.256
But the way it affects them is a curse.

00:52:56.334 --> 00:53:01.236
That is why there is a big
relationship of money and religion.
