00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:14.648
Sahaja yogi: There is a very good question,
Shri Mataji:

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.968
“Why Jesus Christ and different incarnations
had to pass through the crucifixion?”

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.563
Shri Mataji: Oh, is a question of why
Christ had to pass through crucifixion.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:42.273
From Bible we cannot understand Christ
so well

00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:48.711
because only His short life of about four
years is really there.

00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:02.141
But actually He is Omkara. He is the Alpha
and Omega as said. He is that.

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:10.085
And He took His form as an embodiment
of innocence.

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:22.437
The original mistake we committed when
it was the question of Adam and Eve.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:36.523
Now at that time we made a mistake. If we
had listen to what was to be,

00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:41.031
we would have been realized souls long time
back.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:53.617
But we wanted to know everything ourselves
so we developed a terrible ego.

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:05.211
As a result of that we crossed over within
ourselves. When we raised our heads

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:09.367
as human beings we crossed over
our attention, and there was a big cross

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:13.132
through which nothing could pass through.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.375
So the man, the human being, was lost
between the cross-roads

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:32.273
of the conditioning and the ego.

00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:48.117
And to pass the Kundalini through that
chakra was an impossibility.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.461
So before Christ, it was believed in India
that we have to repent for our misdeeds

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.375
and we have to become very humble to get
over our ego.

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:15.172
But it was prophesized that Mahavishnu
will come,

00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:19.601
and He will do the needful for you
for Agnya Chakra.

00:03:26.023 --> 00:03:32.086
So when Christ came, people did not
understand Him in the West

00:03:32.287 --> 00:03:36.249
or in Israel and all these places. They
never understood Him,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.968
what sort of a personality He was.

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:49.594
So Indians still believed that Mahavishnu
still has to come

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:54.153
who will suck our ego and superego.

00:04:00.182 --> 00:04:06.246
Krishna has said before Christ that
the eternal life cannot be killed,

00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:11.075
cannot be crucified, cannot be destroyed.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.276
So Christ came, who was the embodiment
of eternal life,

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:30.487
who was the embodiment of innocence,
who could not be killed.

00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:33.292
And that’s why His resurrection had to take
place.

00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:40.075
That’s why He was to be crucified to show
that eternal life can be resurrected.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.979
So He was placed at that cross
as the symbol of resurrection.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.950
The message of Christ is resurrection.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:19.448
But now we have to understand how a great
part has been played

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:23.839
by the crucifixion of Christ.

00:05:33.296 --> 00:05:40.174
There is a cross between of optic chiasma
within us also

00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:47.901
and our ego and our conditioning are
on both the sides

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.636
are trying to press it hard, there’s
no room to go in.

00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:08.346
Because Christ was the embodiment of Logos,
of the Omkara,

00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:16.325
the Chaitanya what you call the vibrations.
He’s the only one who could pass through.

00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:34.723
So He established a path for us
of resurrection.

00:06:38.852 --> 00:06:46.325
But the way they talk about sufferings
I can’t understand.

00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:54.153
He has already suffered for us.

00:06:57.018 --> 00:07:00.973
He has suffered for our sins.

00:07:03.035 --> 00:07:07.693
When He’s awakened here He sucks in on both
the sides as you see,

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:15.067
the karmas, the conditionings, the ego,
just like that He sucks in.

00:07:22.385 --> 00:07:29.545
And an area is made here which is a soft
bone in your childhood,

00:07:29.746 --> 00:07:34.512
it becomes again soft and the Kundalini
comes out of it.

00:07:45.494 --> 00:07:54.285
Is absolutely wrong, against Christ to say
that you have to suffer to go to God.

00:08:01.087 --> 00:08:04.660
Can we suffer more than Him?

00:08:06.191 --> 00:08:12.739
Or do you mean to say that He has left some
sufferings for us to be done?

00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:23.340
His is the message of joy

00:08:25.158 --> 00:08:31.070
and of resurrection and not of suffering.

00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:35.795
Even in India there are many people who
say, “You have done bad karmas

00:08:35.996 --> 00:08:42.793
so you must give so much money, you must
do this, you must do that.”

00:08:52.388 --> 00:08:58.457
His crucifixion was a part of the game
because He had to make

00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:05.394
the way in the Agnya Chakra. To cross
the Agnya Chakra He was crucified.

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:10.715
But His message is not crucifixion.

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:17.246
People wear the cross and I feel very hurt
about it. He crucified Himself,

00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:23.056
but that’s not the message, that’s not
[what] you should celebrate,

00:09:23.257 --> 00:09:27.473
that He crucified. There are people who
celebrate it!

00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:31.736
You have to celebrate His resurrection,

00:09:31.937 --> 00:09:38.822
the Resurrection because human beings are
to be resurrected.

00:09:39.023 --> 00:09:41.744
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is crucified

00:09:41.945 --> 00:09:46.156
and is resurrected because of one
crucifixion of Christ.

00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:50.413
That was enough! That was sufficient.

00:09:50.614 --> 00:09:55.913
You can’t carry the cross on your
shoulders, you don’t have to.

00:09:56.114 --> 00:09:58.632
He has carried for you. He has done
everything for you.

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:02.976
Is said also that He died for
all the sinners – is a fact.

00:10:03.177 --> 00:10:08.101
If He had not done that, it would have been
difficult to open your Agnyas

00:10:08.302 --> 00:10:13.507
because two problems, I told you:
is conditionings and ego.

00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:19.921
His crucifixion has helped the loosening

00:10:20.122 --> 00:10:28.226
of these two horrible capacities of human
beings.

00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:42.695
His life is to be understood in a very,
very deep sense.

00:10:44.793 --> 00:10:50.226
But if you are like a journalist, you can
say, “Why did He crucify Himself?

00:10:50.427 --> 00:10:54.414
If He was God, why did He get crucified?”.

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:58.825
Now the question is ‘why He got crucified?’

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:04.207
is how to tell these journalists who don’t
know anything about chakras.

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:11.942
Because it was the era or the time
of tapasya, of sacrifice

00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:19.417
and so then all these three persons,
Buddha, Mahavira and Christ,

00:11:19.618 --> 00:11:25.457
went into complete renunciation.

00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:34.089
They led a life of a great tapasvis.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:40.698
They did it for us, not for themselves.
They did not need it.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:48.050
They didn’t want it, but they had to do it
to cleanse us,

00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:54.379
to give us a proper medha, as they call it,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:12:01.198
these Ekadesha Rudras, you see, to be
cleared out.

00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:04.798
And they have sacrificed their lives.

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:08.329
They have sacrificed all the pleasures
of life.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:14.540
For them, it was not a sacrifice. It is
just a kind of a life they wanted to have.

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:19.993
For such people, there’s no question
of sacrifice, but is a question

00:12:20.194 --> 00:12:29.305
of doing something that would help to open
the chakras of the people in the future.

00:12:29.506 --> 00:12:32.407
Without them we could not have worked out
Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:32.623 --> 00:12:43.048
It was essential for these people
to cleanse for us these three chakras,

00:12:43.249 --> 00:12:47.298
part of the one chakra of Christ.

00:12:49.467 --> 00:12:54.855
All this they have worked out and that’s
why today Sahaja Yoga

00:12:55.056 --> 00:13:00.490
is so beautifully created,

00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:06.964
so beautifully spreading, is working out.
We have to thank them, very much.

00:13:07.165 --> 00:13:10.269
Of course, all other incarnations also have
helped,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.316
you can see – Vishuddhi, then also Heart,

00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:16.604
and all these, just right Heart,
left Heart.

00:13:16.805 --> 00:13:21.589
All these angels, as they are called
in the Bible,

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.785
have helped us to cross over.

00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:29.894
All these incarnations are responsible
in our evolutionary process

00:13:30.063 --> 00:13:34.253
to create these ladders for us to move.

00:13:35.736 --> 00:13:39.503
So, ultimately, you reach

00:13:41.024 --> 00:13:44.935
the state of tapa on the sixth centre

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:49.766
and then in the state of Truth, satya.

00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:54.883
Then the Truth comes to you through
Sahaja Yoga

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:59.156
in the brain, in the limbic area, when
the Kundalini enters,

00:13:59.357 --> 00:14:06.562
She puts light there. She creates
enlightened personalities

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:12.883
and then She joins this All-pervading Power
of Divine Love.

00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:21.767
And with this Divine Love, you are
completely changed and transformed.

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:30.377
So their contribution to the ascent
of human beings

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:35.268
has been great and that of Christ has been
the greatest.
