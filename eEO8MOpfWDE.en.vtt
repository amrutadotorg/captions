00:00.533 --> 00:03.523
﻿…Then what can rationality do?

00:05.920 --> 00:09.209
There must be some
reason for having rationality in us,

00:09.448 --> 00:14.014
why God has given us rationality,
He doesn’t waste his diamonds like that!

00:15.495 --> 00:19.590
Rationality gives us the sense to understand,

00:19.826 --> 00:23.248
that we cannot reach there through rationality

00:26.210 --> 00:31.106
Because unless and until this thing
happens to you, you are not going to believe in it.

00:31.622 --> 00:36.772
You are not going to believe in it that, this
rationality, on which we depend, which is our support,

00:37.004 --> 00:42.743
which is we; we all the time think that
our identification is complete with rationality.

00:42.943 --> 00:46.789
And we are very rational and
we are proud of our rationality also.

00:46.990 --> 00:50.725
So then, you reach a point, through rationality,

00:50.926 --> 00:55.074
where you understand that this is not
the horse which will be useful any further.

00:56.416 --> 00:58.759
This is the use of rationality!

00:58.959 --> 01:02.078
One way it takes you to that culminating point

01:02.278 --> 01:06.727
where you think it is to be
discarded or cannot be depended upon.

01:06.928 --> 01:08.928
On the other side,

01:10.357 --> 01:17.712
rationality gives you a view.

01:18.372 --> 01:22.583
A view which can be related
later on, when you get the experience.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.022
You start understanding
why rationality was failing you.

01:30.404 --> 01:33.427
So it’s a teacher on a negative way.

01:34.666 --> 01:36.821
It’s a teacher on a negative way.

01:37.142 --> 01:42.348
But it is essential because man was given freedom

01:42.660 --> 01:46.397
and he started using his freedom,

01:46.598 --> 01:49.743
he started using his rationality.

01:52.350 --> 01:56.717
When he reaches that point
then he starts depending on his wisdom.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.487
And wisdom is the balance,

02:01.177 --> 02:05.113
between his emotionality and rationality,

02:05.542 --> 02:12.366
in the centre of it,
between his heart and his mind.

02:12.723 --> 02:18.071
It is a centre somewhere there,
in the central, or you say in the fulcrum.

02:19.444 --> 02:24.978
So if you are too much on the
emotionality, or too much on the rationality,

02:25.301 --> 02:30.150
you have to move further into
the centre and balance it at a point,

02:30.610 --> 02:35.689
then only you are in wisdom,
and that’s how you rise within yourself.

02:36.055 --> 02:41.628
Any extreme behaviour, on the left or the
right, or dependance, is not going to help you.

02:44.103 --> 02:47.267
This you can understand through even emotionality.

02:48.143 --> 02:50.470
A person who is very emotional:

02:53.062 --> 02:57.878
he sort of ‘loves’ someone, loves, you see;

02:58.498 --> 03:04.885
and he goes ahead with sincerity
after that love, and he gets into infatuation.

03:07.244 --> 03:13.819
An then he realises, “Oh! This is
not joy. How could I have failed?”

03:14.339 --> 03:17.394
So he says, “I have a broken heart ”.

03:19.324 --> 03:24.486
It’s better that he realises
that. So he turns to his head.

03:24.852 --> 03:30.415
But he turns to his head, his head to such an
extreme that he gives up his broken heart completely.

03:30.924 --> 03:35.903
It is in the centre, in the centre of your heart

03:36.103 --> 03:40.375
and your brain, lies this fulcrum point.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.936
Rationality and emotionality

03:46.690 --> 03:50.764
are two extremes, but in the centre of it.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.769
So wisdom is an abstract word. What is wisdom?

03:54.970 --> 03:58.725
You ask somebody, “Is it wisdom?”

03:58.926 --> 04:01.589
“This is wisdom? That is wisdom?”

04:02.334 --> 04:07.214
Then how do you understand the wisdom? By
discarding, by saying, “No, this is not wisdom,”

04:07.414 --> 04:11.018
“This is not wisdom,” “This cannot be wisdom ”.

04:11.296 --> 04:14.121
Here you use both your emotionality

04:14.321 --> 04:18.791
and your rationality, when
you start deciding that this is.

04:18.991 --> 04:22.415
That’s why I said these are negative teachers:

04:23.707 --> 04:26.616
in the sense that they
drive you towards positivity.

04:26.816 --> 04:29.739
In the sense that they
drive you towards the Reality.

04:30.818 --> 04:35.275
They teach you that this is not the correct.

04:35.952 --> 04:38.630
Take any one of your,

04:38.944 --> 04:45.131
say ‘political enterprises’, as I would call
them, ‘political institutions’ as you call them:

04:45.506 --> 04:52.359
take communism, take capitalism, take all
these sorts of isms that you have all around.

04:52.807 --> 04:58.545
All experiments, all your political experiments,
which you have found through your rational approaches –

04:58.746 --> 05:00.905
they cannot give you a solution.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.775
Democracy fails, communism also fails.

05:11.039 --> 05:16.700
Any other monarchy fails. In the
same way demonocracy also fails.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.280
Everything fails! Then you realise that,

05:20.480 --> 05:24.891
“Is there any truth in
going through these things?”

05:25.954 --> 05:29.529
“Is this the way we are going to reach anywhere?”

05:29.819 --> 05:32.899
Then you start understanding,

05:34.755 --> 05:38.772
“That, no, no. We all have
made some mistakes somewhere ”.

05:39.183 --> 05:43.458
But this is not possible for
people who are running the race

05:44.002 --> 05:46.354
who are running the race it is not possible.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.716
For example, I cannot talk
to bureaucrats – impossible –

05:50.165 --> 05:53.887
because they are holding,
they are carrying the bags.

05:54.318 --> 05:58.810
So, some are democratic some are
communistic, I don’t know what sort of whims they have.

05:59.011 --> 06:01.693
So these big Johnnies
are not going to listen to us.

06:01.894 --> 06:07.683
No, they cannot! Because
for them that is identified.

06:07.884 --> 06:13.980
To them that, what they call,
is a ‘perfect’ political institution,

06:14.181 --> 06:17.950
is the whole of life,
and everybody must come to it!

06:19.712 --> 06:27.621
That’s why, when these different
ideologies and different isms start flowering,

06:28.220 --> 06:32.478
you find that they have not yet reached
any flowering

06:32.678 --> 06:36.730
and they just shrivel up,
they lose their existence,

06:37.582 --> 06:41.501
because rationality doesn’t
give you that complete picture.

06:44.099 --> 06:51.549
It doesn’t give you the complete
idea as to how far man can progress,

06:53.941 --> 06:56.700
with rationality

06:56.901 --> 07:00.787
and how far he is going to achieve the result.

07:00.987 --> 07:05.592
What is the result?
What do we expect? Is to have joy.

07:07.720 --> 07:14.634
But any democracies or any
communistic countries or any despotic countries,

07:14.834 --> 07:21.254
anywhere you go, you will find the people
have no joy; they have forgotten how to even smile!

07:21.789 --> 07:26.789
You have give them an
injection to make them laugh!

07:28.846 --> 07:33.987
So, this rationality gives us an understanding,

07:34.346 --> 07:41.193
that all our endeavours or all our enterprises
which have been brought forth through rationality,

07:41.394 --> 07:44.297
are not fulfilling.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.162
They show us something
but finish off, wither away.

07:49.479 --> 07:53.640
Same with our emotionality like we have,

07:53.840 --> 07:56.590
we have ‘faith’ in God.

07:58.422 --> 08:04.206
You have faith in God, so anybody who
says, “I am God” people run after such a person.

08:04.764 --> 08:07.087
There are many who are crazied like that!

08:07.382 --> 08:10.357
The other day only, I was watching a TV show

08:10.557 --> 08:15.228
where they showed a man who said,
“I am Christ” and he was the follower of Hitler.

08:15.842 --> 08:21.468
And he was killing people and he was doing
all kinds of things and he had a big following!

08:22.454 --> 08:28.108
And the people were crying and
weeping for him when he was facing his trial.

08:28.653 --> 08:31.611
One cannot explain these
things, how these things happen.

08:32.264 --> 08:35.548
How can God be that poorly?

08:36.312 --> 08:40.654
And how could people who
are talking about God could be like this?

08:41.295 --> 08:44.157
Because they play on
the emotionality of the people.

08:45.787 --> 08:49.671
They think, “Oh I feel very fine” “I have
seen many of these people to come in,”

08:49.871 --> 08:54.935
“Oh I feel very fine in his company, that
guru met me,” “Oh I feel very happy here!”

08:55.135 --> 08:59.847
What did he do? How do you feel
fine? What does it appeal to you?

09:00.047 --> 09:05.879
It is such a subtle type
of diversion from the Reality.

09:06.079 --> 09:10.583
It’s such a subtle type,
that you cannot even make out.

09:11.366 --> 09:14.955
Specially rational people
cannot, they are befooled the first!

09:15.861 --> 09:22.128
The so called ego-oriented people
are befooled the first with emotionality.

09:22.477 --> 09:25.003
To them anybody who comes with emotions –

09:25.203 --> 09:31.899
stands up with very big emotions and
tears in the eyes and shouts at the loud speaker

09:32.100 --> 09:36.492
and as if he is just going to die with the pangs,

09:36.692 --> 09:40.246
or something like that  – appeals so much.

09:40.473 --> 09:45.921
Because that’s the balance for
their rational minds, that they fall a trap.

09:47.650 --> 09:52.492
So this kind of a emotionality also
can go to another extreme of madness!

09:53.586 --> 09:56.829
Like you have seen people
singing songs of separation with God.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.075
It sickens me sometimes the way it is done.

10:00.275 --> 10:02.602
It’s sickening! I don’t know how people like it.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.671
The other day we had that musician who came to me,

10:05.872 --> 10:08.012
so I said, “You sing me a song”,

10:08.213 --> 10:10.662
he said “What type of
song, Mother, You want to hear?”

10:10.862 --> 10:13.875
I said, “Sing us some song of joy”

10:14.076 --> 10:16.344
“Song of joy?” He was lost!

10:16.545 --> 10:22.168
He said, “They have produced no song of joy for
the last twenty years in this country anywhere!”

10:22.369 --> 10:26.726
None of them in the English
society or the Western people.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.668
I said, “No song of joy?”

10:30.045 --> 10:36.251
He picked up something somewhere, and
which also had a string of crying and weeping in it.

10:36.897 --> 10:40.817
I said, “Now there is no absolute joy anywhere!”

10:44.817 --> 10:48.436
Just think of it!
The emotionality has reached to such an extent

10:48.637 --> 10:51.626
that you have lost all praise of joy, completely.

10:52.336 --> 10:56.986
So, we cannot depend on that
kind of an emotionality that –

10:57.186 --> 11:00.523
in the church, you go and
somebody stands on the pulpit and says,

11:00.723 --> 11:08.635
“Oh, I am like that!” with all the vibrating
sounds and all that drama of emotionality.

11:08.985 --> 11:12.439
And you say “Oh!
What a thing! Oh I was very happy!”

11:15.670 --> 11:22.015
If such a thing is accepted in
life, I can tell you, be rest assured,

11:23.348 --> 11:25.952
that when such a thing appeals to you,

11:26.152 --> 11:30.523
you must know that you
are not facing the Reality at all.

11:31.609 --> 11:34.311
You are not prepared to face the Reality.

11:34.511 --> 11:38.244
You do not want to face it!
You might give any excuse about it.

11:38.444 --> 11:43.860
You might identify yourself as,
“Oh, I am too much of a rational person,

11:44.060 --> 11:48.942
I am too rational, I cannot accept
this. This is beyond me, I just can’t!”

11:49.412 --> 11:52.690
or you may even say, “I am
English, bit too English I cannot accept it!”

11:52.912 --> 11:57.584
Or somebody may say that, “I am too much of
an Indian, I cannot accept this kind of a thing ”.

11:59.189 --> 12:03.123
But when you say you are an
Indian, first of all, you are misidentifying.

12:03.324 --> 12:07.598
and secondly you are misidentifying
with one extreme or the other extreme.

12:09.550 --> 12:14.299
So before starting about your seeking,

12:14.567 --> 12:18.316
you have to understand yourself
– which extreme you are standing.

12:18.549 --> 12:20.560
Very important.

12:21.048 --> 12:23.877
Very important it is to understand this part,

12:24.077 --> 12:29.115
“Where do I stand before
I ask for Self-realisation?”

12:30.096 --> 12:33.920
The another thing about
Self-realisation is very important,

12:34.388 --> 12:39.289
specially in the Western
mind, which I must tell you –

12:39.489 --> 12:45.244
I say ‘Western’ because Eastern have not
yet gone to that end of rationality, that’s why –

12:46.244 --> 12:52.382
that one has to understand
that we are asking for Truth;

12:52.583 --> 12:55.241
and Truth is not going to fall at your feet.

12:56.098 --> 13:03.108
It is not a clinic opened out here

13:03.308 --> 13:06.252
where you have paid the money
and you go to the doctor and tell him,

13:06.452 --> 13:10.299
“Do I have fever despite
the fact you gave me medicine?”.

13:11.767 --> 13:15.105
And you report to him that, “What is this?

13:15.306 --> 13:20.800
I paid you ten pounds and nothing has
happened to me so far, what about my excuse?”

13:21.675 --> 13:27.576
You cannot demand from the Truth anything like that.
Now this is difficult for a Western mind to understand!

13:27.776 --> 13:30.072
To me also they treat in the same manner!

13:31.077 --> 13:36.402
While I’m just good at receiving something.

13:36.602 --> 13:40.687
So I must warn you,
nobody is going to fall at your feet

13:40.887 --> 13:47.108
or run after you that
you get your Self-realisation.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.913
That absolutely must be understood by all of you.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.296
You cannot purchase it.

13:55.368 --> 14:00.440
You cannot pay for it. You
cannot control it. You cannot ask for it.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.426
It is the grace which has to work it out,

14:03.645 --> 14:06.179
which human beings cannot understand, you see.

14:06.379 --> 14:11.184
We have never done like that, we have never
seen like that. Everything is a shopping with us.

14:11.946 --> 14:15.832
So our shopping style of
mind has to be changed a little.

14:17.303 --> 14:19.546
We are not shopping God.

14:20.411 --> 14:23.129
There is no shopping involved.

14:25.739 --> 14:32.472
Whenever I meet people
I find this attitude in them.

14:33.605 --> 14:40.004
As if you have gone to the
river Ganges to fill up your bucket

14:40.204 --> 14:46.919
and the bucket, instead of putting from the side
where there is the place for the water to enter in,

14:47.119 --> 14:49.245
you are putting from the other side.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.290
And then you say,
“How is it Mother I didn’t get it?

14:53.490 --> 14:55.469
There must be some fake about you”

14:55.670 --> 14:58.918
“Yes and there is. So please leave me alone”.

15:02.600 --> 15:08.174
It is difficult because we are used to pampering.

15:09.435 --> 15:12.378
Even doctors pamper you; they tell us lies.

15:12.959 --> 15:18.384
Even if there is nothing wrong, they give
medicinal water injection to say you are sick.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.885
Because they have to do their business!

15:22.269 --> 15:25.091
Everybody pampers you, tells lies.

15:26.045 --> 15:30.229
But here there’s no question.

15:32.707 --> 15:34.829
There’s no need,

15:38.829 --> 15:41.727
to be pampered.

15:42.454 --> 15:46.446
You must know that those who
pamper you, will never heal you.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.282
They are doing it because
they want to make money out of you.

15:49.482 --> 15:53.797
They want to befool you.
They want to take advantage of you.

15:57.497 --> 16:00.460
They will never tell you
the truth. Why should they?

16:01.138 --> 16:06.968
If they tell you the Truth you will never pay them
money because Truth cannot be purchased through money.

16:07.169 --> 16:09.171
They will never say this.

16:12.920 --> 16:18.010
They’ll pay attention to
your purse, to your position.

16:18.932 --> 16:25.702
They are not bothered as to say
that the human race has reached a stage

16:25.902 --> 16:30.775
where it has to jump, it has to breakthrough.

16:30.975 --> 16:34.539
It has to get into that collective consciousness.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.330
It has to become that. It’s an important thing.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.924
That is most important.

16:41.046 --> 16:47.320
They are very low people, but they appeal
to you because they appeal to your baser self.

16:48.614 --> 16:52.712
Even rationality is a baser
self in man, take it from me.

16:53.066 --> 16:56.319
Through rationality you can
do all kinds of baser things.

16:57.690 --> 17:04.689
Too much rationality can give you
ideas, how to plan, how to rob a bank.

17:05.212 --> 17:06.993
What perfect plan is this?

17:07.696 --> 17:11.783
How to rob a bank, how to kill a President,

17:11.984 --> 17:18.938
how to disturb somebody
who is doing something good.

17:19.138 --> 17:22.918
It’s a fact that they do this through rationality.

17:23.119 --> 17:31.623
And people wade through all that without feeling any
compunction of their conscience or anything – “So what?”

17:34.429 --> 17:40.626
So even rationality, if somebody appeals to
you for God, you should know you are misled.

17:42.133 --> 17:44.774
Because very nice to pamper your ego,

17:44.974 --> 17:50.858
“Oh, what an intelligent man! You know,
you are very intelligent!” – damned forever!

17:51.243 --> 17:55.041
“Oh, you are very well read!” – damned forever.

17:55.315 --> 17:59.345
Never believe it. You cannot
read the Truth in the books.

17:59.688 --> 18:05.751
You cannot understand God through your brains.
If you have such ideas, you cannot get to Him.

18:05.951 --> 18:11.524
How much was the
reading of our Lord Jesus Christ?

18:11.724 --> 18:16.963
How many professorships
He had? What school He went to?

18:17.163 --> 18:23.069
And all the saints of the world with him,
any one of them, how much did they study?

18:23.269 --> 18:27.306
So keep away your rationality,
outside there, just like your shoes!

18:28.846 --> 18:30.756
Be humble.

18:35.385 --> 18:37.850
This of course doesn’t appeal

18:38.051 --> 18:43.556
because rationality pampers the ego
and the ego is a big balloon, you see.

18:43.756 --> 18:48.394
You press it from one side
from the other side it comes again.

18:49.038 --> 18:52.610
But I am quite clever and I am a Mother.

18:53.617 --> 18:57.370
I am a Mother, so I know how get it down slowly.

18:58.728 --> 19:01.641
You are not your ego by any chance.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.416
You are neither your superego.

19:05.617 --> 19:07.775
You are joy.

19:09.408 --> 19:13.319
You are eternal. You
have lost it so please find it.

19:13.519 --> 19:18.519
And don’t dwell upon these out of date ideas.

19:22.487 --> 19:26.265
I pamper you, but on Reality,

19:30.129 --> 19:34.840
on Reality and not on something that is falsehood.

19:36.881 --> 19:41.981
You must have seen in the history
that whenever a great sage came

19:42.181 --> 19:45.051
a great incarnation came on this Earth,

19:45.475 --> 19:48.254
they could not talk to intellectual people.

19:49.001 --> 19:54.794
Kabirdas, again I would say, who was
a very outspoken fellow, very outspoken,

19:54.994 --> 19:58.428
he says, “Padhi, padhi pandita moorakha bhai,”

19:58.629 --> 20:02.668
meaning that, “By reading
the learned became damn fools!”

20:07.328 --> 20:14.121
And the Hindi poets, you see, even today,
criticise him that his language was very vulgar,

20:16.651 --> 20:21.721
was very rude; he was very a
crude person. They call him ‘satukari’.

20:22.653 --> 20:26.517
Whatever you may say but he said the Truth.

20:31.270 --> 20:36.996
And this is the big Himalayan
task for you, I can tell you this much.

20:37.274 --> 20:43.955
With all the rational people you have trying
to solve the problem. Everybody very ‘capable’.

20:44.670 --> 20:50.200
They will talk like this “I believe”. Now
what do you believe? What do you know?

20:52.011 --> 20:54.011
Big things, you know!

20:54.772 --> 21:01.027
“I believe that this should be done!”
Big things! Lectures! What do you know?

21:01.948 --> 21:07.203
Do you know that not even a leaf
can move by your beliefs and faiths

21:07.404 --> 21:12.118
and by your talking and
jabbering and breathing. Nothing! It is He.

21:12.383 --> 21:18.553
It is He who moves everything in this
world. It is He who manages, organises.

21:18.753 --> 21:24.138
It is He who looks after each and
everything, and it is He who has created you

21:24.338 --> 21:27.520
and He who has created this great Universe.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.657
It is not you or your, this, stupid rationality.

21:33.833 --> 21:37.476
Please try, please try to understand.

21:42.497 --> 21:46.933
Because I want you to find that which is joy,

21:48.170 --> 21:52.170
which is very beautiful, which is great.

21:54.646 --> 22:00.486
And the time has come, the
time has come. You will find it.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.045
The time has come.

22:03.245 --> 22:07.630
But in your freedom you have
developed such a big balloon in your heads!

22:09.007 --> 22:12.961
Rather difficult sometimes to take it down.

22:16.433 --> 22:21.407
And the Divine plays tricks
with such people, lots of tricks.

22:22.321 --> 22:26.612
And such people do not get what they want.

22:27.860 --> 22:34.086
You cannot ask God to get
crystallised in your own moulds!

22:35.977 --> 22:40.187
You have to accept Him as He is. Just as He is.

22:40.387 --> 22:42.859
You have to just say, “Lord, we can’t.

22:43.059 --> 22:48.805
Now, let us just enter into Your Kingdom.
Let us see for ourselves what is it like.”

22:49.006 --> 22:50.998
Come with an open mind.

22:51.199 --> 22:53.719
But you cannot just command that,

22:53.919 --> 22:59.430
“We know this is not the kingdom of God!” and, “That
is not the kingdom of God!” and, “This is not the Truth!”

22:59.631 --> 23:01.718
You see for yourself.

23:03.127 --> 23:06.786
Humble down! Have you found Him so far?

23:08.595 --> 23:16.936
The other day somebody came to me, he said
that, “I want to meet God I don’t want Self-realisation!” .

23:17.533 --> 23:21.333
As if they have voted for Him
and elected Him as their God!

23:22.120 --> 23:25.579
You want to meet God? Who are you?

23:25.985 --> 23:28.397
Very simple question I am asking.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.309
How do you demand?

23:32.818 --> 23:34.839
What have you done?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.117
Do you deserve Him?

23:37.318 --> 23:39.491
Why should God meet you?

23:42.974 --> 23:45.791
First of all you yourself must be clear,

23:45.991 --> 23:50.109
in that mirror only you can meet the God.

23:53.673 --> 23:56.715
“What I want” is not the point,

23:56.915 --> 24:00.105
because we have seen in the
BBC people go round on the streets

24:00.305 --> 24:04.103
and ask them questions, “Now, what do you say?
What do you have to say? What do you have to say?”

24:04.304 --> 24:08.968
It’s alright for political elections
or if you have to sell some materials.

24:09.169 --> 24:11.841
But for God your opinion does not matter.

24:12.042 --> 24:17.576
It is the opinion of God that
matters and not your opinion about Him.

24:20.642 --> 24:25.064
It is His grace, it is His
kindness, it is His compassion.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.334
It is His understanding about you which matters.

24:34.708 --> 24:40.779
And that is why, everywhere, whether
in religion, or in politics or anywhere,

24:40.979 --> 24:43.782
we are nowhere near Truth, nowhere near.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.696
You go to a church: Oh God! It’s a headache.

24:48.061 --> 24:53.482
We go to a temple: another headache. In
Indian temples these days they are selling hashish!

24:57.934 --> 25:00.734
And here in the church, that day I went,

25:00.935 --> 25:05.659
I found they were, all the girls and boys, were dressed
up to attract each other and that’s what they were doing!

25:05.859 --> 25:08.912
And nobody was interested in God or anything!

25:12.073 --> 25:17.650
As if they have gone to some
discotheque or some sort of a club there.

25:22.341 --> 25:25.491
So, this kind of attitude doesn’t help.

25:26.484 --> 25:30.997
It’s a very great thing to
achieve your Self-realisation, no doubt.

25:31.198 --> 25:35.734
It has been made easy because of modern times.

25:36.791 --> 25:41.858
It had to be, as you could
never go to the Sun or the moon,

25:42.058 --> 25:46.312
you could never think of moon, you
could never, even see what was on the Sun.

25:46.512 --> 25:52.217
Now you know what is happening to Sun,
you can reach the moon; you can land there.

25:52.417 --> 25:58.657
This has happened only last fifty years.
Everything has happened so quickly, dramatically!

25:59.063 --> 26:03.277
Fifty years back nobody
could even think of going to moon.

26:04.714 --> 26:10.112
And hence, Self-realisation has
become now an en-masse phenomenon.

26:10.347 --> 26:15.668
But it is not cheap.

26:15.868 --> 26:19.514
It is not vulgar. It is not sellable.

26:20.211 --> 26:24.211
It has its own dignity and its own protocol.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.888
The person who is proud of his rationality,

26:30.088 --> 26:33.625
or of his intellect, or of his wealth,

26:33.825 --> 26:38.964
let him stay where he is He
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

26:40.492 --> 26:47.906
The one who is proud of His
Father, the one who is proud of His God,

26:48.150 --> 26:54.580
and the one who knows that He
looks after us, every moment, every time,

26:56.642 --> 26:58.661
will be saved.

26:58.887 --> 27:01.653
My Grandmother used to tell me a story,

27:02.245 --> 27:08.804
that there is different talk of
religion and to be in religion.

27:09.847 --> 27:15.167
And then she told me a story of a
man she said that he believed in God,

27:15.806 --> 27:19.714
and that was the truth for him.

27:20.488 --> 27:22.491
That was his truth.

27:22.692 --> 27:28.447
So, one day, he found a man –
of course it’s a story – going to meet God.

27:29.137 --> 27:32.500
So he asked, “You are going to see God.

27:32.700 --> 27:36.987
Will you do me a favour?”
He said, “Yes, what can I do?”.

27:37.187 --> 27:42.428
He was lying just on the side of the road, one side
and he was saying, “You see, you go and tell God that,

27:42.628 --> 27:45.964
I am little hungry these days
You better arrange for my food.”

27:46.164 --> 27:49.034
He said, “What?” He said,
“You just go and tell him ”

27:51.178 --> 27:56.975
He said, “Look at this man! He is just
ordering God that he should give him food!”

27:58.131 --> 28:02.413
Then he went further on and through
the forest he was passing He saw one yogi,

28:02.613 --> 28:11.330
standing on his head with all his stomach inside,
all bones showing off and as if now going to collapse

28:12.164 --> 28:16.228
into a very frantic state of devotion.

28:16.656 --> 28:19.442
So he asked…

28:21.132 --> 28:23.869
That’s why you must have Realisation.

28:24.069 --> 28:30.556
Because then you start feeling the vibrations, you start
feeling the different centres, you start practising them.

28:30.756 --> 28:33.940
Then you settle down with
the Truth and you know it is the Truth.

28:34.141 --> 28:39.111
Then you forget you are a Westerner, Easterner, you
forget you are rational, you are emotional – nothing!

28:39.311 --> 28:44.356
You become a citizen of
God and a citizen of His Kingdom.

28:44.898 --> 28:47.893
Because you start enjoying the powers.

28:48.215 --> 28:52.131
And the power doesn’t
mean oppression, it means love:

28:52.331 --> 28:57.302
the enjoyment of love of God.
It doesn’t mean sex and the nonsense of that.

28:57.502 --> 29:04.409
It means the love of God, which
is so pure, a joy-giving and blissful,

29:06.506 --> 29:10.129
which makes you one with the Collective Being.

29:11.903 --> 29:18.157
But a person has to get out of his limited
sphere and limited ideas and limited things:

29:18.357 --> 29:22.995
that ideas he has formed about others
and about the surroundings and all that.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.752
Just that is all maya, is illusion!

29:27.278 --> 29:31.061
The Reality is only God
Almighty, the rest is all illusion.

29:31.262 --> 29:36.344
And you must know this illusion when it ends,
you are amazed that, “This illusion, how can it be?”

29:36.544 --> 29:40.078
How it works! It’s dynamic.

29:41.389 --> 29:47.853
Then you start enjoying the beauty
of His grace and you start seeing it.

29:48.054 --> 29:52.359
And you are amazed at
yourself that, you were this,

29:52.559 --> 29:55.460
so great and you are this,

29:56.915 --> 29:59.487
now that you have seen.

30:00.209 --> 30:03.502
I wish to all the new people
good luck. Let’s see how it works out.

30:03.908 --> 30:09.007
So, don't you get desperate [inaudible],
please take out your shoes if you don’t mind.

30:09.207 --> 30:12.477
You have to put your feet,
little bit to the Mother Earth also.

30:12.955 --> 30:17.115
She helps us. We are made of
Mother Earth, that element is within us.

30:17.315 --> 30:21.468
And I told one lady to take out her
shoes; she wouldn’t even take out her shoes!

30:21.909 --> 30:24.756
The another fellow says,
“I don’t believe in any rituals.”

30:24.956 --> 30:29.330
Now what is a ritual? I mean if you need
an operation, I need to move my hands or not?

30:31.703 --> 30:35.167
Isn’t it? I mean such
demanding people I tell you!

30:35.525 --> 30:41.002
One day somebody might come with a hunter in
his hand I think here, demanding for Self-realisation!

30:41.203 --> 30:43.703
“Are you going to give me or not?”.

30:44.544 --> 30:49.047
It is so funny sometimes! Ah so, How are you Anna?

30:49.247 --> 30:51.416
How are you aah?

31:06.016 --> 31:09.984
You must get Kabir some
time here, I am dying to see him.

31:10.737 --> 31:12.780
Yogini: I’ve brought a friend Mother.

31:12.980 --> 31:17.139
Shri Mataji: This lady?
She’s good. She’s very good.

31:18.290 --> 31:21.713
You have such sweet nice friends I must say.

31:22.064 --> 31:27.619
I mean, they say, “Birds of a
feather flock together,” in the same way.

31:36.570 --> 31:40.299
Anna is another beautiful
person, she’s a born-realised soul.

31:41.308 --> 31:45.264
And such people are really very
good. She was misled by someone

31:45.464 --> 31:48.607
but when I told her, she was a little
bit shocked, and then she was alright,

31:48.807 --> 31:53.512
because she’s a born-realised, she has
a much more power to understand the Truth.

31:54.211 --> 31:57.382
But even if you are not
doesn’t make any difference.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.219
You can make wonderful yourself.

32:03.947 --> 32:11.686
You need to know your own self. She has a son who is
very much dynamic, Kabir, he’s very wonderful and very wise.

32:11.887 --> 32:15.587
Now, should we? Have your hands like this.
