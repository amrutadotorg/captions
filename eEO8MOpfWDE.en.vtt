00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.523
﻿…Then what can rationality do?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.209
There must be some
reason for having rationality in us,

00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:14.014
why God has given us rationality,
He doesn’t waste his diamonds like that!

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:19.590
Rationality gives us the sense to understand,

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:23.248
that we cannot reach there through rationality

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.106
Because unless and until this thing
happens to you, you are not going to believe in it.

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:36.772
You are not going to believe in it that, this
rationality, on which we depend, which is our support,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:42.743
which is we; we all the time think that
our identification is complete with rationality.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:46.789
And we are very rational and
we are proud of our rationality also.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.725
So then, you reach a point, through rationality,

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:55.074
where you understand that this is not
the horse which will be useful any further.

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:58.759
This is the use of rationality!

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.078
One way it takes you to that culminating point

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:06.727
where you think it is to be
discarded or cannot be depended upon.

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:08.928
On the other side,

00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:17.712
rationality gives you a view.

00:01:18.372 --> 00:01:22.583
A view which can be related
later on, when you get the experience.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.022
You'll start understanding
why rationality was failing you.

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:33.427
So it’s a teacher on a negative way.

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.821
It’s a teacher on a negative way.

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:42.348
But it is essential because man was given freedom

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.397
and he started using his freedom,

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:49.743
he started using his rationality.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.717
When he reaches that point
then he starts depending on his wisdom.

00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:00.487
And wisdom is the balance,

00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:05.113
between his emotionality and rationality,

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:12.366
in the centre of it,
between his heart and his mind.

00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:18.071
It is a centre somewhere there,
in the central, or we say in the fulcrum.

00:02:19.444 --> 00:02:24.978
So if you are too much on the
emotionality, or too much on the rationality,

00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:30.150
you have to move further into
the centre and balance it at a point,

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.689
then only you are in wisdom,
and that’s how you rise within yourself.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:41.628
Any extreme behaviour, on the left or the
right, or dependance, is not going to help you.

00:02:44.103 --> 00:02:47.267
This you can understand through even emotionality.

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:50.470
A person who is very emotional (sometimes?):

00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:57.878
he sort of ‘loves’ someone, loves, you see;

00:02:58.498 --> 00:03:04.885
and he goes ahead with sincerity
after that love, and he gets into infatuation.

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:13.819
An then he realises, “Oh! This is
not joy. How could I failed?”

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.394
So he says, “I have a broken heart ”.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:24.486
It’s better that he realises
that. So he turns to his head.

00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:30.415
But he turns to his head, his head to such an
extreme that he gives up his broken heart completely.

00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:35.903
It is in the centre, in the centre of your heart

00:03:36.103 --> 00:03:40.375
and your brain, lies this fulcrum point.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.936
Rationality and emotionality

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.764
are two extremes, but in the centre of it.

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.769
So wisdom is an abstract word. What is wisdom?

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.725
You ask somebody, “Is it wisdom?”

00:03:58.926 --> 00:04:01.589
“This is wisdom? That is wisdom?”

00:04:02.334 --> 00:04:07.214
Then how do you understand the wisdom? By
discarding, by saying, “No, this is not wisdom,”

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:11.018
“This is not wisdom,” “This cannot be wisdom ”.

00:04:11.296 --> 00:04:14.121
Here you use both your emotionality

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.791
and your rationality, when
you start deciding that this is.

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:22.415
That’s why I said these are negative teachers:

00:04:23.707 --> 00:04:26.616
in the sense that they
drive you towards positivity.

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:29.739
In the sense that they
drive you towards the Reality.

00:04:30.818 --> 00:04:35.275
They teach you that this is not the correct.

00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:38.630
Take any one of your,

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:45.131
say ‘political enterprises’, as I would call
them, ‘political institutions’ as you call them:

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:52.359
take communism, take capitalism, take all
these sorts of isms that you have all around.

00:04:52.807 --> 00:04:58.545
All experiments, all your political experiments,
which you have found through your rational approaches –

00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:00.905
they cannot give you a solution.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.775
Democracy fails, communism also fails.

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.700
Any other monarchy fails. In the
same way demonocracy also fails.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.280
Everything fails! Then you realise that,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.891
“Is there any truth in
going through these things?”

00:05:25.954 --> 00:05:29.529
“Is this the way we are going to reach anywhere?”

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.899
Then you start understanding,

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:38.772
“That, no, no. We all have
made some mistakes somewhere ”.

00:05:39.183 --> 00:05:43.458
But this is not possible for
people who are running the race

00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:46.354
who are running the race it is not possible.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:49.716
For example, I cannot talk
to bureaucrats – impossible –

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:53.887
because they are holding,
they are carrying the bags.

00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:58.810
So, some are democratic some are
communistic, I don’t know what sort of whims they have.

00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:01.693
So these big Johnnies
are not going to listen to us.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:07.683
No, they cannot! Because
for them that is identified.

00:06:07.884 --> 00:06:13.980
To them that, what they call,
is a ‘perfect’ political institution,

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:17.950
is the goal of life,
and everybody must come to it!

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:27.621
That’s why, when these different
ideologies and different isms start flowering,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.478
you find that they have not yet reached
any flowering

00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:36.730
and they just shrivel up,
they lose their existence,

00:06:37.582 --> 00:06:41.501
because rationality doesn’t
give you that complete picture.

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:51.549
It doesn’t give you the complete
idea as to how far man can progress,

00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:56.700
with rationality

00:06:56.901 --> 00:07:00.787
and how far he is going to achieve the result.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:05.592
What is the result?
What do we expect? Is to have joy.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.634
But any democracies or any
communistic countries or any despotic countries,

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:21.254
anywhere you go, you will find the people
have no joy; they have forgotten how to even smile!

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:26.789
You have to give them an
injection to make them laugh!

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:33.987
So, this rationality gives us an understanding,

00:07:34.346 --> 00:07:41.193
that all our endeavours or all our enterprises
which have been brought forth through rationality,

00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.297
are not fulfilling.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.162
They show something
but finish off, wither away.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.640
Same with our emotionality like we have,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.590
we have ‘faith’ in God.

00:07:58.422 --> 00:08:04.206
You have faith in God, so anybody who
says, “I am God” people run after such a person.

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:07.087
There are many who are crazy like that!

00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:10.357
The other day only, I was watching a TV show

00:08:10.557 --> 00:08:15.228
where they showed a man who said,
“I am Christ” and he was a follower of Hitler.

00:08:15.842 --> 00:08:21.468
And he was killing people and he was doing
all kinds of things and he had a big following!

00:08:22.454 --> 00:08:28.108
And the people were crying and
weeping for him when he was facing his trial.

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:31.611
One cannot explain these
things, how these things happen.

00:08:32.264 --> 00:08:35.548
How can God be that poorly?

00:08:36.312 --> 00:08:40.654
And how could people who
are talking about God could be like that?

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:44.157
Because they play on
the emotionality of the people.

00:08:45.787 --> 00:08:49.671
They think, “Oh I feel very fine” “I have
seen many good people who come here,”

00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:54.935
“Oh I feel very fine in his company, that
guru met me,” “Oh I feel very happy here!”

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:59.847
What did he do? How do you feel
fine? What does it appeal to you?

00:09:00.047 --> 00:09:05.879
It is such a subtle type
of diversion from the Reality.

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:10.583
It’s such a subtle type,
that you cannot even make out.

00:09:11.366 --> 00:09:14.955
Specially rational people
cannot, they are befooled the first!

00:09:15.861 --> 00:09:22.128
The so called ego-oriented people
are befooled the first with emotionality.

00:09:22.477 --> 00:09:25.003
To them anybody who comes with emotions, you know –

00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:31.899
stands up with very big emotions and
tears in the eyes and shouts at the loud speaker

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.492
and as if he is just going to die with the pangs,

00:09:36.692 --> 00:09:40.246
or something like that  – appeals so much.

00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:45.921
Because that’s the balance for
their rational minds, that they fall a trap.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:52.492
So this kind of a emotionality also
can go to another extreme of madness!

00:09:53.586 --> 00:09:56.829
Like you have seen people
singing songs of separation with God.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.075
It sickens me sometimes the way, you know?

00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:02.602
It’s sickening! I don’t know how people like it.

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:05.671
The other day we had that musician who came to me,

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:08.012
so I said, “You sing me a song”,

00:10:08.213 --> 00:10:10.662
He said “What type of
song, Mother, You want to hear?”

00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:13.875
I said, “Sing us some song of joy”

00:10:14.076 --> 00:10:16.344
“Song of joy?” He was lost!

00:10:16.545 --> 00:10:22.168
He said, “They have produced no song of joy for
the last twenty years in this country anywhere!”

00:10:22.369 --> 00:10:26.726
None of them in the English
society or the Western people.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.668
I said, “No song of joy?”

00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:36.251
He picked up something somewhere, and
which also had a string of crying and weeping in it.

00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:40.817
I said, “Now there is no absolute joy anywhere!”

00:10:44.817 --> 00:10:48.436
Just think of it!
The emotionality has reached to such an extent

00:10:48.637 --> 00:10:51.626
that you have lost all praise of joy, completely.

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:56.986
So, you cannot depend on that
kind of an emotionality that –

00:10:57.186 --> 00:11:00.523
in the church, you go and
somebody stands on the pulpit and says,

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:08.635
“Oh, I am like that!” with all the vibrating
sounds and all that drama of emotionality.

00:11:08.985 --> 00:11:12.439
And you say “Oh!
What a thing! Oh I was very happy!”

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:22.015
If such a thing is accepted in
life, I can tell you, be rest assured,

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:25.952
that when such a thing appeals to you,

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:30.523
you must know that you
are not facing the Reality at all.

00:11:31.609 --> 00:11:34.311
You are not prepared to face the Reality.

00:11:34.511 --> 00:11:38.244
You do not want to face it!
You might give any excuse about it.

00:11:38.444 --> 00:11:43.860
You like to identify yourself as,
“Oh, I am too much of a rational person,

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.942
I am too rational, I cannot accept
this. This is beyond me, I just can’t!”

00:11:49.412 --> 00:11:52.690
Or you may even say, “I am
English, bit too English I cannot accept it!”

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:57.584
Or somebody may say that, “I am too much of
an Indian, I cannot accept this kind of a thing ”.

00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:03.123
But when you say you are an
Indian, first of all, you are misidentifying.

00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:07.598
and secondly you are misidentifying
with one extreme or the other extreme.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.299
So before starting about your seeking,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.316
you have to understand yourself
– which extreme you are standing.

00:12:18.549 --> 00:12:20.560
Very important.

00:12:21.048 --> 00:12:23.877
Very important it is to understand this part,

00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:29.115
“Where do I stand before
I ask for Self-realisation?”

00:12:30.096 --> 00:12:33.920
The another thing about
Self-realisation is very important,

00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:39.289
specially in the Western
mind, which I must tell you –

00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:45.244
I say ‘Western’ because Eastern have not
yet gone to that end of rationality, that’s why –

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:52.382
that one has to understand
that we are asking for Truth;

00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:55.241
and Truth is not going to fall at your feet.

00:12:56.098 --> 00:13:03.108
It is not a clinic opened out here

00:13:03.308 --> 00:13:06.252
where you have paid the money
and you go to the doctor and tell him,

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:10.299
“You - I have fever despite
the fact you gave me medicine.”

00:13:11.767 --> 00:13:15.105
And you report to him that, “What is this?

00:13:15.306 --> 00:13:20.800
I paid you ten pounds and nothing has
happened to me so far, what about my health?”

00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:27.576
You cannot demand from the Truth anything like that.
Now this is difficult for a Western mind to understand!

00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:30.072
To me also they treat in the same manner!

00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:36.402
While I’m not good at receiving something.

00:13:36.602 --> 00:13:40.687
So I must warn you,
nobody is going to fall at your feet

00:13:40.887 --> 00:13:47.108
or run after you that
you get your Self-realisation.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.913
That absolutely must be understood by all of you.

00:13:52.199 --> 00:13:54.296
You cannot purchase it.

00:13:55.368 --> 00:14:00.440
You cannot pay for it. You
cannot control it. You cannot ask for it.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.426
It is the grace which has to work it out,

00:14:03.645 --> 00:14:06.179
which human beings cannot understand, you see.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:11.184
We have never done like that, we have never
seen like that. Everything is a shopping with us.

00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:15.832
So our shopping style of
mind has to be changed a little.

00:14:17.303 --> 00:14:19.546
We are not shopping God.

00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:23.129
There is no shopping involved here.

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:32.472
Whenever I meet people
I find this attitude in them.

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:40.004
As if you have gone to the
river Ganges to fill the bucket

00:14:40.204 --> 00:14:46.919
and the bucket, instead of putting from the side
where there is the place for the water to enter in,

00:14:47.119 --> 00:14:49.245
you are putting from the other side.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.290
And then you say,
“How is it Mother I didn’t get it?

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.469
There must be some fake about you”

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.918
“Yes and there is. So please leave me alone”.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.174
It is difficult because we are used to pampering.

00:15:09.435 --> 00:15:12.378
Even doctors pamper you; they tell us lies.

00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:18.384
Even if there is nothing wrong, they'll give
medicinal water injection to say you are sick.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.885
Because they have to do their business!

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:25.091
Everybody pampers you, tells lies.

00:15:26.045 --> 00:15:30.229
But here there’s no question.

00:15:32.707 --> 00:15:34.829
There’s no need,

00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:41.727
to be pampered.

00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:46.446
You must know that those who
pamper you, will never heal you.

00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:49.282
They are doing it because
they want to make money out of you.

00:15:49.482 --> 00:15:53.797
They want to befool you.
They want to take advantage of you.

00:15:57.497 --> 00:16:00.460
They will never tell you
the truth. Why should they?

00:16:01.138 --> 00:16:06.968
If they tell you the Truth you will never pay them
money because Truth cannot be purchased through money.

00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:09.171
They will never say this.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:18.010
They’ll pay attention to
your purse, to your position.

00:16:18.932 --> 00:16:25.702
They are not bothered as to say
that the human race has reached a stage

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:30.775
where it has to jump, it has to breakthrough.

00:16:30.975 --> 00:16:34.539
It has to get into that collective consciousness.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.330
It has to become that. It’s an important thing.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.924
That is the most important.

00:16:41.046 --> 00:16:47.320
They are very low people, but they appeal
to you because they appeal to your baser self.

00:16:48.614 --> 00:16:52.712
Even rationality is a baser
self in man, take it from me.

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:56.319
Through rationality you can
do all kinds of baser things.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:04.689
Too much rationality can give you
ideas, how to plan, how to rob a bank.

00:17:05.212 --> 00:17:06.993
What perfect plan is this?

00:17:07.696 --> 00:17:11.783
How to rob a bank, how to kill a President,

00:17:11.984 --> 00:17:18.938
how to disturb somebody
who is doing something good.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:22.918
It’s a fact that they do this through rationality.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:31.623
And people wade through all that without feeling any
compunction of their conscience or anything – “So what?”

00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:40.626
So even rationality, if somebody appeals to
you for God, you should know you are misled.

00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:44.774
Because very nice to pamper your ego by saying,

00:17:44.974 --> 00:17:50.858
“Oh, what an intelligent man! You know,
you are very intelligent!” – damned forever!

00:17:51.243 --> 00:17:55.041
“Oh, you are very well read!” – damned forever.

00:17:55.315 --> 00:17:59.345
Never believe it. You cannot
read the Truth in the books.

00:17:59.688 --> 00:18:05.751
You cannot understand God through your brains.
If you have such ideas, you cannot get to Him.

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:11.524
How much was the
reading of our Lord Jesus Christ?

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:16.963
How many professorships
He had? What school He went to?

00:18:17.163 --> 00:18:23.069
And all the saints of the world with him,
any one of them, how much did they study?

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:27.306
So keep away your rationality,
outside there, just like your shoes!

00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:30.756
Be humble.

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:37.850
This of course doesn’t appeal

00:18:38.051 --> 00:18:43.556
because rationality pampers the ego
and the ego is a big balloon, you see.

00:18:43.756 --> 00:18:48.394
You press it from one side
from the other side it comes to attack.

00:18:49.038 --> 00:18:52.610
But I am quite clever and I am a Mother.

00:18:53.617 --> 00:18:57.370
I am a Mother, so I know how get it down slowly.

00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:01.641
You are not your ego by any chance.

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:05.416
You are neither your superego.

00:19:05.617 --> 00:19:07.775
You are joy.

00:19:09.408 --> 00:19:13.319
You are eternal. You
have lost it so please find it.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:18.519
And don’t dwell upon these out of date ideas.

00:19:22.487 --> 00:19:26.265
I pamper you, but on Reality,

00:19:30.129 --> 00:19:34.840
on Reality and not on something that is falsehood.

00:19:36.881 --> 00:19:41.981
You must have seen in the history
that whenever a great sage came

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.051
a great incarnation came on this Earth,

00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:48.254
they could not talk to intellectual people.

00:19:49.001 --> 00:19:54.794
Kabirdas, again I would say, who was
a very outspoken fellow, very outspoken,

00:19:54.994 --> 00:19:58.428
he says, “Padhi, padhi pandita moorakha bhai,”

00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:02.668
meaning that, “By reading
the learned became damn fools!”

00:20:07.328 --> 00:20:14.121
And the Hindi poets, you see, even today,
criticise him that his language was very vulgar,

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:21.721
was very rude; he was very a
crude person. They call him ‘Sadhukkadi’.

00:20:22.653 --> 00:20:26.517
Whatever you may say but he said the Truth.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.996
And this is the big Himalayan
task for you, I can tell you this much.

00:20:37.274 --> 00:20:43.955
With all the rational people you are trying
to solve the problem. Everybody very ‘capable’.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:50.200
They will talk like this “I believe”. Now
what do you believe? What do you know?

00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:54.011
Big things, you know!

00:20:54.772 --> 00:21:01.027
“I believe that this should be done!”
Big things! Lectures! What do you know?

00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:07.203
Do you know that not even a leaf
can move by your beliefs and faiths

00:21:07.404 --> 00:21:12.118
and by your talking and
jabbering and thinking? Nothing! It is He.

00:21:12.383 --> 00:21:18.553
It is He who moves everything in this
world. It is He who manages, organises.

00:21:18.753 --> 00:21:24.138
It is He who looks after each and
everything, and it is He who has created you

00:21:24.338 --> 00:21:27.520
and He who has created this great Universe.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.657
It is not you or your, this, stupid rationality.

00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:37.476
Please try, please try to understand.

00:21:42.497 --> 00:21:46.933
Because I want you to find that which is joy,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.170
which is beautiful, which is great.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:22:00.486
And the time has come, the
time has come. You will find it.

00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:03.045
The time has come.

00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:07.630
But in your freedom you have
developed such a big balloon in your heads!

00:22:09.007 --> 00:22:12.961
Rather difficult sometimes to take it round for Divine.

00:22:16.433 --> 00:22:21.407
And the Divine plays tricks
with such people, lots of tricks.

00:22:22.321 --> 00:22:26.612
And such people do not get what they want.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:34.086
You cannot ask God to get
crystallised in your own moulds!

00:22:35.977 --> 00:22:40.187
You have to accept Him as He is. Just as He is.

00:22:40.387 --> 00:22:42.859
You have to just say, “Lord, we can’t.

00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:48.805
Now, let us enter into Your Kingdom.
Let us see for ourselves what it is like.”

00:22:49.006 --> 00:22:50.998
Come with an open mind.

00:22:51.199 --> 00:22:53.719
But you cannot just command that,

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:59.430
“We know this is not the kingdom of God!” and, “That
is not the kingdom of God!” and, “This is not the Truth!”

00:22:59.631 --> 00:23:01.718
You see for yourself.

00:23:03.127 --> 00:23:06.786
Humble down! Have you found Him so far?

00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:16.936
The other day somebody came to me, he said
that, “I want to meet God I don’t want Self-realisation!” .

00:23:17.533 --> 00:23:21.333
As if they have voted for Him
and elected Him as their God!

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.579
You want to meet God? Who are you?

00:23:25.985 --> 00:23:28.397
I mean, simple question I am asking.

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:32.309
How do you demand?

00:23:32.818 --> 00:23:34.839
What have you done?

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.117
Do you deserve Him?

00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:39.491
Why should God meet you?

00:23:42.974 --> 00:23:45.791
First of all you yourself must be clear,

00:23:45.991 --> 00:23:50.109
in that mirror only you can see the God Almighty.

00:23:53.673 --> 00:23:56.715
“What I want” is not the point,

00:23:56.915 --> 00:24:00.105
because you have seen in the
BBC people go round on the streets

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:04.103
and ask them questions, “Now, what do you say?
What do you have to say? What do you have to say?”

00:24:04.304 --> 00:24:08.968
It’s alright for political elections
or if you have to sell some materials.

00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:11.841
But for God your opinion does not matter.

00:24:12.042 --> 00:24:17.576
It is the opinion of God that
matters and not your opinion about Him.

00:24:20.642 --> 00:24:25.064
It is His grace, it is His
kindness, it is His compassion,

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:28.334
it is His understanding about you which works.

00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:40.779
And that is why, everywhere, whether
in religion, or in politics or anywhere,

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:43.782
we are nowhere near Truth, nowhere near.

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:47.696
You go to a church: Oh God! It’s a headache.

00:24:48.061 --> 00:24:53.482
You go to a temple: another headache. In
Indian temples these days they are selling hashish!

00:24:57.934 --> 00:25:00.734
And here in the church, that day I went,

00:25:00.935 --> 00:25:05.659
I found there were - all the girls and boys, were dressed
up to attract each other and that’s what they were doing!

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:08.912
And nobody was interested in God or anything!

00:25:12.073 --> 00:25:17.650
As if they have gone to some
discotheque or some sort of a club there.

00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:25.491
So, this kind of attitude doesn’t help.

00:25:26.484 --> 00:25:30.997
It’s a very great thing to
achieve your Self-realisation, no doubt.

00:25:31.198 --> 00:25:35.734
It has been made easy because of modern times.

00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:41.858
It had to be, as you could
never go to the Sun or the moon,

00:25:42.058 --> 00:25:46.312
you could never think of moon, you
could never, even see what was on the Sun.

00:25:46.512 --> 00:25:52.217
Now you know what is happening to Sun,
you can reach the moon; you can land there.

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:58.657
This has happened only last fifty years.
Everything has happened so quickly, dramatically!

00:25:59.063 --> 00:26:03.277
Fifty years back nobody
could even think of going to moon.

00:26:04.714 --> 00:26:10.112
And hence, Self-realisation has
become now an en-masse phenomenon.

00:26:10.347 --> 00:26:15.668
But it is not cheap.

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:19.514
It is not vulgar. It is not selling.

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:24.211
It has its own dignity and its own protocol.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.888
The person who is proud of his rationality,

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:33.625
or of his intellect, or of his wealth,

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:38.964
let him stay where he is He
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:26:40.492 --> 00:26:47.906
The one who is proud of His
Father, the one who is proud of His God,

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:54.580
and the one who knows that He
looks after us, every moment, every time,

00:26:56.642 --> 00:26:58.661
will be saved.

00:26:58.887 --> 00:27:01.653
My Grandmother used to tell me a story,

00:27:02.245 --> 00:27:08.804
that there is different talk of
religion and to be in religion.

00:27:09.847 --> 00:27:15.167
And then she told me a story of a
man she said that he believed in God,

00:27:15.806 --> 00:27:19.714
and that was the truth for him.

00:27:20.488 --> 00:27:22.491
That was his truth.

00:27:22.692 --> 00:27:28.447
So, one day, he found a man –
of course it’s a story – going to meet God.

00:27:29.137 --> 00:27:32.500
So he asked, “You are going to see God.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.987
Will you do me a favour?”
He said, “Yes, what can I do?”.

00:27:37.187 --> 00:27:42.428
He was lying just on the side of the road, one side
and he was saying, “You see, you go and tell God that,

00:27:42.628 --> 00:27:45.964
I am little hungry these days
You better arrange for my food.”

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:49.034
He said, “What?” He said,
“You just go and tell him ”

00:27:51.178 --> 00:27:56.975
He said, “Look at this man! He is just
ordering God that he should give him food!”

00:27:58.131 --> 00:28:02.413
Then he went further on and through
the forest he was passing He saw one yogi,

00:28:02.613 --> 00:28:11.330
standing on his head with all his stomach inside,
all bones showing off and as if now going to collapse

00:28:12.164 --> 00:28:16.228
into a very frantic state of devotion.

00:28:16.656 --> 00:28:19.442
So he asked…

00:28:21.132 --> 00:28:23.869
That’s why you must have Realisation.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:30.556
Because then you start feeling the vibrations, you start
feeling the different centres, you start practising them.

00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:33.940
Then you settle down with
the Truth and you know it is the Truth.

00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:39.111
Then you forget you are a Westerner, Easterner, you
forget you are rational, you are emotional – nothing!

00:28:39.311 --> 00:28:44.356
You become a citizen of
God and a citizen of His Kingdom.

00:28:44.898 --> 00:28:47.893
Because you start enjoying the powers.

00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:52.131
And the power doesn’t
mean oppression, it means love:

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:57.302
the enjoyment of love of God.
It doesn’t mean sex and the nonsense of that.

00:28:57.502 --> 00:29:04.409
It means the love of God, which
is so pure, a joy-giving and blissful,

00:29:06.506 --> 00:29:10.129
which makes you one with the Collective Being.

00:29:11.903 --> 00:29:18.157
But a person has to get out of his limited
sphere and limited ideas and limited things:

00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:22.995
that ideas he has formed about others
and about the surroundings and all that.

00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:26.752
Just that is all maya, is illusion!

00:29:27.278 --> 00:29:31.061
The Reality is only God
Almighty, the rest is all illusion.

00:29:31.262 --> 00:29:36.344
And you must know this illusion when it ends,
you are amazed that, “This illusion, how can it be?”

00:29:36.544 --> 00:29:40.078
How it works! It’s dynamic.

00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:47.853
Then you start enjoying the beauty
of His grace and you start seeing it.

00:29:48.054 --> 00:29:52.359
And you are amazed at
yourself that, you were this,

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.460
so great and you are this,

00:29:56.915 --> 00:29:59.487
now that you have seen.

00:30:00.209 --> 00:30:03.502
I wish to all the new people
good luck. Let’s see how it works out.

00:30:03.908 --> 00:30:09.007
Don't you get desperate, no, about yourself, so
please take out your shoes if you don’t mind.

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:12.477
You have to put your feet,
little bit to the Mother Earth also.

00:30:12.955 --> 00:30:17.115
She helps us. We are made of
Mother Earth, that element is within us.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:21.468
And I told one lady to take out her
shoes; she wouldn’t even take out her shoes!

00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:24.756
The another fellow says,
“I don’t believe in any rituals.”

00:30:24.956 --> 00:30:29.330
Now what is a ritual? I mean if you need
an operation, I have to move my hands or not?

00:30:31.703 --> 00:30:35.167
Isn’t it? I mean such
demanding people I tell you!

00:30:35.525 --> 00:30:41.002
One day somebody might come with a hunter in
his hand I think here, demanding for Self-realisation!

00:30:41.203 --> 00:30:43.703
“Are you going to give me or not?”.

00:30:44.544 --> 00:30:49.047
It is so funny sometimes! Ah so, How are you Anna?

00:30:49.247 --> 00:30:51.416
How are you aah?

00:31:06.016 --> 00:31:09.984
You must get Kabir some
time here, I am dying to see him.

00:31:10.737 --> 00:31:12.780
Yogini: I’ve brought a friend Mother.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.139
Shri Mataji: This lady?
She’s good. She’s very good.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.713
You have such sweet nice friends I must say.

00:31:22.064 --> 00:31:27.619
I mean, you see, I think they say, “Birds of a
feather flock together,” in the same way.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:40.299
Anna is another very beautiful
person, she’s a born-realised soul.

00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:45.264
And such people are really very
good. She was misled by someone

00:31:45.464 --> 00:31:48.607
but when I told her, she was a little
bit shocked, and then she was alright,

00:31:48.807 --> 00:31:53.512
because she’s a born-realised, she has
a much more power to understand the Truth.

00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:57.382
But even if you are not
doesn’t make any difference.

00:31:58.217 --> 00:32:01.219
You can make wonderful yourself.

00:32:03.947 --> 00:32:11.686
You need to know your own self. She has a son who is
very much dynamic, Kabir, he’s very wonderful and very wise.

00:32:11.887 --> 00:32:15.587
Now, should we? Have your hands like this.
