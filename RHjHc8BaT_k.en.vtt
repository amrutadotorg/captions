00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.320
The chakras, the energy centers

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.880
which are inside each and all of us.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.160
Perhaps for new people I can give a very

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.880
quick summary of what was said then, and then go on.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.640
Shri Mataji will be here quite soon.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.000
You are here because there is a desire

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.680
to see, to understand, to know, to be with

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.600
something more than the day to day.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.720
Some sort of reality, some sort of truth, some sort of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
explanation,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.000
some sort of all embracing

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.200
idea, concept, vision,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.480
which places creation into a context,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.320
somewhere there.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.240
That seeking has taken us in many directions.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.160
Some of us to

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.160
false and damaging teachers,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.960
some to drugs,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.200
some to opting out,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.720
but

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.480
so, it’s led everybody else of course everybody here tonight

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.480
to this particular function.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.240
Shri Mataji is offering an experience.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.080
It's not self-certification, it's not like being

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.160
born again, I am born again, I am born again.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.120
It's not a statement of belief,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.600
it is an actual physical happening.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.400
And that physical happening is known as Self-realization.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.360
It's known as the Ruh to the Muslims,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.200
it's known as the Moksha to the Hindus,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.480
is known as enlightenment, liberation,

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800
second birth.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.600
There are a number of names for it.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.360
Christ referred to it as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.880
But it is all the same thing, it is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.760
this experience which links the energy within us

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.320
to the all pervading energy of God.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.120
The yoga, yoga means union,

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.200
and that union is in fact this,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.920
the union of this energy here

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.600
which lies in the sacrum bone at the bottom of the spine,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.720
is a physical thing, which in the presence of an authorised person

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.280
rises through the central channel

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.400
and piercing the top of the head, the fontanel bone,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.240
actually comes from the top of the head as a cool breeze.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.320
It also manifests on the hands as cool vibrations.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.920
And another thing that happens then is,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.880
that this, these cool vibrations

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.680
and this experience, makes one collectively conscious.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.280
It is a new step, it is another step in evolution.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.440
It is, perhaps to put it one way, a move from

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.200
the human being to a spiritual being.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.920
Now what happens when this,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.080
the Kundalini, this energy at the bottom of the spine rises?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.640
It pierces a number of energy centers in the body.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.320
Before we go on, looks we are going to have more people

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.320
here than seats.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.040
Is it possible -

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.360
how are those seats linked together? Are they separate?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.320
I am just wondering if there is any possibility of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.880
perhaps just easing the seats back and anybody who

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.680
would like to come forward and sit on the floor here.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.480
They are all linked.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.000
Is there any chance of just easing the seats back,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.520
is that practical? Just to give us a little more space here ine front.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.400
The desire for creation came,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.600
which is represented here by this left channel.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.200
Then, what we with the Christian background know

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.120
as the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.920
then became the force, that force of God

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.120
which brought about creation.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.720
And creation is two parts, or two parts of it,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.640
two aspects of it I should say. One is the desire

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.720
and the other is the creation itself.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.320
So we have two

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.400
channels, on the left and the right.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.240
One on the left and one on the right.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.040
The left hand one is concerned with

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.240
yesterday, the past, the female aspect in us,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.840
the emotional,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.560
that sense of desire, introspection.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.040
The right hand side is action.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.560
That is tomorrow, that is

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.640
planning, that is organising, that is dominating,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.000
that is being an outgoing personality,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.440
that is putting the attention out all the time.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.480
Taken to an extreme in the left

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.400
there is a tendency or extending the left rather,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.160
one comes into the subconscious.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.760
Everything that has happened in the past is here.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.120
It is possible further one comes to the left

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.960
the more one comes involved in the past.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.680
And it is possible on the right hand side

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.800
for this to go further and further into the right,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.920
and so it becomes fanatical, dry

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.240
and that's the area of heart attacks and

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.600
those overactive diseases which are so prevalent in the West.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.800
The West tends to be very active.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.080
The Eastern countries tend to be more on the left.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.800
Well, we talk about left and right, what does that mean?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.560
I was pointing out the other night that if we say something,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.120
"Oh I wish I hadn't said that to somebody,” now that's on the left,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.880
"Oh I wish I hadn't said that.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.920
Tomorrow when I see him again I will say this to him,”

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.200
that's on the right.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.520
So we have gone, "Oh gee I am sorry",

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.440
and we have come over to the right for tomorrow I will do this.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.280
At the point of crossing there is this little moment

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.040
right in the center and that is 'now',

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.080
when crossed from the past

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.200
from the past to the future,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.360
there is a crossing point which is 'now'.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.760
And that crossing point is this central channel

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.160
that the Kundalini, this energy,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.320
rises up in the process of Self-realization.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.640
Rising - this Mooladhara sits actually below,

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.440
the energy center sits below the source of the Kundalini,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.880
where the Kundalini originates in the sacrum bone.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.320
The first one up mentioned -

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.320
the next one is the Nabhi, the green one.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.880
Nabhi is concerned with our sustenance. In other words

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.160
we are not, if you like to think of it in terms of evolution

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.760
the Mooladhara is concerned with that innocence

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.880
that original innocence.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.600
Then comes the consciousness,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.880
the need for food, for shelter, those basic needs,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.480
that is the territory of the Nabhi.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.120
That is also the area of our evolution.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.520
The next chakra is the Swadhistan,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.720
coming back, and why it's the second chakra,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.760
because the Swadhistan circles around the Nabhi.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.040
Swadhistan is concerned with,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.400
the Swadhistan is concerned with

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.480
those aspects of creativity, the need to do something.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.400
Have we got any seats down here?

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.440
Yes

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.280
Well I think we have still quite a lot of room down here,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.840
if anybody would like to come forward and

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.360
and.. and sit.. and clear some seats.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.640
Are you happy standing there at the back?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.240
Here is still quite a bit of sitting room at the front here.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.760
So, again quickly going through these,-

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.400
the Swadhistan on the left is concerned

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.720
with truth, aspects of truth

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.200
and understanding when - what happens

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:27.200
prior to realization is that these centers

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.040
as we become involved in various activities, day to day activities,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.760
and they become damaged, they pick up

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.120
aspects of perhaps unrighteousness or

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.160
those adharmic things settle on to the chakras

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.880
and this is what Self-realization itself starts to clear.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.280
In other words, Self-realization starts to cleanse the chakras.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.840
It starts to mend the damages.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.680
It starts to solve the problems.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.640
So from the wisdom in Mooladhara

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.400
it comes to sense of evolution and sustenance in the Nabhi,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.400
creativity here in the Swadhistan

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.080
and then there is this green circle which is

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.400
called various things,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.040
the 'sea of illusion' it is frequently and poetically referred to.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:27.080
It is that area which must be crossed

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.760
if we are to make the transition between the material world

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.320
and the spiritual world.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.640
And we have all sorts of guides there like Moses and Abraham

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.640
and Lao Tzu and Confucius

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.240
and - and I think -

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.160
Here is Shri Mataji now!

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.960
Say a few words, you say first a few words then only I talk.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.400
Good evening ladies and gentleman.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.760
It's wonderful to see a capacity crowd here, I think that

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.280
Adelaide deserves the blessings of Shri Mataji and

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.040
tonight they are going to get it.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.160
So many people came the other night on Saturday and

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.840
gained their Self-realization, they followed it up with

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.120
a beautiful workshop program on Sunday, and

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.440
many people are busily working it out.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.240
It's a growing process, and

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.280
Sahaja Yoga is spreading very very strongly.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.720
You see all of us have to attain that fulfilment

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.720
that we've been seeking for so many lives.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.240
That fulfilment that is known in the scriptures

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.000
to the Christian as

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.120
being born again some people call it Self-realization.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.320
In the Hindu philosophy it's called Atma Sakshat, Self-realization.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.720
In the Mohammeden scriptures it's becoming a peer,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.440
when they begin to feel this cool wind of the Holy Spirit,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.840
they begin to feel it in their awareness

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.440
consciously on their hands and

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.720
coming from the top of their head,

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.240
feel it as vibrations of the unconscious.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.680
And this vibration that they feel

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.280
is the verification and the manifestation that they have

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.160
at last made that connection with the unconscious.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.920
This is the result and the reward of

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:36.800
so many lives when they have been seeking God.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.160
And so many people here tonight are in that category.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.680
There are so many negative forces which have been trying to stop us.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.520
So much confusion in this age of darkness which is known,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.480
and has been known as the Kali Yuga.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.160
So much confusion and frustration of modern living in which

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.000
people begin to wonder which way to turn,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.440
who is truth and who is falsehood,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.880
who is the real teacher,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.240
who is the false teacher.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.280
Shri Mataji has come to do one job only,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.720
and that is to awaken this subtle energy within us,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.640
that energy which we can as

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.480
the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.640
She’s come to awaken it and put us

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.880
in touch with our Self, our Spirit.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.600
When that happens

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.920
you begin

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.520
to feel the bliss and the joy

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:43.200
of that final aspect of your spiritual ascent.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.400
So

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.480
be open minded for those people that have come for the first time,

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.240
be prepared to receive something great,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.800
be prepared to assume

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.840
that you can become that higher being,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.480
that you can in fact become a spiritual being.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.680
There are so many anti-Christs,

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.400
there is so many forces of negativity, there is so much confusion

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.120
in the world today and so many

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.720
people have come on this earth whether as

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.040
I said anti-Christs

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:27.040
or else confused people to mislead us,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.080
and to perhaps take us through the highways and byways

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.520
in our seeking.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720
Self-realization establishes something

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.360
within you in which you can discriminate.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.600
In which you can know truth from falsehood.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.240
In Sahaja Yoga which is what happens

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.080
when you get your realization -

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.200
Sahaja Yoga means spontaneous Self-realization -

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.480
when that happens

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.040
you become a collective being.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.280
You become collectively conscious,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.200
you start to feel on your finger tips

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.520
the centers of others, you start to feel in your awareness

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.720
what is happening within your own subtle body.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.240
You can give realization to others.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.760
You can discriminate between the people who are seekers

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.880
and the people who are false.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.040
You can discriminate between those who

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.680
wish their spiritual ascent

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.960
and those who are opposing evolution.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.600
And this is important because we have never had any yard stick

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.280
by which we could judge other than our mental activity,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.080
other than our emotional activity.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.760
Now, when you get your Self-realization you have that yard stick.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.360
You have that immutable measure by which

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.680
you can assume truth.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.320
When you begin to feel the truth

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.400
on your finger tips

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.360
as the cool wind of the Holy Spirit,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.760
as that power that lies within you,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.720
you know for certain that you have met

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.120
that aspect of your nature which is indeed truth.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.800
There will always be people who try to persuade you otherwise,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.600
there will always be the prophets of doom

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.680
that this world is going to be destroyed and so many things.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.840
But just ask yourself if the God Almighty that

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.400
created this earth, is going to destroy His own creation.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.760
We all have to get our Self-realization.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.160
We all have to become part and parcel of the Kingdom of God.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.960
We all have to become witness to the play of the Divine.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.360
We all have to become like Christ.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.880
We have to become the principle that is the Spirit.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.720
And ultimately when we achieve that

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.720
the final joy of Self-realization,

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.920
begins it’s process

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.960
of taking us to that final union with God.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.680
In Sahaja Yoga

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.800
the first experience of Self-realization may be very subtle,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.560
it may be very slight, and you may be a little unconvinced.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.720
Unconvinced rationally or in terms of perception.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.840
Because as I said this subtle

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.120
cool wind that you begin to feel on your hand

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.120
may in fact be very very slight.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.200
It may be because this chakra here is a little blocked because

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.920
of damage to that center,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.440
so don't despair if you don't feel it the first time.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.120
Know that inside yourself

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.920
something great has happened.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.360
And when that great happening takes place

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.160
you owe it to yourself to develop it.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.760
Thousands of people are developing it around the world.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.960
In Australia it's growing

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.800
and it's growing very strongly.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.840
Mother believes that Adelaide is going to be one of the centers

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.240
where it grows strongest.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.080
Already so many people have got it.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.040
Already so many of the real seekers

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.600
have come and had the blessings of Mother.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.720
Already they are feeling

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.120
the Kundalini within themselves, they are feeling

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.120
the cool wind, they are attaining their Spirit.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.120
This is what we have been all seeking.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.080
This has been our goal whether we have been a Christian,

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.080
or a Jew or a Hindu or a Muslim,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.560
whatever it may be, this has been the goal

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.720
and yet we are all one,

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.680
we are all part of God Almighty. There is no difference.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.560
What the Buddha said is no different to what Christ has said.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.480
What the Hindu scriptures and the saints

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.880
have said is no different

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.120
to what Mohammed has said.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.520
They have all said the same thing.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.360
So we have to become that integrating force

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.080
that is a realized soul.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.200
We have to get the enlightenment, we have to awaken within ourselves

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.040
the divinity that has been sleeping there for so many births,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.200
and we have to get the reward of all our seeking.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.960
Mother is the one who can deliver the goods,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.480
Mother is the one who can awaken the Kundalini.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.080
She is the one who can slowly

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.480
and patiently and lovingly nourish Her children

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.800
after they get their Self-realization.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.480
She is the one who is respected by the saints

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.320
as the Mother, as the Mataji

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:48.040
who has come on this earth to give the blessings of God

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.560
to the seekers, and to give the creation it's own meaning.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.720
So without any further introduction from me

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.800
it gives me great pleasure ladies and gentlemen

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.760
to introduce to you again

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.720
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.760
To all the seekers of truth, I bow.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.120
We have to be the true seekers of truth,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.280
which is a rare quality people think,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.640
but I have found out that in this world

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.600
there are many

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.440
seekers who are honestly and earnestly seeking.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.800
They are seeking the truth.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.640
They are trying to find out

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.640
what is within them,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:13.560
they are trying to find out what is being prophesied about them.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.120
It has been prophesied that the day of judgment will come.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.720
This is the day of judgment,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.360
when you are going to be judged.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.440
You are not going to be put into any scales

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.280
or there is no other measure by which you are going to be judged

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.720
but by knowing

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.680
how far truthful you are about your seeking

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.760
and how far you can gain something about it.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.160
Today I had a chance

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.920
to be with some media people

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.080
and yesterday also.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:59.080
I feel some of them just want to bring some controversy

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.600
to make it more interesting perhaps.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.440
Whatever it is -

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.160
as a Mother I have to tell you that I have to take nothing from you.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.960
I have come here to give you.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.760
If you are identified with any organization

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.520
or you think you can fight for an organization

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.640
it would be very much better that you should not disturb us,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.840
who are the people who are real seekers sitting down here.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.760
It would be very civil of you to be

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.800
away from us, because we are not identified with any organization,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.080
but with our own Self.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.800
We have no organization you know in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.720
And every type of a person is allowed to come in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:52.680
so that he gets the full advantage of his destiny.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.960
In My own

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.920
experiences I have found out

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.880
that people in the West are rather difficult

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.360
to get realization to begin with.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.960
In India there can be six thousand people

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.920
and just in a split of a second

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.080
their Kundalini rises and they get their realization.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.680
It’s a fact. But even when they get realization

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.400
they are not so seriously adhering to it

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.920
and they don't try to learn about the technique

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.360
of the laws of God's Love.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.920
But in the West on the contrary,

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.240
though the first motion is very slow,

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.800
some people get it and lose it,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.840
but they are very great seekers.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.960
They get completely transformed.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.480
I have seen people who have been drunkards, alcoholics,

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.800
who have been taking drugs and who have been homosexuals,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.880
who led a very wretched life,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.880
did all kinds of nonsensical things to ruin themselves.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.560
Once they get realization they really become so

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.240
aware of themselves their self esteem rises

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.200
and they take to Sahaja Yoga

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.920
in a very proper auspicious way.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.720
It's something surprising

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.200
that those who can get realization very fast

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.800
are not so good for giving realization to others.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.440
They do not seem to understand

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:35.600
that it has to be given to other people.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.640
While those who take more time,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.080
those who have suffered so much,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.280
those who have had a miserable life before,

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.320
those people who could be condemned as

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.320
the worst people on this earth

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.720
become so beautiful, not only that

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.800
but they take it upon themselves that this great

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.400
joy of God's Love must be given to others.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.720
But of course, despite all that, we do have some

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.080
funny people in every group sometimes who are

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.800
like dog in the manger,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.840
they don't get their realization nor do they allow others to get it.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.960
It's a - some feeling with very frivolous and flippant people,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.120
who are harmed very badly,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.400
still they don't want to have the blessings of God

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.200
and try to create problems for us.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.880
It is a sad thing that it should happen

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.880
in a country where there are so many seekers who are already lost.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.760
So many people who are God's own people are lost.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.840
One must have some civil sense in understanding

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.800
that those who are lost are the people of God.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.920
As William Blake has said

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.640
that the men of God will become prophets,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.880
and those who will become prophets will make other prophets.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.360
This is the first thing that happens to you

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.080
that you become a prophet.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.720
In the sense that you become a saint,

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.680
in the sense that the energy of God which is all pervading

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.720
which is doing all living work starts flowing through you.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.560
And when it starts flowing through you, you can use that power,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.320
not only to correct yourself and improve yourself

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.480
but give this, the blessing of peace and bliss to God.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.520
Please be seated properly,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.080
if you can't sit you sit on the chair all right?

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.080
Now,

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.320
for us it is important to understand that I am here

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.920
talking about something that is extremely holy and auspicious.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.440
It has not worked out before.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.880
This is the first time in the history of spirituality,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.520
so many people are taking their realization.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.160
As I said, this is the time of last judgment.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.720
This is the time of resurrection which Mohammed Sahib has described

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:10.240
that at that time your hands will be speaking.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.080
How can hands speak?

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.320
Anybody can say that, "How can hands speak?"

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.480
But the Muslims don't think about it.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.960
They just say, “Let us do namaz all the time morning till evening,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.840
do the exercise of namaz and we will get realization.”

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.880
Christians think that they will get their

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.960
realization if they take their baptism.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.760
It's not so.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.920
All these religions were established much before

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.560
just to keep you in balance.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.720
To live a life of moderation.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.760
On the contrary human beings have gone to the extremes.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.640
But I must tell you that the Divine is so generous,

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.320
is so kind, is working so fast

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.480
that despite all these things that you have done to yourself

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.400
and to your society,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.040
and as human beings the way you have erred

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.320
or whatever you have done, it just forgets and forgives.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.480
Because you are the children of God.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.960
Because He is your Father.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.720
He is the Father who is love,

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.360
who is truth, who is joy.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.040
And He is anxious that His children should enter into His kingdom

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.400
and enjoy all the blissful thing that He has to give.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.400
Now if you want to see

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.960
how you are made, you'll be surprised.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.160
We must have self esteem.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.480
We must understand that God has created us with very great care,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.600
with very great love to become human beings.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.320
And we should not for anything whatsoever,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.280
whosoever it may be, the guru

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.120
or the cult or the religion or anything,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.960
should neglect ourselves.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.640
Then you will be responsible for your own neglect

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.280
and not God Almighty or any one of these prophets;

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.520
they have said that you can be saved.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.400
Now as you see within us lies these subtle centers.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.240
These subtle centers are

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:20.000
the ones which, who represent within us

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.760
a different stage of evolution.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.440
First of all if you see the first center, is the Mooladhara.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.560
Now this center is very important

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.400
because - for Australians I should say -

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.160
because in the universe this center is Australia.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.120
Australia is the place

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.040
where this center we can consider as manifesting,

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.640
the powers of Mooladhara chakra.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.160
It is the most powerful center in the whole being.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.520
Because it is the power

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.360
of innocence in a human being.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.080
The innocence that is the matter, matter is innocent,

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.040
animals are innocent,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.400
because they haven’t developed their ego so far,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.920
neither they have got those conditionings

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.880
by which we are supposed to be sinners.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.160
A dog or a horse or a camel,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.600
none of them think that they are sinners.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.160
It's only we think that we are sinners

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.440
and we have done something wrong.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.960
The reason for this is that God has given us freedom.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.080
So whatever we have done in that freedom

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.040
we feel responsible for it

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.000
and we start condemning ourselves as sinners and all those things.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.600
But who feels that he is a sinner is the ego and not the Spirit.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.120
The Spirit does not commit any sin!

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.160
Is the purest of pure,

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.040
nothing can contaminate it,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.760
nothing can destroy it,

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.600
nothing can make it absolutely invisible.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.520
It is all the time there within our heart,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.280
watching what we are doing.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.360
As described in Gita is called as Kshetrajna,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.640
the one who knows the field, who watches the field,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.120
who is the witness of the field, which resides in our heart.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.760
All these things whatever I've said has to happen to us,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.640
otherwise it just becomes our mental activity.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.920
I have nothing to bring in anything that is controversial,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.360
everybody has brought out some sort of a thing

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.760
and said that this is this and this is this.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.880
But one must know that once you get

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.240
your Self-realization it must work.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.480
That's the point people do not understand,

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.520
that if you go to a guru,

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.400
did it work out your own powers?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.480
Maybe they might be paying you for doing some work,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.760
doesn't matter, that's another enterprise.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.080
But did it give you the reality?

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.920
Did it give your absolute meaning?

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.240
It has given you your purpose or not?

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.920
Has it finished your seeking or not?

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.120
You must ask these questions to yourself and be truthful about it.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.680
If not then you better get it.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.440
Now to say that I am the only person doing this,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.960
is all comes out of these people asking funny questions to you.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.280
Now the thing is, she asked me a question:

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.080
“Are you the only person doing it?”

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.800
I said, I don't know of any other.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.600
I mean you can twist it the way you like,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.160
but so far I haven't met anyone who is giving mass-realization.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.320
I have not met anyone and if I meet I will be very happy to retire.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.440
Even if the sahaja yogis

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.920
who come up to that level can give mass-realization just like that

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.800
it would be a nice idea to retire

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.880
because now I am going to be 60 years of age

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.560
and I think I deserve retirement after the hard work of 14 years.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.000
This one is the first center as I told you,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.120
is this great country of

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.640
Ganesha - Australia.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.800
The symbol of this is already expressed

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.760
in the place called as Ayers Rock.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.760
Ayers Rock if you go and see

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.160
has the symbol which is embodying

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.520
the great deity that resides on this.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.320
That has the same colour if you see there

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.920
and it has the same deity sitting down there

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:30.040
which is called as Shri Ganesha in the Sanskrit language.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.880
Now this deity, innocent deity

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.000
or the one which is representing innocence,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.320
incarnated on this earth

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.040
for our sake, for our salvation

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.520
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.600
He incarnated and He is bestowed upon

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.880
that center of Agnya which you see there

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.920
which is actually the body is made of the sun.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.560
That's why most of the Christians are sun worshippers.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.080
This great personality came on this earth

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.400
with a very great work because all others

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.720
also you can see, but today I would like to speak about Him.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.320
I was told in Adelaide there are lots of churches.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.240
But every human being is a church of God

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.080
and temple of God, in that resides Christ,

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.720
at this point which is the gate you can see very clearly,

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.760
in that gate He resides

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.360
and that is the cross which He has carried,

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.240
on which He was crucified,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.920
because this cross was too tight,

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.240
and something had to pass through it.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.520
His resurrection is the message to all the Christians

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.480
that the way He resurrected

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.160
you are going to be resurrected by God Almighty.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.880
He came on this earth,

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.760
suffered for you and He died on the cross,

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:58.160
just to give you this special privilege of having this great

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.480
Agnya Chakra there which He adorns.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.720
This is the Agnya Chakra within us.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.360
Now the mistake lies in one thing

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.560
that when we say of baptism, it is not an artificial process.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.320
This is a living process.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.720
Christ could not have talked of something artificial or ritualistic.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.080
What He said, baptism was that the Kundalini should be awakened

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.040
and it should penetrate through this fontanel bone area,

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:32.920
and should give you the experience of the Holy Ghost.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.720
Now this what I am saying

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.520
is also written in an Indian book about our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.760
and we do not read the right books in Sanskrit

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.480
because they are not translated.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.040
What we are reading are the so called pseudo people

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.640
who came about from 50 years back and try to preach

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.000
about Hinduism or some sort of a "ism".

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.800
But about Christ nobody told.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.920
When they came from other countries to visit India,

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.240
nobody told that He is the Maha Vishnu

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.440
because nobody knew about it. They could not relate it.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.400
They could not relate, they could not tell

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.680
that He was the incarnation of the Maha Vishnu.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.720
And Maha Vishnu is the one, if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.920
everything tallies exactly with a character of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.480
If you read it you will be amazed how clearly He is described.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.680
Even it is described that first He was an egg

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:41.560
and out of the egg, half egg was Shri Ganesha

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.800
and the half egg became Shri Jesus Christ.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.080
And then, that's why on a Easter day if you know,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.440
we always give eggs, meaning

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.760
we human beings are eggs at this time

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.200
as human beings, but we have to become the bird.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.440
He came on this earth specially for creating a very special

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:10.240
type of device and an awareness within us.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.720
Because this is the gate as I told you

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.200
to the Kingdom of God which is the limbic area within us.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.320
Whatever is in the subtle is in the gross.

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.360
So this limbic area was

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.200
to be achieved through piercing through one gate that is

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.120
our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.040
Now how to pierce it was a problem because

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.720
if anybody tried to pierce it, he may just

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.640
go on the sides and become something else but a superconcious man.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:49.440
So it was Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:53.640
the Ruh, the All Pervading Power, the Chaitanya, the Omkara,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.600
He came on this earth and He did that job for us,

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.560
because He resides there.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.960
Now what He said by

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.560
the second birth or by baptism was

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.800
that this Kundalini which is lying

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.200
at the triangular bone there, has to rise.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:18.640
Rise and penetrate through this center,

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.600
awaken Jesus Christ there.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.200
Now the - what great miraculous thing

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.160
He has done that once you awaken this center within us,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.800
these two institutions on the left and the right,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.080
one is the ego, another is the super ego;

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.640
one is the ego which gives us

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:43.320
all ideas about ourselves which are not really self esteem

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.120
but something false.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.280
And super ego is the

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.400
condition in which we human beings become conditioned,

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.720
in which we accept conditions: I am this, I am this, I am this.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.360
Both the things are sucked in by the awakening

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.960
of the Kundalini of this great incarnation on this earth.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.560
Once it is sucked in what you find that

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.160
on top of your head where you reach

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:15.640
this place, you find that it has become an open space now.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.560
And suddenly you find the Kundalini is rising

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.560
and you can feel the breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.400
In the bible about Holy Ghost very little is written,

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.400
for that you have go to Indian Scriptures were She is described

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:35.200
as the power of God Almighty, as Adi Shakti.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.200
It is not proper to bind yourself like a horse

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.920
and see whatever is available but open yourself out

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.920
and see the references that are given about the great happening

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.120
of the advent of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.320
Now what relations He has with Shri Krishna, with Shri Rama

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.320
with other deities and other prophets

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.440
is to be seen later on. When you come to Sahaja Yoga

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.680
gradually you realize that they are all related to each other.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.480
And Christ has openly

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:11.200
said that those who are not against are with Me.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.440
The three people who went to

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.160
see Jesus when He was born were Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.240
Is described, were the three great people

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.680
who went to see Jesus He was born was

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:29.680
Shri Krishna as Vishnu

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.520
and Mahesha is Shiva,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.920
and Brahma as Brahmadeva.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.520
All these people went to worship.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.520
Nobody knew from where they came,

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.720
who they were, they were called as the three wise men.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.960
Now whatever I am saying has to be first experienced,

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.960
because if I say something need not be true;

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.760
as I would say that it is not essential

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.120
that you should believeevery word I say.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.480
On the contrary blind faith is against Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.360
It should happen to you first,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.600
once it happens then you will be amazed

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.320
that you yourself is a very great

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.680
miraculous instrument of God.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.360
You will be amazed, how this instrument works.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.160
Even the people who come to Me, say,

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.920
“Mother we are gone cases we are good for nothing,

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.800
we led a very bad life we are inauspicious.”

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.560
Every sort of thing, I said, "Now

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.240
let it be, you don't judge yourself.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.520
Let the Divine judge you, let's see what happens to you.

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:32.360
Why are you after yourself?

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.720
Forget it, first of all you did mistakes,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.840
doesn't matter, but now you are using that again to harm yourself.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.760
So please forget all the mistakes, everything that has been done,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.360
all wrong things you think you have done.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.640
Only you get what you have."

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.840
I am here just to give that what you have.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.640
Now this great happening takes place

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.920
in such a smooth way in people who are normal people.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.320
But not in all people I would say.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.800
Some people do not feel it because they have some abnormalities

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.880
in their different centers which are placed within you.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.560
These are the subtle centers expressed outside as gross centers.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.320
They are all the time there,

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.720
but the deities within them are not yet enlightened.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.000
They only get enlightened when the Kundalini rises

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.480
and pierces through the fontanel bone area.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.640
Now the Spirit resides in the heart.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.560
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.520
and Holy Ghost is the Power of God,

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:43.080
the Shakti of God which manifest everything else.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:46.240
You'll be amazed how in the gross these things can be seen,

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.760
absolutely into the grossest thing.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.840
My son in law is a great photographer

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.080
and he was working on Himalaya, ultimately I said you take it

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.720
from some old books and find out about it.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.960
So I gave him an idea that you go and see near Manasarovar.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.800
There is a place called Manasarovar

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.920
where also you find the Sadashiva is kept,

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.320
just like a human face.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:17.880
Twelve miles of area you can see that it's just a human being,

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.000
a face of a human being which is called as Dakshinamurthy,

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.920
which is looking towards the south.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.520
And this one is just a - not melted at all,

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.080
nothing, is all the time there

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.080
and if you see the face there are two other

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.440
aspects of Him are shown on His head.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.360
But I told him that in Manasarovar

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.120
if you go that is the super ego, Manasa.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.840
Manasa means the emotional mind, you see,

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.280
English language is rather funny

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.640
but I tell you Manasa means the emotional mind.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.160
There is this emotional mind represented as Manasarovar.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.080
And after that I told him there must be another one.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:07.240
He said yes there is another one which is called as Rakshastal.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.200
Rakshasa you know, the word Rakshasa means a devil - Rakshastal.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.800
And now that Rakshastal is so turbulent

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.880
despite the fact they are close to each other

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.480
and between them is placed this Sadhashiva's image,

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.880
but this Rakshastal is so turbulent

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.040
that one can't believe that the same,

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.280
at the same place these two are having a different type of nature.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.560
And those people who went with him would not even touch that

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.640
water of that Rakshastal, because it represented the ego,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.000
less they become ego oriented, so they would not touch it.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.040
So this was nothing, you see there are so many things in the gross

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:48.320
you can make it out whatever is described in the old times

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.320
is there existing, it is there.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.560
In the same way human beings are in the intermediate state

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.360
and if you go even subtler

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.720
you'll find all these centers are within you.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.840
Now how can you prove through Kundalini

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.560
that what I am saying is true?

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.960
That we have to see for oneself because in the West

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.720
I have to go on convincing people, convincing people,

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.480
pleading them for their realization.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.800
Just for getting realization I have to put all, put forward

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.560
all kinds of explanations, all kinds of suggestions

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.560
that they should believe that they can get Self-realization.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.400
There are people also who say, “How can you get it so easily?”

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.040
But if I say you can, why not try it, what's the harm?

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.960
It is so difficult to convince a

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.240
mind which is all the time thinking about it,

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.960
you can't think about it.

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.680
You can't think about a sprouting of the seed, it just works out,

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.440
if you put a seed in the mother earth it just works out.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.280
You don't have to think,

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.320
if you start thinking about it, will it sprout? It will not.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.720
It is the capacity of the mother earth that does the job.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.720
But that time we take it for granted.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.320
In the same way if I say you can get your Self-realization,

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.000
people start being doubtful about it.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.040
Another thing is, that it is the other way round,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.120
it is you who has to take something

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.880
not that I have to take anything from you.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.560
You cannot give Me anything, it's you who has to benefit by it,

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.560
not Me. So why there should be a question

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.360
when I am not selling anything,

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.120
when I am not acquiring anything out of you,

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.960
when there is no possibility of you being exploited

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.400
or plundered by Me or used by Me.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.280
Why should you get this doubt in your mind?

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.080
Is it also that you feel doubtful about yourself?

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.760
But that is to be decided by the Divine and not by you.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.480
So please first of all try to know that you are the Spirit

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:45.520
and that you have to become the Spirit

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.640
and that once you become the Spirit

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.360
you become collectively conscious.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:55.480
Today only when I went for this interview for the ABC,

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.480
the gentleman was -

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.280
of course interviewed Me, when I came out there was a lady.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.320
And I told the lady that you have got liver trouble.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.280
She asked Me, "How do you know, did he tell you?"

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.920
I said, "Nobody told Me, but I know because I know."

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.680
So that's what happens to you, that you become

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.840
collectively conscious, you can feel it on your hands

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.960
what's wrong with others and with yourself.

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.720
Now when we come to this

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.080
point of realization, we have to know

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.760
that the problems of this world are due to one fact,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.480
that we have not achieved our absolute.

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.080
Some people think by doing alternate work we’ll be happier.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.280
If supposing somebody is a capitalist he’ll become a communist.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.480
Then if he is the communist, he’ll become a socialist.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.720
These are all manufactures of this brain.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.240
But actually if you ask, I'm a

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.040
complete capitalist because I have all the powers

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:55.040
and I am a complete communist

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.320
because I can’t live without giving it to you.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:03.000
So how the communism and capitalism, which is so artificial outside,

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.480
becomes a reality with you, that you become empowered

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.000
with your real powers and not unreal powers

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.520
because possessions and things are unreal.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.320
They are not real powers,

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.760
and once you get these real powers you want to share it with others.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:23.480
You want to give it to others, you want to work it out for others.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.880
And under these modern circumstances where we think

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.200
we are very frustrated and we are unhappy,

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.840
that's why we are going to God, is a wrong statement.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.520
You are coming to God because you have been seekers

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.400
of ages.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:42.720
You have been seeking long time back

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.960
and this is the time, the fruit of it is coming.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.800
I've met so many children, even in Australia, who are born realized.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.440
Great saints are taking their birth today

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.280
just to do this God's work

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:59.760
and you will find that you are one of them who has been seeking.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.720
In Nala Damayanthi Puran, which was written

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.160
I think sixteen thousand years back,

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.720
it is mentioned that this Nala got very angry with Kali -

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.920
Kali is the one who governs this modern times -

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.640
and He said, "I am going to kill you,

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.160
because you create confusion in the minds of people,

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:18.360
you create complete confusion of values,

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.720
and you make them destroy themselves.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.760
So I better destroy you once for all,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.800
so there is no problem for human beings."

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
So Kali said, "All right you can destroy Me

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.720
but I have some good points,

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.480
you must know also the importance of My being there."

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.200
He said, "What is your importance?" He said, "The importance is

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.600
that when I will come on this earth to rule

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.320
that time, these people who are now

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.480
wondering in the Himalayas, wondering in the hills

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.640
and dales all over the world who are seeking

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.240
outside the cities, outside the houses

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.560
will find the answer.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.200
They will find the God Almighty.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.040
They will find their Spirit!”

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.360
He said it about sixteen thousand years back

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.600
and that is today has started.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:10.080
The point where we have to

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.160
be really sure is, that this is the time.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.920
Because the signs and symptoms are like that.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.520
You can’t imagine so many people seeking

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.320
anywhere in the world,

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.840
anytime. When even Christ came

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.280
it was so difficult to carry those twelve people with Him.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.120
Nobody was seeking at the time.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.520
He of course gave sermons, He talked about it

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.240
that is the last, we can say,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.520
who was such a great Incarnation on this earth,

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.200
but nobody listened to Him.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.440
After that Mohammed came. When He lived how people treated Him!

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.200
They tried to poison Him, they tried to torture Him

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.360
and He had such a miserable life

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.360
that the Muslims today when they behave in the same manner,

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.720
it is most surprising that whatever He has suffered

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.120
the people have to support, suffer at the hands of these Muslims.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.960
There are other also ideas people have got

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.640
like we must suffer for our emancipation;

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.200
or we must cleanse ourselves.

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.720
Already somebody has suffered for us.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.360
There is no need for you to suffer and do all these things.

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:18.000
As I said that Jews believed in it and they denied Christ.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.840
Then they suffered, really they suffered,

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.760
but after that suffering was there any transformation?

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.040
On the contrary they were so embittered

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.680
the way they behave while killing these PLO-people,

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.120
you will be amazed, the same people who suffered so badly

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.520
forgot all that and became such cruel people

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.320
and they killed so many people.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.960
So this kind of a suffering doesn't bring

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.520
any kind of transformation within you.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:47.320
Transformation has to take place,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.840
this is the condition of your Self.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.720
If the Self is manifesting,

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.440
it is not that you believe in this and I believe in that,

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:58.920
It IS! It's no question of believing, IT IS so!

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.280
That is what it is, nothing to be believed into blindly

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.200
or to be professed into or to accept something,

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.440
but it is there within you and that is an absolute truth.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.120
Even if there are ten small children sitting

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.360
and they are realized souls

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.600
and if you ask them, "What is the condition of this gentleman?"

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:23.600
They will all raise one finger. This means only one thing,

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.560
because they can feel it, on their finger something burning,

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.840
maybe something numb, maybe something heavy.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.760
All of them, even if you tie their eyes, will say the same thing

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.760
because truth is the same.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.480
As all of us are sitting here we know it's night

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.840
and that the colour of this thing is greenish or whatever it is.

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:47.720
In the same way, when you get your realization, the feeling,

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.960
the awareness comes in your feeling and this feeling

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:57.120
tells you exactly where you are and what you have to do.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:02.000
It is a remarkable thing that you are a human being.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.000
Is the greatest work of God,

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.000
the greatest creation of God is human being.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.880
Of course you may think they are ugly

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.680
and you should have nothing to do with them.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.400
There are some people who just believe that

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.760
human beings are the ugliest thing. But they are not!

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.840
Only thing, they have not been put to the mains,

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:23.800
this is yoga, is the union with the Divine.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.760
Unless and until an instrument is put to the mains,

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.520
to its source, it has no meaning.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.520
In the same way unless and until

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.680
you are put to the mains, you will have no meanings.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.840
So the best thing is for you to be convinced

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.840
that you have to have your realization

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.800
and it can work out in a split of a second and let it work out.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.880
Just work it out is the best for you that anyone can

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.080
suggest that you become the Self.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.440
Now about the Self I have talked many a times, I told people

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.360
that Self is the one that is residing in your heart.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.200
But the seat of the Self is here, the Sadhashiva.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:14.040
He stands here and when the Kundalini rises and touches that,

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.360
the seat sends message to the Heart

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:23.160
and then the Heart starts feeling throwing those vibrations.

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.080
Actually it is not the Spirit that does

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:32.240
but it is the Kundalini after enlightenment starts pulsating.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.560
It’s so clear-cut, you can’t imagine,

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.120
it is so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.840
Now the result of this Self-realization -

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.200
in this short time I have to cover many points

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.200
and that's why I am trying to cover it up -

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.960
is first of all you get your physical

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.240
fitness. People ask Me, "How could You cure physically?"

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.320
If you are doctors here, you will understand

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.200
that doctors do not know anything about

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.120
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.160
That is the expression of the central path

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.520
within us called as the Sushumna Nadi.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.200
This parasympathetic nervous system gives us the balance,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.920
the sustenance.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.880
For example, if you are running fast your heartbeat increases.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.640
But it is slowed down

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:20.560
by the action of parasympathetic nervous system.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.280
When the Kundalini is awakened this parasympathetic nervous system

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:29.760
becomes evident in our awareness.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:35.040
First time the Spirit starts becoming

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.000
one with our attention.

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:40.560
Our attention itself becomes enlightened.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:42.360
Now when this Kundalini rises,

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:45.600
this parasympathetic nervous system starts manifesting itself

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.880
and whatever center is exhausted

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.480
by which an imbalance is created within us

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.200
in our physical body or in our emotional body

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.560
or in our mental body or in our spiritual body,

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:02.680
it starts absolutely

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:08.880
behaving in a manner as if we have reached our total blessings.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.760
It just disappears, it just disappears.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.640
And it is so surprising, that people don't want to believe it

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:20.280
because they have seen a person behaving this manner and that manner

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.520
and suddenly next day overnight they find

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:26.760
the person who is an alcoholic becomes a free bird.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.960
They find a drug addict becoming a free bird,

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.400
they can’t believe it. It is fantastic!

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:34.960
Everything that God does is fantastic.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.200
All His work we have taken for granted,

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.680
at least this living work of God

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.120
you can understand that it works within you.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.840
It is beyond all your dogmas,

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:48.040
all your philosophies, all your complications.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.960
Because it is unlimited,

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.280
while your brain is limited, your intelligence is limited.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.840
And if you want to understand God

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.560
you cannot understand It

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.120
by this limited thing, which is your brain.

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.880
Of course logically you can come to conclusion.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.120
You have to come to conclusion logically understanding that

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.320
you cannot pay for it, you cannot work it out,

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.120
it has to be spontaneous

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:18.400
and you cannot do it yourself.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.760
Everything you can do it yourself,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.920
but realization has to be worked out

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.200
by somebody who is an enlightened person.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.800
For example if I work it out for any one of you,

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.120
that person can work it out for others.

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.760
This is so simple as that and I think

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.360
it is high time that we should go in for realization,

00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.320
we have so many people and I won't be able to attend to you,

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:41.240
if I continue with the speech.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.720
Is it all right for you to have the realization now?

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.800
Just open any window here, either air condition or anything.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.400
If you do not treat yourself with respect,

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:55.520
nobody can treat you with respect.

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.720
So be respectful about it and try to

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.400
get the blessings of realization,

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.880
that would be a nice idea.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.560
By the way we have now been able to

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.520
get some people to work in Adelaide

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.840
for you to go further with your realization

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.560
and understanding what it is,

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.840
to learn the technique of it.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.760
And once you learn the technique

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.640
you will find it will help you a lot to help others.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:36.520
And if you are intelligent enough you can do it very well.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.440
Will you please all put your hands towards Me

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.720
like this, just like that.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.560
Those who don't want to do it

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.480
should please go away and leave us alone,

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.520
I would request you those who don't want to do

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.240
meditation should go away

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.280
and don't disturb others because it spoils the vibrations of people,

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:57.440
so those who don't want to do it please go away.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.560
You don't want to do it?
Can I ask a question?

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.520
No, no, no question today, I have had enough

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:04.480
of questions this morning, will you please go.

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:06.320
No you can write, all right.

00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:09.520
You can write to Me, you see the questions I had too many

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.240
and I want to attend to everyone.

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.680
You remember last time how much I had to work

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.440
and I couldn't attend to everyone.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.680
So it's better not to attend to anybody's personal questions,

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.920
it's not proper because I want to give attention to you all.

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.160
You see, if you have any questions you may write to Me

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.320
and I'll let you know. Please put your hands towards Me.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:30.720
All of you should do it. Those who do not want to do it, again I say

00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.960
please be civil and kind

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:37.640
and go away as proper people, and don't try to disturb us.

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:41.360
Please put your hands towards Us.

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.200
You may write your questions

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.240
and come and see Me tomorrow morning, all right?

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.880
If you have any questions, I'll give you special time.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.760
You have also questions? All right,

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.000
so can you go out now and write down.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:55.480
Why not? You cannot force yourself to be here,

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.480
it is very wrong. You want to force.

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.560
Why?

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.120
No that's not I am not going to waste any time with you, but

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.880
is very unkind of you to force us like that.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.560
We never come to your meetings, why should you come to our meeting

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.040
and disturb us? It's not proper.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.760
It's all right, forget it now!

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.800
We have, I have nothing to talk, no no it's all right,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.880
don't disturb us, please, please will you behave yourself, or ask him to get out.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.520
"Why do you call yourself God?”

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.680
All right, forget it just now,

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.360
you are God is it? What good have you done to anyone

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.120
that you are here to object Me?

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.760
Have you done any good to anyone so far? Not even to yourself.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.760
Then, why don’t you allow Me to do good to others?

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.640
All right. Now don't talk!

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.880
Keep your hands like this.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.400
I could see the way he is,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.560
I could see that, immediately I pointed out,

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.720
you see among all. All right keep yourself shut!

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.880
You only know how to talk, you have a big mouth,

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:53.040
that’s all, nothing more.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:58.320
Please close your eyes.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.280
Please close your eyes.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.040
With both hands towards Me,

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.240
you just close your eyes and don't worry about others,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.520
just think of yourself just now

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.880
that you have to have this experience.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.760
So many people had experience in the last meeting

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.720
and you all should have it.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.840
Even if you are thinking it does not matter.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.320
Let loose your attention, don't put any pressure on your attention.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.600
Just let loose your attention.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.760
Now as I told you the left hand

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.760
is the power of your desire.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.640
And the right side is the power of your action.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.120
So with your left hand on your lap in a very relaxed manner

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:58.920
you raise your right hand to your heart, to your heart

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.840
and ask a question within yourself, not loudly,

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.440
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.520
Just put your hand right on your heart.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.640
Left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me, just ask a question,

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:40.200
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.400
Now put this right hand on your stomach on the left hand side

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.720
which is the center of your

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.840
guru, the primordial master.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.320
As you are the master of yourself,

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.600
you just say, 'Mother, I am the master.'

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.280
'Am I the master?' we asked the other day,

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.440
today you say, 'Mother, I am my own guru , I am my own master.’

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:17.480
With full confidence you should say.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.360
You should understand it fully within yourself

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.800
that unless and until you become a master,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.560
you cannot make out who is true, who is not true.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:35.440
You cannot make it out! So first of all you become the master.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.080
Put your right hand

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:46.520
on your stomach on the left hand side and ask a question,

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.920
if you have come today for the first time.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.160
But those who've got realization

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.480
the other day must say, ’Mother, I am the master.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.160
I am the guru.'

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.760
You don't need any guru because your Spirit is the guru.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:14.880
Your Spirit is the guru! Just awaken your Spirit.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:31.360
Now again raise your hand higher on the heart

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.280
and say,

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:42.440
'Mother, I am the Spirit.’  Just say that.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.920
Now put this right hand

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.400
on the left side of your neck

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:22.720
which is another center of Vishuddhi.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.800
You are yourself raising your own Kundalini.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.080
At this center you have to say, 'Mother, I am not guilty.'

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.960
Say it again, not to feel guilty for anything

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:41.080
that you think you have done wrong.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.400
Just say, 'Mother, I 'm not guilty.'

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.480
Because the instrument that you are

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.680
has to be cured by the Divine.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:13.800
Because you have to do God's work. This is God's work!

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:18.280
Unless and until you feel

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.240
completely relieved of your guilt,

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.360
how can you work out God's things?

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.080
If you have said mantras or something in unauthorised way,

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.680
also you develop this trouble on the left side

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.480
which is a very dangerous thing to develop

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.920
and thus you develop a heart trouble

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.520
and can be at a very early age,

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.360
you might suffer from a heart trouble.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:08.600
So better say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’ If you are the Spirit

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.240
then how can you be guilty?

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.320
There is another danger that lies while saying all these mantras

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.320
that one can develop diseases like cancer,

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.200
osteomalayetie and all these by saying wrong mantras,

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.400
guided by some wrong gurus.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.760
So if you have done anything like that

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:36.320
you have to say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.480
It can have very serious effects, very serious effects,

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.480
specially the muscular part can be absolutely

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.400
paralysed on the left side.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:11.080
Now put your right hand across the forehead

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.160
and say,

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.760
'Mother, I forgive everyone.’

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.040
This you have to say with full heart and full understanding

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.920
because the other day, you remember

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.520
that when you said it, immediately you got your realization.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.480
Before that it was all blocked up in the blockage.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.400
You have to forgive, forgive others,

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.840
forgive others! If you have self esteem

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:44.960
then you will respect others also, otherwise you cannot have respect.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.120
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot respect others.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.400
The first thing is you must say, 'I forgive everyone.’

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.480
Not to get upset by what has happened

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:01.880
or what somebody does to you, but just to say, 'I forgive everyone.’

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.880
Some people say it is difficult to forgive

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.400
but I think it is a myth.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.640
Because when you forgive what do you do? You just

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.920
are forgiving yourself

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.520
because you are not anymore suffering

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.560
from the embitterment from others.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.440
Now put the same hand on top of your head.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.560
First on top of your Sahasrara.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:45.920
Now you have to see, it has to work, it has to work out,

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.640
it's not just talking, but it has to work out.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.280
Now see for yourself,

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.760
raise your hand a little higher.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.360
At this stage you have to ask for realization,

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.720
because I cannot cross your freedom.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.200
So say, 'Mother, please give us realization" at this point.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.160
just put your hand

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:13.040
parallel to your fontanel bone area.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.480
Now put the other hand and see

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.200
if there is a cool breeze coming out.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.000
Put your right hand towards Me,

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.080
just put your right hand towards Me,

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.560
whether you are sick or anything, you just work it out.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.560
It's there, yes.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.880
You have to convince yourself.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.920
Nobody can convince you, it is you who has to convince yourself.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.640
You have to feel it yourself.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.960
If you are not feeling it, then there is something wrong with you.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.200
Doesn't matter, we'll work it, it should, it should work out.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.120
If you are not feeling it then is not correct.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:00.960
Now you can also change again the hand and say that -

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.040
find for yourself,

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.240
and ask a question, 'Is this the

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.800
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?' Ask a question.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.920
Now rapport is established, just see for yourself.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.160
See now how you are feeling cooler with the same

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.200
thing, is because you have become yourself an air conditioner.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.080
That's why you all are feeling cooler

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.600
otherwise you all are feeling so hot.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.280
Where is that heat gone now? Just see the proof.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.200
If there is too much heat that means you are either

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.160
a liver patient or some disease there which is to be attended.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.240
See for yourself.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.280
If you, even if you are paid by some guru,

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.080
better get your realization

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.200
because they can give you only money,

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.640
which you can't take with you. Better take your realization,

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.120
to be wise and sensible, be good children.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.560
Take your realization! This is the chance of lives!

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.360
Now put your both the hands like that

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.280
and ask a question in your heart,'Is this the

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:41.360
breeze of the Holy Ghost we are feeling?'

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:48.520
You will start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.160
the sensation crawling down your hands.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.640
All right? Now put your hands towards Me.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.000
I'll also teach you how to give realization.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.240
I'll try to teach you how to give yourself a realization

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.520
which is a very simple method of maintaining your realization.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.440
Apart from that

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.040
there are going to be some sahaja yogis here

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.640
who are going to help you to progress further.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.280
This hand is to be placed in front of your

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.640
Kundalini like this, this is the

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.880
fixed hand, you can say the fixed movement,

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:34.920
and this right hand is to be taken round like this.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.120
higher in front and down. Everything should be intelligible,

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.320
you should understand why we do it. You see clockwise method

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.120
is better to raise the Kundalini. Now do it,

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.880
it's not just to tell some

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.040
mantras to someone and you jump like a frog,

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.400
it's really, it should happen in a way that is happening.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.160
Now put your hands like that. Now take it down.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.560
Again we have to give a knot up there,

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.120
it's the raising of the Kundalini. Let's do again.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.360
The truth is so abounding, that you deny it is dishonesty,

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.480
is dishonesty, complete dishonesty!

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:17.920
Now take it up, one more. Now weave it up.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:29.640
Do it one more, now thrice you have to do it, one,

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.000
two,

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.240
three. Now see for yourself.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:41.560
All right?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.320
You feel very peaceful.

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.360
The other day I had a lady who came quite stunned,

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.080
she could not believe that she is so much changed

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.920
and she said, “I have become a free person now.”

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:01.080
All right? Good.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:05.200
So thank you very much and if you have any other problem

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.320
of some disease or anything

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.040
you can come and see Me now.
