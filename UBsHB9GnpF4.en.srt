00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,486
Easter Puja, Hounslow, UK - 1985-0408

2
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:06,805
Happy Easter to you all.

3
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:13,815
So we celebrate Easter

4
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:19,729
to show how Christ resurrected, resurrected Himself.

5
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:27,243
The spirit that is Christ has to resurrect

6
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:40,441
out of the material manifestation of the divine itself.

7
00:00:40,642 --> 00:00:48,575
The matter is manifested,

8
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:58,449
because we ourselves have created it.

9
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:07,421
Not that we are born out of matter, our body,

10
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:13,941
but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it.

11
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:23,816
Whatever you want, that sustains itself by your desire,

12
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:28,326
because now you are on the stage.

13
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:32,412
If you want to sustain the matter,

14
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:38,462
if you want to keep the matter as the first priority,

15
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:42,881
it will remain.

16
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:46,887
It cannot disappear.

17
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:51,066
It has to go out of your mind,

18
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:55,808
that matter cannot hold you any further.

19
00:01:56,008 --> 00:02:02,483
Christ rose out of the matter, came out
of the tomb which symbolises the matter

20
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:07,686
which has enclosed us within,

21
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:13,033
which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

22
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,561
Throw away, throw away the stone that is covering this grave.

23
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:27,353
Get out of that and stand outside it.

24
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,803
This is the message of Christ’s resurrection.

25
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:39,773
The tomb that we have created, we have created ourselves,

26
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:48,392
because we have allowed people to dominate us.

27
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:57,031
We have allowed them to make these graves for us,

28
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:05,479
we have allowed them to bury Christ within ourselves,

29
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:10,718
because we were afraid.

30
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:19,972
But Christ has to rise.

31
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:25,290
So we create our own matter through our conditionings,

32
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:31,275
through our fears, through our absolute wrong ideas

33
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:37,259
about goodness and kindness and compassion.

34
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:42,395
In the light of the Spirit, you can see what we think as compassion

35
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:52,730
is nothing but a kind of sympathy which leads you nowhere.

36
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:00,338
But one should learn to see everything in the light of the Spirit.

37
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:06,178
But do we use all the time the light of the Spirit? We do not.

38
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:13,221
For Christ, it was not difficult, because He was the Spirit.

39
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:17,298
But He has shown you the way.

40
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:22,938
He crucified Himself to show you the way.

41
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:29,746
All the ideas about sophistication,

42
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:36,679
about our standing in the society,

43
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,776
how we relate ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country,

44
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:51,330
to our politics, to our economics and the world at large,

45
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,416
all of them can tie us down to that tomb.

46
00:04:58,213 --> 00:05:02,396
You belong to another category, I’ve told you a hundred times.

47
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:07,336
And a category which is the Spirit,

48
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:14,964
which can rise above all the tombs, can throw away everything.

49
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:18,487
This way you are conditioned.

50
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:21,737
All absurd ideas have been accepted,

51
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:28,409
which you cannot explain why you were conditioned like this.

52
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,334
Why I talk more of conditioning? Because of England.

53
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,164
English are very much conditioned people.

54
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:40,664
The others are Americans who are abandoned.

55
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,002
I mean, you cannot talk to them about anything

56
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:47,079
because they cannot be rooted into anything.

57
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,665
But the English are too much conditioned people,

58
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:56,259
and when they are too much conditioned, they build their own tombs.

59
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,731
All these ideas are to be seen

60
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:06,957
with a new dimension of awareness that you have.

61
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:11,969
You are the Spirit.

62
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:18,427
Why should you worry about anything else

63
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,581
but your vibrations?

64
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,778
Because you are saints.

65
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:29,101
You should just worry about the comfort of your Spirit.

66
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:34,155
Whatever is congenial to your Spirit, just go on doing that,

67
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:39,291
observing that, accumulating that and sucking within yourself.

68
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:41,522
All conditionings will run away.

69
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,723
Because these conditionings you accept,

70
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:49,965
because they look comfortable, they look comfortable, but they are not.

71
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:58,336
Christ is a great example and if He is the one whom you follow,

72
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:02,242
if He is the one you have understood and recognised

73
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:04,828
in the light of your Spirit,

74
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:09,237
then you must know why did He go into the grave first of all.

75
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:11,768
The Man who was so powerful,

76
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:18,553
Who when He will come He’ll reduce all of them into ashes,

77
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:22,131
such a great personality like Him of Ekadasha Rudra.

78
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:26,436
Why did Christ

79
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:31,415
allow Himself to be crucified and to be buried into that?

80
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:38,384
Because He wanted to stoop down to the level of other people,

81
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:41,473
to come down to that level so that people should see that

82
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:47,957
through His life, they are shown that you can be resurrected.

83
00:07:48,157 --> 00:07:51,328
Now the Resurrection has taken place.

84
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:58,052
Sahaja Yogis are resurrected no doubt, but still one foot is in the grave.

85
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:04,542
And the second one I do not know whether it will be out or in,

86
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:09,171
it is just halfway through.

87
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:17,176
One foot is of course outside, no doubt,
but still is not yet touching the ground,

88
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:20,520
and the other cannot be lifted unless you push the ground,

89
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,730
this matter, again, to push it up.

90
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:32,373
If you live with your Spirit, you should have no fears,

91
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,893
you should have no worry.

92
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:40,458
See now, I will tell you how God is showing His ways, here.

93
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:47,700
Like in Durham, the fellow is now under complete fire,

94
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,274
he does not know what to do and he himself is so stupid,

95
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:56,774
as Sanskrit saying in is that "Vinash Kale Viprita
Buddhi." "When your destruction time comes,

96
00:08:56,974 --> 00:09:01,030
you think of all perverted things", vipareet Buddhi.

97
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:07,312
So his tongue if you, I mean see to
the way he speaks, I mean, blasphemous.

98
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:11,041
And he is under fire; he himself lit the fire

99
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:14,760
and is now sitting on top of it. And now when he gets the heat,

100
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,760
the heated words come out of his mouth.

101
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,911
We don’t have to do anything; it is all done, already.

102
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:29,033
They are baked and cooked in their own...

103
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,587
So why should we have fear?

104
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:44,204
But we should know what is right and what is wrong.

105
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:48,317
That is only possible because you are with the Absolute

106
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:51,898
that is the Spirit. And related to the Absolute,

107
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:55,437
if you do everything related to it, you are doing the right thing.

108
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,968
If you are related to Christ, how can you do wrong?

109
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:03,619
That is one of the proofs that they are not Christians of any kind,

110
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:08,299
because none of the Christian organisations have done anything good,

111
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:16,190
whatsoever, except for creating fire for themselves.

112
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,803
So you can see clearly how this conditioning

113
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:26,440
has worked within us, because
we have been so-called Christians,

114
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,595
we have been going to churches, we have been worshipping Christ as they told us,

115
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:38,430
the way they told us we worshipped
Him, everything regimented.

116
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:48,116
The One who came to resurrect us from the bondage of the grave,

117
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:53,639
we used Him to build our graves.

118
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:04,518
Now you are out of it, thank God, but take out the other foot, fast.

119
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:11,446
This is one advantage you have because you have Christ before you,

120
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:17,397
but also there is a disadvantage because Christ has been used

121
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:21,269
to set you down in the grave.

122
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,076
So change your concept about Christ,

123
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:28,988
know Him through your vibrations, what He was.

124
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,597
I mean, as a child I knew what was going wrong with Christians

125
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,284
and left and right, little girl like Me about seven years,

126
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:39,847
I used to give big lectures.

127
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:43,081
Even when I was baptised, I was horrified.

128
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:48,828
The way I was baptised by some stupid fellow.

129
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,605
I did not know what was he up to.

130
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:56,608
And then he put a bhoot on my head, I think,

131
00:11:56,808 --> 00:12:00,667
or something which hovered round and we met with a very big accident,

132
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:03,382
I fell down.

133
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:08,148
This bhoot must have put it in the horse, I feel, or somewhere,

134
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:10,359
another bhoot.

135
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,570
This priest, the stupid fellow, he belonged to the Lutheran Church.

136
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,200
I don’t know what you call that. Lutheran, imagine,

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,815
Martin Luther’s Church.

138
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,729
And that is how they baptised me.

139
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:31,548
I knew all about it, but I did not know what
to do. I must have kicked him quite a lot.

140
00:12:35,158 --> 00:12:39,889
But whatever it is, so-called, he baptised me.

141
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,750
I had to accept all foolish stupid things in this life,

142
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,578
because I had to show I was quite normal.

143
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:53,726
I mean, being accepting stupid is normal these days.

144
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,699
And to tolerate an idiot is even more normal.

145
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,734
So I had to show that. I knew very well what sort of a thing it was,

146
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:13,761
this fellow was up to, and I accepted the nonsense he did

147
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:21,568
and many other things I accepted just
to show that I am nothing special.

148
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:26,541
But I knew all about it.

149
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:30,983
When I saw the way Christ was described, I was aghast.

150
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:33,952
I said "what are they doing to Christ?".

151
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:40,999
I mean, nicely second crucifixion going on.

152
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:46,843
You also know about it.

153
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,450
Thank God there are so many to whom I can talk

154
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:57,220
and they understand my language.

155
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,586
But the Resurrection will not be complete unless and until

156
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:05,414
you pull out many out of their graves.

157
00:14:05,614 --> 00:14:07,831
I don’t know how you will go about it.

158
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:11,409
Look at this fellow Durham gets such a publicity

159
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,616
when he is doing all blasphemous things.

160
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:18,321
He is getting all the credit and kudos from people. What about us?

161
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:23,398
What are we doing?

162
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:28,144
Why not we write to the newspapers? Why not we talk to them?

163
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:31,382
"Observer" has given us a clue, I think. There is one gentleman,

164
00:14:31,582 --> 00:14:33,753
Mr. Wilson, who wrote quite nice things.

165
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:36,690
Why not write to him some letters?

166
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,000
Get to it.

167
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:56,746
Because, you see, what I am a little concerned about this matter is,

168
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,951
as it is they are half-hearted creatures.

169
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,215
Now, if this Durham fellow speaks like that,

170
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:05,064
who is now the big authority on Christianity, Christ,

171
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:09,722
His Mother and every body else, Mr. Durham.

172
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,332
And now this fellow if he goes on like this,

173
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:17,418
those who are half-baked will fall off to Communism,

174
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:22,006
and the rest of them who may remain also,

175
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:26,253
they may accept him.

176
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:35,077
So the Anglicans, the Anglo-Saxon brain, I am saying,

177
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:39,640
is going to accept Mr. Durham very well, I can see that.

178
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,427
Or else will just leave and become communists.

179
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:50,302
Have nothing to do with this God who has so many problems.

180
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,141
So in the Seminar of yours in Birmingham when you have,

181
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:59,406
I would like you to think over this new thing

182
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:04,219
that has come up in the heart of the Universe.

183
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:06,718
Everyone knows about Durham fellow,

184
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:09,554
they know he is blight, everything.

185
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:13,351
But what about us? We are so many, let us try to find out

186
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,644
how we can talk to these people sensibly,

187
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:21,987
talk to these Anglicans, find out about them,

188
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:26,466
and communicate to them what you have found out.

189
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,411
You need not say in the beginning only that I am the Adi Shakti

190
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:36,098
or I am the Redeemer and the Comforter, that Christ has said.

191
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:40,560
But we can start talking about it. Find out these people,

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,034
these Anglicans, church people, churchgoers who believe in God,

193
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:49,851
who believe in Christ.

194
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:55,662
I mean they are voting. Can you imagine?

195
00:16:55,862 --> 00:17:02,471
They are voting whether Christ was true or not. Can you vote like that?

196
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,938
You feel you are in a lunatic asylum or what? It is terrible!

197
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:16,900
They are taking votes, can you imagine such a thing like that?

198
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:21,949
At this moment we have an advantage,

199
00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:24,560
because they are so much confused, to give them a concrete idea

200
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,639
as to what is God, what is Christ, what is religion.

201
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,467
One side I feel very hurt and unhappy, I think,

202
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:39,345
these three days l have gone through real Resurrection myself.

203
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:44,633
The way things have been about Christ,

204
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:50,443
just I can’t bear it, I mean, it is too much.

205
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:56,658
You all should be stirred also, should be concerned.

206
00:17:56,858 --> 00:18:02,840
And you must go through it and see what you can do and tell them:

207
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,593
"Are you all mad or what? Why don’t you listen to sanity?"

208
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:13,174
As you know, when I went to Australia,

209
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:15,468
it is a different country altogether.

210
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,605
They are much more sensible people than you are.

211
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,824
I think the way they were exiled,

212
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:25,363
they learnt a lesson and they are better.

213
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:30,160
So I feel the English have to go into exile

214
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,527
or jail for a while to understand, deserve it.

215
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,718
They are very sensible, extremely sensible people.

216
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:44,053
You can talk to them, sense. Everyone.

217
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:47,343
The media is sensible, the people are sensible.

218
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,487
Thousands of them came. They repeated.

219
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:56,135
First programme we had once, it was 1 600, 2000.

220
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:02,806
Can you imagine such people? And out of them repeats were 600.

221
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:06,318
Now for the last how many years, we are having the same 600 people

222
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,278
again and again? What Seminars are we going to do?

223
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:15,223
All of us sitting and cooking some chicken, that’s all.

224
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:24,643
Or making some cake for Mother which She doesn’t eat.

225
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:32,611
Let us take out our satisfactions from these
little, little things into some thing bigger.

226
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:39,603
Let us talk about it, without fear.

227
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,925
We have to go and talk and tell people about it.

228
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:49,074
Take it a big way.

229
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:52,675
There should be no hindrance on this part.

230
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:55,120
We are a very big group and we can assert

231
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,605
and we can talk and meet people.

232
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:09,330
The situation has improved a lot,

233
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:16,794
because now I have to go to India as you know,

234
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:24,148
and in India, for me, the situation is much better.

235
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,836
It is not at all difficult.

236
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:34,651
As you know, I went to the hills at the foothill of Himalayas.

237
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:37,073
About 3000 people came from all over,

238
00:20:37,273 --> 00:20:41,847
the little, little villages that they had.

239
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,349
They didn’t take even a second to recognise me,

240
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:49,199
they were singing the praise of the Goddess of the Hills,

241
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:53,390
Goddess of the Tigers, Goddess of the Lions.

242
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,273
They just started singing my praise.

243
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:00,617
Without any lecture or anything. They were all joyous

244
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:04,131
that I have been there and they knew and they accepted Me and finished.

245
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:09,093
And I just had to put my foot
down there and I have done.

246
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:16,864
Jaipur, they said, "Mother you just put your foot here", really!

247
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:20,956
So for me the situation is very good in India.

248
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:24,064
Now let’s see what you people are going to do

249
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:28,443
with these big big Seminars and lectures.

250
00:21:28,643 --> 00:21:32,896
Why not get some outsiders to listen to you?

251
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:36,544
Invite them.

252
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:42,763
Invite these intellectuals.

253
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:49,690
Try to talk to them, tell them what is it.

254
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,433
What do you call them, those who know about Bible?

255
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:58,273
Theologics.

256
00:21:58,474 --> 00:22:04,618
Theologics, theo - what logians? Without logics!

257
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:06,516
Theologics.

258
00:22:06,716 --> 00:22:11,523
Call these Theologians, challenge them.

259
00:22:11,723 --> 00:22:16,996
Why not put a challenge?

260
00:22:18,413 --> 00:22:23,866
You are not alone, you are so many.

261
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,872
And don’t tell them that you wear saris when you come for my Puja.

262
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:37,646
They won’t understand it, they are not that deep.

263
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:42,696
You can wear your jeans.

264
00:22:42,897 --> 00:22:48,775
Or to convince them more, you can be punks.

265
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:55,363
That would appeal to them better. You go with your punky conditions,

266
00:22:55,564 --> 00:23:02,062
they will jolly well have to listen to you, otherwise they are in for trouble.

267
00:23:05,156 --> 00:23:07,779
If they are that stupid, why not handle them?

268
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:12,313
It is very easy to handle a stupid person than to handle a person

269
00:23:12,513 --> 00:23:16,329
who is not stupid, or who is clever.

270
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:23,672
Stupid can be stupefied very easily.

271
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:28,880
So I think we have to change our course, we have to take it

272
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,816
in a big way, the whole thing, what we are going to do.

273
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:35,425
All of you should give some concrete ideas

274
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:40,128
as to what you would like to do.

275
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:44,184
And that would be really the way it will work out.

276
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,302
So now in the Seminar you must discuss more

277
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:53,133
how to talk to these people,

278
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:58,063
how to create a platform for Sahaja Yoga.

279
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:06,037
Find out how do they create a platform out of nothing, like these punks.

280
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,245
And once you do all these things,

281
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:18,544
you will be surprised that they will have to listen.

282
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:21,412
They will have to listen to you.

283
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:26,240
Now go full ahead. I am giving you all freedom, do what you want.

284
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,275
Except for telling them I am Adi Shakti,

285
00:24:29,475 --> 00:24:31,490
that they will not be able to digest,

286
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:34,837
that an Indian has now become the Adi Shakti.

287
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:40,824
They think now Adi Shakti has to be an English lady.

288
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:45,908
At least, French.

289
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:57,952
So don’t mention me. If you want you can,

290
00:24:58,152 --> 00:25:01,116
but don’t mention me as Guru or anything, but you should say:

291
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:04,458
"She is the lady who has shown us the way" or something like that,

292
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:08,591
not referring much to me, but to them.

293
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:11,435
I think you should go ahead with it and work it out,

294
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,867
because we have now had a lot of patience,

295
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:17,263
now all nonsense going around us, better tell them.

296
00:25:17,463 --> 00:25:22,695
Or are we going to allow all of them to go to hell direct?

297
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:28,092
Message of Easter. East, comes from East.

298
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:31,305
I don’t know why they call it Easter.

299
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:35,049
Have you ever thought of it?

300
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:39,057
Why do they call it a Worcester Sauce, I don’t know.

301
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:41,322
I don’t know why they call anything anything.

302
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:47,841
But Easter,

303
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:50,653
you can’t explain, you know.

304
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:54,497
Like "curved screen", you don't know.

305
00:25:54,697 --> 00:26:00,874
So I don't know, but Easter, it is coming from the East.

306
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:07,416
The wisdom has to come from the East, the
Resurrection has to come from the East,

307
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:11,767
whether they like it or not.

308
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:16,497
And that is the message of Easter today:

309
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:21,422
that let us give them the chance of resurrection

310
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,883
by talking to them, all of you.

311
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,080
Should make it a point, go and talk to people

312
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:30,846
who are in charge of theology, churches, Bibles.

313
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:34,546
Go and talk to them, tell them:"What are you doing? Are you mad?

314
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:37,994
Why you want to die? Why do you want to be sleep people.

315
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:43,293
You don’t know anything."

316
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:48,218
Another thing I would suggest that we should have regular classes,

317
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:50,921
to understand Sahaja Yoga properly.

318
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:54,066
I have seen some people who are Sahaja Yogis for years

319
00:26:54,266 --> 00:27:00,808
don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

320
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:03,402
Even in Bombay, people told that:

321
00:27:03,602 --> 00:27:07,593
"Some of the ladies are absolutely zero as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

322
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,808
They don’t understand what is Sahaja Yoga is,

323
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:14,520
they don’t understand what is - what are the chakras are.

324
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,169
They listen to your lecture, everything, and then like a bubble,

325
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,638
the whole thing disappears from their minds."

326
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,770
I don’t know who gave them these ideas, but they were quite shocked.

327
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,114
So let us have a class-like thing for Sahaja Yogis

328
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:30,812
to different topics and subjects, let us work it out.

329
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:35,406
Recently you must be knowing, there is a book going to be published by

330
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:39,480
Yogi Mahajan called ‘Gita Enlightened’ which is a very good book.

331
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,736
Of course, I mean, most of it, I have helped him, he has been with me and all that,

332
00:27:43,937 --> 00:27:47,517
but doesn’t matter, but he has understood
the subject. The other day they published

333
00:27:47,718 --> 00:27:51,101
a very beautiful book in Marathi.

334
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:54,780
One Suravkar, such a learned book he wrote

335
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,624
that in the light of Gyaneshwara, what is Sahaja Yoga.

336
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:05,102
And he has written it so well that anybody who is a theologian

337
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:09,603
or anything, like in India, will be impressed by it.

338
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:12,439
I wish I could translate that book for you.

339
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:18,320
But it is all the stanzas from Gyaneshwara,

340
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,059
which is in Marathi language. He
wrote such a nice book on Sahaja Yoga

341
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:26,499
and that is what he gave on my birthday this time,

342
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:31,788
something so substantial, I felt.

343
00:28:31,988 --> 00:28:35,369
And once it reaches into the hands of any one of these people,

344
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:41,015
I mean, it will in any case.

345
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,396
And he published himself, he brought some copies, gave it to me.

346
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:48,232
And all the copies were sold out in that programme,

347
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:53,486
every copy was sold out for Rs. 2 each.

348
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:58,352
So this is what we have to do now, is to write,

349
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:00,992
write to different magazines, meet people,

350
00:29:01,192 --> 00:29:03,266
tell them we want to come and talk to you.

351
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,875
First of all you must know about Sahaja Yoga.

352
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:08,075
You should be well equipped.

353
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:12,164
It’s not that you can show my photograph with a light here.

354
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:17,995
That is not sufficient. What is the light here, also you have to show.

355
00:29:18,195 --> 00:29:20,429
Only a few people know what is Sahaja Yoga,

356
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,893
the rest of you don't know anything.

357
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:27,294
Let us see what questions we have in our minds.

358
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:32,810
Let us sit down and find out: "What are the questions?"

359
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,083
"What questions are we lacking in?"

360
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:38,258
"What we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga? What part we don’t know?"

361
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:42,215
Let’s find out all those things, all the details. Let us write it down.

362
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:47,261
Everyone of you. Whether it’s a woman, man, child, everyone can do it.

363
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:50,175
Find out: "What are the questions

364
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:53,367
which are not yet answered in Sahaja Yoga?"

365
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:57,937
"How can we answer particular questions?"

366
00:29:58,137 --> 00:30:00,695
Alright? All these things can be found out.

367
00:30:00,895 --> 00:30:04,734
If you put your attention to it, you can easily find out what you need.

368
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:08,406
Everyone has to do it. You must all be equipped.

369
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,774
If anybody asks you a question on Sahaja Yoga

370
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:14,829
and you cannot answer, I mean, how can you convince people?

371
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:19,282
You take one ordinary so-called layman from Christianity,

372
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,482
so-called Christianity again,

373
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:25,754
the man is layman and the Christianity is also lay.

374
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:30,577
He will give you a big lecture on Christ.

375
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:33,358
Every verse in the Bible, he will tell you:

376
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:39,382
"Chapters, Matthew 2, Verse 2, this is what Christ has said.

377
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:43,048
That "you will be calling me Christ, Christ and I will not recognise you",

378
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:48,850
telling about himself only.

379
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,653
So you have to be absolutely equipped for it.

380
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:58,239
Now you have to also know what you will confront

381
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,997
in a particular country. For example, when I come to England,

382
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:05,722
I know I have to confront these theologians and the Christ and everything.

383
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:08,431
If I go to India, what I have to confront I know.

384
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:14,975
I have to face it on different lines and different fronts.

385
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:17,329
You don’t have to do that.

386
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,937
Just think about your own country. For French, you have to think

387
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:24,874
about France, you people have to think about this country.

388
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:27,074
And then go ahead with it.

389
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:31,228
You can chalk out a good programme and work it out properly.

390
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,640
I am sure, by God’s grace, everything will work out.

391
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,716
Because when I am going to do it now?

392
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:39,255
I’m going away, as I told you, to India,

393
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:42,333
and I don’t know when will I be back. You wanted to arrange

394
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:47,015
my programme in England, but I think I cannot do it,

395
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:49,836
because I have to go round to all the places, Europe and all that,

396
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:54,078
finish that. You’d better do that touring.

397
00:31:54,278 --> 00:32:01,120
When I was not here, what touring did you do?

398
00:32:03,195 --> 00:32:06,304
Nothing.

399
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:12,794
You could have toured. Now at least, these three months,

400
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:16,037
when we are having a nice summer time,

401
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:18,696
I’ll be travelling all over Europe, everywhere.

402
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,946
You please see that you go round England.

403
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:25,149
Visit different places, arrange programmes, talk to people,

404
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:28,066
find out who are the big Johnnies there.

405
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:34,808
The mayors, this, that, go and talk to them, tell them about this.

406
00:32:35,008 --> 00:32:38,320
That is how new programming should be done and a new dimension

407
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,068
should be given to our Sahaja Yoga propaganda.

408
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:46,356
You have done no propaganda in the right sense, in the sense that

409
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:49,809
we were not so much sure about it, that we’ll work out.

410
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,041
But now we will, because people are writing,

411
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:57,960
there is an atmosphere against Christ, so we have to fight.

412
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,249
And that is how we should become the people who are fighting for Christ.

413
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,361
Now there could be areas where you can talk of integration,

414
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:12,580
of talking about how we do not know much about Christ.

415
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,752
That we have to go to other books to find out who He was.

416
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,903
Why did He come on this earth? We have to go much deeper.

417
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:21,090
We have to prove that there is Divine power.

418
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,144
And you have seen how Divine power works, what wonders there are.

419
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:27,079
You take my photographs. Show them: "These are the photographs,

420
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,053
can you explain these things? That in the hand you see the sun?

421
00:33:31,254 --> 00:33:38,773
Show us in Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, even a star won’t twinkle."

422
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:45,182
These things are to be seen in the right perspective

423
00:33:45,382 --> 00:33:49,919
and at the right time. We must do whatever is right at that point.

424
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,126
That is the way Sahaja Yoga is.

425
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:56,908
Hit the point when it is to be hitten.

426
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:00,240
If you cannot do that way, you cannot achieve it.

427
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,268
So this is the right time for you, there are now

428
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:06,920
3 months ahead of you, I would like you to see what you can do,

429
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,906
because now the sun will be coming out,

430
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:14,312
you will have a nice summer.

431
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:17,968
Go ahead. But now just do not fix all your holidays

432
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,463
during these three months going to some beach somewhere.

433
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:26,987
Sahaja Yogis have no time. They are busy people.

434
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:30,858
They have no time to waste.

435
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:39,813
We are on a warpath, we have no time
to quarrel among ourselves, fight.

436
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:44,243
We have to fight very great enemies.

437
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,840
We have no time to waste on our families and our children

438
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,980
and our relations and father, mother, sister, brother.

439
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,902
We are on a warpath, very important it is.

440
00:34:56,102 --> 00:35:01,672
So let us now prepare ourselves.
As Christ stood out of that grave,

441
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:08,880
let us get out of this grave of lethargy, of compromising, of comfort,

442
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,593
of our past ideas about life’s pleasures.

443
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:21,905
This is the new era that has to show,

444
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:26,834
it’s manifestation in this country.

445
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,506
It is very important, and you all can do it.

446
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:33,517
You have to be very brave, you have to be sensible, wise,

447
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:37,000
kind and also forthright.

448
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,095
But you have to say what you have to say, because it has to be said.

449
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:45,298
And this is the only thing to be said, nothing else is important.

450
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:48,408
Whatever these people talk about has no meaning.

451
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,541
They are not mantras.

452
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:56,173
Some of them are anti-God, some may not be,

453
00:35:56,373 --> 00:36:00,666
but they are useless, wasteful, garbages I should say.

454
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:05,943
Why they are given so much importance and not the real thing that is there?

455
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:14,813
You understand that this is the reality that has come into you people.

456
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:18,649
Actually you have felt the reality.

457
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:22,457
Actually you know the reality,

458
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:28,422
you are in the reality, then why not talk about it?

459
00:36:30,227 --> 00:36:32,147
Why should we not?

460
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:37,788
Is it not the most important thing that we have to do?

461
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,741
If you realise it, I am sure it will work out.

462
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:44,775
With all my blessings, with all my love,

463
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,978
I really command you to do that now.

464
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:52,919
May God bless you.

465
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:59,370
Today, on this day you all should vow,

466
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:03,120
vow that "we are on the warpath and we are going to find out

467
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,385
ways and methods of doing these things,

468
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:10,646
for these three months, we are going to work it out". Just vow.

469
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:17,919
Just ask for wisdoms and the spiritual power, that’s all.

470
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:29,961
And promise it to Christ that "as You did, we are going to do".

471
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:46,430
May God bless you.
