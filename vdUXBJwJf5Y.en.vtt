00:00.000 --> 00:00.892
1978-0911 The Principle of Brahma, Caxton Hall, London

00:01.000 --> 00:10.892
Today I want to tell you about something, perhaps I have never touched that point before.

00:11.000 --> 00:26.892
Or I have not talked about it, that elaborately. It is about The Principle of Brahma:

00:27.000 --> 00:39.892
What is the principle of Brahma? How does It exist? How is It born? How does It manifest?

00:40.000 --> 00:59.892
And how, It is detached and also attached.

01:00.000 --> 01:16.892
The Principle of Brahma is different from Brahma Itself, in description.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.892
Like the principles that I follow, is different from what I am.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.892
It’s a very subtle subject and requires real meditative attention.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.892
So, all criticism of your minds, please put them off, as you have put off your shoes.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.892
Have you put off your shoes all of you? Please. And just listen with little, little subtler attention to Me.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.892
Can you come forward! You all can come forward so that those who will be coming later can come later on.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.892
Come along forward! I think better is to come forward, because we have no mic here.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.892
It’s better to come forward here.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.892
As the principles on which you are based are different from what you are,

02:40.000 --> 02:51.892
in the same way, the Principle of Brahma is different from the Brahma Itself,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.892
but is a Brahma and is contained in the Brahma.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.892
But the Brahma itself is sustained by the Principle.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.892
In dimension, you may say that Brahma is wider, larger

03:13.000 --> 03:26.892
and, you can call it even, deeper – but the subtler is the Principle.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.892
This Principle exists with Brahma at the beginning of The Universe, of Creation.

03:35.000 --> 03:43.892
At the very beginning, it exists, but as it is an eternal play of creation, destruction,

03:44.000 --> 03:54.892
sustenance in between, and in Sanskrit they call it sthiti: ‘state of performance’, you can call it.

03:55.000 --> 04:09.892
In all these three stages, Brahma Principle changes its forms according to the container that it has.

04:10.000 --> 04:25.892
Like here the light looks like, the shade looks like of the shape of the globe that is covering it.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.892
‘Looking like’ is the Maya, is the Illusion.

04:33.000 --> 04:47.892
Something that looks like something which it is not: this phenomenon is the Maya, is the Illusion.

04:48.000 --> 05:02.892
So the Principle acts, pulsates the Brahma, and in the Brahma exist all the Powers which, later on,

05:03.000 --> 05:28.892
manifest the Creation. So the Principle, which is the Divine Power, the aura of that,

05:29.000 --> 05:38.892
or the thing that it sustains is the complete Brahma and that Brahma has got three powers,

05:39.000 --> 05:56.892
namely – one of existence, second of creation, third of sustenance.

05:57.000 --> 06:18.892
The Principle is the pulsating power of the Brahma. And it is represented as Om.

06:19.000 --> 06:29.892
When we say, “Om”, this was used also in the Christian prayer as “Amen”, it’s the same as Om,

06:30.000 --> 06:52.892
there’s no difference. When we say, “Om,” actually the action of this Principle is in the form of Om,

06:53.000 --> 07:05.892
like this, which is written on your forehead, if you can see it inside, in that way, here.

07:06.000 --> 07:25.892
This Principle is the, we can say, the fetus. This Principle is the fetus of the Divine Power.

07:26.000 --> 07:40.892
Then the same Principle, or you can call, the seed, then it divides into three channels

07:41.000 --> 07:51.892
and enters into the creative, sustaining and the existing power of the Brahma Tattwa

07:52.000 --> 07:57.892
and manifests in it – we haven’t got anything to write, otherwise I could show you.

07:58.000 --> 08:15.892
But it permeates, just like the rivers flow and permeate in the soil and nourish it, in the same way,

08:16.000 --> 08:36.892
this Principle of Brahma flows, permeates, pulsates and nourishes the surrounding area of Brahma.

08:37.000 --> 08:45.892
So, when the Attention, which you call as Maha Chitta,

08:46.000 --> 09:10.892
or the Attention of God, you can call it, is on this Principle, then Brahma doesn’t see it.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.892
Are you following it?

09:17.000 --> 09:28.892
When the Attention [of God Almighty] moves from the Principle, It doesn’t leave It.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.892
When the river flows, it doesn’t leave its source.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.892
When It permeates into the Brahma, It starts creating.

09:44.000 --> 09:55.892
This principle is detached, as the light or the electricity inside this globe is detached.

09:56.000 --> 10:10.892
But it permeates. It may permeate through it, it may permeate into this room but still it is detached.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.892
I wouldn’t say there could be any proper simile for Brahma because that’s an absolute stuff

10:17.000 --> 10:26.892
and an absolute cannot be compared; as they call it ‘atula’, it cannot be compared with anything.

10:27.000 --> 10:36.892
So now people think then, “What is God?” Question comes in.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.892
“Where is God? What is He? What has He got to do with Brahma

10:43.000 --> 10:52.892
and the Principle that is Brahma?”

10:53.000 --> 11:08.892
God is The Principle, He is the Attention, He is the Joy and He is the Truth.

11:09.000 --> 11:25.892
And the Brahma that surrounds Him is His power, permeated, enlightened by His existence.

11:26.000 --> 11:34.892
The same Brahma has got a capacity to get itself transformed

11:35.000 --> 11:48.892
into the creative, sustaining and the, you call it, existing or destructive powers.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.892
We can see a small little seed, how it manifests a tree.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.892
We never think – from where do the shoots come out, from where does the root comes out,

12:02.000 --> 12:10.892
what creates the flowers, what gives it the fragrance – for the seeds do not have any fragrance.

12:11.000 --> 12:18.892
But there is definitely a mechanism, which is very microscopic, inside the seed, placed there.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.892
And seed is the form where there is no movement, no manifestation, no creation.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.892
In the same way Brahma can be in seed form.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.892
So, the sustaining power within us or the creative power within us,

12:41.000 --> 12:51.892
or, what you call, the destructive power or the left-side power – which we call as the astitwa –

12:52.000 --> 12:58.892
is the existing power, all these are manifested by Principle of Brahma

12:59.000 --> 13:06.892
but by themselves they are nothing.

13:07.000 --> 13:17.892
So Sat-Chit-Ananda, the Truth, the Joy and the Attention,

13:18.000 --> 13:32.892
the nature of Brahma, which is this, is God. “Why, what is Shakti then?”

13:33.000 --> 13:51.892
The question comes in. The Shakti is the complete Brahma plus the Power of God.

13:52.000 --> 14:00.892
Like the cotyledons in the seed, the primule in the seed, the cotyledons support it.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.892
Through the cotyledons, the primule takes all the powers and creates beautiful flowers

14:09.000 --> 14:21.892
and all the beautiful fruits. The roots also are created. The food is given by cotyledons:

14:22.000 --> 14:28.892
it sustains them. Out of this, the principle that does it, the generating power,

14:29.000 --> 14:39.892
the germinating power that is in it, is the power that we call as the Shakti.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.892
But in a seed, which is a material thing, it has no awareness to do it.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.892
It’s a very subtle point, try to understand it. The seed itself cannot germinate itself.

14:56.000 --> 15:04.892
It has certain other power within it, which is placed by God that germinates it.

15:05.000 --> 15:19.892
It cannot do by itself. That power is the God in the seed and also in the ground.

15:20.000 --> 15:32.892
The germinating power is the Shakti, that power which makes it do it but the seed is not aware of it.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.892
When you reach to the human stage, you have to know that Power,

15:41.000 --> 15:48.892
and you have to be aware of that Power, and that is Self-realisation.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.892
The Power that has created you, The Power that has given you all these three powers:

15:57.000 --> 16:12.892
Ida Nadi, Pingala Nadi, all Kundalini, everything – The One which is the desire of all that.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.892
We can take a simile just to understand it.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.892
The owner of the house…I hope it will work out but, sometimes, you know how human minds are confused.

16:27.000 --> 16:39.892
Supposing the owner of the house walks into the house with his money

16:40.000 --> 16:52.892
and creates everything that he wants to do about his house.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.892
Now the master goes out, he’s not there. When you see, you see a house created,

17:01.000 --> 17:07.892
you see the power of all the workmen who have done the job,

17:08.000 --> 17:18.892
and somebody who has established everything. But you don’t know whose desire it has created.

17:19.000 --> 17:23.892
In the same way, you have seen your body being created,

17:24.000 --> 17:32.892
you even see the mind that is you have got, you can see your emotions, they are there, of course.

17:33.000 --> 17:42.892
You can also see you are a human being. You can also see you are much far away from the animals.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.892
And if you have some wisdom, you understand also you are much wiser

17:47.000 --> 17:54.892
than anything that is created so far. And also, if you have some foresight.

18:10.000 --> 18:17.892
But the power of desiring, desiring power or we can say the projecting power

18:18.000 --> 18:23.892
or the one who is the owner of all that, the owning power,

18:24.000 --> 18:38.892
I mean, I don’t know how you understand the master of the whole thing. He is the God.

18:39.000 --> 18:49.892
And then His Power of Desire – Mahakali’s power, is His Desire – then manifests everything else.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.892
His desire, He manifests. His Mahakali’s power that you see here on the left-hand side

18:57.000 --> 19:03.892
is manifested in the human being as Ida Nadi. [It] creates all the rest of the Universe

19:04.000 --> 19:08.892
and everything later on. But first is only the desire.

19:09.000 --> 19:23.892
But the One who desires is the God. In us, He is placed in our heart away from all this filth.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.892
And He just desires. We do not know Him but He knows us.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.892
We know one thing, definitely, that He knows us.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.892
There is Someone who is definitely watching us, as in the [Bhagavad] Gita, they say Kshetr Agnya,

19:41.000 --> 19:46.892
the One who is the knower of the field. The Knower of the field is there.

19:47.000 --> 19:55.892
Once you also become the knower of your field, you are Self-realised: this is Self-realisation.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.892
When people talk about Self-realisation cheaply! I’m really shocked.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.892
The way people have taken into their hands, such a revered subject

20:12.000 --> 20:20.892
and just try to mould it for making money! Just think of it! From that level to this level,

20:21.000 --> 20:26.892
it’s a bit too much! I mean, this, only human beings can do, I can tell you.

20:27.000 --> 20:33.892
Nobody can do like this but human beings. Even if they are rakshasas they know

20:34.000 --> 20:43.892
that this is Divine Power and you cannot misuse it by any chance!

20:44.000 --> 20:56.892
So this Principle works, say, in a… in the matter it works.

20:57.000 --> 21:04.892
As the electromagnetic force, you can say. But not as the electromagnetic force,

21:05.000 --> 21:14.892
it works which brings about the electromagnetic force inside that. Can you follow the point?

21:15.000 --> 21:26.892
Do you? Say, here is electricity, but the one who sends the electricity is The Person

21:27.000 --> 21:35.892
and He’s aware of it. Till you reach the stage of Self-realisation you are not aware of it,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.892
you cannot control it, you cannot work it out. It works by Itself,

21:41.000 --> 21:48.892
and that’s why the doctors call it as autonomous nervous system, and the psychologists as unconscious.

21:49.000 --> 22:02.892
After Realisation only, the whole thing becomes your own, in the sense – you change sides.

22:03.000 --> 22:15.892
So far you have been looking things from there, now you sit with Me and see the whole story.

22:16.000 --> 22:27.892
But this Principle of Brahma lives in this mood. It can be in such a mood

22:28.000 --> 22:35.892
that it has no duty at all, it has no duty, it just exists. It has no duty.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.892
It is not the duty of a owner of a house to do something about it.

22:41.000 --> 22:50.892
It is His whim: if He wants to do it, He’ll do it, otherwise He’ll live like a hermit. He has no duties.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.892
I hope you understand the meaning of “the owner,” because the human laws are funny.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.892
Whatever you may be the owner, still you can’t do many things.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.892
But if you can think of an absolute owner of this place, absolute owner…

23:07.000 --> 23:11.892
Yes, very true, you’re smiling, but in Oxted we had a freehold house [but] we couldn’t cut the tree,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.892
we couldn’t plant the tree, we couldn’t do this to the hedge, you couldn’t do that.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.892
But He is an absolute owner, absolute owner. Understand the ‘absolute’ word!

23:22.000 --> 23:33.892
Where no law, but His own laws work out.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.892
His laws operate. Nobody’s laws can reach Him.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.892
Then you may say, the question comes in, “Then how is it Mother, it is said that,

23:46.000 --> 23:55.892
‘We are free, freedom has been given to us?” Only the freedom is so far as to choose Him:

23:56.000 --> 24:00.892
for your betterment, you are not going to better Him.

24:01.000 --> 24:06.892
You are not going to better Sahaja Yoga by coming to Sahaja Yoga, you are sadly mistaken

24:07.000 --> 24:21.892
[if you think that]. No! Sahaja Yoga has no duties. It’s a whim. It has no problems.

24:22.000 --> 24:29.892
It is standing on Its own mastery; It’s not bothered whether you come here or go away.

24:30.000 --> 24:40.892
It It is nishprayojana [aimless], It is without any prayojana: cause.

24:41.000 --> 24:47.892
It The cause: It is causeless; It’s not bothered.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.892
It So, It has to take a form in which It has to bother.

24:53.000 --> 25:04.892
It Then It creates, like a master of a house need not bother about anything.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.892
It He’s the master, who’s going to criticise Him? Who is going to argue with Him?

25:09.000 --> 25:12.892
Who is going to challenge Him? Who is going to put a quota against Him?

25:13.000 --> 25:17.892
He’s the Master of everything! Absolute Master! God, means, He is not only Almighty,

25:18.000 --> 25:22.892
but He’s the Master of all that He has created. He is the master, if He wants, He will do it,

25:23.000 --> 25:32.892
otherwise He will not do it. It is His whim that He has done it.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.892
So, He’s not bothered, but then He takes a form,

25:39.000 --> 25:45.892
sometimes, of a person who wants to do something. He wants to bother,

25:46.000 --> 25:58.892
just as a whim He bothers Himself and He starts creating. And He creates.

25:59.000 --> 26:05.892
And He creates this Universe and He creates you.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.892
He creates because He wants to see it with many eyes – what He has done.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.892
So he creates His own children, grows them up, gives them eyes

26:21.000 --> 26:27.892
so that they can enjoy what He has got. He gives them their power to see.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.892
This essence of Brahma is the Ganga Tattwa: as, in the Sanskrit, He is called as the Ganga Principle.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.892
From here [Mooladhara], we have to understand that is the first principle

26:41.000 --> 26:47.892
and that is the principle of innocence. That is a principle of holiness,

26:48.000 --> 26:52.892
that is a principle of chastity within us.

26:53.000 --> 27:03.892
That is the principle by which we preserve ourself, by which we respect ourselves.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.892
That principle has been incarnated on this earth, as I have told you.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.892
He’s created as Ganesha but He’s incarnated as Jesus Christ. He’s the Brahma Tattwa.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.892
He’s detached and that’s why He could be resurrected.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.892
No other incarnation could be resurrected.

27:24.000 --> 27:33.892
He was not born, it was a conception, a desire. And that’s why He was resurrected.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.892
You all, perhaps do not know that what is difficult for God?

27:41.000 --> 27:45.892
I mean, for an Indian it is very easy to understand that Ganesha was created by Parvati,

27:46.000 --> 27:51.892
Yes! She created Him. We can never doubt it, because He’s God after all.

27:52.000 --> 28:03.892
He is an absolute personality. He can do whatever He likes.

28:04.000 --> 28:11.892
Of course, He does something that is intelligible to your mind, tries to.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.892
But if He has done something which is not intelligible to you,

28:16.000 --> 28:25.892
it should not be discarded as something mythological, or something out of the blue,

28:26.000 --> 28:32.892
not to be believed. Because if you say that, then are you the most absolute people to judge Him?

28:41.000 --> 28:46.892
Let us know that we are not, we are not, but we have to be!

28:47.000 --> 28:51.892
He wants you to be aware of Him

28:52.000 --> 28:57.892
And in this creation, when He creates, He creates Himself into a One Primordial Being.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.892
He becomes that, He assumes that position of being the One Primordial Being.

29:05.000 --> 29:12.892
And then He selects His cells which have to play an important role which are to be awakened.

29:13.000 --> 29:19.892
Now the brain cells are the ones which are aware. Have you ever thought,

29:20.000 --> 29:28.892
that – how these brain cells know? How, how come… everything…?

29:29.000 --> 29:33.892
This little boy asked Me this question, because he’s very much there,

29:34.000 --> 29:44.892
but very few people ask this question: “How there is gravity? Why this becomes red?

29:45.000 --> 29:56.892
Why that becomes green? How it has happened? Who has done it?”

29:57.000 --> 30:00.892
We take things for granted, everything for granted.

30:01.000 --> 30:08.892
That’s the only trouble with human beings, taking everything for granted.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.892
If we do not take for granted everything and just in all humility say that,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.892
“O Lord, we know very little about You, we’d like to know,”

30:20.000 --> 30:24.892
He takes you up and makes you sit in His brain,

30:25.000 --> 30:34.892
so that you become aware of the powers of His brain, of His heart, from where He loves you,

30:35.000 --> 30:40.892
where He is the ocean of compassion, you become a drop in that Ocean.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.892
And you, also, with your waves, you jump up and down and enjoy that compassion of His.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.892
Just a drop you are, but you are the Ocean.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.892
This is what explains what Kabira says. You see, these great people have described Him

30:58.000 --> 31:02.892
but it becomes absolutely ambiguous for you.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.892
The human rationality cannot explain all these things.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.892
So, your rationality has to improve onto vibratory awareness.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.892
You have to go through that level, minimum of minimum, to understand God.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.892
You cannot understand Him at this level.

31:19.000 --> 31:30.892
So don’t come out here with ideas that you are going to give something to God, no!

31:31.000 --> 31:40.892
You have to take; you cannot give anything to Him. But in your humility,

31:41.000 --> 31:45.892
if you express yourself, He likes it.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.892
The Master loves when a little child brings some flowers for him.

31:51.000 --> 31:59.892
When a little baby brings, say, flowers for the Mother, the Mother likes it.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.892
Not ‘likes’, but in Sanskrit there’s a word, ‘kautupa’. I don’t know, there’s no word in English for that,

32:06.000 --> 32:14.892
I am sorry. ‘Kautupa’ is the happiness, the joy that one feels when he sees this child come up,

32:15.000 --> 32:20.892
when the person sees the child returning the love in its small way.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.892
After all children are – what are they going to do, you see?

32:24.000 --> 32:28.892
Like this one, you see, one day he brought 2p for me. He says, “Grandmother,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.892
you can buy a sari with this, yes, you’d better keep it with you.” You see, he found it somewhere,

32:33.000 --> 32:38.892
he said, “I haven’t earned it, but I’ve got for you, so you can keep it and buy a sari.”

32:39.000 --> 32:45.892
Then the feelings that come into mind, there’s the kautupa.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.892
The feeling that comes within at that time in a Mother’s heart, is the kautupa,

32:53.000 --> 33:02.892
the sweetness of that, the beauty of that. You cannot understand by your dry rationality,

33:03.000 --> 33:09.892
it can make you parched, completely. It has no feelings, it has no sensitivity, nothing.

33:10.000 --> 33:17.892
O God, this ego, I tell you this so-called ego, has really parched human beings completely

33:18.000 --> 33:23.892
of all the beautiful things that have been flowing in them, all the sensitivity.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.892
And horrible books and horrible things that people have taught you have really finished

33:29.000 --> 33:35.892
all that’s beautiful that was within you. Such beautiful flowers were created

33:36.000 --> 33:41.892
with such beautiful fragrance to be emitted, have been parched completely,

33:42.000 --> 33:48.892
I feel, by this foolish ego of human beings which is so limited.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.892
It was given to you just to understand a few things but you have covered yourself completely

33:56.000 --> 34:08.892
with that mud and it’s such a difficult thing I find, such a difficult thing.

34:09.000 --> 34:16.892
Some examples can be given. A boy came to see Me, the other day,

34:17.000 --> 34:22.892
with a friend who is a very great Sahaja Yogi, I must say. He’s not here today.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.892
And he is, I would say, just to please the Sahaja Yogi I said, “All right, I’ll take him out.”

34:30.000 --> 34:34.892
Found the boy had a terrible guilt within him, because he had done something horrible,

34:35.000 --> 34:40.892
absolutely horrid. But I told him that, “You have a guilt and it’s forgiven, so give it up.

34:41.000 --> 34:47.892
Try it, try it.” But nothing works out with him, so egoistical,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.892
so egoistical; and such a small thing he was. I mean,

34:51.000 --> 34:55.892
if he was anywhere near the Truth, I would have understood also that he thinks

34:56.000 --> 34:59.892
that he should get it or do it and all that. But nothing of the kind.

35:00.000 --> 35:08.892
He goes back and tells this Sahaja Yogi, “Oh, I think She is just a ordinary housewife, that’s all,

35:09.000 --> 35:15.892
don’t take Her seriously.” Then the Sahaja Yogi said,

35:16.000 --> 35:21.892
“Oh, really, what a business! How many people have you cured?

35:22.000 --> 35:28.892
I have seen people suffering from cancer even, cured by Her. I have seen, with my own eyes,

35:29.000 --> 35:34.892
Kundalini rising, I have seen people getting Realisation.

35:35.000 --> 35:44.892
There are so many I have seen with my own eyes. I have to disbelieve all that and believe you?”

35:45.000 --> 35:54.892
I never knew that he was that superficial. And this is his answer.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.892
But as I had told you that you can take the position when you are bothered.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.892
And when I take a position like that, that I am bothered about you,

36:05.000 --> 36:20.892
then I think that really you are still very, very ignorant. But at least see, at least ask for it,

36:21.000 --> 36:27.892
and it should be done because the creation has to be completed, it has to be fulfilled.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.892
And you have to know the meaning of your being, you have to know why God has created you

36:35.000 --> 36:41.892
and what are you. That is a must! People waste their time with this and that.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.892
There’s no time to be wasted any more I can tell you this much.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.892
In the West such a wastage of time I find. Same in the East is,

36:52.000 --> 36:59.892
they are doing what you have done before, like they are trying to build bridges

37:00.000 --> 37:06.892
and they are trying to do now underground trains.

37:07.000 --> 37:12.892
And those who have done it are now committing suicides.

37:13.000 --> 37:20.892
Between these two ends where do I stand sometimes, I start looking at My face.

37:21.000 --> 37:28.892
What should I do with these extremes that are there?

37:29.000 --> 37:35.892
So please also put your Mr. Ego outside with your shoes, so it will work out.

37:36.000 --> 37:44.892
If it does not work out, that’s not My concern, nor is My problem.

37:45.000 --> 37:56.892
It is your problem that it has not worked out. If an operation is not successful,

37:57.000 --> 38:03.892
then the doctor can be blamed because he takes money for it, but not Mataji.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.892
Not because I don’t take money, but I’m not bothered about it.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.892
I’m only bothered that you should get your realisation.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.892
But I’m not bothered if you have not got it. Can you understand that part?

38:21.000 --> 38:27.892
I will work morning till evening, evening till morning to give you realisation,

38:28.000 --> 38:34.892
but if you don’t want it, I’m not bothered, see. Neither if it does not work out,

38:35.000 --> 38:42.892
I am not bothered, it is a simple thing.

38:43.000 --> 38:51.892
This is the only difference between a mother on this earth and I, the Mother,

38:52.000 --> 39:03.892
who has to really give you the keys of your kingdom, the keys of your joy, the keys of your Truth:

39:04.000 --> 39:14.892
I have to do that. And I don’t give you by taking anything from you.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.892
This must be understood, because egoistical people immediately are on the guard.

39:21.000 --> 39:30.892
What have you got to give in Sahaja Yoga? I do not take anything from you. I give you,

39:31.000 --> 39:36.892
because I have got it with Me and you can have it, because that’s your right, so you better have it.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.892
But if you don’t want to have it, I am not going to force you.

39:43.000 --> 39:51.892
And then I play some tricks, which I must confess, because I’m not bothered.

39:52.000 --> 40:00.892
And with the tricks people disappear, reappear then disappear. So be careful on that point.

40:01.000 --> 40:10.892
This is the Principle of Brahma which is detached.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.892
The Principle of Brahma is detached, that acts and takes away the interest,

40:16.000 --> 40:21.892
the interest goes away, the attention goes away. You are not bothered about it.

40:22.000 --> 40:34.892
This Principle cannot be overcome. It is The Principle Itself. It cannot compromise,

40:35.000 --> 40:39.892
that’s the point, being absolute. Absolute things cannot compromise. For example,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.892
there are some people who may say… you see, there are some people who do say that,

40:44.000 --> 40:47.892
“Mataji says that you have to lead a dharmic life.”

40:48.000 --> 40:56.892
Indeed, you have to. I mean I cannot give realisation to Mr. Hitler if he comes to Me.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.892
There is something which cannot be compromised.

41:02.000 --> 41:10.892
You have to do something, you have to be in a position to receive it,

41:11.000 --> 41:23.892
and even if you receive it without that position, it can be worked out.

41:24.000 --> 41:43.892
It is also not the Principle that goes out of the way to demand something, no, it doesn’t.

41:44.000 --> 41:49.892
To a point only, but it won’t. But it is such a Living Principle,

41:50.000 --> 41:56.892
the beauty of Living Principle I will tell you. Which perhaps you know it but you do not know it.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.892
When the principle is dead, like say this house is built, it has got a foundation,

42:03.000 --> 42:07.892
then it is built up, then a house is brought in and then everything is done.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.892
Then once done is done. If the foundation is weak, it is weak forever, you cannot improve it.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.892
But the Living Principle is, whatever may be your foundation,

42:19.000 --> 42:22.892
it will penetrate into your foundations, into your backgrounds,

42:23.000 --> 42:31.892
into everything and can correct it completely. You just ask for it.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.892
Whatever may be your conditionings and whatever may be your guilts,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.892
whatever may be your problems, whatever sins you might have committed,

42:40.000 --> 42:45.892
whatever wrong things you might have done, the Living Principle can penetrate into it

42:46.000 --> 42:51.892
and can reform the whole thing and transform it into the fruit. You have seen it, in a tree,

42:52.000 --> 42:55.892
supposing a tree is sick, if you treat it, you completely can manifest the fruit.

42:56.000 --> 43:03.892
But if you vibrate it, then you see the whole beautiful stuff, becomes very beautiful.

43:04.000 --> 43:13.892
So, this is the Living Principle and that’s why Christ has said it, “I’m the living God.”

43:14.000 --> 43:22.892
This is the difference between the Living Principle which enlivens or awakens

43:23.000 --> 43:34.892
every part of your deadened chakras, every part of your deadened psyches.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.892
It awakens in you, it cures in you, it purifies in you,

43:41.000 --> 43:49.892
it absolutely neutralises all that is filth, dirt and ugliness, all that is called as sin. It doesn’t talk,

43:50.000 --> 44:00.892
it works out, but you have to just ask for it. Just ask the question.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.892
That’s the beauty of the Living Principle. That’s why, when people get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.892
don’t be surprised – it’s just a by-product, it’s nothing important.

44:11.000 --> 44:15.892
Even when the mad people become alright, nothing surprising, it’s just a by-product.

44:16.000 --> 44:22.892
Because it’s a Living Principle which penetrates into everything, it breaks every bit and bit of it, cures it,

44:23.000 --> 44:33.892
makes it alright, beautiful; makes it into a flower. And that is what is promised.

44:34.000 --> 44:40.892
But then people come down for Sahaja Yoga, “Mother, I have a problem.”

44:41.000 --> 44:46.892
I said, “Then what’s the problem?” “My friend has not written any letter to me, will You help me?”

44:47.000 --> 44:53.892
Now this is sometimes, puts Me down. It’s too much.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.892
It’s alright, even that can be solved, these problems.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.892
After all, a Mother has to solve these little, little problems of Her children.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.892
But ask for the Highest, “Twamekam sharenyam, twamekam varenyam –

45:11.000 --> 45:18.892
There is nothing to be asked for but for God.” Don’t ask other. The rest is all dust,

45:19.000 --> 45:25.892
is all that will finish off, is all chalayman : is coming and going, finished.

45:26.000 --> 45:34.892
Ask for the Eternal, ask for that is stable, ask for that is the Highest and the Purest.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.892
Don’t make Me come down to that. I play with you.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.892
When My child asks Me something, I have to tell him, “Alright, have it.”

45:45.000 --> 45:52.892
But when you mature you must ask for the Highest. Do not ask for a job and things.

45:53.000 --> 46:01.892
Alright, if you have a problem, it works, but you can understand now, from where to where.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.892
For today it’s al right because I’m bit too much in a Nishprayovens condition.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.892
And I was telling just now to these people, “I don’t know what I’m going to talk,”

46:14.000 --> 46:18.892
but I have taught something and if you have any questions, please ask Me.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.892
In the meanwhile, I would like some Sahaja Yogis to see these people

46:24.000 --> 46:28.892
and then we’ll go in for a meditation. I’ll have some water if there is some?

46:29.000 --> 46:41.892
Can you close that? Can you see these people now?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.892
No, just go and see one or two patients that are there.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.892
Tum logon ke hath me thanda ka aa raha kuch? Aisa rukh hath, aisa rukh. [Did you feel cool breeze?

46:48.000 --> 46:54.892
Hold your hands like this.] All of you should sit with hands like this. Better? How is he better?

46:55.000 --> 46:55.892
Hold your hands like this.] All of you should sit with hands like this. Better? How is he better?
