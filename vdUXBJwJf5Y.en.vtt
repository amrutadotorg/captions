00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.892
1978-0911 The Principle of Brahma, Caxton Hall, London

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.892
Today I want to tell you about something, perhaps I have never touched that point before. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:26.892
Or I have not talked about it, that elaborately. It is about The Principle of Brahma: 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.892
What is the principle of Brahma? How does It exist? How is It born? How does It manifest? 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:59.892
And how, It is detached and also attached.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:16.892
The Principle of Brahma is different from Brahma Itself, in description. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.892
Like the principles that I follow, is different from what I am.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.892
It’s a very subtle subject and requires real meditative attention. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.892
So, all criticism of your minds, please put them off, as you have put off your shoes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.892
Have you put off your shoes all of you? Please. And just listen with little, little subtler attention to Me. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.892
Can you come forward! You all can come forward so that those who will be coming later can come later on. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.892
Come along forward! I think better is to come forward, because we have no mic here. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.892
It’s better to come forward here.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.892
As the principles on which you are based are different from what you are, 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.892
in the same way, the Principle of Brahma is different from the Brahma Itself, 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.892
but is a Brahma and is contained in the Brahma. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.892
But the Brahma itself is sustained by the Principle. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.892
In dimension, you may say that Brahma is wider, larger 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.892
and, you can call it even, deeper – but the subtler is the Principle.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.892
This Principle exists with Brahma at the beginning of The Universe, of Creation. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.892
At the very beginning, it exists, but as it is an eternal play of creation, destruction, 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:54.892
sustenance in between, and in Sanskrit they call it sthiti: ‘state of performance’, you can call it.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:09.892
In all these three stages, Brahma Principle changes its forms according to the container that it has. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:25.892
Like here the light looks like, the shade looks like of the shape of the globe that is covering it. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.892
‘Looking like’ is the Maya, is the Illusion. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:47.892
Something that looks like something which it is not: this phenomenon is the Maya, is the Illusion.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:02.892
So the Principle acts, pulsates the Brahma, and in the Brahma exist all the Powers which, later on, 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:28.892
manifest the Creation. So the Principle, which is the Divine Power, the aura of that, 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.892
or the thing that it sustains is the complete Brahma and that Brahma has got three powers, 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:56.892
namely – one of existence, second of creation, third of sustenance.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:18.892
The Principle is the pulsating power of the Brahma. And it is represented as Om. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:29.892
When we say, “Om”, this was used also in the Christian prayer as “Amen”, it’s the same as Om, 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:52.892
there’s no difference. When we say, “Om,” actually the action of this Principle is in the form of Om, 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.892
like this, which is written on your forehead, if you can see it inside, in that way, here.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:25.892
This Principle is the, we can say, the fetus. This Principle is the fetus of the Divine Power. 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:40.892
Then the same Principle, or you can call, the seed, then it divides into three channels 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.892
and enters into the creative, sustaining and the existing power of the Brahma Tattwa 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.892
and manifests in it – we haven’t got anything to write, otherwise I could show you. 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:15.892
But it permeates, just like the rivers flow and permeate in the soil and nourish it, in the same way,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:36.892
this Principle of Brahma flows, permeates, pulsates and nourishes the surrounding area of Brahma.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.892
So, when the Attention, which you call as Maha Chitta, 

00:08:46.000 --> 00:09:10.892
or the Attention of God, you can call it, is on this Principle, then Brahma doesn’t see it. 

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.892
Are you following it? 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:28.892
When the Attention [of God Almighty] moves from the Principle, It doesn’t leave It. 

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.892
When the river flows, it doesn’t leave its source. 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.892
When It permeates into the Brahma, It starts creating.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.892
This principle is detached, as the light or the electricity inside this globe is detached. 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:10.892
But it permeates. It may permeate through it, it may permeate into this room but still it is detached. 

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.892
I wouldn’t say there could be any proper simile for Brahma because that’s an absolute stuff 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.892
and an absolute cannot be compared; as they call it ‘atula’, it cannot be compared with anything.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:36.892
So now people think then, “What is God?” Question comes in. 

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.892
“Where is God? What is He? What has He got to do with Brahma 

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:52.892
and the Principle that is Brahma?” 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:08.892
God is The Principle, He is the Attention, He is the Joy and He is the Truth. 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:25.892
And the Brahma that surrounds Him is His power, permeated, enlightened by His existence.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.892
The same Brahma has got a capacity to get itself transformed 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:48.892
into the creative, sustaining and the, you call it, existing or destructive powers.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.892
We can see a small little seed, how it manifests a tree. 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.892
We never think – from where do the shoots come out, from where does the root comes out, 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.892
what creates the flowers, what gives it the fragrance – for the seeds do not have any fragrance. 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.892
But there is definitely a mechanism, which is very microscopic, inside the seed, placed there. 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.892
And seed is the form where there is no movement, no manifestation, no creation. 

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.892
In the same way Brahma can be in seed form.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.892
So, the sustaining power within us or the creative power within us, 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:51.892
or, what you call, the destructive power or the left-side power – which we call as the astitwa – 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.892
is the existing power, all these are manifested by Principle of Brahma 

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.892
but by themselves they are nothing.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:17.892
So Sat-Chit-Ananda, the Truth, the Joy and the Attention, 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:32.892
the nature of Brahma, which is this, is God. “Why, what is Shakti then?” 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:51.892
The question comes in. The Shakti is the complete Brahma plus the Power of God.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.892
Like the cotyledons in the seed, the primule in the seed, the cotyledons support it. 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.892
Through the cotyledons, the primule takes all the powers and creates beautiful flowers 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:21.892
and all the beautiful fruits. The roots also are created. The food is given by cotyledons: 

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.892
it sustains them. Out of this, the principle that does it, the generating power, 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.892
the germinating power that is in it, is the power that we call as the Shakti.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.892
But in a seed, which is a material thing, it has no awareness to do it. 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.892
It’s a very subtle point, try to understand it. The seed itself cannot germinate itself. 

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.892
It has certain other power within it, which is placed by God that germinates it. 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:19.892
It cannot do by itself. That power is the God in the seed and also in the ground. 

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:32.892
The germinating power is the Shakti, that power which makes it do it but the seed is not aware of it.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.892
When you reach to the human stage, you have to know that Power, 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.892
and you have to be aware of that Power, and that is Self-realisation. 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.892
The Power that has created you, The Power that has given you all these three powers: 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:12.892
Ida Nadi, Pingala Nadi, all Kundalini, everything – The One which is the desire of all that.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.892
We can take a simile just to understand it. 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.892
The owner of the house…I hope it will work out but, sometimes, you know how human minds are confused. 

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:39.892
Supposing the owner of the house walks into the house with his money 

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:52.892
and creates everything that he wants to do about his house. 

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.892
Now the master goes out, he’s not there. When you see, you see a house created, 

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.892
you see the power of all the workmen who have done the job, 

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.892
and somebody who has established everything. But you don’t know whose desire it has created.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.892
In the same way, you have seen your body being created, 

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.892
you even see the mind that is you have got, you can see your emotions, they are there, of course. 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.892
You can also see you are a human being. You can also see you are much far away from the animals. 

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.892
And if you have some wisdom, you understand also you are much wiser 

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.892
than anything that is created so far. And also, if you have some foresight.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.892
But the power of desiring, desiring power or we can say the projecting power 

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.892
or the one who is the owner of all that, the owning power, 

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:38.892
I mean, I don’t know how you understand the master of the whole thing. He is the God. 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:49.892
And then His Power of Desire – Mahakali’s power, is His Desire – then manifests everything else. 

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.892
His desire, He manifests. His Mahakali’s power that you see here on the left-hand side 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.892
is manifested in the human being as Ida Nadi. [It] creates all the rest of the Universe 

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.892
and everything later on. But first is only the desire.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:23.892
But the One who desires is the God. In us, He is placed in our heart away from all this filth. 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.892
And He just desires. We do not know Him but He knows us. 

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.892
We know one thing, definitely, that He knows us. 

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.892
There is Someone who is definitely watching us, as in the [Bhagavad] Gita, they say Kshetr Agnya, 

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.892
the One who is the knower of the field. The Knower of the field is there.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.892
Once you also become the knower of your field, you are Self-realised: this is Self-realisation.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.892
When people talk about Self-realisation cheaply! I’m really shocked. 

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.892
The way people have taken into their hands, such a revered subject 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.892
and just try to mould it for making money! Just think of it! From that level to this level, 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.892
it’s a bit too much! I mean, this, only human beings can do, I can tell you. 

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.892
Nobody can do like this but human beings. Even if they are rakshasas they know 

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.892
that this is Divine Power and you cannot misuse it by any chance!

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:56.892
So this Principle works, say, in a… in the matter it works. 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.892
As the electromagnetic force, you can say. But not as the electromagnetic force, 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.892
it works which brings about the electromagnetic force inside that. Can you follow the point? 

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:26.892
Do you? Say, here is electricity, but the one who sends the electricity is The Person 

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.892
and He’s aware of it. Till you reach the stage of Self-realisation you are not aware of it, 

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.892
you cannot control it, you cannot work it out. It works by Itself, 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.892
and that’s why the doctors call it as autonomous nervous system, and the psychologists as unconscious. 

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:02.892
After Realisation only, the whole thing becomes your own, in the sense – you change sides. 

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:15.892
So far you have been looking things from there, now you sit with Me and see the whole story.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:27.892
But this Principle of Brahma lives in this mood. It can be in such a mood 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.892
that it has no duty at all, it has no duty, it just exists. It has no duty. 

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.892
It is not the duty of a owner of a house to do something about it. 

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:50.892
It is His whim: if He wants to do it, He’ll do it, otherwise He’ll live like a hermit. He has no duties.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.892
I hope you understand the meaning of “the owner,” because the human laws are funny. 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.892
Whatever you may be the owner, still you can’t do many things. 

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.892
But if you can think of an absolute owner of this place, absolute owner…

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.892
Yes, very true, you’re smiling, but in Oxted we had a freehold house [but] we couldn’t cut the tree, 

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.892
we couldn’t plant the tree, we couldn’t do this to the hedge, you couldn’t do that.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.892
But He is an absolute owner, absolute owner. Understand the ‘absolute’ word! 

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:33.892
Where no law, but His own laws work out. 

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.892
His laws operate. Nobody’s laws can reach Him.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.892
Then you may say, the question comes in, “Then how is it Mother, it is said that, 

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.892
‘We are free, freedom has been given to us?” Only the freedom is so far as to choose Him: 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.892
for your betterment, you are not going to better Him. 

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.892
You are not going to better Sahaja Yoga by coming to Sahaja Yoga, you are sadly mistaken 

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:21.892
[if you think that]. No! Sahaja Yoga has no duties. It’s a whim. It has no problems. 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.892
It is standing on Its own mastery; It’s not bothered whether you come here or go away. 

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:40.892
It It is nishprayojana [aimless], It is without any prayojana: cause. 

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.892
It The cause: It is causeless; It’s not bothered.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.892
It So, It has to take a form in which It has to bother. 

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:04.892
It Then It creates, like a master of a house need not bother about anything. 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.892
It He’s the master, who’s going to criticise Him? Who is going to argue with Him? 

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.892
Who is going to challenge Him? Who is going to put a quota against Him? 

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.892
He’s the Master of everything! Absolute Master! God, means, He is not only Almighty, 

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.892
but He’s the Master of all that He has created. He is the master, if He wants, He will do it, 

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.892
otherwise He will not do it. It is His whim that He has done it.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.892
So, He’s not bothered, but then He takes a form, 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.892
sometimes, of a person who wants to do something. He wants to bother, 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:58.892
just as a whim He bothers Himself and He starts creating. And He creates. 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.892
And He creates this Universe and He creates you. 

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.892
He creates because He wants to see it with many eyes – what He has done. 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.892
So he creates His own children, grows them up, gives them eyes 

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.892
so that they can enjoy what He has got. He gives them their power to see.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.892
This essence of Brahma is the Ganga Tattwa: as, in the Sanskrit, He is called as the Ganga Principle.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.892
From here [Mooladhara], we have to understand that is the first principle 

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.892
and that is the principle of innocence. That is a principle of holiness, 

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.892
that is a principle of chastity within us. 

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:03.892
That is the principle by which we preserve ourself, by which we respect ourselves. 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.892
That principle has been incarnated on this earth, as I have told you. 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.892
He’s created as Ganesha but He’s incarnated as Jesus Christ. He’s the Brahma Tattwa. 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.892
He’s detached and that’s why He could be resurrected. 

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.892
No other incarnation could be resurrected. 

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:33.892
He was not born, it was a conception, a desire. And that’s why He was resurrected.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.892
You all, perhaps do not know that what is difficult for God? 

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.892
I mean, for an Indian it is very easy to understand that Ganesha was created by Parvati, 

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.892
Yes! She created Him. We can never doubt it, because He’s God after all. 

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:03.892
He is an absolute personality. He can do whatever He likes. 

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:11.892
Of course, He does something that is intelligible to your mind, tries to. 

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.892
But if He has done something which is not intelligible to you, 

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:25.892
it should not be discarded as something mythological, or something out of the blue, 

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.892
not to be believed. Because if you say that, then are you the most absolute people to judge Him? 

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.892
Let us know that we are not, we are not, but we have to be! 

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.892
He wants you to be aware of Him

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.892
And in this creation, when He creates, He creates Himself into a One Primordial Being. 

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.892
He becomes that, He assumes that position of being the One Primordial Being. 

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.892
And then He selects His cells which have to play an important role which are to be awakened.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.892
Now the brain cells are the ones which are aware. Have you ever thought, 

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:28.892
that – how these brain cells know? How, how come… everything…?  

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.892
This little boy asked Me this question, because he’s very much there, 

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:44.892
but very few people ask this question: “How there is gravity? Why this becomes red? 

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:56.892
Why that becomes green? How it has happened? Who has done it?”

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.892
We take things for granted, everything for granted. 

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.892
That’s the only trouble with human beings, taking everything for granted. 

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.892
If we do not take for granted everything and just in all humility say that, 

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.892
“O Lord, we know very little about You, we’d like to know,” 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.892
He takes you up and makes you sit in His brain, 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:34.892
so that you become aware of the powers of His brain, of His heart, from where He loves you, 

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.892
where He is the ocean of compassion, you become a drop in that Ocean. 

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.892
And you, also, with your waves, you jump up and down and enjoy that compassion of His. 

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.892
Just a drop you are, but you are the Ocean.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.892
This is what explains what Kabira says. You see, these great people have described Him 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.892
but it becomes absolutely ambiguous for you. 

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.892
The human rationality cannot explain all these things. 

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.892
So, your rationality has to improve onto vibratory awareness. 

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.892
You have to go through that level, minimum of minimum, to understand God. 

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.892
You cannot understand Him at this level.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:30.892
So don’t come out here with ideas that you are going to give something to God, no! 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.892
You have to take; you cannot give anything to Him. But in your humility, 

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.892
if you express yourself, He likes it.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.892
The Master loves when a little child brings some flowers for him. 

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:59.892
When a little baby brings, say, flowers for the Mother, the Mother likes it. 

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.892
Not ‘likes’, but in Sanskrit there’s a word, ‘kautupa’. I don’t know, there’s no word in English for that, 

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.892
I am sorry. ‘Kautupa’ is the happiness, the joy that one feels when he sees this child come up, 

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.892
when the person sees the child returning the love in its small way. 

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.892
After all children are – what are they going to do, you see?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.892
Like this one, you see, one day he brought 2p for me. He says, “Grandmother, 

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.892
you can buy a sari with this, yes, you’d better keep it with you.” You see, he found it somewhere, 

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.892
he said, “I haven’t earned it, but I’ve got for you, so you can keep it and buy a sari.” 

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.892
Then the feelings that come into mind, there’s the kautupa. 

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.892
The feeling that comes within at that time in a Mother’s heart, is the kautupa, 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:02.892
the sweetness of that, the beauty of that. You cannot understand by your dry rationality, 

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.892
it can make you parched, completely. It has no feelings, it has no sensitivity, nothing.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.892
O God, this ego, I tell you this so-called ego, has really parched human beings completely 

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.892
of all the beautiful things that have been flowing in them, all the sensitivity. 

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.892
And horrible books and horrible things that people have taught you have really finished 

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.892
all that’s beautiful that was within you. Such beautiful flowers were created 

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.892
with such beautiful fragrance to be emitted, have been parched completely, 

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.892
I feel, by this foolish ego of human beings which is so limited. 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.892
It was given to you just to understand a few things but you have covered yourself completely 

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:08.892
with that mud and it’s such a difficult thing I find, such a difficult thing.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.892
Some examples can be given. A boy came to see Me, the other day, 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.892
with a friend who is a very great Sahaja Yogi, I must say. He’s not here today. 

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.892
And he is, I would say, just to please the Sahaja Yogi I said, “All right, I’ll take him out.” 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.892
Found the boy had a terrible guilt within him, because he had done something horrible, 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.892
absolutely horrid. But I told him that, “You have a guilt and it’s forgiven, so give it up. 

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.892
Try it, try it.” But nothing works out with him, so egoistical, 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.892
so egoistical; and such a small thing he was. I mean,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.892
if he was anywhere near the Truth, I would have understood also that he thinks 

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.892
that he should get it or do it and all that. But nothing of the kind.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:08.892
He goes back and tells this Sahaja Yogi, “Oh, I think She is just a ordinary housewife, that’s all, 

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.892
don’t take Her seriously.” Then the Sahaja Yogi said, 

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.892
“Oh, really, what a business! How many people have you cured? 

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.892
I have seen people suffering from cancer even, cured by Her. I have seen, with my own eyes, 

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.892
Kundalini rising, I have seen people getting Realisation. 

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:44.892
There are so many I have seen with my own eyes. I have to disbelieve all that and believe you?” 

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:54.892
I never knew that he was that superficial. And this is his answer.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.892
But as I had told you that you can take the position when you are bothered. 

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.892
And when I take a position like that, that I am bothered about you, 

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:20.892
then I think that really you are still very, very ignorant. But at least see, at least ask for it, 

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.892
and it should be done because the creation has to be completed, it has to be fulfilled. 

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.892
And you have to know the meaning of your being, you have to know why God has created you 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.892
and what are you. That is a must! People waste their time with this and that. 

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.892
There’s no time to be wasted any more I can tell you this much. 

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.892
In the West such a wastage of time I find. Same in the East is, 

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.892
they are doing what you have done before, like they are trying to build bridges 

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.892
and they are trying to do now underground trains. 

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.892
And those who have done it are now committing suicides.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:20.892
Between these two ends where do I stand sometimes, I start looking at My face. 

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.892
What should I do with these extremes that are there?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.892
So please also put your Mr. Ego outside with your shoes, so it will work out. 

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:44.892
If it does not work out, that’s not My concern, nor is My problem. 

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:56.892
It is your problem that it has not worked out. If an operation is not successful, 

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.892
then the doctor can be blamed because he takes money for it, but not Mataji. 

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.892
Not because I don’t take money, but I’m not bothered about it. 

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.892
I’m only bothered that you should get your realisation. 

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.892
But I’m not bothered if you have not got it. Can you understand that part?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.892
I will work morning till evening, evening till morning to give you realisation, 

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.892
but if you don’t want it, I’m not bothered, see. Neither if it does not work out, 

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.892
I am not bothered, it is a simple thing. 

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.892
This is the only difference between a mother on this earth and I, the Mother, 

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:03.892
who has to really give you the keys of your kingdom, the keys of your joy, the keys of your Truth: 

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:14.892
I have to do that. And I don’t give you by taking anything from you. 

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.892
This must be understood, because egoistical people immediately are on the guard.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:30.892
What have you got to give in Sahaja Yoga? I do not take anything from you. I give you, 

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.892
because I have got it with Me and you can have it, because that’s your right, so you better have it. 

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.892
But if you don’t want to have it, I am not going to force you. 

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:51.892
And then I play some tricks, which I must confess, because I’m not bothered. 

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.892
And with the tricks people disappear, reappear then disappear. So be careful on that point.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:10.892
This is the Principle of Brahma which is detached. 

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.892
The Principle of Brahma is detached, that acts and takes away the interest, 

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.892
the interest goes away, the attention goes away. You are not bothered about it. 

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:34.892
This Principle cannot be overcome. It is The Principle Itself. It cannot compromise,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.892
that’s the point, being absolute. Absolute things cannot compromise. For example, 

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.892
there are some people who may say… you see, there are some people who do say that, 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.892
“Mataji says that you have to lead a dharmic life.” 

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.892
Indeed, you have to. I mean I cannot give realisation to Mr. Hitler if he comes to Me. 

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.892
There is something which cannot be compromised. 

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:10.892
You have to do something, you have to be in a position to receive it, 

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:23.892
and even if you receive it without that position, it can be worked out.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:43.892
It is also not the Principle that goes out of the way to demand something, no, it doesn’t. 

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.892
To a point only, but it won’t. But it is such a Living Principle, 

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.892
the beauty of Living Principle I will tell you. Which perhaps you know it but you do not know it.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.892
When the principle is dead, like say this house is built, it has got a foundation, 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.892
then it is built up, then a house is brought in and then everything is done. 

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.892
Then once done is done. If the foundation is weak, it is weak forever, you cannot improve it.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.892
But the Living Principle is, whatever may be your foundation, 

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.892
it will penetrate into your foundations, into your backgrounds, 

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:31.892
into everything and can correct it completely. You just ask for it. 

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.892
Whatever may be your conditionings and whatever may be your guilts, 

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.892
whatever may be your problems, whatever sins you might have committed, 

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.892
whatever wrong things you might have done, the Living Principle can penetrate into it 

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.892
and can reform the whole thing and transform it into the fruit. You have seen it, in a tree, 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.892
supposing a tree is sick, if you treat it, you completely can manifest the fruit. 

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.892
But if you vibrate it, then you see the whole beautiful stuff, becomes very beautiful. 

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:13.892
So, this is the Living Principle and that’s why Christ has said it, “I’m the living God.” 

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.892
This is the difference between the Living Principle which enlivens or awakens 

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:34.892
every part of your deadened chakras, every part of your deadened psyches. 

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.892
It awakens in you, it cures in you, it purifies in you, 

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:49.892
it absolutely neutralises all that is filth, dirt and ugliness, all that is called as sin. It doesn’t talk, 

00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:00.892
it works out, but you have to just ask for it. Just ask the question. 

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.892
That’s the beauty of the Living Principle. That’s why, when people get cured with Sahaja Yoga, 

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.892
don’t be surprised – it’s just a by-product, it’s nothing important. 

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.892
Even when the mad people become alright, nothing surprising, it’s just a by-product. 

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.892
Because it’s a Living Principle which penetrates into everything, it breaks every bit and bit of it, cures it, 

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:33.892
makes it alright, beautiful; makes it into a flower. And that is what is promised.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.892
But then people come down for Sahaja Yoga, “Mother, I have a problem.” 

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.892
I said, “Then what’s the problem?” “My friend has not written any letter to me, will You help me?” 

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.892
Now this is sometimes, puts Me down. It’s too much. 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.892
It’s alright, even that can be solved, these problems. 

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.892
After all, a Mother has to solve these little, little problems of Her children.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.892
But ask for the Highest, “Twamekam sharenyam, twamekam varenyam – 

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.892
There is nothing to be asked for but for God.” Don’t ask other. The rest is all dust, 

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.892
is all that will finish off, is all chalayman : is coming and going, finished. 

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:34.892
Ask for the Eternal, ask for that is stable, ask for that is the Highest and the Purest. 

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.892
Don’t make Me come down to that. I play with you. 

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.892
When My child asks Me something, I have to tell him, “Alright, have it.” 

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.892
But when you mature you must ask for the Highest. Do not ask for a job and things. 

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:01.892
Alright, if you have a problem, it works, but you can understand now, from where to where.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.892
For today it’s al right because I’m bit too much in a Nishprayovens condition. 

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.892
And I was telling just now to these people, “I don’t know what I’m going to talk,” 

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.892
but I have taught something and if you have any questions, please ask Me. 

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.892
In the meanwhile, I would like some Sahaja Yogis to see these people 

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.892
and then we’ll go in for a meditation. I’ll have some water if there is some? 

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:41.892
Can you close that? Can you see these people now? 

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.892
No, just go and see one or two patients that are there.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.892
Tum logon ke hath me thanda ka aa raha kuch? Aisa rukh hath, aisa rukh. [Did you feel cool breeze? 

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.892
Hold your hands like this.] All of you should sit with hands like this. Better? How is he better?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:55.892
Hold your hands like this.] All of you should sit with hands like this. Better? How is he better?
