00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.710
You know what has happened.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.440
You know Mathias how great he was, 
how much he fought for Sahaja Yoga,  

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.460
how much he worked for it. So generous, so 
surrendered, and very innocent person he was.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.851
He was such a precious son of mine.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.035
I did feel that he's having a bad time because 
of his other activities

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:58.652
And I warned him twice, once individually

00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:04.080
but he didn't take 
it that seriously, perhaps he might be thinking  

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.234
that Mother is always careful about us, 
concerned about us.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:17.251
But when I called him individually and told him for half an hour, 
he should have understood what I was saying.

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:22.229
Apart from a Sahaja Yogi, he was a great patriot.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.745
He was working for Poland trying to help them

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.858
to improve their financial conditions in there.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.664
But for that, he has to go- he had to go to Poland 
many a times.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.871
I had warned him not to go anymore.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.720
But I don't think it took me 
that seriously, as I told him,  

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.353
I don't know how to make things look very serious.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:05.325
You all have to take one lesson 
from this. I have to make very

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:17.280
earnest request that if I tell you not 
to do something, please just listen to me. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.685
You are under my protection, no doubt,

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.771
we had miracles recently

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:25.701
of people being saved from death traps and things.

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:31.663
But for that, if I warn you,
if there's some internal trouble,  

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.028
you all should take it very seriously. 
I will never waste my words for nothing at all !

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.670
For him, it is no loss because he'll be born again.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.559
it's just like changing your clothes I know.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.176
But we'll miss him very much.

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.663
No doubt.

00:02:56.878 --> 00:02:59.748
For everything, not for work but for his 
love,

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:03.114
for his compassion, for his forgiveness,

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:09.900
and extremely gentle handling of things.

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:14.102
There were lots of problems in Switzerland,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.506
funny type of problems, which he 
solved very carefully, beautifully

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.902
and many things he solved on his own, without 
telling me,

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:28.690
which was really very remarkable.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.041
He never wanted to trouble me for anything.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.413
I don't know how to count all the good qualities 
he had

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.747
and how he was an expert in many things.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.475
He had bought one watch for me

00:03:57.475 --> 00:04:00.720
as 
a present from Swiss people, I think,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.120
and it was known as Patek Philippe,
it's supposed to be the best.  

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:08.772
And that got spoiled.

00:04:08.772 --> 00:04:14.054
He says, "Mother, this hits the ego of these Patek Philippe people".

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:17.269
So rightly said!

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.229
I said, "How?" He said, "They think no end  
of themselves, you see.

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.986
They give guarantees.

00:04:24.088 --> 00:04:27.161
When I showed them, they said, "We don't know 
how it is spoiled".

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:30.000
I had not used it even.

00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:33.904
I've seen it, that's all.

00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:36.936
So, he said, "They felt very much frightened

00:04:36.936 --> 00:04:40.868
as to what had happened how their watch has been 
spoiled".

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:44.724
I said, "They need some introspection".

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:46.856
That's why it has happened.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:51.533
There're so many beautiful memories of him;

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.870
all that I'm thinking of the nice 
beautiful stories he told me about people.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.687
Last time, he brought a newspaper, saying that,
"Mother, see what these Catholics  are doing in Switzerland.

00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:13.873
Now show them".

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.258
I said, "You'd better show them. They are not 
bothered".

00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:23.057
He said, "They'll bother if you go on hitting them like this, they'll bother.

00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:26.929
They'll have to bother. People have to bother".

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.315
All the time, his wisdom has helped.

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:41.319
And very practical sense of dealing with things.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.053
But I feel now after the death of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:52.256 --> 00:05:55.890
the sadness becomes collective.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.094
Also, it bothers me too much.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.492
I haven't slept last night at all.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:14.327
And I'm sure his soul would be very 
disturbed to see that we are all very sad.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.614
And he would not like it.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.608
 If I had changed the program to Switzerland,  

00:06:23.608 --> 00:06:25.602
he would have blamed himself 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:35.000
that, "Because of me, my sudden departure, it has 
all been changed or stopped".

00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.433
So, as Sahaja Yogis, we must understand the death,

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:40.358
that there is a soul,

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:43.605
and the soul is here,

00:06:43.683 --> 00:06:47.107
watching all of us, even me.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.780
And it wants to see that you are all very happy,

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.850
that you are not feeling it (sadness) within yourself.

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:02.016
So, to give him complete peace and joy,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.957
we have to just think that he has left us,

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:09.239
and he'll be back very soon with us.

00:07:09.552 --> 00:07:12.216
May God bless you all.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.843
Normally we don't have any programs on Fridays but they said, "We'll have programs". I said, "All right, have it". 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:31.359
But it was nice because I think, little bit, it will change.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.912
The clouds will go over.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.024
We'll have Guru Puja on Sunday. It's a good day.

00:07:55.278 --> 00:08:00.194
But we should have little early, it's important.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.909
Not very early but little early I hope we'll 
try to do that.

00:08:06.143 --> 00:08:11.202
Now your stage is done, everything is done. I don't know what the corrections you want to do.

00:08:11.397 --> 00:08:22.393
Whatever it is, let us try to do the Guru Puja a little early.

00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:25.347
Normally, we start at two o'clock. It’s too much. It should start say, about 12, if that suits you. 

00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:29.213
It should start say, about 12, if that suits you. 

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.433
Another request I have to make, is that

00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:38.446
our water supply has, sadly, I don't know has happened to it.

00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:41.752
So, it's best is that you go to the river to have a bath.

00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:47.263
You might find that the river is very cold but this cold water 
is very energy giving.

00:08:47.263 --> 00:08:54.730
into the river Ganges, in Haridwar, you feel as if it's a freeze,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.693
freezing point, and your feet start freezing.

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.768
But once you get out of it, you are red and feels so energetic and so happy.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.556
So, I would request you to go to the river and all of you, if you go there, it won't be that cold also.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:18.636
We had no water at all. So, I think that the consumption of water is bit too much,

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:22.330
compared to the tanks we have.

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.215
So, it's all right, morning time, you can do anything.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.826
And also people who will be in Daglio, there’s this beautiful river there.

00:09:28.953 --> 00:09:33.128
You can go in that river. But here is a river, there's also swimming pool.

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:36.003
And we have no- they have no objection for that.

00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:39.658
So, it's a nice way to go there and have some nice time.

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:41.795
Thank you very much.
