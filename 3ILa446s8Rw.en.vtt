00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:38.519
I was told that we have a very beautiful place
for this puja and I was amazed how everything

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:42.169
is working out so beautifully for all of you.

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.739
You are all very lucky people I must say.

00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:51.839
Moreover that this place was called as the
“fort of flowers” and now it was called

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:57.458
as a “fort of blood”, bloody fort.

00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:02.918
But I think with all these flowers it should
become the “fort of flowers” again.

00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:07.839
It’s a very, very beautiful place you have
come to.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:11.738
The vibrations are also very good here.

00:08:11.738 --> 00:08:17.818
I’ve been always wondering why Germany was
called as Germany.

00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:25.468
Germ, germ means sprouting.

00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:30.798
Any germ of anything means the sprouting of
it.

00:08:30.798 --> 00:08:35.189
Germinate means to sprout.

00:08:35.189 --> 00:08:47.959
The sprouting of Sahaja Yoga as I’ve told
you many a times before once taken by Germans

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:54.879
will be reaching its epitome, its highest
point.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:09:02.109
We have had lots of ups and downs, doesn’t
matter.

00:09:02.109 --> 00:09:14.809
It’s a difficult place and now we have started
really the germination in a proper way.

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:22.309
Yesterday I saw the whole sky was filled with
color and light.

00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:25.139
As you know that vibrations have light.

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:37.310
It’s very light flickering, very small light,
each particle of vibration has and you can

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.199
see that.

00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:47.869
But when there are too many, then they can
be caught up by your cameras.

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:54.628
But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated.

00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:57.229
And is a very great thing to get the clouds
vibrated.

00:09:57.229 --> 00:10:01.789
If the clouds are vibrated, the rain will
be vibrated.

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:07.699
If the rain is vibrated, the land will be
vibrated.

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:21.158
All the crops that are to be germinated will
be vibrated too, so when it goes into the

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:25.628
body of human beings, they’ll get also vibrations.

00:10:25.628 --> 00:10:30.548
Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds,
I think, if you have to have many more people

00:10:30.548 --> 00:10:32.388
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:32.388 --> 00:10:39.638
That’s the idea came into My mind last night
that why not vibrate all the clouds, that’s

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:42.718
the best way.

00:10:42.718 --> 00:11:00.408
Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit,
with one point going into a half circle normally.

00:11:00.408 --> 00:11:11.679
This half circle then combines to make “Aum”
sometimes, sometimes it makes a chain, sometimes

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:15.768
it gathers together to make crosses.

00:11:15.768 --> 00:11:27.599
But the basic thing about them is that they
can think, and think very fast, much faster

00:11:27.599 --> 00:11:30.029
than human beings can think.

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:34.578
And they are extremely collective, extremely
collective.

00:11:34.578 --> 00:11:43.408
So they move together, thinking the same way,
understanding the same way in an absolute

00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:55.139
manner and work out the whole thing in a very
beautiful silent way that you cannot even

00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:56.139
feel.

00:11:56.139 --> 00:12:02.519
Now the Kundalini rising, as you have done,
must be a mystery for all of you that how

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:08.649
can you with your hands raise the Kundalini,
and you must be thinking that, “This must

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:15.489
be some sort of a special power Mother has
given us that we can put our hands to anybody’s

00:12:15.489 --> 00:12:20.829
Kundalini, it rises, then stops at a place
when there is problem and then again it rises.”

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:27.399
Now it’s nothing a mystery for you.

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:33.949
You have got now within you the power.

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:43.359
Like you can move the water, you can move
the matter, you can move all those things.

00:12:43.359 --> 00:12:49.599
Animals cannot do that and even if they can
do little bit here and there, they cannot

00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:52.689
transform it for their use.

00:12:52.689 --> 00:13:01.639
For example, you see the nice brass here,
you see nice silver there, there’s a little

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:03.849
Ganesha sitting there.

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:11.919
All these have been transformed from something
that is dead, which animals cannot do.

00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:20.579
As you become the master of living work – now
you are the masters of living work now, not

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:21.659
of the dead.

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:32.209
So the living force you can manage and mould
it and use it for your own purpose.

00:13:32.209 --> 00:13:38.099
But the most surprising thing is that you
are not even aware of it, that you are doing

00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:39.099
it.

00:13:39.099 --> 00:13:44.919
Like when you are doing, say a little elephant
like that, you are aware and you know that

00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:46.849
you are doing something great.

00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:51.139
And you will tell, “Oh, I have made such
and such thing, such a nice place I have done.”

00:13:51.139 --> 00:13:56.319
You’ll be conscious of it because you have
got ego.

00:13:56.319 --> 00:14:01.959
But when you are giving Realization to people,
you are not aware, because you have no ego.

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:07.719
And what you say, “Mother, it’s not coming
up, see it’s just catching on Vishuddhi,

00:14:07.719 --> 00:14:09.809
it’s not working out.”

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:14.199
You start speaking in third person – you
don’t say, “I can’t do it” or “I

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:15.199
have done it.”

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:16.199
“It’s worked out.”

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:21.019
Only when it’s worked out, I see your faces
and I know it’s done.

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:27.339
So you are not even aware of it, you are not
even conscious of it and there’s no ego

00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:28.339
about it.

00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:31.559
You don’t take any credit for that, you
just feel joyous.

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:38.749
Like so many people came for your workshop
– “Oh, it was so great, Mother.”

00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:40.599
What was great was you.

00:14:40.599 --> 00:14:44.269
It was you who was doing all the job.

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:47.909
You were working it out but you don’t feel
that way.

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:54.539
The reason is that you are now working in
a way that we call as akarma.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:15:00.469
Akarma is that when you do something but you
do not feel you are doing something.

00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:04.509
When you are not conscious of it, that is
akarma.

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:09.799
When you are doing something, and you think
that you are doing this work, that work, that

00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:11.799
thing, then it is a karma.

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:15.389
But now the karma has become an akarma, not
that you are not doing anything.

00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:22.469
You are doing so many things but you do not
feel that you are doing it because you have

00:15:22.469 --> 00:15:27.259
now doing been doing akarma and all living
work is akarma.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:34.719
Like the Mother Earth, She sprouts seeds – She
is not aware of it.

00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:41.589
In the same way you people are raising the
Kundalini, you are not aware of it.

00:15:41.589 --> 00:15:45.999
And when you are not aware of it, you don’t
even want to think, “How it is happening?

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:50.939
See me, a human being raising a hand like
this definitely the Kundalini rises, I see

00:15:50.939 --> 00:15:52.349
it comes out of the head.

00:15:52.349 --> 00:15:54.929
It happens, I see this, it’s a fact.

00:15:54.929 --> 00:15:59.259
Then how is it that this is happening?

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.489
What is the process?

00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:03.749
What is the procedure?

00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:05.958
How it has worked?

00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.989
Did I make any mistakes?”

00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:10.349
You never think like that.

00:16:10.349 --> 00:16:13.109
“Did I do it in a wrong manner?”

00:16:13.109 --> 00:16:14.109
You don’t think.

00:16:14.109 --> 00:16:16.699
Sir, just you start – raise the Kundalini.

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:22.639
You just don’t bother to find out, “Have
I given myself a bandhan or not?

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:26.269
Have I seen the gentleman what his vibrations
are like?”

00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:28.789
No, you just go ahead, raise your hands, yes.

00:16:28.789 --> 00:16:34.779
You are quite aware of one thing: that you
are a realized soul and that you can raise

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:36.409
the Kundalini.

00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:40.099
Yesterday I saw so many Sahaja Yogis walked
in.

00:16:40.099 --> 00:16:41.909
I said, “Now come along, give them Realization.

00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:49.359
Just stood there, did like this, did like
that – finished.

00:16:49.359 --> 00:16:54.199
You did not even think you have done such
a great living work, that you have raised

00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:55.199
their Kundalini.

00:16:55.199 --> 00:16:56.629
Not only that, but it will transform them.

00:16:56.629 --> 00:17:01.389
It will give them a new life.

00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:05.269
There will be some special people, as you
are.

00:17:05.269 --> 00:17:09.589
You are not even aware that you are some special
people.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.039
Ego has vanished.

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:18.099
So now you don’t think that you are doing
anything, you think, “It’s Mother is doing

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.099
everything.”

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.439
Even then they give big, big speeches, they
say, “Mother, I never used to speak, I didn’t

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:25.289
know what was speech.

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:33.019
And now I have become a great speaker, it’s
You, You who is doing it.”

00:17:33.019 --> 00:17:40.619
This feeling comes because there is no ego
any more left.

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:47.359
Now if you see in the water, if you put a
drop it becomes an ocean, no doubt.

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:51.959
But it’s not aware of it that it has become
an ocean, it moves with the ocean.

00:17:51.959 --> 00:18:00.799
But supposing you see a fish -a fish is free.

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:06.729
If she wants, she can move this way, she can
move that way, she can jump up, she can drink

00:18:06.729 --> 00:18:11.429
the water, she can do what she likes.

00:18:11.429 --> 00:18:15.849
But a drop cannot, drop has to be part and
parcel of the whole.

00:18:15.849 --> 00:18:20.339
So that was the intermediary stage when you
were animals.

00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:26.119
Animals were under Paasha, under the bandhan
of God.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:30.529
So they were doing exactly what was to be
done.

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:35.729
Then you became human beings, where you had
complete freedom to use it as you liked.

00:18:35.729 --> 00:18:38.809
If you wanted to go heaven, go to heaven.

00:18:38.809 --> 00:18:41.660
If you want to go to hell, you can go to hell.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.508
It’s all are open to you.

00:18:43.508 --> 00:18:59.349
But now after becoming realized souls, you
have become absolutely free people.

00:18:59.349 --> 00:19:05.689
But in that freedom, you feel Me being there.

00:19:05.689 --> 00:19:06.689
Now what is this?

00:19:06.689 --> 00:19:14.459
Am I trying to tie you up with something or
am I giving you some chains, or am I guiding

00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:20.948
you, or am I all the time sort of a person
with a gun behind you, “Do this, otherwise

00:19:20.948 --> 00:19:22.269
this will happen.”?

00:19:22.269 --> 00:19:24.419
That is not so.

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:32.579
So what is this new thing that is happening
to Sahaja Yogis, it’s to be understood fully.

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:40.179
The new thing is like this, like a fish goes
everywhere, does everything, but has no discretion;

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:48.239
doesn’t know which way to go, what to do,
sometimes get caught up into the – into

00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:51.969
the net of a fisherman.

00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:56.249
It can be eaten up by another big fish.

00:19:56.249 --> 00:19:58.669
It can be destroyed anytime.

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:05.749
It may just crawl onto the shore and get finished.

00:20:05.749 --> 00:20:10.719
So the fish has no discretion.

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:15.198
But it has some innate knowledge to save itself
from dangers.

00:20:15.198 --> 00:20:22.719
Now you don’t have any innate knowledge
about it – how to save yourself from dangers,

00:20:22.719 --> 00:20:25.029
how to save yourselves from troubles.

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:30.159
No innate knowledge like that – that you
are cautious, you shouldn’t walk this way,

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:34.149
you shouldn’t go like this, you shouldn’t
give vibrations to somebody, you should not

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:35.149
treat somebody.

00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:37.019
No, that’s not there.

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:43.919
Innately you don’t have this knowledge,
that we should try to save ourselves, we should

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:50.389
go from the right side, not from the left
side, it would be inauspicious, not so much.

00:20:50.389 --> 00:20:52.839
Still you always do right things.

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:58.809
Whichever time you will choose will be the
right auspicious time.

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:03.059
You don’t have to consult books on that.

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:13.019
Like once it happened in Lonavala, we had
a puja, and it was to be at 10 o’clock as

00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:16.559
it was here.

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:21.529
I wouldn’t go for My bath for quite some
time and they were quite upset – “Mother,

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:22.529
what’s the matter?”

00:21:22.529 --> 00:21:23.529
I said.

00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:27.099
“It’s all right, let’s go ahead and
see” … was talking here, there, there,

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:30.839
there… then I went for My bath at about
11 o’clock.

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:39.309
When I come back it was 12 o’clock, the
sun had gone to the other side.

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:42.599
So they said, er … they were little upset.

00:21:42.599 --> 00:21:48.169
I said, “Now, bring the panchar” – the
one which where all the timings are written

00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:49.519
about the moon.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:54.179
So till 11 o’clock there was amavasya.

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:57.789
Amavasya is the day when there is no moon
in the sky.

00:21:57.789 --> 00:22:06.568
So I can’t take my bath in amavasya and
you cannot have puja otherwise, so I had to

00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:07.568
wait.

00:22:07.568 --> 00:22:08.568
They were amazed.

00:22:08.568 --> 00:22:11.419
They said, “We had consulted the panchar.”

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:13.639
I said, “Which one?”

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:21.378
And you see, they saw, they were surprised
that how is it that Mother could tell about

00:22:21.378 --> 00:22:23.579
amavasya and this and that.

00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:29.289
Because the discretion, the knowledge of discretion,
is built within you.

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:37.929
So whatever you do, whatever way you work
it out, is built-in with you.

00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:40.139
You know how to do it.

00:22:40.139 --> 00:22:45.959
For example, for a human being, if you prick
him with a pin, immediately his hand will

00:22:45.959 --> 00:22:46.959
lift it.

00:22:46.959 --> 00:22:49.059
Who has told him to do that?

00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:50.639
Who has taught him to do that?

00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:57.239
No, in his consciousness it is built that
once you are pricked, immediately your hand

00:22:57.239 --> 00:23:01.438
will go out, automatically with a reflex action.

00:23:01.438 --> 00:23:08.948
So the reflex action to auspiciousness, reflex
action to your saving, reflex action to everything,

00:23:08.948 --> 00:23:11.459
is built-in within you.

00:23:11.459 --> 00:23:15.819
And once you become a Sahaja Yogi, immediately
you will start giving yourself a bandhan,

00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:17.499
you’ll start giving others a bandhan.

00:23:17.499 --> 00:23:22.979
You don’t have to think about it, a reflex
action, you will do whatever you will do,

00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:24.329
will be auspicious.

00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:27.169
Whatever you will do, will be beautiful.

00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:29.979
Whatever you’ll ask, will be beautiful.

00:23:29.979 --> 00:23:36.369
Like this place you got it and people are
amazed – how do we get it?

00:23:36.369 --> 00:23:39.889
But in the beginning you have to develop,
you have to mature.

00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:44.579
Unless and until you are matured, you do not
get that discretion.

00:23:44.579 --> 00:23:50.149
Like when we were trying to get a place in
London, I went with some Sahaja Yogis to find

00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:51.149
out the place.

00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:53.429
Now all kinds of funny places they were liking.

00:23:53.429 --> 00:23:57.999
I said, “The vibrations are so bad, these
people are not feeling any vibrations or anything.”

00:23:57.999 --> 00:24:02.129
I wouldn’t even get in the place, I’d
say, “No, no, no, no this is no good.”

00:24:02.129 --> 00:24:03.599
They said, “No, this has character, this
has that.”

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:07.309
I said, “This character all that doesn’t
count with Me, you see.

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:11.029
So they said, “But Mother, how are we going
to get a good place and…”

00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:12.379
I said, “We’ll get it.

00:24:12.379 --> 00:24:13.669
[And you…]

00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:23.719
I was traveling by a plane, in the plane I
opened a magazine and there I found Shudy

00:24:23.719 --> 00:24:24.889
Camp.

00:24:24.889 --> 00:24:30.889
When I went back, I said, “Now this is the
place for us, let’s go and have a look.”

00:24:30.889 --> 00:24:33.988
And there it was, and we found such a beautiful
place.

00:24:33.988 --> 00:24:41.539
So, we should allow, see, things to work out,
have patience, things will work out automatically

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:46.399
because now the whole of the cosmos is with
us.

00:24:46.399 --> 00:24:50.659
The whole of the discretion of the cosmos
is with us.

00:24:50.659 --> 00:24:54.579
The vibrations that think are there.

00:24:54.579 --> 00:24:58.649
The vibrations that guide are with us.

00:24:58.649 --> 00:25:01.889
The vibrations that organize are with us.

00:25:01.889 --> 00:25:03.439
Let them organize us.

00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:10.549
We are playing into their hands by which we
are not bound, but we are helped.

00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:14.459
Like supposing you have a baby, you have to
look after the baby.

00:25:14.459 --> 00:25:18.669
But if there’s somebody, she says, “All
right, let me look after your baby.”

00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:19.949
She says, “All right.”

00:25:19.949 --> 00:25:22.459
Then you go to sleep.

00:25:22.459 --> 00:25:26.089
There’s somebody who says, “All right,
don’t you worry, I’ll make a nice bed

00:25:26.089 --> 00:25:27.229
for you.”

00:25:27.229 --> 00:25:28.229
So he says, “All right.”

00:25:28.229 --> 00:25:29.749
So they make a nice bed for him.

00:25:29.749 --> 00:25:34.199
Then you sleep there, there’s somebody to
cover you, nicely you are covered.

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:39.869
Then they say, “All right, you have to now
go for your bath -see the bath’s ready for

00:25:39.869 --> 00:25:42.139
you, come along have your bath.”

00:25:42.139 --> 00:25:46.579
Then you want to have your puja -“All right,
there’s a nice place for you, come along

00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:47.579
have this.”

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:48.589
You want to have an ashram?

00:25:48.589 --> 00:25:51.919
“All right, there’s a nice place for you
available, have it.”

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:55.139
So it is not that you are bound by them.

00:25:55.139 --> 00:25:57.319
This is the point I am trying to make.

00:25:57.319 --> 00:26:02.139
But you are invited, you are treated with
great respect and regard and everybody at

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:03.199
your service.

00:26:03.199 --> 00:26:07.339
You say, “Mother, You come in my head”,
I’ll come in your head.

00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:09.309
You say, “Come in my heart”, I’ll come
in your heart.

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:12.749
You say, “Come in my hands”, I’ll come
in your hands.

00:26:12.749 --> 00:26:19.869
So the whole of the cosmos is at your service
as if you are on the stage now, doing the

00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:21.809
job for Me.

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:25.039
Now to think that you are under bondage is
a wrong thing.

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:32.250
There’s no bondage, on the contrary the
people who are ganas, who are angels, who

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.899
are deities, are anxious to do whatever is
possible to please you, to keep you happy.

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:45.989
If you say, “Now the Kundalini has to raise”,
all right they are all there to help you.

00:26:45.989 --> 00:26:51.319
Anything you want can be done, but first of
all what you need is maturity.

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:57.249
And for maturity, one has to understand that
there is a culture of the spirit.

00:26:57.249 --> 00:27:06.249
As we have human cultures, we have culture
of the spirit which must be imbibed.

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:17.319
The culture of the spirit is to be imbibed.

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:27.279
If you go according to the culture of the
spirit, then you cannot have problems, and

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:32.009
the foremost thing in the culture of spirit
is that you must respect yourself because

00:27:32.009 --> 00:27:36.289
you are an yogi.

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:43.169
Second thing is you must respect other yogi,
because they are yogis.

00:27:43.169 --> 00:27:51.029
Like I have told you before in Ganapatipule,
there was one tailor, Namadeva, who was a

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:59.819
saint and he went to see another one who was
just a potter.

00:27:59.819 --> 00:28:06.919
And the potter was mixing the mud with water
with his feet, he was working there when Namadeva

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:09.809
went and saw him.

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:16.829
He saw him and what he says, “Nirgunachya
bheti alo sagunashi”, meaning “I came

00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:23.119
to see here formless, the vibrations, the
Chaitanya.

00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:24.119
Formless – nirgun.

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:29.619
I came to see a nirgun, meet nirguna [formless]
but here it is in sagun [form].

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:33.369
You are the one who is in form of that chaitanya.”

00:28:33.369 --> 00:28:39.968
What a place, just think: one Sahaja Yogi
saying to another, “Oh God, I just came

00:28:39.968 --> 00:28:47.719
here to meet the nirguna, the nirachara, and
whom do I meet here is the saguna, is the…

00:28:47.719 --> 00:28:57.439
in the form, in the form, in you I see nothing
but Chaitanya.

00:28:57.439 --> 00:29:03.769
That is the, that is the respect of the another
yogi or understanding.

00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:11.789
Namadeva was an ordinary tailor and was not
a Brahmin, so he was not treated very well

00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:20.669
by other Brahmins, and he had to go to Punjab,
or it was said that he was called to Punjab,

00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:25.399
and he went to Punjab where Guru Nanaka saw
him.

00:29:25.399 --> 00:29:31.219
And Guru Nanak said that a great saint has
come to us.

00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:36.309
So He kept him with Him, and He said, “You’d
better learn Punjabi because here the people

00:29:36.309 --> 00:29:43.579
don’t understand Marathi so learn Punjabi
and make your poems in Punjabi language.”

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:46.839
And he started making poems in Punjabi language.

00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:49.879
Now I’ve got Namadeva’s Gatha, so big
is that his book.

00:29:49.879 --> 00:29:57.310
Half of it is all Punjabi language and then
the poems he makes are so beautiful, they

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.019
are sung in the Guru Granth Sahib they have
in the temple.

00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:08.679
You know in all these big temples of gurudwaras
of the Sikhs, they have Guru Granth Sahib.

00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:16.859
There the Namadeva is occupying at least one-tenth
of the Guru Granth Sahib and there’s also

00:30:16.859 --> 00:30:23.889
Jannabai, another maid-servant who was working
with this Namdev, her poems are also there.

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:29.819
So how they were respected by each other and
how they understood each other was something

00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:31.119
so great.

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:34.559
But now, it is just the other way around.

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:43.079
We, the people who are false, who are wrong
type of people, who are making money out of

00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:49.968
God, who are deceiving people, who are bringing
all wrath and also all the negativity to this

00:30:49.968 --> 00:30:55.759
world, to destroy this world, are respected
by common people.

00:30:55.759 --> 00:31:02.559
But the Sahaja Yogis must respect another
Sahaja Yogi, till he is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:07.159
As long as he is a Sahaja Yogi he must be
respected and understood, is very important.

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:15.129
This is the culture of the spirit, in that
we respect all those who are spiritually higher.

00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:20.999
Like talking about God, we cannot say things
which are not proper.

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:26.079
Like we cannot say that God is mischievous,
we cannot say.

00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:28.699
We are saints.

00:31:28.699 --> 00:31:31.119
We have to be very respectful to God.

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:37.419
Any place which is sort of representing God
also must be respected.

00:31:37.419 --> 00:31:43.529
Everything that is godly must be respected,
because that is the culture of the spirit.

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:59.399
It respects all that is godly, all that is
auspicious, all that is beautiful.

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:02.429
In the culture, we do not see superficial
things.

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:10.348
In this culture, we do not yield to anything
because it is expensive or it is with such

00:32:10.348 --> 00:32:13.449
pomp and show or publicity.

00:32:13.449 --> 00:32:21.529
What we see in this culture is how far it
is joy-giving.

00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:29.359
Even a small betel nut if somebody gives Me
with love, I’ll keep it with Me.

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:34.449
And even if you give Me diamonds without love,
I have no value for them.

00:32:34.449 --> 00:32:38.989
They will be lost or they’ll be finished
– good for nothing.

00:32:38.989 --> 00:32:48.569
So the love that you put into everything makes
you a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:48.569 --> 00:32:56.139
How you talk to each other, how you deal with
each other, how you look after with each other.

00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:59.869
How you communicate your love in a pure manner.

00:32:59.869 --> 00:33:05.189
Say a Sahaja Yogi should think, “Oh, I must
take this present for other Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:05.189 --> 00:33:10.869
I’m going there, then that I’ll meet that
Sahaja Yogi, he’ll be there and he’ll

00:33:10.869 --> 00:33:14.129
be there and…” just like your brothers,
see.

00:33:14.129 --> 00:33:19.359
“Ah, after such a long time I’ll be meeting
him, and it will be such a nice thing to meet

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:26.949
him and talk to him and enjoy him and sometimes
also pull his legs and have a nice fun at

00:33:26.949 --> 00:33:27.949
him.”

00:33:27.949 --> 00:33:37.299
But the whole culture is of love, and if you
do not have that sense of love, if you are

00:33:37.299 --> 00:33:45.169
a dry person, or a morose person, or an unhappy
person, then remember you are not a Sahaja

00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:46.169
Yogi.

00:33:46.169 --> 00:33:55.279
A Sahaja Yogi has to be a smiling, enjoying
personality, making others happy.

00:33:55.279 --> 00:34:01.069
That’s the main attitude, main concern should
be.

00:34:01.069 --> 00:34:08.149
Next time I’ll be speaking about the spiritual
culture in Diwali when you’ll be there but

00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:09.149
this is the beginning.

00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:13.859
I have started talking about the new culture
that we have to accept.

00:34:13.859 --> 00:34:18.249
In expressing our love we should not be ashamed.

00:34:18.249 --> 00:34:22.939
We should not feel shy about it at all, we
are expressing our love and love must be expressed.

00:34:22.939 --> 00:34:28.699
There’s no harm in expressing our love.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:33.799
But it happens that in the beginning we feel
little shy, we are conditioned, how to express,

00:34:33.799 --> 00:34:39.019
people will misunderstand and they will think
that we are wrong type of people.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:41.859
No, we are special people.

00:34:41.859 --> 00:34:46.819
We have to make the whole world, they are
not going to make us.

00:34:46.819 --> 00:34:53.749
We have to create the new world and they have
to follow us, we are not going to follow them.

00:34:53.749 --> 00:34:59.549
We are the makers of kings and we are the
makers of queens and we are the makers of

00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:01.339
everything.

00:35:01.339 --> 00:35:04.199
So we have to work it out that way.

00:35:04.199 --> 00:35:11.629
We don’t have to bow to their ways and methods
but we have to patronize and look after them

00:35:11.629 --> 00:35:18.458
when they come to us first, try to treat them
as if a father would treat a son, and then

00:35:18.458 --> 00:35:25.149
bring him up, mould them and give them love
and make them understand that we are people

00:35:25.149 --> 00:35:30.429
of a very, very different domain, of a different
style.

00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:37.879
We are absolutely free people and are being
entertained by the Divine, are being looked

00:35:37.879 --> 00:35:43.679
after by the Divine, are being helped and
decorated by the Divine.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:51.679
Such a privileged place we have, so let us
be of that dignity and of that morality, that

00:35:51.679 --> 00:35:53.169
we stand up to that.

00:35:53.169 --> 00:35:55.939
How can we do something wrong to insult ourself?

00:35:55.939 --> 00:36:00.349
We cannot, we are yogijanas and we have to
be like yogis.

00:36:00.874 --> 00:36:03.164
May God bless you all!
