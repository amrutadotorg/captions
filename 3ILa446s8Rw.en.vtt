WEBVTT

07:28.429 --> 07:38.519
I was told that we have a very beautiful place
for this puja and I was amazed how everything

07:38.519 --> 07:42.169
is working out so beautifully for all of you.

07:42.169 --> 07:45.739
You are all very lucky people I must say.

07:45.739 --> 07:51.839
Moreover that this place was called as the
“fort of flowers” and now it was called

07:51.839 --> 07:57.458
as a “fort of blood”, bloody fort.

07:57.458 --> 08:02.918
But I think with all these flowers it should
become the “fort of flowers” again.

08:02.918 --> 08:07.839
It’s a very, very beautiful place you have
come to.

08:07.839 --> 08:11.738
The vibrations are also very good here.

08:11.738 --> 08:17.818
I’ve been always wondering why Germany was
called as Germany.

08:17.818 --> 08:25.468
Germ, germ means sprouting.

08:25.468 --> 08:30.798
Any germ of anything means the sprouting of
it.

08:30.798 --> 08:35.189
Germinate means to sprout.

08:35.189 --> 08:47.959
The sprouting of Sahaja Yoga as I’ve told
you many a times before once taken by Germans

08:47.959 --> 08:54.879
will be reaching its epitome, its highest
point.

08:54.879 --> 09:02.109
We have had lots of ups and downs, doesn’t
matter.

09:02.109 --> 09:14.809
It’s a difficult place and now we have started
really the germination in a proper way.

09:14.809 --> 09:22.309
Yesterday I saw the whole sky was filled with
color and light.

09:22.309 --> 09:25.139
As you know that vibrations have light.

09:25.139 --> 09:37.310
It’s very light flickering, very small light,
each particle of vibration has and you can

09:37.310 --> 09:39.199
see that.

09:39.199 --> 09:47.869
But when there are too many, then they can
be caught up by your cameras.

09:47.869 --> 09:54.628
But yesterday I think the clouds got vibrated.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.229
And is a very great thing to get the clouds
vibrated.

09:57.229 --> 10:01.789
If the clouds are vibrated, the rain will
be vibrated.

10:01.789 --> 10:07.699
If the rain is vibrated, the land will be
vibrated.

10:07.699 --> 10:21.158
All the crops that are to be germinated will
be vibrated too, so when it goes into the

10:21.158 --> 10:25.628
body of human beings, they’ll get also vibrations.

10:25.628 --> 10:30.548
Is the best way now is to vibrate the clouds,
I think, if you have to have many more people

10:30.548 --> 10:32.388
for Sahaja Yoga.

10:32.388 --> 10:39.638
That’s the idea came into My mind last night
that why not vibrate all the clouds, that’s

10:39.638 --> 10:42.718
the best way.

10:42.718 --> 11:00.408
Moreover the vibrations are very tiny bit,
with one point going into a half circle normally.

11:00.408 --> 11:11.679
This half circle then combines to make “Aum”
sometimes, sometimes it makes a chain, sometimes

11:11.679 --> 11:15.768
it gathers together to make crosses.

11:15.768 --> 11:27.599
But the basic thing about them is that they
can think, and think very fast, much faster

11:27.599 --> 11:30.029
than human beings can think.

11:30.029 --> 11:34.578
And they are extremely collective, extremely
collective.

11:34.578 --> 11:43.408
So they move together, thinking the same way,
understanding the same way in an absolute

11:43.408 --> 11:55.139
manner and work out the whole thing in a very
beautiful silent way that you cannot even

11:55.139 --> 11:56.139
feel.

11:56.139 --> 12:02.519
Now the Kundalini rising, as you have done,
must be a mystery for all of you that how

12:02.519 --> 12:08.649
can you with your hands raise the Kundalini,
and you must be thinking that, “This must

12:08.649 --> 12:15.489
be some sort of a special power Mother has
given us that we can put our hands to anybody’s

12:15.489 --> 12:20.829
Kundalini, it rises, then stops at a place
when there is problem and then again it rises.”

12:20.829 --> 12:27.399
Now it’s nothing a mystery for you.

12:27.399 --> 12:33.949
You have got now within you the power.

12:33.949 --> 12:43.359
Like you can move the water, you can move
the matter, you can move all those things.

12:43.359 --> 12:49.599
Animals cannot do that and even if they can
do little bit here and there, they cannot

12:49.599 --> 12:52.689
transform it for their use.

12:52.689 --> 13:01.639
For example, you see the nice brass here,
you see nice silver there, there’s a little

13:01.639 --> 13:03.849
Ganesha sitting there.

13:03.849 --> 13:11.919
All these have been transformed from something
that is dead, which animals cannot do.

13:11.919 --> 13:20.579
As you become the master of living work – now
you are the masters of living work now, not

13:20.579 --> 13:21.659
of the dead.

13:21.659 --> 13:32.209
So the living force you can manage and mould
it and use it for your own purpose.

13:32.209 --> 13:38.099
But the most surprising thing is that you
are not even aware of it, that you are doing

13:38.099 --> 13:39.099
it.

13:39.099 --> 13:44.919
Like when you are doing, say a little elephant
like that, you are aware and you know that

13:44.919 --> 13:46.849
you are doing something great.

13:46.849 --> 13:51.139
And you will tell, “Oh, I have made such
and such thing, such a nice place I have done.”

13:51.139 --> 13:56.319
You’ll be conscious of it because you have
got ego.

13:56.319 --> 14:01.959
But when you are giving Realization to people,
you are not aware, because you have no ego.

14:01.959 --> 14:07.719
And what you say, “Mother, it’s not coming
up, see it’s just catching on Vishuddhi,

14:07.719 --> 14:09.809
it’s not working out.”

14:09.809 --> 14:14.199
You start speaking in third person – you
don’t say, “I can’t do it” or “I

14:14.199 --> 14:15.199
have done it.”

14:15.199 --> 14:16.199
“It’s worked out.”

14:16.199 --> 14:21.019
Only when it’s worked out, I see your faces
and I know it’s done.

14:21.019 --> 14:27.339
So you are not even aware of it, you are not
even conscious of it and there’s no ego

14:27.339 --> 14:28.339
about it.

14:28.339 --> 14:31.559
You don’t take any credit for that, you
just feel joyous.

14:31.559 --> 14:38.749
Like so many people came for your workshop
– “Oh, it was so great, Mother.”

14:38.749 --> 14:40.599
What was great was you.

14:40.599 --> 14:44.269
It was you who was doing all the job.

14:44.269 --> 14:47.909
You were working it out but you don’t feel
that way.

14:47.909 --> 14:54.539
The reason is that you are now working in
a way that we call as akarma.

14:54.539 --> 15:00.469
Akarma is that when you do something but you
do not feel you are doing something.

15:00.469 --> 15:04.509
When you are not conscious of it, that is
akarma.

15:04.509 --> 15:09.799
When you are doing something, and you think
that you are doing this work, that work, that

15:09.799 --> 15:11.799
thing, then it is a karma.

15:11.799 --> 15:15.389
But now the karma has become an akarma, not
that you are not doing anything.

15:15.389 --> 15:22.469
You are doing so many things but you do not
feel that you are doing it because you have

15:22.469 --> 15:27.259
now doing been doing akarma and all living
work is akarma.

15:27.259 --> 15:34.719
Like the Mother Earth, She sprouts seeds – She
is not aware of it.

15:34.719 --> 15:41.589
In the same way you people are raising the
Kundalini, you are not aware of it.

15:41.589 --> 15:45.999
And when you are not aware of it, you don’t
even want to think, “How it is happening?

15:45.999 --> 15:50.939
See me, a human being raising a hand like
this definitely the Kundalini rises, I see

15:50.939 --> 15:52.349
it comes out of the head.

15:52.349 --> 15:54.929
It happens, I see this, it’s a fact.

15:54.929 --> 15:59.259
Then how is it that this is happening?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.489
What is the process?

16:00.489 --> 16:03.749
What is the procedure?

16:03.749 --> 16:05.958
How it has worked?

16:05.958 --> 16:08.989
Did I make any mistakes?”

16:08.989 --> 16:10.349
You never think like that.

16:10.349 --> 16:13.109
“Did I do it in a wrong manner?”

16:13.109 --> 16:14.109
You don’t think.

16:14.109 --> 16:16.699
Sir, just you start – raise the Kundalini.

16:16.699 --> 16:22.639
You just don’t bother to find out, “Have
I given myself a bandhan or not?

16:22.639 --> 16:26.269
Have I seen the gentleman what his vibrations
are like?”

16:26.269 --> 16:28.789
No, you just go ahead, raise your hands, yes.

16:28.789 --> 16:34.779
You are quite aware of one thing: that you
are a realized soul and that you can raise

16:34.779 --> 16:36.409
the Kundalini.

16:36.409 --> 16:40.099
Yesterday I saw so many Sahaja Yogis walked
in.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.909
I said, “Now come along, give them Realization.

16:41.909 --> 16:49.359
Just stood there, did like this, did like
that – finished.

16:49.359 --> 16:54.199
You did not even think you have done such
a great living work, that you have raised

16:54.199 --> 16:55.199
their Kundalini.

16:55.199 --> 16:56.629
Not only that, but it will transform them.

16:56.629 --> 17:01.389
It will give them a new life.

17:01.389 --> 17:05.269
There will be some special people, as you
are.

17:05.269 --> 17:09.589
You are not even aware that you are some special
people.

17:09.589 --> 17:13.039
Ego has vanished.

17:13.039 --> 17:18.099
So now you don’t think that you are doing
anything, you think, “It’s Mother is doing

17:18.099 --> 17:19.099
everything.”

17:19.099 --> 17:22.439
Even then they give big, big speeches, they
say, “Mother, I never used to speak, I didn’t

17:22.439 --> 17:25.289
know what was speech.

17:25.289 --> 17:33.019
And now I have become a great speaker, it’s
You, You who is doing it.”

17:33.019 --> 17:40.619
This feeling comes because there is no ego
any more left.

17:40.619 --> 17:47.359
Now if you see in the water, if you put a
drop it becomes an ocean, no doubt.

17:47.359 --> 17:51.959
But it’s not aware of it that it has become
an ocean, it moves with the ocean.

17:51.959 --> 18:00.799
But supposing you see a fish -a fish is free.

18:00.799 --> 18:06.729
If she wants, she can move this way, she can
move that way, she can jump up, she can drink

18:06.729 --> 18:11.429
the water, she can do what she likes.

18:11.429 --> 18:15.849
But a drop cannot, drop has to be part and
parcel of the whole.

18:15.849 --> 18:20.339
So that was the intermediary stage when you
were animals.

18:20.339 --> 18:26.119
Animals were under Paasha, under the bandhan
of God.

18:26.119 --> 18:30.529
So they were doing exactly what was to be
done.

18:30.529 --> 18:35.729
Then you became human beings, where you had
complete freedom to use it as you liked.

18:35.729 --> 18:38.809
If you wanted to go heaven, go to heaven.

18:38.809 --> 18:41.660
If you want to go to hell, you can go to hell.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.508
It’s all are open to you.

18:43.508 --> 18:59.349
But now after becoming realized souls, you
have become absolutely free people.

18:59.349 --> 19:05.689
But in that freedom, you feel Me being there.

19:05.689 --> 19:06.689
Now what is this?

19:06.689 --> 19:14.459
Am I trying to tie you up with something or
am I giving you some chains, or am I guiding

19:14.459 --> 19:20.948
you, or am I all the time sort of a person
with a gun behind you, “Do this, otherwise

19:20.948 --> 19:22.269
this will happen.”?

19:22.269 --> 19:24.419
That is not so.

19:24.419 --> 19:32.579
So what is this new thing that is happening
to Sahaja Yogis, it’s to be understood fully.

19:32.579 --> 19:40.179
The new thing is like this, like a fish goes
everywhere, does everything, but has no discretion;

19:40.179 --> 19:48.239
doesn’t know which way to go, what to do,
sometimes get caught up into the – into

19:48.239 --> 19:51.969
the net of a fisherman.

19:51.969 --> 19:56.249
It can be eaten up by another big fish.

19:56.249 --> 19:58.669
It can be destroyed anytime.

19:58.669 --> 20:05.749
It may just crawl onto the shore and get finished.

20:05.749 --> 20:10.719
So the fish has no discretion.

20:10.719 --> 20:15.198
But it has some innate knowledge to save itself
from dangers.

20:15.198 --> 20:22.719
Now you don’t have any innate knowledge
about it – how to save yourself from dangers,

20:22.719 --> 20:25.029
how to save yourselves from troubles.

20:25.029 --> 20:30.159
No innate knowledge like that – that you
are cautious, you shouldn’t walk this way,

20:30.159 --> 20:34.149
you shouldn’t go like this, you shouldn’t
give vibrations to somebody, you should not

20:34.149 --> 20:35.149
treat somebody.

20:35.149 --> 20:37.019
No, that’s not there.

20:37.019 --> 20:43.919
Innately you don’t have this knowledge,
that we should try to save ourselves, we should

20:43.919 --> 20:50.389
go from the right side, not from the left
side, it would be inauspicious, not so much.

20:50.389 --> 20:52.839
Still you always do right things.

20:52.839 --> 20:58.809
Whichever time you will choose will be the
right auspicious time.

20:58.809 --> 21:03.059
You don’t have to consult books on that.

21:03.059 --> 21:13.019
Like once it happened in Lonavala, we had
a puja, and it was to be at 10 o’clock as

21:13.019 --> 21:16.559
it was here.

21:16.559 --> 21:21.529
I wouldn’t go for My bath for quite some
time and they were quite upset – “Mother,

21:21.529 --> 21:22.529
what’s the matter?”

21:22.529 --> 21:23.529
I said.

21:23.529 --> 21:27.099
“It’s all right, let’s go ahead and
see” … was talking here, there, there,

21:27.099 --> 21:30.839
there… then I went for My bath at about
11 o’clock.

21:30.839 --> 21:39.309
When I come back it was 12 o’clock, the
sun had gone to the other side.

21:39.309 --> 21:42.599
So they said, er … they were little upset.

21:42.599 --> 21:48.169
I said, “Now, bring the panchar” – the
one which where all the timings are written

21:48.169 --> 21:49.519
about the moon.

21:49.519 --> 21:54.179
So till 11 o’clock there was amavasya.

21:54.179 --> 21:57.789
Amavasya is the day when there is no moon
in the sky.

21:57.789 --> 22:06.568
So I can’t take my bath in amavasya and
you cannot have puja otherwise, so I had to

22:06.568 --> 22:07.568
wait.

22:07.568 --> 22:08.568
They were amazed.

22:08.568 --> 22:11.419
They said, “We had consulted the panchar.”

22:11.419 --> 22:13.639
I said, “Which one?”

22:13.639 --> 22:21.378
And you see, they saw, they were surprised
that how is it that Mother could tell about

22:21.378 --> 22:23.579
amavasya and this and that.

22:23.579 --> 22:29.289
Because the discretion, the knowledge of discretion,
is built within you.

22:29.289 --> 22:37.929
So whatever you do, whatever way you work
it out, is built-in with you.

22:37.929 --> 22:40.139
You know how to do it.

22:40.139 --> 22:45.959
For example, for a human being, if you prick
him with a pin, immediately his hand will

22:45.959 --> 22:46.959
lift it.

22:46.959 --> 22:49.059
Who has told him to do that?

22:49.059 --> 22:50.639
Who has taught him to do that?

22:50.639 --> 22:57.239
No, in his consciousness it is built that
once you are pricked, immediately your hand

22:57.239 --> 23:01.438
will go out, automatically with a reflex action.

23:01.438 --> 23:08.948
So the reflex action to auspiciousness, reflex
action to your saving, reflex action to everything,

23:08.948 --> 23:11.459
is built-in within you.

23:11.459 --> 23:15.819
And once you become a Sahaja Yogi, immediately
you will start giving yourself a bandhan,

23:15.819 --> 23:17.499
you’ll start giving others a bandhan.

23:17.499 --> 23:22.979
You don’t have to think about it, a reflex
action, you will do whatever you will do,

23:22.979 --> 23:24.329
will be auspicious.

23:24.329 --> 23:27.169
Whatever you will do, will be beautiful.

23:27.169 --> 23:29.979
Whatever you’ll ask, will be beautiful.

23:29.979 --> 23:36.369
Like this place you got it and people are
amazed – how do we get it?

23:36.369 --> 23:39.889
But in the beginning you have to develop,
you have to mature.

23:39.889 --> 23:44.579
Unless and until you are matured, you do not
get that discretion.

23:44.579 --> 23:50.149
Like when we were trying to get a place in
London, I went with some Sahaja Yogis to find

23:50.149 --> 23:51.149
out the place.

23:51.149 --> 23:53.429
Now all kinds of funny places they were liking.

23:53.429 --> 23:57.999
I said, “The vibrations are so bad, these
people are not feeling any vibrations or anything.”

23:57.999 --> 24:02.129
I wouldn’t even get in the place, I’d
say, “No, no, no, no this is no good.”

24:02.129 --> 24:03.599
They said, “No, this has character, this
has that.”

24:03.599 --> 24:07.309
I said, “This character all that doesn’t
count with Me, you see.

24:07.309 --> 24:11.029
So they said, “But Mother, how are we going
to get a good place and…”

24:11.029 --> 24:12.379
I said, “We’ll get it.

24:12.379 --> 24:13.669
[And you…]

24:13.669 --> 24:23.719
I was traveling by a plane, in the plane I
opened a magazine and there I found Shudy

24:23.719 --> 24:24.889
Camp.

24:24.889 --> 24:30.889
When I went back, I said, “Now this is the
place for us, let’s go and have a look.”

24:30.889 --> 24:33.988
And there it was, and we found such a beautiful
place.

24:33.988 --> 24:41.539
So, we should allow, see, things to work out,
have patience, things will work out automatically

24:41.539 --> 24:46.399
because now the whole of the cosmos is with
us.

24:46.399 --> 24:50.659
The whole of the discretion of the cosmos
is with us.

24:50.659 --> 24:54.579
The vibrations that think are there.

24:54.579 --> 24:58.649
The vibrations that guide are with us.

24:58.649 --> 25:01.889
The vibrations that organize are with us.

25:01.889 --> 25:03.439
Let them organize us.

25:03.439 --> 25:10.549
We are playing into their hands by which we
are not bound, but we are helped.

25:10.549 --> 25:14.459
Like supposing you have a baby, you have to
look after the baby.

25:14.459 --> 25:18.669
But if there’s somebody, she says, “All
right, let me look after your baby.”

25:18.669 --> 25:19.949
She says, “All right.”

25:19.949 --> 25:22.459
Then you go to sleep.

25:22.459 --> 25:26.089
There’s somebody who says, “All right,
don’t you worry, I’ll make a nice bed

25:26.089 --> 25:27.229
for you.”

25:27.229 --> 25:28.229
So he says, “All right.”

25:28.229 --> 25:29.749
So they make a nice bed for him.

25:29.749 --> 25:34.199
Then you sleep there, there’s somebody to
cover you, nicely you are covered.

25:34.199 --> 25:39.869
Then they say, “All right, you have to now
go for your bath -see the bath’s ready for

25:39.869 --> 25:42.139
you, come along have your bath.”

25:42.139 --> 25:46.579
Then you want to have your puja -“All right,
there’s a nice place for you, come along

25:46.579 --> 25:47.579
have this.”

25:47.579 --> 25:48.589
You want to have an ashram?

25:48.589 --> 25:51.919
“All right, there’s a nice place for you
available, have it.”

25:51.919 --> 25:55.139
So it is not that you are bound by them.

25:55.139 --> 25:57.319
This is the point I am trying to make.

25:57.319 --> 26:02.139
But you are invited, you are treated with
great respect and regard and everybody at

26:02.139 --> 26:03.199
your service.

26:03.199 --> 26:07.339
You say, “Mother, You come in my head”,
I’ll come in your head.

26:07.339 --> 26:09.309
You say, “Come in my heart”, I’ll come
in your heart.

26:09.309 --> 26:12.749
You say, “Come in my hands”, I’ll come
in your hands.

26:12.749 --> 26:19.869
So the whole of the cosmos is at your service
as if you are on the stage now, doing the

26:19.869 --> 26:21.809
job for Me.

26:21.809 --> 26:25.039
Now to think that you are under bondage is
a wrong thing.

26:25.039 --> 26:32.250
There’s no bondage, on the contrary the
people who are ganas, who are angels, who

26:32.250 --> 26:37.899
are deities, are anxious to do whatever is
possible to please you, to keep you happy.

26:37.899 --> 26:45.989
If you say, “Now the Kundalini has to raise”,
all right they are all there to help you.

26:45.989 --> 26:51.319
Anything you want can be done, but first of
all what you need is maturity.

26:51.319 --> 26:57.249
And for maturity, one has to understand that
there is a culture of the spirit.

26:57.249 --> 27:06.249
As we have human cultures, we have culture
of the spirit which must be imbibed.

27:06.249 --> 27:17.319
The culture of the spirit is to be imbibed.

27:17.319 --> 27:27.279
If you go according to the culture of the
spirit, then you cannot have problems, and

27:27.279 --> 27:32.009
the foremost thing in the culture of spirit
is that you must respect yourself because

27:32.009 --> 27:36.289
you are an yogi.

27:36.289 --> 27:43.169
Second thing is you must respect other yogi,
because they are yogis.

27:43.169 --> 27:51.029
Like I have told you before in Ganapatipule,
there was one tailor, Namadeva, who was a

27:51.029 --> 27:59.819
saint and he went to see another one who was
just a potter.

27:59.819 --> 28:06.919
And the potter was mixing the mud with water
with his feet, he was working there when Namadeva

28:06.919 --> 28:09.809
went and saw him.

28:09.809 --> 28:16.829
He saw him and what he says, “Nirgunachya
bheti alo sagunashi”, meaning “I came

28:16.829 --> 28:23.119
to see here formless, the vibrations, the
Chaitanya.

28:23.119 --> 28:24.119
Formless – nirgun.

28:24.119 --> 28:29.619
I came to see a nirgun, meet nirguna [formless]
but here it is in sagun [form].

28:29.619 --> 28:33.369
You are the one who is in form of that chaitanya.”

28:33.369 --> 28:39.968
What a place, just think: one Sahaja Yogi
saying to another, “Oh God, I just came

28:39.968 --> 28:47.719
here to meet the nirguna, the nirachara, and
whom do I meet here is the saguna, is the…

28:47.719 --> 28:57.439
in the form, in the form, in you I see nothing
but Chaitanya.

28:57.439 --> 29:03.769
That is the, that is the respect of the another
yogi or understanding.

29:03.769 --> 29:11.789
Namadeva was an ordinary tailor and was not
a Brahmin, so he was not treated very well

29:11.789 --> 29:20.669
by other Brahmins, and he had to go to Punjab,
or it was said that he was called to Punjab,

29:20.669 --> 29:25.399
and he went to Punjab where Guru Nanaka saw
him.

29:25.399 --> 29:31.219
And Guru Nanak said that a great saint has
come to us.

29:31.219 --> 29:36.309
So He kept him with Him, and He said, “You’d
better learn Punjabi because here the people

29:36.309 --> 29:43.579
don’t understand Marathi so learn Punjabi
and make your poems in Punjabi language.”

29:43.579 --> 29:46.839
And he started making poems in Punjabi language.

29:46.839 --> 29:49.879
Now I’ve got Namadeva’s Gatha, so big
is that his book.

29:49.879 --> 29:57.310
Half of it is all Punjabi language and then
the poems he makes are so beautiful, they

29:57.310 --> 30:01.019
are sung in the Guru Granth Sahib they have
in the temple.

30:01.019 --> 30:08.679
You know in all these big temples of gurudwaras
of the Sikhs, they have Guru Granth Sahib.

30:08.679 --> 30:16.859
There the Namadeva is occupying at least one-tenth
of the Guru Granth Sahib and there’s also

30:16.859 --> 30:23.889
Jannabai, another maid-servant who was working
with this Namdev, her poems are also there.

30:23.889 --> 30:29.819
So how they were respected by each other and
how they understood each other was something

30:29.819 --> 30:31.119
so great.

30:31.119 --> 30:34.559
But now, it is just the other way around.

30:34.559 --> 30:43.079
We, the people who are false, who are wrong
type of people, who are making money out of

30:43.079 --> 30:49.968
God, who are deceiving people, who are bringing
all wrath and also all the negativity to this

30:49.968 --> 30:55.759
world, to destroy this world, are respected
by common people.

30:55.759 --> 31:02.559
But the Sahaja Yogis must respect another
Sahaja Yogi, till he is a Sahaja Yogi.

31:02.559 --> 31:07.159
As long as he is a Sahaja Yogi he must be
respected and understood, is very important.

31:07.159 --> 31:15.129
This is the culture of the spirit, in that
we respect all those who are spiritually higher.

31:15.129 --> 31:20.999
Like talking about God, we cannot say things
which are not proper.

31:20.999 --> 31:26.079
Like we cannot say that God is mischievous,
we cannot say.

31:26.079 --> 31:28.699
We are saints.

31:28.699 --> 31:31.119
We have to be very respectful to God.

31:31.119 --> 31:37.419
Any place which is sort of representing God
also must be respected.

31:37.419 --> 31:43.529
Everything that is godly must be respected,
because that is the culture of the spirit.

31:43.529 --> 31:59.399
It respects all that is godly, all that is
auspicious, all that is beautiful.

31:59.399 --> 32:02.429
In the culture, we do not see superficial
things.

32:02.429 --> 32:10.348
In this culture, we do not yield to anything
because it is expensive or it is with such

32:10.348 --> 32:13.449
pomp and show or publicity.

32:13.449 --> 32:21.529
What we see in this culture is how far it
is joy-giving.

32:21.529 --> 32:29.359
Even a small betel nut if somebody gives Me
with love, I’ll keep it with Me.

32:29.359 --> 32:34.449
And even if you give Me diamonds without love,
I have no value for them.

32:34.449 --> 32:38.989
They will be lost or they’ll be finished
– good for nothing.

32:38.989 --> 32:48.569
So the love that you put into everything makes
you a Sahaja Yogi.

32:48.569 --> 32:56.139
How you talk to each other, how you deal with
each other, how you look after with each other.

32:56.139 --> 32:59.869
How you communicate your love in a pure manner.

32:59.869 --> 33:05.189
Say a Sahaja Yogi should think, “Oh, I must
take this present for other Sahaja Yogis.

33:05.189 --> 33:10.869
I’m going there, then that I’ll meet that
Sahaja Yogi, he’ll be there and he’ll

33:10.869 --> 33:14.129
be there and…” just like your brothers,
see.

33:14.129 --> 33:19.359
“Ah, after such a long time I’ll be meeting
him, and it will be such a nice thing to meet

33:19.359 --> 33:26.949
him and talk to him and enjoy him and sometimes
also pull his legs and have a nice fun at

33:26.949 --> 33:27.949
him.”

33:27.949 --> 33:37.299
But the whole culture is of love, and if you
do not have that sense of love, if you are

33:37.299 --> 33:45.169
a dry person, or a morose person, or an unhappy
person, then remember you are not a Sahaja

33:45.169 --> 33:46.169
Yogi.

33:46.169 --> 33:55.279
A Sahaja Yogi has to be a smiling, enjoying
personality, making others happy.

33:55.279 --> 34:01.069
That’s the main attitude, main concern should
be.

34:01.069 --> 34:08.149
Next time I’ll be speaking about the spiritual
culture in Diwali when you’ll be there but

34:08.149 --> 34:09.149
this is the beginning.

34:09.149 --> 34:13.859
I have started talking about the new culture
that we have to accept.

34:13.859 --> 34:18.249
In expressing our love we should not be ashamed.

34:18.249 --> 34:22.939
We should not feel shy about it at all, we
are expressing our love and love must be expressed.

34:22.939 --> 34:28.699
There’s no harm in expressing our love.

34:28.699 --> 34:33.799
But it happens that in the beginning we feel
little shy, we are conditioned, how to express,

34:33.799 --> 34:39.019
people will misunderstand and they will think
that we are wrong type of people.

34:39.019 --> 34:41.859
No, we are special people.

34:41.859 --> 34:46.819
We have to make the whole world, they are
not going to make us.

34:46.819 --> 34:53.749
We have to create the new world and they have
to follow us, we are not going to follow them.

34:53.749 --> 34:59.549
We are the makers of kings and we are the
makers of queens and we are the makers of

34:59.549 --> 35:01.339
everything.

35:01.339 --> 35:04.199
So we have to work it out that way.

35:04.199 --> 35:11.629
We don’t have to bow to their ways and methods
but we have to patronize and look after them

35:11.629 --> 35:18.458
when they come to us first, try to treat them
as if a father would treat a son, and then

35:18.458 --> 35:25.149
bring him up, mould them and give them love
and make them understand that we are people

35:25.149 --> 35:30.429
of a very, very different domain, of a different
style.

35:30.429 --> 35:37.879
We are absolutely free people and are being
entertained by the Divine, are being looked

35:37.879 --> 35:43.679
after by the Divine, are being helped and
decorated by the Divine.

35:43.679 --> 35:51.679
Such a privileged place we have, so let us
be of that dignity and of that morality, that

35:51.679 --> 35:53.169
we stand up to that.

35:53.169 --> 35:55.939
How can we do something wrong to insult ourself?

35:55.939 --> 36:00.349
We cannot, we are yogijanas and we have to
be like yogis.

36:00.874 --> 36:03.164
May God bless you all!
