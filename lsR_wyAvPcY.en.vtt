00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:15.260
So today is the day when we have to introspect.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.704
So should we go into meditation, all of us?

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.376
Please close your eyes.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:26.087
All of you close your eyes.

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:31.742
Now we all will do the meditation the way we have been doing

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:37.133
 in the halls wherever we had public programs.

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:40.188
So the first you have to put your hand on your heart.

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:44.518
We'll work on the left hand side, and the left hand towards me.

00:00:44.598 --> 00:00:50.696
Now, first of all, you put your hand on your heart.

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:55.580
In the heart resides Shiva, is the Spirit.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.835
So, you have to thank your Spirit

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:08.275
that it has brought light to your attention,

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:13.070
because you're a saint and the light that has come in your heart

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.856
has to enlighten the whole world.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:20.722
So, please, now in your heart, you pray that,

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:31.255
"Let this light of my love of the Divine spread to the whole world."

00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:36.520
With all sincerity and understanding

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.709
that you are connected with the Divine

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.428
and whatever you desire will happen

00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:45.479
with full confidence in yourself.

00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:54.757
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:56.352
on the left hand side,

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:59.725
on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side.

00:01:59.805 --> 00:02:07.712
And now here is the center of your dharma.

00:02:07.792 --> 00:02:09.604
Here you have to pray that,

00:02:09.684 --> 00:02:14.826
"Let Vishwa Nirmal Dharma spread in the whole world.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:17.677
Let people see the light

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:22.820
through our dharmic life; through our righteousness.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.530
Let people see them and accept the Vishwa Nirmal Dharm

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.717
by which they get enlightenment and a benevolent higher life

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:41.129
and a desire to ascend."

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:49.810
Now take your right hand

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.084
in the lower portion of your abdomen of the stomach

00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:56.563
on the left hand side. Press it.

00:02:56.643 --> 00:03:02.447
Now this is the center of pure knowledge.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.961
Here you have to say as Sahaja Yogis

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:14.725
that "Our Mother has given us

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:20.705
the full idea how the Divine works.

00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:25.968
She has given us all the mantras and all the pure knowledge

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:31.218
that we could bear and understand.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:40.606
Let me fully be knowledgeable about that, all of us."

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.786
I have seen if the man is a leader,

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:45.146
the wife doesn't know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:46.967
If the woman knows about Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:48.709
the husband doesn't know anything.

00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:57.922
"Let me be proficient and an expert in this knowledge

00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:13.336
so that I can give realization to people,

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:22.628
make them understand what is Divine Law, what is Kundalini,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:26.019
and what are the chakras.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.685
Let my attention be more on Sahaja Yoga

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:34.162
than all these mundane things."

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.150
Now put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen.

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:44.185
Close your eyes. Now here on the left hand side, press it.

00:04:46.243 --> 00:04:50.557
Now here, "Mother has given me the Spirit

00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:54.445
and I have my own guru

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.844
which is the Spirit.

00:04:56.924 --> 00:05:00.982
I am master of my own.

00:05:01.062 --> 00:05:05.698
Let there be no abandonment.

00:05:05.778 --> 00:05:09.020
Let there be dignity in my character.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.403
Let there be generosity in my behavior.

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:19.262
Let there be compassion and love for other Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:20.376 --> 00:05:23.610
Let me not show off,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.630
 but have a deep,

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.008
deep knowledge about God's love

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.289
and His doings so that when people come to me,

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:40.211
I should be able to tell them about Sahaja Yoga

00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:43.481
and give them this great knowledge

00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:47.550
with humility and love."

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.335
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:00.753
Here you have to thank God

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:04.868
that you have felt the ocean of joy

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:10.974
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:15.732
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:19.289
which we have seen is so tremendous.

00:06:19.376 --> 00:06:23.478
Let my heart expand

00:06:23.558 --> 00:06:27.955
and encompass the whole universe.

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:36.073
And my love should resound the name of God."

00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:40.448
The heart, every moment,

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:47.047
should express the beauty of God's love.

00:06:49.593 --> 00:06:54.095
Take your now right hand in the Vishuddhi

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.663
that is on the left Vishuddhi,

00:06:56.743 --> 00:07:03.091
between the neck and the shoulder in the corner.

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:10.710
"I will not indulge into the falsehood of guilt,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.664
because I know it is falsehood.

00:07:13.744 --> 00:07:18.718
I will not escape my faults, but face them

00:07:18.798 --> 00:07:22.197
and eradicate them.

00:07:22.774 --> 00:07:27.201
I will not try to find faults with others,

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.272
but in my own knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:33.393
let me remove their faults."

00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:39.696
We have so many ways; secretly we can remove the faults of others.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.702
"Let my collectivity

00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:53.031
become so great that the whole Sahaja Yoga race

00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:55.969
is my own family,

00:07:56.049 --> 00:08:02.678
my own children, my home, my everything.

00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:05.420
Let me get that feeling

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.840
completely, innately built within myself

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.176
that I am a part and a parcel of the whole,

00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:15.702
because we all have one Mother.

00:08:15.782 --> 00:08:19.242
And let my concern go to the whole world,

00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:22.658
to know what are their problems

00:08:22.738 --> 00:08:27.015
and how can, through my true desire power

00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:29.263
solve that.

00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:34.313
Let me feel the problems of the world in my heart,

00:08:34.393 --> 00:08:43.811
and innately to remove all of them

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:49.553
from the basis of which they are,

00:08:50.382 --> 00:08:55.439
from the basis from which they are generated.

00:08:55.534 --> 00:09:00.024
Let me go to the principles of all these problems

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:04.280
and try to remove them through my Sahaja Yoga powers,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.466
through my saintly powers."

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:12.630
Now put your right hand on your forehead, across.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.562
Now here you have to say, first of all

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:22.154
"I have to forgive all those who have not come in Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:26.188
those who are on the periphery, who come and go,

00:09:26.268 --> 00:09:28.511
who jump in and jump out.

00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:32.492
But, first of all and foremost,

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.375
I have to forgive all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:35.455 --> 00:09:38.778
because they are all better than me.

00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:41.933
I'm the one, who tries to find faults with them,

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:47.122
but I am at the lowest ebb and I have to forgive them

00:09:47.202 --> 00:09:51.813
because I must know that I still have to go very further.

00:09:51.894 --> 00:09:55.369
I'm still much less. I have to improve myself."

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.961
This humility has to come within us,

00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.119
so you have to say here

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:03.266
"Let the humility in my heart

00:10:03.346 --> 00:10:07.597
in a true sense, not hypocritical,

00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:15.094
work out this feeling of forgiveness,

00:10:15.174 --> 00:10:25.080
so that I bow to reality, to God, and to Sahaja Yoga."

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.189
Now you have to put back your hand on the backside of your head

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:31.631
and push back your head here.

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:33.858
And you have to say here,

00:10:33.946 --> 00:10:38.454
"O Mother, whatever wrong we have done to You so far,

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:41.040
whatever wrong goes in our minds,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.953
and whatever smallness we have shown to You,

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:46.883
whatever way we have troubled You and challenged You,

00:10:46.963 --> 00:10:49.818
please forgive us". You have to ask for forgiveness.

00:10:49.898 --> 00:10:52.113
In your intelligence you should know what I am.

00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:55.837
I don't have to tell you again and again.

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:59.929
Now at Sahasrara you have to thank Me.

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:01.976
At Sahasrara, put your hand,

00:11:02.063 --> 00:11:05.160
move it seven times, and thank Me seven times,

00:11:05.233 --> 00:11:08.584
"Mother thank You very much for the realization.

00:11:08.664 --> 00:11:11.563
And Mother, thank You very much formaking us

00:11:11.643 --> 00:11:13.651
understand how great we are.

00:11:13.754 --> 00:11:15.191
And thank You very much

00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:17.649
for bringing all the blessings of the Divine.

00:11:17.729 --> 00:11:21.291
And thank You very much for raising us higher,

00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:24.315
much higher, than from where we were.

00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:27.729
And also thank You very much for sustaining us

00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:32.269
and for helping us to improve ourselves and correct ourselves.

00:11:32.349 --> 00:11:35.349
And thank You very much ultimately that Mother,

00:11:35.429 --> 00:11:38.057
You have come on this earth, taken Your birth,

00:11:38.137 --> 00:11:43.032
and working so hard for us, for all of us."

00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:49.675
Press it hard and move it hard.

00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:22.048
Now take down your hands.

00:12:22.128 --> 00:12:25.564
Heads are all very hot.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:29.525
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:34.486
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:39.153
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:42.082
Now again, second one.

00:12:44.782 --> 00:12:47.536
Now the third one.

00:12:51.703 --> 00:12:54.421
Now the fourth one.

00:12:57.922 --> 00:13:00.486
Now the fifth.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:06.076
Now the sixth one.

00:13:07.343 --> 00:13:10.554
And now the seventh.

00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:13.043
Now raise your Kundalini.

00:13:13.123 --> 00:13:16.303
Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

00:13:16.314 --> 00:13:19.193
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

00:13:19.179 --> 00:13:22.985
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

00:13:23.065 --> 00:13:24.680
one knot.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.791
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:31.246
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

00:13:31.326 --> 00:13:34.662
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

00:13:34.742 --> 00:13:36.933
Take it to your head, push back your head

00:13:37.013 --> 00:13:42.224
and give it two knots there, one and two.

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:43.657
Now let's do the other one.

00:13:43.737 --> 00:13:47.443
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:53.827
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

00:13:53.907 --> 00:14:01.072
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

00:14:05.017 --> 00:14:08.746
Now see your vibrations.

00:14:12.008 --> 00:14:16.302
See your vibrations like this

00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:21.739
All the children, see your vibrations like this. Put your hands.

00:14:47.412 --> 00:14:54.756
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:03.000
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
