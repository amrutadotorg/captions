2000-0425 Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey
Levent Kirca and Oya Basar Theatre

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.441
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:17.515
These are the days of greatest turmoil.

00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:29.899
We can see around us all kinds of calamities coming.

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:41.122
Also, what we find is

00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:45.778
human beings are not happy
with themselves and with others.

00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:59.040
That means, there is something basically wrong with us

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.646
that we cannot live in peace all of us together.

00:05:11.383 --> 00:05:13.708
We have no joy,

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:16.327
we cannot enjoy our life.

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:26.289
We are unnecessarily so miserable.

00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:35.467
Whether rich or poor, whatever may be the condition.

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:38.303
People are not very happy.

00:05:46.117 --> 00:05:48.260
What is the reason?

00:05:51.109 --> 00:05:56.196
Have we been created for miseries and troubles?

00:06:02.314 --> 00:06:05.761
To suffer from all kinds of diseases

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:09.311
and all kinds of infections.

00:06:19.293 --> 00:06:27.307
The nature also, the mother earth,
everything is not unison with us.

00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:40.958
The reason is we are not ourselves.

00:06:45.227 --> 00:06:51.546
It is very important as said by everyone
that you should know yourself.

00:06:58.015 --> 00:07:00.920
But how are we to know.

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:06.656
Now the time has come.

00:07:10.426 --> 00:07:14.219
In the Quran, it has described two stages,

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:18.267
one is the Qiyam (to stand up)
and another is Qiyamat (Doomsday).

00:07:24.636 --> 00:07:30.677
We can be saved and can enjoy the Qiyamat.

00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:40.216
Or we can be destroyed

00:07:43.498 --> 00:07:45.951
and suffer the Qiyamat.

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.473
So, this is the time of judgement.

00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:58.958
It is described in all the scriptures.

00:08:03.557 --> 00:08:06.104
Whatever you may believe,

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.780
whatever you may think, makes no difference.

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:21.020
Whatever place you live, whatever country you belong to

00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:24.055
has nothing to do with you.

00:08:35.372 --> 00:08:39.379
Now, how the judgement is going to take place.

00:08:43.102 --> 00:08:45.133
Within us lies,

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:49.590
a power that our creator has put in

00:08:49.615 --> 00:08:53.537
the triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:09:06.624 --> 00:09:11.000
This is the power which  is going to give us the

00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:15.510
higher state of existence when we know ourselves.

00:09:25.114 --> 00:09:33.296
Otherwise, we are lost in
the  mess of this worldly illusions.

00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:46.273
This is the power which in Sanskrit
we call as Kundalini.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:56.772
Because it moves like a snake, some people
also call it a serpent power.

00:10:04.814 --> 00:10:08.512
But this power is your individual mother.

00:10:12.605 --> 00:10:15.954
She has no other child but yourself.

00:10:19.383 --> 00:10:21.708
She knows everything about you.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.676
She knows what are your aspirations,

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:36.444
she knows what are your mistakes,

00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:44.756
also she knows what is the physical
mental problems you have.

00:10:50.866 --> 00:10:55.659
When you were born, your mother took
all the trouble upon herself.

00:11:04.526 --> 00:11:08.732
But, she did  trouble you.

00:11:15.315 --> 00:11:21.316
So, when this mother of yours
gives you your second birth,

00:11:21.365 --> 00:11:25.026
she takes all your troubles upon herself.

00:11:36.012 --> 00:11:41.938
I have come here to tell you that
you have this power, all of you.

00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:49.786
If it is awakened

00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:53.001
and crosses through the six subtle centres,

00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:57.307
passes through our sixth centre here

00:11:57.332 --> 00:12:02.987
it gets connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:22.233
Einstein has said that he was tired,
Einstein was tired

00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:27.430
trying to find out about the theory of relativity.

00:12:42.092 --> 00:12:44.116
And he got very tired,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.840
he went into his garden and started playing…

00:12:47.936 --> 00:12:51.025
started playing with the soap bubbles.

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:04.525
While playing with the soap bubbles, he says,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.800
I do not know from somewhere unknown

00:13:07.825 --> 00:13:11.637
the theory of relativity dawned upon me.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.398
He called it torsion area, in his own language.

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:33.506
Even you  the disciple for it

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.271
who discarded his master

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:42.207
and said that there is something beyond us,

00:13:42.232 --> 00:13:45.256
where we have to go beyond our mind.

00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:02.510
Because  this mind,
because this mind,

00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:04.695
reacts to everything.

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:12.739
It is all the time reacting.

00:14:16.235 --> 00:14:19.498
And that is how we are upset.

00:14:22.909 --> 00:14:26.044
These thoughts come to us

00:14:26.063 --> 00:14:30.618
all the time either from the future or from the past.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:42.217
But we cannot be in the present.

00:14:45.573 --> 00:14:48.255
One thought rises like this then falls on

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.409
another thought rises like this and falls down.

00:14:58.893 --> 00:15:01.527
But when this Kundalini rises,

00:15:01.544 --> 00:15:05.503
these thoughts elongate and
there is a space in-between

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:09.806
and that is the place where there is our present.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.733
So, we come in the present

00:15:29.724 --> 00:15:32.900
and reality is in the present.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.123
So you know the reality

00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:44.782
and you have the knowledge about yourself.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:52.354
How?

00:15:52.402 --> 00:15:57.841
Because when you get connected with this
all-pervading power, this divine power,

00:15:57.866 --> 00:16:04.786
your hands start emitting kind of
very nice cool vibrations.

00:16:23.517 --> 00:16:25.659
This is the Ruh.

00:16:27.524 --> 00:16:34.674
This is the divine cool breeze, of divine love.

00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:44.005
And in your hand on your fingertips,

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.420
you can feel your centres.

00:16:53.442 --> 00:16:56.474
That means your hands start speaking,

00:17:00.832 --> 00:17:03.988
that’s what Mohammed Sahab has said.

00:17:04.013 --> 00:17:09.698
That at the time of Qiyama, your hands will speak.

00:17:19.962 --> 00:17:22.827
So this is the time of Qiyama,

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:28.260
where thousands and thousands of people have felt it.

00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:40.834
If your hands don’t speak about your centres,

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:45.495
then I would not say you really are a Muselmann.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.525
This is said by Mohammed Sahab.

00:18:02.594 --> 00:18:10.071
So as a result what we should expect is
that our hands should speak,

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:24.764
so that we get the knowledge
about ourselves about our centres.

00:18:31.359 --> 00:18:34.211
We know about ourselves very well.

00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:45.125
Also, we know that this body of
ours is an instrument of God’s wish.

00:18:56.945 --> 00:19:01.957
Because now we are connected with the divine power.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:07.988
And we have all the knowledge
which is absolutely true.

00:19:18.254 --> 00:19:21.859
So, this is the path of absolute knowledge.

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:32.608
Supposing there is a man
who talks big and boasts,

00:19:32.637 --> 00:19:36.470
how are we to know that
he is not a hypocrite?

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:51.981
As soon as you put your hands towards that person,

00:19:52.007 --> 00:19:55.548
immediately you will know if it is hot

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.081
or sometimes even you  get some little little bit prickles

00:20:00.106 --> 00:20:02.775
then you know he is not a good man.

00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:22.187
Not only that but supposing
you are suffering from some disease

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:29.837
and you will not know it till you go through
the whole procedure of medical investigation.

00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:46.282
And also that they will not be very sure
as to what is wrong with you.

00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:57.139
But on your fingertips, you will know about yourself,

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.048
what’s wrong with you.

00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:12.601
You will be all in charge,

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:19.518
incomplete knowledge about yourself.

00:21:23.275 --> 00:21:28.287
And if you know how to correct your centres,

00:21:28.312 --> 00:21:31.480
you can correct the centres of others.

00:21:42.083 --> 00:21:45.154
Imagine what powers you have.

00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:52.755
For example, if this instrument is not connected,

00:21:52.817 --> 00:21:56.602
you won’t hear me and it is useless.

00:22:05.521 --> 00:22:09.252
But, if you are connected to the divine

00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:11.892
the energy starts flowing through you.

00:22:21.647 --> 00:22:26.417
But best is this power rises,
she passes through six centres,

00:22:26.442 --> 00:22:29.104
she enlightens them.

00:22:37.798 --> 00:22:40.242
She integrates them.

00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:48.009
Not only that, but

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.238
it informs you

00:22:53.453 --> 00:22:57.382
what’s wrong with you and you can correct it.

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:11.734
All your reactions stop.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.039
But you watch everything without thinking.

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:29.608
Like you become a witness.

00:23:32.693 --> 00:23:34.660
In that witness state,

00:23:34.677 --> 00:23:37.416
you know the truth about everything.

00:23:42.965 --> 00:23:45.163
This is so simple.

00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:51.868
All this can happen without paying for it

00:23:55.612 --> 00:23:58.987
because kundalini doesn’t understand money

00:24:01.843 --> 00:24:04.644
nor God takes any money.

00:24:06.806 --> 00:24:11.960
It is different if you have to book
the hall, we pay for it,

00:24:17.858 --> 00:24:20.532
but not for kundalini awakening.

00:24:26.113 --> 00:24:29.465
And you get your experience.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.023
It’s not just talking.

00:24:31.055 --> 00:24:34.453
It is the experience on your fingertips

00:24:34.485 --> 00:24:37.773
and out of your fontanelle bone area.

00:24:51.646 --> 00:24:56.188
There’s no question of blind faith.

00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:11.125
It is just the complete understanding

00:25:11.168 --> 00:25:13.869
within yourself, of your being.

00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:25.200
This is what is Qiyama,

00:25:25.224 --> 00:25:29.774
it is where you evolve into a superhuman being.

00:25:38.245 --> 00:25:43.070
This country was especially blessed by the Sufis.

00:25:48.184 --> 00:25:51.692
They had the experience of the divine

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:54.767
but they could not explain how get what it.

00:26:04.544 --> 00:26:07.194
But Mohammed Sahab has described it,

00:26:07.268 --> 00:26:14.322
that he was riding on a white horse,
which means the kundalini.

00:26:21.183 --> 00:26:26.419
And then he met Moses on the third heaven,

00:26:26.483 --> 00:26:30.551
which is true because we too know that all these

00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:33.857
prophets are on the third heaven.

00:26:44.499 --> 00:26:49.514
Whatever I am saying you can
verify after your realization.

00:26:56.843 --> 00:27:00.930
But as a result of kundalini awakening,

00:27:00.955 --> 00:27:05.149
all our enemies of anger,

00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:08.724
sexual misbehaviour,

00:27:09.966 --> 00:27:14.652
that all kinds of bribes, jealousies,

00:27:14.724 --> 00:27:16.448
all drop out.

00:27:31.606 --> 00:27:33.827
All the greed also drops out.

00:27:37.318 --> 00:27:39.445
Jealousies drop out

00:27:41.963 --> 00:27:44.359
because you are enlightened.

00:27:47.477 --> 00:27:51.889
In the darkness, you cannot see who is your enemy.

00:27:56.585 --> 00:27:59.553
But when you are enlightened,

00:27:59.572 --> 00:28:03.861
you know everything and you don’t do anything

00:28:03.886 --> 00:28:05.859
that is destructive.

00:28:16.396 --> 00:28:19.943
You drop all your destructive habits.

00:28:24.171 --> 00:28:29.265
And what comes in your heart is the joy,

00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:35.824
is the joy which cannot be described.

00:28:43.378 --> 00:28:49.163
For example, we have unhappiness
and happiness.

00:28:53.293 --> 00:28:55.300
Two sides of a coin.

00:28:59.856 --> 00:29:05.269
But after realization, you are in complete joy.

00:29:12.725 --> 00:29:16.454
And you become absolutely peaceful.

00:29:19.935 --> 00:29:23.157
Now what we need is peace.

00:29:26.077 --> 00:29:29.560
They are having so many peace conferences

00:29:29.593 --> 00:29:32.142
and spending so much money

00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:35.097
but they themselves are quarrelling.

00:29:43.888 --> 00:29:47.562
So what is the use of having those conferences?

00:29:51.797 --> 00:29:55.464
But you have to become peaceful within yourself

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:03.360
because you become very collective.

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:10.273
You develop the collective consciousness.

00:30:13.604 --> 00:30:15.651
Who is the other?

00:30:17.524 --> 00:30:21.912
You are the part and parcel of one god almighty.

00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:31.580
This house and can felt  for this hand,

00:30:31.657 --> 00:30:36.719
in the same way, we all feel
the same within ourselves.

00:30:45.103 --> 00:30:50.105
You’ll be surprised sometimes
we have a conference of people

00:30:50.145 --> 00:30:54.663
who come from sometimes eighty countries.

00:30:54.688 --> 00:30:59.018
Black, white, yellow, every colour.

00:30:59.062 --> 00:31:02.880
And there is no quarrel, no fighting.

00:31:20.395 --> 00:31:23.108
Thousands and thousands of them.

00:31:23.334 --> 00:31:26.159
They enjoy each other’s contrary

00:31:26.191 --> 00:31:28.286
and help each other.

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:38.111
You may be in Turkey

00:31:38.151 --> 00:31:41.237
but you will find friends in all the countries,

00:31:41.262 --> 00:31:44.244
your brother are there and sister are there.

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:54.794
You are no more alone.

00:31:57.458 --> 00:32:02.150
You can have them in every field of life,

00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:04.875
as your own brother.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.124
It is something we are not aware of ourselves

00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:19.986
that we don’t know how great our powers of love.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:32.284
That a drop which falls in the ocean
becomes the ocean.

00:32:32.378 --> 00:32:35.338
You also become the ocean,

00:32:35.354 --> 00:32:37.782
all your limitations drop out.

00:32:49.379 --> 00:32:52.989
This is what is going to happen to you tonight.

00:32:56.899 --> 00:33:00.835
I don’t know if I should ask you to ask me questions.

00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:03.786
But if you think it is important then ask,

00:33:03.802 --> 00:33:06.336
but ask something important questions

00:33:06.337 --> 00:33:11.087
because you shouldn’t disturb the people around.

00:33:40.583 --> 00:33:45.035
Another thing is, it will take hardly ten minutes

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:50.141
or fifteen minutes for you all to get your self- realization.

00:33:57.747 --> 00:34:01.913
If anyone doesn’t want it,
they should leave the hall.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.070
The only condition is that

00:34:12.095 --> 00:34:16.658
you should forgive everyone.

00:34:21.763 --> 00:34:24.047
Also, forgive yourself.

00:34:27.512 --> 00:34:32.044
Just you have to say I forgive
everyone in your heart.

00:34:37.459 --> 00:34:42.738
Don’t also think whom you have to forgive
but in general,

00:34:42.763 --> 00:34:46.689
you should  say I forgive everyone.

00:34:54.865 --> 00:34:58.293
Also, you have to forgive yourself.

00:35:01.806 --> 00:35:07.268
You might have done something wrong, doesn’t matter.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:14.311
That was in the past.

00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:18.577
We are in the present.

00:35:21.642 --> 00:35:24.723
Another thing is, that

00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:29.719
whether you forgive or
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:40.229
But if you don't forgive
then you play to wrong hands.

00:35:44.904 --> 00:35:49.713
So, now we will have the session for self-realization.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.597
For that, can I request all the cameraman

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:04.687
not to take any photograph and to keep quiet?

00:36:15.315 --> 00:36:16.782
Just for ten minutes.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.690
But when they will raise their hand

00:36:21.707 --> 00:36:25.853
saying they have got self-realization,
then we can take.

00:36:35.874 --> 00:36:38.881
So, please wait only for about ten minutes.

00:36:45.015 --> 00:36:48.580
Now, as I told you,

00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:51.433
you have to forgive yourself

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.547
and you have to forgive others.

00:36:53.595 --> 00:36:55.285
This is very important.

00:37:04.694 --> 00:37:11.094
What you can do now is, just to put
both your hands towards to me like this.

00:37:19.106 --> 00:37:20.962
Just like this, simple like this.

00:37:22.147 --> 00:37:25.895
Do it like you do for Namaz. Please do like this.

00:37:32.754 --> 00:37:34.261
Alright.

00:37:45.534 --> 00:37:51.052
Please again forgive yourself
and forgive everyone else.

00:37:58.704 --> 00:38:07.819
Now, you can bend your head

00:38:11.024 --> 00:38:16.319
and put your left hand top of your

00:38:16.376 --> 00:38:21.651
fontanel bone area which was
the soft on your childhood,

00:38:21.659 --> 00:38:25.106
on top and above.

00:38:33.895 --> 00:38:37.331
Now see, if there is a cool or hot breeze

00:38:37.356 --> 00:38:41.207
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

00:38:41.224 --> 00:38:42.558
please move your hand.

00:38:55.184 --> 00:38:57.264
Have faith in yourself,

00:38:59.209 --> 00:39:01.360
forgive yourself.

00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:09.799
Alright, now please put your left hand towards me

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:14.685
and with the right hand
please see, bend your head,

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:20.834
please see if there is a cool breeze
coming out your fontanel bone area.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.799
If it is hot, then

00:39:34.857 --> 00:39:38.970
you have not forgiven either yourself or others.

00:39:39.005 --> 00:39:40.845
So Please do that now.

00:39:54.376 --> 00:39:56.098
Alright,

00:39:58.086 --> 00:40:00.310
now again, once more,

00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:03.129
put your right hand towards me like this open

00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:05.209
and see with your left hand.

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.404
Bend your head and see for yourself

00:40:08.413 --> 00:40:14.259
is there a cool or hot breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:32.383
Now, please put your both the hands towards me

00:40:35.525 --> 00:40:40.730
and please don`t think,
can you do that, don`t think

00:41:10.759 --> 00:41:18.032
Now please see, if you are getting cool
or hot breeze on yourfingertips.

00:41:18.094 --> 00:41:20.157
It can be gentle

00:41:28.171 --> 00:41:33.051
or you are getting it on your palms

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.960
or out of your fontanel bone area.

00:41:44.513 --> 00:41:51.687
Anywhere if you are getting cool or
hot breeze please raise your hands,

00:42:06.263 --> 00:42:09.945
You all become sufis now. Congratulations.

00:42:11.172 --> 00:42:13.402
May God bless you.

00:42:18.664 --> 00:42:21.783
Turkey is a very Divine place

00:42:25.124 --> 00:42:28.814
and such a short time you got your realization.

00:42:32.592 --> 00:42:35.726
Don't doubt it please.

00:42:39.226 --> 00:42:41.293
Alright, take down your hands.

00:42:52.293 --> 00:42:59.416
I saw more ladies in the airport [UNCLEAR] you see.

00:42:59.506 --> 00:43:06.519
but I want men also to become realized souls,
very important.

00:43:15.736 --> 00:43:22.183
Now you will know what is
pure love, pure compassion

00:43:29.197 --> 00:43:35.459
because this is the power of
Divine compassion, Divine Love.

00:43:41.992 --> 00:43:44.143
May God bless you all.

00:43:47.935 --> 00:43:52.936
They will sing one song which we shold clap

00:43:52.984 --> 00:43:58.832
and you will see that these vibrations
of cool breeze will increase.

00:44:14.192 --> 00:44:18.167
For five minutes, you just feel again.
