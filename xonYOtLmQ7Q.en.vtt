Levent Kirca and Oya Basar Theatre

04:00.830 --> 04:05.441
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

04:12.658 --> 04:17.515
These are the days of greatest turmoil.

04:22.713 --> 04:29.899
We can see around us all kinds of calamities coming.

04:37.575 --> 04:41.122
Also, what we find is

04:41.181 --> 04:45.778
human beings are not happy
with themselves and with others.

04:53.068 --> 04:59.040
That means, there is something basically wrong with us

04:59.099 --> 05:02.646
that we cannot live in peace all of us together.

05:11.383 --> 05:13.708
We have no joy,

05:13.812 --> 05:16.327
we cannot enjoy our life.

05:21.818 --> 05:26.289
We are unnecessarily so miserable.

05:30.555 --> 05:35.467
Whether rich or poor, whatever may be the condition.

05:35.486 --> 05:38.303
People are not very happy.

05:46.117 --> 05:48.260
What is the reason?

05:51.109 --> 05:56.196
Have we been created for miseries and troubles?

06:02.314 --> 06:05.761
To suffer from all kinds of diseases

06:05.796 --> 06:09.311
and all kinds of infections.

06:19.293 --> 06:27.307
The nature also, the mother earth,
everything is not unison with us.

06:36.871 --> 06:40.958
The reason is we are not ourselves.

06:45.227 --> 06:51.546
It is very important as said by everyone
that you should know yourself.

06:58.015 --> 07:00.920
But how are we to know.

07:03.638 --> 07:06.656
Now the time has come.

07:10.426 --> 07:14.219
In the Quran, it has described two stages,

07:14.376 --> 07:18.267
one is the Qiyam (to stand up)
and another is Qiyamat (Doomsday).

07:24.636 --> 07:30.677
We can be saved and can enjoy the Qiyamat.

07:38.081 --> 07:40.216
Or we can be destroyed

07:43.498 --> 07:45.951
and suffer the Qiyamat.

07:49.291 --> 07:52.473
So, this is the time of judgement.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.958
It is described in all the scriptures.

08:03.557 --> 08:06.104
Whatever you may believe,

08:06.170 --> 08:09.780
whatever you may think, makes no difference.

08:16.909 --> 08:21.020
Whatever place you live, whatever country you belong to

08:21.048 --> 08:24.055
has nothing to do with you.

08:35.372 --> 08:39.379
Now, how the judgement is going to take place.

08:43.102 --> 08:45.133
Within us lies,

08:45.158 --> 08:49.590
a power that our creator has put in

08:49.615 --> 08:53.537
the triangular bone called as sacrum.

09:06.624 --> 09:11.000
This is the power which  is going to give us the

09:11.015 --> 09:15.510
higher state of existence when we know ourselves.

09:25.114 --> 09:33.296
Otherwise, we are lost in
the  mess of this worldly illusions.

09:40.821 --> 09:46.273
This is the power which in Sanskrit
we call as Kundalini.

09:50.930 --> 09:56.772
Because it moves like a snake, some people
also call it a serpent power.

10:04.814 --> 10:08.512
But this power is your individual mother.

10:12.605 --> 10:15.954
She has no other child but yourself.

10:19.383 --> 10:21.708
She knows everything about you.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.676
She knows what are your aspirations,

10:33.968 --> 10:36.444
she knows what are your mistakes,

10:39.161 --> 10:44.756
also she knows what is the physical
mental problems you have.

10:50.866 --> 10:55.659
When you were born, your mother took
all the trouble upon herself.

11:04.526 --> 11:08.732
But, she did  trouble you.

11:15.315 --> 11:21.316
So, when this mother of yours
gives you your second birth,

11:21.365 --> 11:25.026
she takes all your troubles upon herself.

11:36.012 --> 11:41.938
I have come here to tell you that
you have this power, all of you.

11:47.854 --> 11:49.786
If it is awakened

11:49.812 --> 11:53.001
and crosses through the six subtle centres,

11:53.026 --> 11:57.307
passes through our sixth centre here

11:57.332 --> 12:02.987
it gets connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

12:16.900 --> 12:22.233
Einstein has said that he was tired,
Einstein was tired

12:22.258 --> 12:27.430
trying to find out about the theory of relativity.

12:42.092 --> 12:44.116
And he got very tired,

12:44.140 --> 12:47.840
he went into his garden and started playing…

12:47.936 --> 12:51.025
started playing with the soap bubbles.

13:01.375 --> 13:04.525
While playing with the soap bubbles, he says,

13:04.560 --> 13:07.800
I do not know from somewhere unknown

13:07.825 --> 13:11.637
the theory of relativity dawned upon me.

13:21.270 --> 13:25.398
He called it torsion area, in his own language.

13:30.276 --> 13:33.506
Even you  the disciple for it

13:33.570 --> 13:37.271
who discarded his master

13:37.303 --> 13:42.207
and said that there is something beyond us,

13:42.232 --> 13:45.256
where we have to go beyond our mind.

13:57.857 --> 14:02.510
Because  this mind,
because this mind,

14:02.743 --> 14:04.695
reacts to everything.

14:10.009 --> 14:12.739
It is all the time reacting.

14:16.235 --> 14:19.498
And that is how we are upset.

14:22.909 --> 14:26.044
These thoughts come to us

14:26.063 --> 14:30.618
all the time either from the future or from the past.

14:38.169 --> 14:42.217
But we cannot be in the present.

14:45.573 --> 14:48.255
One thought rises like this then falls on

14:48.280 --> 14:52.409
another thought rises like this and falls down.

14:58.893 --> 15:01.527
But when this Kundalini rises,

15:01.544 --> 15:05.503
these thoughts elongate and
there is a space in-between

15:05.544 --> 15:09.806
and that is the place where there is our present.

15:23.710 --> 15:26.733
So, we come in the present

15:29.724 --> 15:32.900
and reality is in the present.

15:37.830 --> 15:41.123
So you know the reality

15:41.227 --> 15:44.782
and you have the knowledge about yourself.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.354
How?

15:52.402 --> 15:57.841
Because when you get connected with this
all-pervading power, this divine power,

15:57.866 --> 16:04.786
your hands start emitting kind of
very nice cool vibrations.

16:23.517 --> 16:25.659
This is the Ruh.

16:27.524 --> 16:34.674
This is the divine cool breeze, of divine love.

16:40.768 --> 16:44.005
And in your hand on your fingertips,

16:44.030 --> 16:46.420
you can feel your centres.

16:53.442 --> 16:56.474
That means your hands start speaking,

17:00.832 --> 17:03.988
that’s what Mohammed Sahab has said.

17:04.013 --> 17:09.698
That at the time of Qiyama, your hands will speak.

17:19.962 --> 17:22.827
So this is the time of Qiyama,

17:22.830 --> 17:28.260
where thousands and thousands of people have felt it.

17:35.142 --> 17:40.834
If your hands don’t speak about your centres,

17:40.859 --> 17:45.495
then I would not say you really are a Muselmann.

17:56.470 --> 17:59.525
This is said by Mohammed Sahab.

18:02.594 --> 18:10.071
So as a result what we should expect is
that our hands should speak,

18:17.831 --> 18:24.764
so that we get the knowledge
about ourselves about our centres.

18:31.359 --> 18:34.211
We know about ourselves very well.

18:34.243 --> 18:45.125
Also, we know that this body of
ours is an instrument of God’s wish.

18:56.945 --> 19:01.957
Because now we are connected with the divine power.

19:02.010 --> 19:07.988
And we have all the knowledge
which is absolutely true.

19:18.254 --> 19:21.859
So, this is the path of absolute knowledge.

19:26.131 --> 19:32.608
Supposing there is a man
who talks big and boasts,

19:32.637 --> 19:36.470
how are we to know that
he is not a hypocrite?

19:47.812 --> 19:51.981
As soon as you put your hands towards that person,

19:52.007 --> 19:55.548
immediately you will know if it is hot

19:55.580 --> 20:00.081
or sometimes even you  get some little little bit prickles

20:00.106 --> 20:02.775
then you know he is not a good man.

20:17.651 --> 20:22.187
Not only that but supposing
you are suffering from some disease

20:22.220 --> 20:29.837
and you will not know it till you go through
the whole procedure of medical investigation.

20:40.545 --> 20:46.282
And also that they will not be very sure
as to what is wrong with you.

20:53.449 --> 20:57.139
But on your fingertips, you will know about yourself,

20:57.150 --> 20:59.048
what’s wrong with you.

21:09.186 --> 21:12.601
You will be all in charge,

21:16.527 --> 21:19.518
incomplete knowledge about yourself.

21:23.275 --> 21:28.287
And if you know how to correct your centres,

21:28.312 --> 21:31.480
you can correct the centres of others.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.154
Imagine what powers you have.

21:48.611 --> 21:52.755
For example, if this instrument is not connected,

21:52.817 --> 21:56.602
you won’t hear me and it is useless.

22:05.521 --> 22:09.252
But, if you are connected to the divine

22:09.263 --> 22:11.892
the energy starts flowing through you.

22:21.647 --> 22:26.417
But best is this power rises,
she passes through six centres,

22:26.442 --> 22:29.104
she enlightens them.

22:37.798 --> 22:40.242
She integrates them.

22:45.105 --> 22:48.009
Not only that, but

22:48.640 --> 22:53.238
it informs you

22:53.453 --> 22:57.382
what’s wrong with you and you can correct it.

23:07.886 --> 23:11.734
All your reactions stop.

23:15.440 --> 23:21.039
But you watch everything without thinking.

23:25.759 --> 23:29.608
Like you become a witness.

23:32.693 --> 23:34.660
In that witness state,

23:34.677 --> 23:37.416
you know the truth about everything.

23:42.965 --> 23:45.163
This is so simple.

23:47.541 --> 23:51.868
All this can happen without paying for it

23:55.612 --> 23:58.987
because kundalini doesn’t understand money

24:01.843 --> 24:04.644
nor God takes any money.

24:06.806 --> 24:11.960
It is different if you have to book
the hall, we pay for it,

24:17.858 --> 24:20.532
but not for kundalini awakening.

24:26.113 --> 24:29.465
And you get your experience.

24:29.490 --> 24:31.023
It’s not just talking.

24:31.055 --> 24:34.453
It is the experience on your fingertips

24:34.485 --> 24:37.773
and out of your fontanelle bone area.

24:51.646 --> 24:56.188
There’s no question of blind faith.

25:04.941 --> 25:11.125
It is just the complete understanding

25:11.168 --> 25:13.869
within yourself, of your being.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.200
This is what is Qiyama,

25:25.224 --> 25:29.774
it is where you evolve into a superhuman being.

25:38.245 --> 25:43.070
This country was especially blessed by the Sufis.

25:48.184 --> 25:51.692
They had the experience of the divine

25:51.717 --> 25:54.767
but they could not explain how get what it.

26:04.544 --> 26:07.194
But Mohammed Sahab has described it,

26:07.268 --> 26:14.322
that he was riding on a white horse,
which means the kundalini.

26:21.183 --> 26:26.419
And then he met Moses on the third heaven,

26:26.483 --> 26:30.551
which is true because we too know that all these

26:30.567 --> 26:33.857
prophets are on the third heaven.

26:44.499 --> 26:49.514
Whatever I am saying you can
verify after your realization.

26:56.843 --> 27:00.930
But as a result of kundalini awakening,

27:00.955 --> 27:05.149
all our enemies of anger,

27:05.229 --> 27:08.724
sexual misbehaviour,

27:09.966 --> 27:14.652
that all kinds of bribes, jealousies,

27:14.724 --> 27:16.448
all drop out.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.827
All the greed also drops out.

27:37.318 --> 27:39.445
Jealousies drop out

27:41.963 --> 27:44.359
because you are enlightened.

27:47.477 --> 27:51.889
In the darkness, you cannot see who is your enemy.

27:56.585 --> 27:59.553
But when you are enlightened,

27:59.572 --> 28:03.861
you know everything and you don’t do anything

28:03.886 --> 28:05.859
that is destructive.

28:16.396 --> 28:19.943
You drop all your destructive habits.

28:24.171 --> 28:29.265
And what comes in your heart is the joy,

28:29.339 --> 28:35.824
is the joy which cannot be described.

28:43.378 --> 28:49.163
For example, we have unhappiness
and happiness.

28:53.293 --> 28:55.300
Two sides of a coin.

28:59.856 --> 29:05.269
But after realization, you are in complete joy.

29:12.725 --> 29:16.454
And you become absolutely peaceful.

29:19.935 --> 29:23.157
Now what we need is peace.

29:26.077 --> 29:29.560
They are having so many peace conferences

29:29.593 --> 29:32.142
and spending so much money

29:32.175 --> 29:35.097
but they themselves are quarrelling.

29:43.888 --> 29:47.562
So what is the use of having those conferences?

29:51.797 --> 29:55.464
But you have to become peaceful within yourself

29:59.964 --> 30:03.360
because you become very collective.

30:07.319 --> 30:10.273
You develop the collective consciousness.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.651
Who is the other?

30:17.524 --> 30:21.912
You are the part and parcel of one god almighty.

30:27.303 --> 30:31.580
This house and can felt  for this hand,

30:31.657 --> 30:36.719
in the same way, we all feel
the same within ourselves.

30:45.103 --> 30:50.105
You’ll be surprised sometimes
we have a conference of people

30:50.145 --> 30:54.663
who come from sometimes eighty countries.

30:54.688 --> 30:59.018
Black, white, yellow, every colour.

30:59.062 --> 31:02.880
And there is no quarrel, no fighting.

31:20.395 --> 31:23.108
Thousands and thousands of them.

31:23.334 --> 31:26.159
They enjoy each other’s contrary

31:26.191 --> 31:28.286
and help each other.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.111
You may be in Turkey

31:38.151 --> 31:41.237
but you will find friends in all the countries,

31:41.262 --> 31:44.244
your brother are there and sister are there.

31:52.659 --> 31:54.794
You are no more alone.

31:57.458 --> 32:02.150
You can have them in every field of life,

32:02.231 --> 32:04.875
as your own brother.

32:10.760 --> 32:15.124
It is something we are not aware of ourselves

32:15.149 --> 32:19.986
that we don’t know how great our powers of love.

32:27.100 --> 32:32.284
That a drop which falls in the ocean
becomes the ocean.

32:32.378 --> 32:35.338
You also become the ocean,

32:35.354 --> 32:37.782
all your limitations drop out.

32:49.379 --> 32:52.989
This is what is going to happen to you tonight.

32:56.899 --> 33:00.835
I don’t know if I should ask you to ask me questions.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.786
But if you think it is important then ask,

33:03.802 --> 33:06.336
but ask something important questions

33:06.337 --> 33:11.087
because you shouldn’t disturb the people around.

33:40.583 --> 33:45.035
Another thing is, it will take hardly ten minutes

33:45.060 --> 33:50.141
or fifteen minutes for you all to get your self- realization.

33:57.747 --> 34:01.913
If anyone doesn’t want it,
they should leave the hall.

34:07.300 --> 34:12.070
The only condition is that

34:12.095 --> 34:16.658
you should forgive everyone.

34:21.763 --> 34:24.047
Also, forgive yourself.

34:27.512 --> 34:32.044
Just you have to say I forgive
everyone in your heart.

34:37.459 --> 34:42.738
Don’t also think whom you have to forgive
but in general,

34:42.763 --> 34:46.689
you should  say I forgive everyone.

34:54.865 --> 34:58.293
Also, you have to forgive yourself.

35:01.806 --> 35:07.268
You might have done something wrong, doesn’t matter.

35:11.740 --> 35:14.311
That was in the past.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.577
We are in the present.

35:21.642 --> 35:24.723
Another thing is, that

35:24.819 --> 35:29.719
whether you forgive or
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

35:35.545 --> 35:40.229
But if you don't forgive
then you play to wrong hands.

35:44.904 --> 35:49.713
So, now we will have the session for self-realization.

35:55.810 --> 35:59.597
For that, can I request all the cameraman

35:59.630 --> 36:04.687
not to take any photograph and to keep quiet?

36:15.315 --> 36:16.782
Just for ten minutes.

36:18.730 --> 36:21.690
But when they will raise their hand

36:21.707 --> 36:25.853
saying they have got self-realization,
then we can take.

36:35.874 --> 36:38.881
So, please wait only for about ten minutes.

36:45.015 --> 36:48.580
Now, as I told you,

36:48.616 --> 36:51.433
you have to forgive yourself

36:51.450 --> 36:53.547
and you have to forgive others.

36:53.595 --> 36:55.285
This is very important.

37:04.694 --> 37:11.094
What you can do now is, just to put
both your hands towards to me like this.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.962
Just like this, simple like this.

37:22.147 --> 37:25.895
Do it like you do for Namaz. Please do like this.

37:32.754 --> 37:34.261
Alright.

37:45.534 --> 37:51.052
Please again forgive yourself
and forgive everyone else.

37:58.704 --> 38:07.819
Now, you can bend your head

38:11.024 --> 38:16.319
and put your left hand top of your

38:16.376 --> 38:21.651
fontanel bone area which was
the soft on your childhood,

38:21.659 --> 38:25.106
on top and above.

38:33.895 --> 38:37.331
Now see, if there is a cool or hot breeze

38:37.356 --> 38:41.207
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

38:41.224 --> 38:42.558
please move your hand.

38:55.184 --> 38:57.264
Have faith in yourself,

38:59.209 --> 39:01.360
forgive yourself.

39:05.069 --> 39:09.799
Alright, now please put your left hand towards me

39:09.834 --> 39:14.685
and with the right hand
please see, bend your head,

39:14.710 --> 39:20.834
please see if there is a cool breeze
coming out your fontanel bone area.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.799
If it is hot, then

39:34.857 --> 39:38.970
you have not forgiven either yourself or others.

39:39.005 --> 39:40.845
So Please do that now.

39:54.376 --> 39:56.098
Alright,

39:58.086 --> 40:00.310
now again, once more,

40:00.333 --> 40:03.129
put your right hand towards me like this open

40:03.154 --> 40:05.209
and see with your left hand.

40:05.220 --> 40:08.404
Bend your head and see for yourself

40:08.413 --> 40:14.259
is there a cool or hot breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

40:27.220 --> 40:32.383
Now, please put your both the hands towards me

40:35.525 --> 40:40.730
and please don`t think,
can you do that, don`t think

41:10.759 --> 41:18.032
Now please see, if you are getting cool
or hot breeze on yourfingertips.

41:18.094 --> 41:20.157
It can be gentle

41:28.171 --> 41:33.051
or you are getting it on your palms

41:36.500 --> 41:39.960
or out of your fontanel bone area.

41:44.513 --> 41:51.687
Anywhere if you are getting cool or
hot breeze please raise your hands,

42:06.263 --> 42:09.945
You all become sufis now. Congratulations.

42:11.172 --> 42:13.402
May God bless you.

42:18.664 --> 42:21.783
Turkey is a very Divine place

42:25.124 --> 42:28.814
and such a short time you got your realization.

42:32.592 --> 42:35.726
Don't doubt it please.

42:39.226 --> 42:41.293
Alright, take down your hands.

42:52.293 --> 42:59.416
I saw more ladies in the airport [UNCLEAR] you see.

42:59.506 --> 43:06.519
but I want men also to become realized souls,
very important.

43:15.736 --> 43:22.183
Now you will know what is
pure love, pure compassion

43:29.197 --> 43:35.459
because this is the power of
Divine compassion, Divine Love.

43:41.992 --> 43:44.143
May God bless you all.

43:47.935 --> 43:52.936
They will sing one song which we shold clap

43:52.984 --> 43:58.832
and you will see that these vibrations
of cool breeze will increase.

44:14.192 --> 44:18.167
For five minutes, you just feel again.
