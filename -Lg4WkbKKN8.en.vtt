00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.310
So today is a very, very important day, you know that;

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:17.596
because in the history of creation,

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:25.728
till the time of Christ, in the human awareness,

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:29.991
only the sense of resurrection was created

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.002
– that you can be resurrected or you can be reborn.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.659
That sense came down with them. People recognised it, that

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:46.149
it could happen to all of us, sometime.

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.368
But it did not happen.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.366
Actualisation never took place. That was a problem.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.338
And without you entering into the Reality,

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:08.821
whatever one may talk about, it sounds imaginative.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.199
So, one has to jump into the Reality,

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.184
into the truth.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.100
This never had happened before

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:23.326
and, as I have told you that,
if it had happened to one or two people

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:26.680
it makes no difference at all, to the masses,

00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:28.782
and nobody accepts it.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.414
And like the small little river flowing in the desert

00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:34.764
it disappears in the thin air.

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.801
The truth also, whatever was found out,

00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:40.121
never had any roots.

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:45.658
And all kinds of funny things started with this reality,

00:01:45.798 --> 00:01:49.322
which these people preached.

00:01:49.725 --> 00:01:59.422
So it was to be the culmination of human consciousness,

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:04.497
where he becomes one with the Divine.

00:02:04.638 --> 00:02:06.859
That he becomes one with himself.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.697
It was to happen.

00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:18.038
And that too was to happen at the time,

00:02:18.614 --> 00:02:22.383
which was most opportune, the best time.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:31.855
Because, unless and until the human desire is very strong,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.478
the human will is very strong and is asking for the Reality,

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:45.069
the Reality does not go into action.

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:53.914
Other things, of course, as far as the creation is concerned,

00:02:54.034 --> 00:03:02.029
creating the animals and all the trees and the fruits and flowers,

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.065
all these things are done.

00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:11.375
But the human evolution could not have matured earlier

00:03:11.672 --> 00:03:15.717
because there was not so much of seeking.

00:03:16.114 --> 00:03:18.415
So when the time came,

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.693
when the necessity was so great
that the necessity itself brought forth Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:38.919
And it happened that I really saw the Sahastrara.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.831
Of course, you know there’s a difference between
your Sahastrara and mine.

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:53.691
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is the Great Sahastrara,
opening out beautifully.

00:03:54.037 --> 00:04:04.988
And the petals were just like flames,

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:09.492
rounded flames; not like flames but rounded ones:

00:04:10.762 --> 00:04:15.541
rounded, beautifully coloured flames, of different colours.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.927
That’s why I wore today a blouse of many
colours and a sari of many colours.

00:04:21.335 --> 00:04:33.668
Because I saw so many permutations and combinations of these.
It opened out so beautifully.

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:38.046
And as if every petal was individually,

00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:43.085
absolutely complete and perfect, but so integrated at the base.

00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.125
And the way it opened out, and the movement,
was so rhythmic and so harmonious.

00:04:48.423 --> 00:04:52.269
There was no problem. Such a harmony was between them;

00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:57.668
no fluctuation anywhere.

00:04:58.738 --> 00:05:02.271
As if they were dancing to the tune, they opened out.

00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:08.516
And the colours, all spread out their light around the aura.

00:05:08.737 --> 00:05:14.836
And in the centre I saw the Agnya (inaudible),
or you can say the Sun colour,

00:05:15.044 --> 00:05:19.915
and all the chakras from there also emitting light.

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:25.188
But the chakras were darker in shades and they were emitting.

00:05:25.327 --> 00:05:29.851
So dark that they were all looking blackish, so dark.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:33.405
Sort of a condensed colour they had.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.147
And they were also emitting light all over.

00:05:38.346 --> 00:05:44.675
And the light, as soon as the whole thing opened out,
the light absolutely spread out,

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.848
and then I said “It’s done,” it can be done.

00:05:52.178 --> 00:06:01.780
So, first I had to open out my Sahastrara itself,
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:09.218
And then I felt that, a tremendous flow of my grace,

00:06:09.774 --> 00:06:17.266
started flowing. So much grace, even upon me.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:23.437
Like torrential rain on me.

00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:29.258
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy.
Really I was lost, absolutely lost.

00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:46.064
I felt that the whole Creation is now resounding
with that Universal Consciousness.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.926
Just like that.

00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:55.046
Everything was finished. Only the joy was permeating.

00:06:55.324 --> 00:06:58.637
It was such a beautiful time.

00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:02.506
And then I started my work.

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:09.014
But as you know, in the beginning,
it’s very difficult to talk about these things.

00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:16.097
To begin with it is very difficult for a person to say that
“I am such and such.”

00:07:16.257 --> 00:07:21.137
It’s a really embarrassing stuff.
It’s extremely embarrassing to tell someone.

00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:25.894
I mean if you have some power,
or something you feel shy to talk about that.

00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:29.704
You just don’t want to stand out and be singled out.

00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:35.569
You feel so lonely about it and
you don’t want to mention it to anyone.

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:38.454
I managed it for quite some time.

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.617
But when the Sahastrara opened out,

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:44.525
I knew that I will have to come out in my true colours.

00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:52.085
Of course, not yet, I have not yet come out
because that would be terrible. But, as it is,

00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:59.459
when the Sahastrara opened out
I realised that the instrument is now operative.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.867
So this Instrument that is before

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:13.442
you is the Instrument by which you are going to know the truth.

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:18.125
You can find out the truth now, through this Instrument of mine.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.617
Because through this Instrument
you will get your Kundalini awakened,

00:08:24.836 --> 00:08:26.919
you’ll get your Realisation.

00:08:27.297 --> 00:08:32.038
And through your vibrations you will be able

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.022
to know the Truth.

00:08:34.102 --> 00:08:41.364
You already know that the rapport between
you and the Truth has started.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:46.217
You can ask any question and you get the answer.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.923
So, first of all the Truth will be known,

00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:01.693
and that Truth, once you know,

00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:06.894
will be followed by another dimension of that Truth

00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:10.884
and another dimension. And I knew a stage will be reached

00:09:11.002 --> 00:09:15.944
where I will have to give the whole of it.

00:09:16.262 --> 00:09:19.563
And the whole of it you have got it.

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:24.741
But this Instrument has a special thing about it,

00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:31.646
because Sahastrara is, the essence of Sahastrara,

00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:36.805
is integration, is ekagrata.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.647
I have told you what is ekagrata:

00:09:43.138 --> 00:09:49.387
that is all the holes of all the needles if you put together

00:09:49.487 --> 00:09:55.422
and thread them together that is called as ‘ekagra’.

00:09:55.558 --> 00:09:59.325
‘Agra’ means ‘the end’, ‘ek’ means ‘one’.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.214
All the ends are put through one string.

00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:07.339
Now what does this means?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.394
In a very subtle way if we understand

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:14.740
that all the chakras are threaded into my Being.

00:10:18.946 --> 00:10:22.746
That means all types of patterns that have been created,

00:10:29.063 --> 00:10:36.661
all types of religions, all types of faiths,
all types of ideas, all types of enterprises,

00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:41.684
science, yogas, everything!

00:10:42.694 --> 00:10:46.185
All of them are threaded in this Being.

00:10:47.574 --> 00:11:03.036
So supposing you are a hatha yogi, then you have to just
ask question, “Mother, are you hatha yoga?” finished.

00:11:04.138 --> 00:11:12.042
If you are doing Raja Yoga, you just ask,
“Mother, are you Raja Yoga?”

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:17.597
If you are a Christian, just ask, “Mother, are you Christ?”

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:26.174
If you are a Muslim you just ask, “Mother, are you the Prophet?”

00:11:27.444 --> 00:11:32.027
Even if you are people who do not believe in God,

00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:37.080
[you] say, “Are You the Abstract Image?

00:11:37.646 --> 00:11:42.040
Are You Buddha? Are You Mahavira?” All of them are with me.

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:47.278
So that all of you, wherever you may be,
whatever you might have developed,

00:11:47.398 --> 00:11:53.370
nothing is wasted, but is given a proper meaning.

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:58.907
But with that meaning you will be integrated with others also.

00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:02.260
Because there’s One Personality, which has all these within.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:06.489
Like one thousand names of one Goddess.

00:12:06.665 --> 00:12:09.564
So automatically they will be integrated.

00:12:09.783 --> 00:12:13.364
You can be a Hindu, you can be a Muslim, you can be a Christian,

00:12:13.492 --> 00:12:16.538
if you want to call yourself something like that.

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:22.471
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you are all integrated.

00:12:23.025 --> 00:12:25.425
You can go to Church, if you want to,

00:12:25.684 --> 00:12:27.907
you can go to a Mosque if you want to,

00:12:28.046 --> 00:12:31.046
but you know who is the person who is there.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.047
Do you follow that point?

00:12:33.443 --> 00:12:37.494
This is the essence of Sahastrara.

00:12:38.566 --> 00:12:42.675
And for that reason we have to give up our misidentifications.

00:12:44.123 --> 00:12:46.941
Like if you say, “I am a Christian,

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:52.893
” then how are you a Christian? “I am Church of England,”
that’s not the way to understand.

00:12:53.112 --> 00:12:58.826
You are a Christian, alright, then you are following Christ,

00:12:58.926 --> 00:13:01.604
because I am Christ.

00:13:02.636 --> 00:13:08.169
If everybody is following one lamppost,

00:13:09.593 --> 00:13:12.510
you can say, then they are all integrating.

00:13:12.874 --> 00:13:16.842
You may seek from one angle another may seek from another angle,

00:13:17.034 --> 00:13:21.620
but by this integration you will realise

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:24.676
that the Light is the same.

00:13:24.835 --> 00:13:30.442
So all these years, the way
people have been fighting and quarrelling,

00:13:31.038 --> 00:13:34.238
all that is going to be absolutely neutralised.

00:13:34.866 --> 00:13:37.873
This is the beauty of integration.

00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:39.892
Anywhere in the world,

00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:43.017
whatever they are following can be answered.

00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:47.791
But supposing its some sort of a falsehood thing like voodoo,

00:13:48.208 --> 00:13:51.808
then I am not that. Of course not.

00:13:54.306 --> 00:13:56.250
I am not falsehood.

00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:58.507
Whatever is the Truth,

00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:03.809
whatever you have followed something
which is called as ‘truth’ – which is called, also.

00:14:03.948 --> 00:14:07.877
In the sense, like Christianity is not Truth,

00:14:08.184 --> 00:14:10.119
Christ is the Truth.

00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:14.682
But if you are a Christian and followed Christ

00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:19.146
in a false way, because following
pope is not following Christ at all.

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:23.861
Or say, becoming a Church of England,
this thing is not following Christ.

00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:28.564
But, if you have been following Christ even through
Church of England,

00:14:28.703 --> 00:14:33.921
it’s alright. Even through pope it’s alright.

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:38.484
Because now you have found out the Truth.

00:14:43.505 --> 00:14:49.483
So this was a very important and a crucial day
I would say, the 5th of May.

00:14:49.642 --> 00:14:53.907
And it all happened very dramatically, extremely dramatically,

00:14:54.066 --> 00:15:04.165
that I went to a programme, not a programme, but

00:15:04.582 --> 00:15:11.782
I went to find out about one of the horrid rakshasas’ places,
to see what sort of a thing he was about to.

00:15:13.947 --> 00:15:20.570
And of course I had made my own arrangements
and I stayed in a friend’s place.

00:15:20.729 --> 00:15:25.451
But I went to the camp to see what he was doing, what was he up to;

00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:31.636
in a very simple innocent way, he could never
have guessed that I was up to some mischief!

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.319
Extremely simple and innocent.

00:15:35.427 --> 00:15:38.415
I look so innocent don’t take me for that.

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:44.704
I am very clever! So I went down

00:15:44.804 --> 00:15:50.657
and the fellow thought me to be a great disciple
of his and all that. (laughing)

00:15:50.776 --> 00:15:54.208
Then I went to the seashore

00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:57.831
and I saw what he was up to, I was so angry,

00:15:57.991 --> 00:16:03.526
I said, “Now, what is it?” I said, “I must hurry up.
It has to be done now. It’s no more time needed.

00:16:03.665 --> 00:16:05.932
Because just see what is he up to!”

00:16:06.071 --> 00:16:11.745
He was working on a chakra which is to be worshipped

00:16:12.122 --> 00:16:14.940
and I felt that I must do something about it.

00:16:15.078 --> 00:16:22.444
And really it happened, that I could just open out the Sahastrara.
I said,

00:16:22.604 --> 00:16:28.325
“That’s it!” Because as you must’ve heard
that Goddess has no [purpose].

00:16:28.477 --> 00:16:32.045
She’s nishprayojana, She’s purposeless, She has no purpose at all.

00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:34.525
But, if the purpose comes in Her way,

00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:36.212
then She may do something.

00:16:36.312 --> 00:16:42.224
But She doesn’t have Her own purpose.
She’s absolutely purposeless, useless! Without any desire.

00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:46.886
Imagine! Without any attributes.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.366
What a thing and a half, whatever it is!

00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:56.358
Such a personality when It is faced with a demand like that,
comes up with it’s form.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.841
So now you understand from there that, on this Sahastrara day,

00:17:04.806 --> 00:17:07.373
you have to also demand.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:14.059
I want you to demand and ask, because I have no desire.

00:17:15.131 --> 00:17:19.832
And you just go ahead! You have all the rights to demand from me.

00:17:20.389 --> 00:17:27.172
And ask for the biggest and the highest
and the most fantastic and the most dynamic

00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:29.870
that you want to do.

00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:33.905
Put up your minds and heads together,

00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:36.663
and ask for something big.

00:17:37.338 --> 00:17:41.346
This is a very great day today. Go home, think about it.

00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:45.473
Collectively also you decide. I’ll go now, so then you decide

00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:51.465
and put a demand and it could be done! Now,
thy will be done, not mine.

00:18:38.916 --> 00:18:43.399
So, I will make a move now. I hope all of you will come on the 7th

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:46.594
and bring all your friends and all that.

00:18:47.328 --> 00:18:49.669
We might get a big crowd, I can’t say.

00:18:50.106 --> 00:18:51.847
But crowd is a crowd.

00:18:52.105 --> 00:18:53.934
Sahaja Yogis are Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:58.002
You might get a big crowd out of which, we put in them in the sea

00:18:58.101 --> 00:19:00.006
you’ll find only two remaining back.

00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:01.999
So sahaja yogi is different.

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:09.509
We might get a crowd. I don’t know depends on Caxton Hall maybe.

00:19:17.008 --> 00:19:19.271
Thanks to Caxton Hall Meeting

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:27.763
that my children have lost all their seats and all their ??

00:19:28.795 --> 00:19:33.061
Douglas Fry: I thought something would come of it.
Shri Mataji: Ha ha! You knew that.

00:19:33.204 --> 00:19:35.616
Douglas Fry: I knew something funny would happen, it had to!

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.995
There is a saying that ‘When the fox has to die,

00:19:39.184 --> 00:19:40.522
he runs towards the city.’

00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:46.435
Then they told me they are coming to the Caxton Hall I said,

00:19:46.693 --> 00:19:48.697
“Very good idea!” You see that’s a very good trap.

00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:51.276
And not a single person,

00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:59.453
all of them lost their vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: They went down (not clear)

00:20:01.603 --> 00:20:03.885
Even that...

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.687
You see hatred is not going to work out.

00:20:10.135 --> 00:20:14.591
It’s nice, in a way, this lady has also come, lets see,
she’s after all a woman

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.810
and we can work on her. Though she’s also with this crowd.

00:20:20.595 --> 00:20:23.976
Sahaja Yogi: She has a colossal of ego.
Shri Mataji: She has, for a woman, eh!

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:35.000
She does. I shook hand with her, raised her Kundalini
and with the speed with which it raised I felt wawa!

00:20:40.763 --> 00:20:43.709
I’ll raise her Kundalini all right. Don’t say.

00:20:44.305 --> 00:20:46.719
Not much hope from her but, you see.

00:20:46.858 --> 00:20:49.356
We might get a good group.

00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:51.687
There’s Lord Hailsham,

00:20:51.812 --> 00:20:55.552
I met him in a dinner very, very intimate dinner we had.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:21:00.123
Dr. Nagendra Singh was there and he told that
She is a very big spiritual leader of India,

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.985
this and that. He said,

00:21:02.105 --> 00:21:04.843
“If you want to know anything about Truth,

00:21:04.923 --> 00:21:09.389
She’ll be able to tell you”. He said, “I know all about the Truth”.

00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:12.053
So he (Dr Singh) asked me, “What do you know about this one?”

00:21:12.156 --> 00:21:16.012
I said, “His Kundalini is frozen down below there!”

00:21:16.217 --> 00:21:18.332
He was a very proud fellow, you see

00:21:18.451 --> 00:21:22.618
– “I know all about Truth!” Imagine to say that!

00:21:35.362 --> 00:21:38.945
Rustom: Should I take some vibrations from you?

00:21:39.135 --> 00:21:47.816
Lots of it left here. Nabhi, most of you have a left Nabhi….
