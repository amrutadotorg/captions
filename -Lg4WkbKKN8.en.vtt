00:07.080 --> 00:10.310
So today is a very, very important day, you know that;

00:11.787 --> 00:17.596
because in the history of creation,

00:18.436 --> 00:25.728
till the time of Christ, in the human awareness,

00:26.272 --> 00:29.991
only the sense of resurrection was created

00:30.230 --> 00:35.002
– that you can be resurrected or you can be reborn.

00:36.239 --> 00:41.659
That sense came down with them. People recognised it, that

00:41.954 --> 00:46.149
it could happen to all of us, sometime.

00:46.489 --> 00:50.368
But it did not happen.

00:51.160 --> 00:56.366
Actualisation never took place. That was a problem.

00:56.979 --> 01:01.338
And without you entering into the Reality,

01:01.566 --> 01:08.821
whatever one may talk about, it sounds imaginative.

01:10.775 --> 01:14.199
So, one has to jump into the Reality,

01:14.577 --> 01:16.184
into the truth.

01:16.759 --> 01:19.100
This never had happened before

01:19.458 --> 01:23.326
and, as I have told you that,
if it had happened to one or two people

01:23.446 --> 01:26.680
it makes no difference at all, to the masses,

01:26.977 --> 01:28.782
and nobody accepts it.

01:29.002 --> 01:32.414
And like the small little river flowing in the desert

01:32.621 --> 01:34.764
it disappears in the thin air.

01:35.003 --> 01:37.801
The truth also, whatever was found out,

01:38.115 --> 01:40.121
never had any roots.

01:40.797 --> 01:45.658
And all kinds of funny things started with this reality,

01:45.798 --> 01:49.322
which these people preached.

01:49.725 --> 01:59.422
So it was to be the culmination of human consciousness,

02:00.078 --> 02:04.497
where he becomes one with the Divine.

02:04.638 --> 02:06.859
That he becomes one with himself.

02:06.999 --> 02:09.697
It was to happen.

02:10.551 --> 02:18.038
And that too was to happen at the time,

02:18.614 --> 02:22.383
which was most opportune, the best time.

02:24.801 --> 02:31.855
Because, unless and until the human desire is very strong,

02:32.630 --> 02:41.478
the human will is very strong and is asking for the Reality,

02:42.133 --> 02:45.069
the Reality does not go into action.

02:48.383 --> 02:53.914
Other things, of course, as far as the creation is concerned,

02:54.034 --> 03:02.029
creating the animals and all the trees and the fruits and flowers,

03:02.645 --> 03:05.065
all these things are done.

03:06.295 --> 03:11.375
But the human evolution could not have matured earlier

03:11.672 --> 03:15.717
because there was not so much of seeking.

03:16.114 --> 03:18.415
So when the time came,

03:22.959 --> 03:28.693
when the necessity was so great
that the necessity itself brought forth Sahaja Yoga.

03:34.527 --> 03:38.919
And it happened that I really saw the Sahastrara.

03:39.990 --> 03:44.831
Of course, you know there’s a difference between
your Sahastrara and mine.

03:44.991 --> 03:53.691
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is the Great Sahastrara,
opening out beautifully.

03:54.037 --> 04:04.988
And the petals were just like flames,

04:05.516 --> 04:09.492
rounded flames; not like flames but rounded ones:

04:10.762 --> 04:15.541
rounded, beautifully coloured flames, of different colours.

04:15.660 --> 04:20.927
That’s why I wore today a blouse of many
colours and a sari of many colours.

04:21.335 --> 04:33.668
Because I saw so many permutations and combinations of these.
It opened out so beautifully.

04:33.934 --> 04:38.046
And as if every petal was individually,

04:38.212 --> 04:43.085
absolutely complete and perfect, but so integrated at the base.

04:43.661 --> 04:48.125
And the way it opened out, and the movement,
was so rhythmic and so harmonious.

04:48.423 --> 04:52.269
There was no problem. Such a harmony was between them;

04:52.468 --> 04:57.668
no fluctuation anywhere.

04:58.738 --> 05:02.271
As if they were dancing to the tune, they opened out.

05:03.301 --> 05:08.516
And the colours, all spread out their light around the aura.

05:08.737 --> 05:14.836
And in the centre I saw the Agnya (inaudible),
or you can say the Sun colour,

05:15.044 --> 05:19.915
and all the chakras from there also emitting light.

05:20.888 --> 05:25.188
But the chakras were darker in shades and they were emitting.

05:25.327 --> 05:29.851
So dark that they were all looking blackish, so dark.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.405
Sort of a condensed colour they had.

05:33.569 --> 05:38.147
And they were also emitting light all over.

05:38.346 --> 05:44.675
And the light, as soon as the whole thing opened out,
the light absolutely spread out,

05:45.290 --> 05:50.848
and then I said “It’s done,” it can be done.

05:52.178 --> 06:01.780
So, first I had to open out my Sahastrara itself,
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

06:02.376 --> 06:09.218
And then I felt that, a tremendous flow of my grace,

06:09.774 --> 06:17.266
started flowing. So much grace, even upon me.

06:17.525 --> 06:23.437
Like torrential rain on me.

06:23.775 --> 06:29.258
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy.
Really I was lost, absolutely lost.

06:30.052 --> 06:46.064
I felt that the whole Creation is now resounding
with that Universal Consciousness.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.926
Just like that.

06:49.335 --> 06:55.046
Everything was finished. Only the joy was permeating.

06:55.324 --> 06:58.637
It was such a beautiful time.

06:59.273 --> 07:02.506
And then I started my work.

07:03.003 --> 07:09.014
But as you know, in the beginning,
it’s very difficult to talk about these things.

07:09.451 --> 07:16.097
To begin with it is very difficult for a person to say that
“I am such and such.”

07:16.257 --> 07:21.137
It’s a really embarrassing stuff.
It’s extremely embarrassing to tell someone.

07:21.455 --> 07:25.894
I mean if you have some power,
or something you feel shy to talk about that.

07:26.014 --> 07:29.704
You just don’t want to stand out and be singled out.

07:29.968 --> 07:35.569
You feel so lonely about it and
you don’t want to mention it to anyone.

07:35.696 --> 07:38.454
I managed it for quite some time.

07:38.546 --> 07:40.617
But when the Sahastrara opened out,

07:40.736 --> 07:44.525
I knew that I will have to come out in my true colours.

07:44.585 --> 07:52.085
Of course, not yet, I have not yet come out
because that would be terrible. But, as it is,

07:52.263 --> 07:59.459
when the Sahastrara opened out
I realised that the instrument is now operative.

08:01.781 --> 08:05.867
So this Instrument that is before

08:06.027 --> 08:13.442
you is the Instrument by which you are going to know the truth.

08:13.666 --> 08:18.125
You can find out the truth now, through this Instrument of mine.

08:19.830 --> 08:24.617
Because through this Instrument
you will get your Kundalini awakened,

08:24.836 --> 08:26.919
you’ll get your Realisation.

08:27.297 --> 08:32.038
And through your vibrations you will be able

08:32.178 --> 08:34.022
to know the Truth.

08:34.102 --> 08:41.364
You already know that the rapport between
you and the Truth has started.

08:41.563 --> 08:46.217
You can ask any question and you get the answer.

08:50.940 --> 08:57.923
So, first of all the Truth will be known,

08:58.121 --> 09:01.693
and that Truth, once you know,

09:01.813 --> 09:06.894
will be followed by another dimension of that Truth

09:07.033 --> 09:10.884
and another dimension. And I knew a stage will be reached

09:11.002 --> 09:15.944
where I will have to give the whole of it.

09:16.262 --> 09:19.563
And the whole of it you have got it.

09:19.695 --> 09:24.741
But this Instrument has a special thing about it,

09:25.476 --> 09:31.646
because Sahastrara is, the essence of Sahastrara,

09:32.936 --> 09:36.805
is integration, is ekagrata.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.647
I have told you what is ekagrata:

09:43.138 --> 09:49.387
that is all the holes of all the needles if you put together

09:49.487 --> 09:55.422
and thread them together that is called as ‘ekagra’.

09:55.558 --> 09:59.325
‘Agra’ means ‘the end’, ‘ek’ means ‘one’.

09:59.450 --> 10:03.214
All the ends are put through one string.

10:04.723 --> 10:07.339
Now what does this means?

10:07.560 --> 10:10.394
In a very subtle way if we understand

10:10.554 --> 10:14.740
that all the chakras are threaded into my Being.

10:18.946 --> 10:22.746
That means all types of patterns that have been created,

10:29.063 --> 10:36.661
all types of religions, all types of faiths,
all types of ideas, all types of enterprises,

10:37.217 --> 10:41.684
science, yogas, everything!

10:42.694 --> 10:46.185
All of them are threaded in this Being.

10:47.574 --> 11:03.036
So supposing you are a hatha yogi, then you have to just
ask question, “Mother, are you hatha yoga?” finished.

11:04.138 --> 11:12.042
If you are doing Raja Yoga, you just ask,
“Mother, are you Raja Yoga?”

11:12.144 --> 11:17.597
If you are a Christian, just ask, “Mother, are you Christ?”

11:19.324 --> 11:26.174
If you are a Muslim you just ask, “Mother, are you the Prophet?”

11:27.444 --> 11:32.027
Even if you are people who do not believe in God,

11:32.464 --> 11:37.080
[you] say, “Are You the Abstract Image?

11:37.646 --> 11:42.040
Are You Buddha? Are You Mahavira?” All of them are with me.

11:42.279 --> 11:47.278
So that all of you, wherever you may be,
whatever you might have developed,

11:47.398 --> 11:53.370
nothing is wasted, but is given a proper meaning.

11:53.886 --> 11:58.907
But with that meaning you will be integrated with others also.

11:59.059 --> 12:02.260
Because there’s One Personality, which has all these within.

12:02.379 --> 12:06.489
Like one thousand names of one Goddess.

12:06.665 --> 12:09.564
So automatically they will be integrated.

12:09.783 --> 12:13.364
You can be a Hindu, you can be a Muslim, you can be a Christian,

12:13.492 --> 12:16.538
if you want to call yourself something like that.

12:16.777 --> 12:22.471
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you are all integrated.

12:23.025 --> 12:25.425
You can go to Church, if you want to,

12:25.684 --> 12:27.907
you can go to a Mosque if you want to,

12:28.046 --> 12:31.046
but you know who is the person who is there.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.047
Do you follow that point?

12:33.443 --> 12:37.494
This is the essence of Sahastrara.

12:38.566 --> 12:42.675
And for that reason we have to give up our misidentifications.

12:44.123 --> 12:46.941
Like if you say, “I am a Christian,

12:47.100 --> 12:52.893
” then how are you a Christian? “I am Church of England,”
that’s not the way to understand.

12:53.112 --> 12:58.826
You are a Christian, alright, then you are following Christ,

12:58.926 --> 13:01.604
because I am Christ.

13:02.636 --> 13:08.169
If everybody is following one lamppost,

13:09.593 --> 13:12.510
you can say, then they are all integrating.

13:12.874 --> 13:16.842
You may seek from one angle another may seek from another angle,

13:17.034 --> 13:21.620
but by this integration you will realise

13:21.725 --> 13:24.676
that the Light is the same.

13:24.835 --> 13:30.442
So all these years, the way
people have been fighting and quarrelling,

13:31.038 --> 13:34.238
all that is going to be absolutely neutralised.

13:34.866 --> 13:37.873
This is the beauty of integration.

13:38.038 --> 13:39.892
Anywhere in the world,

13:40.017 --> 13:43.017
whatever they are following can be answered.

13:43.141 --> 13:47.791
But supposing its some sort of a falsehood thing like voodoo,

13:48.208 --> 13:51.808
then I am not that. Of course not.

13:54.306 --> 13:56.250
I am not falsehood.

13:56.429 --> 13:58.507
Whatever is the Truth,

13:58.631 --> 14:03.809
whatever you have followed something
which is called as ‘truth’ – which is called, also.

14:03.948 --> 14:07.877
In the sense, like Christianity is not Truth,

14:08.184 --> 14:10.119
Christ is the Truth.

14:11.111 --> 14:14.682
But if you are a Christian and followed Christ

14:14.841 --> 14:19.146
in a false way, because following
pope is not following Christ at all.

14:19.774 --> 14:23.861
Or say, becoming a Church of England,
this thing is not following Christ.

14:23.981 --> 14:28.564
But, if you have been following Christ even through
Church of England,

14:28.703 --> 14:33.921
it’s alright. Even through pope it’s alright.

14:34.417 --> 14:38.484
Because now you have found out the Truth.

14:43.505 --> 14:49.483
So this was a very important and a crucial day
I would say, the 5th of May.

14:49.642 --> 14:53.907
And it all happened very dramatically, extremely dramatically,

14:54.066 --> 15:04.165
that I went to a programme, not a programme, but

15:04.582 --> 15:11.782
I went to find out about one of the horrid rakshasas’ places,
to see what sort of a thing he was about to.

15:13.947 --> 15:20.570
And of course I had made my own arrangements
and I stayed in a friend’s place.

15:20.729 --> 15:25.451
But I went to the camp to see what he was doing, what was he up to;

15:25.551 --> 15:31.636
in a very simple innocent way, he could never
have guessed that I was up to some mischief!

15:31.760 --> 15:35.319
Extremely simple and innocent.

15:35.427 --> 15:38.415
I look so innocent don’t take me for that.

15:38.633 --> 15:44.704
I am very clever! So I went down

15:44.804 --> 15:50.657
and the fellow thought me to be a great disciple
of his and all that. (laughing)

15:50.776 --> 15:54.208
Then I went to the seashore

15:54.684 --> 15:57.831
and I saw what he was up to, I was so angry,

15:57.991 --> 16:03.526
I said, “Now, what is it?” I said, “I must hurry up.
It has to be done now. It’s no more time needed.

16:03.665 --> 16:05.932
Because just see what is he up to!”

16:06.071 --> 16:11.745
He was working on a chakra which is to be worshipped

16:12.122 --> 16:14.940
and I felt that I must do something about it.

16:15.078 --> 16:22.444
And really it happened, that I could just open out the Sahastrara.
I said,

16:22.604 --> 16:28.325
“That’s it!” Because as you must’ve heard
that Goddess has no [purpose].

16:28.477 --> 16:32.045
She’s nishprayojana, She’s purposeless, She has no purpose at all.

16:32.145 --> 16:34.525
But, if the purpose comes in Her way,

16:34.645 --> 16:36.212
then She may do something.

16:36.312 --> 16:42.224
But She doesn’t have Her own purpose.
She’s absolutely purposeless, useless! Without any desire.

16:42.443 --> 16:46.886
Imagine! Without any attributes.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.366
What a thing and a half, whatever it is!

16:50.558 --> 16:56.358
Such a personality when It is faced with a demand like that,
comes up with it’s form.

16:57.350 --> 17:02.841
So now you understand from there that, on this Sahastrara day,

17:04.806 --> 17:07.373
you have to also demand.

17:07.869 --> 17:14.059
I want you to demand and ask, because I have no desire.

17:15.131 --> 17:19.832
And you just go ahead! You have all the rights to demand from me.

17:20.389 --> 17:27.172
And ask for the biggest and the highest
and the most fantastic and the most dynamic

17:27.371 --> 17:29.870
that you want to do.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.905
Put up your minds and heads together,

17:34.236 --> 17:36.663
and ask for something big.

17:37.338 --> 17:41.346
This is a very great day today. Go home, think about it.

17:41.565 --> 17:45.473
Collectively also you decide. I’ll go now, so then you decide

17:45.692 --> 17:51.465
and put a demand and it could be done! Now,
thy will be done, not mine.

18:38.916 --> 18:43.399
So, I will make a move now. I hope all of you will come on the 7th

18:43.678 --> 18:46.594
and bring all your friends and all that.

18:47.328 --> 18:49.669
We might get a big crowd, I can’t say.

18:50.106 --> 18:51.847
But crowd is a crowd.

18:52.105 --> 18:53.934
Sahaja Yogis are Sahaja Yogis.

18:54.014 --> 18:58.002
You might get a big crowd out of which, we put in them in the sea

18:58.101 --> 19:00.006
you’ll find only two remaining back.

19:00.066 --> 19:01.999
So sahaja yogi is different.

19:02.169 --> 19:09.509
We might get a crowd. I don’t know depends on Caxton Hall maybe.

19:17.008 --> 19:19.271
Thanks to Caxton Hall Meeting

19:19.410 --> 19:27.763
that my children have lost all their seats and all their ??

19:28.795 --> 19:33.061
Douglas Fry: I thought something would come of it.
Shri Mataji: Ha ha! You knew that.

19:33.204 --> 19:35.616
Douglas Fry: I knew something funny would happen, it had to!

19:35.780 --> 19:38.995
There is a saying that ‘When the fox has to die,

19:39.184 --> 19:40.522
he runs towards the city.’

19:40.761 --> 19:46.435
Then they told me they are coming to the Caxton Hall I said,

19:46.693 --> 19:48.697
“Very good idea!” You see that’s a very good trap.

19:48.876 --> 19:51.276
And not a single person,

19:52.517 --> 19:59.453
all of them lost their vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: They went down (not clear)

20:01.603 --> 20:03.885
Even that...

20:05.788 --> 20:08.687
You see hatred is not going to work out.

20:10.135 --> 20:14.591
It’s nice, in a way, this lady has also come, lets see,
she’s after all a woman

20:14.810 --> 20:18.810
and we can work on her. Though she’s also with this crowd.

20:20.595 --> 20:23.976
Sahaja Yogi: She has a colossal of ego.
Shri Mataji: She has, for a woman, eh!

20:28.759 --> 20:35.000
She does. I shook hand with her, raised her Kundalini
and with the speed with which it raised I felt wawa!

20:40.763 --> 20:43.709
I’ll raise her Kundalini all right. Don’t say.

20:44.305 --> 20:46.719
Not much hope from her but, you see.

20:46.858 --> 20:49.356
We might get a good group.

20:49.525 --> 20:51.687
There’s Lord Hailsham,

20:51.812 --> 20:55.552
I met him in a dinner very, very intimate dinner we had.

20:55.671 --> 21:00.123
Dr. Nagendra Singh was there and he told that
She is a very big spiritual leader of India,

21:00.270 --> 21:01.985
this and that. He said,

21:02.105 --> 21:04.843
“If you want to know anything about Truth,

21:04.923 --> 21:09.389
She’ll be able to tell you”. He said, “I know all about the Truth”.

21:09.471 --> 21:12.053
So he (Dr Singh) asked me, “What do you know about this one?”

21:12.156 --> 21:16.012
I said, “His Kundalini is frozen down below there!”

21:16.217 --> 21:18.332
He was a very proud fellow, you see

21:18.451 --> 21:22.618
– “I know all about Truth!” Imagine to say that!

21:35.362 --> 21:38.945
Rustom: Should I take some vibrations from you?

21:39.135 --> 21:47.816
Lots of it left here. Nabhi, most of you have a left Nabhi….
