00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:13.247
Today we have all gathered here for
worshipping your Guru.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:22.710
As you know that the principle of Guru
resides in the Void.

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:31.026
This is the principle which gives you
balance,

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:38.838
which gives you the gravity.

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:48.245
The gravity that we have in the Mother
Earth

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:58.641
is expressed through your Guru principle.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:07.965
The first point of gravity is

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:19.113
that you should have a personality,
a character and a temperament

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:33.941
that people would see that you are
a personality

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:41.165
who doesn’t get dissolved into worldly
things.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:55.545
Is a personality which doesn’t get ruined
by the skirmishes of life.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:02:06.844
Is the personality of a Guru which sits
down deep into his -

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:25.997
into his being and is not easily disturbed
or dissolved by

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:35.404
any solvent what-so-ever.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:44.594
This is the first principle of the Guru, is
the gravity.

00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:51.047
As I told you, it is something which cannot
be dissolved into anything.

00:02:51.248 --> 00:02:56.952
It settles very deep down into your
personality.

00:02:57.153 --> 00:03:01.569
So it doesn’t float in the water.

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:09.878
Now you see, in the countries which are
developed very much

00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:23.278
we think that we have a very great power
of individual attainment.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:33.108
That individually we are absolutely free,
we can do whatever we like

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:40.376
and that’s why individual freedom becomes
the goal of all democratic countries,

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:47.232
neglecting the collective. Of course,
individual is important,

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:51.824
and it has to become all right to nourish
the collective.

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:58.506
But if the individual does not have
the gravity,

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:08.858
then they float on the surface and anything
can impress them.

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:15.063
That’s why we find today people get
impressed by fashions.

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:25.782
By fashions, which by no logical reason are
good for your health, for your wisdom.

00:04:25.983 --> 00:04:28.279
[To somebody, "Sit down".]

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:39.311
No fashion is good for your health, nor for
your development as a personality.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:45.490
Sometimes you look so odd with it,
so funny, so stupid.

00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:50.579
Then this, ask your question, “What’s
wrong in becoming stupid?

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.934
What’s wrong in becoming foolish?”

00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:03.258
The reason is, you have an individual
freedom, but your personality has not grown.

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:07.458
You personality is zero. You have no
personality left.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.118
You cannot decide anything for yourself.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.313
Whatever is the fashion you just run after
that.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:23.593
Is this situation of the Western countries,
but in the countries like India now

00:05:23.794 --> 00:05:28.782
there are also in some sort of a craze.

00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:37.076
Because they have to still pass through
this so-called affluence that you have.

00:05:37.277 --> 00:05:40.152
So they'll take to the crazes, like
supposing

00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:43.486
somebody sees a very beautiful carpet with
someone,

00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:46.570
then all rush to buy that carpet.

00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:51.439
They’ll do anything for getting things
to themselves.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.476
So they turn towards materialism also
in the same way

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:59.888
as you people turn to fashions.

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:09.082
The individuality is all right up to
a point, but then it becomes a madness.

00:06:09.283 --> 00:06:16.397
Especially in the west the personality is
so low, is so missing

00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:24.252
that any entrepreneur can develop any
craze, any name

00:06:24.453 --> 00:06:27.806
and everybody runs after that and is
impressed.

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:32.415
Like a stupid fellow can call himself by
some name,

00:06:32.616 --> 00:06:39.817
say, he can call his… by some funny name -
now, say "Poison", as he says.

00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:44.604
Now to everyone to buy "Poison" is a very
great thing.

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:50.619
Because it is by some stupid man who has
taken a name and so everybody must buy that.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.680
It is nothing special about it. It is
nothing special,

00:06:54.881 --> 00:07:04.245
it is nothing – remarkable. It is nothing
that will make you something great.

00:07:04.446 --> 00:07:09.057
But people will buy that particular make,
because it has a brand

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:14.778
which everybody will accept. “Oh!
It’s from that particular brand.”

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:19.260
And it’s such a madness about it.

00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:24.184
Then comes to the anything from hair style,
up to your foot style,

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:28.679
to your neck style, to your nail style,
to your eyebrow style.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.801
I mean, anything, any stupid thing that you
could do to your body is available

00:07:34.002 --> 00:07:39.051
and people take to it because they have
no gravity in them.

00:07:40.367 --> 00:07:46.889
The persons who have gravity do not take
to such changes.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.428
First logically, they’ll try to know if
this change is good or not.

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:54.935
But only because it’s a change, it's
a craze,

00:07:55.136 --> 00:07:59.280
it's a fashion, they do not take to it.

00:08:01.503 --> 00:08:05.600
This is one of the signs of gravity in
a person

00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:13.669
that he doesn’t float on the ground like
straws.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:20.883
But it stays, it stays like a beautiful
pearl

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:26.957
in the deep shores of understanding.

00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:33.101
So those who are today here to worship
the Guru,

00:08:33.302 --> 00:08:36.399
they have to worship their own Guru within
themselves

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.692
and have to understand that first thing
and foremost thing is

00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:45.273
that we must have gravity in temperament.

00:08:45.662 --> 00:08:50.300
You do not need education for that,
university education.

00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:55.994
You need not read books, you need not
do anything.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:03.784
Only thing is that you have to have your
value system corrected.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:08.965
When your value system is corrected, you
understand

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:16.182
what is good for the society, what is good
for you.

00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:23.669
For example, if it’s a lotus flower, it
will never emit filth and dirt.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:29.881
The fragrance will be always there; if it
is a rose or any other fragrant thing,

00:09:30.082 --> 00:09:34.750
it will emit fragrance only.

00:09:35.372 --> 00:09:39.603
It cannot emit something that is filthy.

00:09:39.804 --> 00:09:44.664
Now those who think they are Gurus and have
achieved that gravity

00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:53.244
will never write something which is ugly,
say something which is dirty,

00:09:53.445 --> 00:10:04.467
will never use their mind to appreciate
anything that is filthy and wrong.

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:12.147
This is the second sign of your value
system.

00:10:12.348 --> 00:10:20.201
In your value system you have to first
of all understand what is auspiciousness,

00:10:20.859 --> 00:10:25.058
what is Divine beauty,

00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:31.805
and what is morality of the Spirit.

00:10:32.138 --> 00:10:38.902
These three things are to be realized and
are to be part and parcel of your being

00:10:39.103 --> 00:10:46.017
so that when people see you, they should
say, “Here is a person we can see

00:10:46.218 --> 00:10:53.873
who has that gravity, here is the person
who has that beauty.”

00:10:54.277 --> 00:10:57.799
It acts inside, outside.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.126
A person who has that sobriety inside
dresses up in a sober way.

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:11.612
He doesn’t dress up to impress others, or
just to show off or to hide something

00:11:11.813 --> 00:11:18.769
or to expose something. But just to respect
his body, he dresses up.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:23.699
When he talks to others, he talks wisdom.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:29.121
He doesn’t talk frivolous things, useless
things

00:11:29.322 --> 00:11:37.939
and things which are of very baser level.

00:11:38.817 --> 00:11:51.886
In his own enterprises, I would say, he has
a kind of a decency and a decorum.

00:11:52.087 --> 00:11:58.012
Like a person tries to become an expert.

00:11:58.213 --> 00:12:07.538
A person who worships his Guru, tries to be
an expert in his work,

00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:13.151
like supposing, there is a person who is
an engineer.

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:18.227
He doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care
for fame,

00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:22.549
he doesn’t care for applauses
from others.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:29.795
What he cares is, does he really understand
his subject matter. It won’t be mediocrisy.

00:12:29.996 --> 00:12:37.427
Musician has to be perfectly a musician.
Artist has to be a perfect artist.

00:12:37.628 --> 00:12:43.692
He does not use the general methods
of expertise,

00:12:43.893 --> 00:12:50.028
but his Spirit, the guidance of his Spirit
he tries to improve.

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:57.539
Like there’s a poet, he tries to improve
his poetry on the level of his Spirit,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.235
but not on the level of money, because
normally people would write things

00:13:03.436 --> 00:13:07.835
just to please the majority of the people,
so they can sell their books

00:13:08.036 --> 00:13:12.796
or something filthy which is not benevolent
to the society,

00:13:12.997 --> 00:13:18.617
nor to the name of the writer, they don’t
mind, they become shameless about it.

00:13:18.818 --> 00:13:26.198
So not that the Guru himself has the value
system, but through his life style,

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:32.909
through his own preachings, through his
own behavior

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:41.302
he radiates gravity to others – he radiates
gravity to others.

00:13:43.683 --> 00:13:49.367
So it builds up our value system, value
system of a balance.

00:13:49.568 --> 00:13:54.219
But it does not mean that if somebody wants
to become an expert on one subject

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.258
then he neglects the other side.
It’s in balance,

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:03.159
it has to be in balance, a person say,
for example, who is a musician

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:12.053
and cannot understand a painting – he is
not an artist.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:17.028
Supposing you are an artist and still you
do not understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:17.229 --> 00:14:20.301
then you are not a Yogi.

00:14:20.742 --> 00:14:28.528
So if you start from the central point of
your spirit, you’ll be surprised that

00:14:28.853 --> 00:14:37.177
the knowledge that you receive or whatever
you give is absolutely integrated

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:41.427
and radiates from one point.

00:14:41.975 --> 00:14:51.204
So, in every way you become an expert, in
any subject you become an expert.

00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:55.496
Anybody asks you a question, you know
everything.

00:14:55.697 --> 00:15:02.787
But in that you know what is worthless and
what is of worth.

00:15:02.988 --> 00:15:09.529
You try to understand what is important.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.888
You know, you give up whatever is worthless
and you would not like to know

00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:21.051
the names of different alcohols. You don’t
want to be expert in that.

00:15:21.252 --> 00:15:26.846
You don’t want to be an expert on knowing
all the names of all the carpet styles.

00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:31.732
You may not like to know all the varieties
of sarees.

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:34.889
You may not like to know all the names of
all the cameras.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:41.125
You may know, but need not feel that you
do not.

00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:50.907
But whatever is important for the gravity
of a personality, you will know.

00:15:51.108 --> 00:15:58.729
So if you want to make it simple, we can
know about auspiciousness.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:06.016
What is auspicious? You’ll know about
fair play.

00:16:06.217 --> 00:16:09.146
What is a fair play towards others.

00:16:09.347 --> 00:16:15.504
You’ll know about what is justice in
the eyes of God.

00:16:15.758 --> 00:16:23.764
You’ll know about the Divine music that
elevates your Kundalini.

00:16:23.965 --> 00:16:30.502
So as a result of this gravity you get
discrimination.

00:16:30.905 --> 00:16:37.512
That you know what is your personality and
what is the water surrounding you.

00:16:37.713 --> 00:16:42.230
You know how to discriminate and this
discrimination

00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:49.282
is also actually innately comes from your
Guru principle.

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:55.261
But once this Guru principle goes into

00:16:55.462 --> 00:17:02.330
a bizarre state or into some sort of
a turmoil or confusion,

00:17:02.544 --> 00:17:07.321
by so many other things like you have
a wrong guru, you have a false guru,

00:17:07.522 --> 00:17:15.002
you have false ideas, you follow false
doctrines, you follow false theories

00:17:15.203 --> 00:17:23.702
or you follow false books, then this goes
bizarre.

00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:32.305
As a result of that you develop Ekadesha
Rudra on top of your head.

00:17:32.506 --> 00:17:41.884
Also in case, when you have problems

00:17:42.085 --> 00:17:48.793
of not temperant and moderate life, if you
are an extremist,

00:17:48.994 --> 00:17:55.576
if you work too hard or you don’t work
at all or if you only go on

00:17:55.777 --> 00:18:01.528
projecting yourself into one side and not
paying attention

00:18:01.729 --> 00:18:04.996
to the other side of your life,

00:18:05.197 --> 00:18:10.436
with all these imbalances, physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual,

00:18:10.637 --> 00:18:15.011
you develop problems of your Guru
principle, as a result, you develop

00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:20.625
this Ekadesha Rudra, which is the beginning
of your destruction.

00:18:20.826 --> 00:18:25.405
So how important it is to look after your
Guru principle, you can see

00:18:25.606 --> 00:18:31.729
that most of the diseases are caused by
this principle, when neglected

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.932
and ultimately they reach its high – their
heights,

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:40.824
when it reaches the state of Ekadesha
Rudra.

00:18:41.025 --> 00:18:44.761
Now as realized souls you have crossed
the limit,

00:18:44.962 --> 00:18:52.606
you have come out of your Sahastrara, you
have transcended all those things

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:59.191
through your Brahma Nadi. But that does not
mean that you have developed that gravity.

00:18:59.392 --> 00:19:06.399
You have now achieved a state.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:16.682
If a flower is there and you put the flower
on the water it will float.

00:19:17.048 --> 00:19:23.450
But when it becomes the fruit and matures,
then you put it in the water,

00:19:23.651 --> 00:19:28.986
it does not float, it goes deep down, it
doesn’t get dissolved.

00:19:29.187 --> 00:19:35.794
It keeps its own identity. That is what is
to be done now

00:19:35.995 --> 00:19:44.186
that you have to become the fruits of
Sahaja Yoga, fruits of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:48.520
Blossom time is over now, you have
to become fruits

00:19:48.795 --> 00:19:55.703
and people who see you should know
that you have no imbalances at all.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:20:03.699
You are the people with special gravity.
So when you talk to people –

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:12.062
when you have any kind of Sahaja Yoga
program,

00:20:12.263 --> 00:20:16.095
you do not behave in a childish manner or
stupid manner.

00:20:16.296 --> 00:20:23.479
I’ve seen people sitting before Me raising
their Kundalini. It’s stupid.

00:20:25.694 --> 00:20:31.369
Or giving bandhan to themselves, is stupid.
So, even coming in the Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:39.103
one can have that kind of a stupid behavior
or behavior without gravity.

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:46.056
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you
have the same style as you had before,

00:20:46.257 --> 00:20:51.729
then you have to grow, mature, you have
to become still the fruit.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:21:01.800
And that is the sign that you become really
the Guru principle people.

00:21:03.272 --> 00:21:12.773
It is important that we have to know
the gravity of the Mother Earth.

00:21:12.974 --> 00:21:17.982
How she revolves with such a tremendous
speed

00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:22.490
holding all of us together to her heart and
then

00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:28.703
she emits her beautiful Divine love through
the various beauties

00:21:28.904 --> 00:21:34.323
that are surrounding us, now we can see
for ourselves.

00:21:34.524 --> 00:21:39.122
Specially when I see the big mountains,

00:21:39.323 --> 00:21:46.900
I feel they are like great saints sitting
and meditating here.

00:21:47.101 --> 00:21:54.526
But they are the only ones who can catch
the Guru principle emitted by the sea.

00:21:54.727 --> 00:22:03.589
As you know the sea is the Guru principle,
and they are so high

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:09.549
that they can catch the Guru principle. So
despite the fact you have that gravity,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:19.517
you are people of very high standards. And
you are beyond any temptations,

00:22:19.718 --> 00:22:28.350
any stupid ideas or any ideas that can
pervert or spoil others.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:36.000
You stand above everybody else, Stalwarts,
as we had very great people on this earth,

00:22:36.201 --> 00:22:40.924
I have given you the names and we said that
there have been ten Gurus,

00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:47.815
starting from Adi Nath, we had Confucius,
we had Socrates

00:22:48.016 --> 00:22:51.899
and later on we had Abraham, Moses and also

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.725
up to Shirdi Sai Nath, we had about ten
great Gurus.

00:22:57.926 --> 00:23:02.228
Now we have so many here sitting down, they
are all Gurus

00:23:02.429 --> 00:23:07.891
and they have to behave like Gurus and
they have to do the job of great Gurus.

00:23:08.092 --> 00:23:13.929
And this is what today we have to see if we
can develop that gravity within ourselves

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:22.934
and understanding within ourselves. When
that peace resides within you,

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:30.142
the joy of becoming Sahaja Yogis will be
really felt,

00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:36.158
will be really understood and will be
enjoyed by all of you.

00:23:36.359 --> 00:23:39.916
May God bless you all!

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.558
Here is a symbol of a dog because the Guru
always carries a dog

00:23:57.759 --> 00:24:01.876
because he is the one who knows only one
master.

00:24:02.077 --> 00:24:07.218
And this is the disciple principle of
the Guru.

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:14.363
So the disciple principle is like a dog,
who guards the Guru,

00:24:14.564 --> 00:24:21.427
who shows complete devotion and dedication
and all the time on the watch

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:26.167
that wrong type of people should not come
to the Guru.

00:24:26.368 --> 00:24:29.018
But on the contrary, I think sometimes in
Sahaja Yoga

00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:33.075
people always bring wrong type of people
to Me.

00:24:33.276 --> 00:24:36.855
It watches and it knows, it has such
discretion.

00:24:37.056 --> 00:24:41.599
It knows what to do and how to behave.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.229
This is what is the symbol of a disciple

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:53.690
and so this symbol has to be understood
by all of you.

00:25:01.136 --> 00:25:05.307
Now for the puja today you sit in a very
surrendering mood

00:25:05.508 --> 00:25:08.661
so that this principle awakens within you.

00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:11.628
Nobody should try to raise the Kundalini
or do anything,

00:25:11.812 --> 00:25:17.848
everything will work out smoothly and
nicely and nobody should stand up.

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:21.163
Everybody should be seated, whichever way
you like.

00:25:21.364 --> 00:25:29.360
That's important because as I said this is
the gravity, to settle down, to settle down.

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:36.909
That's very important, as we call Gruhastha
means the one who settles in the household

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:42.597
is the Gruhastha or we call it in Indian
language as the baithak,

00:25:42.798 --> 00:25:49.422
is the sitting capacity, how much you can
sit down on things.

00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:55.338
This child, you better ask the child to go
away. Whose child is this one?

00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:59.587
Is very disturbing… one second to that
child, yes.

00:25:59.788 --> 00:26:03.538
Just speak him up, that’s all, he’s
the disturbing one … I don't know...

00:26:03.739 --> 00:26:09.188
Let him sit outside, then he will be
alright. He’s alright.

00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:12.229
Sometimes something goes wrong with
them, you see…

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:17.909
These two girls - they should pay
attention. Children should not...

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.065
These two girls there - they should pay
attention, that’s important,

00:26:21.266 --> 00:26:26.445
because that’s how they are going to be
helped.
