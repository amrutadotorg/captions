00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:12.319
So, actually, we bow to innocence within us.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.810
And this innocence is the one

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.531
which gives you the enlightenment.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.195
As I told you yesterday, the light has innocence.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.751
But this is innocent without knowledge.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.837
But your light is innocent with knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.202
We always think that the people who&nbsp;have got knowledge

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:58.715
can never be innocent,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.466
can never be simple.

00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:06.596
And the idea we have got about innocense is that

00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:10.760
an innocent person&nbsp;is always deceived

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.289
can be befoodled,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.676
and can be always taken for granted.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.839
But innocence is a power.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.000
It is a power which protects you,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.430
which gives you light of&nbsp;knowledge. 

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:41.333
Knowledge that we have,in the worldly sense,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.495
 is how to exploit others

00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:50.000
how to cheat others, how to make money out of them,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.980
how to make fun of others,

00:01:54.132 --> 00:01:57.706
how to look down upon others.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.513
But the light of innocence is the light by&nbsp;
which you know

00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:11.763
that love is the highest thing.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.705
And it teaches you how to love others,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.722
how to&nbsp;care for others,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.578
how to be gentle about others.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.700
It also gives you the light&nbsp;within.
It's just the other way round

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.246
of this 'avidya' (false knowledge) 
that we have in this world.

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:36.175
Just&nbsp;the other way around.

00:02:36.175 --> 00:02:43.430
The 'avidya' (false knowledge) outside
 teaches us competition,

00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:50.717
how to put the other person&nbsp;down.

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.258
Because it has fear.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.679
it is insecured.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.746
This knowledge&nbsp;
is not secured at all.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.516
If it had security, it would&nbsp;
not have behaved like this.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.163
But the light of innocence knows everything.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.639
It has no fear.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.173
When we say, "Children are innocent"

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:31.267
we mean to&nbsp;say that
they have that power of innocence.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.927
Many times, people have noticed,
if a child falls from a height, &nbsp;he doesn't die.

00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:45.197
 While a young man&nbsp;may die
 with a much smaller height.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.355
And the child is not afraid while falling.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.867
He just enjoys as if-

00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:57.308
as if there's a&nbsp;parachute
 coming down nicely.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.167
And then when he falls down also&nbsp;
just gets up, laugh, smiles at everyone.&nbsp;

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.446
He doesn't understand why everybody is worried.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.833
Because in that, in a sense, he&nbsp;
knows that he's looked after.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.124
He is protected. He knows that there&nbsp;
is a power which is much higher&nbsp;than him.

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:25.206
And he does not have to worry.

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:30.000
Then we&nbsp;start putting ideas 
into the head of the child.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.677
And that is how he starts&nbsp;
losing his power of innocence.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.384
And he becomes a coward.

00:04:42.384 --> 00:04:45.778
He becomes a cunning&nbsp;fellow.

00:04:45.778 --> 00:04:50.299
He becomes an unrighteous personality.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:04.455
But still, we would say that the innocence&nbsp;
of children is innocense of ignorance, in a way,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.756
because they do not know the dangers of life.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.661
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.355
and also knows how to get rid of it,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.412
also knows how to be away from such a person.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:41.742
There was a wise man who was going on a staircase.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:48.473
And there was a stupid man coming&nbsp;
from the other side, a foolish man.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:52.676
So, foolish people are always aggressive. &nbsp;
That is one of the signs.

00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:56.037
Because they have an inferiority complex.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.880
So, the foolish man says to&nbsp;
the man who was coming up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.000
he says, "One had to move one one side".

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.179
So, he says, "I don't move for fools", the foolish one says.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.918
So, the wise man says, "I do" and he moved.

00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:32.170
That's how the light of innocence tells you&nbsp;
how far to go with a person,

00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:36.315
how far to talk to a person,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:42.562
how far to indulge in another person's&nbsp;
personality or his problems.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.000
Otherwise, he recides.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.753
He understands that this gentleman is a&nbsp;
stupid fool, "So, I move for a fool", like that.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.262
He doesn't pay attention to such a person.

00:06:55.262 --> 00:06:57.986
He doesn't bother about such a person.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.471
This is the light of innocence which gives&nbsp;
you discrimination,

00:07:04.656 --> 00:07:07.069
how far to go with others.
