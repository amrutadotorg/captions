Final Talk
Sydney, Australia

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.729
April 19, 1991

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:56.890
… now because there’ll be so many Sahaja
yogis here and it will work out, not only

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:04.420
for Sydney, but other places, like New Castle
was a surprise. You’ve seen New Castle how

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:11.420
it worked out. You have to go to other, smaller
places which are around.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:25.680
So, we have to know that Sydney people who
are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and we have

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:37.149
to strengthen ourselves by meditating also
and also by spreading Sahaja Yoga across.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:46.040
But more if you start paying attention more
to the defects here and the defects there,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.660
then you’ll never grow. What you have to
see is defects within yourself, and it will

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:57.660
definitely grow very well. The best way is
to grow yourself and become something that

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:06.910
we can say is a solid Sahaja yogi. That’s
much more important, I would say, for all

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.529
of you.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:18.529
You can always write to Me. And I always take
heed of that, and I work out many things even

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:25.980
before you have written to Me. So, there’s
no need to be frightened of someone, or to

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:34.550
be afraid of someone. You can always tell
that person what you think. And nobody will

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.660
now throw away anyone from Sahaja Yoga without
asking Me. It’s a law.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:47.660
Nobody is going to be thrown out. But, of
course, always I’ll have your photographs

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:57.630
with Me. And I know you very well. There’s
nothing to be told. But when I am busy with

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:06.940
other people, you should know that Mother
has given such a responsibility on us, we

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:14.540
have to grow and let everyone grow. And gradually,
I’m sure, everything will be all right.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:26.540
And so far we have had mishaps, not so much
because of leaders but because of you people,

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:34.399
because you should have told Me and you should
have informed Me. Also, I know we are very

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:44.149
capable people here, but still people don’t
meditate. That’s why I find they are catching.

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:54.629
Once you have got your realization, you should
know what should be the attitude towards yourself.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:04.560
Now we have a Sahaja culture as you know,
and we have to come into that Sahaja culture.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.060
And when we …

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:13.060
Ah! Hey, what are you doing? Bad. No. Ah ah.
At this age they pick up these things here,

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:35.589
so what do you say of children?
Whose child is this? Just take him. You must

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:42.579
correct, yourself. At this age you must correct
. Maybe later on no, but at this age you must

00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:48.810
correct. You see if they hit, then you hit
them on their hands. Hit where their legs.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.389
Hit them there so they are all right.

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:59.389
Now come along, now what’s your name? Hallo?
What’s your name? Such a Right Agnya. Very

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:10.790
bright Agnya he has, and also see his eyes
are showing the reason.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:21.180
Gradually everything will be all right. You
have to be grown in Sahaj culture. And also

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:28.079
the women have to grow in Sahaj culture; men
have to grow in Sahaj culture. And the women

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:32.680
have to grow in a Sahaj culture is this, that
you should not answer back your husbands at

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.199
all. That’s not the way you can conquer
him.

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:38.870
They do not understand how they can conquer
their husbands.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:45.600
That’s the main point. Not by answering
them back. Not by torturing them, but by bearing

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.600
up whatever they are saying. And explosiveness
of women is absolutely wrong. That puts them

00:13:53.529 --> 00:14:00.529
off. They come from outside; they are very
tired. And they are themselves in explosive

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:08.949
condition. And then you suddenly do something
to them and they start being explosive. You

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.019
see?

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:16.980
So women, if they cannot run their husbands
and family, all right. Then I think it is

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.899
their responsibility. So the responsibility
is much more on women than on men as far as

00:14:21.899 --> 00:14:23.490
the culture is concerned.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:30.490
Now, what is the matter? Sit down. Sit down
here. Come along. Sit down. Sit down. Be a

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
nice boy. Otherwise -- Now, sit. Nice boy,
all right?

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:51.759
And when you want to say something, don’t
show anger, but determination. You see. Just

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:58.759
sit down with them. Then they know what

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:16.530
you mean.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:29.569
So one side of the thing is of establishing
the Sahaj culture among ourselves and being

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:40.360
kind to them. In the family, to create peace.
That’s the job of a woman.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.100
You see how that man was trying to provoke
Me. But I wriggled out of all his provocations,

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.620
bBecause I’m a woman. Any other man would
have slapped him twice I tell you.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:57.530
In My place, any one of them. Krishna must
have used His Sudarshan. And Christ must have

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:04.220
hit him with His cross, you see. They cannot
bear, you see. They don’t have so much bearing

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:10.300
power. And they cannot wriggle out, you see.
But we can. So that is the quality one has

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.320
to learn: how to wriggle out of this.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:21.130
Then the men have the work to go out, earn.
Women also, it doesn’t matter. But you must

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:28.130
share with them, have companionship with them.
Enjoy your companionship. After all, you see,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:36.720
the romance starts actually after marriage,
not before marriage. I was surprised that

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.650
there’s no book which describes the romance
after marriage in English language. I asked

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:46.640
so many people to find out if there’s a
book that describes romance after marriage.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.930
They said, “No book.” But in Indian books,
Indian languages, we don’t have any romance

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.780
much described before the marriage but always
after the marriage.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:01.340
So I didn’t understand what was this thing
was. After marriage, the romance finishes.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.970
Not in Sahaj culture …

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:09.970
Hallo. Now, come along. Ask him to … take
him out … Put him in there in the room.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.910
He’ll be all right. No, you can’t sit
here. Come along. Tell him. Now he’ll be

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:24.910
all right. If you beat, you cannot sit here.
Now you take him. No, you take him out. Take

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:32.040
him out and put him in the room. He will be
all right. Now, why did you beat?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.660
And the men have to know that they have to
respect their women. In the presence of their

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.960
children specially, they must really respect.
If you’re angry you can do what you like

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:10.390
in the bedrooms. In the presence of your children
you should behave yourself. And this is one

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:17.390
of the reasons why the children in the West
are not at all obedient. No sense of respect.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:31.620
So the respect that husband pays to the wife
is absolutely important. For example, now

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:39.290
supposing I’m sitting here and my husband
is sitting here and I want a glass of water.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:46.230
If I try to get up he’ll ask the children,
“Go and get it for your mother.”

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.800
If they say, “All right, daddy, should we
put some oil in your head?”

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.300
“First put in your mother’s head.”

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.640
“Can we go out?”

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.140
“Ask her. What does she say.”

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.760
So put all the authority towards her. This
is the job of men. You see, then only the

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.760
love grows. Moreover, if wife is sick, she
needs your protection. You must go all out

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.080
to be gentle, very gentle with them. If the
husband is gentle with the wife, the children

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:30.080
will be very gentle, too. How you gently hug
your wife. How you talk to her, how you express

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:38.370
yourself to her. It’s all very, very important.
And care for her -- to make her most important.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.970
You see, if she’s sitting uncomfortable,
“Should I make something comfortable for

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:50.860
you?” Then if you are decorating, “Aha,
this year Mommy will like very much, isn’t

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.410
she.” All such things suggest how much the
husband cares for the wife.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:22:00.860
Or sometimes bring some present for her, in
the presence of children you should give,

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:07.530
so that they also have that respect for the
mother. Gentleness is missing, completely.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:13.680
We are very harsh sometimes. We are volcanic.
And I don’t know how people can stand volcanic

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:20.680
women and volcanic men. So to be very gentle
is the best way to live together. And to care

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:28.060
for each other is very important. Then you
start missing each other, don’t dominate

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.940
each other. On the contrary if the wife is
going towards, then the husband would rush,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.250
say, “No, no, no, no, no, let me go.”

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:43.030
Gradually they develop these qualities in
them. Not by fighting, not by quarreling,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:50.020
arguing. Gradually they will develop these
habits. And you’ll be very happy to be in

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.630
love with each other.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:59.630
I am only worried about our family system
in Sahaja Yoga. It’s very important, extremely

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.620
important. If the family is not all right,
how are we going to keep all of you together?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.060
And I want the whole world to be together.
How can we get the whole world together if

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:18.470
you cannot have one family all together? But
in no way it means that you become a slave

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:25.050
to your husband or a slave to your wife as
far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned. Sahaja Yoga

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:30.110
is above everything. If husband tries to do
something against Sahaja Yog, you should stand

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:37.110
against it. If the wife wants to do something
against Sahaja Yoga, you stand up. Nothing

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:44.080
else. Because this is something precious you
have got and you have to live with it, and

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.950
you have to enjoy it.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:55.950
It is very difficult for people to understand
that Sahaj culture is the only culture in

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:03.950
which people can live happily together. There
is no other way out. We start from the very

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.920
primitive to the most modern. We have imbibed
lots of things of the Indian culture as well

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:21.400
as lots of things from the Western culture.
For example, we allow divorce. Not at the

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.490
slightest thing. It’s not a very good thing
to divorce also, but in case everything fails

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:33.510
and everything is so horrid and by law you
feel horrible with your standing, then I say,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:40.510
“All right. You can have this, you can have
the divorce.” So we could have a little

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:47.940
compromise on that point. But we have the
least divorces in Sahaja Yoga. Say in a church

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.040
if there are ten marriages per year ---I don’t
know if they even have so many, but even if

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.910
they had, nobody goes to the church -- out
of them, nine of them are failures, first

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:05.910
year only. Compared to that, we are much better
off. We have some problems, in the beginning

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:12.520
sometimes it happens, but on the whole we
are much better off than all other people.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:19.520
Now it’s for you to decide whether you want
to enjoy your wife or your husband or not.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:28.180
If you have everything and you do not know
how to enjoy, then what to do? So all this

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:35.410
anger, all this temper should go away. You
should introspect also, “ What am I doing?

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:44.250
What am I expecting? What am I doing to the
other party? Why can’t I enjoy?”

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:51.790
Just ask this question: “Why can I not enjoy
my wife or my husband?” Just ask this question

00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:00.040
and you’ll realize the problem is more with
you than the other party.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:12.280
So our family system has to be absolutely
ideal. And we have to prove to the world that

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:19.260
those who are getting married in Sahaja Yoga
are the ideal husband and wife; or those who

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:25.670
are Sahaj yogis, even if they are married
outside but they become Sahaja yogis, they

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:32.670
become ideal husband and wife. The relationship
between them are the best, and for that, whatever

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:44.010
is necessary you should do; whatever has to
be done, you should do. No sacrifice, no adjustment.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.940
It’s just our idea. Just our idea.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:56.940
So this is My last advice to you, that have
beautiful families, pure families and love

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:07.370
all the children as your own children. It
will work out much better. Nobody should object

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:17.500
if some child is corrected. Never. If somebody
corrects your child, you should be thankful

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.580
to that person that they have corrected your
child. And then children are frightened of

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:27.340
the collective because they think all the
collective are together if they are not misbehaving.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:34.220
You see, if you start supporting on your own
child, then the child becomes, you see, quite

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:40.370
clever. It knows that “Nobody can say anything
to me,” but the whole collective -- if just

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:47.370
now the child has gone there, you see, they
all have felt it. Because all of us have decided.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:54.570
They’ll all behave. But if somebody had
supported that child, then the children wouldn’t.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:05.190
So all of us should support all the children,
and if some child is wrong, then we all should

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:09.040
say, “All right, you’re wrong.”
Because all of them are your children. Take

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.250
it like that. They are collective children.
You have to look after them; you have to bother

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:19.960
about them; you have to help them. Everything
has to be done on a collective basis. But

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.330
supposing one child is bad, then all of us,
all of us, should tell that child that “You’re

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:31.400
bad.” Then he improves. Also we have to
tell them, “You are Sahaja yogis, you can’t

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.880
do like that. You are Sahaja yogis; you’re
great. You can’t do like this.” And that

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.300
will work also, very well.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:48.570
Also other relations we have outside who are
not Sahaja yogis, just see if they are nice

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:55.400
people. You need not be rude to them, need
not cut out from them. But if they are rude

00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:02.400
and if they are against Sahaja Yoga, then
it’s better not go near them. Better not.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:19.600
So you should just try to make a point in
your life that you are going to show Mother

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:31.970
that we are very happily married people. And
that’s what it is I want to see among you.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:43.430
Now we are a very big family all over the
world and as you are Ganesha’s patrons here,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:53.240
it’s also important that the family should
be the best in Australia. ‘Cause Ganesha

00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:01.560
is the product of a very beautiful family.
I hope you’ll all understand this. Seriously

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.880
take it up, and work it out and practice it.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:14.880
I’m told that people get angry if somebody
corrects their children. Is very wrong. Never.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:21.100
Feel detached about it. You shouldn’t spoil
your children. And we have had a very bad

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.930
experience with these children when they came
to India. And we thought from which land they

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:29.320
have arrived.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:36.320
My tour has been very successful thanks to
you all. You have worked very hard, I must

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.500
say, very hard. Next time I’m told I’ll
have no radio, television, nothing of the

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:52.500
kind. Just a waste of time with them. We’ll
just have all posters which are very good

00:30:53.670 --> 00:31:00.670
because they emit vibrations by which people
feel much better. We’ll have also beautiful

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:10.460
-- what you call them? Banners. Banners. And
wherever is possible, you can put it. And

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:26.180
it is My name there; when the wind blows also,
the vibrations are emitted. Also you could

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:33.720
go into the newspapers. That’s all right.
But no more of this radio or these things.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:37.030
The other day I asked some people, “Did
you hear the radio?” Nobody has known if

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:42.840
there was a press card. So we are wasting
our time with this radio and television absolutely,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.570
we are not going to have anything to do with
it.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:54.570
All those who are coming to India, they should
try to book as early as possible, and let

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:02.100
Me know when they are coming; they are all
welcome. This time we are changing our plans.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:08.130
We are going via Madras. I want you to see
the south. So we’ll be traveling not by

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:15.130
those horrible buses, but by the train, by
the train this time. Up to Ganapatipule we

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:23.520
cannot go by train as you know, but up to
Kolapur. And from Kolapur to Ganapatipule

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.670
is not such a long distance. The road is quite
nice.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:35.670
This time we are going to very different places
like Madras, Bhairov, Hyderabad, then Puna,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:43.960
and then to Ganapatipule. I hope you’ll
all enjoy your stay this time again in India.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:53.110
And lots of people will be coming again. We
are really having a great success everywhere.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:59.720
I’m sure this time we’ll have many more
people.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.310
If you have money problem, you can write to
Me also. We can make some arrangements for

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:10.310
that. But, you see, we cannot reduce now any
more. We have kept the same price throughout

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:15.760
because we have to pay for the Russians, for
all these Eastern Bloc people, their food,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.910
their living. We have to lend them money.
There are absolutely, say, about a hundred

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:26.020
people coming without a single pai on them.
They’re traveling; so, sorry, but we have

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:32.710
to compensate for it. I know it pressurizes
everyone. But we have to compensate.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.600
And other nations are at least paying for
their travels.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:43.410
I can’t pay for their travel. That’s a
hundred people traveling. So, as far as Australia

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:48.290
is concerned, you don’t have to share that
part.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:55.290
So, may God bless you!

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:05.140
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mother. We would like to
give You a little memento of Your tour. It

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:19.480
is something that has been with You for some
time. Each time you had a public program or

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:26.480
even at the puja it was there. It was made
by Sahaj yogis, a whole series of them, even

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:32.319
some children participated in it, into this
screen.

00:34:32.319 --> 00:34:39.319
Shri Mataji: Oh, My! Thank you so much. It’s
so beautiful. You know, today only I was just

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.520
thinking what a nice thing it is. I shouldn’t
desire anything, I think.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:03.040
Now, very beautiful. Very, very beautiful.
It gives so many ideas of colors and things.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:18.650
You have so much of talent here I must say.
But you’ll have to bring it with you.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:25.010
Sahaja yogi: We could dismantle it, You know
that? and just bring You the silk screen.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.280
Shri Mataji: Thank you, Alex.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:35.280
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mother, from all your children
in Australia, we thank you in our hearts for

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.290
coming and giving us such a wonderful tour.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:45.580
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Ki Jay!

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:52.580
Shri Mataji: And any disease or anything you
have, any problem, you have to tell Steven,

00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:01.160
or you can tell Me, or inform Dr. Spiro, or
someone, whomsoever you want to. Any disease.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:07.700
Don’t be shy about it. And I’ll tell you
how to treat it. I mean, normally it is only

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:12.890
on the vibrations you have to say left, right,
what is the problem is, but there are certain

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.710
things which require more attention …
