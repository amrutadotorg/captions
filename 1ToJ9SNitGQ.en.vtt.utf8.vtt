00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.709
Mother, there was such a big heart catch

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.500
these twenty-four hours.

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:37.917
Open your hearts is the point.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:39.792
Why don't you open your hearts?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.792
Open your hearts.

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.542
For frivolous thing, nonsensical thing we open our hearts,

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:54.667
why not for God? Open it!

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:01.375
You are made lotuses, but open the lotus.

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.000
The day should come when we should have Shiva's Puja

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.125
in England,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.166
let that such a day come!

00:02:24.417 --> 00:02:27.709
But to do Shiva's Puja is not a easy thing, you know.

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:33.959
You have already reached one stage - Vishnumaya.

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.333
Open it out.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.458
Unless and until you open your heart,

00:02:49.792 --> 00:02:51.500
your Brahmarandra cannot be open,

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:54.000
your Sahasrara cannot be open.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.500
What are you worried about - lunch?

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:07.125
I can stop all their watches, if you want!

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:11.959
All right. Now, come along, let's have it.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:13.999
Better now.

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:20.792
Now go ahead, have your lunch.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.709
After lunch, I am going to be here?

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:30.625
Yes, I am staying here.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.999
You will all go, I will be here.

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:44.917
I told you, I have just stopped their watches!

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:56.999
If you want you can give Me presents

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.667
and then there's time for lunch.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:29.834
What's that?

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:35.166
Shri Mataji, this is a present from Austria,

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:39.500
to express our - we want to thank You for allowing us

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.999
to be here, and this is a vase, handmade.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.333
So beautiful!

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:46.750
which should fit

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.999
for the figures you got in Brighton, from Austria.

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:54.291
Such a beauty!

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:00.625
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.208
Already you have brought such nice music from Austria,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.291
what more do you want to bring?

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.917
What's that?

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:13.333
A present from France, Mother.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:13.999
For what?

00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:15.667
with all our love.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:18.208
For Your blessings.

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:18.834
All right.

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:25.917
Now you'd better open it for Me.

00:07:32.875 --> 00:07:33.875
Shri Mataji,

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:37.500
we've made a magazine in Italian language

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.875
to let the people know on the

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:42.917
circulations of Your speeches,

00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:44.875
and we would like You to bless it.

00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:46.750
May God bless you.

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:50.166
Oh, very beautiful vibrations!

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.166
Tremendous vibration.

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:55.083
Because they are Your talks in there.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500
You have translated?

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:00.041
Such vibration. You have?

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:02.917
Oh, wow, such vibrations in this book!

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.625
This is the first book of its kind,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.583
first book of My lectures is this one

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.375
- apart from our "Nirmala Yoga"

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:14.959
- first book.

00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:17.709
Yes, in Italian language.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.208
It's called that, "The White Horse."

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:31.500
And we want to give one copy for each country,

00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.542
to let them see, if there is the somebody speaking Italian,

00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.959
we've got here.

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:46.709
And we would like to bring this rakshabandhan from Italy.

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:53.709
All right. What's that?

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:57.458
This is some leaves from our garden.

00:09:00.709 --> 00:09:02.166
This is olive tree.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.458
Oh, good, beautiful! What an idea,

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:08.875
to give a branch of olive.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.583
May God bless you.

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:14.834
And they are from my wife, Shri Mataji.

00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:16.792
From your wife.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.959
Oh, too much!

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:26.417
They're made out of Gian.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:29.709
Gian is the town where it's made.

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:32.625
Gian. The name of a town,

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:33.959
where pottery are made.

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:35.667
How do you spell "Gian"?

00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:38.083
Gian. G-i-a-n.

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:40.208
Gian.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.125
Really?

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:44.083
Even now they make it?

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:46.375
But this is contemporary.

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:52.125
Beautiful!

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:55.417
Otherwise the French art is going down.

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:58.792
Very surprising!

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:04.458
And what a beauty, what a beauty, just see this now.

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:22.583
This is a flower that is liked by Shri Ganesha.

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:40.667
You've done it?

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:45.999
Beautiful,

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:55.458
Beautiful.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.542
Very well done, thank you very much, thank you.

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:04.750
Beautiful.

00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:08.166
Such artists we have, I didn't know.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.417
Tremendous!

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:12.500
Thank you very much.

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:17.041
Look at that one.

00:11:33.041 --> 00:11:36.834
Oh, I am already eating the French cheese,

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:38.959
and it's such a big one you have given Me

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.500
that it will last for the whole year!

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:46.333
Thank you, thank you.

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.875
Can you keep it there?

00:11:51.375 --> 00:11:52.041
What's that?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.291
This is from Holland.

00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:54.875
What is it?

00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:56.834
What is it? Again cheese. Thank you.

00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.208
But you always give Me presents.

00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:10.083
From all of you?

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:13.458
Ah, what a beauty, eh?

00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.709
You have an eye for beauty, I must say, real beauty.

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:21.208
It's beautiful, thank you.

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:24.667
Gregoire's wife has given Me a nice one like this,

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:28.542
I'll keep it with that. Thank you.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.834
Prices are increasing!

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.834
Vishnumaya.

00:12:56.792 --> 00:13:01.000
Hah, that's Vishnumaya, rainbow is Her sign,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.333
that after rainbow there won't be any

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:06.792
- that's the sign that there won't be any more of lightning.

00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:08.458
If you see the rainbow,

00:13:08.458 --> 00:13:12.792
there won't be any lightning after that, that is assurance.

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:17.959
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

00:13:17.959 --> 00:13:19.999
I don't know what to say.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.125
Thank you very much. Beautiful.

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:24.166
May God bless you.

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:33.000
Just bring it this side. Turn it round.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.959
Take out the sari.

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:37.917
Take out the sari.

00:13:48.875 --> 00:13:50.417
Very small, Mother,

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:52.417
Shri Ganesha has found it for me.

00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.208
Oh, really?

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:56.917
Shri Ganesha cannot be small.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.542
He is very subtle,

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:04.250
He is in every atom and He is everywhere, all right?

00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:05.667
Thank you very much.

00:14:06.208 --> 00:14:07.333
May God bless you.

00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:09.417
You are doing very well, I must say,

00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:11.792
in Sahaja Yoga, I am very happy.

00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:22.917
What's that?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:37.417
It's so beautiful, I tell you,

00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:39.083
but there's no need to open it.

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:41.542
It's so beautiful.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.750
Beautiful. Just let them have a look.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.625
You have done it?

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.041
So beautiful.

00:15:11.083 --> 00:15:12.792
It's not Shri Ganesha.

00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:18.500
That's an ornament of Shri Ganesh.

00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:22.500
It's too expensive a present to be given

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:28.375
- coral and pearls

00:15:28.917 --> 00:15:31.375
- that's too much!

00:15:32.959 --> 00:15:36.917
All right, I'll cherish it.

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:39.500
Thank you.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.792
With these pujas I am making lot of things, isn't it;

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:48.625
because when you give Me money I can buy something,

00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:50.250
still it can work on you,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.792
but what to do with these - becomes

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.333
permanent part and parcel of Me.

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:00.834
Thank you.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.333
What's that,

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:07.375
something small again from Brighton?

00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:25.583
Hester, really it's great.

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:32.792
Oh, it's too much, too much, too much.

00:16:37.792 --> 00:16:41.333
Ah, how symbolic it is, how symbolic.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.959
Again say it loudly, to them.

00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:46.542
I say, Shri Mataji,

00:16:46.792 --> 00:16:50.792
this is for the Mother of all the brothers and sisters,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.208
the children of the Blossom Times.

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:56.250
And Mother, may we be Your flowers.

00:16:56.709 --> 00:16:58.083
Ah, it's too good.

00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:04.083
Thank you very much.

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:06.625
It is beautiful, too beautiful.

00:17:10.834 --> 00:17:12.125
Mother, with Your grace,

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:14.709
in honor of You I opened my shop

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:16.166
and I called it "Mother's Love."

00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:19.583
And yesterday was the grandest opening of my life.

00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:22.750
The shop is absolutely beautiful.

00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:24.083
Where?

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:25.875
In Seaford, near Brighton.

00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:27.333
Oh, I see.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.458
And there is the logo,

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:33.458
and that hopefully will go over the world.

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.625
All my things have been designed with Your name on.

00:17:35.917 --> 00:17:37.917
Ah, that's a good idea.

00:17:37.917 --> 00:17:41.333
"In caring for you and your babies" - great!

00:17:41.667 --> 00:17:43.875
I always have this in My mind

00:17:43.875 --> 00:17:45.750
that we should have a proper shop,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.417
because it's difficult to get cotton clothes here,

00:17:49.417 --> 00:17:50.375
isn't it?

00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:51.750
I've got a girl who is making things for me,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.250
but I'd like to also have things made up.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.625
I will try to tell that you come from India

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.959
May God bless you.

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:12.834
May God bless you.

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:13.709
May God bless you.

00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:15.500
That's a very good thing you are doing,

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.417
may God bless you for that,

00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:20.625
as there's not much care for children here, I see;

00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:23.375
they require lot of attention.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.625
What's this, again?

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.375
All right.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.125
What's that?

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:47.583
From Lausanne?

00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:50.500
So beautiful, done so well.

00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:52.834
Thank you.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.166
I was not prepared,

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:10.458
but I bring You something

00:20:10.458 --> 00:20:11.917
that came from the country I was born in.

00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:12.917
From where?

00:20:12.917 --> 00:20:14.000
From Africa.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.500
It is a magnetized stone,

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:19.583
and it captures the negative vibrations.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.959
I can see it.

00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:26.041
And it was on my neck,

00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:28.000
so I hope it isn't too much negativity with it.

00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:29.875
Oh, I'll manage.

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:32.709
May God bless you.

00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:40.500
What's that?

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.125
Shri Mataji, this is a collective effort from the

00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:43.917
Sahaja yogis of Munich.

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:46.834
Actually it's more a present for us than for You.

00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:50.333
Could You give this Your blessings, please?

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.125
What's that?

00:21:16.583 --> 00:21:18.083
It's a very good photograph, I think,

00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:19.917
very good photograph.

00:21:20.999 --> 00:21:23.999
For outsiders, it's very good photograph.

00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:27.250
May God bless you.

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.583
Very motherly.

00:21:32.709 --> 00:21:34.999
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:48.959
Done?

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:51.125
We are in time?

00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:05.125
Something's still there.

00:22:10.709 --> 00:22:14.834
(Group of yogis from Belgium and Holland are coming forward)

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:18.709
All right.

00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:24.208
I know some of them already.

00:22:24.709 --> 00:22:28.166
All right, let's have it.

00:22:28.625 --> 00:22:30.041
I'm so happy all of you could come,

00:22:30.333 --> 00:22:32.125
that's the main point is.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.959
That's the biggest thing, that you all could come today,

00:22:35.166 --> 00:22:36.792
at such a great puja.

00:22:37.166 --> 00:22:39.709
And according to Warren,

00:22:39.959 --> 00:22:44.834
Brussels and the Holland people have a great humility.

00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:47.917
They are very humble people for spirituality,

00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:50.000
and the media is also very good.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.625
So I think today's puja was actually

00:22:52.625 --> 00:22:55.166
because of you people it was performed.

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:57.750
He says they're very humble people,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
the media is very humble,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:03.250
and there's a kind of humility that really works there.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.834
So now, what is it?

00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:11.041
Come along, come along. Dominique, how are you?

00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:14.041
What is the file you are carrying?

00:23:14.709 --> 00:23:16.959
What is the file?

00:23:34.083 --> 00:23:38.375
Who wrote the article, the newspaper people?

00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:41.208
They liked it?

00:23:42.458 --> 00:23:43.834
Good, good. That's why they were saying

00:23:43.834 --> 00:23:45.625
the media is very helpful,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
that's it.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.333
What is it?

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:07.625
The translation's from the Flemish,

00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:10.792
but not from French, Mother.

00:24:12.834 --> 00:24:14.125
It's a nice article.

00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:17.834
Very good, very factual reporting, no distortions.

00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:21.750
Good. So that's it.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.500
Shri Mataji,

00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:25.792
two years ago we have made a photocopy

00:24:25.792 --> 00:24:27.750
of Your Lotus Feet in France,

00:24:34.917 --> 00:24:36.917
and we're are putting this poster in the shop

00:24:36.917 --> 00:24:38.250
for copying, You know.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.625
And they are sending,

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:42.208
they offered this picture of Your Lotus Feet everywhere,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.917
just to show what they can do with the photocopy, and so...

00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:52.834
Mother, You know the copy of the Feet

00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:54.166
which the French brought to India,

00:24:54.417 --> 00:24:57.417
and distributed far and wide - that was the photocopy.

00:24:57.875 --> 00:24:59.083
And that same photocopy

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:01.083
now they are using as it as an example

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:02.625
of the promotional material.

00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:07.667
The ones with the Feet one on top of another, a little bit?

00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:08.999
No, No, Mother.

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:14.417
Which one? Which one? Which Feet?

00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:16.291
That's the one with the white carpet,

00:25:16.542 --> 00:25:18.250
and you can see.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.875
Everything, all the puja?

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:21.250
With sparkling gold on Your Feet.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.166
Oh, I see, really?

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.500
Where did you see that?

00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:49.999
In Brussels.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.875
Really?

00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:54.583
So these are doing in Brussels?

00:25:54.999 --> 00:25:56.834
Yes and I think everywhere,

00:25:56.834 --> 00:26:00.125
all over the world for this company,

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:02.709
called - this French company

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:04.458
called "Happy Door Color."

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:07.375
And they're sending from France all over?

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.792
I think so, yes.

00:26:08.792 --> 00:26:11.458
You see they give an example of their work,

00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:13.458
and Your Feet are the example.

00:26:15.458 --> 00:26:16.834
Is it?

00:26:20.792 --> 00:26:22.583
Such a joke, eh?

00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:27.417
Because of My Feet it must have come out well, you see,

00:26:27.417 --> 00:26:29.709
so they are using the idea of advertising.

00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:33.000
We don't spend there, but we get the advantage!

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.417
That's good, My Feet going all over is the best thing!

00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:45.709
That's great, really.

00:26:46.375 --> 00:26:47.999
There's one outstanding thing, Mother,

00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:49.999
about the Belgian and the Holland people,

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:52.709
we're getting people now from the professional levels.

00:26:53.834 --> 00:26:56.375
It's really an interesting trend in Sahaja Yoga;

00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:57.709
we're not just getting the hippies

00:26:57.959 --> 00:27:00.500
and the counter-culture people.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.083
It's a big change.

00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:04.667
No, we had some,

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:07.333
but I think they were all very nice, those hippies.

00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:10.291
They're nice people, they're so nice, really.

00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:13.166
It's such a blessing to be there;

00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.542
I really, I was very, very happy,

00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:16.333
because it worked out very well.

00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:17.917
Now you have to introduce, all right?

00:27:17.917 --> 00:27:19.999
Let's start, one by one.

00:27:20.917 --> 00:27:23.333
This is Henry from Brussels.

00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:26.542
Just behind is Jeanine.

00:27:26.875 --> 00:27:28.792
She is from Holland, actually,

00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.250
but she is living in Brussels.

00:27:30.792 --> 00:27:32.917
Just four weeks after meeting You,

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:35.208
she explained to new people,

00:27:35.709 --> 00:27:37.709
she explained everything about Sahaja Yoga;

00:27:37.999 --> 00:27:40.208
it was such a nice program.

00:27:40.458 --> 00:27:43.792
And she also translates into French.

00:27:45.667 --> 00:27:47.000
She's very good.

00:27:47.333 --> 00:27:48.375
Where were you all lost?

00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:49.792
I don't know, suddenly

00:27:49.792 --> 00:27:52.792
I find all My children coming back to Me!

00:27:53.375 --> 00:27:54.792
All right.

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:07.000
He is yoga teacher,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.917
and he wants to slowly come around to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:10.917 --> 00:28:12.125
Yoga is to be used,

00:28:12.125 --> 00:28:13.375
but in a particular way.

00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:15.583
When the Kundalini rises you have to know

00:28:15.583 --> 00:28:19.125
what chakras are catching, and what you have to correct.

00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.667
Now, unless and until you know what's wrong with you,

00:28:22.083 --> 00:28:25.792
then you would not know what to correct.

00:28:25.792 --> 00:28:28.250
In the same way, you should know what's wrong with others.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.125
So when you know, then you know

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:33.375
what chakra is to be corrected,

00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:36.417
how to correct it, what mantras are to be used.

00:28:36.709 --> 00:28:37.959
All it's a big science,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.959
and that's how it has to be understood,

00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:43.500
because without the Kundalini

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.999
it's not connected science, it's just haphazard.

00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:02.125
This is Herman from Antwerp.

00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:08.041
Oh, I see. Antwerp I have been before also.

00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:11.208
There are some people whom all of us met them,

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:13.333
but it's very difficult to reach them.

00:29:13.917 --> 00:29:18.208
They are telephoning to have the book, Gregoire's book.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.999
This Gregoire's book?

00:29:21.959 --> 00:29:24.250
You read his book, and that's how you came?

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.834
Yes.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.834
There are some people in Belgium everywhere,

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:31.834
but they can't come in the Brussels.

00:29:32.083 --> 00:29:34.125
Oh, great!

00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:44.500
Good. You wanted to expand.

00:29:44.834 --> 00:29:46.417
How is Natalie?

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.959
she is coming to India Tour.

00:29:49.959 --> 00:29:51.583
Good. That's good, that's good.

00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:53.834
India Tour they should make, I think.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.000
How many?

00:29:56.333 --> 00:29:59.583
Really? Make it fourteen, thirteen's not a good number!

00:29:59.583 --> 00:30:01.917
Try to make it fourteen.

00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:05.083
Only from Belgium?

00:30:05.792 --> 00:30:08.333
Shri Mataji, I told them that as a little exception

00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:10.999
they can register a little late, because...

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.875
Yes, they can. You just - you see,

00:30:12.875 --> 00:30:14.667
now I am going to be here for some time, they can.

00:30:14.917 --> 00:30:16.458
But you see, it's a chance, big chance.

00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:18.208
I don't know next year,

00:30:18.208 --> 00:30:20.792
I don't know what will be the situation,

00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:22.792
because this will be very interesting and good,

00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.542
the way we have travelled and all that.

00:30:25.917 --> 00:30:28.458
I mean, you can't make it anything better than that,

00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.166
the program is only for three weeks.

00:30:30.458 --> 00:30:31.750
You see, it's three weeks' program,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.625
you cannot make it smaller than that, isn't it?

00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:37.625
Here is Heidi.

00:30:37.917 --> 00:30:39.792
She's great, I tell you.

00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:43.999
And her mother from South Africa, also.

00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:45.917
You have a great child.

00:30:45.917 --> 00:30:48.333
Hello! What is your name?

00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:52.999
Marilise.

00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:09.417
Shri Mataji, her father was in the Himalayas for some time,

00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:12.542
beating his head on the rocks.

00:31:12.792 --> 00:31:14.792
Himalaya is here!

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:18.041
But now he has come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:20.667
But they are seekers, you see.

00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:24.041
He got quite badly damaged by the lamas,

00:31:24.458 --> 00:31:26.667
and he's just suffering a bit at the moment from that.

00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:29.083
Terrible people these lamas are.

00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:35.750
They are hoping to come to India...

00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:37.834
Let's see.

00:31:38.166 --> 00:31:39.834
Take it easy. There's no hurry,

00:31:39.834 --> 00:31:42.125
but I think if you can manage will be good idea;

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.709
because once, he once settles down very well

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:47.125
with Sahaja Yoga, once you go to India.

00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:50.041
And because India, it's a very different country,

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:51.834
where we move about

00:31:52.125 --> 00:31:55.500
- you won't find that with the lamas or anyone.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.583
Here is Nina.

00:31:59.583 --> 00:32:01.917
Actually she is Jewish,

00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:05.250
half-Jewish.

00:32:06.917 --> 00:32:09.709
She is from Brussels, but she's French.

00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:13.750
She speaks French.

00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:17.250
Yes, she is looking younger and younger, I think.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.917
Isn't she? She's changed a lot.

00:32:20.917 --> 00:32:22.458
All her wrinkles gone

00:32:22.792 --> 00:32:24.333
- she looks much younger now.

00:32:25.083 --> 00:32:27.000
You'll introduce all of them?

00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:35.542
This is Claudine, Daniel's mother.

00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:38.917
She is going to the Canary Islands,

00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:40.083
and she wants to know more about.

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:42.667
You! You are going to Canary Islands?

00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:46.875
And take Sahaja Yoga there.

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:52.709
This Canary Island...

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.709
Good place.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.500
Now.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.625
Nina would like to give You something.

00:33:01.709 --> 00:33:04.375
Yes, you gave Me - why did you give Me?

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.125
I would like to keep with Me, all right?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
I'll look after them.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.458
Are they seekers?

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.583
They'll come round, then don't you worry.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.625
This is Rene and Anya, from Brussels.

00:33:40.959 --> 00:33:43.583
He is a doctor and osteopath.

00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:45.417
Osteopath?

00:33:45.417 --> 00:33:46.000
He trained in England,

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:47.583
Really?

00:33:47.583 --> 00:33:50.583
and he has now been very actively involved

00:33:50.834 --> 00:33:52.125
in Sahaja Yoga in Brussels

00:33:52.375 --> 00:33:54.959
Yes. Yes.

00:34:01.792 --> 00:34:03.999
It's attacking from every side:

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.291
muscular problems, bone problems,

00:34:10.291 --> 00:34:14.000
so many problems there are of these negative forces,

00:34:14.417 --> 00:34:17.083
and which are beyond the reach of medical science.

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:20.083
See, because if it is the Mooladhara,

00:34:20.417 --> 00:34:21.458
they don't understand,

00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:23.999
they don't understand the innocence part.

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:28.000
So many diseases come from Mooladhara, so many,

00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:31.458
and they have no way out for it.

00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:34.625
But to take to something like that,

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:38.625
it's difficult for them to get out of that knowledge.

00:34:38.999 --> 00:34:41.208
Because this is the Knowledge of the Knowledge,

00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:43.417
to get to the essence of it,

00:34:43.417 --> 00:34:45.375
you see - and then the whole thing changes,

00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:47.208
it's very different.

00:34:49.083 --> 00:34:50.625
It works out.

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:53.291
We need osteopaths,

00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:55.166
really everybody's Vishuddhi is so bad

00:34:55.166 --> 00:34:58.875
that only poor Warren has been correcting

00:34:58.875 --> 00:34:59.999
everybody's Vishuddhi.

00:35:00.208 --> 00:35:03.166
And now you can do it also!

00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:11.417
This is, behind, Marie-Louise and Jack,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.417
What is the name?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:15.959
from Brussels.

00:35:15.959 --> 00:35:17.458
I can't understand your pronunciation.

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:21.291
Marie-Louise, thank you.

00:35:21.542 --> 00:35:24.208
Only they say "h" for "r", is it?

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.625
For "Marie" they said "Mahi"?

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:35.959
Ah. Good, because you see,

00:35:36.208 --> 00:35:41.667
"Marie" is "Mary", becomes "meha";

00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:48.583
"meha" means the rain, in Sanskrit.

00:35:53.208 --> 00:35:54.125
All right?

00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:01.542
So how are you, you are looking much younger too.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.959
How are you feeling?

00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:16.333
Imagine,

00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:19.000
before going to any other Western countries

00:36:19.375 --> 00:36:22.959
I went first to Belgium and to Holland,

00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:25.834
in '65.

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:28.875
You remember in Holland they celebrated the hundred years

00:36:29.083 --> 00:36:31.792
or something of the gardening or something they had,

00:36:31.792 --> 00:36:33.917
in '65, do you know that?

00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:36.333
They had a huge exhibition,

00:36:36.333 --> 00:36:38.542
that's the thing I saw.

00:36:39.375 --> 00:36:41.333
Then I went to Hamburg, and in Hamburg there was

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:43.041
a hundred years of the Hamburg boats.

00:36:43.041 --> 00:36:47.250
So they had a huge, big - what you call them,

00:36:52.959 --> 00:36:54.375
a celebration

00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:57.375
with crackers and a lot of these fireworks

00:36:57.375 --> 00:37:02.500
all kinds of things, which was a tremendous idea.

00:37:02.917 --> 00:37:04.959
And we all were on a river, on a boat,

00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:06.625
and from there we could see these.

00:37:06.625 --> 00:37:08.041
I've never seen such fireworks:

00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:12.125
things used to break into trees, into flowers, into fruits,

00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:14.250
everything - the fire, you know

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.959
- they had made it such special ones.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.583
So that happened in Hamburg,

00:37:17.834 --> 00:37:20.166
and in Holland I was there for this great exhibition,

00:37:20.166 --> 00:37:22.375
miles together, too.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:25.917
They had fountains and they had little lakes,

00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:30.125
and they had little brooks running around and bridges,

00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:33.625
beautiful, and all tulips and everything, beautiful

00:37:34.041 --> 00:37:36.041
they were - all kinds of flowers.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.291
The best sight one could think of,

00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:41.125
the flowers and the garden.

00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:44.041
Now...

00:37:59.291 --> 00:38:01.166
May God bless you.

00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:06.667
This is Chandra.

00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:08.500
She has a remarkable story, Mother.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.959
She was born of traditional Indian parents in Holland,

00:38:12.166 --> 00:38:15.291
for every intent and purpose of Dutch blood,

00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:17.458
Really?

00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:22.083
and she's found the reality of Hinduism in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:22.834 --> 00:38:23.999
It's very beautiful.

00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:26.166
It's true. No doubt.

00:38:26.834 --> 00:38:29.291
You see, as every religion is gone

00:38:29.667 --> 00:38:32.500
into some sort of a pickling,

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:35.458
it's only through Sahaja Yoga you'll understand

00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:36.750
they were all true, all true.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.500
Every one of them was true, correct,

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.000
integrated absolutely one with each other.

00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:45.458
But for that you have to become the spirit,

00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:46.959
otherwise you cannot understand.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.999
But there's only one thing very good about

00:38:49.208 --> 00:38:50.417
the Indian philosophy is that,

00:38:50.417 --> 00:38:52.208
that throughout they have talked of nothing else but

00:38:52.208 --> 00:38:56.500
spiritual emancipation, and becoming one with the spirit

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:58.999
- nothing else. First is first.

00:39:00.083 --> 00:39:01.875
And also about deities they talked.

00:39:01.875 --> 00:39:03.542
But Buddha did not talk even that.

00:39:03.542 --> 00:39:06.083
He said, "Don't talk of deities, don't talk of God,

00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:08.667
don't talk of anyone; just talk of the spirit."

00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:10.750
He was so particular that

00:39:10.999 --> 00:39:13.834
people should put their attention only to their spirit,

00:39:13.834 --> 00:39:15.041
to begin with, then we'll know.

00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:17.166
Mahavira did the same - both of them.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.041
So you see, in the philosophy it's not,

00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:22.166
sort of, one something;

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:26.583
but main idea of the whole Indian philosophy is

00:39:26.875 --> 00:39:29.041
- whether Hindu, Buddhist or Jainist,

00:39:29.041 --> 00:39:31.500
or any one of these which were in India

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.750
- is that first thing is to get your Self-realization.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.625
And all your life should be built-in on that thing.

00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:40.875
For example, it is said your chitta should be controlled.

00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:42.875
You should not allow your attention to go

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:44.458
and get involved into everything.

00:39:44.709 --> 00:39:47.125
So all these ideas, romantic ideas, this is wrong.

00:39:48.291 --> 00:39:49.709
Keep your attention to yourself.

00:39:49.709 --> 00:39:51.291
You cannot put your attention

00:39:51.291 --> 00:39:54.291
to anything where it is wasted - chitta nirodha.

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:57.125
And when that started, you see,

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.250
then only people can see that

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.166
when you keep your attention to yourself,

00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:06.583
then your attention rises higher, it's not frittering away.

00:40:06.834 --> 00:40:09.417
So the essence of all the religions is the same,

00:40:09.709 --> 00:40:11.417
it's the Self-realization,

00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:13.500
first and foremost thing;

00:40:13.834 --> 00:40:16.500
and without that it is what you call "without the life"

00:40:16.959 --> 00:40:20.834
- we have "with dead bodies" - nishpran.

00:40:21.125 --> 00:40:24.458
Without life if you follow a religion, it has no meaning,

00:40:24.709 --> 00:40:25.750
it's all without life.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.625
Nothing wrong with the religion as such,

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:31.125
but it is without life, they have taken out the life now.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.875
Without life it becomes damaged.

00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:36.041
Life is Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:36.375 --> 00:40:37.959
Yoga is the...

00:40:37.959 --> 00:40:40.709
May God bless you.

00:40:41.583 --> 00:40:44.041
This is Karina, from The Hague.

00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:46.375
Karima?

00:40:46.375 --> 00:40:47.709
Oh, we have one Karim there in Holland.

00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:48.959
We must locate him.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.000
Do you have the address of Karim?

00:40:51.458 --> 00:40:54.166
He's a young boy, realized soul, a great person, I must say.

00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:57.583
He used to come here and now his father is in Holland,

00:40:57.917 --> 00:40:59.709
who drinks a lot.

00:41:03.583 --> 00:41:05.583
He said - I asked him, "How is your father?"

00:41:05.583 --> 00:41:06.999
"He's like all other Dutch."

00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:08.250
I said, "What do you mean?"

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.250
"They all drink a lot."

00:41:10.583 --> 00:41:14.583
I said, "No, no, everybody drinks, not only the Dutch."

00:41:15.166 --> 00:41:19.417
His mother is French and father is Dutch,

00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:22.625
and they were divorced, so he took away the boy.

00:41:22.999 --> 00:41:25.999
He comes here sometimes - he's a great soul, Karim.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:30.583
How it is you found this name "Karima"?

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.041
How did they give you this name Karima?

00:41:36.417 --> 00:41:39.375
No, my name is Karina.

00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:47.583
Oh, I see, it's evolved into that.

00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:54.625
"Karima" means "Karim," means "the one who is the creator."

00:41:54.959 --> 00:41:57.417
"Karima" is the power of the creator.

00:42:01.625 --> 00:42:04.166
From there the word "charisma", "charismatic",

00:42:04.166 --> 00:42:07.125
"karishma" comes from there.

00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:11.375
This is Henno, from Amsterdam.

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:18.500
Amsterdam - good.

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:24.166
And this is Herman, from The Hague.

00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:28.291
Henno's looking to move into the ashram

00:42:28.291 --> 00:42:29.999
with the others.

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:33.917
Good. And there's someone there behind.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.083
They already mentioned me, Mother.

00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:41.208
Did they? What's your name?

00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:44.000
Jack, from Brussels.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.208
Oh, I see, Jack is from Brussels.

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.583
Yes, yes, yes, I know. I know Jack.

00:42:58.917 --> 00:43:00.792
It's great, isn't it?

00:43:01.375 --> 00:43:02.083
So,

00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:05.834
you also explain to them that

00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:08.333
Indian Tours are very spartan, you see,

00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:10.917
as far as the personal comforts are concerned,

00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:12.917
and mostly this time it is going to be outside.

00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:16.375
Outside in the open we'll have pendals and things like that,

00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:20.250
which would be like a scouting camp.

00:43:22.125 --> 00:43:24.333
But I think you'll enjoy it because of the nature

00:43:24.583 --> 00:43:27.792
and the beauty and the rivers, and everything will be nice

00:43:27.792 --> 00:43:28.667
- I hope so.

00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:31.959
But main thing is that in that country

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:34.500
you ascend very fast - I have seen it, you see.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.625
It's like nourishes you, it nourishes your being,

00:43:37.625 --> 00:43:42.083
it's a fertile land for spiritual ascent,

00:43:42.625 --> 00:43:45.834
and many have gained a lot,

00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:48.166
so I think it will be a good idea.

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:49.999
Take it easy, there's no hurry.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.291
I am here till the end of this month, definitely;

00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:55.542
maybe a little later I might go.

00:43:55.834 --> 00:43:57.625
So take it easy. Whatever is possible,

00:43:57.875 --> 00:44:01.291
as many as can come I would like to accommodate this time.

00:44:01.667 --> 00:44:03.875
All right? May God bless you.

00:44:09.542 --> 00:44:12.417
Gradually you settle down into your group,

00:44:12.417 --> 00:44:16.583
of such a kind that the same pattern as this people are,

00:44:16.875 --> 00:44:20.083
and then we can have a,

00:44:20.709 --> 00:44:25.333
what you call a regular sort of thing

00:44:25.333 --> 00:44:28.125
as these people have a trust and things like that,

00:44:28.125 --> 00:44:30.458
so that it can be settled into a proper way.

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:34.125
Of course, I never see to the trust accounts,

00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:36.250
and I don't know what it is doing.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.792
But you have to make some people in charge,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.792
and collect some money for your programs when I come there.

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.542
You might need some money for your halls

00:44:48.542 --> 00:44:51.208
and things like that, for advertising.

00:44:51.875 --> 00:44:55.583
Whatever it is, you make a proper trust like that

00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:57.583
and try to make it up now,

00:44:57.875 --> 00:44:59.709
then we may legalize it also.

00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:02.792
But for the time being you must have some people

00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:06.792
who are in charge, and collect some money for programs.

00:45:06.792 --> 00:45:08.999
Because I don't need any money, anything,

00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:11.542
but of course you will need money,

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:14.792
and because next year I am definitely going to come there

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.250
and I'll be there for some time - I hope so.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:21.792
So you need some money by then.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:33.917
Last of all,

00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:38.333
I would like you all to thank Dr. Warren

00:45:38.583 --> 00:45:41.000
for going there on his own,

00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:42.875
working it out so well

00:45:43.166 --> 00:45:44.999
and helping all of them.

00:45:45.208 --> 00:45:47.750
Now, as Bogdan is going to Geneva,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.875
he'll be looking after the whole of Europe,

00:45:51.291 --> 00:45:55.083
and he'll be running from one country to another country

00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:57.333
- Bogdan, Dr. Bogdan.

00:45:57.625 --> 00:46:00.542
And he will be doing all the needful.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.625
Gregoire, of course, is there behind the scenes,

00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:08.792
who has done all this;

00:46:09.041 --> 00:46:12.291
so he is going to guide Bogdan and everyone there,

00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:15.542
and everything is going to be...

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.625
Just come here, I can't hear you. Just come here.

00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:31.250
I wanted to know that if You could come back...

00:46:54.959 --> 00:46:56.000
But if you meditate,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.792
if you put left hand towards photograph,

00:46:57.792 --> 00:47:01.458
right hand like that, and it should work out.

00:47:03.917 --> 00:47:06.375
No, no, no, no - that you should not do.

00:47:09.417 --> 00:47:11.959
So Warren will discuss.

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:23.625
Yes, so Patricia is there, and Antonio can help her.

00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:25.500
All right? Good.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.750
I am very happy you are there.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.917
Now, better - she is there,

00:47:28.917 --> 00:47:31.792
and try to help her in every way she wants;

00:47:31.792 --> 00:47:34.166
because she is doing it well now,

00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:36.792
she is understanding everything well.

00:47:38.959 --> 00:47:41.041
Anything else?

00:47:41.709 --> 00:47:43.166
You are looking so beautiful, all of you.

00:47:43.166 --> 00:47:47.041
And Jack, you are in Belgium, isn't it?

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:53.375
That's good.

00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.667
Yes, I have to go home now.

00:47:56.917 --> 00:47:59.999
I think we have done a very successful seminar,

00:48:00.417 --> 00:48:02.291
and give a hand to all these people

00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:05.208
who have come from Holland and Belgium.

00:48:12.458 --> 00:48:14.458
I wanted to give them the...

00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:16.333
Warren?

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.583
And the photographs are there,

00:48:30.875 --> 00:48:33.166
which you all can distribute because there are so many.

00:48:33.417 --> 00:48:36.291
So those who are going just now first,

00:48:36.542 --> 00:48:38.583
should get first, then gradually...

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.375
So I'll take your leave now,

00:48:43.375 --> 00:48:46.000
then distribution can be done.

00:48:55.333 --> 00:48:58.583
Now, I want to thank you all for inviting Me

00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:00.583
to this seminar,

00:49:00.959 --> 00:49:03.000
and it was so beautiful.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.750
I hope you won't take anything,

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.875
any when I told you about this Vishnumaya.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.875
That's the power, remember, that's the power.

00:49:13.083 --> 00:49:15.667
You all have to have that power within you,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.458
so when you speak even a word it acts like a lightning,

00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:24.000
and then like a rainbow.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.417
Both are the powers of Vishnumaya.

00:49:26.667 --> 00:49:27.875
When rainbow appears,

00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.291
that means there won't be any lightning,

00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:31.875
and when there is lightning there won't be any rainbow.

00:49:32.166 --> 00:49:35.291
So you are also the rainbow.

00:49:35.542 --> 00:49:39.875
That means you can create

00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:42.667
beautiful colors out of one white color,

00:49:42.917 --> 00:49:44.999
that's what you are capable of.

00:49:44.999 --> 00:49:47.417
So you have to show that magic,

00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:52.792
and also you have to show sometimes that lightning effect.

00:49:53.083 --> 00:49:56.291
But better take more the lightning inside

00:49:56.542 --> 00:49:59.208
and the rainbow outside,

00:50:00.291 --> 00:50:02.291
that would be better.

00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:05.875
May God bless you all.

00:52:32.709 --> 00:52:36.041
May God bless English and the others,

00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:41.166
all of you who desire to create Jerusalem in England

00:52:41.166 --> 00:52:42.750
- it's very important!

00:52:43.083 --> 00:52:47.834
Let the English also understand and be aware of this,

00:52:48.041 --> 00:52:49.417
and work it out.

00:52:49.417 --> 00:52:53.500
Not only the English Sahaja yogis, but all the English.

00:52:53.875 --> 00:52:57.166
May God bless you!
