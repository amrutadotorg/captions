WEBVTT

00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:13.121
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:28.777
I had also told you earlier in
Yamuna Nagar what the Truth is.

00:00:30.388 --> 00:00:36.238
When we seek without knowing the
Truth, we go astray.

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:48.525
Especially in Haryana I see, that
there is a huge market of gurus
settled here.

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:53.932
Gurus of all kinds are living here.
Some are of one kind, some of another.

00:00:53.932 --> 00:01:01.723
Some give a name to someone, while
some tell someone to chant for so
many days.

00:01:01.848 --> 00:01:09.058
If there's nothing new happening, then
they say, "Well, you give me this much
money, then you'll be fine."

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.410
Those who do all these trades should
know that there cannot be any
business of God.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.546
And whoever does will have to pay dearly.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:30.094
But even those who go to them are
deeply saddened. They get badly
destroyed.

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:39.555
I saw a gentleman had just arrived
in Chandigarh, was all wrinkled.

00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:42.490
A young man, he was all wrinkled.

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:49.571
Met another gentleman who started telling,
"I have been giving money to this
Radha Swami for fourteen years."

00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:54.919
I didn't find anything, and I'm so
sick, I can't walk, my arms and
legs are shaking."

00:01:55.006 --> 00:02:00.556
Oh, the guru who can't even give
you your health and robs you of
your money,

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:04.379
at least think with your intellect too.

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:08.551
You are intelligent people. What
kind of influence do gurus have?

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:15.408
So, the first thing I'm going to tell
you today, is how to recognize a Guru
– is a very important thing.

00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:18.094
Because its market is set up here.

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:26.618
That day there were at least 40 to 50
people in Kurukshetra who were absolutely
struck by gurus.

00:02:27.727 --> 00:02:30.227
And a few gurus also came with them.

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:37.025
They have no fear of God.
They want to befool.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:42.135
It's okay if they just take money.
They're ruining your Kundalini.

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:47.404
They ruin your health, children die.
All sorts of things happen.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:52.376
And what they do is spiritism,
crematorium devilry.

00:02:53.314 --> 00:02:59.484
Everybody in our country knows about
black magic. There is something called
black magic, everybody knows it.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:08.045
And by doing that, they're destroying people.
On one side they're destroying people, and
making a lot of money for themselves.

00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:10.844
But their mind(intellect) is completely
upside down.

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:14.893
Even a dirty man like Rajneesh is
held in high esteem by the people.

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:22.591
Tell Me, the one who has no place in any
country, who is such a filthy man that
even mentioning his name is filth,

00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:27.637
I don't understand how people in India
can think highly of such a man.

00:03:27.637 --> 00:03:34.717
He lives in Poona, but no Indians
come there. They come from your
place, from Haryana.

00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:42.536
I've heard, people drink alcohol here,
and they're searching for all the
(UNCLEAR) in alcohol.

00:03:42.536 --> 00:03:46.717
When man gets money, then he does
something or the other like this

00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:49.983
so that he may be destroyed. Should
think of some good work as well.

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:56.934
What's done is done. But now these
gurus are completely bad.

00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:06.305
Once they stick, can't get rid of them.
- now, this is the first thing.

00:04:07.412 --> 00:04:16.302
He did all this simply by mesmerizing
people and making them forget,

00:04:16.302 --> 00:04:18.483
that they just couldn't see what all
they were doing.

00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:24.805
And now after this, along with
their (UNCLEAR) and with their
tongues and with their heart

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:31.293
when they went to him, there were
four cameras installed. And the
four cameras caught it.

00:04:31.612 --> 00:04:34.902
Because you can't mesmerize the cameras.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.496
They can't be misguided as these
people have been.

00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:44.416
And even after being caught, people still
believe in him. It's a very sad thing.

00:04:44.838 --> 00:04:50.618
There is devotion within us, there is
a search within us, we are searching
for the Truth.

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:56.256
What did Nanak Sahib say? "Guru is
the one who unites you to the Lord."

00:04:56.256 --> 00:05:00.166
A Guru is one who talks about
uniting us with God.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:07.329
Those who talk nonsense like, "Give
this much money, do this, serve me,"
these people are not gurus.

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:15.947
Gave all the wrong mantras. Not everyone
has the right to give mantras also.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:19.328
And which mantra should be given,
there is a science for that too.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.670
What will happen even if a donkey
gets up and gives some mantras?

00:05:23.536 --> 00:05:27.866
Your those (UNCLEAR) who came here, they
gave the mantra Inga, Pinga and Thinga.

00:05:27.866 --> 00:05:34.805
Tell me which mantras are these? And
he said, "Don't tell anyone, with
great difficulty I told you."

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:40.016
This shouldn't be told to anyone. These
poor, simple foreigners don't know
anything about Inga, Pinga or Thinga.

00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:46.691
Kept saying the same mantra for years.
They went mad, developed epilepsy,
and their condition worsened.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.550
Now, later on, started saying that
you didn't move around in this
(UNCLEAR - Manner?).

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.989
You (UNCLEAR) what's the use/what
will be achieved?

00:05:55.572 --> 00:06:00.102
As it is cars are a problem, and on
top of that, with everyone jumping
around - what's the need for this?

00:06:00.102 --> 00:06:07.914
What have you come to achieve? What
do you want to achieve? You want to
know the Truth, right?

00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:21.068
So what is the Truth? You are not the
body, the mind, these emotions,
these values, none of these.

00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:28.502
You are the Pure Spirit. Firstly,
know that when you say,

00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:35.871
'This is my body, this is my intellect,'
so who is this 'I'? Should know that 'I'.

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:40.796
And to know that I-I, you
don't have to do anything.

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:45.988
You have all the preparations within
you as described. Kundalini is to be
awakened.

00:06:46.628 --> 00:06:49.688
But now there is no need to go to
these false(misleading) gurus.

00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:54.555
One gentleman started saying that,
"Mother, I will also practice Sahaja Yoga
and go to the fake Gurus as well."

00:06:55.035 --> 00:07:00.265
So then I said, "If you put one foot
in the crocodile's mouth, how will
you get into My boat?"

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:08.457
But you know this very well, you are not
[UNCLEAR] I would say, you are innocent,

00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:17.145
so, in your innocence, you go there. But
leave it now, all these things are useless.

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:20.801
You've been doing the same thing
for years, and will keep doing
it on for years.

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:25.040
Well, did you get anything from this?
You should think about it first.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.909
So I spoke about it today because
when I came back after travelling
all around Haryana,

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:39.135
then I came to know that there's
more than required network of the
false gurus here.

00:07:39.594 --> 00:07:43.384
I think all the gurus from Haridwar
have come and settled here.

00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:47.821
And they've just set up a shop,
though they may have just been
released from jail.

00:07:47.821 --> 00:07:53.283
Didn't find out who was the father,
who was the mother, nothing, and
have no knowledge, nothing.

00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:58.359
This Rajneesh didn't even know Sanskrit.
He's completely a useless man.

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:06.172
Similarly, I have heard about many
people here, one is this, then another
is that, then another is that.

00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:12.139
Don't know why, perhaps because people
of Haryana used to live more in the
countryside earlier,

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:17.682
it's possible that's why everyone is
so simple-hearted. They thought,
'First catch me only.'

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.820
No where are there so many false
gurus as there are here.

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:29.172
And the first one to come to Me
was Dr. Talwar.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:35.940
His guru, started a fight in the
entire house, took away everyone's
property, did everything.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.852
Then to these people didn't understand
how much harm was caused to them.

00:08:40.463 --> 00:08:47.163
She used to say, "What is all this
wealth? It's nothing but dust.
Give it to me."

00:08:47.163 --> 00:08:50.910
Oh, if it's dust for these humans,
then it should be ashes for you.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.995
(UNCLEAR) Sitting there as an ascetic.

00:08:54.565 --> 00:09:00.312
So, all of you should become cautious.
I want - there has been a lot of
awakening in Yamuna Nagar,

00:09:00.312 --> 00:09:03.436
and here we should be most cautious
in that way.

00:09:03.436 --> 00:09:07.748
As soon as money comes to you,
just like a fly goes to jaggery,

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:12.811
similarly, all these gurus will
rip you off in one way or another.

00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:16.131
Not only money, they will destroy
in every way.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:21.329
You will get cancer, you will get
all sorts of diseases, you will
get heart attacks;

00:09:21.329 --> 00:09:26.203
I have seen all the disciples
of Bala Swami, Radha Swami.
They have heart problems.

00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:30.046
Whosoever you see has a heart problem.
Young men get heart attacks.

00:09:30.046 --> 00:09:34.916
Well, your guru is very great. Said,
"Sir, I'm big, have an organization."

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:38.622
What are we supposed to do with it?
Even thieves can have an organization.

00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:43.951
As a Mother, I want to tell you today

00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:48.825
that there's no need to go to any
guru - I'll make you your own guru.

00:09:48.825 --> 00:09:54.634
Yes, there have been. I'm not saying there
haven't been gurus - there have been many real
gurus, but there's a way to identify them.

00:09:54.634 --> 00:09:58.179
What have his disciples achieved?

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:05.150
What have they received? What are
they like, we should see that.
We should see how they behave.

00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:09.631
Then you will know how the gurus
themselves behave.

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:13.826
It's the guru only who instills such
things in our minds. They are the ones who
run (carry on) such pursuits of the world.

00:10:20.158 --> 00:10:25.308
So, you should just remain (UNCLEAR)
aloof from all these things, give them up,

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:30.724
should be finished. It's very important
if your children are also going to it.

00:10:30.724 --> 00:10:38.801
This land of Haryana is so lush
and green, so sometimes it feels scary

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:43.349
that if these evil people destroyed it,
what will happen to the people here?

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:51.889
Now the other thing I want to tell is
that, the second Truth is that all
around spread

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:58.001
this Conscious Power, is Itself the
love of God — is the Supreme Love.

00:10:58.594 --> 00:11:06.624
Selfless, God loves you so much,
He has such a passion for you.

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:15.028
Until you understand the passion of
that God, you will continue to do
all wrong things of the world.

00:11:15.028 --> 00:11:20.341
Like someone said, "I fast for God."
Now think over, that God,

00:11:20.745 --> 00:11:29.315
He is your Father. Which father
would want his child to fast?

00:11:30.195 --> 00:11:36.638
And which Mother would that be - on the
contrary, when we are angry with our
mothers, then we fast to trouble them.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.790
So, leave all these fasting etc, penance
and chanting(spiritual practices) of the world.

00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:46.116
Leave them and attain your Pure Spirit.

00:11:46.143 --> 00:11:51.863
Because God Almighty is the embodiment
of love, and His kingdom awaits you.

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:55.475
You come and be seated in it

00:11:55.475 --> 00:11:59.924
and what all are His Blessings,
be nourished with them.

00:11:59.924 --> 00:12:05.630
Having received those blessings, may
you enjoy happiness, peace and joy.

00:12:07.308 --> 00:12:15.288
This is the only desire of God,
and it can only happen when you
are united with Him.

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:19.866
With this Power, with the Power of
God Almighty, how will you be connected?

00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:30.572
Just as there is this thing to connect
this instrument, similarly, there is a
Power within you called Kundalini.

00:12:30.572 --> 00:12:40.433
When it is awakened, it passes through
the six chakras and connects you

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:47.315
with the All-Pervading Power of God's
love; Then there is a complete
transformation within you.

00:12:47.874 --> 00:12:53.254
A person becomes so beautiful,
as if he is an angel.

00:12:53.328 --> 00:12:59.698
His life becomes so beautiful, he
becomes quite like an angel of god.

00:13:00.122 --> 00:13:07.452
Everything is so wonderful, and
the greatest thing about it is

00:13:07.452 --> 00:13:11.465
that it's your own power that's
working out.

00:13:11.506 --> 00:13:17.286
This power, which is your own, awakens.
Your own power heals you.

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:20.080
I have nothing to do with that.

00:13:20.338 --> 00:13:24.228
One lamp is lit, and then it can
enlighten many more lamps.

00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:32.163
This is Sahaja Yoga. In Sahaja Yoga there's
nothing to do with money or anything else.

00:13:32.264 --> 00:13:38.264
It's a very simple thing: that
we have this power within us,
which awakens.

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:45.473
And it also gives us union with
that Great Power.

00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:50.912
This is your right because you are seekers.
What all you have done for God,

00:13:51.123 --> 00:13:54.813
so you have the right to achieve all
of this.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:04.220
And after having received this, in
your home, in your society, what
to say, in your ...

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:11.072
and throughout the country, even
throughout the world, a complete
transformation takes place.

00:14:11.072 --> 00:14:18.332
And the whole world can change,
everything can be set right, and
the time for that has come today.

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:23.406
I call it the Blossom Time, many
flowers have come into the world,

00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:30.321
But now, somehow, these should
become the fruit.

00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:36.819
And this time has come. Because of
this time, because of this special time...

00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:49.489
Your well-being is being achieved only
because of this time. I have no
special role in this.

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:56.180
Everyone has done all the work in
their own times, and today is the
work of awakening which I am doing.

00:14:56.239 --> 00:14:59.749
If you ask Me to do it, I do it;
otherwise, I don't do it.

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:08.513
Everything is happening on its own. Thus,
one small thing should be understood.

00:15:08.821 --> 00:15:11.931
There can be no pressure on anyone
in this.

00:15:13.482 --> 00:15:17.782
You have complete freedom, you may
go to Hell or go to Heaven.

00:15:17.859 --> 00:15:22.939
No one can stop you from doing this.
God has given you some freedom after all.

00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:26.842
Animals are in the bondage of God,
but you have freedom.

00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:30.571
If you want you can go to Hell, or
you can go to Heaven, if you want.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.300
So there can be no compulsion.
- that's the first thing.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.486
And the second thing is that you
should not think wrong(negative)
things about yourself.

00:15:38.486 --> 00:15:42.745
Many people might have said to you,
"You are a great sinner, you did this, you" -

00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:49.291
There's no such thing. After all,
you're human, and humans do make
mistakes. You're not God.

00:15:49.933 --> 00:15:53.133
So lowering(degrading) yourself in
some way, or

00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:58.462
saying things like, "What am I, how will
I get it, Mother," etc. is very wrong.

00:16:00.102 --> 00:16:07.002
You should think that, "If I have come
as a human being,"

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:13.189
"and now if I have the right to have
it, why shouldn't I receive it?"

00:16:13.329 --> 00:16:16.679
And I'm telling you repeatedly that
you have a right.

00:16:17.495 --> 00:16:23.785
In this entire system created by God,
today is such a time,

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:30.101
that the Satyayug has now begun. This
work is bound to happen in it, and that's
why you are receiving it.

00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:36.333
Don't know how many virtuous deeds
you have done in your previous lives
that you are here today.

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:46.105
And whatever virtuous deeds you have
done, are bearing fruit today;
you are benefiting from them.

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:57.448
So, a kind of faith towards yourself,
a kind of belief, and especially
this desire in your heart,

00:16:57.448 --> 00:17:04.923
that, 'I should have self-realization.'
And will happen only through faith.
That's how everything happens.

00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:09.164
Have complete faith in yourself and
this thing will happen.

00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:15.974
Actually, you people had a very long
program today, so I think you've
heard it all.

00:17:15.974 --> 00:17:20.621
And there's nothing special to be
told, it's about getting it.

00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:26.457
So now, please, if you people have
any doubts, suspicions, or thoughts,

00:17:26.457 --> 00:17:33.267
or if you have any questions, then
again I would say that you write
them down and send them here

00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:37.932
so that they can be considered.
But this is beyond the intellect.

00:17:38.476 --> 00:17:46.906
If you ask Me a question, I can
definitely answer it because
I am very clever.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.670
No one in the world can answer for the
whole (UNCLEAR) like (UNCLEAR - I can?)

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.297
But of what use is this cleverness?
It won't bring about awakening.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:03.870
Awakening requires a desire in your
heart to attain self-realization.

00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:24.698
The other thing I've seen is that you
are sitting in a very sacred place.
This India is a land of yoga.

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:29.643
And being born here is also due
to one's former virtues.

00:18:29.643 --> 00:18:36.427
So, you have been born in this
country India and you don't have
to work hard herein.

00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:40.649
People, don't know how, but get
their realization just like that.

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:44.700
With these people, with these
foreigners, have to work very hard.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.926
But not with you people, because
otherwise too, no matter what,
we have dharma within us.

00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:55.946
That's why we have awe of God and
have dharma within us. That's not
found in these people.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:02.480
Then to, these poor people, in whatever
condition they were, stood up as lotus
flowers bloom.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.942
It is a matter of great surprise
and became fragrant. These people
have become so profound.

00:19:08.388 --> 00:19:13.948
They too must have had the good
deeds of their previous lives,
and they are doing so much work

00:19:13.948 --> 00:19:19.644
that it amazes Me, that those who
have never even thought about God,

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:26.749
who don't even know what self-realization
is, have gone so deep.

00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:33.825
This is such a time, and I hope
and believe that all of you will
get realization today.

00:19:34.169 --> 00:19:38.649
Now I will say again that if you
all sit down, I will give you
realization.

00:19:38.649 --> 00:19:44.961
It'll be good to sit down. This
land where you're standing is a
sacred land; everyone sit down.

00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:50.036
It's not necessary to look at Me
— you'll get realization without
even seeing. Please sit down.

00:19:52.774 --> 00:20:01.404
It is a great coincidence that you
have come today and whatever powers
you possess will be awakened.

00:20:01.677 --> 00:20:07.317
Your own power that is the Kundalini,
will provide you with all your powers.

00:20:22.905 --> 00:20:27.225
Please put both your hands towards Me.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:49.478
If you're wearing shoes, you'll
have to take them off; but
otherwise, it's fine.

00:20:50.908 --> 00:20:55.698
Children, place both hands like
this then everyone's Kundalini
will be awakened. Do it.

00:20:55.698 --> 00:21:00.267
Everyone is watching you to see
how you do it, whether you are
good children or not. Yes.

00:21:00.267 --> 00:21:02.925
Sit with both hands like this.
Very good.

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:18.532
Now eyes have to be closed, take
off your glasses, and open them
only when I tell you to.

00:21:19.432 --> 00:21:26.372
Everyone close your eyes. It's a
very simple method. But everyone
close your eyes.

00:21:26.372 --> 00:21:29.485
You people sit down, why are you
wandering around? Sit down, sit down.

00:21:29.694 --> 00:21:33.924
Sit down wherever you can find
space. No one should be seen
roaming around.

00:21:34.008 --> 00:21:40.058
You will have to listen to Me at least
this much, please. And no one should
remain standing. Sit down, sit down.

00:21:43.892 --> 00:21:50.242
Or those who don't want to stay
can leave, because I can't force
anyone here.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:57.199
So those who want to go, should go,
and those who want to sit, should sit.
Sit down.

00:22:09.044 --> 00:22:11.254
Close your eyes.

00:22:21.183 --> 00:22:23.834
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:25.363 --> 00:22:29.683
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:33.024
Please increase the volume.

00:22:34.099 --> 00:22:36.339
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:36.762 --> 00:22:40.712
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:41.488 --> 00:22:46.008
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:46.315 --> 00:22:51.145
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:51.324 --> 00:22:55.625
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:22:56.008 --> 00:22:59.818
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:23:00.239 --> 00:23:05.179
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:23:06.107 --> 00:23:18.167
[Shri Mataji blows air into the mic]

00:23:18.494 --> 00:23:21.314
Please open your eyes.

00:23:27.596 --> 00:23:38.196
Now, place your left hand towards Me
and bend your head to see if cool air
is coming from your palate.

00:23:38.196 --> 00:23:41.538
Please put your left hand towards Me,
bend your head

00:23:41.538 --> 00:23:47.090
and see from the fontanel bone area,
if a cool or a hot breeze is coming.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.020
Sometimes hot air also comes out.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:55.722
Don't place your hand on your head,
away from it, and observe whether
a warm or cool breeze is coming.

00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:03.564
Bend your head, bend your head.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.010
Now, please put your right hand
towards Me.

00:24:09.836 --> 00:24:17.236
Now place your right hand towards Me
and again bend your neck and see
with your left hand.

00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:21.055
Cool or hot air is coming.

00:24:28.034 --> 00:24:32.534
If warm air is coming, means you
forgive everyone.

00:24:32.534 --> 00:24:35.888
Forgiving everyone your anger will
calm down instantly.

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:39.889
So you forgive or don't, you don't
do anything.

00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:45.073
But when you don't forgive, you get
angry, and you keep troubling yourself.

00:24:45.073 --> 00:24:47.522
So it is better that you forgive everyone.

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:56.995
Please put your left hand towards Me.

00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:58.917
Again bend your head and see.

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:13.693
Sometimes this air comes till a
distance, sometimes it comes close.
Just see.

00:25:24.621 --> 00:25:34.681
Hmm! Now raise both hands to the
sky and tilt your head back.

00:25:35.248 --> 00:25:46.378
And ask a question, "Mother, is this the
Param Chaitanya? Is this the Brahma Chaitanya."
Ask this question three times.

00:25:46.437 --> 00:25:52.147
Please ask three times the question,
"Mother, is this the Cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost,"

00:25:52.404 --> 00:25:58.864
or "Mother, is this the All-Pervading
Power of Divine Love." Please put back
your head.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:17.200
Now bring your hands down. Put both
hands towards Me and stop thinking.
Become thoughtless.

00:26:28.415 --> 00:26:30.085
Like this.

00:26:30.482 --> 00:26:35.652
Please put both your hands towards Me
and stop thinking.

00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:40.132
This is the first state which is
called thoughtless awareness.

00:26:40.362 --> 00:26:45.762
The state that follows is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.
You will achieve that very quickly.

00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:51.562
But you will have to come to the collective,
you will have to come to our centers.

00:26:51.562 --> 00:26:57.549
Sahaja Yoga has spread very widely
in Yamuna Nagar and has many deep
people in it.

00:27:00.832 --> 00:27:10.542
Now, those who are feeling cool or hot
air in their fingers, hands, or head,

00:27:11.435 --> 00:27:13.925
should consider themselves spiritual.

00:27:18.653 --> 00:27:22.833
Didn't I tell you, Indians don't take
much time to achieve realization.

00:27:22.833 --> 00:27:29.226
There are very few people who don't
have it, very few.
Infinite blessings!

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:37.160
It doesn't happen to some people.
The reason is that there're some
mental reactions involved.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.031
You are constantly thinking about
something or the other, and you don't
receive what you have to.

00:27:42.401 --> 00:27:44.811
Mental reactions have to be reduced.

00:27:44.811 --> 00:27:51.618
With mental silence, they can all
be completely nourished by it.

00:27:51.618 --> 00:27:56.615
And you all have the right, I am
saying it again and again, get it.

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:06.001
Have all the children felt a cool breeze?
Did all the children feel a cool breeze?

00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:10.265
Children: Yes
Shri Mataji: Yes?
Children: Yes!

00:28:21.671 --> 00:28:24.731
Shri Mataji: He will now tell you
the addresses of the centres.

00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:29.678
You all write it and start going
to the centers.

00:28:29.678 --> 00:28:35.969
Sahaja Yogi: We have four centres in
Yamuna Nagar which are already running.

00:28:36.544 --> 00:28:44.444
The person who currently manages
Yamuna Nagar, Virendra Malik ji,
will tell you their addresses.

00:28:46.265 --> 00:28:53.765
Those brothers and sisters who have
felt slightly less, or haven't felt
at all,

00:28:54.037 --> 00:28:57.748
we'll tell them about the centers
and have someone pick them up.

00:28:57.748 --> 00:29:02.703
And he will personally attend, meaning
he will sit and pay attention to you.

00:29:03.092 --> 00:29:07.792
And you will feel this love
within 5-10 minutes

00:29:10.243 --> 00:29:24.413
This is for my foreign brothers and
sisters after one song or maybe two,
I'll request, Nigel, Nigel, where are you?

00:29:27.112 --> 00:29:30.412
When we start this song, we'll go to the
buses.

00:29:32.633 --> 00:29:37.513
Okay! This is when we finish this song
not before that. Sorry!

00:29:38.682 --> 00:29:43.282
Mr. Virendra Malik, please come and
give these brothers and sisters the
addresses of this place.

00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:48.329
Please tell on which day your
program is held, at which centre,
and at what time.

00:29:50.191 --> 00:30:02.971
Jai Shri Mataji! Four centers run
in Yamuna Nagar. The first is 888,
Prem Nagar, Yamuna Nagar.

00:30:03.624 --> 00:30:16.204
The second is 316 Model Town,
Yamuna Nagar and the third is
595 Santpura Road, Yamuna Nagar.

00:30:16.204 --> 00:30:30.439
The fourth is Gauravati School,
Raghav Road, Yamuna Nagar. Its
director is M.C. Shravan Kumar.

00:30:33.895 --> 00:30:39.465
[Sahaja Bhajan - Bolo Adishakti, Shri Mataji,
Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai] [ From 30:33 to 36:09]

00:36:10.157 --> 00:36:15.027
[Sahaj Bhajan - Teri bindiya pyari
laage Ma use dekhta jaoon]
[From 36:10 to 40:52]

00:36:39.617 --> 00:36:46.257
Sahaja Yogi: The brothers and sisters who
are standing, please clap and, if you
listen to me, sit down, if possible.

00:40:51.695 --> 00:40:56.805
Hail Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi!
(Bolo Shri Adishakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jai!)

00:40:59.282 --> 00:41:05.182
Sahaja Yogi: All (UNCLEAR) as quickly as
possible (UNCLEAR) come. All the brothers
who are leaving come to the camp quickly.
