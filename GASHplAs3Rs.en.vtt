WEBVTT

00:33.280 --> 00:40.090
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:40.090 --> 00:47.090
When we are seeking the Truth we have to know
we have to be honest about it. Because it

00:54.610 --> 01:01.610
is benevolent for us, not for others. We are
seeking the Truth for ourselves, not for others.

01:05.199 --> 01:12.199
The another thing we have to remember, very
humbly, that truth is what it is. We can not

01:16.020 --> 01:23.020
change it, we can not organize it, we can
not maneuver it. It is what has been and will

01:25.590 --> 01:26.490
be.

01:26.490 --> 01:33.490
And what is the Truth? The truth is that you
are the Spirit. You are not this body, you

01:40.070 --> 01:47.070
are not this mind, you are not this ego, and
you are not this conditioning. You are the

01:48.939 --> 01:55.939
Spirit.
But so far you have been a humane being. But

01:56.329 --> 02:03.329
to be humane being itself is a very great
thing. Is the greatest thing – to be a humane

02:08.340 --> 02:15.340
being. Perhaps we have not realized the value
of our life because we do not know what we

02:17.609 --> 02:24.609
are. The way we waste our time, waste our
energies, waste our attention on things, which

02:28.670 --> 02:35.670
are senseless, because we still have to understand
the greatness of our being. Humane beings

02:40.920 --> 02:47.920
are made with such care, so beautifully, such
delicate working of the Divine from ameba

02:54.349 --> 03:00.459
to this stage passing through various stages,
such a beautiful thing has been created as

03:00.459 --> 03:03.209
a humane being.

03:03.209 --> 03:10.209
But first we must have this attention to our
Self that there must be something. It can

03:11.010 --> 03:18.010
not be a purposelessly [WAY or DOING], it
can not be something just a chance. Is a wrong

03:18.870 --> 03:25.870
idea to play with. If the gravitation force
of the Earth or anyone of the galaxies changes,

03:32.189 --> 03:38.870
then be disaster, absolute disaster.

03:38.870 --> 03:44.450
So many things in the cosmos, if you study,
the coefficients that works out, the different

03:44.450 --> 03:51.450
balancing and the different weights and the
movements of the different bodies show us

03:51.870 --> 03:58.870
that there must be some purpose. And they
do not trouble us; it’s all as if made for

04:01.450 --> 04:06.299
the stage for humane beings. That the humane
beings have to come on the stage and all the

04:06.299 --> 04:13.299
preparation is made for the great drama. I
think it’s high time that great scientists

04:15.120 --> 04:22.120
should look at it and start wondering why
is it the way it is made. Why we are so much

04:22.909 --> 04:29.909
looked after. The whole cosmos seems to be
within ourselves as if we have buttons, which

04:32.820 --> 04:39.820
move the cosmos, which control the cosmos.
Everything is going on so smoothly otherwise,

04:42.229 --> 04:46.690
except when we do not try to understand ourselves.

04:46.690 --> 04:53.690
It has been said practically in all the Scriptures
that you have to seek your Self; you have

04:57.009 --> 05:04.009
to find your Self. Though I think many of
this Scriptures have been little bit changed

05:06.479 --> 05:13.479
and have been used for certain purposes, still
they could not get over this point that you

05:15.620 --> 05:21.570
have to become the Self, you have to be born
again.

05:21.570 --> 05:28.570
But that is not an artificial thing. We are
humane beings not artificially made. We are

05:30.039 --> 05:37.039
made really by some sort of a living force
from ameba. We are not just made with some

05:39.370 --> 05:46.240
sort of a thinking or a mental projection.
It is not a mental projection by which we

05:46.240 --> 05:53.020
have been humane beings, it is something spontaneously
happening, a living force within us, which

05:53.020 --> 05:58.440
has brought us to this stage - with a purpose,
with a meaning.

05:58.440 --> 06:05.440
And now at this stage we are free to do what
we like. Many people ask Me, “What was the

06:07.300 --> 06:13.740
need to give this freedom to humane beings?”
It was very necessary. If you have to have

06:13.740 --> 06:20.740
the ultimate freedom you must know how to
deal with it. You have to understand. Of course,

06:22.569 --> 06:29.569
humane beings have to make mistakes. To err
is humane. And we have to understand that

06:30.630 --> 06:37.630
this trial – error and trial and error business
– has made us understand, also those who

06:42.190 --> 06:49.190
have not understood must understand, that
there must be a wiser or surer way to achieve

06:50.990 --> 06:53.590
that goal of Self-Realization, of Self-knowledge.

06:53.590 --> 07:00.590
Self-knowledge we do not have, we must admit
very humbly, we have had no system by which

07:05.210 --> 07:12.210
we could know ourselves. But think of a computer
that is a humane being is. As soon as you

07:13.550 --> 07:19.840
see Me you know I am there. You don’t have
to go for programming, you don’t have to

07:19.840 --> 07:26.840
consult anything, you don’t have to use
any kind of computer or some sort of a complicated

07:28.639 --> 07:34.690
machinery, automatically, spontaneously in
a split of a second you know that I’m standing

07:34.690 --> 07:40.639
before you and talking to you. Such a computer
we can not create. But the Divine has created

07:40.639 --> 07:46.789
such a great computer and that is the humane
being. And this humane being is the only one

07:46.789 --> 07:53.500
who is going to achieve that higher state,
which we call as the spiritual state of the

07:53.500 --> 07:55.259
Self.

07:55.259 --> 08:02.259
Because in the science they deal with the
tree, I should say, the outside, but they

08:03.569 --> 08:10.569
can not go into the roots. To go into the
roots you have to become a subtler being.

08:11.610 --> 08:15.419
Unless and until you become a subtler being
you can not go into your roots to find out

08:15.419 --> 08:22.419
what are your roots are. And that is what
is Self-Realization. When you become subtler

08:22.909 --> 08:29.909
then only you can go into your being and can
find out what actually you are. Also to look

08:31.430 --> 08:38.430
after a tree, which has not know its roots,
is a very difficult thing. What happens is

08:39.199 --> 08:45.900
that when you do not know your roots and you
start growing, and growing, and growing you

08:45.900 --> 08:52.900
go very deep down into that where you find
that you have lost your way. Actually you

08:55.390 --> 09:02.390
are not going deeper. You are spreading outside
more and more. And then once you start going

09:02.390 --> 09:05.370
to extremes because of your freedom you lose
your way.

09:05.370 --> 09:12.329
That’s how today everybody is saying, “A
shock is going to come”. You are all going

09:12.329 --> 09:19.100
to face a shock. This is going to happen,
that is going to happen. But actually it is

09:19.100 --> 09:25.850
absolutely in your hands because the whole
of the cosmos is within you. The cosmos is

09:25.850 --> 09:32.850
working under your control complete. It is
absolutely looking after you. Every element

09:34.049 --> 09:41.049
is looking after you to preserve you, to guide
you, to take you to the right thinking.

09:41.610 --> 09:47.530
But in your freedom you have to achieve that.
This is a very big condition and there where

09:47.530 --> 09:52.850
we fail to understand. Even there are many
who say, “There is nothing like Divine”

09:52.850 --> 09:59.089
and, “There is nothing like God.” In Russia
I’ve been and I’ve been to China and all

09:59.089 --> 10:06.089
the communist countries and they are in a
way partially justify it. Because what they

10:06.199 --> 10:13.199
found, those people who talk of God, those
who say that, “We believe in God” and

10:13.750 --> 10:20.750
those who say that, “We believe in religion”,
can be irreligious. Anybody who can call himself

10:21.579 --> 10:28.500
a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, say, Farsi, anything,
is capable of any sin. Whatever he wants to

10:28.500 --> 10:35.500
do he can do it. Nobody can say that, “Because
he was a Christian he could not do it”.

10:37.299 --> 10:44.299
So the whole concept of religion becomes a
mental projection again an artificial thing.

10:46.540 --> 10:53.540
But if a person is a Self-Realized person
he goes beyond that, beyond temptations, beyond

10:56.640 --> 11:03.640
any kind of domination of any habits. He becomes
a very strong person, very powerful person

11:06.360 --> 11:13.360
and extremely compassionate. His compassion
is active. Is not a compassion that, “I’ll

11:14.679 --> 11:21.679
form a charitable institution, which lends
money to people”, is not like that. The

11:21.890 --> 11:28.890
being itself emits compassion and this compassion
acts, acts and works out. For example you

11:30.290 --> 11:36.890
become like a light which gives light to people
and to yourself. You know others and you know

11:36.890 --> 11:42.809
yourself. That is the light of the Truth and
unless and until that happens one should not

11:42.809 --> 11:49.809
say that, “I’m a Self-Realized soul”
or, “I am a twice born” – is artificial.

11:51.100 --> 11:58.100
So what you have to understand that we are
living in a relative world. We talk relatively.

12:01.439 --> 12:08.439
We have to be in the absolute world, where
the Truth is absolute. There now before you

12:08.880 --> 12:15.790
I’m standing, you know very well that I’m
wearing a sari, which is white. But it’s

12:15.790 --> 12:21.079
a relative still because somebody will say,
“Oh, maybe it’s white”. Somebody will

12:21.079 --> 12:28.079
say, “It’s of white”, somebody will
say like that. Still you know something, but

12:28.620 --> 12:35.620
to know it absolutely, meticulously the right
thing, you have to be the Spirit. But what

12:36.809 --> 12:42.290
you know is much more than these eyes can
see or this nose can smell. Is much more,

12:42.290 --> 12:49.290
much more explicit, much more clear cut. Like
a person who is suffering, say, from some

12:53.179 --> 13:00.179
disease. A child is suffering from some disease
and they don’t know what the disease is.

13:02.110 --> 13:09.110
So they have to go many various kinds of tests
and for that the gentlemen, the father, or

13:09.360 --> 13:14.520
the mother, they have to pay a lot of money.
They go on finding about the child, what’s

13:14.520 --> 13:18.010
wrong, what’s wrong, what’s wrong. They
can not find it, what’s wrong with the child.

13:18.010 --> 13:23.870
And they are so upset about it and within
three days a child dies and still the diagnoses

13:23.870 --> 13:30.870
is not coming. Is a very common thing. But
when you are a Self-Realized soul you can

13:32.760 --> 13:38.770
know what’s wrong with the child, exactly
you can put down your finger on the problem

13:38.770 --> 13:43.270
that he has.

13:43.270 --> 13:48.470
Now how does it happen? Here is already told
you about the charkas that we have, the centers

13:48.470 --> 13:54.579
within us. These are the centers, which on
one side control the cosmos, on the other

13:54.579 --> 14:00.530
side control us, give knowledge and on the
other side they give us the knowledge about

14:00.530 --> 14:03.790
others. These centers are within us.

14:03.790 --> 14:10.480
Now when I’m telling you all this you have
to have an open mind of a scientist. We shouldn’t

14:10.480 --> 14:16.490
just deny it because in your concept it doesn’t
fitting. But like a scientist please see to

14:16.490 --> 14:23.490
it that if it is proved you have to accept
that this is so. Now these charkas are within

14:24.419 --> 14:31.419
you, these centers are within you, and these
centers communicate to you through your fingertips

14:32.299 --> 14:38.959
what’s the matter with a child. You can
feel it on your fingertips, now five, six,

14:38.959 --> 14:44.299
and seven centers, right side, seven centers.
(Shri Mataji points to the chakra projections

14:44.299 --> 14:47.809
on Her left and right palms.) The right side
has got the seven centers, if they are decoded

14:47.809 --> 14:51.770
properly and if you know what is the decoding
is, putting the hand towards a child, for

14:51.770 --> 14:58.260
a Realized soul it is very easy to see where
is the problem. And as soon as he finds a

14:58.260 --> 15:02.600
problem and he knows how to cure it he can
cure people without going to doctors.

15:02.600 --> 15:09.260
Sahaja Yoga has cured, I must say, I don’t
want to claim it because I don’t want to

15:09.260 --> 15:16.260
open a hospital. We are here to create doctors
and not patients. So even some patients who

15:18.160 --> 15:24.370
have come to us have become doctors today
in a way that they diagnose it on their fingertips.

15:24.370 --> 15:31.370
As Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that, “At
the time of your resurrection your hands will

15:32.079 --> 15:38.240
speak”. But still nobody wants to know about
it, that’s called as a resurrection time,

15:38.240 --> 15:41.579
as [SOUNDS LIKE – Kayama], nobody wants
to talk about it. “Your hands will speak

15:41.579 --> 15:48.069
and will give evidence and witness against
you”, clearly He has said it, I must say,

15:48.069 --> 15:55.069
He’d done such a lot of work on the Self-knowledge;
as Christ has also said so many things.

15:58.230 --> 16:05.230
But people don’t want to look at that side.
Like to say that, “We must suffer” itself

16:05.900 --> 16:12.900
is a nonsense, I think, how can you. Any God
who is a compassionate Father would like His

16:13.360 --> 16:20.360
children to suffer to meet Him? I mean, it
doesn’t going to logic at all. But people

16:21.160 --> 16:28.160
accept this funny concept of sufferings. What
about Christ? He suffered for us, isn’t

16:28.439 --> 16:35.439
it? Isn’t it that He suffered for us? If
so, is has He left something for us to be

16:36.049 --> 16:43.049
done, to be completed more than He has suffered?
He has suffered for us and He has done the

16:50.220 --> 16:57.220
job fully. We don’t have to do any more
about it. He carried the cross. People make

17:01.919 --> 17:08.919
Him look like a TB patient, even worse than
that, just bones and the skins. It’s very

17:09.160 --> 17:16.160
surprising, how can you conceive Christ like
that?! Anyone of the people who say they are

17:19.459 --> 17:26.459
very healthy people, let them carry the cross
and we’ll see. It is so contradictory about

17:29.030 --> 17:36.030
Christ, there’s surprisingly that He should
say that you have to suffer.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.810
Same about Jews. I just don’t understand
why should they say that you have to suffer

17:43.810 --> 17:50.810
if their God is kind? Same about all other
organized; all these organized or perverted

17:53.050 --> 18:00.050
people who say that you have to suffer. Suddenly
people become vegetarians, suddenly they become

18:01.100 --> 18:04.950
fasting. In India though we have to fast in
any case because of lack of food, but they

18:04.950 --> 18:11.480
have fasting days. There are some people who
fast at least five days in a week. They fasting.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.860
What is the need to fast? If you ask for fasting
you’ll have to fast all your life. That’s

18:14.860 --> 18:21.140
what God gives you, “You fast now, you want
to fast? All right, have it fasting.” We

18:21.140 --> 18:28.140
are asking for trouble. You want to be miserable?
All right, be miserable. You want to be unhappy?

18:28.810 --> 18:30.930
All right, be unhappy.

18:30.930 --> 18:37.600
You find people coming out of congregations,
which are supposed to be very religious so

18:37.600 --> 18:44.600
miserable looking. How can it be? It has to
be joy, it has to be happiness. Just think

18:47.050 --> 18:53.350
of it, how can we ever believe such things
what we have believed for ages, ages, ages,

18:53.350 --> 19:00.350
and it can not go out of our heads, that we
have to suffer. How long, how many years,

19:03.190 --> 19:10.140
how many lives? Nothing is written anywhere.
You better go on suffering and make others

19:10.140 --> 19:16.640
suffer also with it. If some person is like
that in your family you’d like to run away

19:16.640 --> 19:19.560
with that boredom, because he’s suffering
for nothing at all and (Shri Mataji laughs)

19:19.560 --> 19:24.520
he don’t understand why is he suffering.
So you want to run away from such a person.

19:24.520 --> 19:31.520
And all this kind of ideas we have accepted
for ages now. And that has led us to a big

19:33.350 --> 19:34.550
confusion about God.

19:34.550 --> 19:41.550
Then we take to things which give us joy.
Actually they are not, they are just flippant

19:43.960 --> 19:48.890
pleasures. We can not enjoy anything in life,
really we can not. We can see the way people

19:48.890 --> 19:54.850
are now going on for such sensational things.
The reason is there’s no joy. The sensitivity

19:54.850 --> 20:01.850
to joy is so reduced that I sometimes fear
with all that they are doing they so fed up,

20:02.300 --> 20:08.810
that they may have to put electrodes in the
limbic area to get the joy instead. They have

20:08.810 --> 20:15.810
become so very (Shri Mataji smiles) so very
insensitive to anything, they’ll not laugh,

20:18.870 --> 20:25.870
they’ll not smile, they are so full of closed
hearts and frightened things, whatever they

20:26.430 --> 20:28.160
said about humane beings.

20:28.160 --> 20:35.160
Now first thing you have to know – you don’t
have to suffer at all. Secondly, you don’t

20:39.890 --> 20:43.590
have to judge yourself. Let your Kundalini
rise and judge you. You don’t start judging

20:43.590 --> 20:44.150
yourself and condemning yourself.

20:44.150 --> 20:51.150
And the another fashion, which is very common,
is to feel guilty. From the very beginning

20:52.330 --> 20:59.330
you start, “I am afraid”. What are you
afraid of? You have to have all the courage,

21:01.400 --> 21:08.400
all the blessings, and all the confidence.
You are a humane being and this is the message

21:08.600 --> 21:14.390
I want to tell you that you are a humane being
and you have to be the Spirit. And once you

21:14.390 --> 21:19.230
are the Spirit you’ll be surprised the blessings
will be showering upon you. In these modern

21:19.230 --> 21:24.030
times should talk about these things is out
of date. But it is predicted that this will

21:24.030 --> 21:31.030
be said and this will be done. For us it is
important first of all to know our own glory,

21:33.600 --> 21:40.600
our own truths, and about how we are built
and how others are built. Once you know that

21:41.010 --> 21:47.470
first of all the peace within is established.
Unless and until there is peace within what

21:47.470 --> 21:54.470
do you talk of this peace organization and
Peace Nobel Prize? I’ve seen the people

21:54.650 --> 22:01.650
who have gotten Nobel Prizes are the most
hot-headed so much that you have to talk to

22:04.600 --> 22:10.790
them with a barge pole in between. Any time
they are up to jump on you, you can not challenge

22:10.790 --> 22:16.530
them; even talking to them is a difficult
situation. So how are they going to have this

22:16.530 --> 22:21.370
peace foundation when they are themselves
so shaking?

22:21.370 --> 22:28.370
Then you have other things talking about – the
love, the love. Full of lust and greed. They

22:30.820 --> 22:37.820
love your purse, not you. When you talk of
love, love is a thing that’s detached. Like

22:41.590 --> 22:48.590
the sap in the tree rises, goes to all the
leaves, all the trunk, all the flowers, all

22:49.330 --> 22:56.330
the fruits and comes back, is not attached.
If it’s get attached to one fruit the tree

22:56.790 --> 23:03.710
will die and the fruit will die too. So this
Pure Love or the Divine Love is detached,

23:03.710 --> 23:10.710
that’s why it acts, it works. A person who
is a Realized soul is such a pure personality

23:14.870 --> 23:21.280
that even a glance of such a person can do
lots of things. Even a thought of such a person

23:21.280 --> 23:28.280
in the attention can do so many things, bring
about so many changes.

23:28.860 --> 23:35.860
So this is the time of our transformation.
We have to become a higher personality; the

23:39.000 --> 23:46.000
transformation has to take place. At the time
of Easter we give people eggs. Perhaps people

23:47.530 --> 23:53.730
do not know why do we give them eggs at the
time of Easter. But about Christ is written

23:53.730 --> 24:00.030
in our Scriptures that He was an egg to begin
with. Of course, He was much more before that,

24:00.030 --> 24:07.030
but to begin with He was the God of innocence.
But then He came as an egg. And then He was

24:10.200 --> 24:17.200
divided into two halves. The one half, which
incarnated, and which transformed this Earth.

24:19.920 --> 24:26.920
So the resurrection is the transformation.
Like an egg, if we are bound by our conditioning

24:28.200 --> 24:35.200
and by our ego, we break through that shell
and become a bird, which is really a free

24:35.460 --> 24:41.620
bird. Only thing, the bird has to know how
to fly. Now this is, again I’m saying is

24:41.620 --> 24:48.620
the living process of the living nature, of
the living Power of Love. It is not something

24:50.590 --> 24:57.590
artificial. In Sahaja Yoga, I must have spoken
in this hall I don’t know how many times

24:57.910 --> 25:02.830
might before and again today there’s a chance
to speak to you.

25:02.830 --> 25:09.490
What I have to say, that it is important the
becoming. Is not important: you can not become

25:09.490 --> 25:16.120
a member of Sahaj Yog, you can not pay membership,
you can not pay for your Realization. How

25:16.120 --> 25:23.120
can you pay? How much do we pay to the Mother
Earth to sprout the seed, does She understand?

25:23.300 --> 25:30.300
Because She has the power She sprouts the
seed. If you give Her money or read something

25:33.120 --> 25:39.320
before Her, it makes no difference. But once
you get your Realization you start understanding

25:39.320 --> 25:46.320
how many powers you have. And the greatest
power is of compassion and detached love.

25:48.930 --> 25:53.740
These seven chakras are within us, which are
to be enlightened by the awakening of the

25:53.740 --> 25:59.530
Kundalini about which Dr. Spiro has already
told you. Now in this short time I can not

25:59.530 --> 26:05.890
cover up the whole subject. I must have given
at least more than thousand lectures in English

26:05.890 --> 26:12.400
language. But I would request you one thing
that forget about what you have learned so

26:12.400 --> 26:19.400
far. About your conditionings because if you
had achieved anything out of that I was not

26:21.910 --> 26:28.910
necessary. Now you have to see with a clean
slate, as they say, what you can achieve in

26:29.860 --> 26:35.070
this lifetime, which is the most important
thing, is to be achieved.

26:35.070 --> 26:42.070
Of course, where’s a lot of things that
should really make you more tempting about

26:44.440 --> 26:51.420
it. Firstly, that you get rid of all your
illnesses. Most of the illnesses can be cured

26:51.420 --> 26:58.420
– if they are at an early stage – by Sahaja
Yoga. Most of the mental illnesses can be

26:59.510 --> 27:06.510
cured with Sahaja Yoga. Your material problems
can be solved by Sahaja Yoga. Your spiritual

27:09.020 --> 27:14.010
problems like going to wrong gurus and wrong
people whatever you have accumulated within

27:14.010 --> 27:21.010
you can be corrected. But the highest of all
that you become sensitive to joy. Then you

27:23.710 --> 27:28.900
start seeing joy in everything. You don’t
have to think that, “Oh, this is the thing

27:28.900 --> 27:35.900
which is marvelous”. No. It just happens,
you see it is. Just you enjoy without thinking

27:37.080 --> 27:39.370
about it.

27:39.370 --> 27:45.160
You become a peaceful personality. You become
a dynamic personality. Your are not spade

27:45.160 --> 27:51.230
by other veils of things, like some fashion
coming up, then some sort of a nonsensical

27:51.230 --> 27:56.720
idea coming up, then some medicine coming
up and you treating yourself and getting to

27:56.720 --> 28:01.590
trouble. You just rise above all the these
things at a higher level and you start see

28:01.590 --> 28:08.240
everything as a witness. You become the witness
of all the jokes that are going on and you

28:08.240 --> 28:15.240
just watch it and you think, “What’s all
this? Is just a play”. Many people have

28:16.370 --> 28:21.240
said that, “Mother, You always laugh so
much and You have always smiling face, so

28:21.240 --> 28:26.690
the people are not going to take You seriously”.
I said, “I don’t want them to be serious”.

28:26.690 --> 28:32.130
There’s not going to be any seriousness
needed. What are you serious about? You should

28:32.130 --> 28:38.300
be happy. It’s fun. We have to be happy
people. We have to be happy. Most people who

28:38.300 --> 28:44.080
think, they are very guilty, should punish
themselves by saying, “You are not guilty,

28:44.080 --> 28:49.840
you are not guilty” 108 times. That’s
what we have in Sahaja Yoga. Is just the myth.

28:49.840 --> 28:55.760
All these are myths; we are working with myths
and making our lives miserable, which is meant

28:55.760 --> 29:02.760
to be joy, happiness and all the overflowing
blessings of the Divine.

29:03.440 --> 29:10.440
Whatever I’m telling you about we have within
ourselves all the great powers hidden of our

29:11.550 --> 29:18.550
brain, of our liver, of our heart, – they
are to be enlightened. And then in the light

29:18.960 --> 29:24.500
you see everything. But as in this room you
have so many lights you have to just push

29:24.500 --> 29:29.630
in one button and the whole thing comes out.
In the same way it happens. But if I start

29:29.630 --> 29:35.450
telling you about the history of electricity
in the dark and all about how it came here

29:35.450 --> 29:41.910
and what all happened, you’d be just fed
up with it. So what we are doing is to tell

29:41.910 --> 29:47.070
you that let us put on the button first, you
better have your light and see in that light

29:47.070 --> 29:54.070
if it is true or not. If it is true you have
to understand and accept it honestly. You

29:54.940 --> 30:00.260
have to be honest to yourself that is the
main point I’m trying to tell you. We are

30:00.260 --> 30:05.080
not to play about with ourselves and play
about with our conditionings. We have to be

30:05.080 --> 30:11.330
honest and to get to our properties that are
within our selves. I’m not here to oblige

30:11.330 --> 30:16.880
you at all, there’s no obligation. Is just
like a catalyst, I would say, and you become

30:16.880 --> 30:22.740
the catalyst oneself once you get your Realization.
And you can do all that I can do, it’s very

30:22.740 --> 30:26.070
easy and very simple.

30:26.070 --> 30:30.179
May God bless you all.

30:30.179 --> 30:30.440
(Aside) Now, should we have questions or what?

30:30.440 --> 30:30.980
I find most of you were just ready for getting
Self-Realization. Not only that, but I think

30:30.980 --> 30:37.980
you all capable of that. But still there must
be some people who must be want to ask questions.

31:22.730 --> 31:28.100
I would only request – don’t be aggressive
with Me, there’s no need. I’ve not come

31:28.100 --> 31:35.100
here for votes, nor for any money, nor for
anything. I’ve just come here to give you

31:37.190 --> 31:44.190
your own keys. Out of Love that I am. So please
try to understand Me. I’m not here to take,

31:48.240 --> 31:55.240
I mean, anything from you. Just to show you
what you are and you’ll be happy to know

31:55.780 --> 31:57.760
that you are something great.

31:57.760 --> 32:04.760
So may God bless you, I would like you to
ask Me questions related to Self-Realization

32:05.610 --> 32:10.700
and not to waste the time of so many who look
so anxious to have their Self-Realization.

32:10.700 --> 32:17.700
Those who do not want to do any meditation
after this, which will take hardly ten minutes

32:18.740 --> 32:23.559
for you to get your Realization, because the
journey is three to four feet only – from

32:23.559 --> 32:27.610
here to here. (Shri Mataji shows the distance
from Mooladhar to Sahasrara Chakra with Her

32:27.610 --> 32:28.440
hand.) That’s all.

32:28.440 --> 32:34.950
So, I would just say, that you will all get
your Realization in no time. Should get your

32:34.950 --> 32:40.870
Realization, but do not try to be uncivil.
If you do not want to have it, you should

32:40.870 --> 32:46.330
leave the hall and leave others in peace.
That would be very kind of us. And not to

32:46.330 --> 32:52.420
see and watch, we don’t need such people
here. Those who want to have Realization can

32:52.420 --> 32:58.200
sit down or others have freedom to go, but
not freedom to sit here. So I would request

32:58.200 --> 33:05.200
you to be kind and civil to others who want
to receive their Realization.

33:06.910 --> 33:11.390
Any questions, please.

33:11.390 --> 33:15.860
Q.: [NOT AUDIBLE]

33:15.860 --> 33:18.850
What’s it?

33:18.850 --> 33:25.850
A Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he said that Dr. Spiro
couldn’t complete his talk about how the

33:46.450 --> 33:53.450
germinating principle works. Could You say
something to finish of what he said?

33:54.390 --> 33:56.309
Shri Mataji: Generating principle?

33:56.309 --> 33:57.380
The Sahaja Yogi: Germinating.

33:57.380 --> 34:02.220
Shri Mataji: You see, it is, I would say,
it is spontaneous. Now that should explain

34:02.220 --> 34:09.220
a little bit how does a seed germinate. You
have the seed and you put it in the Mother

34:14.710 --> 34:20.569
Earth, all right? And it germinates because
it’s all built in it, this is all built

34:20.569 --> 34:27.569
in it, all this is built in it. And in the
triangular bone you have got this Kundalini,

34:27.950 --> 34:33.010
which is placed within you in 3,5 coils of
an energy, which is a residual energy. Which

34:33.010 --> 34:40.010
is actually the power of your pure desire.
Because the desire that we have otherwise,

34:44.159 --> 34:51.159
all the desires, are not pure. What’s why
they are not satiable in general. We get one

34:51.470 --> 34:55.240
thing, we want to have another. We get the
another thing, you want to have the third

34:55.240 --> 34:55.659
thing.

34:55.659 --> 35:02.659
So this is the power of pure desire. And this
pure desire is described in the Bible as Holy

35:05.210 --> 35:12.210
Ghost, in the Koran as [SOUNDS LIKE – Asas]
and in the Indian Scriptures as Adi Shakti,

35:16.560 --> 35:23.560
as the Primordial Mother. So She is the power
of God as called as the Primordial Mother.

35:25.880 --> 35:32.880
Now this Primordial Mother is settled in our
triangular bone while the Spirit which is

35:33.869 --> 35:40.869
the reflection of God Almighty is in our heart.
But the seat of the heart is on top of your

35:42.640 --> 35:49.609
head – here – on the fontanel bone area,
which is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit

35:49.609 --> 35:56.609
language. And also when we talk of baptism
we try to bless there, but it’s artificial.

35:57.740 --> 36:04.740
Real baptism is when this Kundalini, which
is the Holy Ghost or the Adi Shakti, the reflection

36:06.130 --> 36:13.130
of that, rises within you piercing through
these centers, piercing through the fontanel

36:13.320 --> 36:20.320
bone area and actualizes the experience of
this personal experience and gives you a cool

36:22.000 --> 36:27.250
breeze coming out of your head. Actually the
cool breeze coming out of your head, you feel

36:27.250 --> 36:32.550
it, and then you feel it everywhere, the cool
breeze of the Holy Ghost. And that is the

36:32.550 --> 36:39.550
subtle of the subtlest, which is the syntheses
of all the powers, which works everything

36:41.650 --> 36:42.470
out.

36:42.470 --> 36:49.470
Like you can say, in the sulfur dioxide we
have in the molecule of the sulfur dioxide

36:49.710 --> 36:56.710
we find that there is pulsation of the vibrations.
Who does what? We say electromagnetic. But

36:56.990 --> 37:03.990
the electromagnetic is one part of the same
power. So this power we can broadly divide

37:03.990 --> 37:10.990
into three things. In the first power what
we call as the power by which we desire. The

37:11.280 --> 37:18.280
second power by which we act and the third
power by which we ascend. All the synthesis

37:20.570 --> 37:27.570
of all these powers, all these powers are
in this Kundalini which meets the Spirit because

37:32.400 --> 37:38.619
the seat of the Spirit, as they call the Pitha,
is on top of your head and that’s how the

37:38.619 --> 37:44.420
whole attention you can see like a sari it
is supposing the attention is spread here

37:44.420 --> 37:48.630
and the Kundalini rises, rises like that (Shri
Mataji puts Her finger under the sari on Her

37:48.630 --> 37:50.760
chest and erects it like a tent pole), pierces
through this at and the whole of this attention

37:50.760 --> 37:56.600
becomes enlightened. That’s how your attention
becomes enlightened. This is in short I’m

37:56.600 --> 38:03.260
telling you. But as I told you we have got
My lectures on all detailed way how it works

38:03.260 --> 38:07.670
out, it’s quite a detailed thing. But in
the first lecture it will be quite boring

38:07.670 --> 38:12.700
for you. So I think I better tell you this
much, that it’s a spontaneous happening

38:12.700 --> 38:19.700
and can happen to all of you.

38:36.590 --> 38:43.590
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

38:53.910 --> 38:54.260
The Sahaja Yogi: Do the first stages in Sahaja
Yoga consist of meditation and how they beneficial

38:54.260 --> 38:54.510
physiological changes?

38:54.260 --> 38:58.270
Shri Mataji: No, it is, you see, we do not
understand the meaning of meditation actually.

38:58.270 --> 39:04.859
You are not to meditate, but you are in meditation
in Sahaja Yoga. You become meditative by temperament.

39:04.859 --> 39:10.280
Now, I would suggest like this that in the
beginning why I said you have to meditate,

39:10.280 --> 39:14.950
because I would like to tell you actually
that word is not so suitable, but I said that

39:14.950 --> 39:21.950
you have to little bit cooperate with Me how
to help your Kundalini to rise. That’s the

39:22.910 --> 39:28.950
process we are going to have in a very simple
words. But I said meditate because that’s

39:28.950 --> 39:35.359
all could make the smaller way of saying things.
But actually in Sahaja Yoga the practice of

39:35.359 --> 39:42.030
Sahaja Yoga is very different from any kind
of meditation, of concentration or anything.

39:42.030 --> 39:48.270
There are very simple ways by which you have
to correct your left or right side and to

39:48.270 --> 39:54.040
be in the center. And then when you are in
the center the growth take place. Is very

39:54.040 --> 40:00.390
simple and luckily we are going to have next
Thursday a very good workshop where they will

40:00.390 --> 40:05.310
tell you all the details how it has to be
done. And they’ll solve all your questions

40:05.310 --> 40:11.450
and all your problems there. And lots of people
are going to be in that place where you’ll

40:11.450 --> 40:18.450
find solutions to all these questions you
ask. Thursday they are going to have a very

40:37.670 --> 40:41.510
good workshop.

40:41.510 --> 40:47.280
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

40:47.280 --> 40:54.280
Shri Mataji: [YES or FIRST], sickness can
be cured if you become Self-Realized. Actually

41:02.590 --> 41:07.369
you don’t go to doctors then anymore, you
become a doctor yourself. So the physical

41:07.369 --> 41:11.790
sufferings can be, this [NOT AUDIBLE – way
?]. Now the collective suffering comes by

41:11.790 --> 41:18.260
the stupidity of humane beings, by the ego
of humane beings, of wrong ideas, you see.

41:18.260 --> 41:24.320
Like a Hindu fighting a Sikh and a Muslim
fighting a Muslim and a Christian fighting

41:24.320 --> 41:31.320
the Jews or all the sorts of nonsense. And
also the capitalist fighting the communists.

41:32.730 --> 41:37.369
Actually I should say I’m a capitalist because
I have certain powers and I’m the greatest

41:37.369 --> 41:42.290
communist because I must distribute it. This
is the real power which has to be distributed.

41:42.290 --> 41:46.590
What is the money power to be distributed?
– Useless thing. Money doesn’t give you

41:46.590 --> 41:52.630
any sense. So is the combination of everything,
the synthesis of everything you’ll find

41:52.630 --> 41:59.630
and that’s how you are surprised that the
sufferings just disappear. Also now you might

42:00.940 --> 42:07.940
say that, “What about the sufferings of
the nature?” People who are Realized souls

42:08.790 --> 42:15.790
never get those suffering things because you
see this full cosmos is within them, they

42:15.830 --> 42:22.830
are looked after. This is at a humane awareness.
But at the spiritual awareness you become

42:24.770 --> 42:31.770
beyond sufferings. And Christ is to be awakened
within you, that’s the points is. Because

42:32.210 --> 42:38.020
Christ is not awakened within you. When the
Christ, you know, in this chakra – this

42:38.020 --> 42:45.020
center is Agya chakra, here – is bestowed
the Deity of Christ. Now here if you can see

42:47.090 --> 42:52.190
in the map there is they have shown on one
side the ego, another side – the superego,

42:52.190 --> 42:59.190
means the conditioning. Now when this chakra
is awakened meaning the Christ within us is

43:00.849 --> 43:07.849
awakened, then He sucks in our karmas. That’s
why they say that He died for our sins. Then

43:09.230 --> 43:16.230
He also sucks in our conditioning, both the
things. He is placed in the middle of the

43:21.190 --> 43:28.190
brain you can say where is the optic chaisma
crossing and He looks after the pituitary

43:29.410 --> 43:36.410
and the pineal body. That’s how He controls
both the things within us and He sucks in.

43:36.710 --> 43:40.030
And when He sucks in there’s an opening
that takes place on our fontanel bone area

43:40.030 --> 43:41.240
and through that then the Kundalini pierces
through.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.270
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

43:42.270 --> 43:49.270
The Sahaja Yogi: How can you keep your Self-Realization
if you are not in touch with the collective?

43:53.300 --> 44:00.300
Shri Mataji: You can not. You have to keep
some connection with the collective. It’s

44:11.660 --> 44:17.930
like say nowadays it’s autumn you have seen.
In autumn what happens? A bark like a cork

44:17.930 --> 44:24.930
develops between the leaves and the tree.
And such a leaf falls off and dies. You have

44:26.650 --> 44:31.260
to be in the collective, you can not keep
your Self-Realization without collectivity.

44:31.260 --> 44:37.890
Is very important to be with the collective.
This is one point people fail, because they

44:37.890 --> 44:42.900
think they’ll lose their individuality.
Is a wrong idea. Actually when the leaf dies

44:42.900 --> 44:48.020
it has no individuality. On the contrary,
when it is on the tree you’ll be surprised,

44:48.020 --> 44:55.020
that one leaf can not tally with another leaf
in the whole world. Such an individual thing

44:56.510 --> 45:03.510
it is. It is I would say unity in diversity,
complete unity in diversity. Because that

45:05.270 --> 45:10.690
is the variety is the one that gives beauty
to this world. Otherwise if we are all sort

45:10.690 --> 45:15.540
of dressed of the same way, walking the same
way, it will be such a boring company.

45:15.540 --> 45:22.540
Is there any question? Such a rapport. It’s
beautiful people today. All right.

45:31.869 --> 45:38.869
So now, as I’ve requested you, those who
would like to go, should go. Because when

45:43.590 --> 45:48.050
we do this we all have to close the eyes and
people are not even willing to do that. So

45:48.050 --> 45:54.330
the thing is that the Divine is not going
to fall at out feet, isn’t it? We have to

45:54.330 --> 45:59.930
be little humble about it. If we don’t have
that humility is better we should try other

45:59.930 --> 46:06.930
methods and then come to Sahaja Yoga. Because
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people,

46:08.609 --> 46:13.450
for people who think knowing of themselves.
Is meant for people who want to get their

46:13.450 --> 46:20.450
Self-Realization.

46:23.840 --> 46:30.840
Now a simple thing we have to do, all of us,
which is also sometimes not liked by people

46:31.710 --> 46:37.460
when I tell them – we have to take out our
shoes. Because this Mother Earth is going

46:37.460 --> 46:43.310
to help us a lot. She’s the one who is giver
of everything. So we have to take out our

46:43.310 --> 46:50.310
shoes and touch the Mother Earth. You can
keep your socks on with your both the feet.

46:59.390 --> 47:06.390
Put both the feet separately because there
are two powers separately on the Mother Earth.

47:33.710 --> 47:39.070
Those who are sitting on the ground are all
right as they are, they need not put their

47:39.070 --> 47:46.070
feet like this, they can sit in a Sahaja asana,
means in a way that is relaxed, not to put

47:48.980 --> 47:54.349
legs on top of another row or anything. Any
stress on your body is not needed. You have

47:54.349 --> 48:01.349
to be comfortable to be straight, sitting
straight, not putting your neck back or forward,

48:02.890 --> 48:09.839
just sitting straight, that’s all.

48:09.839 --> 48:16.839
One promise has to be there in your heart,
that you will after Realization respect your

48:17.320 --> 48:24.320
Realization and grow like a tree and should
not be the like the parable of the seeds that

48:26.030 --> 48:33.030
some seeds fell on a rock and some who sprouted
also got lost. I would request you very-very

48:34.310 --> 48:41.310
earnestly and with a great concern that you
have to look after your Self-Realization and

48:42.839 --> 48:49.839
your growth. As we do not take any money from
anyone, we don’t have very elaborate places

48:51.099 --> 48:58.099
or elaborate centers, so whatever is available
is there for you. But that is God’s place

49:00.080 --> 49:07.080
and you have to come there to get all the
information, the knowledge about the Self.

49:09.400 --> 49:16.400
I hope you will not treat it with just a side
issue, but the main object of your humane

49:22.250 --> 49:29.250
assent. You don’t have to pay for it; you
don’t have to do anything else. Moreover,

49:31.920 --> 49:38.920
we are all the time trying to save time and
that is why the time has to be spent is been

49:42.320 --> 49:45.839
collective and enjoying the joy.

49:45.839 --> 49:51.190
May God bless you all.

49:51.190 --> 49:57.000
So both hands have to be like this, to begin
with. This is because as I told you these

49:57.000 --> 50:03.500
are all sympathetic centers which are to be
enlightened first of all, so the information

50:03.500 --> 50:09.430
goes to the Kundalini that the Kundalini is
to be awakened. This is first thing we have

50:09.430 --> 50:10.810
to do.

50:10.810 --> 50:17.810
Now, secondly, we have to facilitate the movement
of the Kundalini even if she’s awakened.

50:19.740 --> 50:26.740
And for that I will tell you how to put your
hand into various centers to the various centers

50:28.200 --> 50:35.200
so that you can yourself facilitate. I would
like one of you to get up and show this better.

50:35.990 --> 50:37.690
Yeah.

50:37.690 --> 50:44.690
Now Dr. Spiro will show you also and I will
also that first you have to put your hand

50:44.710 --> 50:50.980
to your heart where resides. Now left hand
towards Me and right hand on the heart. Left

50:50.980 --> 50:57.980
hand towards Me. Now to your heart and here
resides the Spirit. We work only on the left

51:01.050 --> 51:07.369
hand side, because that is the side of our
desire and put the left hand like this symbolically

51:07.369 --> 51:14.369
meaning that this is the power of desire and
we want to have our Self-Realization, expression

51:15.780 --> 51:17.339
of that.

51:17.339 --> 51:24.339
Now the second chakra is on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side. This

51:27.460 --> 51:34.460
is the center of your mastery by which the
mastery over this power of love or Divine

51:38.940 --> 51:45.250
vibrations you achieve and manifest through
your being. Is just starts working like through

51:45.250 --> 51:52.250
our eyes we can see the light. In the same
way, once you become the master, you can feel,

51:53.190 --> 51:58.940
you can know everything about yourself and
about others.

51:58.940 --> 52:05.940
Then you have to take down your right hand
to the lower part of your abdomen. This is

52:09.220 --> 52:16.220
the one, which is working out our pure knowledge,
knowledge, which is absolute and pure. This

52:21.530 --> 52:28.460
center is very important and by some unauthorized
people if some people have tamper it we have

52:28.460 --> 52:33.500
to nourish it by putting our right hand towards
it.

52:33.500 --> 52:40.500
Then again we go back into the upper part
of the abdomen.

52:41.220 --> 52:43.750
Then we go back to our heart.

52:43.750 --> 52:50.750
Now here we go back to the left hand side
of our neck, here, like this from front. Many

52:54.500 --> 52:57.369
people tried this side (Shri Mataji pointed
to the back side of Her neck). No. You have

52:57.369 --> 53:04.369
to try from front and then turn your head
to your right, like this. Now this center

53:05.000 --> 53:12.000
catches when we feel guilty and now I find
quite a lot catching in this audience. So

53:14.210 --> 53:21.210
please for the sake of your Self-Realization
forgive yourself, forgive yourself, forgive

53:21.580 --> 53:22.200
yourself.

53:22.200 --> 53:29.200
Now, please now stretch your hand like this
and put it on top of your forehead. This is

53:32.190 --> 53:38.070
the center of forgiveness, – here. And press
it on both the sides, like this.

53:38.070 --> 53:45.070
Now you have to take this hand on the back,
rest your head on that, put the head up. And

53:46.910 --> 53:53.910
then you have to take out your hand again
and stretch it like this. Fully stretched.

53:59.450 --> 54:05.849
The center of your palm is to be placed on
top of the fontanel bone area. You might bend

54:05.849 --> 54:12.849
your head a little, would be better. Just
there, which was a soft bone in your childhood,

54:13.089 --> 54:20.089
and you have to press your scalp and move
it about seven times slowly in a clockwise

54:23.349 --> 54:23.710
manner.

54:23.710 --> 54:30.710
That’s all we have to do. But we must press
it hard and the fingers must be pushed back

54:39.800 --> 54:46.800
nicely so that we can press our palm nicely.
All right. That’s all is to be done. [INAUDIBLE

54:50.089 --> 54:52.450
WORD – Principally ?]

54:52.450 --> 54:58.650
Now we have to close our eyes. Please don’t
open your eyes till I’ll tell you. Because

54:58.650 --> 55:05.650
the attention will be attracted inside and
please you can take out your glasses. The

55:06.630 --> 55:12.109
other day one lady who was quite blind I think
and she started seeing this, I mean, you know,

55:12.109 --> 55:19.109
things happen like that. I would request you
to take out your glasses. It helps you. And

55:19.690 --> 55:26.599
you keep your eyes shut till I’ll tell you,
please don’t open your eyes. It is how you

55:26.599 --> 55:33.599
are going to help yourself and also you will
know how to all the time raise your Kundalini.

55:35.690 --> 55:42.690
It’s very simple method, which I’m telling
you.

55:42.930 --> 55:49.930
Now, please put your left hand towards Me
like this and right hand on your heart. Left

55:50.460 --> 55:57.460
hand towards Me and right hand on your heart.
Here, now close your eyes. In the heart resides

56:01.570 --> 56:06.750
the Spirit. So please ask Me question within
yourself, a very fundamental question, you

56:06.750 --> 56:13.750
can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever
you like, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask

56:15.579 --> 56:22.579
this question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”
Is a very fundamental question here to ask.

56:27.700 --> 56:32.619
Ask this question three times.

56:32.619 --> 56:39.619
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are also your
guide and master. Please put your right hand

56:44.170 --> 56:50.240
in the upper part of your abdomen on the left
hand side, on your stomach on the left hand

56:50.240 --> 56:57.240
side and press it hard and ask a question
here three times again, “Mother, am I my

57:00.410 --> 57:07.410
own master? Mother, am I my own master? Mother,
am I my own master?” Ask this question in

57:14.220 --> 57:16.329
your heart.

57:16.329 --> 57:23.329
Now, we move our right hand, move it down
into the lower part of your abdomen on the

57:32.640 --> 57:39.490
left hand side. Now here, please keep your
eyes shut, please keep your eyes shut and

57:39.490 --> 57:46.490
don’t move too much. Here you have to know
that I respect your freedom and I can not

57:48.619 --> 57:55.619
force you to have the pure knowledge. You
have to say that you want it. So here you

58:01.690 --> 58:08.690
please say, “Mother, please give me pure
knowledge” six times, because this center

58:13.390 --> 58:20.390
has got six petals. So please say six times,
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”.

58:26.900 --> 58:33.900
With this asking the Kundalini starts rising,
because she knows you want it. Now to facilitate

58:38.400 --> 58:45.400
her movement we go back to the higher chakra
and take our hand to the upper part of the

58:47.530 --> 58:54.079
abdomen on the left hand side and press it
hard. Now, with full confidence we have to

58:54.079 --> 59:01.079
say ten times, “Mother, I am my own master”.
Say it with full confidence so the Kundalini

59:04.410 --> 59:11.410
will rise, “Mother, I am my own master”.
Please say it ten times. This will correct

59:18.450 --> 59:25.450
your spiritual domination if somebody has
dominated you spiritually in the sense that

59:26.839 --> 59:33.839
they have misguided you spiritually. “I
am my own master”.

59:34.369 --> 59:41.369
Now, raise your right hand to the heart. Here
resides the Spirit. So with full confidence

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:09.490
say twelve times, “Mother, I am the Spirit”.
Have confidence in yourself.

01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:22.589
We have to know, that the Divine is the ocean
of love and compassion. But above all it is

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:34.329
the ocean of forgiveness and we can not commit
any mistakes, which the Divine can not forgive.

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:45.310
So please forgive yourself, forgive yourself
fully, and raise your right hand in the corner

01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:58.470
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your
head to the right. And here with full confidence

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:06.720
you say sixteen times, “Mother, I am not
guilty at all”. Please say it, very important

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:16.270
and as I said, if you still feel guilty, you
can punish yourself by saying it hundred and

01:01:17.619 --> 01:01:23.960
eight times. You have to be pleasantly placed
towards yourself because you are going to

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:30.960
enter into the Kingdom of God. You have to
love yourself and respect yourself. Sixteen

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:53.280
times please say it.

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:10.589
Now raise your hand and put it on your forehead
across. Put it on your forehead across. This

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:24.650
is the center of forgiveness. So please here
you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”,

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:41.480
from your heart. You might say it is difficult,
but it is a myth. Whether you forgive or you

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:48.460
do not forgive you do not do anything. But
if you do not forgive then you play into wrong

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:55.460
hands. So to get over all the loads you just
say from your heart, “Mother, I forgive

01:02:55.609 --> 01:03:02.609
everyone”. It’s not important how many
times. Press it on both the sides please.

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:13.690
Now take back your hand, and put your hand
on the back of your head, and raise your head

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:30.130
on that. Move your head upward. Now here for
your own satisfaction only, without counting

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:40.560
any mistakes or guilt you can say, “Oh,
Divine, if I have made any mistakes, please

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:50.130
forgive me”. For your own satisfaction,
don’t feel guilty about it. In a very pleasant

01:03:57.329 --> 01:03:58.410
manner.

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:05.410
Now stretch your hand fully, push back your
fingers, and put the center of your palm on

01:04:13.369 --> 01:04:20.369
top of the fontanel bone area, and now start
moving it very slowly, very slowly clockwise

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:30.690
the scalp. Press it hard, push back your fingers.
Seven times. At this point I must say that

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:38.060
I can not force again the Self-Realization
upon you. I respect your freedom. You have

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:44.369
to ask for it. So please say seven times,
“Mother, please give me my Realization,

01:04:44.369 --> 01:04:48.240
give me my Self-Realization”. Or, “May
I have my Self-Realization”. (Shri Mataji

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.240
is blowing in the microphone 7 times.)

01:05:55.130 --> 01:06:02.130
Now please take down your hands. Please open
your eyes very slowly. Now watch Me without

01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:18.089
thinking. Let’s see if you can do it. Without
thinking. Just watch Me without thinking.

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:27.589
Please put your right hand towards Me, right
hand towards Me like this. And the left hand

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:36.460
above your head and bend your head and try
to see if you are feeling any cool breeze

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:43.920
from here. Bend your head, bend, bend it.
Little higher. Some people get it very high,

01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:56.790
very high they get it, some of them. Move
it. And now put the left hand towards Me like

01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:10.790
this, again bend your head and see if you
are getting a cool breeze in your head.

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:26.849
Now put your right hand towards Me again,
bend your head and see for yourself again

01:07:28.819 --> 01:07:35.819
if there’s a cool breeze.

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:43.319
Now raise both your hands towards the sky
and push back your head and ask a question

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:58.220
three times, “Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the Brahma

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:05.720
Shakti? Mother, is this the All Pervading
Power of God’s Love?” Just ask the question.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Now put down your hands. Now please put your
hands like this. You’ll feel very relaxed

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:34.029
and peaceful. In the hands also you’ll feel
little cool breeze coming. Some people might

01:08:34.029 --> 01:08:41.029
feel in one hand, might feel in another hand.
Some of them do feel that way.

01:08:43.369 --> 01:08:50.369
All those who are feeling the cool breeze
on top of their heads or on their fingertips,

01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:07.429
please raise both your hands. Both hands to
be raised those who are feeling it. Just imagine!

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:25.309
Most of them have felt it. Imagine. Hardly
very few haven’t felt. It’s very easy

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:33.319
for them also to feel it and if they want
they can come up to the stage and people can

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:41.380
look after them. They can feel it today, they
should and they will work out their Kundalini.

01:09:42.659 --> 01:09:49.659
Maybe little help is needed and it’s very
kind of you, all of you to have received your

01:09:51.929 --> 01:09:58.929
Realization. I bow to all of you. I bow to
all of you and I beg of you as a Mother that

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:05.739
please look after your Self-Realization, do
not waste it. Those who haven’t got it should

01:10:05.739 --> 01:10:12.739
not feel in any way disturbed or upset, it’s
very simple. Maybe the little time was needed

01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:20.650
more or whatever it is. I would request them
to come on the stage for five minutes or ten

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:25.010
minutes and they might get their Realization
very well.

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:27.280
May God bless you.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:34.280
Also if you want to come and meet Me you can
come on the stage, I would like to talk to

01:10:44.829 --> 01:10:51.829
you. So many! Now what do you want? The England,
the whole England! Those who want to be should

01:10:53.219 --> 01:10:55.980
come, one by one, please.
