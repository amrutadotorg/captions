00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:10.220
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:16.230
we have gathered here

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:23.590
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.690
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.830
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.110
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.820
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:54.650
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.720
and that you can do this Puja performed.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.870
It's your right.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.890
You are chosen for this.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:12.040
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.510
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:22.060
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:33.920
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.740
These are specially created cells

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.860
through the working of the Swadishthana.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.260
Passing through all the chakras,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.560
when they arrive at Sahasrara

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.990
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:19.160
without getting involved into

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.900
other elements in the body.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.330
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:40.550
are not to be involved with the other cells -

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.760
human beings,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.320
of the body of this universe.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:58.220
The first thing that happens

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.430
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.490
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.000
So, many things he transcends:

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.980
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.420
Time is his slave.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.540
If you have to go somewhere

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:29.850
then suddenly you discover

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:37.660
that everything is working about the same time

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.540
when you are able to do it.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:50.380
Like you are, say, to catch a train

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.240
and you arrive late at the station,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.190
you find the train is late for you.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.170
Things work out in such a way that you feel

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:13.860
they are all active for your complete convenience.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.570
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.740
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:28.770
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.690
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.560
you just don't do it.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.770
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.570
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.330
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:53.160
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

00:11:53.370 --> 00:12:00.880
either with lust,
greed, at something,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.680
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:17.310
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:22.230
means the attention loses its dharma.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:31.440
The dharma of the attention are such that

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.110
we have to put

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:42.690
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.710
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:57.260
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.350
and when they attack us,

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.950
then

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:13.770
we have to have some measures to control it.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.940
So we build up our dharmas,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.970
our rules and regulation,

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.420
and control them, the dharmas,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.490
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.890
This is the greatness of human beings,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:42.740
that they have made their own dharmas

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.910
established on top of the lower dharmas.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.280
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.620
It has to be in four valences;

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.400
it acts according to the four valences,

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.650
it cannot make it six.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:04.480
But human beings can make

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.950
those valences established which are supposed to be

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.920
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:18.270
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.390
means, you don't have need,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.680
there’s no need,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.320
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.650
You don't have to discipline,

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.180
but you get disciplined automatically.

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.830
That is the first sign of a person

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.420
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.310
Attention doesn't get attached

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.930
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:58.730
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.640
So you become ‘kalateet’.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.250
You become ‘dharmateet’.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.530
You become ‘gunateet’.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.460
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.980
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:27.290
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.140
of your attention.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:36.830
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:42.010
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:51.090
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.420
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.390
which is ‘satvika’.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.610
Where a person tries to control

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:11.610
all his enemies of lust, anger,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:18.800
pride, vanity, attachments

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.780
and greed.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.640
All these restrictions

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.760
on the attention get lost

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.280
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:45.810
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:55.740
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.400
and you become ‘satgunis’-

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.250
means virtuous,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:11.070
but not by discipline,

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:14.760
but spontaneously.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.330
You become righteous spontaneously.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.920
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.400
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:34.080
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.340
in the sense, in front of the temples.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.480
According to laws, we should not have temper,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:51.050
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.470
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:18:02.030
which is not to be analyzed,

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:06.810
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.590
the killing of the rakshasas,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.000
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.170
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.160
they are all dead already.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.250
They all get explained because you go beyond.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.960
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.990
Only the one who can control is beyond.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.070
The one who is in it cannot control it.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:48.620
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:55.480
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.570
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:13.900
But, when it comes to the knowledge

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.960
about such a person, you cannot think,

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:26.560
because such a person is beyond thinking.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.560
You cannot describe

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.440
because such a person cannot describe.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.900
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.340
take the poison?

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.700
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.150
That's beyond human comprehension.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.100
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.170
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.830
Your certificates come from God Almighty

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.390
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:23.410
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.090
So you reach a state

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.200
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.510
means ‘without’,

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.880
without.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:52.280
So such a person

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.870
is without thought; he doesn't think.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.730
Such a person is without greed,

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.240
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:21.470
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:30.980
out of which nothing is left out.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.210
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.150
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:43.950
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.880
because it reaches a point all the time

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.700
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.600
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.760
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:11.480
Vacuum of all the negative,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.350
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.010
Such a person is eternal being.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.810
Nobody can kill,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:39.880
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.850
The anger

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:52.920
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.050
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:09.140
He is not elated by praises

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:15.190
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:19.470
the boons of the ego.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:37.640
So the third state where he reaches,

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.540
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.630
Nihi.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.750
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:59.680
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.570
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.180
But the word is 'Nihi'.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.930
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.050
‘nih’ -

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:22.370
that means

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.230
‘sheer’.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:36.940
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:46.640
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:54.080
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:07.280
Like when you say

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:15.320
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.930
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:23.420
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.250
But this word is used,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:33.590
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:42.560
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:48.720
without or devoid of.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:54.430
The another form is:

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.080
the only - absolute;

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.910
the absolute.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.740
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.610
nothing but joy.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.790
It's complete freedom.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:21.120
So you have all kinds of joys,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:27.550
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.570
the joy of the Spirit.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:39.740
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.980
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.950
where you have the joy of the play.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.180
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.050
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.280
means, sheer absolute joy.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.700
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.180
it means absolute.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.360
So when you put such an adjective before

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.250
anything else it becomes absolute.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:34.350
Thus you become absolute.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:43.270
And when you are at that state of absolute

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:49.680
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.350
But let us see what is absolute.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.860
That means it is not relative;

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.410
it has no relative qualities.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:17.760
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.680
it cannot be compared.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.530
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.160
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.890
anything else through which we can comprehend;

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.770
it is absolute.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:50.010
Whatever way you try to know it

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.420
you go away from absolute.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:05.330
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:21.060
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.620
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.960
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.610
means the anand of the body,

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:44.310
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.140
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.730
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.080
But the state has now

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.270
to be established within us is of Niranand.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:11.000
Then what is the question of fear?

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.690
What is the question of talking about it?

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.770
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.460
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.190
There are no words for absolute to describe.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.010
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.580
what remains is absolute.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.360
So you reach the state of absolute.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.900
And that is the state

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:56.050
a complete communication is established

00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:00.990
and in that communication you have nobody else

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.460
but the absolute within you.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.280
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.650
That is the level to which you should aspire.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.430
That should be the ascent,

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:32.160
which should be established within ourselves.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.710
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:39.330
we don't have to do anything drastic.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:44.990
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.120
the only, ‘kevalam’.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.210
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:08.370
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:14.560
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.900
Just by surrendering you become.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.400
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:32.770
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.460
It is absolute love,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:41.160
it is absolute compassion;

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.190
it is absolute power.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.610
The words stop,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:05.190
the description stops;

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:10.180
you just become the absolute

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:17.220
and feel your absoluteness through it

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.810
with that oneness.

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:27.720
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.490
There’s no company needed.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:38.890
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:51.360
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:57.900
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.600
May God bless you.
