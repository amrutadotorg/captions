WEBVTT

06:57.200 --> 07:10.220
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

07:10.430 --> 07:16.230
we have gathered here

07:16.430 --> 07:23.590
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.690
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

07:32.890 --> 07:37.830
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

07:38.030 --> 07:43.110
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

07:43.310 --> 07:47.820
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

07:48.020 --> 07:54.650
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

07:54.850 --> 08:00.720
and that you can do this Puja performed.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.870
It's your right.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.890
You are chosen for this.

08:08.350 --> 08:12.040
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

08:12.240 --> 08:14.510
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

08:14.710 --> 08:22.060
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

08:25.080 --> 08:33.920
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

08:44.260 --> 08:49.740
These are specially created cells

08:49.940 --> 08:53.860
through the working of the Swadishthana.

08:54.190 --> 08:58.260
Passing through all the chakras,

08:58.460 --> 09:01.560
when they arrive at Sahasrara

09:01.760 --> 09:09.990
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

09:10.190 --> 09:19.160
without getting involved into

09:19.360 --> 09:23.900
other elements in the body.

09:27.360 --> 09:33.330
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

09:33.540 --> 09:40.550
are not to be involved with the other cells -

09:40.750 --> 09:44.760
human beings,

09:44.960 --> 09:49.320
of the body of this universe.

09:53.890 --> 09:58.220
The first thing that happens

09:58.420 --> 10:02.430
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

10:02.630 --> 10:07.490
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

10:08.030 --> 10:12.000
So, many things he transcends:

10:12.210 --> 10:15.980
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.420
Time is his slave.

10:20.180 --> 10:23.540
If you have to go somewhere

10:23.740 --> 10:29.850
then suddenly you discover

10:30.050 --> 10:37.660
that everything is working about the same time

10:37.870 --> 10:41.540
when you are able to do it.

10:41.970 --> 10:50.380
Like you are, say, to catch a train

10:50.580 --> 10:54.240
and you arrive late at the station,

10:54.440 --> 10:59.190
you find the train is late for you.

11:01.120 --> 11:06.170
Things work out in such a way that you feel

11:06.370 --> 11:13.860
they are all active for your complete convenience.

11:14.060 --> 11:18.570
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

11:18.850 --> 11:22.740
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

11:22.950 --> 11:28.770
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

11:28.970 --> 11:31.690
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

11:31.890 --> 11:33.560
you just don't do it.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.770
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.570
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

11:44.770 --> 11:47.330
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

11:47.530 --> 11:53.160
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

11:53.370 --> 12:00.880
either with lust,
greed, at something,

12:01.080 --> 12:04.680
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

12:04.880 --> 12:17.310
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

12:17.510 --> 12:22.230
means the attention loses its dharma.

12:23.530 --> 12:31.440
The dharma of the attention are such that

12:31.640 --> 12:37.110
we have to put

12:37.310 --> 12:42.690
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

12:43.940 --> 12:49.710
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

12:50.040 --> 12:57.260
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

12:57.460 --> 13:02.350
and when they attack us,

13:02.550 --> 13:07.950
then

13:08.150 --> 13:13.770
we have to have some measures to control it.

13:13.970 --> 13:18.940
So we build up our dharmas,

13:19.140 --> 13:22.970
our rules and regulation,

13:23.170 --> 13:26.420
and control them, the dharmas,

13:26.620 --> 13:31.490
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

13:32.130 --> 13:35.890
This is the greatness of human beings,

13:36.090 --> 13:42.740
that they have made their own dharmas

13:42.940 --> 13:45.910
established on top of the lower dharmas.

13:46.110 --> 13:50.280
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.620
It has to be in four valences;

13:52.820 --> 13:55.400
it acts according to the four valences,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.650
it cannot make it six.

13:58.850 --> 14:04.480
But human beings can make

14:04.680 --> 14:07.950
those valences established which are supposed to be

14:08.150 --> 14:12.920
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

14:13.250 --> 14:18.270
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

14:18.470 --> 14:21.390
means, you don't have need,

14:21.590 --> 14:24.680
there’s no need,

14:24.880 --> 14:29.320
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.650
You don't have to discipline,

14:31.850 --> 14:35.180
but you get disciplined automatically.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.830
That is the first sign of a person

14:39.030 --> 14:44.420
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.310
Attention doesn't get attached

14:47.510 --> 14:52.930
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

14:53.130 --> 14:58.730
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.640
So you become ‘kalateet’.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.250
You become ‘dharmateet’.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.530
You become ‘gunateet’.

15:11.930 --> 15:16.460
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

15:16.660 --> 15:20.980
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

15:21.180 --> 15:27.290
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

15:27.490 --> 15:30.140
of your attention.

15:30.340 --> 15:36.830
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

15:37.030 --> 15:42.010
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

15:42.840 --> 15:51.090
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

15:51.300 --> 15:56.420
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

15:56.620 --> 15:59.390
which is ‘satvika’.

15:59.710 --> 16:04.610
Where a person tries to control

16:04.810 --> 16:11.610
all his enemies of lust, anger,

16:11.810 --> 16:18.800
pride, vanity, attachments

16:19.000 --> 16:21.780
and greed.

16:22.800 --> 16:29.640
All these restrictions

16:29.840 --> 16:33.760
on the attention get lost

16:33.960 --> 16:40.280
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

16:40.480 --> 16:45.810
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

16:48.150 --> 16:55.740
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

16:55.940 --> 17:00.400
and you become ‘satgunis’-

17:00.600 --> 17:04.250
means virtuous,

17:04.460 --> 17:11.070
but not by discipline,

17:11.270 --> 17:14.760
but spontaneously.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.330
You become righteous spontaneously.

17:18.530 --> 17:21.920
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

17:22.120 --> 17:26.400
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

17:26.600 --> 17:34.080
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

17:34.280 --> 17:38.340
in the sense, in front of the temples.

17:40.250 --> 17:44.480
According to laws, we should not have temper,

17:44.680 --> 17:51.050
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

17:51.250 --> 17:55.470
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

17:55.670 --> 18:02.030
which is not to be analyzed,

18:02.230 --> 18:06.810
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

18:07.010 --> 18:11.590
the killing of the rakshasas,

18:11.790 --> 18:15.000
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

18:15.200 --> 18:19.170
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

18:19.370 --> 18:23.160
they are all dead already.

18:25.530 --> 18:29.250
They all get explained because you go beyond.

18:29.450 --> 18:33.960
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.990
Only the one who can control is beyond.

18:38.190 --> 18:42.070
The one who is in it cannot control it.

18:42.470 --> 18:48.620
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

18:48.820 --> 18:55.480
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.570
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

19:04.830 --> 19:13.900
But, when it comes to the knowledge

19:14.100 --> 19:18.960
about such a person, you cannot think,

19:19.160 --> 19:26.560
because such a person is beyond thinking.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.560
You cannot describe

19:29.760 --> 19:34.440
because such a person cannot describe.

19:35.140 --> 19:40.900
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

19:41.100 --> 19:45.340
take the poison?

19:48.320 --> 19:52.700
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

19:54.670 --> 19:59.150
That's beyond human comprehension.

20:00.140 --> 20:03.100
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

20:03.300 --> 20:07.170
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

20:07.370 --> 20:11.830
Your certificates come from God Almighty

20:12.040 --> 20:17.390
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

20:17.590 --> 20:23.410
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

20:30.540 --> 20:33.090
So you reach a state

20:33.290 --> 20:36.200
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

20:36.410 --> 20:39.510
means ‘without’,

20:42.440 --> 20:44.880
without.

20:47.610 --> 20:52.280
So such a person

20:52.480 --> 20:56.870
is without thought; he doesn't think.

21:03.770 --> 21:07.730
Such a person is without greed,

21:07.930 --> 21:13.240
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

21:17.310 --> 21:21.470
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

21:21.670 --> 21:30.980
out of which nothing is left out.

21:31.180 --> 21:35.210
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

21:35.410 --> 21:39.150
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

21:39.350 --> 21:43.950
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

21:44.150 --> 21:47.880
because it reaches a point all the time

21:48.080 --> 21:52.700
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

21:52.900 --> 21:56.600
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

21:57.020 --> 22:02.760
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

22:05.090 --> 22:11.480
Vacuum of all the negative,

22:11.680 --> 22:18.350
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

22:24.950 --> 22:29.010
Such a person is eternal being.

22:29.230 --> 22:33.810
Nobody can kill,

22:34.010 --> 22:39.880
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

22:41.020 --> 22:46.850
The anger

22:47.050 --> 22:52.920
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

22:53.120 --> 22:57.050
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

22:57.250 --> 23:09.140
He is not elated by praises

23:09.340 --> 23:15.190
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

23:15.390 --> 23:19.470
the boons of the ego.

23:31.310 --> 23:37.640
So the third state where he reaches,

23:37.840 --> 23:43.540
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

23:43.750 --> 23:45.630
Nihi.

23:48.480 --> 23:53.750
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

23:53.950 --> 23:59.680
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

23:59.880 --> 24:03.570
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.180
But the word is 'Nihi'.

24:07.380 --> 24:10.930
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

24:13.860 --> 24:16.050
‘nih’ -

24:16.250 --> 24:22.370
that means

24:22.570 --> 24:25.230
‘sheer’.

24:29.300 --> 24:36.940
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

24:40.050 --> 24:46.640
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

24:46.840 --> 24:54.080
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

25:00.250 --> 25:07.280
Like when you say

25:07.480 --> 25:15.320
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

25:15.520 --> 25:17.930
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

25:18.140 --> 25:23.420
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

25:26.180 --> 25:30.250
But this word is used,

25:30.450 --> 25:33.590
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

25:33.790 --> 25:42.560
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

25:42.760 --> 25:48.720
without or devoid of.

25:48.930 --> 25:54.430
The another form is:

25:54.640 --> 25:58.080
the only - absolute;

26:01.350 --> 26:03.910
the absolute.

26:05.430 --> 26:10.740
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

26:10.940 --> 26:13.610
nothing but joy.

26:13.810 --> 26:16.790
It's complete freedom.

26:17.210 --> 26:21.120
So you have all kinds of joys,

26:21.320 --> 26:27.550
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

26:27.750 --> 26:31.570
the joy of the Spirit.

26:33.030 --> 26:39.740
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

26:40.990 --> 26:43.980
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

26:44.180 --> 26:48.950
where you have the joy of the play.

26:52.690 --> 26:56.180
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

26:56.380 --> 26:59.050
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

26:59.250 --> 27:03.280
means, sheer absolute joy.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.700
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

27:08.900 --> 27:12.180
it means absolute.

27:12.910 --> 27:15.360
So when you put such an adjective before

27:15.560 --> 27:19.250
anything else it becomes absolute.

27:30.670 --> 27:34.350
Thus you become absolute.

27:37.540 --> 27:43.270
And when you are at that state of absolute

27:43.470 --> 27:49.680
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

27:56.320 --> 28:00.350
But let us see what is absolute.

28:05.780 --> 28:09.860
That means it is not relative;

28:10.060 --> 28:12.410
it has no relative qualities.

28:12.610 --> 28:17.760
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

28:17.970 --> 28:20.680
it cannot be compared.

28:21.870 --> 28:26.530
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

28:29.660 --> 28:33.160
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

28:33.360 --> 28:36.890
anything else through which we can comprehend;

28:37.090 --> 28:39.770
it is absolute.

28:44.090 --> 28:50.010
Whatever way you try to know it

28:50.210 --> 28:54.420
you go away from absolute.

28:57.840 --> 29:05.330
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

29:15.610 --> 29:21.060
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

29:23.120 --> 29:26.620
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

29:26.820 --> 29:30.960
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

29:31.160 --> 29:35.610
means the anand of the body,

29:37.010 --> 29:44.310
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.140
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

29:51.340 --> 29:55.730
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

29:57.670 --> 30:01.080
But the state has now

30:01.280 --> 30:05.270
to be established within us is of Niranand.

30:06.540 --> 30:11.000
Then what is the question of fear?

30:13.770 --> 30:16.690
What is the question of talking about it?

30:16.890 --> 30:21.770
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

30:21.970 --> 30:26.460
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

30:28.100 --> 30:31.190
There are no words for absolute to describe.

30:31.390 --> 30:34.010
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

30:34.210 --> 30:37.580
what remains is absolute.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.360
So you reach the state of absolute.

30:48.450 --> 30:50.900
And that is the state

30:51.100 --> 30:56.050
a complete communication is established

30:56.250 --> 31:00.990
and in that communication you have nobody else

31:01.190 --> 31:04.460
but the absolute within you.

31:11.230 --> 31:15.280
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

31:16.150 --> 31:20.650
That is the level to which you should aspire.

31:22.160 --> 31:27.430
That should be the ascent,

31:27.630 --> 31:32.160
which should be established within ourselves.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.710
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

31:35.910 --> 31:39.330
we don't have to do anything drastic.

31:39.530 --> 31:44.990
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

31:45.190 --> 31:49.120
the only, ‘kevalam’.

31:53.920 --> 31:59.210
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

32:01.470 --> 32:08.370
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

32:08.570 --> 32:14.560
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

32:15.170 --> 32:19.900
Just by surrendering you become.

32:21.460 --> 32:25.400
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

32:25.600 --> 32:32.770
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

32:34.050 --> 32:37.460
It is absolute love,

32:37.660 --> 32:41.160
it is absolute compassion;

32:41.360 --> 32:45.190
it is absolute power.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.610
The words stop,

33:00.810 --> 33:05.190
the description stops;

33:07.130 --> 33:10.180
you just become the absolute

33:10.380 --> 33:17.220
and feel your absoluteness through it

33:17.420 --> 33:20.810
with that oneness.

33:22.710 --> 33:27.720
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

33:29.350 --> 33:32.490
There’s no company needed.

33:32.690 --> 33:38.890
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

33:44.820 --> 33:51.360
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

33:51.570 --> 33:57.900
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.600
May God bless you.
