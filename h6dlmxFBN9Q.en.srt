1
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,070
This will be the fifth puja in Australia,
and I thought that this is the land of Ganesha,

2
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,640
we should have the Ganesha Puja. Is very important
also, very helpful. We all should have Ganesha

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Puja, it’s very important. And so today
there will be Shri Ganesha Puja. Have you

4
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,200
got the hundred and eight names of Shri Ganesha?

5
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,780
So we have now requested John Fisher to be
your leader in Canberra. And he has agreed.

6
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,360
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

7
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:09,889
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra. If you read the newspaper, just on

8
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,700
the first page you find people going amok
as far as their moral sense is concerned,

9
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,730
absolutely I mean, to us it is something so
shocking, and perhaps I think people are possessed

10
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:45,090
on their Mooladhara Chakra. The way they behave
one feels that there’s something gone wrong

11
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:54,130
with them completely and they have no control
over themselves; and just like mad people

12
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:02,489
they are behaving. And all these problems
that are coming, of these perversions, are

13
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,489
due to this kind of a possession on the Mooladhara
Chakra. One has to be very, very careful and

14
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:19,829
respectful about it. I have already told so
many things how to keep it clean, how to respect

15
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,440
it and how to behave yourself.

16
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,440
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created 
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling
into hell. But actually when we insult Him

17
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,800
and we do not care for Him, He just sleeps
off. When that happens, any kind of a possession

18
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:04,229
can come and can really make people mad. When
you come from India to these places you are

19
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,840
really surprised and shocked. What is wrong
with these people, how can they be behaving

20
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,840
in this manner? How can they go all out to
ruin themselves like this? And how is it they

21
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,780
do not understand the importance of morality
when they are following Christ? The Christians,

22
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:40,290
I think, are the worst as far as morality
is concerned. They have no moral values left

23
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:47,370
in them. It’s such a sad thing that the
number of people killed by Christians is also

24
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,380
the maximum. Sometimes I think these people
who were killed everywhere might have possessed

25
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:02,230
the Christians this way, that they are just
going amok and behaving in this manner, destroying

26
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,100
themselves.

27
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:10,100
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom. And that wisdom gives

28
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,120
us the sense how to behave, gives us the balance,
and gives us the sense how to behave towards

29
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:29,750
ourselves, how to preserve yourself, how to
respect yourself. But if Ganesha is not at

30
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,060
all there to watch you, might be from hell
some horrible hellish bhoots are coming out,

31
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,820
or I don’t know, I cannot explain this kind
of a thing. But the other way round, I’ll

32
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,090
tell you, in India, is specially with women,
they are extremely particular about their

33
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,920
chastity, extremely particular.

34
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman. And one Muslim

35
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:18,660
aggressor who became sultan heard about her
beauty. So he wanted to see her. So she refused,

36
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:28,170
“I don’t want to see him.” Even seeing
a woman like that: those bad eyes, are bad;

37
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,230
seeing a woman also, are bad.

38
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:40,560
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

39
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,520
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

40
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,030
fall on me directly.” She agreed to that.
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that

41
00:07:53,030 --> 00:08:00,030
it was even more beautiful than he had thought
her to be. So now he wanted to have her. So

42
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,570
physical, so superficial.

43
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:12,060
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

44
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,690
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

45
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,139
or not.” So everybody said, “Nothing doing.
We are not going to surrender.” Because

46
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:29,139
the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

47
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:39,570
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this. They could not bear the idea.

48
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:47,389
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.” So they

49
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,839
sent a word, “All right, we are all coming
and the queen is coming too.” And they sent

50
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,950
hundred palanquins. We use palanquins for
ladies in India, covered. And inside every

51
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,950
palanquin there was one warrior sitting with
all the weapons. And there were four carrying

52
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:12,959
the palanquin, and all these four were also
warriors. So thus they have about five hundred

53
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,959
warriors. It was a small kingdom. So when
they went down, these people were very happy.

54
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:28,540
“The queen is coming.” and they were all
getting drunk and celebrating it. “The queen

55
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,879
is coming. Queen is coming.” So they were
half drunk also.

56
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:38,290
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

57
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:44,980
that we have won. But if you do not see any
thing like that, then be sure that we have

58
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,550
lost the war.”

59
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,910
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

60
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,110
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

61
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:04,209
king came out and they all fought those people.
But they were only five hundred so they could

62
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:10,069
not be saved, and these people had better
weapons, so they were killed. They did not

63
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:16,420
lit the fire. Now the women knew that all
of them will be coming. Now they were very

64
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,040
rich sultans, very rich Muslims, and things
like that. But they thought that now their

65
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,809
chastity is in danger, so there was a big
platform and they made a big pyre on that.

66
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:34,809
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

67
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,040
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity. And if

68
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:53,259
they do not have the great sense of chastity,
then they develop all kinds of funny ideas

69
00:10:54,449 --> 00:11:00,660
and mentally they become very imbalanced.
And the children that they have, also become

70
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,660
very funny and you have all these problems
of perverted relations, incest relations.

71
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:14,529
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

72
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:21,529
relationship.
It’s hell that we have created. In hell

73
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:31,459
what else is going to be? Same thing. There’s
no sanity about it, there’s no wisdom about

74
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,009
it.

75
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:43,009
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis. Men and women,

76
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:53,119
all of them, have to go hand in hand, because
the first quality I told is wisdom, but the

77
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,300
essence of Mooladhara is innocence. They are
made of innocence. The power of Ganesha is

78
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,970
innocence. And innocence comes when you do
not destroy it. Actually a child is born innocent,

79
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:19,100
but if the mother is like that, immediately
the child takes over and if the father is

80
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:26,550
like that the son takes over. But later on
it has effect, whether it’s mother or father.

81
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:34,009
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down. You can see it so clearly.

82
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,860
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

83
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:52,170
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

84
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:59,429
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence. And they

85
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,329
have built the whole thing in such a manner
that these things never enter into our head.

86
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:13,720
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”. These good conditionings

87
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,649
are surrounding us so much that this never
enters into our head, all these kind of things

88
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,209
that people are doing here, are mad. When
it doesn’t enter into your head, we can

89
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:32,209
say that we just do not allow these possessions
to come in. Because if you make preparation

90
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:45,629
in a way for these possessions to come in,
then the possessions will be there. Like the

91
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,350
way people dress up nowadays, you see, they
look like really witches or bhoots, absolutely.

92
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,509
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

93
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:57,889
someone like us. Let’s go enter them.”

94
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:04,569
Also Agnya is not to be covered. I have told
a hundred times, please don’t cover your

95
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:11,100
Agnya, please clear it down. Don’t cover
your Agnya. If you cover your Agnya, then

96
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,100
you cannot be protected. They enter into your
Agnya and from Agnya they can go up to your

97
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Mooladhara. So you are living in atmosphere
which is very dangerous for saints to live.

98
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,660
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya. If they could say that

99
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,660
to Indians, I don’t know what should I say
to people who live in such horrible circumstance,

100
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,949
absolutely horrible. I mean, you think about
it, how terrible it is, and how many problems

101
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:53,949
it gives us; how many people are ruined, how
many children are ruined, how we go amok.

102
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,559
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

103
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:12,399
is innate within us. It’s not imposed on
us, it is innate. A little girl if you see,

104
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:21,589
she’s shy, she knows how to protect herself.
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to

105
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:30,649
protect themselves, but that innate innocence
we try to flout, because ego is there. “What’s

106
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:41,899
wrong?” You tell them anything, “What’s
wrong?” And you do not know how devastating

107
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:48,899
it is. In London I know of so many parents
telling Me that their children are already

108
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:56,179
squatting, they have got already children.
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen

109
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:03,179
they have got children. And this is so widespread,
and so shamelessly they discuss. I mean, in

110
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:15,230
the newspaper if you read, I mean you can’t
imagine why to write all these things in such

111
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:21,699
details in the newspaper. There’s no need
to write each and every thing in the newspaper.

112
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:28,699
But basically we are good people. God has
created us good human beings. We are beautiful

113
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:41,009
people, but this ego and this kind of a stupid
idea that, “What’s wrong?” in doing

114
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:51,649
anything, coming from ego; people have gone
amok, and when you go amok you get caught

115
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,049
up by these bhoots, and then once you are
caught up by these bhoots, you start behaving

116
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:04,049
in a manner that no one can explain. “Why
they behave like this?” I just don’t understand.

117
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:13,199
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

118
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,910
all these jattas, as we call them. So I asked
him, “Why do you dress up like this? You

119
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,870
look like a primitive man.”

120
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,400
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

121
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,250
I said, “You cannot. Your brain is modern.
By just making such hair, are you going to

122
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,170
become primitive? You cannot become primitive.”

123
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:39,170
But just imagine, all these external things
they do. For what? To have an identity. Now

124
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:47,170
this idea of identity is also is a sign that
you do not have your maryadas. You can do

125
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,200
anything. You can become a punk and all kinds
of things you do. I mean, there are no maryadas.

126
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:00,960
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately

127
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,960
within us. Even a prostitute in India, if
she has to take to that profession because

128
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,500
she’s forced into it, maybe she’s been
brought from somewhere or maybe that out of

129
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,500
her big problems she might have been a prostitute;
she will see that her child is saved. She

130
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,350
knows that it’s wrong. But here it is so
bad that we do not know also that it is wrong.

131
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:33,320
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

132
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,430
water and you know that you are going to be
killed. Still you are enjoying, “Very nice,

133
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:45,780
I am going to be killed.” This is the situation
of the wisdom. This is really shocking.

134
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,700
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

135
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,270
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha. For that the best is

136
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:05,270
to meditate. Put yourself on some nice turf,
grass. Sit on that. Put your left hand with

137
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,400
the light, and right hand on the Mother Earth,
and say Atharva Sheersha. If you can remember

138
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,460
it by heart, it’s a very good thing. Otherwise,
you can keep the book and read it, or say

139
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,870
Ganesha’s mantra to begin with. It’s going
to help you very much. It’s going to help

140
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:36,380
you, your eyes, it’s going to your whole
thing, is going to be very nice. And also

141
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:43,380
with this kind of a mad Mooladhara, a woman
can become extremely aggressive with her husband.

142
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,360
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

143
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,990
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel. I mean, I never used to think

144
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:00,990
women could be cruel, really. I mean they
could be sly, they could be sort of, doing

145
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:09,310
some scandal-mongering or some sort of stupid
things like that. But that a woman should

146
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,280
be a cruel woman… when I first read the
history of England I was surprised that there

147
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,040
were some queens who were very cruel, and
also that there were seven queens who were

148
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:30,040
killed. In India if a king kills even one
queen, he’ll be ousted completely from the

149
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:37,930
whole country.

150
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:48,570
So it’s not a something very simple thing.
It’s very serious. For Sahaja yogis very,

151
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:42,750
very serious. They have to revive their innocence.
They have to revive their maryadas. They have

152
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:56,910
to delimit themselves. It’s very important.
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some

153
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:04,400
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach
the heights? You have to put them into some

154
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,460
bags, some maryadas. Only by maryadas you
can rise. Of course the kundalini will help.

155
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,990
Of course Ganesha will help also. But we should
also try to watch ourselves. There should

156
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:30,150
be introspection, “Are we still in the same
category?” I have told many people that

157
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,360
it is better you walk with your eyes towards
the grass, at only at three feet, because

158
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:45,350
at three feet you can only see children, flowers
and grounds, not higher than that. Nothing

159
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:52,350
very beautiful is beyond that I think. Or
raise much higher, so that you just see above

160
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:59,440
the heads of people, nothing in between. And
our whole style, lifestyle is so funny; I

161
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,360
mean, I just don’t know how to explain it,
but is accepted.

162
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:19,360
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

163
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,950
one sin, so I must tell you.”

164
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:28,530
I said, “What?” “In my family nobody
takes beer, but I am taking beer sometimes.”

165
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:35,530
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say. Very seriously he said, “You

166
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:43,520
are Mother, so I must confess to You, but
now I will never touch beer.” Imagine. Very

167
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,480
seriously he was talking, and another fellow
came, he has told Me.

168
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,730
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing. What is it? You are all

169
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,640
making money?”

170
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,210
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

171
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,220
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

172
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,810
Why not?”

173
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:12,800
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…” With very great hesitation, he said

174
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,340
that, “You see, mostly it is not advertised
in Indian papers, and we Indians think that

175
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,720
we are rather of a different species, you
see, how are we going to fit in with these

176
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:28,370
people because, you see, their ideas are so
different, ours are so different, and how

177
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,080
are we going to fit in with them? It’s very
difficult. But this time I saw some Indians

178
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,920
also and some Indian musicians singing, so
it seems that we can fit into them.”

179
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,230
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them. It’s easy. They

180
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,550
are your style only.”

181
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,180
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

182
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,500
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything. India is like that, you

183
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,570
see. They think you are of a different bottle
and they are of a different bottle. So you

184
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,120
are like that and they are like that. They
cannot be like you and you cannot be like

185
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,370
them, so they think it is a different bottle
you belong to, you see, different category

186
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:15,790
of people. But they don’t think that you
are bad or good, they don’t pass judgment.

187
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:22,790
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

188
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,720
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

189
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

190
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,880
on the soil of Shri Ganesha. To all the Sahaja
yogis, you must show. But, as you know what,

191
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:48,930
we had horrible experiences so far, and how
people have been dominating and doing all

192
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:55,930
kinds of nonsensical things, money-wise and
otherwise also morality-wise. So it sometimes

193
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:07,250
upsets the whole balance of Sahaja Yoga because
it’s all depending on Shri Ganesha; that

194
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:15,770
means depending on Australians. And Australians
have all the possibility of reaching a great

195
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:26,150
height in Ganesh principle, because they have
the Mother Earth here sitting down. What else

196
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:33,120
do they want? You need not take to stupid
American-style things. I mean, if you see

197
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,680
their Hallowe’en, I tell you, you won’t
eat your food for eight days. And if you go

198
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:45,290
only to Rio, even you do not visit their carnivals,
but even if you see the pictures, you won’t

199
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:48,910
eat your food for one month, so horrible they
are.

200
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:55,910
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

201
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:06,310
special people? Or, this I have to warn you,
and people are all watching all over, all

202
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:18,710
Sahaja yogis are there; you know that all
over the world we have Sahaja yogis. They’re

203
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:25,710
watching everyone, and you have to do your
maximum to express your Ganesh principle,

204
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,990
which should be very easy for you. And as
I have told you, that Australia was a part

205
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:38,990
and parcel of India once upon a time. It has
come down here. So, at least in your films

206
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,890
and all that, you can say they’re dharmic,
they are dharmic. They’re not so bad as

207
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:50,890
the American films are, but still this idea
of copying the French or the Americans shows

208
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,680
that we have lost our personality. But Shri
Ganesha gives you a personality. He gives

209
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,610
you your personality, because He gives you
maryadas. You see, by maryadas only, you get

210
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,430
your personality. A person is known by his
maryadas. And that’s what has to come within

211
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,780
us, are our maryadas.

212
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,500
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha. As
of course you know, He has got four petals

213
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,850
and you know what He is placed in and what
He does and all that, and how He looks after

214
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,650
the chastity of His Mother and all that. But
the main thing is that how we develop Shri

215
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:37,650
Ganesha within us, how people see us as the
incarnations of innocence on this Earth. I

216
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:46,910
know it’s very difficult, but imagine Shri
Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell, of excretion,

217
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:55,960
because He’s just like a lotus, above everything
else, and He makes everything fragrant.

218
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,960
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

219
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:11,210
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

220
00:39:54,550 --> 00:40:01,550
the Sahaja yogis, and 
then among 

221
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:51,140
all 

222
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:37,200
the world.

223
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:46,240
May God bless you.
