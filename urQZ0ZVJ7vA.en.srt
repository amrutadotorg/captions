1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,892
1984-0622 The Experience of Truth - Part 4, London, England

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,892
but we have further, if you go, there’s a mosque. What is that mosque?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,892
It’s called as Hazarat Bhal means one hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept in that place.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,892
I said really, just imagine! One hair of Mohammed Sahib was kept in that place

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,892
and I caught it up at least five miles away.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,892
So that you can imagine that hair may not be aware of the vibrations it has,

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,892
but the one who is a human being and a realised soul gets the awareness five miles away from that hair,

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,892
that there lies the hair of Mohammed Sahib.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,892
Now for this hair there has been big quarrel and fight and this and that and then it was replaced,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,892
all sorts of things, but ones who were fighting even for that do not know what it is.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,892
Just fighting for nothing at all. Like that you can see that those things which have got,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,892
we can say matter in it, same matter becomes a human being after sometime

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,892
through evolutionary process and the same thing which was just a matter

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,892
when it becomes a human being, becomes aware of those divine vibrations.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,892
Before that it can not, so we cancel out all the animals. I had a dog which used to vibrate,

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,892
if anybody came used to say Mother what vibrations coming from this dog.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,892
And it used to feel if some man with nasty feelings or something would come in the house,

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,892
he knew it was, so it used to bark on that.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,892
He knew many things but he was not aware that he had vibrations,

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,892
he could not feel himself that he had vibrations.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,892
He kept a very good health and was a pedigree dog but the doctor said that

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,892
this dog is remarkable for his own pedigree, he’s too tall and too broad and very healthy you see,

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,892
but because of the vibrations he kept up that kind of health.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,892
So one has to understand that you become the truth,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,892
means your awareness itself becomes aware of Divine.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,892
That your central nervous system, or you can say that your brain evolves to that state

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,892
that you can feel the vibrations. That’s one thing.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,892
Then you can not only feel the vibrations but you can discern them,

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,892
you can find out whether these are good vibrations or bad vibrations.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,892
Then you can also say whether these vibrations are partial or full vibrations from the person,

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,892
if the person has got some sort of a disease or a trouble,

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,892
you can without knowing a word about medicine,

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,892
you can say this person is suffering from such and such diseases.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,892
Imagine the computer that we are, we are really the greatest computer

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,892
that anybody can produce. Human beings can’t produce this computer.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,892
The one they have produced is just a copy of this which is not such a great copy also,

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,892
because this computer sees something and knows this is this, it doesn’t think.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,892
Can you think of a computer which doesn’t think?

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,892
Just without thinking it knows, And that’s the computer we are.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,892
Now this great computer of our brain which just sees and knows, feels and knows,

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,892
smells and knows, this special computer becomes a greater,

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,892
we can say subtler instrument which knows the divine, which feels the divine,

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,892
which understands the divine and can manoeuvre it,

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,892
it can manoeuvre it. For example. A person has got some problem,

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,892
he is suffering from some disease, take it, he knows how to cure himself,

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,892
also he knows how to cure that person.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,892
Now don’t many people who say that we are doing, they are healers,

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,892
some people heal also, but it can be very dangerous with these healers,

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,892
because these healers are not the people who have any knowledge about the divine.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,892
Some of them could be realised souls, could be,

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,892
but they do not know what they are doing, what they have to do and some of them,

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,892
most of them are not the ones who are realised souls,

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,892
they are the people who use a kind of a spirit.

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,892
Like in this England, here in London we had one hospital once upon a time,

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,892
called late Doctor Langs Hospital, called as Doctor Langs International Hospital

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,892
or something like that. Now this doctor was dead

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,892
and he manifested into a soldier somewhere in Vietnam and told him that you go and see my son.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,892
And when he came to see the son,. the son said “How do you say that my father is in you?”

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,892
He said. “I’ll tell you the secret talks you had with your father” and he talked to him,

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,892
he was amazed. Now he said your father wants me to start a clinic.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,892
So he said “Are you a doctor?” He said “No I’m not a doctor,”

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,892
but he said there are many doctors who have died without expressing their skill,

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,892
so they would like to help and we should start this clinic.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,892
So the boy agreed and they started a clinic. Now see the father did not posses the boy

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,892
but he did posses another healthy person in Vietnam; where he got a shock,

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,892
and he possessed him and then they started their healing process.

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,892
So, actually I came to know about them because there was one lady in India who came to me

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,892
and she came to see me because she was suffering from horrible nervous trouble

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,892
and she came before me she was shaking before me just like this, so I said. “What’s this?”

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,892
She said. “This is my nervous trouble.” Then she told me that

75
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,892
she had some ulcer in her stomach and she had some problem with her ulcer

76
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,892
and she knew about this Doctor Langs International thing from someone.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,892
So she wrote to him saying that please cure me and one day she was just resting in her bed,

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,892
they told her that on such and such a day you rest in your bed and such and such a point,

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,892
that we’ll cure you. And she felt this shaking in her body,

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,892
the whole shaking came to her as a shock because they didn’t tell that you’ll be shaking.

81
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,892
And after the shaking stopped her ulcer was cured and she felt very much better,

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,892
but as the time passed within three years time she discovered that she’s a very nervous woman.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,892
She got frightened of everything and she used to shake and at a very young age

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,892
and her whole body started shaking. And doctors couldn’t understand what sort of a disease is this.

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,892
Now this kind of thing can be also so called healing,

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,892
but the healing has to have an intelligent answer, after realisation.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,892
Supposing we say Sahaja Yoga can heal cancer,

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,892
then we should be able to tell a doctor how we have cured the person of this trouble,

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,892
it’s not just I have touched a person and I’ve cured. Yes it has happened that way,

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,892
it may happen but that doesn’t mean that there is no explanation for it.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,892
There has to be an intelligent explanation, that on such an such centre we found

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,892
that it was exhausted, and when this exhausted centre was triggered by some entity,

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,892
then the cancer took place, and what we have done is to put back the centre.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,892
Now the doctor would be surprised because he will be surprised to know

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,892
that we know exactly where the cancer is, we know exactly how to put it right,

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,892
and we can give a full explanation to him, from what plexus it has happened,

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,892
and what it has gone, he will be surprised.

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,892
Then if you give realisation to that doctor, he gets realisation

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,892
and then he himself can cure other people, he can cure himself also,

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,892
but it has to have an intelligent explanation.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,892
This is what the truth becomes when you become a realised soul.

102
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,892
If a person is a realised soul, he sees truth so directly and that he can explain it

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,892
so the people can understand what he is going to say and what he is meaning.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,892
Its not something ambiguous. For example, now in the Bible we have a word called Holy Ghost.

105
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,892
Now we can say that “Holy Ghost” is a word which we can not explain

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,892
because if we just read Bible you can not understand the Holy Ghost,

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,892
because Christ or Holy Ghost are like oceans and you cannot just put it in one little cup

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,892
and say that this is it, and beyond this is nothing.

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,892
You have to go beyond it to see there are many cups filled with the knowledge

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,892
and you have to see all of them and find out what is the meaning of the word Holy Ghost,

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,892
in other scriptures also. And when you find the similarity between the two,

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,892
then you are surprised that this is what Holy Ghost is.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,892
But when we just take Bible as everything you see,

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,892
then I have seen people making Bible so small as that, putting in the golden box,

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,892
hanging it here. Imagine! It is absolutely absurd.

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,892
Bible is to be respected no doubt, it has great knowledge in it

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,892
but as the Bible itself I feel is a microscopic thing, is very microscopic every word is microscopic

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,892
and to go into it’s details and all that you must first get realisation

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,892
and get explanation from other places, other dictionaries which can explain it better.

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,892
But when we stick on to one sort of thing, then we are flabbergasted,

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,892
like other day we had a controversy about Christ and I told you very frankly

122
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,892
that Paul is all wrong, he is not a realised soul at all and he doesn’t understand God,

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,892
he doesn’t understand religion. And that is what, is when the truth comes to you,

124
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,892
you see everything clearly and all the people, truth being absolute say the same thing.

125
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,892
Take Kahil Gibran, he says the same thing, take your William Blake, in England,

126
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,892
any one you take they say the same thing because there is no difference of opinion

127
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,892
as far as the truth is concerned, if you are facing the truth.

128
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,892
And the trouble is when you are a human being you can be, also dishonest.

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,892
Supposing even if you see that this microscope is placed before me, all right.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,892
Then a person who is not a realised soul can tell a lie also, there was no microscope,

131
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,892
can tell but not a realised soul.

132
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,892
And a person who is possessed may not even see a microscope.

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,892
You will be surprised some don’t see me, they see the light, if they are possessed,

134
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,892
their eyes are possessed, if somebody is a drunk fellow he may not even see me,

135
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,892
he just walks over me like that. So the awareness before realisation can be blurred

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,892
and there for a simple truthful thing as you see with your own eyes there can be aberrations

137
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,892
there can be other explanations and other descriptions.

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,892
But after realisation the basic truth never changes.

139
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,892
You may say in a poetic way like Paul has said this;

140
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,892
Paul seems to be a strange man to me,

141
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,892
I may say that he was not honest or somebody may say something

142
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,892
but the truth about Paul is the same but those who are not realised souls will not understand.

143
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,892
They have built big churches in his name, people are going to the church,

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,892
now people are flabbergasted, they don’t know what to do,

145
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,892
they have built up the churches in the name of the Christ, everything,

146
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,892
and denies the miracles of Christ, so now what to do?

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,892
They are lost. They don’t know how to get over this feeling of frustration,

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,892
that they love Christ so much, they adored him

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,892
and they thought him to be such a great personality that The Son of God,

150
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,892
and then now suddenly to say that he has no miracles.

151
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,892
You get a shock, but don’t believe them. Don’t believe them because Christ was a Son of God,

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,892
no doubt about it. But how can you explain,

153
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,892
when you just read Bible you cannot see, and then Paul, this Paul who was he?

154
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,892
He should not have been there, he is not a Christian in anyway,

155
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,892
because he had never seen Christ.

156
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,892
So this kind of a challenge, only a person who is a realised soul can put it and all realised souls

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,892
will stand by with that person, they’ll have the same voice about it.

158
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,892
Whether you go to the antiquities or you go in the future

159
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,892
any time a realised soul will come he will say the same thing.

160
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,892
That’s why there is so much similarity, I should say the unity,

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,892
in all these people whether it is Lao Tse, or whether it is Mohammed Sahib

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,892
or whether it is Raja Janaka Or Nanakaa they say the same thing.

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,892
Now where is the difference that comes in?

164
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,892
Also we see very clearly when the truth is your own.

165
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,892
The difference comes that these incarnations came for a different type of a job.

166
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,892
Like Moses came to establish the void, as we say here, in the centre.

167
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,892
All these Primordial masters came to do that.

168
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,892
So their job was, like we can say like Guru Nanak,

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,892
or all these people who were Primordial masters came on this Earth to establish the balance

170
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,892
and that’s why whatever they have said, all have said the same thing.

171
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,892
Then came Rama. Supposing Rama came on this earth,

172
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,892
he came here to establish the benevolent king.

173
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,892
What is a benevolent king, the idea of a benevolent king, so he talks differently,

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,892
then came say Krishna. Krishna came to establish the truth

175
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,892
that you have to ascend first and secondly he came to show that the world is just a play of God.

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,892
Then came Christ, now Christ came on this earth

177
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,892
to create a full awareness within us that we are the spirit.

178
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,892
So the accent of their preaching has been for the purpose they have come.

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,892
For example I have to give realisation to people,

180
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,892
I have to raise the Kundalini and I have to explain all of them and integrate them

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,892
so I have to talk about all of them.

182
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,892
But my task is easier because there are sensible people in these days,

183
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,892
but when Christ lived, what sort of people lived there, absolutely cruel, violent, nonsensical.

184
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,892
Mohammed sahib had a very bad time, Guru Nanak had a very bad time,

185
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,892
none of them have such a nice time that I am having.

186
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,892
None of you are going to crucify me.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,892
So you must understand that the truth when it comes to a person like that,

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,892
not only that he knows but he can make others also know,

189
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,892
this is what William Blake has said. That at this time men of God, that’s you people,

190
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,892
will become Prophets and they will have powers to make others Prophets.

191
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,892
So people sometimes say why didn’t happened earlier?  No that was not the time,

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,892
now the blossom time has come, so it is happening.

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,892
Then you see the truth in its full extent.

194
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,892
Like at that time this was the situation, today this is the situation and according to the situation

195
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,892
or the development of tree of life the work is done.

196
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,892
This is what one has to understand, the complete comprehensive idea

197
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,892
about the spiritual growth of human beings. Unless until you have that kind of an idea,

198
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,892
whatever you have, is like a person is saying that the flower is the tree,

199
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,892
somebody saying that the leaf is the tree, and they are fighting.

200
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,892
Everything is the tree, everything is needed for the tree.

201
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,892
So when you understand through your self realisation, that truth is what it is.

202
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,892
We can not change it. So you become the truth and strength of truth comes in you

203
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,892
and then you’re not afraid of anything. You say it out, loudly.

204
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,892
You say this is the truth, I know this is the truth. People may not accept it, they may crucify you,

205
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,892
what they like, but truth is truth and that truth remains for ever and ever, it is eternal.

206
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,892
But this brain that we do not think much of becomes aware of the truth,

207
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,892
this is the blessing of the truth upon us which comes to us

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,892
through our self-realisation or we say through our spirit.

209
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,892
There can be complete seven lectures on truth if I go on but,

210
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,892
I think I have to see to the other side of it, what else it does.

211
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,892
Another thing happens to you is your attention.

212
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,892
Now our attention is out side, the reason is our brain has become like a prism

213
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,892
and the rays that come into us of awareness also are thrown out

214
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,892
and as a reaction our attention goes outside.

215
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,892
If I tell you take your attention inside you can not take it, just cannot,

216
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,892
something has to happen inside and that’s why when this Kundalini rises within you,

217
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,892
then your attention is attracted inside

218
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,892
and this happening takes place and then you find that you can enter inside as well as outside,

219
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,892
but otherwise you cannot. Many people say that we are praying,

220
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,892
now you are praying outside, there is no connection.

221
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,892
First the connection must be established.

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,892
So when your attention is outside you react to everything.

223
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,892
For example I come and see these flowers, then I react to it and then I say something,

224
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,892
or another thing I see all the time I am reacting outside.

225
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,892
As a result of all the kind of sensations we get out of our reactions

226
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,892
our attention becomes absolutely disturbed and we get into lot of troubles.

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,892
First of all our eyes are not steady, they go on hovering from here to there,

228
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,892
God knows what are we looking for.

229
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,892
The eyes become impure because we start thinking about things,

230
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,892
as soon as we see something we start thinking and barrier is created.

231
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,892
For example there is a beautiful piece, something very beautiful you see,

232
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,892
and looking at it if there is a thought you can not enjoy it,

233
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,892
but if there’s no thought, there’s pure rapport, pure connection

234
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,892
between that beautiful art and yourself,

235
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,892
then you just see it and enjoy that joy of the artist which he has poured into it,

236
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,892
without thinking about it, otherwise normally people will think oh how many pounds can I save?

237
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,892
Or what should I do? Should I purchase it or not?

238
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,892
All sorts of nonsensical flippant, cheap ideas can come into your head,

239
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,892
or could be something higher also, this colour is not matched with that and this,

240
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,892
but a person who’s a realised soul will just see.

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,892
Just like children, they just look, in the same way, without thinking.

242
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,892
So the first thing that happens to your attention, that the thoughts subside.

243
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,892
Thought is the first problem that has started with ego and now when the thoughts subside,

244
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,892
then you become peaceful. People talk of peace, we should have peace,

245
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,892
how can you have peace? It is not possible, is an impossible situation.

246
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,892
You see we think by thinking by organising by manipulating, we’ll have peace, you cannot.

247
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,892
You cannot have peace that way? How will you have peace?

248
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,892
When the peace is established on your attention, when your attention is peaceful,

249
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,892
when we are absolutely without any thoughts, then the peace is resides.

250
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,892
After all the peace is disturbed by human beings only, isn’t it?

251
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,892
It is not disturbed by something else is disturbed by the human beings.

252
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,892
And now if the human beings are not peaceful how can you have peace by talks?

253
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,892
On the contrary when there are talks be sure that there will be some violent action after that,

254
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:20,892
always it happens, because thought is incapable of keeping your attention in balance.

255
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,892
Now how do you remove the thought from your mind is the problem.

256
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,892
Thoughts are all the time in your mind, if you get possessed you may not have thoughts,

257
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,892
but otherwise which is the other way?

258
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,892
The other way is the Kundalini when it rises, a thought rises and falls off

259
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,892
and another thought rises and falls off,

260
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,892
but when the Kundalini rises, then what happens, these thoughts become elongated

261
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,892
and starts some work inside and there is gap in-between

262
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,892
and this gap is place of our peace.

263
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,892
If you achieve that peace the world peace can be achieved.

264
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,892
By just taking placards, by shouting for peace, you can not establish peace.

265
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,892
Peace has to come from the hearts of human beings,

266
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,892
in the hearts of human beings peace can be only established when you establish the spirit within

267
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,892
it’s core, where it manifests the bliss of peace.

268
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,892
When you start enjoying the bliss of peace you don’t want wars, you don’t think of a wars

269
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,892
and that is the state where now the human beings have to rise and go to that.

270
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,892
So these horrible times which we call as Kali yuga, the modern times

271
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,892
which are the times of complete illusion and when all the value system is changed,

272
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,892
where everybody seems to be unhappy and sick,

273
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,892
is the time also preceding the Kruthayuga, the time where everything will be done,

274
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,892
perfected and established. That’s the meaning of Kruthayuga.

275
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,892
So to begin with primitive times which were called Kritta yuga are established again

276
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,892
the primitive is again established,

277
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,892
but here with the awareness, like as I told you the matter becomes aware of itself.

278
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,892
The Kundalini which is a potential thing, which is a potential power of desire within us,

279
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,892
which is we can solve the primitive, manifests itself and becomes aware itself.

280
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,892
That is what is Sahaja Yoga today,

281
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,892
it’s all Sahaja, it’s all spontaneous all life process has been spontaneous,

282
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,892
but today that is what it is.

283
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,892
So spontaneously our attention becomes peaceful, absolutely peaceful,

284
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,892
and when that peace is achieved, that peace is established within your heart through the ascent,

285
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,892
then every bit of that peace emits peace.

286
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,892
Such a person wherever he is, he emits peace, wherever he is, if there is quarrel going on,

287
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,892
there will be peace. Even we have seen if there one person who is a realised soul in a train,

288
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,892
and if there is an accident everybody is saved, even one person.

289
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,892
There are many examples where, in a bus there was one lady who was a realised soul

290
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,892
and the bus fell down with three somersaults and fell on its four legs

291
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,892
and everybody was safe and the thing started and they tried to find out

292
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,892
who was the realised soul, because in India we understand these things.

293
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,892
We are more grown up in spiritual sensitivity than in the material sensitivity.

294
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,892
You are very sensitive to material things we should also learn something from you I should say,

295
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,892
but you should also learn something from us and that is the spiritual sensitivity.

296
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,892
To understand what serenity is and what superficiality is.

297
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,892
So with this attention being absolutely stationed on a balance,

298
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,892
you start seeing the superficiality and you start discarding the superficiality.

299
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,892
You immediately see that this is superficial there’s nothing in it

300
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,892
and then the attention only accepts whatever is deep, whatever is divine.

301
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,892
The rest of it is rejected, it doesn’t accept, it doesn’t react, it doesn’t say anything about it,

302
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,892
it doesn’t accept, it has nothing to do with it, it just separated.

303
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,892
The attention keeps a distance from all superficial things, it has no enjoyment.

304
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,892
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis, who are here today, who used to indulge in all kinds of things,

305
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,892
all kinds of things which I was amazed. How could they go, because they were Men of God.

306
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,892
But this situation is such, the atmosphere is such, that they were, like that.

307
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,892
They had given up their parents, they had given up everything

308
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,892
and had really become like vagabonds I should say,

309
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,892
but when they got their realisation they settled down, everything settled down.

310
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,892
And now they know they don’t go to those places now, they just don’t like it,

311
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,892
they don’t want to see it on the TV. If it’s on the TV, they put it off,

312
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,892
because the attention has now the sense, the sense I would say, of purity.

313
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,892
The sense of morality, which morality which we know of is hypocrisy outside.

314
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,892
We are hypocritical but this is inner morality which just keep you moral.

315
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,892
Inner quality, like Christ now, he would not do something filthy, will he?

316
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,892
Why didn’t do anything like any other person

317
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,892
why he was not attracted to something that was not good;

318
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,892
because his attention was pure; it would not accept anything that was not pure.

319
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,892
Like that your attention becomes absolutely pure, your eyes become innocent,

320
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,892
your eyes do not have dirty ideas, lust and greed, but they have purity in them.

321
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,892
And wherever you put your eyes that becomes purer,

322
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,892
wherever you look that becomes purer and you spread purity through your eyes,

323
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,892
not lust and greed.

324
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,892
And this is something must happen today because the time has come our eyes are tired,

325
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,892
now tired of looking at all horrible things.

326
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,892
Let us now have those eyes who discard. Then why will they have dirty things?

327
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,892
It’s only we have created this filth, once we discard it, it will all disappear, its our own creation.

328
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,892
Whom can we blame? Not the birds have done it, nor the tigers have done it,

329
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,892
or the trees have done it, it’s we the human beings, we have done all this nonsense.

330
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,892
If we get purified everything will be purified.

331
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,892
Now the attention becomes, the attention becomes collectively conscious, becomes.

332
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,892
So far your attention is not. Your attention is, you can see a person,

333
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,892
how his hair is or what dress he is wearing and all these things,

334
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,892
but you can not penetrate into that person to feel what sort of trouble that person has,

335
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,892
what centre he’s catching, whether he is a good man or a bad man,

336
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,892
from the divine point of view.

337
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,892
Because your attention has achieved that state of collective consciousness you can understand,

338
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,892
at a very sight of the person you can say what sort of a person he is.

339
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,892
I mean I have many experiences like that I told once my husband,

340
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,892
that this man has came to loot our country and he was shocked. He said.

341
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,892
How do you pass such a remark, just looking at his face?

342
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,892
I said he has came to loot our country, and he did it, he did it, within three years time

343
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,892
and we found out that he looted us out, like that, we can have many people

344
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,892
who are really are at the top of organisations, Governments, this, that, are really cheats.

345
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,892
Are going to one day ruin the whole country or destroy us completely,

346
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,892
you can see it from the face of it, but that penetration can come only when

347
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,892
you have those pure eyes, When you are yourself impure how can you see it?

348
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,892
When your glasses mirror, supposing there is a, your eyes are covered with some colour,

349
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,892
then how can you see? To see something clearly your eyes must be clear and clean,

350
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,892
and that’s what happens to us, but there’s nothing wrong,

351
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,892
once the Kundalini rises he kindles a light, you can see a twinkle in the eyes of a person

352
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,892
who is a realised soul, their eyes are twinkling, and there’s a kind of a light,

353
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,892
you can see in the eyes of such a person

354
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,892
and then you know that a such a person is a realised soul.

355
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,892
It’s very simple to make out even the eyes of a bad man and good person

356
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,892
when you develop your own inner sensitivity

357
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,892
and this comes through the attention being absolutely at balance,

358
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,892
no thoughts, rising you look at a person without any barrier.

359
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,892
For example, you see, say I see an Indian and immediately I think,

360
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,892
oh from what country and what part of the country, then who is he, this that, supposing.

361
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,892
So that’s he’s lost that it’s nothing important, what is important is,

362
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,892
what sort of a person he is He may be your own brother, may be a nasty fellow tomorrow

363
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,892
he may murder you So it does not matter whatever you have understood through your brain,

364
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,892
is not important, what is important if you are seeing through and through what sort of a person he is.

365
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,892
So the attention has to be purified,

366
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,892
but that you don’t have to do your Kundalini itself purifies your attention,

367
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,892
you become collectively conscious, so many things happen to your attention.

368
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,892
Sitting down here you can tell about people, what’s happening to them.

369
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,892
Now the Kritta Yuga means it happens, it is manifested,

370
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,892
so now the attention manifests itself, it’s another very remarkable thing has happens.

371
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,892
Like I’m sitting here now and I’m thinking of someone, all right,

372
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,892
I’m thinking of someone, if I want I can think, if I don’t want I need not think, that is the situation,

373
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,892
but after realisation somebody needs your help, you’ll just think of that person

374
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,892
and if you think of that person, that person is helped.

375
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,892
Even if the person doesn’t know and he’s thinking of God,

376
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,892
you may help that person just thinking of him. It happens,

377
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:56,892
it has happened you must have seen one of these things happened in Bedford is very surprising for people but it’s a fact.

378
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,892
The fact is like this, that some people were going, no,

379
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,892
one boy See extract from Bedfordshire Journal: Appendix (a) was going on a motor cycle

380
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,892
and he fell down from a bridge and they called for the ambulance,

381
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,892
but after some time the boy himself got up and came up

382
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,892
and they were surprised because they expected him to be dead you see,

383
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,892
they were surprised how did he walk up.

384
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,892
So they asked him, he said, there was, no I’ll tell you in the hospital;

385
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,892
they took him to the hospital and there was also police people and he told them that

386
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,892
I fell down all right, but a lady came in a white car,

387
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,892
I have a white car, and she came down and she healed me.

388
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,892
They said which lady, he said an Indian lady, she was wearing a white sari,

389
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,892
they could not believe, said this must be an hallucination.

390
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,892
Next day he saw my photograph, because I was speaking in Bedford at that time

391
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,892
when he fell down like this, we had a bigger hall than this

392
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,892
and I was speaking there when this had happened.

393
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,892
So they were quite surprised and he said that a little point down below is left there,

394
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:15,892
she said you come to me and I’ll cure it. …….

395
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,892
But it’s nothing great it’s nothing special

396
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,892
because if you can receive on the television something from the ether,

397
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,892
you can always receive at that level also and you can manifest them,

398
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,892
but in the television what we receive is, it doesn’t manifest

399
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,892
supposing we see some photograph of someone, it doesn’t get up and cure us does it?

400
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,892
It does not, but here attention when you put to it, the attention manifests,

401
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,892
see how fantastic it is. It is very hard to believe but it happens,

402
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,892
it happens, that the attention itself manifests.

403
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,892
So this attention that becomes enlightened becomes one with the divine,

404
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,892
it manifests and it acts and it helps. It is very miraculous.

405
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,892
But now those who are Sahaja Yogis here know a thousand and one stories about it,

406
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,892
it has happened like that, it can happen to you, it can happen to anyone of you.

407
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,892
Like once I remember a girl, she went to a place

408
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,892
which was a little lonely and some people attacked her

409
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,892
and some Sahaja Yogis were going by bus, so they just suddenly got down at a place

410
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,892
and just walked, they didn’t know why they walked there

411
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,892
and they found that so many people were attacking this girl and they just saved the girl from there.

412
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,892
And they were from a different place and she said how are you all here?

413
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,892
Oh we don’t know we just felt we should walk this side, so we came,

414
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,892
we just felt the vibrations we just came walked here, and we saw you in this condition.

415
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,892
It can happen that way, so you become one unit, one unit.

416
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,892
Like the part and parcel of the body.

417
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,892
So you become the attention, makes you a part and parcel of the whole body,

418
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,892
but also the awareness of it, like this big finger, is part and parcel of the whole body;

419
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,892
but is not aware, is not aware that it is part and parcel of the whole body.

420
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,892
It acts but there it is aware and it acts without even having any connection outside

421
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:45,892
like ductless glands it acts and it manifests and it works out the way it has to work out.

422
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,892
It’s such a fantastic thing is the attention that becomes.

423
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,892
Then the last and the most important thing is that you become the joy.

424
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,892
Nowadays we have lost the sense of joy.

425
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,892
With the smallest thing we get irritated and angry.

426
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,892
You see the small children running “you should not run here I am disturbed”.

427
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,892
I mean children when they run and the sound they make, so sweet,

428
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,892
so beautiful, so joy giving, but she can’t bear she’s so tense,

429
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,892
she’s just waiting to hear, she comes down, there’s one child, she shouts at the child,

430
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,892
the child cannot even speak, why are you shouting at the child,

431
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,892
he makes noise he can’t talk, oh then she goes back.

432
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,892
All the time you are just waiting to find faults with others, waiting to complain,

433
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,892
waiting to see what others are doing wrong, not enjoying them at all.

434
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,892
Once I was travelling from Luknow to Delhi in a train

435
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,892
and we had ladies compartment and we were four ladies,

436
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,892
but there was only one lady with me and myself and in the other compartment

437
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,892
there were two young boys and they had met after a long time

438
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,892
I think they were in college together. And they were hitting each other

439
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,892
and you know talking with each other you know in such a friendly manner,

440
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,892
I was just enjoying you know and this lady was so angry,

441
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,892
she said these stupid fools don’t allow me to sleep,

442
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,892
I said we sleep every time enjoy the way they are having,

443
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,892
she said what you are enjoying really enjoying, I am feeling my young age has come,

444
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,892
and hitting each other and you come along now, what is it this way and that,

445
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,892
is so interesting such innocent talk they were having, this lady got so infuriated,

446
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,892
and she said no, she said no I’m going to hit them hard,

447
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,892
I said you cant so that, at the most she knocked ten times she knocked I said why are you knocking let it be,

448
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,892
I am enjoying, so she said no, no I just can’t manage I can’t, then she went out,

449
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,892
her attention you see would just not allow her to sleep.

450
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,892
She went out shouted at them “ what do you mean by doing like this

451
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,892
and what do you mean by talking like this”, poor things you know like this,

452
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,892
I felt so sad, so when she went away, I went and told them doesn’t matter you know

453
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,892
she’s still her ears are very very sharp you see,

454
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,892
so when you talk, talk in muffled voices she wont know, but even that she could hear,

455
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,892
she would not spare them, the whole night you see she didn’t sleep just hearing, are they talking?

456
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,892
She asked me, don’t you think they’re talking? Now better sleep.

457
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,892
That’s how our attention is, horrible, it can never enjoy anyone.

458
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,892
What the birds sing, how the children run and how the people talk, you see enjoy,

459
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,892
it’s so enjoyable everything is such an enjoyment which we have lost, that sensitivity completely.

460
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,892
We cannot enjoy each other but then we enjoy, we just enjoy the person who is a realised soul,

461
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,892
just sitting with a person, nobodies talking, many a time we Sahaja Yogis travelling together,

462
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,892
there’s a pin drop silence nobody’s talking and the ticket collector said

463
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,892
why are you meditating or what, nobody’s talking just sitting enjoying,

464
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,892
he can’t understand and what’s the matter with these people their not talking,

465
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,892
nobody talking just enjoying each other, just sitting enjoying the company,

466
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,892
then nobody bothers about the comfort.

467
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,892
You know sometimes we have our programs where we have thousand people or something

468
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,892
and also sometimes we go to India, it’s horrible spartan living,

469
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,892
absolutely spartan to the last we can say,

470
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,892
and they don’t mind at all and they don’t mind anything.

471
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,892
I said you want to go to the villages but be prepared it’s a horrible place.

472
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,892
Oh no, no Mother we enjoy. They said our Kundalini rises,

473
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,892
it just goes boom in India and we just enjoy that, we don’t want anything else and it is so difficult

474
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,892
for them to send them to send back to their own country that you actually push them with a pistol,

475
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,892
now go back. And they enjoy all the discomfort in that country

476
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,892
I was surprised absolutely most uncomfortable places there.

477
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,892
But we had four Americans once and three of them ran away, they couldn’t bear it,

478
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:01,892
they said Mother its too much. and we had to force them,

479
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:11,892
we said we have to stick them with something and they stick on here but they would not.

480
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,892
They said, no mother it’s too much for us, how can we live like that.

481
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,892
I said what comforts you have in your country, you see all plastics, you eat in plastic,

482
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,892
everything plastic, even for towels you have plastic at least in India you have everything cotton.

483
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,892
You have a plate of say, a beautiful plate of brass to eat food,

484
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,892
what do you have in your country that you are talking of your comfort

485
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,892
and they got a little bit I said at least we have motor cars, all right

486
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,892
we have got bullock carts doesn’t matter but it is too much for them to go by a bullock cart

487
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,892
because you see their body is all shaken up and their attention all outside you see.

488
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,892
So this is what happens your attention becomes balanced,

489
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,892
attention becomes collectively conscious you start enjoying others

490
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,892
and this so called comfort which we really vie is zero.

491
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,892
Like here I see if you go to Yorkshire you find people have gone to Brighton. Why?

492
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,892
For a holiday and the people from Brighton have came to Yorkshire for a holiday.

493
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,892
I said. But why? I can’t understand they can’t sit in the house you see nothing like a Grahasta,

494
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,892
means the one who stays in the house is there,

495
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,892
there’s nothing like a householder they are always out,

496
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,892
out of the house as soon as they get holiday they must pack up and go out,

497
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,892
some people are just cruising. Why? Why are you cruising?

498
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,892
You must sit at home, home is the place of bliss, sit down,

499
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,892
talk together and have some rapport, be nice to each other.

500
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,892
That’s not there you will have a television in between you,

501
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,892
otherwise if there is no television there is a fight.

502
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,892
Nobody can stand the company of another person even for five minutes either

503
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,892
you have television or a newspaper or something in between.

504
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,892
There’s nothing like enjoying the company of another person. Why?

505
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,892
Because our attention is so shaky, it just gets disturbed for nothing at all,

506
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,892
I mean how can you live in a place, in any place without any sound?

507
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,892
You want to have a soundless area then why God as given you ears?

508
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,892
See He has given you the ears to enjoy the music of his rhythm and that you can only feel

509
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,892
when you become a realised soul before that you are very uncomfortable,

510
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,892
you have all kinds of wrinkles all over, and you ask them why have you got wrinkles?

511
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,892
Oh God, you know I have neighbours who are young boys, they are all the time singing loudly,

512
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,892
I will grow old in no time. I said I would go and join them if it was so,

513
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,892
what is there to feel so bad about it? What is there to feel that you cannot bear it?

514
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,892
You see, why should you be so tired about it?

515
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,892
Because our attention makes us tired all the time our attention is,

516
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,892
and the worst is our attention is on the watch. Watching the time, for what?

517
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,892
For what are you watching the time, there is no more going to be a war of Waterloo anything.

518
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,892
You don’t have to worry on that point, when the bomb will come, it will come without knowing;

519
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,892
so why watch the time? After all that’s the only thing that is important isn’t it,

520
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,892
otherwise what is important, is enjoy the time, this moment, every moment has a dynamism in it.

521
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,892
But you are thinking, now to go, now Mother is speaking, whether I’ll get my train or not,

522
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,892
I should look at my watch now as soon as time is I’ll run.

523
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,892
But I tell you for a Sahaja Yogi the trains will stop, the aeroplanes will stop;

524
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,892
everything stops for them. Because after all its all God’s realm you are entering into.

525
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,892
Who is greater than God, who is more powerful than Him,

526
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,892
once you enter into His Kingdom everything works out, you know it works out.

527
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,892
Mother we don’t know how it worked out, it works out.

528
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,892
They talk in third person, it works out.

529
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:07,892
So the joy of those happenings, the joy of that blissfullness,

530
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,892
that security of God, fills you up and when it fills you up

531
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,892
you feel absolutely relaxed. You feel it’s all done for you.

532
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,892
Now the gentleman has gone you need not look at him, actually when he was sitting

533
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,892
he was having big things and it happens with people,

534
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,892
because I think he’s a possessed person and with me sitting here sometimes you know,

535
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,892
they go into contortions and do all kinds of things, better that he’s gone.

536
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,892
But you don’t pay attention to him, he’s nothing important, there’s no need to turn your eyes.

537
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,892
Just now were talking something nice, lets talk of something nice,

538
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,892
why put the attention to something that’s not so nice.

539
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,892
So attention should be at the nice things as we say but it is never. How do we do?

540
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,892
We do it by enjoying the nice things, by understanding the nice things,

541
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,892
just our attention goes there and whatever else may be there we just don’t see, we just don’t see.

542
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,892
We once went to a place called Nepal, you must have heard about Nepal and Kathmandu

543
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,892
and my daughters were there with me and normally Indian people are a little bit,

544
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,892
sort of you see with daughters, they would not carry them to places

545
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,892
if there are erotics and all that, actually we had never seen erotics in all our lives you see

546
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,892
because our attention is not there.

547
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,892
So we saw the whole of Nepal we never saw any erotics you see,

548
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,892
second time I went my disciple was there he was writing a book

549
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,892
and he said Mother do you know that Nepal has the maximum number of erotics?

550
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,892
I said no, I never saw. We were moving about with our daughters

551
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,892
we had never seen any erotics anywhere.

552
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,892
Oh it’s full with that. I said where on top of every temple

553
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,892
I said why do you see the top of the temple, why don’t you see inside the temple,

554
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,892
he said no on top of the temple you’ll find lots of these erotics.

555
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,892
I said where? You know to my amazement when we went there the Japanese had put up,

556
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:14,892
long, these wires and what you call them, what you call them those big machine like ladders,

557
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,892
special ladders they have and with the zoom lenses they were taking photographs of these erotics.

558
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,892
I said Baba what’s the matter with these?

559
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,892
I said what is there to see in that, and they were taking photographs of these.

560
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,892
I said from this distance I can’t see anything. I mean any Indian who goes there,

561
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,892
goes to a temple, his attention is on the Deity and he’s not bothered we never saw these things.

562
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,892
What is there outside?

563
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,892
And these Japanese are there with the zoom there’s one falling down and holding onto the wire,

564
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,892
another standing on his head trying to arrange the camera, to get what?

565
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,892
That filth, dirt. I was amazed because our attention is used to filth,

566
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,892
you see if you know people who are, called a sweepers in India, they have to clean the,

567
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,892
which is not very good thing, but they do dirt cleaning thing, or the garbage cleaning;

568
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,892
and they have no nose to feel the dirt or anything. You see they become like animals,

569
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,892
they can pass through any dirt or filth.

570
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:28,892
Same thing happened to us, we have no sense left of sin. What’s wrong? So what!

571
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,892
That’s what we have lost sensitivity to sense

572
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,892
but after realisation you just become sensitivity and you abhor it, you just leave it.

573
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,892
So the discrimination takes place.

574
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,892
You never enjoy a sinful act and the enjoyment of righteousness

575
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,892
and virtue starts flowering into and you become flowering personality.

576
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,892
You really enjoy yourself, you never say I hate myself

577
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,892
or you never use this word I hate you and next movement I love you.

578
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,892
That sort of a nonsense goes away from your tongue.

579
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,892
You become beautiful person whose never bored, whose never bored.

580
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,892
You enjoy your own company so much even if you are in jail you’re enjoying yourself,

581
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,892
whether outside, you enjoying yourself because you are there, you are not lost.

582
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,892
So this is how our attention becomes enlightened and you become the joy.

583
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,892
And this joy fills you up completely. You become personality of magnetism, complete magnetism.

584
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,892
I was surprise that best perfume that they produce in Paris is called as joy,

585
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,892
is the most expensive is joy, I think they have found out that joy has that magnetism in it,

586
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,892
and it is from pure flowers, actually these flowers we find in India.

587
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,892
I don’t know where you find them here or not, from where the joy is made,

588
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,892
but whatever it is, what I find that the people are hitting the point all right,

589
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:04,892
in every way this is joy, the perfume. Joy means the joy is the perfume in a human being.

590
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,892
If you have that within you, you may not take bath for ten days

591
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,892
you will never have a problem of any smelling or anything,

592
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,892
because you are perfume, you become a perfume.

593
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,892
Anywhere, even some people think of me they get the perfume.

594
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,892
All kinds of perfumes you might say, it happens like that,

595
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,892
because in the attention the Mother earth which was the element,

596
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,892
the matter becomes the perfume, the causal; causal of the mother earth is perfume,

597
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,892
it becomes the perfume.

598
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,892
The magnetism of the Mother Earth becomes the magnetism in your personality.

599
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,892
Whatever you have, got it from five elements, goes back into its primitive stage,

600
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,892
in the sense that it becomes its causal. Like it becomes the glow,

601
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:01,892
the phagous is the, the causal of light, the causal of light is phagous, is the glow,

602
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,892
your face glows, your skin glows, there’s a glow on your face.

603
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,892
Sometimes you find glow around the thing, but to see glow is not good,

604
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:19,892
that I’ll tell you sometimes later, but you do see a person like this has glow on his face.

605
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,892
So you become your primitive, or you can say your causal, of which you are made,

606
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,892
all your five elements express in it’s causal.

607
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,892
But now the causal is aware, that’s the only difference there is.

608
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,892
So you become the joy, source of joy, and the giver of joy and you yourself enjoy yourself,

609
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,892
because your ‘self’ is so glorious, so great and so joy

610
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,892
May God Bless You..

611
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,000
End
