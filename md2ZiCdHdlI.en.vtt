00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.259
We cannot meditate

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:48.754
we only can be in meditation

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.254
When we say we are going to meditate

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:54.254
it has no meaning

00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:58.554
We have to be in meditation

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:04.399
Either you are inside the house or outside the house

00:01:04.724 --> 00:01:11.245
You cannot be inside the house and then say that: “Now I’m outside the house.”

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.279
Or when you are outside the house you cannot say: “I’m inside the house.”

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:17.889
In the same way

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:23.480
you are moving in three dimensions of your life

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.424
– of emotional and physical and mental being

00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:31.204
You are not inside yourself.

00:01:31.563 --> 00:01:41.148
But when you are inside that you are in thoughtless awareness.

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:43.598
Then, not only that you are there

00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:45.703
but you are everywhere

00:01:45.903 --> 00:01:47.714
because that is the place

00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:52.374
that is the point where you are really in universal…

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:56.562
From there you are in contact with the Principle

00:01:56.902 --> 00:02:04.653
with the Shakti, with the Power that permeates into every particle

00:02:04.862 --> 00:02:09.887
that is matter , into every thought that is emotion

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:15.543
into every planning and thinking of the whole world.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:25.112
You permeate into all the elements that have created this beautiful Earth

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:29.633
You permeate into earth

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:33.833
you permeate into Akasha [sky, ether]

00:02:34.272 --> 00:02:36.043
into teja [light]

00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:40.053
into sound

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:45.663
But your movement is very slow.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:50.097
Then you say: “I’m meditating,”

00:02:50.807 --> 00:03:00.476
that means you are moving in permeation with the Universal Being

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:03.742
But you are not moving yourself

00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:08.146
you are just unloading yourself to be free

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:14.472
from the weight of things that do not allow you to move

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:25.562
When you are in meditation you must allow yourself to be in thoughtless awareness

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:32.222
There, the Unconscious Itself, the Achetana itself will take charge of you

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:36.777
You will start moving with the force of Achetana.

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:39.816
The Unconscious is going to work it out.

00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:45.331
It is going to take you there, where It wants you to go

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:49.397
You keep to thoughtless awareness all the time.

00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:54.026
Try to keep to thoughtless awareness as much as you can.

00:03:54.436 --> 00:03:56.281
When you are in thoughtless awareness

00:03:56.481 --> 00:04:00.281
you must know that you are in the Kingdom of God

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:08.246
and His people , His arrangements, His consciousness

00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:11.417
is going to look after you.

00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.921
Even when you are giving vibrations to other people

00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.851
I have noticed that you are not in thoughtless awareness.

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.016
If you give vibrations in thoughtless awareness

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:25.882
you will not catch anything

00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:29.531
because all these entities that enter into you

00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:33.121
all these material problems that come into you

00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:41.292
come when you are in those three dimensions.

00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:44.056
Through Sahaja Yoga

00:04:44.256 --> 00:04:49.022
you have opened your gates of your own being.

00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:52.011
You have entered into your own kingdom

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:55.401
but you do not keep there.

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.426
You come out of it

00:04:57.626 --> 00:05:01.041
and again you go back and settle down – doesn’t matter

00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.242
You should not feel so disappointed about it, so frustrated.

00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:07.921
You know people have worked for thousands of years

00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:12.381
and they could not separate themselves from themselves

00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:16.412
Only you people, the Sahaja Yogis

00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:20.821
whom are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh himself

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:22.942
are so powerful

00:05:23.301 --> 00:05:29.751
that they can give awakening and realisation to other people.

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:33.786
Even if you are caught up, you have seen you have powers.

00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:36.956
Even if you feel that the vibrations are not coming

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:38.881
you know you have powers.

00:05:39.081 --> 00:05:41.006
You can give realisations to others.

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:44.406
In your presence people get realisation

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:49.447
But you have to be that power completely.

00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:53.011
Supposing there’s something wrong with your car

00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.461
: But as long as it is moving

00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:56.601
it’s alright.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.176
You have to repair it.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:03.561
You have to repair all the time all our moods

00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:07.417
which we have caused ourselves by our foolishness

00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:10.892
by our lust, by our greed

00:06:11.202 --> 00:06:17.392
by so many false identifications we carried with ourselves.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:22.368
We must have a complete attention towards our weaknesses

00:06:22.488 --> 00:06:25.783
and not towards our achievements.

00:06:25.848 --> 00:06:28.033
If we know what are our weaknesses it’s better

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:33.109
that we can really swim across better.

00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:38.313
Supposing, on a ship there is a hole

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:42.353
and the water is coming in through that hole

00:06:42.698 --> 00:06:46.919
the attention of all the crew, of all the staff

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:53.589
and the captain itself will be on that hole from where the water is coming in, and nowhere else.

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.168
In the same way, you must be on the watch-out.

00:06:58.238 --> 00:07:03.308
There are so many pitfalls for a Sahaja Yogi – I have seen it.

00:07:03.828 --> 00:07:08.663
Of course, even the past is over

00:07:08.948 --> 00:07:11.359
even the past can be overcome.

00:07:11.638 --> 00:07:20.019
In the present also they have many shadows of the past working.

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:24.089
For example, when you are sitting in a group

00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:28.379
you are involved with each other.

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.459
Those who are involved with each other

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.864
by any relationship whatsoever

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:40.484
must know that this kind of involvement

00:07:40.684 --> 00:07:48.114
is not going to help them to attain their individual ascent.

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:54.514
Everybody is ascending individually though you are collectively contacted with each other

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.304
and in communication;

00:07:56.504 --> 00:07:59.334
but the ascendance is individual

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:01.370
absolutely individual.

00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:06.604
So whether he is your son, brother, sister, wife, friend

00:08:06.904 --> 00:08:13.334
you must remember that you are not responsible for their ascendance.

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:16.889
You cannot help them for their ascendance.

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:22.520
Only Mother’s Grace and their own desire

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.200
their own effort, to give up all that

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.965
is three dimensional will help them.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.875
So whenever a thought comes like that

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:42.515
you must know that you have not attained the thoughtless awareness in its full extent

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:44.905
and that’s how you have problems

00:08:45.105 --> 00:08:47.570
which are three-dimensional.

00:08:47.995 --> 00:08:50.430
Sometimes, a Sahaja Yogi will find

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.105
an emotion will come into his mind.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.015
It will be an emotion of dejection or frustration

00:08:57.215 --> 00:09:03.090
and he will be disgusted with himself or with others.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.560
Both things are just the same

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.031
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis get very disgusted with others.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.705
There should be no disgust that is lasting.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.030
Of course, for a short time

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.295
you might feel a disgust. It’s alright. It’s a passing phase

00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:21.971
Or you might feel disgusted with yourself –

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.350
may be a passing phase.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.195
But if you go on hankering on to it

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.675
or if you go on clinging to it

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:34.420
that means you are conditioning yourself

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.630
that means you are not in thoughtless awareness

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.215
that means that you are in your past

00:09:41.415 --> 00:09:46.521
you are making your past a solid mass on your head.

00:09:47.245 --> 00:09:50.140
In the present everything is fleeting.

00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:56.505
Everything is fleeting that is not eternal

00:09:56.585 --> 00:09:59.070
In the present the eternal stays

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.785
the rest all drops out

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.741
It’s like a moving river which doesn’t stop anywhere

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.011
But the moving river is eternal.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.590
The rest of the things are all changing.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.455
If you are on the Eternal Principle

00:10:14.965 --> 00:10:19.300
all that is not eternal changes

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.300
and drops out

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:26.720
dissolves and becomes nonexistent.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.240
We have to understand our own dignity

00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:34.849
our own essence.

00:10:34.959 --> 00:10:41.819
The first and foremost is that all the Sahaja Yogis are the chosen ones

00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:46.540
They are the people whom God has chosen

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:51.550
In this city of Delhi there are thousands and thousands of people.

00:10:51.964 --> 00:10:58.314
All over the world there are so many people that we are suffering from overpopulation

00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:03.135
but in Sahaja Yoga there are very, very few people.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.400
And when you are chosen

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.410
the first, you must also realise that you are the foundations.

00:11:14.765 --> 00:11:17.410
You are the stones that are to be laid down

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.605
and have to be strong

00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:26.941
have to be forbearing

00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:32.648
and that’s why it is necessary that all of you who are now few

00:11:32.883 --> 00:11:36.473
who are the first lamps

00:11:36.673 --> 00:11:41.058
that are going to enlighten other lamps in the world

00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:48.633
you have to enjoy the strength of eternity

00:11:48.893 --> 00:11:52.458
the strength of Divine Love

00:11:52.518 --> 00:11:56.183
the strength of this Universal Being that you are.

00:11:56.303 --> 00:11:58.508
This is what meditation is.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.828
So when Sahaja Yogis ask me:

00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:02.578
“What should we do for meditation?”

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.888
You be in thoughtless awareness that’s all

00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:09.098
Don’t do anything.

00:12:09.298 --> 00:12:16.688
At that time, not [only] that you are moving towards the goal

00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:21.038
or that the Unconscious is taking charge of you

00:12:21.288 --> 00:12:24.253
not only that, but also that you are emitting

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:26.343
for the first time

00:12:27.508 --> 00:12:31.373
the Divine into the nature

00:12:32.263 --> 00:12:35.028
into your surroundings

00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:37.163
into other people

00:12:37.363 --> 00:12:42.968
who are universally connected to you

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:49.124
Only thing is that we are used to one thing

00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:52.108
that is we must do something about it

00:12:52.323 --> 00:12:56.618
and so that’s why we start doing something

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:02.488
Meditation is the most Sahaja method.

00:13:03.397 --> 00:13:09.292
Then we have prayers and we have also puja.

00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:12.222
Prayers are also

00:13:12.422 --> 00:13:15.452
if said in your heart

00:13:15.832 --> 00:13:19.762
with the feeling of complete surrendering

00:13:19.977 --> 00:13:24.432
and asking for the Eternal

00:13:24.777 --> 00:13:27.147
it will be granted.

00:13:27.832 --> 00:13:38.767
Just ask for that and the rest will take [you] step-by-step.

00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:42.392
All the Sahaja Yogis have a problem.

00:13:42.632 --> 00:13:44.892
And they have problems because of their past

00:13:45.092 --> 00:13:48.928
because of their future aspirations.

00:13:49.582 --> 00:13:52.672
Now when you have problems

00:13:52.872 --> 00:13:56.958
in Sahaja Yoga you have learnt how to overcome them.

00:13:57.437 --> 00:14:02.772
There are so many methods other than meditation

00:14:03.347 --> 00:14:04.927
you know them very well that

00:14:05.137 --> 00:14:09.897
you must know what is the chakra where the Kundalini is.

00:14:10.497 --> 00:14:12.862
Now, if the Kundalini has been stopped

00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:17.012
by a certain chakra which is not working

00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:20.148
you shouldn’t get frustrated about it.

00:14:20.257 --> 00:14:27.037
Supposing your instrument or your car has stopped on the way

00:14:27.612 --> 00:14:30.317
what’s the use of getting frustrated with it?

00:14:30.517 --> 00:14:33.427
You have to learn the mechanism

00:14:33.732 --> 00:14:35.932
You have to be a good technician

00:14:35.982 --> 00:14:38.797
and then you can manage it very well

00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:44.508
So all the techniques of Sahaja Yoga must be learned and mastered

00:14:44.887 --> 00:14:47.017
This you can only do by giving it to others

00:14:47.217 --> 00:14:51.647
and learning from correcting them and correcting yourself.

00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:53.772
There is nothing to be frustrated.

00:14:53.972 --> 00:14:55.052
That’s the worst thing.

00:14:55.252 --> 00:14:56.532
If you get frustrated

00:14:56.732 --> 00:14:58.947
and unhappy with yourself

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.552
then there is going to be a problem.

00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:04.692
You have to laugh at yourself

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:09.747
and laugh at your mechanism that is out of gear

00:15:09.777 --> 00:15:14.378
When you start identifying yourself even with the instrument

00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:18.912
then you are not there

00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:21.158
You are not the chakras

00:15:21.382 --> 00:15:26.222
you are not the different channels

00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:29.658
You are the awareness

00:15:29.987 --> 00:15:33.788
you are the power, you are the Kundalini

00:15:34.337 --> 00:15:43.955
So you don’t have to worry about all these things being not in their proper conditions

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:47.500
If they are not, you can solve it.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.590
Just now the lights went off

00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:54.070
If the lights have went off because of the electricity failure

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.811
it’s a serious thing.

00:15:56.065 --> 00:15:59.845
But if the lights have gone out because there is a fused bulb

00:16:00.045 --> 00:16:03.630
oh, you can replace it, you can do all that.

00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:07.755
So there is no need to worry if your chakras are spoilt.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.160
Worrying itself, or frustrating yourself

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.460
itself is a wrong attitude towards Sahaja Yoga

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.025
‘Sahaja’, in other terminology also means

00:16:18.225 --> 00:16:20.875
is ‘a simple thing’.

00:16:21.075 --> 00:16:24.360
‘Sahaja’means to be Sahaja means in

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.380
I can say how Tulsidas (Kabir) has said:

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.540
“Jaise rakha hu taise hi rahu” [You keep me as you like].

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:38.480
That kind of an attitude takes your attention inside

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.661
because outside it is let alone , to the dogs;

00:16:42.695 --> 00:16:44.361
let alone

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.351
We are not bothered about the outside part.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.085
“As you keep me, I will be, in that manner”.

00:16:52.655 --> 00:16:57.651
And you will be surprised everything clicks out very well.

00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:00.706
Even, sometimes, you might feel:

00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:02.486
“I should reach a certain place”,

00:17:02.686 --> 00:17:05.406
“I must have this bhajan done”,

00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:06.996
“I must get these things done”

00:17:07.196 --> 00:17:09.166
and it’s not done sometimes.

00:17:10.081 --> 00:17:16.646
Sometimes by mistake something as you want is not done.

00:17:17.136 --> 00:17:21.591
You must accept it as the will of God.

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:28.064
That is what He desires. It’s alright.

00:17:28.469 --> 00:17:30.164
That is the desire of God

00:17:30.364 --> 00:17:33.099
and now you are one with His desire.

00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:38.309
You are here to communicate the desire of God to the whole world

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.969
and, at this stage

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:43.479
if you start having your own desires

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:46.574
and ideas about yourself

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:53.469
then, when will you become the desire of God?

00:17:57.564 --> 00:18:01.284
This ‘I-ness’ has to go away.

00:18:02.134 --> 00:18:04.884
That is what meditation is.

00:18:05.144 --> 00:18:11.004
Where you are no more ‘I’ but it is ‘You’.

00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:14.634
Kabirdasji has written a beautiful poem about it

00:18:14.979 --> 00:18:20.904
that, when the goat is living and [kicking?],

00:18:21.104 --> 00:18:24.189
she says: “Mai, mai”, that is “I, I”.

00:18:24.719 --> 00:18:29.224
But then she dies

00:18:30.369 --> 00:18:35.434
and her intestines are drawn out into wires

00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:40.569
and some saint fixes them on the “tutari”,

00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:42.589
that instrument that they have

00:18:42.804 --> 00:18:45.624
ektari [one string] as they call it.

00:18:45.954 --> 00:18:49.184
And he goes on pulling it with his fingers

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:53.634
then it says: “Tuhi, Tuhi, Tuhi,”

00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:57.969
that is: “You are, You are, You are”.

00:18:58.974 --> 00:19:02.219
That is how we have to die

00:19:02.544 --> 00:19:05.264
and we have to be resurrected.

00:19:05.884 --> 00:19:08.389
You have been already

00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:12.189
but Sahaja yoga as I have told you

00:19:12.714 --> 00:19:15.872
is a kheer [Indian milk sweet],

00:19:15.979 --> 00:19:17.252
or what you call

00:19:17.272 --> 00:19:21.474
the sweet dish cooked in a raw pot:

00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:24.279
“Kachche ghade ki kheer hai [kheer cooked in clay pot].

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:31.499
So the soil of the raw pot also is mixed up.

00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:38.094
But your attention can be with the kheer, with the milk

00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:46.019
and can drop out all that is the mud of the raw pot.

00:19:46.824 --> 00:19:49.874
That discrimination is spontaneous.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:51.834
It is there.

00:19:52.034 --> 00:19:55.884
You have got it: self-actualisation.

00:19:56.084 --> 00:19:57.334
You can feel yourself.

00:19:57.534 --> 00:19:59.074
You know you are not that.

00:19:59.274 --> 00:20:04.434
You have started talking about your chakras in the same manner.

00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:07.869
But the only thing

00:20:08.234 --> 00:20:11.199
the only problem, or the only defect

00:20:11.579 --> 00:20:14.029
that is with the Sahaja yogi is

00:20:14.329 --> 00:20:18.374
that, still, though he is there

00:20:18.472 --> 00:20:23.949
his attention is involved with outside.

00:20:24.032 --> 00:20:27.617
That’s the only defect.

00:20:28.387 --> 00:20:30.207
If the attention is removed…

00:20:30.492 --> 00:20:32.782
how to remove? That’s the point.

00:20:33.172 --> 00:20:34.347
That is the first thing.

00:20:34.547 --> 00:20:35.647
Once you say, “how to remove?”

00:20:35.847 --> 00:20:40.362
means you have created the three-dimensional involvement.

00:20:40.902 --> 00:20:47.157
You are not to remove. It is [already] there!

00:20:50.037 --> 00:20:52.667
If your attention is outside

00:20:54.612 --> 00:20:56.952
then I would have said: “No, your attention has to go inside

00:20:57.152 --> 00:20:58.552
It has not got yet.”

00:20:58.752 --> 00:21:00.442
But it is there. You are sitting there.

00:21:00.642 --> 00:21:01.927
I am sitting here.

00:21:02.307 --> 00:21:05.217
But my attention is outside.

00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:10.097
I have to just feel myself where I am, that’s all.

00:21:11.157 --> 00:21:12.877
Some have felt it

00:21:13.082 --> 00:21:14.877
some have achieved it.

00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:16.572
You know among yourselves

00:21:16.772 --> 00:21:21.337
there are some who have gone very high up.

00:21:22.362 --> 00:21:26.242
The other method we employ is of puja.

00:21:26.727 --> 00:21:30.122
I’ve found that works very well with human beings – puja –

00:21:30.612 --> 00:21:37.932
because it satisfies lots of demands of the past habits

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:42.395
that you feel that you are doing something about it.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:51.810
Then you start giving whatever you think God has given you – the blessings.

00:21:52.235 --> 00:21:54.340
And the Rishi and Muni have found out

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.850
they’re very clever people

00:21:57.295 --> 00:22:01.120
they have found out how to please the Deities

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.021
how to please the Mother.

00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:04.405
So they have told you

00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:08.685
as they have told you even in this lifetime of mine

00:22:08.885 --> 00:22:10.470
how to please Her.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.535
They say She is Stutipriya

00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:14.470
that means ‘She likes praises’.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:15.650
It’s not that.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:21.260
But when you praise someone from the heart

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.825
that means you are accepting it

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:32.755
and that is the time the chakras start creating a force by which you are thrown

00:22:32.965 --> 00:22:40.070
you are triggered, into that realm of God.

00:22:40.165 --> 00:22:46.505
So these puja methods and prayer methods and the mantra methods

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:52.200
have been devised and found out by great thinkers of Sahaja Yoga

00:22:52.575 --> 00:22:55.465
the great masters of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:55.705 --> 00:22:59.845
And it is the effort

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:02.950
or you can say the effortless effort

00:23:03.255 --> 00:23:11.890
of the Sahaja yogis that makes my body vibrate

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.180
extracts the essence from my body, I should say.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:23.210
They make, it makes, the Infinite release Itself through this finite being.

00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:27.790
And it works, it clicks, I have seen it, it works out very well.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.360
But you know that, after puja

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.420
I get little tired

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.005
because, if you cannot receive it, that Force

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.895
I want to sleep

00:23:39.095 --> 00:23:52.130
and get rid of that additional vibrations into “sushupti” [deep sleep] by entering into the Infinite State.

00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:55.625
If you could receive whatever I am emitting

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.945
in balance, with your puja

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.145
then only it helps better.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.210
That means, when you are doing puja also, receive it.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.575
Be in thoughtless awareness when you are doing puja

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:17.215
completely concentrated in receiving.

00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:20.200
But while [doing] puja people are talking.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.175
I’ve seen that they’re moving about. I mean, I don’t know how to explain it!

00:24:24.595 --> 00:24:27.595
That’s the time something is oozing out, the nectar

00:24:27.625 --> 00:24:31.150
and you just receive it at that time with full devotion.

00:24:31.214 --> 00:24:32.569
It is oozing out.

00:24:32.769 --> 00:24:35.919
If you feel my vibrations of my chakras at that time

00:24:36.119 --> 00:24:37.619
you will realise

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:39.799
that even the minute, small little

00:24:39.889 --> 00:24:44.224
wheels in my body are moving at different spaces

00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:47.814
at different speed

00:24:48.094 --> 00:24:51.404
at different dimension.

00:24:51.774 --> 00:24:55.954
And I really don’t know how to explain! But, you see, it creates a melody.

00:24:56.844 --> 00:25:02.349
You have to receive it and it is a melody individually

00:25:03.044 --> 00:25:05.884
suitable for every individual.

00:25:06.469 --> 00:25:08.780
And when you receive it

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.510
it triggers in you that state of infinity.

00:25:14.415 --> 00:25:16.870
So at the time of puja

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:24.150
you must know that all your attention should be in reception.

00:25:25.485 --> 00:25:30.320
Today is a very great day with the New Year.

00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:33.740
Within two years from today

00:25:34.485 --> 00:25:38.205
Satya Yuga is going to start.

00:25:39.785 --> 00:25:43.665
It’s a great day for many things

00:25:43.895 --> 00:25:47.835
that nine days are celebrated after this

00:25:48.035 --> 00:25:51.270
for the advent of Mother.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.430
It is the date

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.760
or I should say, the calendar was started by my forefathers

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.935
and they perceived

00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:12.605
that this is the day when the Mother started creating.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:16.915
And this is the day She created Ganesha to begin with.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.965
In the Utpatti stage [first stage, Genesis],

00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:24.525
She started her work this day.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:34.370
And that’s why they put this date as the first date

00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:41.680
because the time started from this date long time back.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.625
And that’s why this date is very important

00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:50.760
and if you cross this date then you are beyond time.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.125
You have to step on to this date and go beyond.

00:26:57.655 --> 00:27:00.310
You have to step on your dharma

00:27:00.595 --> 00:27:05.330
on to your religion, and go beyond : ‘dharmateet’.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.485
You have to be those three gunas

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.900
and to go beyond : ‘gunateet’.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.930
You are all those three.

00:27:19.685 --> 00:27:23.725
But the steps on which you are standing have to be all right

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.385
or those which are crossed or, have to be all right too.

00:27:27.475 --> 00:27:29.030
So when you are beyond

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:34.820
you have to repair those steps, which you have crossed somehow

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:41.788
which can be done through meditation, puja, prayers.

00:27:42.678 --> 00:27:45.028
But the most important

00:27:45.298 --> 00:27:47.993
the greatest advancement is done

00:27:48.193 --> 00:27:54.978
by giving the universal through your universal being.

00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:59.706
You all must dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga

00:28:00.256 --> 00:28:01.601
and give more and more.

00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:03.741
Among us there are some people

00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:06.821
who have given a lot

00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:11.321
and by that they have achieved a lot too.

00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:14.886
You have to give, talk about it, spread it

00:28:15.086 --> 00:28:18.771
and bring more people to get this.

00:28:19.286 --> 00:28:23.876
Otherwise they will be left out of evolutionary processes.

00:28:24.401 --> 00:28:26.991
There’s no time for you to doubt and think;

00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:30.961
don’t waste your time in all these useless activities.

00:28:31.341 --> 00:28:35.636
If you have still doubts, it’s better to give up.

00:28:35.986 --> 00:28:43.731
It’s high time that you get into the process.

00:28:45.626 --> 00:29:00.921
So today I wish you happy New Year for a journey in the spiritual life of this world.

00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:04.851
You have to think of all the Sahaja Yogis

00:29:04.912 --> 00:29:11.272
who are far away from us

00:29:12.727 --> 00:29:20.107
and our thoughts should carry our love for them

00:29:20.482 --> 00:29:28.275
and they should be blessed as you all are blessed here.

00:29:28.395 --> 00:29:31.675
I hope these important days that I am here

00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:34.940
you will fully dedicate yourself

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.600
for your emancipation on those four lines

00:29:40.885 --> 00:29:42.595
that I have told you.

00:29:43.135 --> 00:29:46.680
And whatever program comes in, take it sahaj.

00:29:47.275 --> 00:29:51.055
You should not insist on times and timings.

00:29:51.255 --> 00:29:54.095
Whatever comes sahaaj, accept it.

00:29:54.615 --> 00:29:58.065
May God bless you.
