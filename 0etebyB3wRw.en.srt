Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella (Italy), 30 August 1992.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,160
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

4
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,217
and you should know that the essence of Guru

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,000
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,280
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,600
faithful wife, of a sati.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,040
Her name was Anasuya,

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,440
and she was so religious

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,200
and so dedicated

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,760
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

13
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:32,567
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,880
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,120
So all of them came down as sadhus,

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,080
dressed up like sanyasis.

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,920
And she said she wanted to serve them,

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,320
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,800
She cooked food for them.

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,320
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,720
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,120
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,760
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,040
and then she became nude,

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,080
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
And then she joined them together,

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,920
their three innocences were joined together

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,000
and they got their Gurupada.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,000
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,280
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,120
you have to be innocent.

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,440
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

35
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,320
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,000
But what is the nature of innocence?

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,760
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,800
First of all

39
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,040
He's endowed with wisdom,

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,880
and He puts wisdom into us.

41
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,920
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,400
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

43
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,520
It is He who puts genetics in us.

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,480
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

45
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,600
and when He puts wisdom in us,

46
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,440
then we are wise.

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,000
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,920
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
They have no wisdom.

50
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,400
They do things without wisdom.

51
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,920
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,560
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,000
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

54
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,480
but you can see from their behavior they're,

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,400
that they have no wisdom at all.

56
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,720
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

57
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,760
In some people who are not yet evolved,

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,800
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

59
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,400
this wisdom is lacking.

60
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,560
Apart from that,

61
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,160
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

62
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,560
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,760
all kinds of bad habits.

64
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,200
We don't like to look at nudity.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,720
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

66
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,000
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,480
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

68
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,840
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,000
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,760
We are automatically dharmic.

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,920
We don't kill others,

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,040
we don't aggress others,

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,320
we don't torture others.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,800
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,640
or take away anything,

76
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,080
another's property or another's things.

77
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,480
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,760
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

79
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,120
It is He only ultimately

80
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,200
who looks after us

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,120
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

82
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,600
because

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,800
He stops all other activities of excretion

84
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:13,200
when you are ascending into new realm.

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,400
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

87
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,920
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,560
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

89
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,680
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

90
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,160
So this wisdom is innate,

91
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,560
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

92
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,280
He becomes, manifesting in us -

93
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,080
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

94
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,800
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

95
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,080
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,000
You become the child,

97
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,800
at that time you become a child.

98
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,040
And with the kundalini rising,

99
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,760
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

100
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,009
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

101
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:20,240
He's the power in the kundalini.

102
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,280
He gives wisdom in the brain.

103
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,640
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

104
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,240
all your attachments which are wrong,

105
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,240
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

106
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,760
He changes, your genetics are changed.

107
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,680
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

108
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,240
about the same I would say,

109
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,680
and the genetics of other people would be different.

110
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,880
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

111
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
because Indians normally are very wise people.

112
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,952
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

113
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:08,160
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

114
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,840
Indians are very wise.

115
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,560
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

116
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,040
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

117
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,680
when they go to India: they went for this school,

118
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,678
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

119
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,479
nobody could understand.

120
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,280
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

121
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,920
They got malaria.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

123
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,240
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

124
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,120
So they put a gate.

125
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,280
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

126
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,480
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

127
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,040
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

128
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,800
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
he understands the importance of his life.

130
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,200
He respects his parents, he respects everything

131
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,920
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

132
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,800
Automatically they know what is dharma is, you don't have to tell them.

133
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,560
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

134
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,360
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

135
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,800
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,000
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

137
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,640
so much developed in these Western countries,

138
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,320
people took to stupid things.

139
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,840
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

140
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,360
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

141
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,800
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,752
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

143
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:00,600
they have no Ganesha.

144
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,040
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

145
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,480
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

146
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,920
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

147
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Before that you just call "holy father",

148
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,880
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

149
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,360
which can create holes in the organization;

150
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,240
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

151
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,040
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
So this wisdom part is so important,

153
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,990
and that's what we should ask

154
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,360
Ganesha, to make us like children.

155
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,120
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

156
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,480
This is the thing is,

157
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,600
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

158
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,640
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

159
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,160
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

160
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,440
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

161
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,640
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

162
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,479
because there's no strength from within.

163
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,119
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

164
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,039
Now you know yourself,

165
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,559
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

166
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,840
they behave differently, they stand differently,

167
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,674
they talk differently, they think differently, they

168
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:28,280
- everything is different.

169
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,160
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

170
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,200
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

171
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,640
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

172
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,000
everything they did.

173
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
But how is it suddenly you changed?

174
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:50,000
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.

175
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,640
Now if you see His character, it's very interesting to watch.

176
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,680
He's a child, and He's entirely dedicated to His Mother.

177
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,480
He doesn't know any other god, anything else -- complete dedication.

178
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
But is it so with us?

179
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,240
There also sometimes I find some of the Sahaja Yogis are lacking.

180
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,280
They lack sincerity, loyalties.

181
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,800
And I'm shocked sometimes at the periphery they are like that;

182
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,480
that means they have to ascend still.

183
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,240
People who have worked with Me,

184
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,880
I have always tried to pay them sufficiently.

185
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,680
There's no need to pay,

186
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,000
because after all I have done so much for your building,

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,000
your body, why should I pay you?

188
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,920
But I always pay sumptuously,

189
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,800
I look after them, give them ...

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,920
My, My loyalties to you and love cannot be challenged.

191
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,800
But I find them, them being very selfish sometimes,

192
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,360
extremely selfish.

193
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
They'll do half the work and run away, sometimes they are ....

194
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,400
their problems, their own problems are much more important.

195
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,280
Or they just try to find some excuse.

196
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,760
So many Sahaja Yogis are also like that.

197
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,600
They are not sincere.

198
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,280
Sahaja Yoga has given them so much.

199
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,920
We have to always find out, are we sincere to Sahaja Yoga?

200
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,680
What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

201
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,160
What have we achieved and what are we doing?

202
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,920
On the contrary, they become liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

203
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,640
Ganesha is never a liability on His Mother.

204
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,200
For example, someone becomes sick.

205
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,920
All right, Sahaja Yoga can help you -

206
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,760
may be, may not be; may be cured, may not be cured.

207
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,920
If they are not cured then they will say that "See now,

208
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,080
I was not cured. I'm going to leave Sahaja Yoga."

209
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,800
Then one has to say, "Please leave."

210
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,080
With the slightest thing they go off, not understanding

211
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,760
what is important.

212
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,200
Then they are liabilities, like somebody gets married,

213
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,800
comes here, "I don't like this wife." Now do what you like,

214
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,160
the wife sits on My head, and the husband also.

215
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,680
All kinds of liabilities come in,

216
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,440
"My husband doesn't do Sahaja Yoga, what should I do?"

217
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,400
You solve the problem with your husband.

218
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
You solve the problem with your children.

219
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,600
You have the power to do it; have patience, work it out.

220
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,920
They'll put us into cases, this, that.

221
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
It is only Sahaja Yogis who can harm Sahaja Yoga,

222
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,920
can you believe that?

223
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,080
Nobody else can touch it.

224
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,560
Unless and until a Sahaja Yogi misbehaves,

225
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,080
nobody can touch Sahaja Yoga.

226
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,400
So we have many cases like that.

227
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,160
I mean, they have seen My photographs,

228
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,120
they have seen miraculous photographs,

229
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,560
they have had realization, everything happened to them,

230
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,320
they have been so many times helped.

231
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,880
But suddenly they say, "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga."

232
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
"Very good," I say,

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,320
"those who have to leave should leave immediately."

234
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,480
As it is there's very little space left in the Heaven,

235
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,280
and no place for such half-hearted people.

236
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,680
If they have to leave, they should leave.

237
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
You have to have Ganesha as your ideal.

238
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,787
It should not be that "I worship Ganesha."

239
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,958
That way you were worshipping Christ,

240
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,079
you were worshipping this, worshipping that.

241
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,560
But what has come inside you, is the point.

242
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
Have you got Shri Ganesha within you?

243
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,560
Are you following Shri Ganesha with the same devotion, dedication?

244
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,920
If you ... But you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

245
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,240
Shri Ganesha was made with immaculate conception.

246
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,120
You are also made the same way.

247
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,360
Your kundalini was raised, was given you the realization

248
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,880
and you got your second birth, and now you are Sahaja yogis.

249
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,480
All these things have happened to you

250
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,800
without having a father.

251
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,560
If I had not told you that you have a Father,

252
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,920
you would never have known.

253
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,720
Like, other gurus, you see,

254
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,000
they don't want to give credit to anyone.

255
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,920
So this actually has happened with you,

256
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,159
you are being made in the same manner as Shri Ganesh.

257
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,879
Of course you must be having something, you know,

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,560
otherwise I could not have made -- that's also true.

259
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,120
Supposing the kundalini was missing, now what could I have done?

260
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,120
If not missing, if it was absolutely crooked;

261
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,280
if not crooked,

262
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,520
supposing there were some chakras which were horribly damaged.

263
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,200
So, you were also people just ready to have your realization,

264
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,480
that you were seeking it truly,

265
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,720
that you had the pure desire to become Sahaja Yogis, no doubt.

266
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,520
Still, when the growth is taking place,

267
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,720
you must watch,

268
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,520
you must see how much sincerity we are giving,

269
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,720
with what dedication we are working out?

270
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,600
Now, we have people

271
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,400
who must have gone for postering somewhere, some places

272
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,400
- not now, it's long time back -

273
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,160
so they charged Me for their coffee also.

274
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,560
I said, "All right." Thank God they were not smoking,

275
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,520
otherwise they would have charged Me!

276
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,600
So from that level, now we are very much changed,

277
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,600
and some of them have become perfect Sahaja Yogis.

278
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,080
But still we have people on the periphery,

279
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,640
and they get nervous at the smallest thing.

280
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
Yesterday there was a storm - has to be a storm.

281
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,320
You don't know,

282
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,280
when Christ was carrying His disciples there was a very big storm,

283
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,720
and then He stopped it.

284
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,240
Yesterday when you started singing the songs,

285
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,160
then only the storm stopped,

286
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
just to prove that these songs have such power.

287
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,999
If such things don't happen,

288
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,048
how will you know that these songs have the power?

289
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:44,245
You think you are just singing just because you are singing.

290
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,697
No, it has a power, these are mantras, these are

291
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,149
all awakened songs.

292
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,800
And then it stopped.

293
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,200
They were saying, "Should we say mantras?" I said,

294
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,879
"No, nothing." I didn't say things, what you have to do.

295
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Suddenly they thought of singing,

296
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,720
and then it worked out.

297
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,640
Because every time if I have to suggest,

298
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,280
then when will you use your power?

299
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,120
All such incidents take place,

300
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
now it was Shri Ganesha's special trick.

301
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,262
He's the real judge for you.

302
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,000
You must know because you have seen in Sistine Chapel,

303
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,800
He is standing there and moving you left and right.

304
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,880
So there is a testing point also.

305
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,120
In Sahaja Yoga the door is open, this way.

306
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,800
But there's a bigger door on the back side

307
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,880
to throw out people.

308
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,880
And the judgment is not done by Me so much as by this Ganesha.

309
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,360
He judges you, and then you are thrown out.

310
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,520
Then to come back is very difficult.

311
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,520
Even if you come back you are suspicious of yourself,

312
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,000
and others are also suspicious of you.

313
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,600
So you see, what you have to understand

314
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,360
is that this is a judgment point.

315
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,280
Introspect yourself, find out,

316
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,920
"Am I wise? If I'm doing this, am I doing wise things?

317
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,680
Is it wise for me to do?

318
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,640
Is it all right for me as a Sahaja Yogi to do it?

319
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,320
Should I do it or not?"

320
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,480
At every point you should see.

321
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,360
I mean, you know that I don't want any money,

322
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:28,038
and I don't want any presents -- I've said hundred times,

323
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,279
but they won't listen.

324
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,273
Now they are saying that

325
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:32,747
"Mother if you stop giving us present, we'll stop."

326
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:35,679
I said, "You stop first, then I'll stop."

327
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,920
But despite all this quarrel and fight,

328
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,556
there's one thing definitely:

329
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:43,437
there's love, and you want to express it.

330
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,640
But love here is not attached;

331
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,160
it's detached love, where it flows to its greatest extent,

332
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,160
takes all the responsibility.

333
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,000
There is people, there are people

334
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,520
who go on criticizing other Sahaja Yogis

335
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,440
-- I have seen it, it's very common.

336
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,440
That's a sign of a very low type of a Sahaja Yogi,

337
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,000
because he doesn't see what's wrong with him.

338
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
He's trying to criticize others,

339
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,920
does he see what is wrong with him?

340
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,760
There are other kinds of Sahaja Yogis

341
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,920
who do not realize that they are like ganas.

342
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,400
They are like ganas, and imagine the ganas, how quick they are.

343
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,480
The Ganesha is creating those ganas,

344
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,560
and they are in the sternum bones first,

345
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,040
and then they go all over the body.

346
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,880
As soon as this Center Heart, the Mother's place,

347
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,840
starts little bit vibrating, they get alerted.

348
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,600
So we have to be alert.

349
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,400
It's very important that we have to be alert.

350
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,480
For about twelve years of your age

351
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,600
these ganas stay there in the sternum bone,

352
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,960
and then they go to the whole body,

353
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,639
because they are matured enough.

354
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,276
They are kept there till they are completely matured

355
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,160
to fight the enemies.

356
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,440
And they know what kind of enemies they have, they know everything:

357
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,920
what kind of fighting is needed, what kind of opposition is there.

358
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,680
They will just select and they will appoint themselves,

359
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,560
who should fight whom, who should do this.

360
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,920
But they just don't sit all the time in the Mother's house.

361
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,560
So we have to go to the people.

362
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,120
We have to go into the Virata's body.

363
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,240
We have to move out, we have to go all out;

364
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,920
without having any fear you have to fight them.

365
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,168
Not to sit at home crying like a baby,

366
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:56,640
now you are all grown-up people.

367
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,760
So this is what is written in the Buddha's future life,

368
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,920
that He becomes Matreya, means He has three Mothers in Him

369
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,240
"Ma treya."

370
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,760
But also that He goes all out in the society,

371
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,920
He goes out everywhere and He changes people.

372
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,280
When you asked for Gurupada you don't know, you were in trouble.

373
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,360
Guru doesn't sit at home.

374
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,560
He has to go all out, meet all kinds of people,

375
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,160
tell them about Sahaja Yoga; not to be afraid.

376
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,025
You have to live in the society,

377
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,430
you don't have to have exclusive society

378
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:44,360
where we enjoy bhajans and things - that's over now.

379
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,920
I mean, of course we'll always have bhajans, it doesn't mean that.

380
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,400
But you have to go beyond.

381
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,560
Not only to be involved only in your own problems

382
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,160
which are being now solved, so only in Sahaja Yoga,but Sahaja Yogis;

383
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,480
but you have to go all out,

384
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,160
meet other people,

385
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,760
tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

386
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,920
The best is to wear badges so people ask, "Who is this?"

387
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,400
- then you can talk to them, your friends, your society.

388
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,560
You don't have to give up anything,

389
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,000
don't have to give up anything.

390
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,562
You are detached, you just go and see for yourself, this is wrong.

391
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:27,997
Like yesterday they showed all kinds of things,

392
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,040
also disco dance they showed you.

393
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,080
You should go to the disco and give them the pamphlets,

394
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,200
show them, "What are you doing, are you mad?"¨

395
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,240
Or do this kind of a disco more there

396
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,400
so they'll say, "What's wrong with them?"

397
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Then you say, "We are copying you."

398
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,785
That will put them down.

399
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,600
You see a lady who is, say, smoking and this and that,

400
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,478
standing with a pose - go and stand before her with a pose

401
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,199
and smoking like this.

402
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,160
She'll stop it.

403
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,600
So by copying them, one way,

404
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,920
showing them what they are - another, writing.

405
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,520
You must have writing.

406
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
It's very important to write and answer.

407
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,840
I must tell that there's a very nice article

408
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,640
which has come now with Me,

409
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:23,153
and the English Sahaja Yogis should take it from Me

410
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:25,074
and answer the gentleman.

411
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:29,120
It's very important. It's in My room, I'll give them.

412
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
You must know what's happening all around -

413
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,320
what's happening in Bosnia,

414
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,920
what's happening in Italy, what's happening here.

415
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
You should read newspapers.

416
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,920
You can see television also,

417
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,840
when - and now, when you are matured.

418
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,680
Otherwise if you see television,

419
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,640
you'll go mad like other television people are.

420
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,600
So what's the use of seeing the television?

421
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
But if you see the television with a detached mind,

422
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,480
you'll immediately get the point where you have to hit.

423
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,680
Otherwise you are sitting in the house nicely covered up,

424
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,080
"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother." That's not so.

425
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Ganesha gives powers to these ganas and they fight.

426
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,640
That's why He's called as Ganapati.

427
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
If you want to call Me Ganapati,

428
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,840
then you have to be like ganas

429
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,280
who go all out, and work it out.

430
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,560
In so many ways, there's so many tricks

431
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:38,438
which you can play on these people

432
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
and try to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

433
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,560
And with you is this all-pervading Power.

434
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,120
You should not shun them.

435
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,520
For example, laws of your countries are so horrible,

436
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,120
some of the laws are so horrible, the peculiar type.

437
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,040
You should write.

438
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,120
There's no equity, there's no sense in so many laws that you have,

439
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,560
which are money-oriented

440
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,040
- say, in France they have very, very funny laws.

441
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,720
And they never maintain the law, they don't believe in it.

442
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,080
There's no morals, there are no laws. You write to them.

443
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,560
You must go and see newspaper people, tell them about it.

444
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,440
Try to now assert yourself.

445
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,080
Unless and until you do that,

446
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,000
nobody is going to get to Sahaja Yoga.

447
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
You might get very great people out of that.

448
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,560
You can invite some people, you can call them.

449
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,880
The modus operandi of these gurus I have seen.

450
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,920
They write very nice letters to all these big, big johnnies,

451
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,080
as soon as they go to some house.

452
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,880
Then they seek interview, go and see that person, talk to him.

453
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,320
They carry, you see, a sort of a -

454
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,280
you can say a kind of a

455
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,360
negotiations, you can call it,

456
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,480
or a some sort of a panel will go and see them.

457
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,000
It's all that level. And then they show them books.

458
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,440
"See now this is happening, why don't you take to it?

459
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,480
We don't want money,"  this thing, that thing.

460
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,140
You might get lots of people. But you have to invite them,

461
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:21,559
because unless and until you invite them, they'll not come to you.

462
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,640
So you have to invite them, and you have to tell them

463
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,880
that "We want to meet you. This is it."

464
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,320
Out of at least hundred, if not, at least twenty will reply.

465
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:33,449
They would like to meet you. You should say:

466
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,359
"We found out this, we found out that."

467
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,120
So now today as Ganesha's ganas

468
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,520
you have to do this special work,

469
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,440
is to understand now you are matured enough,

470
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,840
you have to go in the society.

471
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,320
Now if you get upset,

472
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:51,292
"Mother, I went there and this happened and that happened."

473
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,520
It doesn't matter.

474
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,560
You are not going to be crucified,

475
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,640
you are not going to be murdered.

476
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,040
And do you know there's all the time My protection on you?

477
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,680
If you want you can see a photograph we have,

478
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,440
with, ah, him, you can see that, complete protection.

479
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,600
It follows you, you have seen light on your heads.

480
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,174
You are the marked people, who are going -

481
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:18,160
you are already sitting in the Kingdom of God.

482
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,280
Why should you be afraid?

483
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,080
Why should you not meet people?

484
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,920
Then also I said, make some music.

485
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,359
Like yesterday's, I liked the way they were singing.

486
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,935
At least, you see, whatever they were singing,

487
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:37,600
may not be pop music sort or something, but it was clear.

488
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,600
The message should be clear - you can use pop style, doesn't matter -

489
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,280
but the message should be clear, it should not be

490
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,240
- I can never understand what they are singing.

491
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,160
So every word should be clear-cut.

492
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,000
We can go all out to have real publicity,

493
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,600
but for that we need people who are really matured enough.

494
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,840
Otherwise with the slightest provocation

495
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,000
they get upset, start fighting - finished.

496
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,280
Also we should not say

497
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,000
that "You are intellectual, you cannot understand."

498
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
You say "You can, mentally also you can understand,

499
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,840
we can explain to you." Prepare yourself.

500
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,320
We can even have some sort of seminars or classes

501
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,840
where we can discuss about these things.

502
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,560
In the pujas you can have some sort of a

503
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,880
- morning time is always free -

504
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,680
some sort of a seminar or a discussion,

505
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,720
or they call a brain trust or whatever it is.

506
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,604
And there you can discuss things,

507
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:38,045
how we can proceed, what we can do.

508
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,680
Now the time has come. It's over now,

509
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,320
all this preparation is over, you are prepared for it.

510
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,600
Now you have to go all out, tell people.

511
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,360
You know these people from this Brahmakumari what they tell,

512
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
"Now the doomsday has come.

513
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,360
You are all going to be doomed" - openly -

514
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,240
"and so that you give us money, you'll be saved."

515
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,440
So now you have to say that "This is the last judgment.

516
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,080
You take your realization, otherwise you'll be doomed."

517
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,880
Unless and until you take your realization,

518
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,640
without your ascent you cannot get out of your genetic problems.

519
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,080
All these genetic problems can be only solved

520
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,920
if you get your realization.

521
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,800
So you have to tell others, "Get out of your personal problems."

522
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,520
"Mother, my wife has no children." It doesn't matter.

523
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,480
There are so many children in this world,

524
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,680
you are doing a good work by not having a child.

525
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,760
And if you want to have a child, you can adopt a child.

526
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,480
Then, "My child is like this, my child is like that, my child ..."

527
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,320
So much attachment to children I've never seen.

528
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,840
Before marriage

529
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,160
if they have children, I've seen people treat them better.

530
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,709
But if they are married, they kill their children.

531
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,479
So many people kill their children,

532
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,720
abuse their children, do all kinds of things.

533
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,000
But once they are Sahaja Yogis they,

534
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,920
from this end to that end, they just get glued to their children.

535
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,720
So there should be a detached attitude towards everything,

536
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,840
and no attachments. Then only you'll be free.

537
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,880
But that doesn't mean that you are not doing your duty,

538
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,440
your nourishment that is needed.

539
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
You have to give love to everyone,

540
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
you have to care for everyone,

541
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,120
but you shouldn't get attached.

542
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,200
I have seen people, they get attached even to Sahaja yogis.

543
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,920
One Sahaja yogi misbehaved and went out of the Sahaja Yoga,

544
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,000
ten Sahaja Yogis went away with him.

545
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,080
They are not attached to Me but to that stupid Sahaja Yogi.

546
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,800
He went to Nepal, he learnt some avidya,

547
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,680
he came back, and they went away with him.

548
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,640
That shows you have not developed your personality.

549
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,360
How dare anybody influence you and say that get out of Sahaja Yoga!

550
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,280
If you have a matured personality and responsibility, you will say

551
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,120
"I have to do Sahaja Yoga work. That's the main thing I have to do."

552
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,120
You must know that though you look ordinary people,

553
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,480
but God has chosen you.

554
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,480
If any one of you do not do Sahaja Yoga work, who will be blamed?

555
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,240
In every aspect of life one should understand.

556
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:36,120
You see, I don't say that you give Me money or anything,

557
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,635
I don't want anything from you;

558
00:34:37,756 --> 00:34:39,716
as it is you know how much I am spending.

559
00:34:39,837 --> 00:34:42,640
But definitely if money is needed somewhere,

560
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,840
you must go all out to help with money also.

561
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,760
People will, they spend money in, say, races

562
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,840
or spend money on some sort of a pub.

563
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,880
All that money is saved now,

564
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,320
you don't have to go to a pub, nothing.

565
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,760
So if money is needed, you have to spend.

566
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
Then another thing is, people just start asking

567
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,760
why it's so expensive, why this, why that?

568
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,520
In Sahaja Yoga everybody knows accounts, everybody has accounts,

569
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,680
there's nothing secret - where money goes, what we are using for.

570
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
How do you have this, say, tent?

571
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,040
How do you have this land?

572
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,400
How do you have Daglio?

573
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:32,318
Just think, and nobody thinks like that,

574
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:35,559
from where Mother gets money to do all this things?

575
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,760
I don't need such a big castle, do I - for what?

576
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,360
I've already bought another house in London from My own money. Why?

577
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,760
It's already you have spent so much money for this Shudy Camp.

578
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,680
It's giving no money at all.

579
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,360
Well, I don't need Sahaja Yoga, it is you people who need it.

580
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,840
And if you start saving money on that also,

581
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,040
then I don't know what to say to you.

582
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,520
It doesn't mean like

583
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:09,603
in the church they say you must give money and all that,

584
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:13,244
but your dedication.

585
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,440
If you have the dedication

586
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,640
then you will yourself think, that is my responsibility.

587
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,482
On the contrary, you'll say, "Oh, you need money? All right."

588
00:36:23,603 --> 00:36:25,438
Now school has to be built.

589
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,119
Who has built Vashi?

590
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
Who has built this Ganapatipule?

591
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,240
Who has built such a big ashram now you'll see in Delhi?

592
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,280
Who has donated money for Sahaja Yoga so far?

593
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,880
You all have prospered in life,

594
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,440
you all have got sufficient money,

595
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,120
but what are you doing?

596
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,920
So in this aspect is,

597
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,680
you have to see that you do your level best for Sahaja Yoga.

598
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,760
Another side is your creativity.

599
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,120
There have been very great artists who came out of Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
If they have to give any present

601
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,040
they'll give the smallest possible, the cheapest possible.

602
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,560
The most expensive one they keep with themselves and sell it.

603
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,760
If they could give even one piece like that

604
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,760
we can sell it in the market, just for Sahaja Yoga.

605
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,280
But they'll give something very cheapish which cannot be used;

606
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,920
it's just adding up to My personal archives.

607
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
But if they give something sensible it can be sold.

608
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,840
The musicians who go abroad, they can give some,

609
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,000
their programs and things can make some money.

610
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,240
And also if it is needed, that money can be used.

611
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,160
Do you know we, I just asked once

612
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,680
that collect some money for Indian project,

613
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
one year, in Sahasrara.

614
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
You must know that,

615
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,080
that there were only five thousand pounds collected,

616
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,840
and I was so ashamed that they are still there as it is,

617
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
in the bank.

618
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,000
How can you send five thousand to India?

619
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,240
What will they think of you?

620
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,920
Even the school for you, it is for your children,

621
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,640
not for Indian children.

622
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,400
But still it will be built by Indians, I know that -- or by Me.

623
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,560
Thus we should realize

624
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,120
that if we are wasting some money somewhere,

625
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,080
we can utilize some money for Sahaja Yoga.

626
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,120
We should have some money for our organization.

627
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,880
Otherwise this is how, whatever we save on food or anything,

628
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,800
that's very little amount;

629
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,320
but still we are managing.

630
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,040
Every guru takes money outside first and then come to the puja

631
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,840
- outside, and that too, real, sumptuous one.

632
00:39:13,265 --> 00:39:14,612
I don't need any money.

633
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:18,680
Even your puja money, everything, you know it goes into silver,

634
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,360
because you cannot have puja with plastics.

635
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,640
So to understand this you have to have auspiciousness, holiness.

636
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,760
Now, you call Me "Holy Mother,"

637
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,920
but are you respectful like that?

638
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,000
Do you know what I am? Ganesha knew.

639
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,800
Once, His Father said that

640
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

641
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,520
I'll give that person a present."

642
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,720
So another brother, Kartikeya,

643
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,080
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

644
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,720
was a peacock,

645
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,200
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

646
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,160
and He could never have competed with Him.

647
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,440
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

648
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,200
She is the greatest of all.

649
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,280
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

650
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:20,668
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

651
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,480
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

652
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,840
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

653
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:35,400
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

654
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,080
I mean, though I must say I'm a Mahamaya, no doubt, it's not easy.

655
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,080
You will never know Me fully, never -- that should not be;

656
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,280
because then you won't sit here, you'll all run away.

657
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,640
But despite that, try to understand.

658
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,720
As Ganesha has understood His Mother, you have to understand.

659
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,440
That extent is rather difficult, but still try:

660
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,920
that this is the Power sitting before you.

661
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,720
How we behave, how we talk, how we take decisions,

662
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,240
what we do, is all wrong.

663
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,440
If this doesn't penetrate into your brains

664
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,560
that means kundalini has not come there.

665
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,400
People could not raise even one kundalini, one person's kundalini.

666
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,840
Even this artist who came, she said, "How can it be possible?

667
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,200
I'm not so - I've done nothing.

668
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,560
I'm not a person who is a saint. How can I get realization?"

669
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,720
She was telling Me like this, "How can it be, Mother?"

670
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,000
But you all got it, no doubt you have,

671
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,480
none of you have doubts about it.

672
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,400
And not only that it's happening through Me,

673
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,120
but you also can do it now.

674
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,840
Who can do this kind of a thing, in the history of spirituality?

675
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:59,720
But I keep a kind of a image of Myself,

676
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,560
I joke, I make fun,

677
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,280
I do everything just like a normal mother.

678
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,120
But that should not give you liberties -- that should not.

679
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,560
Some people have written very rude letters to Me.

680
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,840
I must tell you: be careful,

681
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,033
you can't write rude letters to Me.

682
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:22,279
Better not. When you suffer then you'll say,

683
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,399
"Mother, this has happened, that has happened."

684
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,239
You have no business to write rude letters to Me.

685
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,320
And though I read them and I forgive, no doubt,

686
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,160
because you are ignorant. But you must have knowledge,

687
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,760
you must understand this,

688
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,360
that Whom are you writing and what you are writing.

689
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,240
This side is, of course,

690
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,280
we have to see that Shri Ganesha has also a parasha in his hand.

691
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,040
He is one of the most strict deity, very strict.

692
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,320
Others may little bit hesitate,

693
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,600
but He cannot tolerate. That's why Christ has said that

694
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,480
"I will tolerate anything against Me,

695
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,320
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

696
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,760
Clearly He has warned - clearly,

697
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,000
because He has a parasha in His hand

698
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,600
and people get punished, no doubt.

699
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,760
So this is another thing one has to understand,

700
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,360
that Shri Ganesha has this parasha.

701
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,240
And you too all have this parasha in your hand,

702
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,600
which you don't know.

703
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,400
Anybody who will try to trouble you will be in trouble.

704
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,320
But what is missing is the faith.

705
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,880
not blind but enlightened faith.

706
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,840
If you have enlightened faith, then it works.

707
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,560
There's one gentleman working in London airport,

708
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,840
he's an Indian

709
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,120
but I think he was looked after by some Western foreigner people

710
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,840
- very good man.

711
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,440
So he cannot come to program, he is very busy and all that, he cannot.

712
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,040
But if I am in the airport he knows I am there.

713
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,480
Some people tried to trouble him.

714
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,120
So he said that "Don't trouble me.

715
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,360
My Mother is very strong, you know; don't trouble me."

716
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,400
They wouldn't listen, three of them.

717
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,240
And the three of them next day lost their jobs.

718
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:47,598
He said, "Why?" They said, "We don't know.

719
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,160
The boss told us, 'You get out of the jobs.'

720
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,160
We don't know how we lost our jobs."

721
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,440
And still today they haven't got jobs.

722
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,040
He said, "I had told you."

723
00:45:03,161 --> 00:45:05,918
They said, "Who is your Mother? Let us meet Her also.

724
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:09,199
You see, this is what has happened to us, sorry we did this to you..."

725
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,640
But nothing works out now.

726
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,080
So you must have full faith in Sahaja Yoga,

727
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,720
in Me, and in yourself.

728
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:24,013
Those who do not have faith in themselves,

729
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:26,920
how can they have faith in others?

730
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,200
This is another one thing you must understand,

731
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,040
that you have tremendous powers,

732
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,560
tremendous powers if you have faith.

733
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,040
You'll just pray,

734
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:44,311
"Mother, I want this gentleman to be cured,

735
00:45:44,432 --> 00:45:45,830
or this lady to be cured."

736
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,240
It will be cured, you don't have to even touch that person --

737
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,640
but your faith.

738
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,480
Like yesterday they brought one lady.

739
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,840
I was very busy, I was talking, doing this,

740
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,680
and these are only two,three days when I have to really

741
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,880
work very hard  with all the problems, and I couldn't see her.

742
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,840
I said, "Why don't you go and cure? You can cure."

743
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,520
Why should any Sahaja Yogi suffer from anything

744
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,040
when there are other Sahaja Yogis?

745
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,880
Why should I cure anymore?

746
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,800
You all just put your hands and see if you can cure or not.

747
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,360
Even your prayers are so powerful, you have no idea.

748
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,160
Just pray.

749
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,800
You have got the parasha in your hand, and nobody can harm you.

750
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,200
And you have got the hand that can bless others.

751
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,760
You have got that.

752
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,720
You start your generosity and see, the Lakshmi will flow.

753
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,000
But if you are not generous,

754
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,200
calculating each and every pai - finished.

755
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Why should you?

756
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,640
The Lakshmi will serve you.

757
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,160
Know your powers, as Shri Ganesha knew it very well.

758
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,160
He never bothered.

759
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,680
Even with an elephant head He managed so many things.

760
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,560
With human heads you should manage much better -

761
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,000
or do you need elephant heads?

762
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,000
Then another thing He has,

763
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,560
that He's a satisfied person, extremely satisfied.

764
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,880
And what He eats is a modoka, they have given Me just now here,

765
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,000
is the modoka He eats.

766
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,200
So that means that He eats something which is substantial,

767
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,720
which has got all these dry fruits

768
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,480
and everything in it, that's what He eats.

769
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And that is one capacity He has,

770
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,000
to eat;

771
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,720
because you can please Him by giving Him things.

772
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,920
But Mine is just the other way round:

773
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,640
I can't eat much, and you want to give Me.

774
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,680
I don't know, He has taken all My capacity to eat, I think.

775
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,920
But He can eat well.

776
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,400
And whatever you eat,

777
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,520
if you think of Him, "Shri Ganesha, I offer you this food also,"

778
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,400
you'll never find dearth of food at all, never.

779
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,200
Anything you want - like the other day it was very hot.

780
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,440
They said, "Mother, let's cool it down."

781
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,000
I said, "All right."

782
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,760
As soon as we cooled it down,

783
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,840
left to the right, Shri Ganesha comes in.

784
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,120
So He came with full force,

785
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,480
He cooled it down

786
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,480
and rained, and rained and rained, brought water also

787
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,880
because there was no water in these streams.

788
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:41,440
You had to do your footsoaking, so water came also.

789
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,800
And what a testing it - in one thing, how much happened.

790
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,200
He tested you, He saw you, nothing happened.

791
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,280
Even a little tent was not blown off.

792
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,000
It was all fun.

793
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,880
This is what is,

794
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,840
that you are also a testing ground for others.

795
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,440
Immediately you will know what sort of a man is.

796
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,920
You are so powerful.

797
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,280
Use your powers, use your powers.

798
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,040
But what happens if your attention is on other things,

799
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,280
it's not pure. Attention is on other

800
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,760
- keep attention on Shri Ganesh,

801
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,920
keep attention on Me.

802
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,800
Everything will work out. Why should you work when

803
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,640
He is there to work out everything for you,

804
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,480
His ganas are there to work out for you?

805
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,840
So put your attention in such a way

806
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:53,200
that you know you are alert, daksha, you are alert,

807
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,000
you know where is your attention going.

808
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,760
And then you see the attention how it works.

809
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:08,000
I never expected that I'll mature you so fast, but you have matured.

810
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:14,000
But unless and until you know yourself fully what you have got,

811
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,440
how am I to give you certificate?

812
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,553
Even if I give certificate you won't believe.

813
00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:22,549
Like they say you have graduated.

814
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:26,790
Now you are not only graduated, but you are masters.

815
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,120
Otherwise I would never have told you to ask for Gurupada.

816
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,520
You are praveenas now.

817
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
"Praveen" means a master.

818
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,920
Use your mastery.

819
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,000
But still you are sitting at home, this, that,

820
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,440
"My father is sick." Go and treat him

821
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,920
- you are a master.

822
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,480
Like Shri Ganesha, such a little thing like that

823
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,440
is the master, you are also masters.

824
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,680
The ladies also should know they are also masters.

825
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,560
Instead of getting involved into smaller things

826
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,840
and brickbats and all that, rise!

827
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,240
The another great quality of Him is that

828
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,920
He uses His teeth to write.

829
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,600
Teeth come to you from Shri Krishna --

830
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,760
wisdom of Shri Krishna which becomes the Virat, the brain.

831
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,360
So He uses the teeth to write.

832
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,080
He wrote Mahabharata with His teeth.

833
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,760
So it is said that you must use

834
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,680
your brain

835
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,120
with the enlightenment of Shri Krishna

836
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,640
and write, write, and write,

837
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,880
and produce it into books.

838
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,200
All these gurus have been successful because they created books.

839
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,200
And these books were read by people

840
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,480
and they were so much impressed,

841
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,560
because anything black and white becomes something great.

842
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,600
You can also make nice dramas as you have made.

843
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,520
You can approach the televisions

844
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,120
and things, that "We have a nice drama for children."

845
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,920
Now think about going in to people,

846
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,600
live in the society, live with them,

847
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:38,400
deliver to them what you have got it. It's your duty.

848
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,840
It's not only that but it is also,

849
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,800
it's a special privilege to you.

850
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,280
I mean, for today as it is we had to delay,

851
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,720
and I've tried to give you

852
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,240
some points about Shri Ganesh.

853
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,640
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

854
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,040
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

855
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,000
So I hope you will understand the essential,

856
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,800
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

857
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,880
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

858
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,680
May God bless you all.

859
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,800
Where is Sandeep?

860
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,160
The tower we had, where is it?

861
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,680
I had an ivory tower, where is it?.

862
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,600
A tower like... It's kept there, I think, in the room.

863
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
We should get it here.

864
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,760
So today only the children will come, and unmarried girls,

865
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:14,440
because today is - I mean, She was married, but She is the Virgin.

866
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,880
She's a Virgin, when She created Ganesha,

867
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:24,080
