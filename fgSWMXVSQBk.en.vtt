WEBVTT

00:12.550 --> 00:20.400
so this this Center that is what we call

00:17.770 --> 00:28.180
the swadhishthana Center is a center

00:20.400 --> 00:29.380
that gives you your future energy to

00:28.180 --> 00:32.560
think of your future

00:29.380 --> 00:35.410
your planning which gives you energy to

00:32.560 --> 00:38.560
bring forth the manifestation of the

00:35.410 --> 00:42.610
physical labor or physical exercise or

00:38.560 --> 00:45.160
physical work this poor Center has to

00:42.610 --> 00:52.510
work for one work to convert the fact

00:45.160 --> 00:54.519
for the use of the brain now if one

00:52.510 --> 00:56.379
Center which has to do many other things

00:54.519 --> 01:00.120
starts doing only one work all other

00:56.379 --> 01:03.579
things are neglected as a result of that

01:00.120 --> 01:07.120
you develop problems because it has to

01:03.579 --> 01:15.610
cater to your liver your pancreas to

01:07.120 --> 01:20.520
your kidneys to your spleen and once it

01:15.610 --> 01:24.250
goes into action for one channelized

01:20.520 --> 01:26.200
work it gets programmed for it and then

01:24.250 --> 01:29.590
it cannot take care of these things

01:26.200 --> 01:35.560
that's how you develop a bad liver you

01:29.590 --> 01:39.880
develop a diabetes kidney trouble

01:35.560 --> 01:44.530
blood pressures also you develop a very

01:39.880 --> 01:48.570
serious disease called blood cancer now

01:44.530 --> 01:53.350
sahaja yoga can cure all these troubles

01:48.570 --> 01:56.380
it's only physical but it can cure even

01:53.350 --> 01:59.770
physical troubles because if this Center

01:56.380 --> 02:03.390
is brought this normal behavior if it is

01:59.770 --> 02:08.769
made to behave in a very normal way you

02:03.390 --> 02:12.459
can easily cure all such diseases which

02:08.769 --> 02:16.150
come out of your over an activity over

02:12.459 --> 02:18.190
thinking over imaginative Ness it's a

02:16.150 --> 02:21.010
very dangerous thing to always think

02:18.190 --> 02:22.600
about the future for example now we are

02:21.010 --> 02:25.670
here sitting down we should be

02:22.600 --> 02:28.290
comfortably sitting down

02:25.670 --> 02:30.060
talking to each other instead of that

02:28.290 --> 02:33.090
yeah now we are thinking what am I going

02:30.060 --> 02:35.430
to go do tomorrow or what am I going to

02:33.090 --> 02:38.640
do when I go home how I'm going to cook

02:35.430 --> 02:43.910
what am I going to eat or how I'm going

02:38.640 --> 02:47.780
to take my train all these futuristic

02:43.910 --> 02:50.670
behaviors lead you to a very funny

02:47.780 --> 02:53.190
personality you become so futuristic

02:50.670 --> 02:56.640
that you forget the past I met a

02:53.190 --> 02:59.940
gentleman who forgot even his own name

02:56.640 --> 03:02.700
he forgot the name of his father he

02:59.940 --> 03:06.720
forgot the name of his mother and also

03:02.700 --> 03:09.299
to the dismay of his wife her name and

03:06.720 --> 03:12.569
she started crying she said now what to

03:09.299 --> 03:15.120
do he's forgotten everything now he is

03:12.569 --> 03:18.870
in a futuristic it in hell he just knows

03:15.120 --> 03:22.410
the future then he was to be pushed back

03:18.870 --> 03:25.080
again into the center then gradually he

03:22.410 --> 03:27.299
started remembering then he told me that

03:25.080 --> 03:32.310
he's chairman of one of the council's of

03:27.299 --> 03:34.260
a big district place in India and he

03:32.310 --> 03:37.260
said he was he said no I am I said

03:34.260 --> 03:40.079
that's good that's better now you are in

03:37.260 --> 03:42.090
that stage where you say I am so this is

03:40.079 --> 03:44.640
what happens and this is what's going to

03:42.090 --> 03:49.769
happen to our societies here which is

03:44.640 --> 03:51.750
very futuristic so to cut it down one

03:49.769 --> 03:53.670
can try anything you may try anything

03:51.750 --> 03:55.829
for example you may show pictures of the

03:53.670 --> 03:58.019
past and things like that but that is

03:55.829 --> 04:01.200
not going to bring back the horse it's

03:58.019 --> 04:03.480
running very fast the only thing that

04:01.200 --> 04:06.660
can work it out is the awakening of the

04:03.480 --> 04:07.950
Kundalini when the corn Kundalini

04:06.660 --> 04:13.019
awakens itself

04:07.950 --> 04:17.190
she makes the center enlightened and the

04:13.019 --> 04:21.239
center itself resumed its normal shape

04:17.190 --> 04:24.510
its normal behavior and its normal

04:21.239 --> 04:27.380
condition apart from that it has got a

04:24.510 --> 04:27.380
dynamic

04:29.509 --> 04:35.719
power or manifestation that this one

04:33.189 --> 04:40.550
this Center which looks after our

04:35.719 --> 04:43.159
attention becomes enlightened and our

04:40.550 --> 04:45.770
attention becomes enlightened and the

04:43.159 --> 04:49.069
attention which is enlightened becomes

04:45.770 --> 04:51.289
dynamic in the sense now sitting down

04:49.069 --> 04:53.210
here you can pay attention to anyone

04:51.289 --> 04:55.279
just pay attention you don't have to do

04:53.210 --> 04:57.169
anything just pay attention to that

04:55.279 --> 04:58.819
person and you can find out on your

04:57.169 --> 05:01.789
fingertips what's the matter with a

04:58.819 --> 05:04.819
person thousands of miles

05:01.789 --> 05:07.189
he may be priceless said your hands will

05:04.819 --> 05:11.060
speak that's the time has come these

05:07.189 --> 05:13.699
hands which we which look so silly but

05:11.060 --> 05:17.509
they are so intricate and so intricately

05:13.699 --> 05:22.879
built that the nerve endings are so

05:17.509 --> 05:27.469
microscope that we cannot understand how

05:22.879 --> 05:30.529
much they can tell us how far taken when

05:27.469 --> 05:33.499
the awakening takes place you start

05:30.529 --> 05:35.479
feeling the vibrations around the

05:33.499 --> 05:36.490
all-pervading power which you have never

05:35.479 --> 05:39.289
felt before

05:36.490 --> 05:41.990
through these fingertips these

05:39.289 --> 05:45.740
fingertips which we neglect we misuse

05:41.990 --> 05:48.199
them we use them for wrong things these

05:45.740 --> 05:51.050
fingertips themselves get enlightened

05:48.199 --> 05:55.089
and you start feeling them that's what I

05:51.050 --> 05:57.860
said that you have to get your awareness

05:55.089 --> 06:01.159
which is enlightened it's the awareness

05:57.860 --> 06:04.069
which has to manifest and that's how you

06:01.159 --> 06:06.469
start feeling them on your fingers it's

06:04.069 --> 06:09.469
wrong here what's wrong there you can

06:06.469 --> 06:13.310
see well it's the problem now all these

06:09.469 --> 06:16.430
are related to your centers these are 5

06:13.310 --> 06:18.919
6 & 7 7 on the left and 7 on the right

06:16.430 --> 06:21.229
so this is about your emotional side and

06:18.919 --> 06:25.370
this is about your life about your

06:21.229 --> 06:27.649
physical and your rational or you can

06:25.370 --> 06:31.759
say mental side so you can make out a

06:27.649 --> 06:33.889
person how he by just knowing whether

06:31.759 --> 06:35.959
you are getting heat from that person

06:33.889 --> 06:37.819
whether you are getting burning from

06:35.959 --> 06:40.219
that person whether they are getting

06:37.819 --> 06:42.360
numb whether they are begging becoming

06:40.219 --> 06:44.729
heavy

06:42.360 --> 06:47.159
a rapport is established with the

06:44.729 --> 06:49.669
all-pervading power which informs you

06:47.159 --> 06:49.669
get the message
