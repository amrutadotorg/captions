00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:20.400
so this this Center that is what we call

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:28.180
the swadhishthana Center is a center

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.380
that gives you your future energy to

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.560
think of your future

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.410
your planning which gives you energy to

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.560
bring forth the manifestation of the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.610
physical labor or physical exercise or

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.160
physical work this poor Center has to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:52.510
work for one work to convert the fact

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:54.519
for the use of the brain now if one

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.379
Center which has to do many other things

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.120
starts doing only one work all other

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.579
things are neglected as a result of that

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.120
you develop problems because it has to

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:15.610
cater to your liver your pancreas to

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:20.520
your kidneys to your spleen and once it

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:24.250
goes into action for one channelized

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.200
work it gets programmed for it and then

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.590
it cannot take care of these things

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:35.560
that's how you develop a bad liver you

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.880
develop a diabetes kidney trouble

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.530
blood pressures also you develop a very

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.570
serious disease called blood cancer now

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:53.350
sahaja yoga can cure all these troubles

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.380
it's only physical but it can cure even

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.770
physical troubles because if this Center

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.390
is brought this normal behavior if it is

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.769
made to behave in a very normal way you

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:12.459
can easily cure all such diseases which

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:16.150
come out of your over an activity over

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.190
thinking over imaginative Ness it's a

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.010
very dangerous thing to always think

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.600
about the future for example now we are

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.670
here sitting down we should be

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.290
comfortably sitting down

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.060
talking to each other instead of that

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.090
yeah now we are thinking what am I going

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.430
to go do tomorrow or what am I going to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.640
do when I go home how I'm going to cook

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.910
what am I going to eat or how I'm going

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.780
to take my train all these futuristic

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.670
behaviors lead you to a very funny

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.190
personality you become so futuristic

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.640
that you forget the past I met a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.940
gentleman who forgot even his own name

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.700
he forgot the name of his father he

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.720
forgot the name of his mother and also

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.299
to the dismay of his wife her name and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.569
she started crying she said now what to

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.120
do he's forgotten everything now he is

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.870
in a futuristic it in hell he just knows

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.410
the future then he was to be pushed back

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.080
again into the center then gradually he

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.299
started remembering then he told me that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.310
he's chairman of one of the council's of

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.260
a big district place in India and he

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.260
said he was he said no I am I said

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.079
that's good that's better now you are in

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.090
that stage where you say I am so this is

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.640
what happens and this is what's going to

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:49.769
happen to our societies here which is

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.750
very futuristic so to cut it down one

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.670
can try anything you may try anything

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.829
for example you may show pictures of the

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.019
past and things like that but that is

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.200
not going to bring back the horse it's

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.480
running very fast the only thing that

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.660
can work it out is the awakening of the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.950
Kundalini when the corn Kundalini

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.019
awakens itself

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:17.190
she makes the center enlightened and the

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:21.239
center itself resumed its normal shape

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.510
its normal behavior and its normal

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.380
condition apart from that it has got a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.380
dynamic

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.719
power or manifestation that this one

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:40.550
this Center which looks after our

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:43.159
attention becomes enlightened and our

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.770
attention becomes enlightened and the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:49.069
attention which is enlightened becomes

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.289
dynamic in the sense now sitting down

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.210
here you can pay attention to anyone

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.279
just pay attention you don't have to do

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.169
anything just pay attention to that

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.819
person and you can find out on your

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.789
fingertips what's the matter with a

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.819
person thousands of miles

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.189
he may be priceless said your hands will

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:11.060
speak that's the time has come these

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:13.699
hands which we which look so silly but

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.509
they are so intricate and so intricately

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:22.879
built that the nerve endings are so

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:27.469
microscope that we cannot understand how

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:30.529
much they can tell us how far taken when

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:33.499
the awakening takes place you start

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.479
feeling the vibrations around the

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.490
all-pervading power which you have never

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.289
felt before

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.990
through these fingertips these

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:45.740
fingertips which we neglect we misuse

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.199
them we use them for wrong things these

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.050
fingertips themselves get enlightened

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:55.089
and you start feeling them that's what I

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.860
said that you have to get your awareness

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:01.159
which is enlightened it's the awareness

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.069
which has to manifest and that's how you

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:06.469
start feeling them on your fingers it's

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.469
wrong here what's wrong there you can

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:13.310
see well it's the problem now all these

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:16.430
are related to your centers these are 5

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.919
6 & 7 7 on the left and 7 on the right

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.229

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.370
this is about your life about your

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:27.649
physical and your rational or you can

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.759
say mental side so you can make out a

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:33.889
person how he by just knowing whether

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.959
you are getting heat from that person

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.819
whether you are getting burning from

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.219
that person whether they are getting

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.360
numb whether they are begging becoming

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.729
heavy

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.159
a rapport is established with the

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.669
all-pervading power which informs you

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.669
