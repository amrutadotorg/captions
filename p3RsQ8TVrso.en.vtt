00:02.320 --> 00:18.510
Thank you for the invitation. This is an interview with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi on the 12th of May, 1987. Interview begins 5 seconds from now.

00:18.510 --> 00:24.490
Shri Mataji, we’ve been told that there were three thousand people at your program in Sydney

00:24.490 --> 00:29.640
and the hundreds rushed forward after the program to speak to You and to shake You by the hand.

00:29.640 --> 00:35.330
This is a very unusual thing in Australia. Why do you think this happened?

00:35.330 --> 00:41.440
I think there were not three thousand, maybe less, because the whole didn’t counting many people.

00:41.440 --> 00:45.260
But there were quite a lot, about two thousand.

00:45.260 --> 00:48.880
And they did rush to thank Me

00:48.880 --> 01:02.540
and their eyes were glancing with light and their faces were looking very enlightened and happy, joyous.

01:02.540 --> 01:07.870
Because this is the greatest thing that can happen to human beings.

01:07.870 --> 01:12.250
In many ages it happens: the rebirth of a person.

01:12.250 --> 01:15.680
And they felt the rebirth within themselves.

01:15.680 --> 01:21.340
The peace within themselves and the cool breath coming out of their own heads

01:21.340 --> 01:28.150
and all that convinced them and that’s why they just came to thank Me. Out of gratitude, I think.

01:28.150 --> 01:34.330
With your respect, Shri Mataji, the world is full of people promising the millennium.

01:34.330 --> 01:39.980
One by one they becoming exposed as charlatans, tricks us.

01:39.980 --> 01:43.480
How can we know when we have been deluded?

01:43.480 --> 01:53.250
I have been telling from 1981, in Australia, I visited four times before;

01:53.250 --> 01:58.890
every year openly telling people that: “Be aware of false people”.

01:58.890 --> 02:05.130
The first thing to know that you cannot be for your Self-Realisation;

02:05.130 --> 02:08.940
nor you can have any course of it.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.960
You cannot do anything about it, it is effortless.

02:12.960 --> 02:17.180
How can you pay for anything that is the living process?

02:17.180 --> 02:20.970
This is a simple thing which people didn’t like that time,

02:20.970 --> 02:24.460
because they were following some guru or some false guru.

02:24.460 --> 02:32.440
And some of those people who are now exposed came to even hit me with Bible and things like that.

02:32.440 --> 02:37.050
All because I was saying that you can’t take money.

02:37.050 --> 02:39.940
But that is not the only thing.

02:39.940 --> 02:49.260
The person who talks about God should be able to give you the inner knowledge about your roots.

02:49.260 --> 02:55.340
As soon as just give you a few words or some mantras, or things like that,

02:55.340 --> 03:07.900
he must tell you why he is doing it, what is the purpose of his telling you of some mantras or of some sort of a prayer.

03:07.900 --> 03:12.340
If somebody claims something, than he must prove it.

03:12.340 --> 03:18.850
Now the first thing that should take place in the modern times is the Realisation.

03:18.850 --> 03:24.430
That has been promised that at this time Self-Realisation will take place.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.430
And that’s what should happen.

03:26.430 --> 03:33.850
Unless and until that happens to you which is also indicated in other scriptures that your hands will speak.

03:33.850 --> 03:36.080
In Sahaja Yoga your hands start speaking.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.230
They start indicating what is the problem with you,

03:39.230 --> 03:41.230
what is the problem of others

03:41.230 --> 03:50.380
and also not only that, but you can get yourself cured, you can get other people cured.

03:50.380 --> 03:54.510
Beyond that you have your peace, your joy;

03:54.510 --> 03:59.540
and so many things after that you feel that you are transformed.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.170
Unless and until these things happen to you,

04:02.170 --> 04:05.880
why should you believe people who claim that I am this and I am that?

04:05.880 --> 04:09.150
See, I just don’t understand.

04:09.150 --> 04:11.860
What you are saying sounds almost evolutionary.

04:11.860 --> 04:17.230
It sounds almost that we are on the threshold of some new stage…

04:17.230 --> 04:20.510
Yes, of course, that’s the reason is, today that’s the reason

04:20.510 --> 04:25.560
that a great evolution, a mass evolution has to take place.

04:25.560 --> 04:33.080
You have to break through into a new dimension of your awareness

04:33.080 --> 04:40.120
which have be called as thoughtless awareness as Jung has described very clearly.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.120
But beyond that is collective consciousness

04:43.120 --> 04:49.130
that is you become conscious of others and yourself

04:49.130 --> 04:55.400
in the whole like a microcosm becoming conscious of macrocosm.

04:55.400 --> 05:01.480
All these things these people don’t even talk; leave alone doing anything about it.

05:01.480 --> 05:06.390
But still people run to them, because they think they can purchase them,

05:06.390 --> 05:12.300
they can pay for it and this ego keeps them satisfied.

05:12.300 --> 05:18.560
So, the human being is not as complete as we like to think so. Our most ages yet come.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.670
Of course, it is not complete.

05:20.670 --> 05:25.470
It has to reach the state which is absolute, where the truth is one:

05:25.470 --> 05:30.120
where your nervous system should tell whether it is true or not.

05:30.120 --> 05:36.670
When you get your Self-Realization from your hands you start feeling a cool breeze flowing,

05:36.670 --> 05:46.360
you feel it all around you. Supposing, something is wrong, something is evil,

05:46.360 --> 05:54.110
than immediately you know on your hands that it is hot, it is burning, it’s evil;

05:54.110 --> 05:56.890
or something is wrong on different centres,

05:56.890 --> 06:02.130
than a different, the same finger which denotes that particular area

06:02.130 --> 06:06.890
will start burning or indicating that there is something wrong with that person.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.650
This sounds rather like a description of something that happens on these day and age

06:14.650 --> 06:23.210
where people talk something having “good vibes” or “bad vibes”. Is this a kind of vibratory awareness?

06:26.050 --> 06:34.630
When I went to America first time, in 1973, I talk to them about vibrations

06:34.630 --> 06:37.700
and told them there are good and bad.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.360
And there was a gentleman who organized My program

06:40.360 --> 06:44.220
and he said you must get everything,

06:44.220 --> 06:57.820
what you say to that…absolutely certified, what do you say to that, in your...

06:57.820 --> 06:59.830
I am not quite sure…

06:59.830 --> 07:03.800
This is like you get a certificate from the government that this is what you have said…

07:03.800 --> 07:06.910
Oh, yes, certified, - it has to be correct.

07:06.910 --> 07:11.920
Certified. So, this is your own words and your own things.

07:11.920 --> 07:16.610
I laughed at him. I said, “You see, that’s not to be certified. What is the need?

07:16.610 --> 07:20.930
Let people use these words ultimately they come to the right thing,

07:20.930 --> 07:27.550
because just by talking about it, it’s not going to convince anyone».

07:27.550 --> 07:32.740
So, it has to be felt, it has to happen, the experience has to be there.

07:32.740 --> 07:36.970
They have to actually feel the bad and the good, clearly,

07:36.970 --> 07:39.520
and that is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

07:39.520 --> 07:45.850
I do not want to appropriate everything to Myself, but I know nobody else can do it.

07:45.850 --> 07:48.780
If they can do it, it is very good for Me.

07:48.780 --> 07:56.190
So, when a person practices Sahaja Yoga, they actually feel these things?

07:56.190 --> 07:58.190
They actually feel everything.

07:58.190 --> 08:03.450
They actually feel on central nervous system which is the sign that he has evolved,

08:03.450 --> 08:08.090
because whenever there is an evolution you feel it on your central nervous system.

08:08.090 --> 08:13.460
So, are you telling me that a day will come and we can actually tell

08:13.460 --> 08:17.630
whether a person is lying or being insincere?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.970
Of course, of course, that is nothing.

08:19.970 --> 08:26.840
You can even tell if a person has got cancer or he has got liver trouble, or he has got heart trouble.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.930
Also you can tell if he is mentally alright or not.

08:29.930 --> 08:33.270
Also you can tell if he has been to a wrong guru

08:33.270 --> 08:38.440
or he had some spiritual problems from a wrong guru, than immediately tell.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.970
And all this comes from the Self-Realization?

08:40.970 --> 08:45.390
Yes, of course, I mean that you become aware of things

08:45.390 --> 08:50.440
which you were not aware of before get your Self-Realization.
