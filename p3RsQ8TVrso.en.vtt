00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:18.510
Thank you for the invitation. This is an interview with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi on the 12th of May, 1987. Interview begins 5 seconds from now.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.490
Shri Mataji, we’ve been told that there were three thousand people at your program in Sydney

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.640
and the hundreds rushed forward after the program to speak to You and to shake You by the hand.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.330
This is a very unusual thing in Australia. Why do you think this happened?

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.440
I think there were not three thousand, maybe less, because the whole didn’t counting many people.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.260
But there were quite a lot, about two thousand.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.880
And they did rush to thank Me

00:00:48.880 --> 00:01:02.540
and their eyes were glancing with light and their faces were looking very enlightened and happy, joyous.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.870
Because this is the greatest thing that can happen to human beings.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.250
In many ages it happens: the rebirth of a person.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.680
And they felt the rebirth within themselves.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.340
The peace within themselves and the cool breath coming out of their own heads

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.150
and all that convinced them and that’s why they just came to thank Me. Out of gratitude, I think.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.330
With your respect, Shri Mataji, the world is full of people promising the millennium.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.980
One by one they becoming exposed as charlatans, tricks us.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.480
How can we know when we have been deluded?

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:53.250
I have been telling from 1981, in Australia, I visited four times before;

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.890
every year openly telling people that: “Be aware of false people”.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.130
The first thing to know that you cannot be for your Self-Realisation;

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.940
nor you can have any course of it.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.960
You cannot do anything about it, it is effortless.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.180
How can you pay for anything that is the living process?

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.970
This is a simple thing which people didn’t like that time,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.460
because they were following some guru or some false guru.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:32.440
And some of those people who are now exposed came to even hit me with Bible and things like that.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.050
All because I was saying that you can’t take money.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.940
But that is not the only thing.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.260
The person who talks about God should be able to give you the inner knowledge about your roots.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.340
As soon as just give you a few words or some mantras, or things like that,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:07.900
he must tell you why he is doing it, what is the purpose of his telling you of some mantras or of some sort of a prayer.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.340
If somebody claims something, than he must prove it.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.850
Now the first thing that should take place in the modern times is the Realisation.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.430
That has been promised that at this time Self-Realisation will take place.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.430
And that’s what should happen.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.850
Unless and until that happens to you which is also indicated in other scriptures that your hands will speak.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.080
In Sahaja Yoga your hands start speaking.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.230
They start indicating what is the problem with you,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.230
what is the problem of others

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:50.380
and also not only that, but you can get yourself cured, you can get other people cured.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.510
Beyond that you have your peace, your joy;

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.540
and so many things after that you feel that you are transformed.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.170
Unless and until these things happen to you,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.880
why should you believe people who claim that I am this and I am that?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.150
See, I just don’t understand.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.860
What you are saying sounds almost evolutionary.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.230
It sounds almost that we are on the threshold of some new stage…

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.510
Yes, of course, that’s the reason is, today that’s the reason

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.560
that a great evolution, a mass evolution has to take place.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.080
You have to break through into a new dimension of your awareness

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.120
which have be called as thoughtless awareness as Jung has described very clearly.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
But beyond that is collective consciousness

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.130
that is you become conscious of others and yourself

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.400
in the whole like a microcosm becoming conscious of macrocosm.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.480
All these things these people don’t even talk; leave alone doing anything about it.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.390
But still people run to them, because they think they can purchase them,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.300
they can pay for it and this ego keeps them satisfied.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.560
So, the human being is not as complete as we like to think so. Our most ages yet come.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.670
Of course, it is not complete.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.470
It has to reach the state which is absolute, where the truth is one:

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.120
where your nervous system should tell whether it is true or not.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.670
When you get your Self-Realization from your hands you start feeling a cool breeze flowing,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:46.360
you feel it all around you. Supposing, something is wrong, something is evil,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:54.110
than immediately you know on your hands that it is hot, it is burning, it’s evil;

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.890
or something is wrong on different centres,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.130
than a different, the same finger which denotes that particular area

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.890
will start burning or indicating that there is something wrong with that person.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.650
This sounds rather like a description of something that happens on these day and age

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:23.210
where people talk something having “good vibes” or “bad vibes”. Is this a kind of vibratory awareness?

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:34.630
When I went to America first time, in 1973, I talk to them about vibrations

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.700
and told them there are good and bad.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.360
And there was a gentleman who organized My program

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.220
and he said you must get everything,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:57.820
what you say to that…absolutely certified, what do you say to that, in your...

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.830
I am not quite sure…

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.800
This is like you get a certificate from the government that this is what you have said…

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.910
Oh, yes, certified, - it has to be correct.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.920
Certified. So, this is your own words and your own things.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.610
I laughed at him. I said, “You see, that’s not to be certified. What is the need?

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.930
Let people use these words ultimately they come to the right thing,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.550
because just by talking about it, it’s not going to convince anyone».

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:32.740
So, it has to be felt, it has to happen, the experience has to be there.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.970
They have to actually feel the bad and the good, clearly,

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.520
and that is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.850
I do not want to appropriate everything to Myself, but I know nobody else can do it.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.780
If they can do it, it is very good for Me.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:56.190
So, when a person practices Sahaja Yoga, they actually feel these things?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.190
They actually feel everything.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.450
They actually feel on central nervous system which is the sign that he has evolved,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.090
because whenever there is an evolution you feel it on your central nervous system.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.460
So, are you telling me that a day will come and we can actually tell

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.630
whether a person is lying or being insincere?

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.970
Of course, of course, that is nothing.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:26.840
You can even tell if a person has got cancer or he has got liver trouble, or he has got heart trouble.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.930
Also you can tell if he is mentally alright or not.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.270
Also you can tell if he has been to a wrong guru

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.440
or he had some spiritual problems from a wrong guru, than immediately tell.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.970
And all this comes from the Self-Realization?

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.390
Yes, of course, I mean that you become aware of things

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.440
which you were not aware of before get your Self-Realization.
