1983-11-05 Talk To Sahaja Yogis, Eve Of Diwali Puja

00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:32.704
I've had a very hectic, strenuous journey through America

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:42.349
and it was much beyond my expectation, it worked
out very well and I'm very happy about it.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.954
All the Americans are very thankful to the Sahaja Yogis of England

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:55.327
and other countries who have contributed to this tour

00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:59.900
and specially to people who travelled across and went around

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:05.080
and helped them to organize.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.764
So they have been extremely grateful I tell you,

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:14.666
but for you people it would not have been possible.

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:20.396
It was a very strenuous journey, no doubt, and strenuous tour

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:27.837
and everything was a bit too much after the tour of Europe.

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:35.352
But the way people went from here and
you helped them, and you sent money.

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:38.474
There was much less strain on them and they could manage it very well

00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:44.084
and as you know that we
have done very well as far as

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:51.519
our sowing the seed of Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.784
So the seed of Sahaja Yoga, I think, is now sown

00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:59.928
and it may take a big flight,

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:02.545
I am sure because Americans have I know

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:06.144
they are very, people who are uprooted type

00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:12.164
and quite shallow people, and one can say that also

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:17.112
that they go on changing their gurus every third day

00:02:17.313 --> 00:02:23.869
and their cars every fourth day and their wives fifth day.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.064
But they have changed so many of them that it is easier to bring them round

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:36.365
and talk to them about reality,
that is the greatest part of it

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:41.819
and the most of them have been to some guru or someone.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.445
I think better give Me doesn't sound...

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:52.772
And the result of all that is that they have reached conclusions

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:59.968
that if reality has to come it should
come in the way Sahaja Yoga is.

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:04.319
So it's not such a difficult thing to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.317
But the best part of it, they have been to all gurus

00:03:07.518 --> 00:03:11.406
who have given them a good licking, real good licking.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:14.683
They have lost all their money, they have been trained so much,

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:17.445
they had to do all kinds of things and

00:03:17.646 --> 00:03:20.684
they had to starve themselves and no food

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:26.735
and sometimes they had to run for miles together,

00:03:26.936 --> 00:03:31.655
do all kinds of acrobatics and
all kinds of things they have done.

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:35.934
As a result, to them, Sahaja Yoga is very precious.

00:03:36.135 --> 00:03:40.333
This is a difference I think with others and Americans is,

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:43.799
because you have not known those severe type of gurus

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.012
that they have had who just torture their lives all the time

00:03:47.213 --> 00:03:50.420
saying that, "you have to do these things,

00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.279
just to get rid of your sins and this has to be done,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.248
because of your sins, you are like this".

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.123
And the main thing was, I discovered there

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:05.035
that the philosophers or the writers who wrote about the unconscious

00:04:05.236 --> 00:04:08.785
have also made a very big mistake. And they said that

00:04:08.986 --> 00:04:13.459
if you have to go to the unconscious,
you have to pass through subconscious.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.787
And when I saw this diagram I was surprised.

00:04:17.988 --> 00:04:21.029
Jung had done the diagram with the unconscious

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.321
and the unconscious becoming conscious and on top of that,

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:30.934
was the subconscious and then the conscious mind

00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:34.647
and then the ego. So it was such a mixed bag.

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:37.694
So I told them that god is the greatest planner

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:42.728
and He has kept the central path for you absolutely open

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:45.963
which is Sushumna path and the subconscious is on left

00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:48.512
and the supraconscious is on the right side.

00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:50.986
So you don't have to pass through all these things.

00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:55.281
Even in an airport supposing you have to pass through the luggage

00:04:55.482 --> 00:04:58.034
to go to the aeroplane what will happen?

00:04:58.235 --> 00:05:02.179
And when human beings can understand that? What about God?

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.820
He has to be a greater organiser, a greater thinker than we are.

00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:11.894
And he could not have thought of such a mixed bag for us that

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:15.820
when we have to ascend we have to go through our subconcious

00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.937
and then go to the unconscious. So the whole thing is

00:05:19.138 --> 00:05:23.629
they had no picture, it was all a mental projection.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.014
And that's  how they made all the mistakes there

00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:29.365
and when they published these things, perhaps the gurus

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:33.132
who are agurus must have taken a clue

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:37.116
and that's how they started talking that you have to go to unconscious.

00:05:37.317 --> 00:05:41.732
and that's how the whole thing has been worked out that people thought

00:05:41.933 --> 00:05:45.860
that we have to go to the
unconscious through the subconscious.

00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.011
And when this happened they said that if you have to go to

00:05:50.212 --> 00:05:52.405
the subconscious we must bear up everything,

00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:57.675
we must get possessed, we must get bhootish, we must take drugs,

00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:01.227
we must do all those things that the mad people are doing.

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:04.315
In addition to that they used Bible for that purpose,

00:06:04.515 --> 00:06:06.937
because in the Bible it is said that when the Holy Ghost came

00:06:07.138 --> 00:06:09.274
they all started behaving like mad people.

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:14.638
This was Mr Paul's mischief and that's how they justified it

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:19.140
that we all have to get mad to become spiritual.

00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:24.250
So this kind of a stupid idea was taken over and was exploited

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:31.302
by the real thugs of India. Then it is now taken over

00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:36.287
by the thugs of Amercians also. So the Americans are also

00:06:36.488 --> 00:06:39.462
forming some groups there, they have also become gurus

00:06:39.663 --> 00:06:45.227
and they are also teaching people that you have to become

00:06:45.428 --> 00:06:48.824
mad before becoming realized soul.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:52.055
It's such a thing that they never understood that

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:57.298
there has to be some sort of a way made by God Himself for our ascent.

00:06:57.498 --> 00:06:59.584
Why will He make it so difficult?

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:03.279
He has never made even a sprouting of the seed difficult,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.991
why will He make our evolution so difficult?

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:09.655
And that's why these poor things, you see, half of them are mad.

00:07:09.856 --> 00:07:12.280
Really mad people, when they came to Sahaja Yoga, they had blisters

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:16.186
all over their hands. All blisters on the left hand side, you could see

00:07:16.387 --> 00:07:19.583
all their hands were burning. Shaking all the time before Me,

00:07:19.784 --> 00:07:25.209
it was terrible I mean, I had to go on combating their bhoots

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:28.448
and I really go tired with it, absolutely tired.

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:33.344
Every place I went, there were people who had lots of these possessions in them.

00:07:33.545 --> 00:07:36.405
But the beauty about them which one should learn from them

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:40.550
is that once they realized that this is the way, it is the truth,

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:43.335
they are working very hard, extremely hard

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:47.812
and they are very disciplined people, they get up in the morning,

00:07:48.013 --> 00:07:51.021
have their baths, sit down for meditation, they work it out.

00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:55.739
They are not like us, you see, we are very happy, you see,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.295
floating in the air, "Mother is looking after us, it's all right,

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:03.032
we can get up at nine o'clock and then it's alright,

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:08.683
we say namaskar to Mother, write a nice poetry about her", finished.

00:08:08.884 --> 00:08:11.058
They are not like that. They are working it out

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:14.915
because what they said was very remarkable thing, what they said that,

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:17.868
"Mother, we have gone to hell actually.

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:22.459
And we have to really jet out, very fast, if you have to get out of it

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.754
otherwise we will never be there", which is a fact.

00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:28.595
And this is what one has to understand that

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:37.456
if you have to have any rapport with your spirit,

00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:41.338
you have to really work very hard. Now our -

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.421
so far our Sahaja Yoga in the west, so far, I would say,

00:08:44.622 --> 00:08:46.986
not further because today is new year's day,

00:08:47.187 --> 00:08:49.695
we have to take certain vows on a new year's day, isn't it?

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:54.680
So, so far has been a easy chair, as you call it, politician.

00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:57.575
And another thing that I discovered very funny there,

00:08:57.775 --> 00:09:00.805
which now I understand why people are like this in this country,

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.699
also everywhere which, you see, you understand it better

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.284
when you are little away from that place.

00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:08.778
So another thing I discovered was that

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:11.606
this cult called Christian ethics, you can say,

00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:14.450
I hope you have not talked about, have you? All right.

00:09:14.651 --> 00:09:17.690
Now the Christian ethics they told me was really

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.454
explained many things why you behave like this.

00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:24.183
Like one lady told me a story that there was a fellow who had

00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:30.812
a store of his own and he used very good locks, you see, to secure it.

00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:35.476
So the people protested saying that why did you lock your things so well,

00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:39.186
you should have given a chance for a burglar,

00:09:39.387 --> 00:09:44.378
you see, after all you could insure yourself but
why did you take away the chance of a burglar?

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:47.978
That kind of a Christian ethics works in our minds, you see.

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:51.809
So what we do, we always sympathize with a bhoot all the time.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.317
You see."Oh She is,Mother, so badly off, she is like this".

00:09:56.518 --> 00:10:01.920
"Arey baba! She is a bhoot". Didn't Modi tell you the saying of Ramadasa?

00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:06.514
Sanggetla tumhi?(did you tell them?)

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:14.983
So Modi said this, there which is Ramdas Swamy has said it,

00:10:15.184 --> 00:10:19.911
pishacha means a bhoot of a style, you see which sticks onto people,

00:10:20.112 --> 00:10:24.544
is pishacha. So he said,"Pishacha mage pishacha gele",

00:10:24.745 --> 00:10:28.693
after one bhoot, another bhoot has gone.

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:31.281
So who can go after that?

00:10:31.482 --> 00:10:34.953
Who can save that? I mean if they are going after the bhoot,

00:10:35.154 --> 00:10:38.944
and what sarthak means- what will they achieve out of it?

00:10:39.145 --> 00:10:43.413
The whole thing is that our mind "oh he is very much, Mother,

00:10:43.614 --> 00:10:46.998
we must help that person, we must do this for that person."

00:10:47.199 --> 00:10:49.730
All this Christian ethics is nonsensical.

00:10:49.965 --> 00:10:53.082
But Christ never said, he took a big hunter and beat all the people

00:10:53.283 --> 00:10:57.861
who had bhoots and took them out and put them in the sea.

00:10:58.062 --> 00:11:01.185
So this is some sort of Christian is different from Christ,

00:11:01.386 --> 00:11:09.169
so the Christian ethics is that always sympathize
with a person who is a bhootish person.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.565
Always, A bhootish person also has a method of creating sympathies.

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:19.877
So today on New Year's day, I think I should warn you certain things

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:23.120
that I have realized after going to
America.

00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:28.659
My human realization is improving.

00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:44.561
I had seen once, you see, there was lady who was running a restaurant.

00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:50.129
And one thief, you see, had stolen a coat from one restaurant and came to her restaurant

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.170
and would not pay the money and she
informed the police. So the police said

00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:56.555
"Has he got a very good coat?" "Yes", she said, "he has".

00:11:56.756 --> 00:12:01.890
"He's stolen from the other restaurant, we've
got the reports". So the police came in.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.113
So they filed a suit against this man that "he is a thief,

00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:10.399
he has stolen a coat from there and ate food here, never paid anything".

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.219
So these people, both the restaurant people had to go to the court

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.762
and give evidence saying that, you see, this fellow has stolen the coat

00:12:19.963 --> 00:12:23.707
and he didn't pay for anything and he was quarelling.

00:12:23.908 --> 00:12:26.298
And they have to spend two days and waste their money

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:29.347
because they earning out of their own restaurants.

00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:34.525
So the judge said, "Doesn't matter, he was drunk at that time,

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:38.655
so he should be forgiven because he was drunk", firstly.

00:12:38.856 --> 00:12:41.348
And secondly he was given money because he said,

00:12:41.549 --> 00:12:44.270
"I have no money now with me to travel around",

00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:46.867
while these people lost their money for two days.

00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:52.369
And the police sat down with the hand like this.
So this kind of ethics that we have, you see,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.349
is to sympathize always with bhoots, you see, wrong doers.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.396
Even if you read the newspaper, you are shocked.

00:12:59.597 --> 00:13:04.055
How are they released on one point that they were in imbalance?

00:13:04.256 --> 00:13:08.547
Because they were in imbalance, so they were released.

00:13:08.748 --> 00:13:11.396
They are sent on a parole, that man goes and kills

00:13:11.597 --> 00:13:14.500
ten people again, but because he was imbalanced.

00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:17.739
So it is more necessary that you keep him, if he is imbalance,.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:25.840
it is more necessary. To be imbalanced
is itself a sin, itself is criminal.

00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:28.997
If somebody is imbalanced, that means he is a criminal personality

00:13:29.198 --> 00:13:33.178
and such a criminal personality must be kept in lock and key.

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:36.254
Like in France I saw, I was going by a bus,

00:13:36.455 --> 00:13:40.217
now I understand many things, I didn't understand them before, I must say.

00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:44.955
So in France we were going by bus and one person boxing

00:13:45.156 --> 00:13:47.825
he was talking all kind of things. I said,"Oh God,

00:13:48.025 --> 00:13:51.500
This one is only spilling bhoots from his mouth, who is he?"

00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:55.493
They said he is a man who is talking about the war.

00:13:55.694 --> 00:13:58.758
I was so shocked, I said this man is talking about the war

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:01.405
and these things, why is he allowed to come on a bus?

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:03.840
Then the second one came in, then a lady came in,

00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:07.748
they were all talking, talking away something irrelevantly.

00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:11.252
They said these are all people who have suffered very much

00:14:11.453 --> 00:14:18.945
and they are coming into the bus and that's why they are like this.

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:21.284
So I said,"But why allow this people to come in?

00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:24.375
In India nobody will allow such a person to come inside."

00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:27.719
So I think Marie was there, she said "You see our government is

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.285
very sympathetic,you see, towards such people."

00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:34.409
I said, "But what about the rest of them? They are not sympathetic about the other people,

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.337
atleast they should be sometimes for a
change sympathetic with sane people."

00:14:38.538 --> 00:14:42.355
To have always sympathies with the insanity also shows that

00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:45.202
you are encouraging all the bhootish people to develop,

00:14:45.403 --> 00:14:50.309
to do what they like. I mean this is no sympathy at all.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.033
That is how this works out and I have seen

00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:57.074
this bhootish sympathy has also given Me lot of trouble.

00:14:57.275 --> 00:15:01.843
So you have to be little sympathetic towards your poor Mother.

00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:05.278
Now all sympathies of your bhoots must be given up.

00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:07.724
Because that has given Me lot of trouble throughout

00:15:07.924 --> 00:15:13.611
and now I understand why you people
always sympathize with bhoot people.

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:18.422
Now, as it is, in England, it is a sin to awaken somebody in the morning.

00:15:18.623 --> 00:15:24.600
I mean we have had big quarrels, fights, bouts, breaking of noses,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.655
everything because somebody woke up somebody in the morning time.

00:15:29.856 --> 00:15:34.280
And people sympathize and came and told, “Mother, after all you see

00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:37.800
this gentleman went and woke them up or the child started crying

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.740
in the morning and that person got up in the morning”.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.018
So it is a sinful thing in the West that if you wake up someone.

00:15:45.219 --> 00:15:48.440
But, you see, you have to change yourself now, if you have to be yogis,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.361
you must know that you cannot get easy chair yogi position.

00:15:55.562 --> 00:16:00.532
Normally you have to go to Himalayas, live in that cold,

00:16:00.733 --> 00:16:05.368
eat nothing for days together, wash off all your desires,

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:08.150
give up your wife, your children, everyone.

00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:11.420
But Sahaja Yoga, so far has been, you can have your wife,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.459
even if she is slightly bhootish, is all right.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.459
But if she is very much bhootish, still I have to worry about

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.052
the bhootish woman. Even if she destroys Sahaja Yoga, doesn’t matter,

00:16:22.253 --> 00:16:27.274
the sympathies are there. Even if she
does anything, that’s a wife, after all.

00:16:27.475 --> 00:16:30.611
Or a husband who is a bhootish, I get every time a letter,

00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:35.171
"my husband is a bhootish man, he beats me, he does this."

00:16:35.372 --> 00:16:41.283
Now, what am I to tell? You divorce your husband, what should I say?

00:16:41.484 --> 00:16:44.218
I mean, if he is bhootish, how can you be with a bhoot?

00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:46.880
You are a realized soul and gradually what happens

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.546
that you develop such a immunity with the bhoot

00:16:49.747 --> 00:16:53.486
that you don’t know you have become yourself a big bhoot

00:16:53.694 --> 00:16:56.826
And you go on with that and this. Can you imagine?

00:16:57.026 --> 00:17:01.986
We are creating here a race of yogis, of pure people.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:06.744
Now, why people were going to Himalayas?
Because there were no bhoots there.

00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:10.800
You see, very few people went there, stayed away from the madding crowd.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.583
You are staying in this horrible, hellish atmosphere,

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:19.130
where there are bhoots and bhoots and bhoots, all kinds.

00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:22.979
Now here it is more necessary that you should be very careful,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:29.323
supposing, you see, plague breaks out, any country.

00:17:29.524 --> 00:17:33.188
Then how people become cautious, they are so frightened that

00:17:33.389 --> 00:17:36.350
"we should not catch anything from the plague", isn’t it?

00:17:36.551 --> 00:17:39.816
In the same way we must know, now you are conscious of it.

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:43.880
But on the contrary this bhootish attachments are so great

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.247
that I do not know how to fight it.

00:17:47.448 --> 00:17:50.431
And the best part of it, you see, if you tell anybody, "why did you do it?"

00:17:50.632 --> 00:17:55.842
They say "it is the bhoot who did". But from
where is he residing? In your own house.

00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:59.440
Supposing in this house somebody is residing and he explodes the whole house,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.379
will you say that "the man who was residing has done it"?

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.757
You have to blame yourself. Why do you allow a bhoot to be abide in you?

00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.004
So today is a day,

00:18:10.205 --> 00:18:14.619
I mean yesterday’s day was a special day of Lakshmi puja.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.065
And you will be surprised in our house we put all the lights on.

00:18:19.288 --> 00:18:22.439
And the candles were lit up. As soon as the candles were lit up

00:18:22.639 --> 00:18:26.099
all My this, My foot, went into a contortion absolutely.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.243
It could not be brought to normal state. For at least half an hour,

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:32.500
we were struggling with it. The reason is all the bhoots of London

00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:38.757
perhaps touched My feet. And they got into there, that “save us”. So this is the situation is.

00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:42.524
While you are not at all aware of it.

00:18:42.725 --> 00:18:50.746
Now people think that you can compromise with righteousness,

00:18:50.947 --> 00:18:56.355
with God. You cannot. You cannot compromise.

00:18:56.556 --> 00:19:01.875
Whatever is pure has to be accepted in its purity, in its glory,

00:19:02.076 --> 00:19:05.726
and one has to work hard for it. You cannot just, you'll have your jobs,

00:19:05.927 --> 00:19:09.093
you’ll have your wives, you’ll eat your food, the special type of things,

00:19:09.294 --> 00:19:11.323
you must have your comforts, you must have everything.

00:19:11.524 --> 00:19:16.768
Is a first class journey to God.

00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:28.876
And the bhoots along with it going
towards God. Everybody is in the baggage.

00:19:29.077 --> 00:19:32.286
This is what one has to understand, we are yogis

00:19:32.486 --> 00:19:38.320
and we are people blessed specially to elevate the whole world.

00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:41.536
We are responsible for the whole Western
world.

00:19:41.737 --> 00:19:43.837
And what are we doing about it?

00:19:44.038 --> 00:19:47.394
And I asked these people who have been to gurus, I was amazed.

00:19:47.595 --> 00:19:51.082
Of course, money part was there, one thousand rupees each.

00:19:51.283 --> 00:19:56.399
And they said that "we are given food which nobody can eat". You get sick.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.024
One lady told me that she ate such a food that she developed a horrible disease

00:20:01.225 --> 00:20:05.178
and "doctors told me that I first of all give up this food."

00:20:05.379 --> 00:20:09.945
And you are forced to eat that food. And you have to wear very,

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:17.049
I mean, flimsy clothes and stand on the streets, sing songs,

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.905
walk in a procession, dance like a mad person,

00:20:21.112 --> 00:20:25.752
do all kind of things they do.

00:20:26.823 --> 00:20:31.022
Here in Sahaja Yoga they said nothing, is a drawing room treatment.

00:20:31.223 --> 00:20:34.162
But in the drawing room if you carry your bhoots also with you

00:20:34.363 --> 00:20:37.093
that’s not allowed.

00:20:37.294 --> 00:20:40.443
That’s not allowed. So one has to understand

00:20:40.643 --> 00:20:44.216
that though we have got our realization

00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:51.092
we have a very big responsibility and we
have to move with that responsibility.

00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:55.437
The greatest problem now of UK, also of France, I have seen,

00:20:55.637 --> 00:20:59.988
because of drinking habits or whatever it is, is lethargy.

00:21:00.189 --> 00:21:02.220
Excuses, brain is very…

00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:05.011
I tell you our Sahaja yogis also have tremendous brains.

00:21:05.212 --> 00:21:08.740
I mean sometimes I don’t know how to work on their excuses.

00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:12.000
“We had a public meeting which finished at eleven o’clock,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.440
so we couldn’t get up till eleven o’clock next day”.

00:21:14.647 --> 00:21:17.924
Twelve hours sleep you must have. Very hard working people.

00:21:18.124 --> 00:21:24.642
But your Mother sleeps the same time and I am a marathon race runner,

00:21:24.843 --> 00:21:28.670
every night whenever. I mean you have only one program,

00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:32.299
but then I go to Italy, I go to any place,

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:35.766
I have regularly, the whole year I am doing this.

00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:39.908
Still I get up early in the morning then why can’t you get up?

00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:43.778
All excuses are there: this is an excuse another is an excuse

00:21:43.979 --> 00:21:48.146
and then I have told so many people that "just get up at about four o’clock in the morning."

00:21:48.347 --> 00:21:50.736
Just get up, try and see and do it, it’s very good.

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:53.376
four o’clock I’ve been saying for the last ten years now.

00:21:53.577 --> 00:21:57.502
I don’t how many of you have tried that.

00:21:57.703 --> 00:22:02.801
Have your bath, get ready, have your bath

00:22:03.002 --> 00:22:05.532
and then sit down for meditation.

00:22:05.733 --> 00:22:10.213
The whole day will pass out very well and sleep at about 8 o’clock.

00:22:10.414 --> 00:22:13.667
It is English saying that ‘early to bed and early to rise’.

00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:18.337
But I have never seen any Englishman like that so far. It is the other way round.

00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:25.550
They’ll keep awake till one o’clock and get
up at about eleven o’clock or ten o’clock;

00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:29.003
will not even brush their teeth and walk out. These habits you have to change,

00:22:29.204 --> 00:22:32.612
we are yogis
and we have to worship the Sun.

00:22:32.813 --> 00:22:36.542
So we have to get up much before the Sun rise.

00:22:36.743 --> 00:22:39.694
That is very important.

00:22:39.895 --> 00:22:43.192
But I find that is not here. People don’t understand.

00:22:43.393 --> 00:22:46.116
They want to take Sahaja Yoga in a very slow way

00:22:46.316 --> 00:22:50.983
and you will move very slowly and so many of you will drop out I tell you.

00:22:51.184 --> 00:22:57.741
One must understand.Today is a new year’s
day and we must understand what are we doing.

00:22:57.942 --> 00:23:02.022
This is a real warning to all of you.

00:23:02.223 --> 00:23:05.964
You just try, this is not a very big thing. You will be amazed now.

00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:08.577
CP is having a conference for twenty days,

00:23:08.777 --> 00:23:12.552
every day he gets up at four thirty, every day, sleeps at twelve o’clock,

00:23:12.753 --> 00:23:16.079
every day the whole day he is working. Twenty days after all he says

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:21.674
“once in a while I have to work hard”.

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:25.829
Our servant gets up at five thirty every day, who works very hard.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.000
Why can’t you get up? You people think that you are

00:23:30.201 --> 00:23:34.120
the most unhealthy people or what is the reason?

00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:39.523
Every time you say ‘haaah’. What’s wrong with you?

00:23:39.723 --> 00:23:43.436
Nothing is wrong, you are lazy lumps that’s all, you should understand.

00:23:43.637 --> 00:23:47.115
Just tell yourself "we are lazies, extremely lazy

00:23:47.316 --> 00:23:52.435
and we have been brought up like this". And this
comes from your ego, for your information.

00:23:52.636 --> 00:23:57.222
Ego thinks, thinks, thinks, justifies everything, makes you weak

00:23:57.423 --> 00:24:02.253
and then you sleep like logs of
woods. What is going to happen?

00:24:02.454 --> 00:24:07.109
This is tamasa, complete tamasa, ego is taking you to tamasa.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.823
Or, when you are not inactive, then what we do

00:24:11.023 --> 00:24:16.952
is to ride a big horse, John Gilpins, we met so many.

00:24:17.152 --> 00:24:22.288
I went to Toronto, there is one John Gilpin. Mr. Patrick.

00:24:22.488 --> 00:24:24.804
Was a real John Gilpin, without any single pie,

00:24:25.004 --> 00:24:30.552
he became a big administrator of money, this, that.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.239
Then I find here, Mr. Jason is touched by him.

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:38.115
This is another John Gilpin, I call them what you call,

00:24:38.316 --> 00:24:42.149
James Bonds.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.155
They are riding such horses.

00:24:45.356 --> 00:24:48.374
So there is one group which is extremely

00:24:48.575 --> 00:24:54.385
fundamentalist about lethargy. You see, they know all the excuses,

00:24:54.586 --> 00:24:59.525
how to say to Mother “oh! this is so, we have this problem", this, that.

00:24:59.726 --> 00:25:04.326
The another group is this, riding the high horse.

00:25:04.527 --> 00:25:07.280
“Mother, I have to still clear out, this is the problem”.

00:25:07.481 --> 00:25:11.798
What are you doing about it? Let us face ourselves!

00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:16.874
Are we going to lag behind?

00:25:17.075 --> 00:25:20.195
You know, on a ship you have to get on to the gangway at least.

00:25:20.396 --> 00:25:22.985
If you move so slowly, gangway will be lifted

00:25:23.185 --> 00:25:26.147
and the ship will move out, I’m telling you.

00:25:26.348 --> 00:25:29.337
So one has to understand and we have to work something for Sahaja.

00:25:29.538 --> 00:25:32.280
Sahaja Yoga should be first priority. Job is first priority,

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.993
making money is first priority, or wife or children,

00:25:37.193 --> 00:25:42.028
all these are much more important. Then go ahead with it.

00:25:42.229 --> 00:25:45.057
Marriages, another is marriage.”Mother when am I going to”

00:25:45.258 --> 00:25:47.807
People will eat my head for that also.

00:25:48.008 --> 00:25:51.369
“When am I going to get married, what should I do, whom should I marry, do that”

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:58.874
These things are not going to take you
higher. Where should be your attention?

00:25:59.512 --> 00:26:05.965
Those who are married are troublesome, those who are not married are troublesome.

00:26:06.166 --> 00:26:09.279
Those who are married have problems, and those who are not married.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.545
So the marriage doesn’t solve the problem of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:12.746 --> 00:26:16.326
Now they’ll say “but we…” Excuse is there. “We must create children”.

00:26:16.527 --> 00:26:19.662
All right. Which children? Children which will be realized souls.

00:26:19.863 --> 00:26:24.096
Do you think realized souls will be born to lazy lumps?

00:26:24.297 --> 00:26:31.455
They’ll keep them morning till evening if they are born, I tell you.

00:26:31.656 --> 00:26:34.680
So one has to understand that either you are lazy

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.239
and when you are active, you are James Bonds. Nothing in between.

00:26:40.439 --> 00:26:43.352
And that’s how people have been avoiding taking responsibility.

00:26:43.553 --> 00:26:46.640
Excuses. The whole brain system is such

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.440
how to give excuse, which is anti our progress.

00:26:51.641 --> 00:26:55.244
It’s destructive, this will destroy you.

00:26:55.445 --> 00:26:58.749
This is destructive.

00:26:58.957 --> 00:27:02.128
And this tamasa has to be conquered by willpower.

00:27:02.328 --> 00:27:04.564
But if I’ll say willpower then suddenly I find

00:27:04.765 --> 00:27:09.148
ten James Bonds standing before me – “Now what?”

00:27:09.349 --> 00:27:13.689
Your poor Mother is blasted. Oh God! Now what am I to do?

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.890
So I don’t know which way to go.

00:27:16.091 --> 00:27:20.327
Now if you tell somebody that you have got some catches,

00:27:20.528 --> 00:27:24.484
you go and look after yourself, go away from here,

00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:30.420
then that person starts thinking that “I
am the person who is to be like an outcast”,

00:27:30.621 --> 00:27:35.280
and indulges into all kinds of miserable existences.

00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:41.928
It is said that you go and get yourself alright, and cleaned
up. Instead of that, person is the most miserable person

00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:46.915
and the slightest pretext, you see, you find the person thinks he is in hell.

00:27:47.126 --> 00:27:54.104
Now what to do with such people? You just tell me what is the solution for these people.

00:27:54.305 --> 00:27:58.778
Now I am already sixty years of age, how
long do you want me to live? I don’t know.

00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:04.906
But whatever it is you have to now get up.

00:28:05.107 --> 00:28:10.286
Neither to be aggressive nor to be sleeping.

00:28:10.487 --> 00:28:14.643
And this sleeping business has to go
away. Now in the ashram people stay here.

00:28:14.844 --> 00:28:17.926
Anywhere, there is no discipline in our ashram.

00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:20.640
You go and ask them what sort of ashram’s they have.

00:28:20.841 --> 00:28:23.653
3.30 one has to get up and then what do they do?

00:28:23.853 --> 00:28:28.283
You have to clean all the compound, 3.30 in the morning in New York,

00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:31.538
which is the coldest place. You see a lady told me, she is a very rich lady.

00:28:31.739 --> 00:28:37.265
She told me “3.30 I had to get up
and clean the whole compound

00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:42.183
and planting all the things and that was sold by the guru

00:28:42.383 --> 00:28:45.519
and all the money was taken by the guru himself.”

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.385
So the whole business was how to make the guru prosperous.

00:28:50.586 --> 00:28:54.885
And they had to get up early in the morning and go on working it out,

00:28:55.086 --> 00:28:57.851
one after another.

00:28:58.052 --> 00:29:01.094
There were two people who came from Rajneesh

00:29:01.295 --> 00:29:04.928
with the same dress, you see. So these people told them

00:29:05.129 --> 00:29:08.005
that you can’t come to Mother’s program with this dress.

00:29:08.206 --> 00:29:11.715
So they said we have only these two pairs of this dress

00:29:11.915 --> 00:29:17.549
and one mala left with us. The rest is all gone to guru for his Rolls Royces.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.038
So we have nothing left, only this much we have left. So I said

00:29:21.238 --> 00:29:24.404
“All right baba, we will give you money now, but change this dress”.

00:29:24.605 --> 00:29:31.078
This is the situation. That is how the gurus extract them.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:34.482
But we do not try. How far have we gone? You must think.

00:29:34.683 --> 00:29:38.290
Now, somebody who is a left sided person should think

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.260
how far we have gone now, as our left sidedness is concerned.

00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:45.723
Those who are right sided should think how far we have gone,

00:29:45.923 --> 00:29:51.079
how far in the center we have come and then think of the ascent.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.605
Sahaja Yoga is simple, made easy, all right.

00:29:54.813 --> 00:29:57.229
Supposing I have cooked for you, all right,

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:02.399
you have to eat it, digest it and use that for something.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.908
This cooking is done for the good of others. But people think of

00:30:06.108 --> 00:30:14.171
their family, house, children this, that, all these comforts.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:23.360
So one has to really, dedicatedly, absolutely understand that

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.909
our worth is much more than any one of these people put together.

00:30:29.109 --> 00:30:32.242
I’ll say my husband is working like this, I am seeing it and I am surprised.

00:30:32.443 --> 00:30:36.105
4.30 he gets up and yesterday, we had a dinner till 12 o’clock.

00:30:36.305 --> 00:30:41.101
He was so alert and talking to them in such an alert way to these Chinese.

00:30:41.302 --> 00:30:45.185
And every day he is doing that.

00:30:45.386 --> 00:30:48.575
How does he do it? You know that when I sleep

00:30:48.776 --> 00:30:52.200
also I am working and when I am awake I am working.

00:30:52.401 --> 00:30:54.817
All the time I am working. All right, you might say

00:30:55.018 --> 00:30:57.018
Mother you are Adi Shakti.

00:30:57.219 --> 00:31:02.955
But this my husband is not even a realized soul, like you people are.

00:31:03.156 --> 00:31:08.664
There are so many like that. And he is not aggressive by any chance.

00:31:08.865 --> 00:31:11.262
So once they start working, they start thinking

00:31:11.462 --> 00:31:16.779
how to make money out of Sahaja Yoga, just imagine!

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:22.210
Selling candles, selling this. What are these other side of it?

00:31:22.411 --> 00:31:25.217
I mean you cannot sell Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:25.418 --> 00:31:28.117
That is one thing I want to tell you and proclaim today

00:31:28.317 --> 00:31:31.920
that anybody tries to do such a thing I’ll liquidate that person

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.276
and make him a pukka pauper.

00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:38.615
First of all you will get sick if you try to sell Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:38.816 --> 00:31:41.720
Nobody has to do such things. You have to keep that side

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.435
extremely clear cut, you cannot sell anything.

00:31:46.635 --> 00:31:49.494
Also, whatever I am talking you cannot sell it in the market.

00:31:49.694 --> 00:31:53.384
Many people have this habit of selling it out.

00:31:53.592 --> 00:31:55.989
Now somebody is writing a poetry about Rama,

00:31:56.189 --> 00:32:00.870
what is the need to publish that poetry? What has it got to do with Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:01.071 --> 00:32:07.729
I am living here, you are writing
about Rama. What is the need?

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.168
And who wants to hear that? Just think of it.

00:32:11.369 --> 00:32:13.761
Gregoire said, “Mother we want to publish your lectures

00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:19.127
and why are they publishing somebody’s poetry there about Rama?”

00:32:19.328 --> 00:32:24.884
Is this the job we are going to do? What is our job?

00:32:25.085 --> 00:32:31.280
Is to give realizations to others,
spread Sahaja Yoga, keep ourselves pure,

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.676
At a higher level become those great personalities,

00:32:35.877 --> 00:32:40.081
you see, which have achieved something. Learn music. I told you learn music,

00:32:40.282 --> 00:32:47.816
learn dancing, learn something by
which you can manifest Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:48.017 --> 00:32:55.914
Otherwise, I don’t know what’s going to
happen to you and to Sahaja Yoga in the West

00:32:56.115 --> 00:33:01.471
because there is no education or discipline here.

00:33:01.672 --> 00:33:07.355
We are free people, do what we like.
We have to discipline ourselves.

00:33:07.555 --> 00:33:11.251
And now as you are newly born, you can do it.

00:33:11.452 --> 00:33:17.068
You have to discipline, “how dare I do these things, I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:20.578
We have to take ourselves to task, first of all.

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:25.512
This is a very, very important thing and I find that is lacking so much.

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:32.611
And you know this disease of lethargy
or of high handedness is so contagious.

00:33:32.812 --> 00:33:36.237
Mr. Patrick met Jason for five minutes he clicked him,

00:33:36.437 --> 00:33:39.486
Mr. Jason met another one, he clicked him

00:33:39.687 --> 00:33:42.497
and if I find a link, you know, it is there.

00:33:42.698 --> 00:33:47.640
One lady like Jane, she meets somebody, she becomes bhootish.

00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:53.003
She becomes bhootish,then another person… You can link it back.

00:33:53.204 --> 00:33:55.759
You’ll be amazed, how these things work out.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.463
They have a chain reaction.

00:33:59.664 --> 00:34:03.212
So one has to be careful. But why not see to the person

00:34:03.412 --> 00:34:12.688
who is doing something about it, who is rising higher, who is dynamic?

00:34:14.134 --> 00:34:17.534
I know who are there.

00:34:17.735 --> 00:34:22.031
They are the people I have now said these are your leaders,

00:34:22.232 --> 00:34:26.284
but some of them still go like that.

00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:29.286
You must assume your powers; that’s the point I’ve been saying.

00:34:29.486 --> 00:34:34.849
We have to assume our powers, we have to be wise people, grown up, matured;

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:39.004
we cannot play like children with ourselves.

00:34:39.205 --> 00:34:42.312
And this is what has been said many a times,

00:34:42.512 --> 00:34:47.158
but now whatever I’ve said it you put it in your action.

00:34:47.359 --> 00:34:49.831
Fight with yourself. Don’t give excuses.

00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:53.634
There are excuses and excuses which you tell me I said “All right”.

00:34:53.835 --> 00:34:58.245
But, you see, I have another nature which you have not realized,

00:34:58.476 --> 00:35:01.412
I can recede!

00:35:01.613 --> 00:35:04.479
My interest is up to a point. What can I do?

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:08.952
After some time like a glue, you know, it falls off.

00:35:09.153 --> 00:35:11.477
A glue can stick you to a point.

00:35:11.677 --> 00:35:16.096
If you get stuck well and good, otherwise it will fall off.

00:35:16.297 --> 00:35:23.599
So that recession should not start in my mind.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:28.401
So please be alert

00:35:28.602 --> 00:35:32.267
and don’t worry what other problems you have.

00:35:32.468 --> 00:35:37.209
Also I have seen that there are forces working like this.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.367
Now, somebody wants to do something,

00:35:39.568 --> 00:35:42.188
because he wants to do it you should not cut it out.

00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:46.623
On principle if it is good you should say “Go ahead, we are with you”.

00:35:46.824 --> 00:35:50.310
And that’s why, I see, people don’t work out. Like getting an ashram,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.640
any place will work out if everybody has positive attitude,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.406
if somebody is trying for that every collective thing.

00:35:56.606 --> 00:36:01.883
But everybody will say: “But, you see, if you take the ashram

00:36:02.083 --> 00:36:05.340
then who will pay for it? We are only five people.”

00:36:05.541 --> 00:36:09.349
But Mother is there to look after you.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:13.489
Then will be another excuse something coming up that:

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.953
“You see, if you take the ashram there could be such and….”

00:36:16.153 --> 00:36:19.880
But you just take it first of all and see for yourself.

00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:25.622
Like you start driving and you say: “All right, we are going this way,

00:36:25.823 --> 00:36:28.760
but there could be a jam”. But let us see if there is or not.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.272
Before hand how are you saying? I mean before facing the situation,

00:36:32.472 --> 00:36:38.791
there will be ten suggestions immediately coming like a cock.

00:36:40.393 --> 00:36:46.375
Jack in the box suddenly will start, you see, giving their wise advice,

00:36:46.576 --> 00:36:50.012
cutting the legs of the people who are trying to do something.

00:36:50.212 --> 00:36:54.597
It’s a very common experience I have had with Myself also.

00:36:54.798 --> 00:36:57.297
We are going now, see, in the car; I mean throughout America,

00:36:57.497 --> 00:37:00.512
I have been telling people, “Now will you please shut up.

00:37:00.713 --> 00:37:05.934
Will you please now understand, let us do it.”

00:37:06.488 --> 00:37:15.487
They decided to have a program after this program was over.

00:37:15.688 --> 00:37:19.989
It was in, I think, Vancouver. And I said, all right

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.451
then call them also for puja because we have no time now

00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:26.156
to wait till they grew up and all that, call them for puja."

00:37:26.357 --> 00:37:28.640
And I said come and have lunch also. They’ve got a fright!,

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.372
“Mother we have not made any arrangements”. I said, “What is there, we will make chola”.

00:37:32.573 --> 00:37:35.596
We have no cholas, how to soak it? I said “Don’t you worry.”

00:37:35.797 --> 00:37:39.427
I told them, “Let us go to some Indian restaurant here and we’ll get the chola.

00:37:39.627 --> 00:37:41.700
They said “it’s not possible Mother, who will…?”.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.575
I said “But let us go, I’m saying, let us go”.

00:37:44.775 --> 00:37:47.444
There was a discussion about it for about half an hour.

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.678
“Oh! Mother is saying but how to..?” I said,

00:37:49.879 --> 00:37:52.859
“Will you please take me to some Indian restaurant, anywhere?”

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.279
“Oh we have to drive about 3 miles.” I said, “Doesn’t matter”.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.338
“It’s already 11.30 it will be 12 o’clock by the time we go there,

00:38:00.538 --> 00:38:02.969
there won’t be anybody”. I said, “I am telling you

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.142
take me to some Indian restaurant, why don’t you take?”

00:38:06.343 --> 00:38:08.791
And the argument was on and on. I said, “Now, will you take Me?”

00:38:08.991 --> 00:38:12.340
I felt like taking a pistol.

00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:17.560
And now, I said, “Hands up. Let’s…”

00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:22.615
And when I insisted too much then very reluctantly they drove Me down.

00:38:22.823 --> 00:38:25.990
There was a restaurant there, I said, “Now go inside and tell this man

00:38:26.191 --> 00:38:33.942
that we want five kilos of this cholas with you if you have got chana.”

00:38:34.143 --> 00:38:37.205
So he said “I have got it.” They said, “Better get it for us”.

00:38:37.406 --> 00:38:39.881
So he sold us. And he said, “I don’t know why I am selling it you,

00:38:40.081 --> 00:38:44.082
I never do that way, but I am selling it to you”. And he gave us.

00:38:44.283 --> 00:38:49.269
And then he said “There’s a shop here” And he asked the person

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:54.647
to open the shop and he gave us all the rest of it and
next day we had a nice cholas, I’ve made them for them.

00:38:54.848 --> 00:38:58.062
So we had it. But before starting they really,

00:38:58.262 --> 00:39:01.207
I tell you, they ate my head off.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:05.148
Same in Toronto, Toronto was much worse, much worse.

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:08.474
Everywhere I found this is the thing. You try to do something:

00:39:08.675 --> 00:39:10.725
"Now you have to take this ashram",

00:39:10.926 --> 00:39:13.800
there will be ten wise people immediately sitting

00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:20.126
“But for this how can we do it?” Then you don’t have it.

00:39:21.773 --> 00:39:25.813
All these explanations and all these things are not wanted.

00:39:26.013 --> 00:39:29.519
If you have any positive things to do, you do it.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.338
The thing is, is more talking and doing nothing is the point.

00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:38.693
Action is to be taken instead of that inaction, in such a way

00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:43.019
that it’s only thought, thought, thought, thought, thought

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:49.045
and everybody’s talking. But the system where one person talks and the rest listen

00:39:49.246 --> 00:39:51.885
always works out, like in Japan, in India,

00:39:52.086 --> 00:39:54.302
if an elder is talking, nobody talks.

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:58.271
All right! If Mother says so, all right. Go ahead”.

00:39:58.472 --> 00:40:02.482
I mean Gagangan Maharaj asked these people Modi and all that

00:40:02.682 --> 00:40:06.653
“Will you jump in the sea if Mother says so? Are you willing to die for Her?”

00:40:06.854 --> 00:40:09.908
I mean this is the first question a guru asks, you see?

00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:13.110
Here? Dying? Only driving up to three miles,

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:18.867
you have to break your neck with them. Dying is too much.

00:40:19.068 --> 00:40:23.840
I cannot even talk of that. But even for everything it is happening

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.667
and that’s why Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work out.

00:40:26.868 --> 00:40:28.960
And those people who try to do something,

00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:34.430
either there is jealousy or pulling him down or the wise counseling.

00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:40.488
“If you do it who will pay for it?” There
is Mother sitting, She will look after.

00:40:40.689 --> 00:40:45.724
“You should not take the ashram on hire, this will be too much for us”.

00:40:45.924 --> 00:40:48.985
Everything, if it is free is very good.

00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:51.428
Now these are the two points I am saying the third point,

00:40:51.628 --> 00:40:58.425
also I have to tell you and then I’ll tell you the good news.

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.251
Now the third point which is very important,

00:41:05.451 --> 00:41:09.783
one has to understand about third point.

00:41:09.984 --> 00:41:17.524
It’s a very small thing but expresses in a big way in everybody’s life.

00:41:17.725 --> 00:41:23.678
Now, you people are much more affluent than Indians are,

00:41:23.879 --> 00:41:28.864
but the amount of headaches I have with Sahaja Yogis about money,

00:41:29.064 --> 00:41:32.719
I’ve never had in India which I must tell you very frankly.

00:41:32.919 --> 00:41:35.986
First we had the ashram, you know in Dollis Hill,

00:41:36.186 --> 00:41:41.352
for which I don’t know how much money I had to shell
out. I think thousand five hundred or something.

00:41:41.553 --> 00:41:44.821
Second ashram we had, we had to sell out, again there.

00:41:45.022 --> 00:41:49.282
Now third ashram we had I think here also I had to do it.

00:41:49.482 --> 00:41:51.899
The reason is there is no proper account.

00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:54.583
Nobody knows how much money is there in the bank or not.

00:41:54.784 --> 00:42:00.375
And everybody is trying to save if possible at the cost of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:00.576 --> 00:42:04.344
I mean this is such a low thing to talk about but it is so.

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:07.563
Everybody sees to one’s own personal comfort

00:42:07.763 --> 00:42:12.904
but not to the whole working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:18.039
Like so many have not even paid the rent.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.448
I mean are we going to go in litigation now,

00:42:20.648 --> 00:42:23.666
when these people who have not even paid the rent?

00:42:23.867 --> 00:42:26.599
I mean just think of it, you have not even paid the rent.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.433
Like in Dollis Hill they never paid the electricity, who is going to pay?

00:42:29.633 --> 00:42:32.533
Mother will pay, She does everything for us.

00:42:32.734 --> 00:42:37.107
You see Mother is looking after us, isn’t it? So let Her pay for the electricity.

00:42:37.308 --> 00:42:42.868
Now here it is that people have not paid the rent.

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:48.364
But for Dharma, for this great work, you have to donate.

00:42:48.564 --> 00:42:51.949
No question of paying for your rent, you have to donate. Do you understand?

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:57.621
That is one of the principles of Lakshmi.

00:42:59.253 --> 00:43:05.648
These people have not understood this. You have to donate for this work.

00:43:06.977 --> 00:43:11.100
You just think that Sahaja Yoga is for your advantage,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.633
all right, for spiritual advantage.

00:43:13.834 --> 00:43:16.320
But you do not take advantage of Sahaja Yoga this way.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.496
In India I never had this problem of money, I can tell you, this way,

00:43:20.697 --> 00:43:25.688
never, on the contrary, whenever there was a problem, they stood by Me.

00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:29.075
Australia, same thing I must say, Australia has never given Me

00:43:29.275 --> 00:43:35.863
any problem of money that I have to pay out of my pocket.

00:43:36.064 --> 00:43:38.137
Here the people have not paid the rent.

00:43:38.338 --> 00:43:43.055
Now those who have not paid the rent let, raise your hands.

00:43:43.256 --> 00:43:49.616
Honestly. So far. In the ashram.

00:43:51.016 --> 00:43:55.199
Everyone has paid?

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.025
- How much?
- Seven pounds

00:43:58.226 --> 00:44:04.400
That’s all, that’s not much; but it’s eight hundred pounds.

00:44:06.228 --> 00:44:09.158
One must pay for Sahaja Yoga, lavishly.

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:12.067
You are staying here, pay for that.

00:44:12.268 --> 00:44:15.414
You see, I have seen people, just turn their faces.

00:44:15.615 --> 00:44:18.586
You are staying here. Free food is very good idea,

00:44:18.787 --> 00:44:23.167
if you can get even free lodging, London very good.

00:44:23.368 --> 00:44:26.225
You have come for the program, so what?

00:44:26.425 --> 00:44:29.456
You have come here, now there’s food, is all, pay for that.

00:44:29.657 --> 00:44:36.038
You must pay. You don’t understand today is the day of Diwali,

00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:43.248
where people have to pay to God, God’s work.

00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:47.450
Because Lakshmi tattwa is like that.

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:51.263
You don’t have to pay the guru. Thank God, you have free guru here.

00:44:51.464 --> 00:44:55.766
Only 5p this time I took, isn’t it?

00:44:56.943 --> 00:45:01.657
But you have to pay, not only for yourself but for your work.

00:45:01.857 --> 00:45:05.403
You don’t even pay for yourself, you stay here free of food.

00:45:05.604 --> 00:45:08.571
Think people have not paid for food. Many a times it happened.

00:45:08.771 --> 00:45:14.420
They don’t even pay for the hall, one pound can you imagine?

00:45:14.621 --> 00:45:18.599
You try to save that one pound and you will be losing thousands of pounds,

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:25.764
I tell you, don’t do like that. This is
God’s work, don’t take advantage of it.

00:45:25.964 --> 00:45:28.924
And it was very far, very far I’ve seen.

00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:32.986
We used to have one Indian who would come to our pujas

00:45:33.186 --> 00:45:36.397
and he would buy things for the puja. Gavin is here, he’ll tell you.

00:45:36.606 --> 00:45:41.334
And it was impossible to pay him that money for that puja things that he bought.

00:45:41.535 --> 00:45:44.439
He said this much my punya.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.153
Even CP understands that very well. He says this is the only way

00:45:48.353 --> 00:45:54.081
I’m doing some punya. After all what punya I’m doing?

00:45:54.282 --> 00:45:56.645
While we try to save money out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:56.846 --> 00:46:01.991
is a very dangerous thing. Now, so far everything forgiven.

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:04.379
Why I don’t declare Myself to be Adi Shakti?

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.418
because once I declare Myself as Adi Shakti,

00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:12.878
none of the sins will be forgiven, take it from Me.

00:46:13.079 --> 00:46:20.267
Is a very serious thing. All of them will be alert, is already said.

00:46:20.467 --> 00:46:24.358
That’s why I don’t say I am Adi Shakti, better keep at a lower level,

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:29.337
so that at least you have given a chance.

00:46:29.538 --> 00:46:34.120
There is a mess of money everywhere. How can it be with all of you

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:40.537
so good, so intelligent, giving wise advice everywhere?

00:46:40.738 --> 00:46:43.738
And most of it is miserliness.

00:46:43.939 --> 00:46:48.430
It’s so sickening, you know, to see a saint to be miserly, I’ve said hundred times,

00:46:48.631 --> 00:46:51.844
a saint cannot be a miserly person.

00:46:52.045 --> 00:46:55.444
That’s one of the signs of a saint is that he cannot be miserly.

00:46:55.644 --> 00:46:57.911
So much thinking of money.

00:46:58.112 --> 00:47:01.558
“If you can go this way one pound you can save”.

00:47:01.759 --> 00:47:04.314
The money mindedness is so much.

00:47:04.514 --> 00:47:07.998
I have seen it every day, you see, people used to work with me.

00:47:08.207 --> 00:47:10.611
“We are not buying that paint because if we use

00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:13.830
the whole of the bottle then we cannot return it”.

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:17.681
I mean to that extent what was the need to bother?

00:47:17.882 --> 00:47:23.365
I mean the mind is such.

00:47:24.597 --> 00:47:26.893
So don’t save that kind of a thing.

00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:30.852
Labour saving devices, money saving devices, you see,

00:47:31.053 --> 00:47:34.352
are very well built in, very clever people.

00:47:34.553 --> 00:47:36.562
But they are all against you.

00:47:36.762 --> 00:47:40.382
You are so clever that you are cheating yourself.

00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:45.280
Don’t cheat yourself. Be careful. You are special people,

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.616
you have to achieve special results with yourself,

00:47:49.817 --> 00:47:54.920
you can do a lot but these are the things you should be careful.

00:47:55.136 --> 00:48:00.872
Everyone who keeps the accounts, who sends the money,

00:48:01.072 --> 00:48:04.840
who pays the money, has to be careful also.

00:48:05.041 --> 00:48:08.799
And also the people who are taking

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.569
advantage of Sahaja Yoga should be.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.828
There are many books which I have given to people I don’t know

00:48:15.029 --> 00:48:18.414
when did they sell. Except for Gavin I don’t think anybody

00:48:18.614 --> 00:48:21.207
has given me a proper account of the books that were given to him.

00:48:21.408 --> 00:48:28.027
Somebody asked me for ten, twenty, I just trusted, I trust people.

00:48:28.228 --> 00:48:32.408
Or if they could buy, you see, one Nirmala Yoga.

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:35.684
“Oh we can share Mother about hundred people can have Nirmala Yoga,

00:48:35.885 --> 00:48:39.996
it’s all right”. Yes, that’s very common,

00:48:40.197 --> 00:48:46.208
imagine Nirmala Yoga costs you three pound per year,

00:48:46.409 --> 00:48:56.109
used by hundred people, economical. But that’s the Bible.

00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:00.473
Nobody has the sense what we are going to collect.

00:49:00.674 --> 00:49:05.715
They’ll collect coins, they’ll collect I don’t know what, stamps,

00:49:05.915 --> 00:49:10.172
I don’t know what else they are collecting here, quite mad people.

00:49:10.373 --> 00:49:14.824
But why not collect Nirmala Yoga?

00:49:15.025 --> 00:49:18.228
I mean, I read it, Myself I read my own articles,

00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:22.561
every time I find a new message.

00:49:22.762 --> 00:49:26.541
While people have one Nirmala Yoga going round and round and round.

00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:32.285
One Nirmala Yoga I saw once, here in the, all torn, tattered this thing

00:49:32.485 --> 00:49:38.429
and I could see all the hands that have been laid on it.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:41.920
Because If you can save three pounds per year why not do it?

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:48.373
We’ll have the Nirmala Yoga as well.
Same thing about tapes, Mother’s tapes,

00:49:48.573 --> 00:49:51.580
"All right, If you have one, can you lend me?”

00:49:51.781 --> 00:49:56.302
By the time it ends up, there is nothing left on the tape.

00:49:56.503 --> 00:50:03.180
Is this the way to come to God? To the Generous of generous?

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.457
There is no place for such a people.

00:50:06.658 --> 00:50:11.398
God doesn’t like miserly people to enter into His Kingdom.

00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:13.599
And when you have money.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:19.221
I would say that if you are poor people who are starving.

00:50:19.557 --> 00:50:22.988
When I started my work in Bombay they all said, “Mother,

00:50:23.188 --> 00:50:26.711
how will You do it alone?” I said ”I’ll manage, don’t you worry.”

00:50:26.912 --> 00:50:29.147
And they said “We want to give you money”. I said “I don’t want.

00:50:29.347 --> 00:50:33.059
Just now there is no trust, nothing, let us form a trust”.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.686
When the trust started also

00:50:35.886 --> 00:50:39.373
you must know that I paid lot of money for the trust, Myself.

00:50:39.574 --> 00:50:44.998
We started the trust, in trust we started paying.

00:50:45.199 --> 00:50:48.316
Then, when we had established properly,

00:50:48.517 --> 00:50:51.806
I said now you can pay.

00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:57.151
That year...
[Marathi]

00:51:04.447 --> 00:51:09.664
that moment when I was sitting down, I said now I want money,

00:51:09.864 --> 00:51:13.996
there were not so many Sahaja Yogis, fifteen thousand rupees,

00:51:14.197 --> 00:51:17.716
collected that moment I was sitting there.

00:51:17.928 --> 00:51:21.306
“What did you do?” “Mother did everything.” “We didn't do it”.

00:51:21.506 --> 00:51:24.847
“Did you sell any ornament?” “Nothing.” “Then how?”

00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:27.947
“We had collected, because you had said that you will be asking

00:51:28.147 --> 00:51:31.347
some time, we have got it.” Cash, they brought.

00:51:31.548 --> 00:51:37.511
Fifteen thousand. In one sitting, just like
this I was talking, said fifteen thousand.

00:51:37.712 --> 00:51:41.052
and they sorted that paid. Here it is just on the meeting they’ll say,

00:51:41.252 --> 00:51:44.099
“all right, we will pay fifteen thousand tomorrow, day after.”

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:50.491
A person has to go after you to ask for money like a tax collector.

00:51:50.692 --> 00:51:53.816
This is absurd. “Mother I’ve got a very good house, I’ve got

00:51:54.016 --> 00:51:58.683
a very good wife, come and visit my house, I’ll be very happy”.

00:51:58.884 --> 00:52:02.999
What have you done for the Big House? You got your own house,

00:52:03.199 --> 00:52:08.519
all the blessings, what have you done for the Big House?

00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:13.110
One must understand that these are symbolic things

00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:16.029
which express your temperament, your nature.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.931
When you are taking drugs you are spending so much money for drugs,

00:52:19.131 --> 00:52:24.964
because you are addicted to it. Why not get addicted to Sahaja Yoga?

00:52:25.165 --> 00:52:29.032
How many of you are addicted to Sahaja Yoga?

00:52:29.232 --> 00:52:31.588
Raise your hands. Raise your hands.

00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:34.685
At least promise me from today you are all going to be

00:52:34.886 --> 00:52:40.514
Sahaja Yoga addicted. Come along, raise your hands, all of you.

00:52:40.715 --> 00:52:45.365
So this is the good news.

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:57.791
So, New Year has started and it’s a beautiful thing,

00:52:57.991 --> 00:53:01.101
this year has to be something special.

00:53:01.302 --> 00:53:07.852
The first thing I was thinking about the
school that you are going to establish

00:53:08.053 --> 00:53:14.262
and which is going to help you and your children very much, to begin with.

00:53:14.463 --> 00:53:19.496
And then we’ll be having different ashrams and different places.

00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:23.357
Another good news is that we have now got the land

00:53:23.558 --> 00:53:27.617
near the Neera river where you jumped into that river

00:53:27.818 --> 00:53:31.202
and the photograph of that time when you jumped in, is just like this

00:53:31.403 --> 00:53:36.264
in the sky, you find, the light all going
on the sides with rays, it’s wonderful,

00:53:36.464 --> 00:53:43.002
as you see of the Holy Ghost, exactly like that. It’s a photograph.

00:53:43.203 --> 00:53:48.296
It was with Dhumal I think, it was an instant photograph.

00:53:48.497 --> 00:53:54.093
So that land we have got where you all can have your huts,

00:53:54.293 --> 00:53:58.420
nicely done, for all of you. It’s already arranged.

00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:04.563
It’s a beautiful spot, we’re all going to have that nice time, no time.

00:54:04.764 --> 00:54:08.929
And our old age is now being completely secured,

00:54:09.129 --> 00:54:15.942
so don’t worry about the old age, don’t try to save for your old age.

00:54:21.811 --> 00:54:28.486
Now we are going to India for which we have got two programs

00:54:28.687 --> 00:54:34.368
and please try to make it easier for Me. Don’t make it difficult.

00:54:34.592 --> 00:54:36.748
And if you make it easier for Me it’s better for Me,

00:54:36.949 --> 00:54:40.591
because even if I have to worry about everything then it’s difficult.

00:54:40.792 --> 00:54:44.012
Like, we are thinking to have you on a plane,

00:54:44.212 --> 00:54:47.471
which will bring you there in time. Now you can imagine,

00:54:47.672 --> 00:54:51.039
you come at a time whenever you feel like at random,

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.444
you want to go back at a time when you want to.

00:54:54.644 --> 00:54:58.756
There should be some understanding that taking you to the airport

00:54:58.957 --> 00:55:02.776
from any place takes about thousand rupees sometimes

00:55:02.976 --> 00:55:05.777
and who is going pay for it? Extra?

00:55:05.978 --> 00:55:08.674
But you want to go to the aeroplane, you must tell:

00:55:08.874 --> 00:55:11.292
“Mother, I have to go, I have to catch the plane, what am I to do?”

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.819
Now, that’s not the way. This time all of you are going

00:55:15.019 --> 00:55:18.755
by one plane and coming back by one plane.

00:55:18.956 --> 00:55:22.542
We cannot have buses for each and individual persons

00:55:22.742 --> 00:55:25.820
and you know how taxis are expensive in India.

00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:29.080
We cannot arrange that. We’ll try to make most of you

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.672
arrive at a time when there will be a bus.

00:55:32.873 --> 00:55:35.775
Moreover, if there is an arrangement that is possible,

00:55:35.975 --> 00:55:40.039
we might be able to get a proper concession from Air India

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.065
so that when you come back, mostly now Delhi we are not going,

00:55:43.265 --> 00:55:45.901
so it won’t happen to that extent I am sure.

00:55:46.102 --> 00:55:52.095
Like merchants, you see? And carrying luggage,

00:55:52.295 --> 00:55:56.917
every person two hundred kilos,

00:55:57.118 --> 00:56:01.583
will be lessened of course, also Air India will be kind enough

00:56:01.783 --> 00:56:04.876
to help us out with little extra luggage.

00:56:05.077 --> 00:56:11.602
But the way people carry their luggage sometimes it’s… I can’t understand.

00:56:11.803 --> 00:56:15.863
Two hundred kilos were given once upon a time to me extra

00:56:16.064 --> 00:56:21.615
by Air India because of CP’s position whatever it is

00:56:21.816 --> 00:56:24.257
and that was also used by Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:24.457 --> 00:56:26.562
Then all my things were left there

00:56:26.762 --> 00:56:31.132
and they just walked off with my luggage concession

00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:34.360
and those things had to come by ship or by some other people

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:37.351
for whom I had to pay a lot, doesn’t matter.

00:56:37.552 --> 00:56:40.745
Whatever has happened is the past so forget the past.

00:56:40.945 --> 00:56:46.510
But is the new life, you should not have all the filth of the old life.

00:56:46.711 --> 00:56:53.014
So every year one has to jump out on to a better life,

00:56:53.215 --> 00:56:59.490
a life of magnanimity, of sublimity, of spirituality.

00:56:59.691 --> 00:57:05.735
And of spirituality means no sympathy at all for a bhoot.

00:57:05.936 --> 00:57:10.352
That’s one thing is definite, no sympathy!

00:57:10.553 --> 00:57:13.040
This should be decided today that

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:18.865
you will have no sympathy for any bhootish person.

00:57:19.066 --> 00:57:21.698
Because when he sits on your head then you start saying

00:57:21.898 --> 00:57:24.995
Mother this has happened, but when you give sympathy to that person

00:57:25.196 --> 00:57:29.456
you don’t understand that you have been doing these things to a person who is anti God.

00:57:29.657 --> 00:57:34.506
All bhoots are anti God,
whether they are in you or outside.

00:57:34.706 --> 00:57:41.764
So fight them out in you or outside.
Don’t allow any bhoots to be dominating,

00:57:41.965 --> 00:57:45.923
and once you understand this point that they are against God

00:57:46.123 --> 00:57:48.800
and you are the instruments of God,

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.385
you have nothing to do with them, you will get rid of them.

00:57:53.586 --> 00:57:58.144
Once you become firm, they just run away.

00:57:58.345 --> 00:58:01.487
So this second resolution has to be passed today

00:58:01.687 --> 00:58:04.972
that we’ll have no sympathies with bhootish people

00:58:05.172 --> 00:58:09.206
and will not give funny council by which you stop the work.

00:58:09.407 --> 00:58:13.127
Many people are bhootish that way, I know that. Anything you tell them,

00:58:13.328 --> 00:58:15.983
like Channe, I said let us start a school.

00:58:16.183 --> 00:58:18.740
“Oh, how can we do it, this is this, this is that”.

00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:23.197
I said in Geneva “You start taking that big place.”

00:58:23.397 --> 00:58:27.411
Many people came with great council, I know everything what has happened,

00:58:27.612 --> 00:58:30.495
you may not tell me. I am not there, but I am there.

00:58:30.696 --> 00:58:32.936
I know all those people who tried these tricks,

00:58:33.136 --> 00:58:35.097
because they think they are very wise.

00:58:35.298 --> 00:58:38.327
At this time I am there to watch you and see you,

00:58:38.527 --> 00:58:42.822
but I witness you. But you will drop out.

00:58:43.023 --> 00:58:46.287
This is the point, everything is recorded, whatever you are doing.

00:58:46.487 --> 00:58:51.209
God has a registration office and how
many marks you get is very important.

00:58:51.409 --> 00:58:57.325
You don’t think that you have been given realization, such a big position;

00:58:57.526 --> 00:59:01.247
then God is not watching you.
He is watching your every step.

00:59:01.448 --> 00:59:05.119
There are angels with you to help you and there are Ganas with you,

00:59:05.319 --> 00:59:09.360
but also the registration office is registered.

00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:12.396
So be careful. Then later on you will say that

00:59:12.596 --> 00:59:16.168
Mother I’ve missed the bus. There I can’t do any hanky panky,

00:59:16.369 --> 00:59:19.752
I tell you, at that point, I cannot do anything.

00:59:19.953 --> 00:59:23.178
Only thing just now whatever is possible I can do it,

00:59:23.378 --> 00:59:27.968
so please work it out in such a way that you really ascend fast

00:59:28.169 --> 00:59:32.248
and this is today you decide.

00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:40.171
Tonight. How many are going to get up
tomorrow at four o’clock, raise your hands.

00:59:40.372 --> 00:59:44.020
And have their baths before puja?

00:59:44.221 --> 00:59:47.213
And of course everything, not only bath,

00:59:47.414 --> 00:59:49.903
otherwise they’ll say “we had the baths, so it’s all right”. No.

00:59:50.104 --> 00:59:55.735
But in proper dresses, you have to be there in time.

00:59:55.936 --> 00:59:58.372
Actually so many times I come late because I know

00:59:58.572 --> 01:00:01.666
they must not have yet got up.

01:00:01.867 --> 01:00:04.108
What’s the use of reaching there? Then when I reach, they say

01:00:04.308 --> 01:00:09.000
“Mother stop, still is not yet done, we have not arranged.”

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:12.822
It has happened many a time, so you don’t blame Me for coming late,

01:00:13.022 --> 01:00:15.000
it’s just to give you facilities.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.845
I think that is better to go late so that there’s no problem.

01:00:22.522 --> 01:00:25.380
So the good news I have told you already

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:31.538
that we are going to get beautiful huts for ourselves.

01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:34.538
I would like you people to give Me some good designs

01:00:34.738 --> 01:00:37.071
for your huts that you want to buy.

01:00:37.272 --> 01:00:40.200
It will be at a very, very nominal cost, but don’t try to save there.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.407
You see, is the saving of savings.

01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:45.118
Like this $400 actually I did it

01:00:45.319 --> 01:00:49.444
under a wrong impression. I didn’t know that it was $375 last year.

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:52.678
I thought it was only $300, so I said 100 rupees sufficient to increase.

01:00:52.878 --> 01:00:55.189
Now they are all called, shocked, “Mother, what are you doing,

01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:57.755
how can it be? The prices have gone doubled now.”

01:00:57.955 --> 01:01:01.840
I said “Somehow or other I will manage, don’t you worry.” But,

01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:05.650
in the hut business also you must know

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:09.626
you have to pay for your hut, you cannot get it free there.

01:01:09.835 --> 01:01:12.614
Or, “Mother it’s all right, one person will build

01:01:12.814 --> 01:01:17.254
and we’ll come every year, we can share.

01:01:17.455 --> 01:01:23.254
It’s all right, you make one hut for us, ten persons can share it”.

01:01:23.455 --> 01:01:26.617
This kind of beggaring should not be expressed there.

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:30.039
It’s quite common here, “we’ll share it, it’s all right”.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.359
But where are you going to spend your money that saving all this?

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.105
You won’t shave because you want to save money,

01:01:36.305 --> 01:01:39.105
you won’t go to a hairdresser you want to save money, all right.

01:01:39.306 --> 01:01:41.522
Now you don’t want to pay for your food,

01:01:41.722 --> 01:01:43.741
because you want to save money, you don’t want to pay your rent

01:01:43.941 --> 01:01:46.120
because you want to save money, but for what?

01:01:46.321 --> 01:01:48.814
I can understand drunkards doing that because, you see,

01:01:49.014 --> 01:01:51.735
miserly people are around because they are drunkards you know.

01:01:51.936 --> 01:01:54.635
Drunkards always have to save money because they have to drink.

01:01:54.835 --> 01:01:58.269
But you are no more drunkards now, so why should you save?

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.760
Only drunkards do like that, you see this curse,

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.967
this miserliness is very much in England and all the places,

01:02:04.168 --> 01:02:07.462
this is the reason, because they have to drink, you know, where will they get the money to drink?

01:02:07.663 --> 01:02:10.114
So they save all their money for drinking.

01:02:10.314 --> 01:02:12.417
But you are not drunkards any more.

01:02:12.618 --> 01:02:16.331
And the thing that you are drinking is the nectar which is free.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:21.459
So why are you saving all the time your money?

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.497
So money making propositions and money saving proposition,

01:02:25.697 --> 01:02:28.119
if they brought little low,

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.236
you’ll be amazed that these are all joy killing.

01:02:31.437 --> 01:02:34.587
Bhoots are joy killing things. A bhootish woman,

01:02:34.788 --> 01:02:39.983
if she is next to Me, you see, I want to run away, can’t bear her.

01:02:40.184 --> 01:02:43.127
The reason is she’s so joy killing, she’ll go on saying

01:02:43.327 --> 01:02:46.567
“Mother, what is happening about my marriage now?

01:02:46.768 --> 01:02:48.916
My husband has not written any letter to me.”

01:02:49.116 --> 01:02:51.150
Finished. I’m saying – “Now, fed up of her.”

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:54.724
Then another will talk “Mother my house is not all right,

01:02:54.924 --> 01:02:58.811
what am I to do? My business is not working out, what am I to do?”

01:02:59.012 --> 01:03:04.658
All very personal petty things they’ll discuss. Not of higher things.

01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:08.013
But in America I was so much happier

01:03:08.213 --> 01:03:14.224
that they never asked Me about personal problems, no one.

01:03:14.432 --> 01:03:17.933
Always talked about the higher thing. “But how is it, Mother?

01:03:18.133 --> 01:03:21.449
This is the Spirit, when it comes into you,

01:03:21.649 --> 01:03:23.945
how is it the light is not spread so well?”

01:03:24.146 --> 01:03:26.875
They talked about Spirit, Spirit, Spirit, nobody said

01:03:27.075 --> 01:03:30.000
“My husband is like this, my house is sinking,

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.515
what am I to do? I have problems”.

01:03:33.716 --> 01:03:38.796
They never talked like that, so they’ll go much faster

01:03:38.997 --> 01:03:41.534
and you will stay stick on with your wives, children

01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:46.607
and your house and maybe I don’t know what else here.

01:03:46.808 --> 01:03:52.615
So be careful. Move your attention to higher levels.

01:03:52.816 --> 01:03:55.195
Unless and until you move your attention to higher levels,

01:03:55.396 --> 01:04:00.202
how will you jump out?

01:04:03.881 --> 01:04:08.263
And this is another way you can give a lift to the newcomers also.

01:04:08.463 --> 01:04:12.169
You see, many newcomers are shocked by the Sahaja Yogis the way they are.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.437
They say “there is no difference.

01:04:14.638 --> 01:04:17.712
They tell lies, they try to save money at our cost”.

01:04:17.912 --> 01:04:21.063
New people have come, “All right, are you a married man?”

01:04:21.264 --> 01:04:23.793
Then they say “all right! You pay for today.”

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:27.852
We go to a hotel, he pays for them. The new man is shocked.

01:04:28.053 --> 01:04:30.852
All the Sahaja yogis eat there, poor fellow he pays money.

01:04:31.053 --> 01:04:33.656
He is without any money, then he thinks "What sort of Sahaja Yogis these are,

01:04:33.857 --> 01:04:38.671
they are making me pay.” When a
new person comes you all should pay.

01:04:38.871 --> 01:04:41.847
But if they know somebody has money then they take out the money.

01:04:42.048 --> 01:04:46.482
This is a horrible thing to hear. And the whole problem is of money,

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:49.015
“my husband doesn’t give me the money, he keeps the money

01:04:49.215 --> 01:04:51.642
at the bank, my wife doesn’t give me money”.

01:04:51.843 --> 01:04:55.528
I am fed up of all these talks. Now no more after this,

01:04:55.728 --> 01:04:59.555
at least don’t tell Me. If you want I can give you two sticks,

01:04:59.755 --> 01:05:03.989
you hit your husband or your wife, finish it off. I have nothing to say,

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:08.510
but don’t tell Me about them.

01:05:08.711 --> 01:05:12.992
And if your wife is a bhoot or a husband is a bhoot keep her out.

01:05:13.202 --> 01:05:17.052
Don’t take a headache on yourself. And those who are marrying

01:05:17.253 --> 01:05:19.674
because they’re in-love with bhoots better give up.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.560
Otherwise, their love affairs, and this and that,

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.963
all sorts of things, I am so fed up with it.

01:05:27.164 --> 01:05:34.224
When are we going to talk about the eternal life?

01:05:34.425 --> 01:05:38.568
All right? So, I think for New Year,

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:43.112
we have had a little pep talk and a love talk and good news

01:05:43.313 --> 01:05:45.981
maybe we may be allowed to stay here if you all desire,

01:05:46.181 --> 01:05:52.556
if you do not give some wise counseling, I am sure we’ll stay here.

01:05:52.757 --> 01:05:56.550
All right, when shifting here also there were lot of wise counseling,

01:05:56.750 --> 01:06:02.702
“It’s very far away, what should we do, this, that” It worked out.

01:06:02.903 --> 01:06:06.746
Keep your wisdom to yourself, work it out on yourself.

01:06:06.946 --> 01:06:09.254
Try to find out about yourself through your own wisdom,

01:06:09.454 --> 01:06:12.812
“What am I doing?” And you’ll be amazed how it will help you.

01:06:13.012 --> 01:06:19.349
You have to shine. You are the leaders of tomorrow.

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:24.696
You have to have your wings on. What are you doing?

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:31.158
All these heavy loads throw them away, nothing important.

01:06:31.359 --> 01:06:34.023
Feel lighter. You have given up all that.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:37.534
Now we are yogis, we are sanyasis,

01:06:37.734 --> 01:06:41.454
what is going to matter with us, even if you don’t get food, so what?

01:06:41.655 --> 01:06:47.353
God is going to look after us. He looks after us.

01:06:49.356 --> 01:06:54.414
And it is happened with people that they have all settled down very well

01:06:54.614 --> 01:06:58.255
those who have faith in their yoga,

01:06:58.456 --> 01:07:02.296
they get their kshema all right. First look after your yoga, is important.

01:07:02.497 --> 01:07:05.858
That’s the most important thing to look after your yoga

01:07:06.058 --> 01:07:13.044
by which you do not falter into the ditch of this greed

01:07:13.245 --> 01:07:16.204
and lust and all those things that are surrounding us.

01:07:16.405 --> 01:07:19.067
Try to lead a life which is detached.

01:07:19.267 --> 01:07:24.418
Detachment one has to develop. Detachment.

01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:27.512
Complete detachment is needed.

01:07:27.712 --> 01:07:30.703
Today I had a mind of bringing some present for you,

01:07:30.904 --> 01:07:33.400
because, you see, I love it, I love to give you presents.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.199
I don’t know why. That’s an attachment I have.

01:07:39.871 --> 01:07:43.990
But I said this today I’ll just have little more detachment about it,

01:07:44.191 --> 01:07:47.519
because if I give it to few then they will be angry.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.315
But I had a mind to give you some presents specially,

01:07:50.515 --> 01:07:59.047
but I’ll give you some special wishes today

01:07:59.248 --> 01:08:04.943
that let your willpower become enlightened;

01:08:05.144 --> 01:08:15.965
let you become the people with great enlightened faith

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:23.398
and with enlightened strength.

01:08:23.598 --> 01:08:29.331
You shed off all these things of the past,

01:08:29.532 --> 01:08:42.432
come out of your shells, come out of your past conditionings

01:08:42.632 --> 01:08:46.432
and without jumping towards your ego,

01:08:46.632 --> 01:08:50.763
cleanse yourself completely, spread your wings

01:08:50.964 --> 01:09:01.711
and like a dignified bird you enjoy the ocean of God’s bliss.

01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:07.448
This is what I bless you.

01:09:11.956 --> 01:09:17.535
The sky, the sky is the limit. There is no limit to your enjoyment,

01:09:17.743 --> 01:09:20.195
but drop out all these nonsensical things. Just drop out.

01:09:20.395 --> 01:09:24.490
You are saints, you are yogis, all of you are.

01:09:24.691 --> 01:09:27.703
You are not ordinary mundane people on the street.

01:09:27.903 --> 01:09:31.270
Everybody’s feet are to be worshipped, you are of that level.

01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:34.614
Your Mother has made you like that after Ganesha.

01:09:34.815 --> 01:09:39.820
And what are you doing? Where are you lost?

01:09:40.021 --> 01:09:42.900
Take the responsibility.

01:09:43.101 --> 01:09:47.825
May God bless you all!
