00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:15.618
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:21.621
we have gathered here

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:28.986
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.079
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.227
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:48.500
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:53.216
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:01:00.045
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:06.113
and that you can do this Puja performed.

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:09.264
It's your right.

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:13.280
You are chosen for this.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.433
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:19.899
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.451
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

00:01:30.475 --> 00:01:39.318
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:55.133
These are specially created cells

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:59.255
through the working of the Swadishthana.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:03.653
Passing through all the chakras,

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:06.950
when they arrive at Sahasrara

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:15.382
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:24.557
without getting involved into

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:29.298
other elements in the body.

00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:38.728
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:45.947
are not to be involved with the other cells -

00:02:46.148 --> 00:02:50.149
human beings,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.709
of the body of this universe.

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:03.613
The first thing that happens

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:07.819
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.887
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.398
So, many things he transcends:

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.372
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.815
Time is his slave.

00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:28.929
If you have to go somewhere

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.240
then suddenly you discover

00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:43.058
that everything is working about the same time

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.938
when you are able to do it.

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:55.769
Like you are, say, to catch a train

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.637
and you arrive late at the station,

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:04.583
you find the train is late for you.

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:11.567
Things work out in such a way that you feel

00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:19.252
they are all acting for your complete convenience.

00:04:19.453 --> 00:04:23.960
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:28.138
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:34.165
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:37.084
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:38.949
you just don't do it.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.167
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:49.964
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.727
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:58.558
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:06.272
either with lust,
greed, at something,

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:10.072
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

00:05:10.273 --> 00:05:22.704
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:27.623
means the attention loses its dharma.

00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:36.830
The dharma of the attention are such that

00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:42.504
we have to put

00:05:42.705 --> 00:05:48.087
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

00:05:49.338 --> 00:05:55.103
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

00:05:55.434 --> 00:06:02.656
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

00:06:02.857 --> 00:06:07.739
and when they attack us,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.342
then

00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:19.161
we have to have some measures to control it.

00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:24.330
So we build up our dharmas,

00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:28.367
our rules and regulation,

00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:31.814
and control them, the dharmas,

00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:36.882
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

00:06:37.526 --> 00:06:41.286
This is the greatness of human beings,

00:06:41.487 --> 00:06:48.137
that they have made their own dharmas

00:06:48.338 --> 00:06:51.305
established on top of the lower dharmas.

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:55.670
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:58.009
It has to be in four valences;

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.795
it acts according to the four valences,

00:07:00.996 --> 00:07:04.040
it cannot make it six.

00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:09.872
But human beings can make

00:07:10.073 --> 00:07:13.341
those valences established which are supposed to be

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:18.315
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.667
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:26.782
means, you don't have need,

00:07:26.983 --> 00:07:30.075
there’s no need,

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:34.715
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

00:07:34.916 --> 00:07:37.043
You don't have to discipline,

00:07:37.244 --> 00:07:40.575
but you get disciplined automatically.

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:44.225
That is the first sign of a person

00:07:44.426 --> 00:07:49.811
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.702
Attention doesn't get attached

00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:58.321
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

00:07:58.522 --> 00:08:04.123
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:11.030
So you become ‘kalateet’.

00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:13.642
You become ‘dharmateet’.

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.921
You become ‘gunateet’.

00:08:17.327 --> 00:08:21.856
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

00:08:22.057 --> 00:08:26.373
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:32.680
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:35.537
of your attention.

00:08:35.738 --> 00:08:42.223
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

00:08:42.424 --> 00:08:47.408
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:56.488
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

00:08:56.689 --> 00:09:01.815
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

00:09:02.016 --> 00:09:04.781
which is ‘satvika’.

00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:10.001
Where a person tries to control

00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:17.004
all his enemies of lust, anger,

00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:24.194
pride, vanity, attachments

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:27.176
and greed.

00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:35.037
All these restrictions

00:09:35.238 --> 00:09:39.149
on the attention get lost

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:45.677
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

00:09:45.878 --> 00:09:51.206
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

00:09:53.548 --> 00:10:01.137
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

00:10:01.338 --> 00:10:05.789
and you become ‘satgunis’-

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.648
means virtuous,

00:10:09.849 --> 00:10:16.463
but not by discipline,

00:10:16.664 --> 00:10:20.149
but spontaneously.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.726
You become righteous spontaneously.

00:10:23.927 --> 00:10:27.317
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

00:10:27.518 --> 00:10:31.796
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:39.472
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:43.735
in the sense, in front of the temples.

00:10:45.648 --> 00:10:49.869
According to laws, we should not have temper,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.443
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

00:10:56.644 --> 00:11:00.863
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

00:11:01.064 --> 00:11:07.425
which is not to be analyzed,

00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:12.201
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:16.987
the killing of the rakshasas,

00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:20.390
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:24.559
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.556
they are all dead already.

00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:34.641
They all get explained because you go beyond.

00:11:34.842 --> 00:11:39.355
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

00:11:39.556 --> 00:11:43.383
Only the one who can control is beyond.

00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:47.459
The one who is in it cannot control it.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:54.016
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

00:11:54.217 --> 00:12:00.870
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

00:12:01.071 --> 00:12:04.961
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:19.297
But, when it comes to the knowledge

00:12:19.498 --> 00:12:24.355
about such a person, you cannot think,

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:31.954
because such a person is beyond thinking.

00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:34.954
You cannot describe

00:12:35.155 --> 00:12:39.834
because such a person cannot describe.

00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:46.289
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.732
take the poison?

00:12:53.717 --> 00:12:58.092
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.544
That's beyond human comprehension.

00:13:05.536 --> 00:13:08.491
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:12.561
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

00:13:12.762 --> 00:13:17.228
Your certificates come from God Almighty

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:22.780
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:28.801
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

00:13:35.937 --> 00:13:38.483
So you reach a state

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:41.598
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:44.900
means ‘without’,

00:13:47.838 --> 00:13:50.275
without.

00:13:53.002 --> 00:13:57.671
So such a person

00:13:57.872 --> 00:14:02.262
is without thought; he doesn't think.

00:14:09.168 --> 00:14:13.125
Such a person is without greed,

00:14:13.326 --> 00:14:18.638
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:26.867
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

00:14:27.068 --> 00:14:36.374
out of which nothing is left out.

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:40.601
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

00:14:40.802 --> 00:14:44.542
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

00:14:44.743 --> 00:14:49.344
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:53.269
because it reaches a point all the time

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:58.089
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.993
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

00:15:02.418 --> 00:15:08.152
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

00:15:10.485 --> 00:15:16.875
Vacuum of all the negative,

00:15:17.076 --> 00:15:23.745
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:34.401
Such a person is eternal being.

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:39.201
Nobody can kill,

00:15:39.402 --> 00:15:45.276
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:52.247
The anger

00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:58.313
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

00:15:58.514 --> 00:16:02.442
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

00:16:02.643 --> 00:16:14.535
He is not elated by praises

00:16:14.736 --> 00:16:20.580
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.866
the moods of the ego.

00:16:36.706 --> 00:16:43.033
So the third state where he reaches,

00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:48.938
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nih’ –

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:51.024
Nihi.

00:16:53.872 --> 00:16:59.147
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

00:16:59.348 --> 00:17:05.074
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:08.962
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:12.571
But the word is 'Nihi'.

00:17:12.772 --> 00:17:16.326
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

00:17:19.254 --> 00:17:21.444
‘nih’ -

00:17:21.645 --> 00:17:27.764
that means

00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:30.621
‘sheer’.

00:17:34.691 --> 00:17:42.331
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

00:17:45.442 --> 00:17:52.036
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:59.471
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:12.672
Like when you say

00:18:12.873 --> 00:18:20.713
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:23.328
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:28.818
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

00:18:31.574 --> 00:18:35.644
But this word is used,

00:18:35.845 --> 00:18:38.987
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

00:18:39.188 --> 00:18:47.956
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

00:18:48.157 --> 00:18:54.118
without or devoid of.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:18:59.828
The another form is:

00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:03.474
the only - absolute;

00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:09.301
the absolute.

00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:16.134
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:19.003
nothing but joy.

00:19:19.204 --> 00:19:22.180
It's complete freedom.

00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:26.517
So you have all kinds of joys,

00:19:26.718 --> 00:19:32.946
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

00:19:33.147 --> 00:19:36.967
the joy of the Spirit.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:45.138
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

00:19:46.382 --> 00:19:49.370
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

00:19:49.571 --> 00:19:54.344
where you have the joy of the play.

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:01.571
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:04.444
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

00:20:04.645 --> 00:20:08.676
means, sheer absolute joy.

00:20:10.313 --> 00:20:14.091
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:17.570
it means absolute.

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:20.752
So when you put such an adjective before

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:24.643
anything else it becomes absolute.

00:20:36.067 --> 00:20:39.746
Thus you become absolute.

00:20:42.934 --> 00:20:48.663
And when you are at that state of absolute

00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:55.074
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

00:21:01.716 --> 00:21:05.747
But let us see what is absolute.

00:21:11.172 --> 00:21:15.252
That means it is not relative;

00:21:15.453 --> 00:21:17.807
it has no relative qualities.

00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:23.158
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:26.069
it cannot be compared.

00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:31.923
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

00:21:35.053 --> 00:21:38.551
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

00:21:38.752 --> 00:21:42.286
anything else through which we can comprehend;

00:21:42.487 --> 00:21:45.166
it is absolute.

00:21:49.479 --> 00:21:55.403
Whatever way you try to know it

00:21:55.604 --> 00:21:59.814
you go away from absolute.

00:22:03.237 --> 00:22:10.722
Whenever you try to analyze the absolute, you are away from it.

00:22:21.004 --> 00:22:26.453
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

00:22:28.509 --> 00:22:32.015
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

00:22:32.216 --> 00:22:36.354
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:41.008
means the anand of the body,

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:49.703
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

00:22:53.753 --> 00:22:56.533
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

00:22:56.734 --> 00:23:01.124
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

00:23:03.062 --> 00:23:06.476
But the state has now

00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:10.663
to be established within us is of Niranand.

00:23:11.936 --> 00:23:16.389
Then what is the question of fear?

00:23:19.163 --> 00:23:22.081
What is the question of talking about it?

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:27.166
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:31.851
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:36.582
There are no words for absolute to describe.

00:23:36.783 --> 00:23:39.402
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

00:23:39.603 --> 00:23:42.970
what remains is absolute.

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:50.758
So you reach the state of absolute.

00:23:53.844 --> 00:23:56.289
And that is the state

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:01.447
a complete communication is established

00:24:01.648 --> 00:24:06.384
and in that communication you have nobody else

00:24:06.585 --> 00:24:09.858
but the absolute within you.

00:24:16.626 --> 00:24:20.672
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:26.046
That is the level to which you should aspire.

00:24:27.556 --> 00:24:32.823
That should be the ascent,

00:24:33.024 --> 00:24:37.555
which should be established within ourselves.

00:24:38.672 --> 00:24:41.106
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:24:41.307 --> 00:24:44.725
we don't have to do anything drastic.

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:50.387
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:54.509
the only, ‘kevalam’.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:04.599
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

00:25:06.862 --> 00:25:13.760
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

00:25:13.961 --> 00:25:19.953
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

00:25:20.566 --> 00:25:25.292
Just by surrendering you become.

00:25:26.854 --> 00:25:30.794
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:38.159
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.849
It is absolute love,

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.550
it is absolute compassion;

00:25:46.751 --> 00:25:50.581
it is absolute power.

00:26:03.699 --> 00:26:06.005
The words stop,

00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:10.581
the description stops.

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:15.569
You just become the absolute

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:22.616
and feel your absoluteness through it

00:26:22.817 --> 00:26:26.207
with that oneness.

00:26:28.106 --> 00:26:33.113
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:37.882
There’s no company needed.

00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:44.286
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

00:26:50.214 --> 00:26:56.758
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

00:26:56.959 --> 00:27:03.294
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

00:27:08.592 --> 00:27:11.991
May God bless you.
