WEBVTT

00:02.598 --> 00:15.618
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

00:15.819 --> 00:21.621
we have gathered here

00:21.822 --> 00:28.986
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

00:34.590 --> 00:38.079
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

00:38.280 --> 00:43.227
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

00:43.428 --> 00:48.500
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

00:48.701 --> 00:53.216
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

00:53.417 --> 01:00.045
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

01:00.246 --> 01:06.113
and that you can do this Puja performed.

01:06.741 --> 01:09.264
It's your right.

01:09.475 --> 01:13.280
You are chosen for this.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.433
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

01:17.634 --> 01:19.899
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

01:20.100 --> 01:27.451
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

01:30.475 --> 01:39.318
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

01:49.655 --> 01:55.133
These are specially created cells

01:55.334 --> 01:59.255
through the working of the Swadishthana.

01:59.585 --> 02:03.653
Passing through all the chakras,

02:03.854 --> 02:06.950
when they arrive at Sahasrara

02:07.151 --> 02:15.382
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

02:15.583 --> 02:24.557
without getting involved into

02:24.758 --> 02:29.298
other elements in the body.

02:32.757 --> 02:38.728
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

02:38.929 --> 02:45.947
are not to be involved with the other cells -

02:46.148 --> 02:50.149
human beings,

02:50.350 --> 02:54.709
of the body of this universe.

02:59.281 --> 03:03.613
The first thing that happens

03:03.814 --> 03:07.819
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

03:08.020 --> 03:12.887
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

03:13.419 --> 03:17.398
So, many things he transcends:

03:17.599 --> 03:21.372
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

03:21.573 --> 03:24.815
Time is his slave.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.929
If you have to go somewhere

03:29.130 --> 03:35.240
then suddenly you discover

03:35.441 --> 03:43.058
that everything is working about the same time

03:43.259 --> 03:46.938
when you are able to do it.

03:47.361 --> 03:55.769
Like you are, say, to catch a train

03:55.970 --> 03:59.637
and you arrive late at the station,

03:59.838 --> 04:04.583
you find the train is late for you.

04:06.518 --> 04:11.567
Things work out in such a way that you feel

04:11.768 --> 04:19.252
they are all acting for your complete convenience.

04:19.453 --> 04:23.960
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

04:24.246 --> 04:28.138
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

04:28.339 --> 04:34.165
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

04:34.366 --> 04:37.084
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

04:37.285 --> 04:38.949
you just don't do it.

04:39.150 --> 04:44.167
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

04:47.335 --> 04:49.964
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

04:50.165 --> 04:52.727
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

04:52.928 --> 04:58.558
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

04:58.759 --> 05:06.272
either with lust,
greed, at something,

05:06.473 --> 05:10.072
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

05:10.273 --> 05:22.704
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

05:22.905 --> 05:27.623
means the attention loses its dharma.

05:28.925 --> 05:36.830
The dharma of the attention are such that

05:37.031 --> 05:42.504
we have to put

05:42.705 --> 05:48.087
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

05:49.338 --> 05:55.103
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

05:55.434 --> 06:02.656
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

06:02.857 --> 06:07.739
and when they attack us,

06:07.940 --> 06:13.342
then

06:13.543 --> 06:19.161
we have to have some measures to control it.

06:19.362 --> 06:24.330
So we build up our dharmas,

06:24.531 --> 06:28.367
our rules and regulation,

06:28.568 --> 06:31.814
and control them, the dharmas,

06:32.015 --> 06:36.882
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

06:37.526 --> 06:41.286
This is the greatness of human beings,

06:41.487 --> 06:48.137
that they have made their own dharmas

06:48.338 --> 06:51.305
established on top of the lower dharmas.

06:51.506 --> 06:55.670
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

06:55.887 --> 06:58.009
It has to be in four valences;

06:58.210 --> 07:00.795
it acts according to the four valences,

07:00.996 --> 07:04.040
it cannot make it six.

07:04.241 --> 07:09.872
But human beings can make

07:10.073 --> 07:13.341
those valences established which are supposed to be

07:13.542 --> 07:18.315
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

07:18.640 --> 07:23.667
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

07:23.868 --> 07:26.782
means, you don't have need,

07:26.983 --> 07:30.075
there’s no need,

07:30.276 --> 07:34.715
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

07:34.916 --> 07:37.043
You don't have to discipline,

07:37.244 --> 07:40.575
but you get disciplined automatically.

07:40.776 --> 07:44.225
That is the first sign of a person

07:44.426 --> 07:49.811
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.702
Attention doesn't get attached

07:52.903 --> 07:58.321
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

07:58.522 --> 08:04.123
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

08:06.991 --> 08:11.030
So you become ‘kalateet’.

08:11.549 --> 08:13.642
You become ‘dharmateet’.

08:13.843 --> 08:16.921
You become ‘gunateet’.

08:17.327 --> 08:21.856
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

08:22.057 --> 08:26.373
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

08:26.574 --> 08:32.680
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

08:32.881 --> 08:35.537
of your attention.

08:35.738 --> 08:42.223
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

08:42.424 --> 08:47.408
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

08:48.233 --> 08:56.488
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

08:56.689 --> 09:01.815
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

09:02.016 --> 09:04.781
which is ‘satvika’.

09:05.099 --> 09:10.001
Where a person tries to control

09:10.202 --> 09:17.004
all his enemies of lust, anger,

09:17.205 --> 09:24.194
pride, vanity, attachments

09:24.395 --> 09:27.176
and greed.

09:28.191 --> 09:35.037
All these restrictions

09:35.238 --> 09:39.149
on the attention get lost

09:39.350 --> 09:45.677
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

09:45.878 --> 09:51.206
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

09:53.548 --> 10:01.137
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

10:01.338 --> 10:05.789
and you become ‘satgunis’-

10:05.990 --> 10:09.648
means virtuous,

10:09.849 --> 10:16.463
but not by discipline,

10:16.664 --> 10:20.149
but spontaneously.

10:20.350 --> 10:23.726
You become righteous spontaneously.

10:23.927 --> 10:27.317
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

10:27.518 --> 10:31.796
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

10:31.997 --> 10:39.472
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

10:39.673 --> 10:43.735
in the sense, in front of the temples.

10:45.648 --> 10:49.869
According to laws, we should not have temper,

10:50.070 --> 10:56.443
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

10:56.644 --> 11:00.863
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

11:01.064 --> 11:07.425
which is not to be analyzed,

11:07.626 --> 11:12.201
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

11:12.402 --> 11:16.987
the killing of the rakshasas,

11:17.188 --> 11:20.390
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

11:20.591 --> 11:24.559
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

11:24.760 --> 11:28.556
they are all dead already.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.641
They all get explained because you go beyond.

11:34.842 --> 11:39.355
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

11:39.556 --> 11:43.383
Only the one who can control is beyond.

11:43.584 --> 11:47.459
The one who is in it cannot control it.

11:47.860 --> 11:54.016
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

11:54.217 --> 12:00.870
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

12:01.071 --> 12:04.961
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

12:10.228 --> 12:19.297
But, when it comes to the knowledge

12:19.498 --> 12:24.355
about such a person, you cannot think,

12:24.556 --> 12:31.954
because such a person is beyond thinking.

12:32.155 --> 12:34.954
You cannot describe

12:35.155 --> 12:39.834
because such a person cannot describe.

12:40.532 --> 12:46.289
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

12:46.490 --> 12:50.732
take the poison?

12:53.717 --> 12:58.092
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

13:00.060 --> 13:04.544
That's beyond human comprehension.

13:05.536 --> 13:08.491
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

13:08.692 --> 13:12.561
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

13:12.762 --> 13:17.228
Your certificates come from God Almighty

13:17.429 --> 13:22.780
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

13:22.981 --> 13:28.801
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

13:35.937 --> 13:38.483
So you reach a state

13:38.684 --> 13:41.598
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

13:41.799 --> 13:44.900
means ‘without’,

13:47.838 --> 13:50.275
without.

13:53.002 --> 13:57.671
So such a person

13:57.872 --> 14:02.262
is without thought; he doesn't think.

14:09.168 --> 14:13.125
Such a person is without greed,

14:13.326 --> 14:18.638
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

14:22.701 --> 14:26.867
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

14:27.068 --> 14:36.374
out of which nothing is left out.

14:36.575 --> 14:40.601
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

14:40.802 --> 14:44.542
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

14:44.743 --> 14:49.344
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

14:49.545 --> 14:53.269
because it reaches a point all the time

14:53.470 --> 14:58.089
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

14:58.290 --> 15:01.993
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

15:02.418 --> 15:08.152
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

15:10.485 --> 15:16.875
Vacuum of all the negative,

15:17.076 --> 15:23.745
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

15:30.339 --> 15:34.401
Such a person is eternal being.

15:34.621 --> 15:39.201
Nobody can kill,

15:39.402 --> 15:45.276
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

15:46.412 --> 15:52.247
The anger

15:52.448 --> 15:58.313
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

15:58.514 --> 16:02.442
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

16:02.643 --> 16:14.535
He is not elated by praises

16:14.736 --> 16:20.580
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

16:20.781 --> 16:24.866
the moods of the ego.

16:36.706 --> 16:43.033
So the third state where he reaches,

16:43.234 --> 16:48.938
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nih’ –

16:49.139 --> 16:51.024
Nihi.

16:53.872 --> 16:59.147
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

16:59.348 --> 17:05.074
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

17:05.275 --> 17:08.962
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

17:09.891 --> 17:12.571
But the word is 'Nihi'.

17:12.772 --> 17:16.326
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

17:19.254 --> 17:21.444
‘nih’ -

17:21.645 --> 17:27.764
that means

17:27.965 --> 17:30.621
‘sheer’.

17:34.691 --> 17:42.331
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

17:45.442 --> 17:52.036
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

17:52.237 --> 17:59.471
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

18:05.639 --> 18:12.672
Like when you say

18:12.873 --> 18:20.713
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

18:20.914 --> 18:23.328
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

18:23.529 --> 18:28.818
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

18:31.574 --> 18:35.644
But this word is used,

18:35.845 --> 18:38.987
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

18:39.188 --> 18:47.956
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

18:48.157 --> 18:54.118
without or devoid of.

18:54.319 --> 18:59.828
The another form is:

19:00.029 --> 19:03.474
the only - absolute;

19:06.747 --> 19:09.301
the absolute.

19:10.825 --> 19:16.134
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

19:16.335 --> 19:19.003
nothing but joy.

19:19.204 --> 19:22.180
It's complete freedom.

19:22.602 --> 19:26.517
So you have all kinds of joys,

19:26.718 --> 19:32.946
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

19:33.147 --> 19:36.967
the joy of the Spirit.

19:38.420 --> 19:45.138
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

19:46.382 --> 19:49.370
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

19:49.571 --> 19:54.344
where you have the joy of the play.

19:58.079 --> 20:01.571
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

20:01.772 --> 20:04.444
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

20:04.645 --> 20:08.676
means, sheer absolute joy.

20:10.313 --> 20:14.091
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

20:14.292 --> 20:17.570
it means absolute.

20:18.299 --> 20:20.752
So when you put such an adjective before

20:20.953 --> 20:24.643
anything else it becomes absolute.

20:36.067 --> 20:39.746
Thus you become absolute.

20:42.934 --> 20:48.663
And when you are at that state of absolute

20:48.864 --> 20:55.074
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

21:01.716 --> 21:05.747
But let us see what is absolute.

21:11.172 --> 21:15.252
That means it is not relative;

21:15.453 --> 21:17.807
it has no relative qualities.

21:18.008 --> 21:23.158
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

21:23.359 --> 21:26.069
it cannot be compared.

21:27.259 --> 21:31.923
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

21:35.053 --> 21:38.551
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

21:38.752 --> 21:42.286
anything else through which we can comprehend;

21:42.487 --> 21:45.166
it is absolute.

21:49.479 --> 21:55.403
Whatever way you try to know it

21:55.604 --> 21:59.814
you go away from absolute.

22:03.237 --> 22:10.722
Whenever you try to analyze the absolute, you are away from it.

22:21.004 --> 22:26.453
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

22:28.509 --> 22:32.015
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

22:32.216 --> 22:36.354
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

22:36.555 --> 22:41.008
means the anand of the body,

22:42.399 --> 22:49.703
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

22:53.753 --> 22:56.533
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

22:56.734 --> 23:01.124
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

23:03.062 --> 23:06.476
But the state has now

23:06.677 --> 23:10.663
to be established within us is of Niranand.

23:11.936 --> 23:16.389
Then what is the question of fear?

23:19.163 --> 23:22.081
What is the question of talking about it?

23:22.282 --> 23:27.166
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

23:27.367 --> 23:31.851
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

23:33.491 --> 23:36.582
There are no words for absolute to describe.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.402
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

23:39.603 --> 23:42.970
what remains is absolute.

23:46.391 --> 23:50.758
So you reach the state of absolute.

23:53.844 --> 23:56.289
And that is the state

23:56.490 --> 24:01.447
a complete communication is established

24:01.648 --> 24:06.384
and in that communication you have nobody else

24:06.585 --> 24:09.858
but the absolute within you.

24:16.626 --> 24:20.672
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

24:21.539 --> 24:26.046
That is the level to which you should aspire.

24:27.556 --> 24:32.823
That should be the ascent,

24:33.024 --> 24:37.555
which should be established within ourselves.

24:38.672 --> 24:41.106
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

24:41.307 --> 24:44.725
we don't have to do anything drastic.

24:44.926 --> 24:50.387
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

24:50.588 --> 24:54.509
the only, ‘kevalam’.

24:59.310 --> 25:04.599
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

25:06.862 --> 25:13.760
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

25:13.961 --> 25:19.953
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

25:20.566 --> 25:25.292
Just by surrendering you become.

25:26.854 --> 25:30.794
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

25:30.995 --> 25:38.159
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.849
It is absolute love,

25:43.050 --> 25:46.550
it is absolute compassion;

25:46.751 --> 25:50.581
it is absolute power.

26:03.699 --> 26:06.005
The words stop,

26:06.206 --> 26:10.581
the description stops.

26:12.519 --> 26:15.569
You just become the absolute

26:15.770 --> 26:22.616
and feel your absoluteness through it

26:22.817 --> 26:26.207
with that oneness.

26:28.106 --> 26:33.113
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

26:34.739 --> 26:37.882
There’s no company needed.

26:38.083 --> 26:44.286
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

26:50.214 --> 26:56.758
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

26:56.959 --> 27:03.294
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

27:08.592 --> 27:11.991
May God bless you.
