00:04.333 --> 00:14.623
It is very difficult to describe this inner
joy.

00:14.832 --> 00:19.178
You can only enjoy it, you can only
feel it.

00:19.379 --> 00:31.114
It's something so innate to see that
so many of you

00:31.315 --> 00:35.555
have learnt this difficult music

00:35.756 --> 00:40.226
and all of you have been enjoying it.

00:42.937 --> 00:50.980
I went to various places in the West
and I felt that,

00:51.182 --> 00:55.869
“Why even small little children,

00:56.070 --> 01:02.404
boys and girls, take to something which is
self-destructive? Why?

01:02.605 --> 01:04.896
Why do they take to drugs? Why do they take

01:05.097 --> 01:08.920
Why do they take to all these things which
are self-destructive?”

01:09.122 --> 01:12.801
I mean, you could blame the parents
to some extent

01:13.002 --> 01:18.184
but on the whole, there was something
within them which was troubling them,

01:18.385 --> 01:24.007
which was trying to say that, “That's
not true.

01:24.208 --> 01:27.768
That's not the thing, that's not the thing
that you want.”

01:27.969 --> 01:35.229
And that's what made them go into all kinds
of various types of rebellion, I should say,

01:35.431 --> 01:38.881
against all the accepted truths

01:39.082 --> 01:43.979
or accepted goodness or value system.

01:44.308 --> 01:47.581
And I just thought that, of course,
in India

01:47.781 --> 01:50.515
the parents are rather strict, I must say
'right',

01:50.716 --> 01:53.116
but there's one more thing in India:

01:53.317 --> 01:56.693
there's a big outlet for them

01:56.895 --> 02:02.930
and I found that outlet was the talent
that they had.

02:03.131 --> 02:06.423
They had lots of talents, all of them,
I felt

02:06.624 --> 02:08.652
when I talked to them and this and that.

02:08.853 --> 02:14.523
I felt that they have lots of talent but
there is no way to express it.

02:14.724 --> 02:25.831
Certain people have been doing some sort
of an haphazard expression, I should say,

02:26.331 --> 02:32.899
and they could not understand themselves
why they were doing it.

02:33.100 --> 02:37.730
And this was the main thing that was
lacking, I think, in the West

02:37.931 --> 02:42.851
that the children had no way of expressing
themselves,

02:43.052 --> 02:45.526
of expressing their talent.

02:45.727 --> 02:49.580
And this talent was making them mad,
I think,

02:49.781 --> 02:56.128
that was making them absolutely rebellious.

02:56.329 --> 02:58.598
It was not their mistake by any chance,

02:58.799 --> 03:05.820
It was an energy within which was bubbling
and had no outlet.

03:07.383 --> 03:14.520
And whatever outlet they had was not
recognized, was not appreciated.

03:15.346 --> 03:20.194
And this made me feel that if these
children are given

03:20.395 --> 03:24.673
an outlet, a means of expressing
themselves,

03:24.874 --> 03:27.008
I am sure they’ll take to it.

03:27.233 --> 03:28.876
They'll forget all these things,

03:29.077 --> 03:35.256
they'll never take to all self-destructive
ideas

03:35.457 --> 03:38.839
because they were angry with them, I think.

03:39.040 --> 03:46.212
And it worked; it worked in the sense that
first I wanted

03:46.413 --> 03:52.333
Yogi (Mahajan) to start a school for small
children.

03:52.534 --> 03:56.766
And I was surprised how these children took

03:56.967 --> 04:00.928
to another kind of lifestyle, very
disciplined style

04:01.129 --> 04:07.011
and... they were very different children.

04:07.212 --> 04:13.351
Like in the West I found a child, supposing
you take him to the shop,

04:13.552 --> 04:18.137
he'll make you mad because he will say,
“Buy me this and buy me that and...”,

04:18.338 --> 04:22.815
not understanding that one cannot
afford it.

04:23.016 --> 04:31.156
And left to himself, I would say, that he
would go on buying the whole of the market.

04:31.357 --> 04:34.709
He was so mad about it.

04:34.933 --> 04:38.152
But I thought that there was some sort
of a thing

04:38.353 --> 04:42.086
that's lacking in him, in satisfaction.

04:42.293 --> 04:50.313
On the contrary, in India if you take one
boy or a girl to the market,

04:50.515 --> 04:52.575
they'll say, “Bas, bas - only one,

04:52.776 --> 04:55.945
one will do.” Big, very big problem.

04:56.146 --> 05:00.633
I had my own granddaughters, I took them
once to Delhi

05:00.834 --> 05:03.815
because they had broken their chappals
[slippers], you know,

05:04.016 --> 05:07.815
and they had only one pair. The parents
have else to do, no problem,

05:08.016 --> 05:11.764
but one chappal of that was broken, I said,
“All right, you come along.

05:11.965 --> 05:15.969
Now in Delhi you can get good ones,
we'll buy from them.”

05:16.171 --> 05:19.832
So they came and I bought for them.

05:20.034 --> 05:23.881
They said, “Nani, at any cost we'll not
take the second one.

05:24.082 --> 05:26.966
We'll just take one.”

05:27.167 --> 05:31.253
But I said, “Supposing this breaks. Then
what will happen?

05:31.454 --> 05:35.197
Then you will come back again to Delhi
to buy chappals?

05:35.398 --> 05:37.485
Have one spare at least.”

05:37.686 --> 05:42.644
They wouldn't listen and they ran away
into the car.

05:42.847 --> 05:46.907
I went there, I said, “What are you doing?
Why don't you buy chappals for yourselves?”

05:47.108 --> 05:50.144
“Why do you want to waste your money, Nani?

05:50.344 --> 05:54.331
You can use it for something else.”

05:54.533 --> 05:59.045
Now, I was surprised the way they were
so satisfied.

05:59.246 --> 06:01.211
Of course, they are born realized,
no doubt,

06:01.412 --> 06:05.265
but also the whole atmosphere.

06:05.663 --> 06:11.263
I felt that this atmosphere if the children
from the West can get,

06:11.464 --> 06:18.574
they will definitely prosper, they'll
definitely express themselves

06:18.775 --> 06:22.556
and they'll become excellent people.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.725
But I didn't know their energy was
so much, you see.

06:25.926 --> 06:32.652
After, my brother - your Babamama -
I asked him,

06:32.854 --> 06:35.864
“Why not start an Academy of music?”

06:36.026 --> 06:39.472
And when they came to music, I was
surprised.

06:39.673 --> 06:45.896
I was really surprised when we had not
expected anything from them,

06:46.097 --> 06:48.907
within three months, within four months,

06:49.108 --> 06:54.220
they picked up such a difficult music
style.

06:54.421 --> 07:00.914
It's impossible, it's impossible for
Indians to do that.

07:01.223 --> 07:04.311
They can never do [it] in four, four
months’ time.

07:04.512 --> 07:09.441
Oh baba, I've seen in my own family, there
were musicians

07:09.642 --> 07:14.881
and my sisters, my brothers, for hours
together...

07:15.082 --> 07:22.409
Every morning they used to get up at about
five o'clock and start their music.

07:23.371 --> 07:28.840
Every day rehearse for three, four hours,
every day.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.854
And I used to think, “Now, when will this
end?”

07:31.054 --> 07:36.063
I mean, after all, if somebody has to sleep
after 5:00, you can't, just can't sleep.

07:36.264 --> 07:40.707
But that's a custom in India to get up very
early in the morning.

07:40.908 --> 07:46.607
But the way these people are learning it
so fast, it is

07:46.808 --> 07:52.688
because that urge to express themselves
was inside very, very strong,

07:52.889 --> 07:57.640
much stronger than Indians. Just imagine!

07:57.841 --> 08:02.395
I can tell you very clearly, I have never
heard of anybody

08:02.596 --> 08:08.796
learning this difficult music in three
months and four months.

08:08.997 --> 08:12.707
For years together they would not learn.

08:12.908 --> 08:18.125
Same about you people: How you have
started appreciating it,

08:18.302 --> 08:21.402
I just don't know.

08:22.153 --> 08:26.821
I mean, it's a different atmosphere that
has started,

08:27.022 --> 08:32.654
so full of hope and joy.

08:32.856 --> 08:37.591
You see now, there was one fellow who
went to Belgium.

08:37.792 --> 08:42.660
He was an Italian, Italian Sahaja Yogi.

08:42.861 --> 08:44.802
He said, “Mother, I was surprised.

08:45.003 --> 08:48.269
There was a nice program with the Indians,

08:48.470 --> 08:52.931
and the Indian Consulate had arranged,
so I went to the program.

08:53.132 --> 08:57.256
And they were talking to each other and
some of them went out,

08:57.457 --> 09:00.959
some of them came in, these Indians.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.679
They never understood that it was Pilu rag,

09:03.879 --> 09:06.454
that one they couldn't recognize.

09:06.656 --> 09:10.641
Even an ordinary Pilu rag they cannot
recognize.”

09:10.843 --> 09:14.447
I was surprised that this Italian,
that he...

09:14.648 --> 09:18.244
What he's saying is really, I've seen it.

09:18.445 --> 09:26.730
The Indians when they go for this kind
of a very deep type of music,

09:26.931 --> 09:32.065
after 15 minutes they start slipping out.

09:33.551 --> 09:38.499
Also they told me that in England they went

09:38.700 --> 09:44.654
to a music centre or we can say for
the buying of the records or something.

09:44.855 --> 09:50.586
So, all the boys who were there, who were
Indians,

09:50.787 --> 09:55.711
were buying pop music, that music.

09:55.912 --> 09:59.616
And they looked at these Sahaja Yogis,
they said, “Are you stupid fools?

09:59.817 --> 10:04.805
Why are you buying this music, this Indian
music?

10:05.006 --> 10:07.111
What is there in this Indian music?”

10:07.312 --> 10:12.428
They said, “It's better not to talk to you
because you are gone cases.”

10:12.629 --> 10:16.536
Now, you see because, somehow or other,

10:16.737 --> 10:19.798
this is a Sahaj trick I think,

10:19.999 --> 10:22.091
that your energy's tuned up

10:22.292 --> 10:27.198
to a very subtle and deep understanding
of music.

10:27.399 --> 10:30.551
Otherwise, it would never have worked
like this.

10:30.752 --> 10:34.126
I mean, is the Kundalini, of course,
no doubt.

10:34.327 --> 10:41.683
But the way she has nourished you
to absorb, to understand, to enjoy.

10:41.884 --> 10:45.808
This is very subtle music.

10:46.658 --> 10:49.655
And it has happened more with the Western
people

10:49.855 --> 10:54.462
than with the Indians, I'm sorry to say.

10:54.663 --> 11:00.916
But Indians don't have that much of
understanding, nor that much of enjoyment.

11:01.117 --> 11:08.276
Westerners may not, may not understand
but they enjoy.

11:08.714 --> 11:15.292
Indians will, those who are, I mean,
a little bit educated in music,

11:15.493 --> 11:19.456
will start finding out faults,

11:19.657 --> 11:23.108
finding out ragas, “This was not good,
that...”.

11:23.309 --> 11:30.074
No, but not Westerners: Western people
are so humble about it.

11:30.275 --> 11:32.534
Isn't it remarkable?

11:32.735 --> 11:39.276
How is it they have picked up so quickly
and have understood?

11:39.478 --> 11:41.317
Because they have become subtler.

11:41.518 --> 11:45.022
This is the only thing I can say: they have
become subtler

11:45.223 --> 11:51.550
and their energies are flowing through
the subtler level.

11:52.368 --> 11:55.892
It's surprising for Babamama, also for me,
for everyone

11:56.100 --> 12:03.255
that in three, four months how can you
play Malkauns rag?

12:04.160 --> 12:10.093
First time I heard, I started wondering,
“How can that be?”

12:10.294 --> 12:18.389
And that gives such a hope to save this
music.

12:18.919 --> 12:23.183
It may be that in India it may be
declining,

12:23.384 --> 12:28.800
but in the West it's rising.

12:29.108 --> 12:35.287
Is the other way round: The Sun rises from
the East and sets on the West;

12:35.489 --> 12:40.844
here is the other way round now for music
and I would request all the Indians

12:41.045 --> 12:45.503
to develop that subtle understanding.

12:45.705 --> 12:57.079
You see, say if you are a honeybee, only
then you can suck in the honey.

12:58.848 --> 13:02.577
The flies cannot.

13:02.921 --> 13:06.327
So you have to develop that sensitivity.

13:06.528 --> 13:09.351
I would say to Indians, I'm sorry to say

13:09.552 --> 13:13.850
that you have to develop that sensitivity
within you,

13:14.051 --> 13:17.300
which is possible through meditation

13:17.501 --> 13:24.949
and through Kundalini awakening and
balancing

13:25.151 --> 13:31.920
and ultimately getting connected with this
all-pervading power of Chaitanya.

13:32.122 --> 13:35.883
Because Sound is the second stage.

13:36.085 --> 13:38.860
First was, of course, they said the Word.

13:39.061 --> 13:43.548
But it was silent, came into Sound

13:43.749 --> 13:51.274
and if you can understand the subtle
of the Sound within you,

13:52.257 --> 14:00.803
if you can get one with it, it gives you
that joy.

14:01.004 --> 14:07.766
But you will be surprised, I have never
studied music, never, all my life.

14:07.967 --> 14:15.971
Because, you see, I don't know why but
somehow I never studied

14:16.172 --> 14:20.868
because I could not have a guru, this is
the problem was.

14:22.980 --> 14:27.816
I couldn't have a guru, so somehow or
other, I never studied music.

14:28.017 --> 14:32.146
But what I have is the same as you have now

14:32.347 --> 14:40.491
is that subtle enjoyment sense of music.

14:40.692 --> 14:43.440
And that's why I say this is divine.

14:43.641 --> 14:45.971
Of course, I also enjoy some pop music,

14:46.172 --> 14:48.891
also enjoy western music very much

14:49.092 --> 14:52.963
and the Western great composers I enjoy,
no doubt.

14:53.164 --> 14:57.437
But this music has one speciality -

14:57.638 --> 15:05.910
that nothing is written down, there is
no composer.

15:06.111 --> 15:14.026
The musician is the composer, he is
the player and he is the book.

15:14.963 --> 15:18.274
It's so individualistic if you see that,

15:18.475 --> 15:21.291
but today I was happy to see all of them.

15:21.493 --> 15:27.072
This is the western side of it

15:27.273 --> 15:30.653
that so many of them put together were
singing, you see,

15:30.854 --> 15:35.369
like a choir but not so bad as that.

15:37.398 --> 15:43.080
And in the choir, you see, because I have
attended many choirs also,

15:43.281 --> 15:47.385
it was too systematic, too disciplined;

15:47.586 --> 15:52.319
this is not. Here it is complete freedom
within themselves.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.208
And the whole thing worked out so well,
I mean,

15:55.409 --> 15:59.090
it's such a good combination of both
the things:

15:59.291 --> 16:04.301
One side is the music, another side is
the collectivity.

16:04.539 --> 16:11.098
So I have never said a word about Baba's
University or Academy,

16:11.300 --> 16:16.096
but I told him that, “I'm very proud
of you.”

16:23.189 --> 16:29.372
He has very lovingly brought up this
Academy

16:29.582 --> 16:39.122
and has that character of our old guru
system which is very important.

16:39.323 --> 16:49.014
That keeps the whole place very holy,
as you call 'pavana'.

16:49.228 --> 16:51.548
And that is working out. He is working
very hard.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.952
I know Baba is working very hard,

16:54.153 --> 16:57.484
and all of you are working very hard
to help him.

16:57.685 --> 17:03.236
But this Academy will definitely, I'm sure,
one day will give

17:03.437 --> 17:09.830
that universal knowledge of that subtle
thing I am telling you about.

17:17.444 --> 17:25.616
I know it is late today and tonight, I
should say, but I am used to this more,

17:25.817 --> 17:30.021
because, you see, in our - when we were
young -

17:30.222 --> 17:34.101
my father was so fond of music and
musicians

17:34.302 --> 17:37.683
that so many times we have slept at about
five o'clock in the morning.

17:37.884 --> 17:40.204
So, [it] makes no difference to me.

17:40.405 --> 17:44.406
Same I find in you, people, that you are,
the way you are enjoying.

17:44.607 --> 17:48.101
So we have great hope of saving our young
people

17:48.302 --> 17:55.875
who are going astray, people who are
frustrated,

17:56.076 --> 18:03.162
people who are unhappy because they have
no satisfaction;

18:03.363 --> 18:10.704
people who are committing suicide
in the affluent countries.

18:10.905 --> 18:14.355
Also in our country people who are
becoming politicians,

18:14.556 --> 18:18.851
I think, that's the worst thing that can
happen to anyone.

18:19.699 --> 18:27.390
Also we have people who are doing all kinds
of criminal things,

18:27.604 --> 18:32.711
doing all kinds of violence and everything.

18:32.912 --> 18:41.552
All that can be completely covered with
the ocean of music.

18:42.101 --> 18:45.349
And if it is done by Sahaja Yogis,

18:45.550 --> 18:51.869
it would be such a great emancipation
for the whole world

18:52.070 --> 18:57.100
which is absolutely due and it is going
to work out.

18:57.301 --> 19:00.348
So I am thankful to Babamama

19:00.549 --> 19:05.138
and to all others who are supporting
him in this

19:05.339 --> 19:14.065
and I hope you all will enjoy this music
on a very subtle level.

19:14.266 --> 19:21.044
Because immediately with the mind which
reacts, one starts discussing,

19:21.245 --> 19:26.014
arguing, condemning also.

19:26.444 --> 19:32.495
That's not the way to understand this
music, but just to enjoy it.

19:32.697 --> 19:38.647
Enjoyment - it hasn't got two sides - is
only enjoyment, single,

19:38.848 --> 19:43.606
and that should happen to you, all of you.

19:43.807 --> 19:54.295
I am so much, so much overwhelmed really
by this beautiful renderings we have had.

19:54.496 --> 19:57.091
For example now we had from Aurangabad.

19:57.292 --> 20:00.258
I mean, I can't believe that in Aurangabad

20:00.459 --> 20:03.459
you could have such beautiful dancing.

20:03.661 --> 20:11.270
This Mr. Aurangzeb, after whom this name
is given - Aurangabad.

20:11.471 --> 20:14.032
[Marathi] -

20:14.233 --> 20:17.287
I don't know why it's called Aurangabad,
whatever it is.

20:17.488 --> 20:21.056
He was such a horribly fanatic man

20:21.257 --> 20:27.127
and every day he used to kill so many
Hindus.

20:27.328 --> 20:30.655
And when... Thank God he was a thin man.

20:30.856 --> 20:35.514
He was weaved in their thread, Janaeu
thread.

20:35.715 --> 20:39.779
How many were killed, you know. Imagine
what a cruel man he was,

20:39.980 --> 20:45.202
and under his name is this Aurangabad.
If you have to change any name

20:45.403 --> 20:49.695
in this country, it should be Aurangzeb
and Aurangabad.

20:52.082 --> 20:54.317
And he had no sense of music,

20:54.518 --> 20:57.577
he never used to listen to music, you know,

20:57.778 --> 21:02.810
but he was extremely honest; that's another
point about honesty.

21:03.011 --> 21:09.666
And he would not take any money for his
survival from the state.

21:09.867 --> 21:17.547
He used to stitch topis [hats] and sell
them. Can you imagine?

21:17.748 --> 21:20.602
If he had not done that and had been

21:20.803 --> 21:23.778
little bit loving person, would have been
much better.

21:23.979 --> 21:27.883
But from that Aurangabad comes this music
and dancing.

21:28.084 --> 21:32.435
I was amazed. I thought, “How can it be?”

21:32.636 --> 21:35.250
How did they call it Aurangabad, I don't
know,

21:35.451 --> 21:39.771
but he's the one who hated music.

21:41.197 --> 21:44.779
How could these people be born there?

21:44.980 --> 21:47.867
And what dancing they showed.

21:48.115 --> 21:50.164
Also you have seen the Kuchipudi

21:50.364 --> 21:56.490
from Baba’s Institute was another one –
I must – just eye-opener, I tell you.

21:56.698 --> 22:02.037
These are girls from, absolutely from
countries

22:02.238 --> 22:04.954
where they have never known all this.

22:05.155 --> 22:09.437
And in such a short time to learn such
a dance like Kuchipudi,

22:09.639 --> 22:14.089
is the most difficult dance, very fast.

22:14.290 --> 22:16.660
“My goodness!”, I thought that,

22:16.861 --> 22:20.045
“What has happened to them?”

22:20.466 --> 22:23.340
And you may say, “Mother, this is due
to Sahaj”,

22:23.541 --> 22:30.102
whatever it is, but Sahaj also is to be
borne by you people.

22:30.303 --> 22:36.691
Now if you have a very small little candle,
how much it can burn?

22:36.892 --> 22:43.230
But these are like the ocean of energies

22:43.431 --> 22:48.821
and the way they are expressing themselves
is remarkable.

22:49.022 --> 22:51.861
Of course, I love you very much

22:52.062 --> 22:56.341
and it is not out of that love and
admiration I am saying this,

22:56.542 --> 23:00.296
but it's a fact, is a reality.

23:01.055 --> 23:07.326
I, I had no idea that one day it will go
that well

23:08.350 --> 23:17.573
and this global movement is going to work
out wonders.

23:17.775 --> 23:23.103
You must spread also the music along
with the vibrations.

23:23.304 --> 23:26.305
I am sure it would be good.

23:26.506 --> 23:32.625
Really, for definite.
(Marathi)

23:33.936 --> 23:38.159
I - you can't believe, I asked Babamama,
“Who is, how is it?”

23:38.361 --> 23:43.647
He said, “Only four months’ time.”
Everybody four months.

23:45.595 --> 23:49.047
Very remarkable. Then we have one from
Spain.

23:49.248 --> 23:51.495
I saw him playing Spanish,

23:51.696 --> 23:54.924
but Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

23:55.125 --> 23:58.204
because it goes hectic, you know.

23:58.405 --> 24:03.962
It is very fast, sometimes very slow, but
it's very rhythmic, but is hectic.

24:04.163 --> 24:08.601
Ours is very much, I should say,
disciplined.

24:08.802 --> 24:12.965
Whatever it is, he also has played so well.

24:13.166 --> 24:17.188
So there are so many examples to show,

24:17.390 --> 24:21.471
that you may be from the Western country.

24:21.710 --> 24:27.759
It's better to be from the Western country
now for music than from this.

24:30.278 --> 24:34.010
I can't understand really, it's a, it's
a miracle,

24:34.211 --> 24:41.221
but why should this miracle work in the
West and not in India I don't understand.

24:41.422 --> 24:44.453
Though I am sure the Indians are enjoying
this music,

24:44.654 --> 24:46.952
no doubt, because they are all Sahaja
Yogis.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.009
But you go to any program -

24:50.210 --> 24:53.724
any other program where there are very
few Sahaja Yogis -

24:53.925 --> 24:59.589
you will see that the way they behave,
without any respect.

24:59.821 --> 25:04.022
The respect that is paid in India to
the musicians has to be

25:04.228 --> 25:10.352
of a very high level - or any talents -
say even art...

25:10.537 --> 25:16.279
See also people who make beautiful things
from their hands.

25:16.480 --> 25:22.354
All these people who are so talented, are
to be respected very much

25:22.555 --> 25:26.510
because it's a special gift God has given
them.

25:26.711 --> 25:30.635
Now in India, we have got a very big
problem also.

25:30.836 --> 25:41.974
All great artists got into the... I should
say, into the influence of the West,

25:42.175 --> 25:50.320
and so many of them take scotch whisky.
What do you say to that?

25:51.558 --> 25:57.917
So many; and their music is finished.

25:58.118 --> 26:00.661
You can't even play cricket with scotch
whisky,

26:00.861 --> 26:04.800
leave alone music.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.801
And this Western influence of taking drinks
and things like that

26:12.002 --> 26:16.177
has ruined our musicians and I don't know
what's going to happen.

26:16.378 --> 26:19.764
I was quite worried that how is it going
to be retained

26:19.965 --> 26:23.634
in this country, but now I have great hopes

26:23.835 --> 26:27.724
because if they see the Western people
doing so well...

26:27.925 --> 26:36.085
You see, for Indians, this goes into their
heads that, “How can they do it?”

26:36.286 --> 26:38.313
Oh, that goes very much...

26:38.514 --> 26:45.734
I mean if they see Western people doing
such good music,

26:45.935 --> 26:51.938
it's very influential. So, instead of
having any Indian artist

26:52.139 --> 26:56.112
on the stage, we should really bring
foreign.

26:56.314 --> 27:01.889
It will have a great effect, I tell you,
on Indians. (Marathi)

27:03.610 --> 27:06.647
It was very shameful the way sometimes
Indians behave

27:06.848 --> 27:13.310
in a classical music programs, very
shameful, for anybody.

27:13.511 --> 27:17.332
They have no sense, nothing and they go
on misbehaving.

27:17.534 --> 27:25.064
They come there for social, social affair,
I think, that's all.

27:25.651 --> 27:29.500
On this point, we Indians as Sahaja Yogis

27:29.701 --> 27:35.725
are to be responsible and to see for
yourself

27:35.926 --> 27:45.032
how much they have achieved, how much
they have understood.

27:45.793 --> 27:48.014
Somebody who saw them said,

27:48.216 --> 27:56.289
“Mother, now even in Indian music if they
go ahead of us, what will happen to us?”

27:58.018 --> 28:01.429
But still, we have very great musicians,

28:01.630 --> 28:05.551
as you have Arun Apte before you.

28:10.349 --> 28:15.667
I must tell you, we had a program in Puna,

28:15.868 --> 28:20.076
that's called as Shere, and I was very
tired.

28:20.277 --> 28:22.973
And so I told Yogi (Mahajan), “What is
in the program, next one?”

28:23.174 --> 28:29.868
He said, “Some musician has come. He wanted
to sing, so he has come.”

28:30.069 --> 28:32.962
I said, “Which musician?” “I don't know
his name...”

28:33.163 --> 28:35.084
But you see, Yogi (Mahajan), I think, was
that time

28:35.285 --> 28:40.675
not so much music-minded. Typical
Indian style.

28:40.876 --> 28:43.673
“So Mother, You go and sleep.”

28:43.875 --> 28:48.687
So I laid down and I heard his voice
and I heard his music.

28:48.888 --> 28:54.871
I said, “Who is this singing?” I came back,
I changed my sari,

28:55.073 --> 29:00.645
I asked Yogi, “Who is he?” They told me
the name.

29:00.846 --> 29:03.740
I said, “He's a great singer!

29:03.941 --> 29:07.994
What do you understand? How much are
you going to pay him?”

29:08.195 --> 29:14.117
He told me such a meagre thing, I said,
“Are you mad, Yogi?

29:15.747 --> 29:21.671
Then I went out and I heard his great
music.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.972
I've heard his guru also before

29:24.173 --> 29:26.715
who was also very great that time,

29:26.916 --> 29:31.611
and also Ajit Kadkade is his gurubandhu,
both of them are.

29:31.813 --> 29:37.097
But I was surprised that none of
the Indians could understand him,

29:37.298 --> 29:40.144
what he was singing.

29:40.684 --> 29:47.002
And this Maharashtra is known for music,
for classical music.

29:47.203 --> 29:53.290
But surprisingly, it's not that level now
that we had seen.

29:53.491 --> 30:01.839
I am happy to see this resurrection
of Indian music through you people.

30:02.040 --> 30:13.885
That was one of my greatest desire to get
the art, handicrafts and music -

30:14.086 --> 30:21.702
all kinds of things which are created
through this talent - should prosper.

30:21.903 --> 30:27.068
And I am very happy to see that despite
it's so late -

30:27.269 --> 30:30.962
I don't know what is the time, oh my God -

30:31.163 --> 30:35.656
you all are still alert and enjoying.

30:35.833 --> 30:43.892
I can't say about other artists who have
very much impressed you and impressed me.

30:44.093 --> 30:49.704
So this is a very good chance -
Ganapatipule - where we can have

30:49.905 --> 30:56.431
a very nice music, beautiful music,
so enjoyable.

30:56.632 --> 30:59.751
Thank you very much.
