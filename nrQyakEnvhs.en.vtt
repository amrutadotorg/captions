WEBVTT

00:03.629 --> 00:07.238
On this occasion when you are all leaving
me,

00:07.439 --> 00:10.568
it’s rather hard to listen to these
qualities

00:10.769 --> 00:15.352
described in your beautiful song.

00:22.484 --> 00:32.112
My words are so loaded with a feeling
of extreme sadness,

00:33.069 --> 00:45.484
plus the exuberance of new ventures,

00:45.685 --> 00:48.656
some ideas that I have to do much more

00:48.857 --> 00:53.536
to establish whatever you are describing
me.

00:54.235 --> 01:00.232
So many rakshasa are to be killed as you
have described me.

01:01.066 --> 01:05.815
All the disparities are to be removed
from this world.

01:06.016 --> 01:08.727
All the ignorance, the darkness,
the chimera

01:08.928 --> 01:12.893
has to be removed, as you have described
me.

01:13.094 --> 01:17.772
It is very easy to destroy this world

01:18.094 --> 01:26.959
and it was easier to destroy the demons
and the devils,

01:27.182 --> 01:30.669
but today the time is so precarious

01:30.870 --> 01:37.069
that all these have entered into
the brains,

01:37.270 --> 01:43.164
the Sahasrara of many seekers.

01:43.365 --> 01:46.848
So, it’s a very delicate task

01:47.049 --> 01:53.396
to remove those horrible influences

01:53.613 --> 01:59.312
to save the seekers from the clutches
of these devils.

02:00.139 --> 02:04.599
You have been very kind to understand

02:05.659 --> 02:12.037
that it is a very delicate thing and we
cannot do it

02:12.238 --> 02:17.186
with harshness, with bluntness, with
straightforward statements.

02:17.387 --> 02:23.352
We have to take them round because they
are hard rocks

02:23.553 --> 02:28.936
and make them understand through
compassion,

02:29.137 --> 02:33.919
love and complete concern.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.582
Discretion is the only way we can manage

02:37.783 --> 02:44.745
and one has to use all kinds of methods
of discretion to save these people.

02:44.946 --> 02:48.393
Once a maximum number is saved,

02:48.594 --> 02:52.006
the rakshasas can be destroyed.

02:52.207 --> 02:56.784
As it is they are so much exposed now,
they are getting destroyed

02:56.985 --> 02:59.254
by themselves, by their own behaviour.

02:59.455 --> 03:04.047
That’s the best about the falsehood, that
it shows itself.

03:04.248 --> 03:07.955
The effects are shown.

03:09.185 --> 03:14.906
In the process we also find

03:15.107 --> 03:21.897
that the effects of these devils are still
in our behaviour sometimes lingering.

03:22.098 --> 03:26.227
So all the Sahaja Yogis who have been
to other false gurus should be careful

03:26.428 --> 03:31.124
so that they should not be any more
dominated when they are ascending.

03:31.325 --> 03:34.356
Also there are other effects of our past,

03:34.557 --> 03:38.519
our aggressiveness, our incompatibility,

03:38.720 --> 03:43.047
our anti-collective activities.

03:43.263 --> 03:45.947
All this comes from the grossness
of personality.

03:46.148 --> 03:49.380
As soon as your grossness becomes subtler
and subtler

03:49.581 --> 03:58.036
you’ll merge, dissolve into the collective
understanding, very easily.

03:58.237 --> 04:11.527
Now, the things that I have to do sometimes
looks like mountainous

04:11.804 --> 04:17.736
and I seek your help in every way.

04:17.937 --> 04:22.341
I cannot do it alone, so I seek your help

04:22.542 --> 04:26.563
and I ask for your guidance in many ways,

04:26.764 --> 04:31.064
because human beings are not easy
to understand.

04:31.265 --> 04:35.242
You have to ask human beings what they
are up to.

04:35.443 --> 04:39.271
Now, the first task is ahead of you is
to save yourself

04:39.472 --> 04:43.616
from negativity from within, from within.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.234
You might find one or two murmuring souls
here and there

04:46.435 --> 04:49.286
talking nonsense about the programme
we had,

04:49.487 --> 04:51.872
the tour we had, the way we went round,

04:52.073 --> 04:56.328
about nonsensical things, which has no
meaning to the spiritual life.

04:56.529 --> 05:00.011
Or maybe some people who would be grudging
about something else,

05:00.212 --> 05:02.473
whose attentions have been on some other
things.

05:02.674 --> 05:06.331
So forget about them, because you should
worry about your ascent.

05:06.532 --> 05:12.384
The negativity can also come from your
own understanding of things.

05:12.585 --> 05:18.353
My only effort was to see that you forget
the rest of the world

05:18.554 --> 05:23.142
and start ascending in collectivity,

05:23.343 --> 05:26.106
as well as in your own spiritual growth.

05:26.307 --> 05:30.782
These are so simultaneous that I cannot
differentiate between the two.

05:30.983 --> 05:35.127
Like the sun when it rises the sunshine
comes. It’s like that.

05:35.328 --> 05:38.287
So, one has to be very careful about this
point,

05:38.488 --> 05:43.084
that when you go from here, anybody who
starts talking

05:43.285 --> 05:48.250
in the anti-way, just put your hands
on your ears

05:48.451 --> 05:53.325
and say that, “This is not… We don’t want
to hear. Please don’t make us pull down”.

05:53.526 --> 05:59.161
Because they’ll pull you down and some who
are half-baked Sahaja Yogis will fall down.

05:59.362 --> 06:01.663
I hope all those who have come will stick

06:01.864 --> 06:04.393
to what they have achieved, what they
have felt,

06:04.594 --> 06:08.496
what they have understood and go further
with it.

06:08.697 --> 06:16.096
The wholesomeness, the wholesomeness
of the experience is to be envisaged,

06:16.297 --> 06:20.206
to be felt when you are gone from here.

06:20.407 --> 06:25.295
Just to think of it, the memory of that,
the Mahakali Shakti of that

06:25.496 --> 06:29.790
will give you all the beautiful
experiences,

06:29.990 --> 06:33.386
the shiver, which we call the shiver
of the experiences

06:33.587 --> 06:38.469
and you will enjoy the thrills that you
had in India,

06:38.670 --> 06:40.980
again back when you are in that country.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.811
And those thrills will fill the atmosphere.

06:44.012 --> 06:46.478
The atmosphere changes tremendously.

06:46.679 --> 06:49.187
When the Sahaja Yogis increase in sizes,

06:49.388 --> 06:53.130
the atmosphere changes and the climate
changes.

06:53.331 --> 06:56.305
Not only that, but human beings also start
changing.

06:56.506 --> 07:00.619
So it is necessary for us to have more and
more people coming to it.

07:00.820 --> 07:03.558
So now, first your own negativity is to be
seen.

07:03.759 --> 07:06.770
Then, you must see it among Sahaja Yogis,
we are one.

07:06.971 --> 07:08.861
Never criticize another Sahaja Yogi.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.669
Never talk to other Sahaja Yogi harshly.

07:11.870 --> 07:14.580
We are very kind to other people, because
we know that

07:14.781 --> 07:20.417
if we talk like this to another person that
person will not accept it and he will react.

07:20.618 --> 07:23.611
But with Sahaja Yoga many people try,
I have seen, to talk to each other

07:23.811 --> 07:27.377
in a very rough manner and sometimes

07:27.578 --> 07:31.361
in the organization also they try
to aggress.

07:31.562 --> 07:36.307
Like some arrangement is there so they’ll
say, “Why not this?”

07:36.508 --> 07:40.895
Try to give up most of the things that you
want to say.

07:41.096 --> 07:46.313
Is very simple, like that. That, now
supposing say to have this colour.

07:46.514 --> 07:49.284
Just keep quiet, see what happens.

07:49.485 --> 07:51.865
Because you think you can give a suggestion
you just

07:52.066 --> 07:54.019
give a suggestion, because you must say
something.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.739
Not necessary. Not necessary.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.976
Because you have seen in Japan, only one
person speaks.

08:00.177 --> 08:04.095
You see, if there is necessary to say
something, then you should say.

08:04.296 --> 08:08.216
Otherwise, unnecessarily, just to create
a new idea,

08:08.417 --> 08:12.999
a new theme, a new stuff, is not proper.

08:14.459 --> 08:18.653
Now, the main thing about Sahaja Yoga
is this,

08:18.853 --> 08:21.988
that it does not belong to any country.

08:22.189 --> 08:26.367
It belongs to the country that is God’s
kingdom.

08:26.568 --> 08:29.333
So it’s a very different thing into which
you have landed.

08:29.534 --> 08:32.716
Once you realize this, once you accept
this situation

08:32.917 --> 08:36.449
that you have now entered into the kingdom
of God,

08:36.650 --> 08:38.760
your sense of security will be built up,

08:38.961 --> 08:43.648
your style will [be] built up, your
behaviour will improve,

08:43.848 --> 08:46.183
your attitude towards yourself will improve

08:46.384 --> 08:52.554
and you will really feel you have jumped
into the sea, the ocean of joy.

08:52.755 --> 08:56.401
Just assume the power. Assumption is very
difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

08:56.602 --> 09:00.366
Reality people assume with difficulties.

09:00.567 --> 09:03.056
If it is unreal, if somebody can mesmerize,
you believe it.

09:03.257 --> 09:08.836
So just believe that you are in the heaven
now.

09:09.037 --> 09:14.306
This is the kingdom of God and this is
where you have to be and enjoy that.

09:14.507 --> 09:18.477
You will be amazed. Once it happens,
all your seeking will end,

09:18.678 --> 09:21.920
all your frustrations will end and now you
will know

09:22.121 --> 09:25.393
that you have reached that situation where
now you have to give.

09:25.594 --> 09:27.806
Now you have become the light and light
has to give.

09:28.007 --> 09:30.890
That’s the job of the light and you will
not be any more bothered

09:31.091 --> 09:33.764
about how to keep light going, because
once you start

09:33.965 --> 09:37.968
giving it that way it freely moves.

09:38.922 --> 09:42.562
The collectivity cannot come with mediocre
efforts.

09:42.763 --> 09:46.110
Like many people think that if you invite
people for tea

09:46.311 --> 09:48.797
or something like that, then the some
more people will come.

09:48.998 --> 09:50.870
Such people never stay.

09:51.071 --> 09:55.588
Or those people who like very sweet words
to be said to them and all that,

09:55.789 --> 09:58.353
they just come for a picnic sort
of a thing,

09:58.554 --> 10:04.964
have a very sweet sitting down, some sort
of a group, and then they disappear.

10:05.165 --> 10:08.197
So, we have to have people who are
of quality.

10:08.398 --> 10:10.668
To begin with we have to have people
of quality,

10:10.868 --> 10:13.878
to end with also we have to have people
with quality.

10:14.079 --> 10:17.549
The people who are peripheral are headaches
for Sahaja Yoga.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.824
They come, trouble us from the sides.

10:20.032 --> 10:24.523
Like you see these skirmishes we have
from the outside,

10:24.724 --> 10:28.610
that’s how they come and just hit some
people on the outside and went – go away.

10:28.810 --> 10:32.726
So the people who are on the periphery are
of no use to us.

10:32.930 --> 10:37.729
So try to have people of quality as far
as possible,  as many as you can.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.229
The popularity is not the point in Sahaja
Yoga.

10:40.430 --> 10:43.688
Is the quality, what you achieve and where
you reach.

10:43.889 --> 10:46.528
If the quality of the people is poor, just
give them up.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.414
Forget it, don’t argue with them,

10:48.615 --> 10:51.674
don’t try to persuade them, don’t try
to bring them.

10:51.875 --> 10:54.660
This is one of the understandings we should
have.

10:54.861 --> 10:57.472
We should not go on fighting for the whole
world.

10:57.673 --> 11:02.881
Where is the place in God’s heaven to fit
all these nonsensical people?

11:03.082 --> 11:05.424
There’s no room there. There’s no room.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.058
So better have it, because they don’t
deserve it.

11:08.259 --> 11:11.496
So don’t try to push such people into it.

11:11.697 --> 11:13.010
We are trying some experiments

11:13.210 --> 11:15.839
with some people who are very difficult
and useless.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.525
We are trying to push them here and there.

11:17.726 --> 11:20.984
If they do not work out, we’ll have to
throw them out. And you must accept it.

11:21.185 --> 11:23.394
There should be no compassion for such
people,

11:23.594 --> 11:27.049
but compassion for other Sahaja Yogis who
are suffering from them.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.393
That’s the best way to have compassion
is to understand

11:29.593 --> 11:32.706
these are saints and they are suffering
because of the negative people,

11:32.907 --> 11:37.040
so why push them into Sahaja Yoga and
trouble everyone?

11:37.241 --> 11:39.010
That’s not the way it should be.

11:39.211 --> 11:42.117
Now, so this is one of the things one
should understand

11:42.318 --> 11:45.340
when you are organizing, that have people
of quality.

11:45.541 --> 11:49.463
If you have ten people of quality will
create ten thousand tomorrow.

11:49.664 --> 11:51.689
But, if you have even one hopeless fellow,

11:51.890 --> 11:53.890
it will kill even the rest of the nine.

11:54.091 --> 11:57.869
So be careful that you don’t allow people

11:58.070 --> 12:00.407
who are not of quality to come to puja.

12:00.608 --> 12:02.713
Outsiders should not come to puja.

12:02.914 --> 12:05.456
Only the people who are of quality should
come,

12:05.657 --> 12:09.523
and those who have been now travelling,
we have been noting

12:09.724 --> 12:12.733
how they have been behaving, how their
behaviour has been,

12:12.934 --> 12:17.524
how they have been progressing. We know
all about them, every one of them.

12:17.725 --> 12:20.925
So, we’ll see them, how they are
progressing further

12:21.126 --> 12:23.557
when I visit your countries and I’ll see
for it.

12:23.758 --> 12:26.246
And then, I’ll be able to tell you

12:26.447 --> 12:31.078
that such and such person has not
progressed at all.

12:31.279 --> 12:35.909
So, this should be the attitude that we all
should individually progress

12:36.110 --> 12:40.365
and once we progress individually it shows
in collective enjoyment.

12:40.566 --> 12:45.784
A person who cannot enjoy collectivity is
not a Sahaja Yogi.

12:45.985 --> 12:49.037
Now Leader can be only one; there cannot
be three leaders.

12:49.238 --> 12:53.182
Now for all purposes I have appointed Danny

12:53.383 --> 12:58.433
as the Leader of United Nations,
the United ...

12:58.634 --> 13:02.994
Ah, that’s the word, that’s the word,
that’s the word!

13:03.195 --> 13:09.556
Ah, we should say United States, but then
we have to have United Nations later on.

13:17.518 --> 13:23.229
Because I find in Danny those qualities
which are required for a good Sahaja Yogi.

13:23.430 --> 13:27.004
He’s very congenial, he knows how to go
round people,

13:27.205 --> 13:31.087
he is very steadfast in his own ascent

13:31.288 --> 13:34.769
and he is a person who doesn’t shout
at people,

13:34.969 --> 13:38.130
who doesn’t get angry with people too much,

13:38.331 --> 13:42.239
and I haven’t seen him getting angry with
anyone whatsoever, so far.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.055
I have been with him for so many days.

13:44.256 --> 13:48.240
And, he manages people very well and he
knows how to control them.

13:48.440 --> 13:51.286
But, he is extremely strong as far as
Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

13:51.487 --> 13:53.936
Extremely strong and he understands it.

13:54.137 --> 13:58.362
So, all these qualities can help you people
very much to understand

13:58.563 --> 14:00.732
how a leader should be. Moreover, he is
selfless.

14:00.933 --> 14:03.565
He has no selfish aims for anything
whatsoever,

14:03.766 --> 14:06.293
for his name, for his position, for
anything I have seen.

14:06.494 --> 14:09.921
He doesn’t mind anybody becoming a leader,
he doesn’t mind anything whatsoever.

14:10.122 --> 14:14.143
That sort of a thing should be that anybody
becomes a leader is just a joke.

14:14.344 --> 14:17.261
Otherwise, I have seen people, you make them
the trustees they just ride on the horse.

14:17.462 --> 14:19.752
You make them something, leader, they’ll
ride on the horse.

14:19.953 --> 14:23.544
All sorts of things happen. That should not
happen anymore,

14:23.745 --> 14:26.171
and the leaders must see to the point

14:26.372 --> 14:30.163
that they have to become really great
evolved avadhutas.

14:30.364 --> 14:31.898
Otherwise they cannot impress people.

14:32.099 --> 14:37.807
Avadhutas are the people who are
extremely compassionate, extremely kind.

14:38.008 --> 14:41.566
And for you I would say you should follow
the example of Tukarama,

14:41.767 --> 14:45.077
because he was such a kind and a sweet
person,

14:45.278 --> 14:51.610
but he said things which were very, very
deep and very straightforward.

14:51.811 --> 14:54.784
So the forthright behaviour need not be

14:54.984 --> 14:57.283
so sharp as to cut everybody through.

14:57.484 --> 15:00.143
Forthright could be such that it guides
the person

15:00.344 --> 15:03.780
in the proper way and the plying
of a person

15:03.981 --> 15:09.129
in this ocean of maya becomes easier.
That is what is called the leadership.

15:09.329 --> 15:11.679
Now leadership should not be challenged.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.966
Some people have too much ideas from
outside, because they think

15:15.167 --> 15:19.792
they are something, you see, they know, they
are administrators or they are journalists

15:19.993 --> 15:24.052
or they have worked as some sort of
a politicians or this and that,

15:24.253 --> 15:28.146
and they try to control the leaders -
is a wrong thing.

15:28.347 --> 15:30.989
So now do not try to control the leaders.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.398
If there’s something wrong I’ll correct
them.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.537
This is very important, because again and
again I tell you

15:36.738 --> 15:40.948
that once you start challenging the leader
I get the pangs of it.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.147
So, please do not do it. If you do not want
to hurt me,

15:44.348 --> 15:47.428
do not challenge the leader as he is.

15:47.629 --> 15:51.131
Now, as you are going away,

15:51.332 --> 15:55.310
you are taking all the sweet memories from
here of the Indians.

15:55.510 --> 16:01.421
You have to take their last, I should say,
the glimpse

16:01.622 --> 16:08.870
and also give them a promise that you will
write to them, thanking them,

16:09.071 --> 16:13.511
keep contact, have friends, write letters
to them, they will write to you.

16:13.712 --> 16:17.428
Let us have contacts and know what’s
happening, where what is happening

16:17.629 --> 16:23.432
and thus we can have a nice circulation
and communication with each other

16:23.633 --> 16:27.387
and we can establish a better understanding

16:27.588 --> 16:31.381
of different countries through this method.

16:31.582 --> 16:37.878
Also, those who have come from other
countries, like say Australians have come,

16:38.079 --> 16:41.128
should write to English or they can write
to French

16:41.329 --> 16:43.369
or the French could write to Australians.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.220
Like that there should be a big movement.

16:46.420 --> 16:47.921
The circulation has to be good.

16:48.122 --> 16:50.860
If the circulation is not good the body
gets sick,

16:51.061 --> 16:56.551
so the circulation has to be good and all
of you have to do that circulation

16:56.752 --> 17:02.510
in a way that is good, compassionate and
in a Sahaj manner.

17:02.711 --> 17:08.027
My own work does not finish.

17:08.228 --> 17:13.099
I am moving on now, as you know,
to another areas.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.229
Then I’ll be going to Calcutta. For
the first time we’ll be having

17:16.430 --> 17:18.479
programme in Calcutta in this way.

17:18.679 --> 17:24.778
And then I am going to Australia and again
back, New Zealand

17:24.979 --> 17:29.369
and back to India and then again back
to London and I go on moving.

17:29.570 --> 17:33.783
You see mine is such a circuitous,
complicated roundabout ways.

17:33.984 --> 17:39.370
The sun has to do only one way. I’m going
this way, that way.

17:39.652 --> 17:42.865
All sorts of movements are there, nothing
regular.

17:43.066 --> 17:48.921
Absolutely it is regularly irregular. It is
like that.

17:49.122 --> 17:52.885
And it’s, still it’s working out.

17:53.088 --> 17:56.767
It works out with some sort of a rhythm
in it, I think.

17:56.968 --> 18:01.240
It pulsates and I feel quite happy with
that rhythmic movement.

18:01.441 --> 18:07.259
So, I have to pray that you look after
your health,

18:07.460 --> 18:10.579
look after your spiritual wealth

18:10.779 --> 18:16.134
and look after your Sahaja Yoga family
in your own countries.

18:16.335 --> 18:20.195
So may God bless you all.

18:21.767 --> 18:29.075
[Sentence in Marathi]

18:29.276 --> 18:34.059
I’m thanking them for looking after you
very much.

18:43.505 --> 18:47.311
They have, I mean, gone all the way out
in the villages

18:47.512 --> 18:53.185
and in very far-fetched places, and
whatever I asked them for

18:53.394 --> 18:59.138
they arranged the programmes in the actual
jungles and along the riversides,

18:59.339 --> 19:02.921
and all kinds of things they have done,
just to make you

19:03.122 --> 19:07.125
feel happy and away from the madding crowd.

19:07.326 --> 19:11.264
All this has worked out, only because
of their cooperation,

19:11.465 --> 19:14.569
without any reward, without anything.

19:14.770 --> 19:18.480
They have to take leave, giving up their
jobs and coming down.

19:18.681 --> 19:22.244
Everything they have done so well that
we can see

19:22.445 --> 19:25.818
that how in a place like Brahmapuri which
is such a far-fetched place,

19:26.019 --> 19:29.576
or in a place like Sangli where we had
no rooms or anything,

19:29.777 --> 19:32.313
they arranged all these tents, and all
that overnight

19:32.514 --> 19:35.514
for you people to stay and to enjoy your
stay there.

19:35.715 --> 19:40.596
So, if there was some sort of a problem
you must understand

19:40.797 --> 19:44.160
that we don’t have tents easily available
in India.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.481
We have to make them. We haven’t got
all these facilities

19:47.681 --> 19:51.115
as you have for camping, because you are
so fond of camping there

19:51.316 --> 19:54.150
that if you go to a shop you can get
everything for camping.

19:54.351 --> 19:58.128
Here you have to make everything. You just
cannot get things for camping, because

19:58.329 --> 20:01.547
somehow Indians have no time for
camping at all,

20:01.748 --> 20:04.805
and they have no part time for taking
a holiday,

20:05.006 --> 20:07.109
and neither they go for a holiday,

20:07.310 --> 20:09.444
and I was the other day surprised.
Somebody told me

20:09.645 --> 20:13.726
that he took a taxi and went to south
of India for a trip.

20:13.927 --> 20:18.538
I was really surprised. How could he do it,
because normally this is seldom done,

20:18.739 --> 20:22.108
and is a good idea to go down like that,
meet other Sahaja Yogis

20:22.309 --> 20:25.191
and have a little travel. But they just
don’t move.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.217
They’re like Ganeshas. Once set in one
place,

20:27.418 --> 20:32.875
they are set till they are put in the sea.

20:33.772 --> 20:36.855
So, it was very remarkable how so many
people have come

20:37.056 --> 20:40.334
from Delhi, all the way, and I thank them
for coming down

20:40.535 --> 20:45.364
and making this occasion so auspicious
and so beautiful.

20:52.073 --> 20:55.042
Specially, I have to thank Madras Sahaja
Yogis

20:55.243 --> 20:58.044
who have come all the way from Madras,
it’s so far away,

20:58.245 --> 21:02.519
to come here and to join us.

21:07.453 --> 21:10.915
Of course, the Maharashtra Sahaja Yogis are
to be thanked again and again

21:11.116 --> 21:14.459
for looking after us so well.

21:24.247 --> 21:28.206
I hope one day we’ll be able to invite them
to your different countries

21:28.436 --> 21:31.840
and can have some seminars like this.
One day, might be.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.395
Such a day might come such a time when
we will be able to do it,

21:34.596 --> 21:39.407
when we’ll have our own ship and people
can travel on the ship.

21:41.578 --> 21:46.873
Yogi: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

21:47.074 --> 21:52.201
Shri Mataji: And, I have such ideas.
You see, I’m too enthusiastic.

21:52.907 --> 21:54.896
I have tremendous ideas. If I tell you,

21:55.097 --> 21:59.080
you’ll be all jumping in the air, so I
don’t want to tell you about that.

21:59.281 --> 22:02.200
But it materializes. Somehow or other,
my ideas materialize,

22:02.401 --> 22:07.741
and we should have such a seminar that we
can celebrate it on a ship,

22:07.942 --> 22:10.999
where the ship moves throughout the world,
and we meet

22:11.200 --> 22:14.503
every corner and the shores of the world.
That would be a nice idea.

22:14.704 --> 22:17.743
For a month, if you travel, you can do it,
the whole world, I think.

22:17.944 --> 22:21.049
It’s not so difficult if you have a good,
nice ship,

22:21.250 --> 22:25.345
given us to us by IMO.

22:32.981 --> 22:35.595
So, this is hoping for the best.

22:35.796 --> 22:38.994
Now as it is, people are very helpful
in this country.

22:39.195 --> 22:40.833
The government is very helpful.

22:41.034 --> 22:42.931
We have seen the central government was
very helpful.

22:43.132 --> 22:45.882
The Customs were very helpful. All this
has happened

22:46.083 --> 22:48.537
because one person gets realization
in the Customs,

22:48.738 --> 22:51.573
he talks to another person, he gets all
the Custom people to do it.

22:51.774 --> 22:54.474
Then another person, a policeman, talks
to another policeman,

22:54.675 --> 22:56.036
all the policemen are there.

22:56.237 --> 22:58.632
But you see, the rapport in this country
is much more

22:58.833 --> 23:02.208
than it is otherwise because the climate
of this country is such

23:02.409 --> 23:05.813
that we are open, our houses are open,
we have an open home.

23:06.039 --> 23:10.321
We live in an open way. In a village
everybody knows everyone.

23:10.522 --> 23:14.912
Say, in a city, now, in Nagpur if you tell
my father’s name everybody knows him.

23:15.113 --> 23:17.779
I mean, everybody knows me, everybody
knows my father,

23:17.980 --> 23:20.651
and I know them, so it’s like a big
rapport,

23:20.851 --> 23:23.867
and that’s an advantage we have which
we can create there

23:24.068 --> 23:28.633
with the sunshine of our love. So, even
those who are not Sahaja Yogis,

23:28.834 --> 23:31.687
try to be kind to them, try to be nice
to them.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.071
Don’t show that you are fanatics
or anything,

23:34.271 --> 23:36.371
but try to be sweet and nice. Try.

23:36.572 --> 23:39.547
If they can come, well and good, but do not
insist, do not force them.

23:39.748 --> 23:42.688
That’s the worst thing. Never force such
people to come in

23:42.889 --> 23:46.008
because such people, if they come, they
are very great troublesome people.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.931
They are of no gain to us,

23:48.131 --> 23:50.577
so just do not force anybody to come.

23:50.778 --> 23:55.810
They are your relations, brothers, sisters,
husband, wife, just forget them.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.910
If they want to come, let them come.
Otherwise, just forget them.

23:59.111 --> 24:03.577
Don’t bother your heads about them.
Now, regarding next tour,

24:03.778 --> 24:06.345
I don’t know how we’ll do, manage it
next year,

24:06.548 --> 24:08.692
but I’ll let you know about it in time

24:08.892 --> 24:11.733
so that we can arrange it in a better way
than this time.

24:11.941 --> 24:15.246
Maybe we might have again two tours,
I don’t know,

24:15.446 --> 24:18.002
or maybe fifteen days’ tours, or something
like that,

24:18.203 --> 24:24.818
so that we do two sides of tour in fifteen
days, something like that.

24:25.019 --> 24:28.336
So, we’ll try to evolve new ideas as you
have seen

24:28.537 --> 24:32.728
that realisation giving is becoming simpler
and simpler, and maybe

24:32.929 --> 24:35.447
that just attending the programme, people
might get realised.

24:35.658 --> 24:39.910
It may happen like that, one day in India.

24:46.768 --> 24:49.743
I would like to have sensible, proper,

24:49.944 --> 24:52.988
constructive ideas from you for your
country.

24:53.189 --> 24:55.964
That’s a very good idea, but do not
condemn somebody else

24:56.165 --> 24:58.263
and say that that fellow is like this and
that.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.759
That I don’t like at all because I know
who is who.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.937
So, just tell me if you have any
constructive ideas about this,

25:05.138 --> 25:07.420
about propagating, going to some new
countries.

25:07.621 --> 25:11.043
Like, Gregoire wanted to start something
in Greece,

25:11.243 --> 25:14.115
and there are some people who want to do it
in Greece also.

25:14.316 --> 25:17.186
So, we have to see how we can work it out
in Greece

25:17.387 --> 25:19.776
and we have to find out people who will
work it out

25:19.977 --> 25:22.740
in other places, wherever you think you
can do it.

25:22.940 --> 25:27.255
Like Tunisia, some people said it would
be a good idea to enter into.

25:27.456 --> 25:30.802
But you just work it out and let me know

25:31.003 --> 25:34.021
whatever countries you think we can do
this.

25:34.222 --> 25:37.399
Maybe Brazil, maybe another place,
one could go.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.713
But now I think, before I go there, some
of you should go,

25:40.914 --> 25:45.456
work it out, establish a centre, have
a proper centre running,

25:45.673 --> 25:48.983
and then I should go. It’s better.
Otherwise it is quite wasted.

25:49.184 --> 25:51.598
That’s how we are going to propagate
in the west.

25:51.807 --> 25:56.424
In the same way in India, also we have
to do the same.

25:56.625 --> 26:02.112
I used to propagate it in such a manner
that we ourselves travel a lot.

26:02.313 --> 26:05.902
Say we are living in a place like Delhi,
we can go along,

26:06.103 --> 26:08.896
meet people of different organizations,
talk to them

26:09.097 --> 26:13.013
and organize that we’ll come and talk.
It’s not necessary for me to go there.

26:13.214 --> 26:17.097
You can all talk and give lectures, in
different organisations,

26:17.298 --> 26:23.143
in different institutions and in different
municipalities and all that.

26:23.344 --> 26:25.805
In India it is much easier to organise
these lectures.

26:26.005 --> 26:28.243
Indians are very fond of listening
to lectures.

26:28.444 --> 26:31.892
So that would be a good idea. But for
westerners also,

26:32.093 --> 26:35.570
like in universities you can handle
professors and talk to them.

26:35.771 --> 26:38.851
On your own you can think of so many things
that you can do.

26:39.052 --> 26:43.348
And I’m sure one day will come that all
these efforts will work out.

26:43.549 --> 26:46.311
As I told you about Buddha’s disciples
used to do.

26:46.512 --> 26:49.125
And I need not go to all these various
places.

26:49.326 --> 26:53.317
You can manage it and seeing you only,
people will get to Sahaja Yoga

26:53.542 --> 26:57.244
much faster, because they’ll think, the One
who has given them this,

26:57.445 --> 27:00.951
if they are so great, then that the Person
who has given must be greater

27:01.174 --> 27:06.781
and I need not see them, because sometimes
they get disappointed to see me also.

27:07.220 --> 27:16.702
They think that a person who was talking to
us was very brilliant and this and that,

27:16.902 --> 27:22.985
and in my own swabhava of Mahamaya

27:23.186 --> 27:26.651
I try to fumble and sometimes make
mistakes,

27:26.852 --> 27:32.414
and try to become a simple housewife.

27:32.615 --> 27:37.951
And then people don’t understand that this
little housewife,

27:38.152 --> 27:42.104
a government servant’s wife, you see,
that’s another gone case,

27:42.313 --> 27:49.099
and then an Indian Christian and all that
thing, then she’s must be hopeless.

27:49.646 --> 27:53.945
So all these things, you see, make up
for the mind

27:54.146 --> 27:59.533
and that’s how the, one can go into
the final decision

27:59.734 --> 28:04.110
of the last judgment. You see, Mahamaya
is the only way

28:04.311 --> 28:06.625
one can judge people. There’s no other
way out.

28:06.826 --> 28:13.988
Those who can see through the Maya, only
such people will be redeemed.

28:14.189 --> 28:18.308
Those who cannot see through the Maya
cannot be redeemed.

28:18.509 --> 28:22.213
So Maya is important.

28:31.033 --> 28:35.365
Now the last, but not the least,

28:35.573 --> 28:39.664
remember that your Mother loves you
very much.

28:54.471 --> 28:57.388
Thank you very much.
