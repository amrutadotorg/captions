00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.238
On this occasion when you are all leaving
me,

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.568
it’s rather hard to listen to these
qualities

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.352
described in your beautiful song.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:32.112
My words are so loaded with a feeling
of extreme sadness,

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:45.484
plus the exuberance of new ventures,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:48.656
some ideas that I have to do much more

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:53.536
to establish whatever you are describing
me.

00:00:54.235 --> 00:01:00.232
So many rakshasa are to be killed as you
have described me.

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:05.815
All the disparities are to be removed
from this world.

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:08.727
All the ignorance, the darkness,
the chimera

00:01:08.928 --> 00:01:12.893
has to be removed, as you have described
me.

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:17.772
It is very easy to destroy this world

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:26.959
and it was easier to destroy the demons
and the devils,

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:30.669
but today the time is so precarious

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.069
that all these have entered into
the brains,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.164
the Sahasrara of many seekers.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:46.848
So, it’s a very delicate task

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.396
to remove those horrible influences

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:59.312
to save the seekers from the clutches
of these devils.

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:04.599
You have been very kind to understand

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.037
that it is a very delicate thing and we
cannot do it

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:17.186
with harshness, with bluntness, with
straightforward statements.

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:23.352
We have to take them round because they
are hard rocks

00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:28.936
and make them understand through
compassion,

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:33.919
love and complete concern.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.582
Discretion is the only way we can manage

00:02:37.783 --> 00:02:44.745
and one has to use all kinds of methods
of discretion to save these people.

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:48.393
Once a maximum number is saved,

00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:52.006
the rakshasas can be destroyed.

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:56.784
As it is they are so much exposed now,
they are getting destroyed

00:02:56.985 --> 00:02:59.254
by themselves, by their own behaviour.

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:04.047
That’s the best about the falsehood, that
it shows itself.

00:03:04.248 --> 00:03:07.955
The effects are shown.

00:03:09.185 --> 00:03:14.906
In the process we also find

00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:21.897
that the effects of these devils are still
in our behaviour sometimes lingering.

00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:26.227
So all the Sahaja Yogis who have been
to other false gurus should be careful

00:03:26.428 --> 00:03:31.124
so that they should not be any more
dominated when they are ascending.

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:34.356
Also there are other effects of our past,

00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:38.519
our aggressiveness, our incompatibility,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.047
our anti-collective activities.

00:03:43.263 --> 00:03:45.947
All this comes from the grossness
of personality.

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:49.380
As soon as your grossness becomes subtler
and subtler

00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:58.036
you’ll merge, dissolve into the collective
understanding, very easily.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:11.527
Now, the things that I have to do sometimes
looks like mountainous

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:17.736
and I seek your help in every way.

00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:22.341
I cannot do it alone, so I seek your help

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:26.563
and I ask for your guidance in many ways,

00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:31.064
because human beings are not easy
to understand.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:35.242
You have to ask human beings what they
are up to.

00:04:35.443 --> 00:04:39.271
Now, the first task is ahead of you is
to save yourself

00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:43.616
from negativity from within, from within.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:46.234
You might find one or two murmuring souls
here and there

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:49.286
talking nonsense about the programme
we had,

00:04:49.487 --> 00:04:51.872
the tour we had, the way we went round,

00:04:52.073 --> 00:04:56.328
about nonsensical things, which has no
meaning to the spiritual life.

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.011
Or maybe some people who would be grudging
about something else,

00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.473
whose attentions have been on some other
things.

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:06.331
So forget about them, because you should
worry about your ascent.

00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:12.384
The negativity can also come from your
own understanding of things.

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:18.353
My only effort was to see that you forget
the rest of the world

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:23.142
and start ascending in collectivity,

00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:26.106
as well as in your own spiritual growth.

00:05:26.307 --> 00:05:30.782
These are so simultaneous that I cannot
differentiate between the two.

00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:35.127
Like the sun when it rises the sunshine
comes. It’s like that.

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:38.287
So, one has to be very careful about this
point,

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:43.084
that when you go from here, anybody who
starts talking

00:05:43.285 --> 00:05:48.250
in the anti-way, just put your hands
on your ears

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:53.325
and say that, “This is not… We don’t want
to hear. Please don’t make us pull down”.

00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:59.161
Because they’ll pull you down and some who
are half-baked Sahaja Yogis will fall down.

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:01.663
I hope all those who have come will stick

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:04.393
to what they have achieved, what they
have felt,

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:08.496
what they have understood and go further
with it.

00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:16.096
The wholesomeness, the wholesomeness
of the experience is to be envisaged,

00:06:16.297 --> 00:06:20.206
to be felt when you are gone from here.

00:06:20.407 --> 00:06:25.295
Just to think of it, the memory of that,
the Mahakali Shakti of that

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:29.790
will give you all the beautiful
experiences,

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.386
the shiver, which we call the shiver
of the experiences

00:06:33.587 --> 00:06:38.469
and you will enjoy the thrills that you
had in India,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.980
again back when you are in that country.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.811
And those thrills will fill the atmosphere.

00:06:44.012 --> 00:06:46.478
The atmosphere changes tremendously.

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:49.187
When the Sahaja Yogis increase in sizes,

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:53.130
the atmosphere changes and the climate
changes.

00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.305
Not only that, but human beings also start
changing.

00:06:56.506 --> 00:07:00.619
So it is necessary for us to have more and
more people coming to it.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.558
So now, first your own negativity is to be
seen.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.770
Then, you must see it among Sahaja Yogis,
we are one.

00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:08.861
Never criticize another Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:11.669
Never talk to other Sahaja Yogi harshly.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.580
We are very kind to other people, because
we know that

00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:20.417
if we talk like this to another person that
person will not accept it and he will react.

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:23.611
But with Sahaja Yoga many people try,
I have seen, to talk to each other

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.377
in a very rough manner and sometimes

00:07:27.578 --> 00:07:31.361
in the organization also they try
to aggress.

00:07:31.562 --> 00:07:36.307
Like some arrangement is there so they’ll
say, “Why not this?”

00:07:36.508 --> 00:07:40.895
Try to give up most of the things that you
want to say.

00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:46.313
Is very simple, like that. That, now
supposing say to have this colour.

00:07:46.514 --> 00:07:49.284
Just keep quiet, see what happens.

00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:51.865
Because you think you can give a suggestion
you just

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:54.019
give a suggestion, because you must say
something.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.739
Not necessary. Not necessary.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.976
Because you have seen in Japan, only one
person speaks.

00:08:00.177 --> 00:08:04.095
You see, if there is necessary to say
something, then you should say.

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:08.216
Otherwise, unnecessarily, just to create
a new idea,

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:12.999
a new theme, a new stuff, is not proper.

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:18.653
Now, the main thing about Sahaja Yoga
is this,

00:08:18.853 --> 00:08:21.988
that it does not belong to any country.

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:26.367
It belongs to the country that is God’s
kingdom.

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:29.333
So it’s a very different thing into which
you have landed.

00:08:29.534 --> 00:08:32.716
Once you realize this, once you accept
this situation

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:36.449
that you have now entered into the kingdom
of God,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.760
your sense of security will be built up,

00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:43.648
your style will [be] built up, your
behaviour will improve,

00:08:43.848 --> 00:08:46.183
your attitude towards yourself will improve

00:08:46.384 --> 00:08:52.554
and you will really feel you have jumped
into the sea, the ocean of joy.

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:56.401
Just assume the power. Assumption is very
difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:56.602 --> 00:09:00.366
Reality people assume with difficulties.

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:03.056
If it is unreal, if somebody can mesmerize,
you believe it.

00:09:03.257 --> 00:09:08.836
So just believe that you are in the heaven
now.

00:09:09.037 --> 00:09:14.306
This is the kingdom of God and this is
where you have to be and enjoy that.

00:09:14.507 --> 00:09:18.477
You will be amazed. Once it happens,
all your seeking will end,

00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:21.920
all your frustrations will end and now you
will know

00:09:22.121 --> 00:09:25.393
that you have reached that situation where
now you have to give.

00:09:25.594 --> 00:09:27.806
Now you have become the light and light
has to give.

00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:30.890
That’s the job of the light and you will
not be any more bothered

00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:33.764
about how to keep light going, because
once you start

00:09:33.965 --> 00:09:37.968
giving it that way it freely moves.

00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:42.562
The collectivity cannot come with mediocre
efforts.

00:09:42.763 --> 00:09:46.110
Like many people think that if you invite
people for tea

00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:48.797
or something like that, then the some
more people will come.

00:09:48.998 --> 00:09:50.870
Such people never stay.

00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:55.588
Or those people who like very sweet words
to be said to them and all that,

00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:58.353
they just come for a picnic sort
of a thing,

00:09:58.554 --> 00:10:04.964
have a very sweet sitting down, some sort
of a group, and then they disappear.

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:08.197
So, we have to have people who are
of quality.

00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:10.668
To begin with we have to have people
of quality,

00:10:10.868 --> 00:10:13.878
to end with also we have to have people
with quality.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.549
The people who are peripheral are headaches
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.824
They come, trouble us from the sides.

00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:24.523
Like you see these skirmishes we have
from the outside,

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:28.610
that’s how they come and just hit some
people on the outside and went – go away.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.726
So the people who are on the periphery are
of no use to us.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.729
So try to have people of quality as far
as possible,  as many as you can.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.229
The popularity is not the point in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.688
Is the quality, what you achieve and where
you reach.

00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:46.528
If the quality of the people is poor, just
give them up.

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:48.414
Forget it, don’t argue with them,

00:10:48.615 --> 00:10:51.674
don’t try to persuade them, don’t try
to bring them.

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:54.660
This is one of the understandings we should
have.

00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:57.472
We should not go on fighting for the whole
world.

00:10:57.673 --> 00:11:02.881
Where is the place in God’s heaven to fit
all these nonsensical people?

00:11:03.082 --> 00:11:05.424
There’s no room there. There’s no room.

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:08.058
So better have it, because they don’t
deserve it.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:11.496
So don’t try to push such people into it.

00:11:11.697 --> 00:11:13.010
We are trying some experiments

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.839
with some people who are very difficult
and useless.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.525
We are trying to push them here and there.

00:11:17.726 --> 00:11:20.984
If they do not work out, we’ll have to
throw them out. And you must accept it.

00:11:21.185 --> 00:11:23.394
There should be no compassion for such
people,

00:11:23.594 --> 00:11:27.049
but compassion for other Sahaja Yogis who
are suffering from them.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.393
That’s the best way to have compassion
is to understand

00:11:29.593 --> 00:11:32.706
these are saints and they are suffering
because of the negative people,

00:11:32.907 --> 00:11:37.040
so why push them into Sahaja Yoga and
trouble everyone?

00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:39.010
That’s not the way it should be.

00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.117
Now, so this is one of the things one
should understand

00:11:42.318 --> 00:11:45.340
when you are organizing, that have people
of quality.

00:11:45.541 --> 00:11:49.463
If you have ten people of quality will
create ten thousand tomorrow.

00:11:49.664 --> 00:11:51.689
But, if you have even one hopeless fellow,

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.890
it will kill even the rest of the nine.

00:11:54.091 --> 00:11:57.869
So be careful that you don’t allow people

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.407
who are not of quality to come to puja.

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:02.713
Outsiders should not come to puja.

00:12:02.914 --> 00:12:05.456
Only the people who are of quality should
come,

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:09.523
and those who have been now travelling,
we have been noting

00:12:09.724 --> 00:12:12.733
how they have been behaving, how their
behaviour has been,

00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:17.524
how they have been progressing. We know
all about them, every one of them.

00:12:17.725 --> 00:12:20.925
So, we’ll see them, how they are
progressing further

00:12:21.126 --> 00:12:23.557
when I visit your countries and I’ll see
for it.

00:12:23.758 --> 00:12:26.246
And then, I’ll be able to tell you

00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:31.078
that such and such person has not
progressed at all.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:35.909
So, this should be the attitude that we all
should individually progress

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.365
and once we progress individually it shows
in collective enjoyment.

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:45.784
A person who cannot enjoy collectivity is
not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:45.985 --> 00:12:49.037
Now Leader can be only one; there cannot
be three leaders.

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:53.182
Now for all purposes I have appointed Danny

00:12:53.383 --> 00:12:58.433
as the Leader of United Nations,
the United ...

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:02.994
Ah, that’s the word, that’s the word,
that’s the word!

00:13:03.195 --> 00:13:09.556
Ah, we should say United States, but then
we have to have United Nations later on.

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:23.229
Because I find in Danny those qualities
which are required for a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.004
He’s very congenial, he knows how to go
round people,

00:13:27.205 --> 00:13:31.087
he is very steadfast in his own ascent

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:34.769
and he is a person who doesn’t shout
at people,

00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:38.130
who doesn’t get angry with people too much,

00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:42.239
and I haven’t seen him getting angry with
anyone whatsoever, so far.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.055
I have been with him for so many days.

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:48.240
And, he manages people very well and he
knows how to control them.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.286
But, he is extremely strong as far as
Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:13:51.487 --> 00:13:53.936
Extremely strong and he understands it.

00:13:54.137 --> 00:13:58.362
So, all these qualities can help you people
very much to understand

00:13:58.563 --> 00:14:00.732
how a leader should be. Moreover, he is
selfless.

00:14:00.933 --> 00:14:03.565
He has no selfish aims for anything
whatsoever,

00:14:03.766 --> 00:14:06.293
for his name, for his position, for
anything I have seen.

00:14:06.494 --> 00:14:09.921
He doesn’t mind anybody becoming a leader,
he doesn’t mind anything whatsoever.

00:14:10.122 --> 00:14:14.143
That sort of a thing should be that anybody
becomes a leader is just a joke.

00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:17.261
Otherwise, I have seen people, you make them
the trustees they just ride on the horse.

00:14:17.462 --> 00:14:19.752
You make them something, leader, they’ll
ride on the horse.

00:14:19.953 --> 00:14:23.544
All sorts of things happen. That should not
happen anymore,

00:14:23.745 --> 00:14:26.171
and the leaders must see to the point

00:14:26.372 --> 00:14:30.163
that they have to become really great
evolved avadhutas.

00:14:30.364 --> 00:14:31.898
Otherwise they cannot impress people.

00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:37.807
Avadhutas are the people who are
extremely compassionate, extremely kind.

00:14:38.008 --> 00:14:41.566
And for you I would say you should follow
the example of Tukarama,

00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:45.077
because he was such a kind and a sweet
person,

00:14:45.278 --> 00:14:51.610
but he said things which were very, very
deep and very straightforward.

00:14:51.811 --> 00:14:54.784
So the forthright behaviour need not be

00:14:54.984 --> 00:14:57.283
so sharp as to cut everybody through.

00:14:57.484 --> 00:15:00.143
Forthright could be such that it guides
the person

00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:03.780
in the proper way and the plying
of a person

00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:09.129
in this ocean of maya becomes easier.
That is what is called the leadership.

00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:11.679
Now leadership should not be challenged.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.966
Some people have too much ideas from
outside, because they think

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:19.792
they are something, you see, they know, they
are administrators or they are journalists

00:15:19.993 --> 00:15:24.052
or they have worked as some sort of
a politicians or this and that,

00:15:24.253 --> 00:15:28.146
and they try to control the leaders -
is a wrong thing.

00:15:28.347 --> 00:15:30.989
So now do not try to control the leaders.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.398
If there’s something wrong I’ll correct
them.

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:36.537
This is very important, because again and
again I tell you

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:40.948
that once you start challenging the leader
I get the pangs of it.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:44.147
So, please do not do it. If you do not want
to hurt me,

00:15:44.348 --> 00:15:47.428
do not challenge the leader as he is.

00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:51.131
Now, as you are going away,

00:15:51.332 --> 00:15:55.310
you are taking all the sweet memories from
here of the Indians.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:01.421
You have to take their last, I should say,
the glimpse

00:16:01.622 --> 00:16:08.870
and also give them a promise that you will
write to them, thanking them,

00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:13.511
keep contact, have friends, write letters
to them, they will write to you.

00:16:13.712 --> 00:16:17.428
Let us have contacts and know what’s
happening, where what is happening

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:23.432
and thus we can have a nice circulation
and communication with each other

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:27.387
and we can establish a better understanding

00:16:27.588 --> 00:16:31.381
of different countries through this method.

00:16:31.582 --> 00:16:37.878
Also, those who have come from other
countries, like say Australians have come,

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:41.128
should write to English or they can write
to French

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:43.369
or the French could write to Australians.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.220
Like that there should be a big movement.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.921
The circulation has to be good.

00:16:48.122 --> 00:16:50.860
If the circulation is not good the body
gets sick,

00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:56.551
so the circulation has to be good and all
of you have to do that circulation

00:16:56.752 --> 00:17:02.510
in a way that is good, compassionate and
in a Sahaj manner.

00:17:02.711 --> 00:17:08.027
My own work does not finish.

00:17:08.228 --> 00:17:13.099
I am moving on now, as you know,
to another areas.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.229
Then I’ll be going to Calcutta. For
the first time we’ll be having

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.479
programme in Calcutta in this way.

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:24.778
And then I am going to Australia and again
back, New Zealand

00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:29.369
and back to India and then again back
to London and I go on moving.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.783
You see mine is such a circuitous,
complicated roundabout ways.

00:17:33.984 --> 00:17:39.370
The sun has to do only one way. I’m going
this way, that way.

00:17:39.652 --> 00:17:42.865
All sorts of movements are there, nothing
regular.

00:17:43.066 --> 00:17:48.921
Absolutely it is regularly irregular. It is
like that.

00:17:49.122 --> 00:17:52.885
And it’s, still it’s working out.

00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:56.767
It works out with some sort of a rhythm
in it, I think.

00:17:56.968 --> 00:18:01.240
It pulsates and I feel quite happy with
that rhythmic movement.

00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:07.259
So, I have to pray that you look after
your health,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.579
look after your spiritual wealth

00:18:10.779 --> 00:18:16.134
and look after your Sahaja Yoga family
in your own countries.

00:18:16.335 --> 00:18:20.195
So may God bless you all.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:29.075
[Sentence in Marathi]

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:34.059
I’m thanking them for looking after you
very much.

00:18:43.505 --> 00:18:47.311
They have, I mean, gone all the way out
in the villages

00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:53.185
and in very far-fetched places, and
whatever I asked them for

00:18:53.394 --> 00:18:59.138
they arranged the programmes in the actual
jungles and along the riversides,

00:18:59.339 --> 00:19:02.921
and all kinds of things they have done,
just to make you

00:19:03.122 --> 00:19:07.125
feel happy and away from the madding crowd.

00:19:07.326 --> 00:19:11.264
All this has worked out, only because
of their cooperation,

00:19:11.465 --> 00:19:14.569
without any reward, without anything.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:18.480
They have to take leave, giving up their
jobs and coming down.

00:19:18.681 --> 00:19:22.244
Everything they have done so well that
we can see

00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:25.818
that how in a place like Brahmapuri which
is such a far-fetched place,

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:29.576
or in a place like Sangli where we had
no rooms or anything,

00:19:29.777 --> 00:19:32.313
they arranged all these tents, and all
that overnight

00:19:32.514 --> 00:19:35.514
for you people to stay and to enjoy your
stay there.

00:19:35.715 --> 00:19:40.596
So, if there was some sort of a problem
you must understand

00:19:40.797 --> 00:19:44.160
that we don’t have tents easily available
in India.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.481
We have to make them. We haven’t got
all these facilities

00:19:47.681 --> 00:19:51.115
as you have for camping, because you are
so fond of camping there

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:54.150
that if you go to a shop you can get
everything for camping.

00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:58.128
Here you have to make everything. You just
cannot get things for camping, because

00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:01.547
somehow Indians have no time for
camping at all,

00:20:01.748 --> 00:20:04.805
and they have no part time for taking
a holiday,

00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.109
and neither they go for a holiday,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.444
and I was the other day surprised.
Somebody told me

00:20:09.645 --> 00:20:13.726
that he took a taxi and went to south
of India for a trip.

00:20:13.927 --> 00:20:18.538
I was really surprised. How could he do it,
because normally this is seldom done,

00:20:18.739 --> 00:20:22.108
and is a good idea to go down like that,
meet other Sahaja Yogis

00:20:22.309 --> 00:20:25.191
and have a little travel. But they just
don’t move.

00:20:25.392 --> 00:20:27.217
They’re like Ganeshas. Once set in one
place,

00:20:27.418 --> 00:20:32.875
they are set till they are put in the sea.

00:20:33.772 --> 00:20:36.855
So, it was very remarkable how so many
people have come

00:20:37.056 --> 00:20:40.334
from Delhi, all the way, and I thank them
for coming down

00:20:40.535 --> 00:20:45.364
and making this occasion so auspicious
and so beautiful.

00:20:52.073 --> 00:20:55.042
Specially, I have to thank Madras Sahaja
Yogis

00:20:55.243 --> 00:20:58.044
who have come all the way from Madras,
it’s so far away,

00:20:58.245 --> 00:21:02.519
to come here and to join us.

00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:10.915
Of course, the Maharashtra Sahaja Yogis are
to be thanked again and again

00:21:11.116 --> 00:21:14.459
for looking after us so well.

00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:28.206
I hope one day we’ll be able to invite them
to your different countries

00:21:28.436 --> 00:21:31.840
and can have some seminars like this.
One day, might be.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.395
Such a day might come such a time when
we will be able to do it,

00:21:34.596 --> 00:21:39.407
when we’ll have our own ship and people
can travel on the ship.

00:21:41.578 --> 00:21:46.873
Yogi: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

00:21:47.074 --> 00:21:52.201
Shri Mataji: And, I have such ideas.
You see, I’m too enthusiastic.

00:21:52.907 --> 00:21:54.896
I have tremendous ideas. If I tell you,

00:21:55.097 --> 00:21:59.080
you’ll be all jumping in the air, so I
don’t want to tell you about that.

00:21:59.281 --> 00:22:02.200
But it materializes. Somehow or other,
my ideas materialize,

00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:07.741
and we should have such a seminar that we
can celebrate it on a ship,

00:22:07.942 --> 00:22:10.999
where the ship moves throughout the world,
and we meet

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.503
every corner and the shores of the world.
That would be a nice idea.

00:22:14.704 --> 00:22:17.743
For a month, if you travel, you can do it,
the whole world, I think.

00:22:17.944 --> 00:22:21.049
It’s not so difficult if you have a good,
nice ship,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.345
given us to us by IMO.

00:22:32.981 --> 00:22:35.595
So, this is hoping for the best.

00:22:35.796 --> 00:22:38.994
Now as it is, people are very helpful
in this country.

00:22:39.195 --> 00:22:40.833
The government is very helpful.

00:22:41.034 --> 00:22:42.931
We have seen the central government was
very helpful.

00:22:43.132 --> 00:22:45.882
The Customs were very helpful. All this
has happened

00:22:46.083 --> 00:22:48.537
because one person gets realization
in the Customs,

00:22:48.738 --> 00:22:51.573
he talks to another person, he gets all
the Custom people to do it.

00:22:51.774 --> 00:22:54.474
Then another person, a policeman, talks
to another policeman,

00:22:54.675 --> 00:22:56.036
all the policemen are there.

00:22:56.237 --> 00:22:58.632
But you see, the rapport in this country
is much more

00:22:58.833 --> 00:23:02.208
than it is otherwise because the climate
of this country is such

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:05.813
that we are open, our houses are open,
we have an open home.

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:10.321
We live in an open way. In a village
everybody knows everyone.

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:14.912
Say, in a city, now, in Nagpur if you tell
my father’s name everybody knows him.

00:23:15.113 --> 00:23:17.779
I mean, everybody knows me, everybody
knows my father,

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.651
and I know them, so it’s like a big
rapport,

00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:23.867
and that’s an advantage we have which
we can create there

00:23:24.068 --> 00:23:28.633
with the sunshine of our love. So, even
those who are not Sahaja Yogis,

00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:31.687
try to be kind to them, try to be nice
to them.

00:23:31.888 --> 00:23:34.071
Don’t show that you are fanatics
or anything,

00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:36.371
but try to be sweet and nice. Try.

00:23:36.572 --> 00:23:39.547
If they can come, well and good, but do not
insist, do not force them.

00:23:39.748 --> 00:23:42.688
That’s the worst thing. Never force such
people to come in

00:23:42.889 --> 00:23:46.008
because such people, if they come, they
are very great troublesome people.

00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.931
They are of no gain to us,

00:23:48.131 --> 00:23:50.577
so just do not force anybody to come.

00:23:50.778 --> 00:23:55.810
They are your relations, brothers, sisters,
husband, wife, just forget them.

00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:58.910
If they want to come, let them come.
Otherwise, just forget them.

00:23:59.111 --> 00:24:03.577
Don’t bother your heads about them.
Now, regarding next tour,

00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:06.345
I don’t know how we’ll do, manage it
next year,

00:24:06.548 --> 00:24:08.692
but I’ll let you know about it in time

00:24:08.892 --> 00:24:11.733
so that we can arrange it in a better way
than this time.

00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:15.246
Maybe we might have again two tours,
I don’t know,

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:18.002
or maybe fifteen days’ tours, or something
like that,

00:24:18.203 --> 00:24:24.818
so that we do two sides of tour in fifteen
days, something like that.

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:28.336
So, we’ll try to evolve new ideas as you
have seen

00:24:28.537 --> 00:24:32.728
that realisation giving is becoming simpler
and simpler, and maybe

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:35.447
that just attending the programme, people
might get realised.

00:24:35.658 --> 00:24:39.910
It may happen like that, one day in India.

00:24:46.768 --> 00:24:49.743
I would like to have sensible, proper,

00:24:49.944 --> 00:24:52.988
constructive ideas from you for your
country.

00:24:53.189 --> 00:24:55.964
That’s a very good idea, but do not
condemn somebody else

00:24:56.165 --> 00:24:58.263
and say that that fellow is like this and
that.

00:24:58.464 --> 00:25:00.759
That I don’t like at all because I know
who is who.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.937
So, just tell me if you have any
constructive ideas about this,

00:25:05.138 --> 00:25:07.420
about propagating, going to some new
countries.

00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:11.043
Like, Gregoire wanted to start something
in Greece,

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:14.115
and there are some people who want to do it
in Greece also.

00:25:14.316 --> 00:25:17.186
So, we have to see how we can work it out
in Greece

00:25:17.387 --> 00:25:19.776
and we have to find out people who will
work it out

00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:22.740
in other places, wherever you think you
can do it.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.255
Like Tunisia, some people said it would
be a good idea to enter into.

00:25:27.456 --> 00:25:30.802
But you just work it out and let me know

00:25:31.003 --> 00:25:34.021
whatever countries you think we can do
this.

00:25:34.222 --> 00:25:37.399
Maybe Brazil, maybe another place,
one could go.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.713
But now I think, before I go there, some
of you should go,

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:45.456
work it out, establish a centre, have
a proper centre running,

00:25:45.673 --> 00:25:48.983
and then I should go. It’s better.
Otherwise it is quite wasted.

00:25:49.184 --> 00:25:51.598
That’s how we are going to propagate
in the west.

00:25:51.807 --> 00:25:56.424
In the same way in India, also we have
to do the same.

00:25:56.625 --> 00:26:02.112
I used to propagate it in such a manner
that we ourselves travel a lot.

00:26:02.313 --> 00:26:05.902
Say we are living in a place like Delhi,
we can go along,

00:26:06.103 --> 00:26:08.896
meet people of different organizations,
talk to them

00:26:09.097 --> 00:26:13.013
and organize that we’ll come and talk.
It’s not necessary for me to go there.

00:26:13.214 --> 00:26:17.097
You can all talk and give lectures, in
different organisations,

00:26:17.298 --> 00:26:23.143
in different institutions and in different
municipalities and all that.

00:26:23.344 --> 00:26:25.805
In India it is much easier to organise
these lectures.

00:26:26.005 --> 00:26:28.243
Indians are very fond of listening
to lectures.

00:26:28.444 --> 00:26:31.892
So that would be a good idea. But for
westerners also,

00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:35.570
like in universities you can handle
professors and talk to them.

00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:38.851
On your own you can think of so many things
that you can do.

00:26:39.052 --> 00:26:43.348
And I’m sure one day will come that all
these efforts will work out.

00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:46.311
As I told you about Buddha’s disciples
used to do.

00:26:46.512 --> 00:26:49.125
And I need not go to all these various
places.

00:26:49.326 --> 00:26:53.317
You can manage it and seeing you only,
people will get to Sahaja Yoga

00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:57.244
much faster, because they’ll think, the One
who has given them this,

00:26:57.445 --> 00:27:00.951
if they are so great, then that the Person
who has given must be greater

00:27:01.174 --> 00:27:06.781
and I need not see them, because sometimes
they get disappointed to see me also.

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:16.702
They think that a person who was talking to
us was very brilliant and this and that,

00:27:16.902 --> 00:27:22.985
and in my own swabhava of Mahamaya

00:27:23.186 --> 00:27:26.651
I try to fumble and sometimes make
mistakes,

00:27:26.852 --> 00:27:32.414
and try to become a simple housewife.

00:27:32.615 --> 00:27:37.951
And then people don’t understand that this
little housewife,

00:27:38.152 --> 00:27:42.104
a government servant’s wife, you see,
that’s another gone case,

00:27:42.313 --> 00:27:49.099
and then an Indian Christian and all that
thing, then she’s must be hopeless.

00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:53.945
So all these things, you see, make up
for the mind

00:27:54.146 --> 00:27:59.533
and that’s how the, one can go into
the final decision

00:27:59.734 --> 00:28:04.110
of the last judgment. You see, Mahamaya
is the only way

00:28:04.311 --> 00:28:06.625
one can judge people. There’s no other
way out.

00:28:06.826 --> 00:28:13.988
Those who can see through the Maya, only
such people will be redeemed.

00:28:14.189 --> 00:28:18.308
Those who cannot see through the Maya
cannot be redeemed.

00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:22.213
So Maya is important.

00:28:31.033 --> 00:28:35.365
Now the last, but not the least,

00:28:35.573 --> 00:28:39.664
remember that your Mother loves you
very much.

00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:57.388
Thank you very much.
