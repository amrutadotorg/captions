00:04.810 --> 00:05.170
October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

00:05.170 --> 00:12.170
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

00:17.960 --> 00:24.960
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive. [translation follows - yes]

00:40.640 --> 00:47.640
It is a .. it is a new dimension I think,
I feel, we are entering into. Because now

00:56.620 --> 01:03.620
we are really getting people who are seriously
interested in their realization and are very

01:10.880 --> 01:17.880
respectful. And that aggressiveness is much
less. You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

01:23.950 --> 01:30.950
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

01:39.139 --> 01:46.139
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely. Now this Sahaj manner

01:53.139 --> 02:00.139
should be understood. In a Sahaj manner, when
they come to you, you must know they are absolutely

02:03.359 --> 02:10.359
new to Sahaja Yoga.

02:11.610 --> 02:18.610
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me. You should not tell them anything

02:22.750 --> 02:29.750
about Me; but you have to tell them about
Sahaja Yoga and about yourself. Like you can

02:41.379 --> 02:48.379
say, “I had the same problem as you have.”
Or you can say that “See, it took me more

02:53.840 --> 03:00.840
time then it
took you.” It’s a little lie, but doesn’t
matter. [Shri Mataji laughs.] You see, because

03:15.140 --> 03:22.140
first of all, you must understand human beings.
If you tell them directly “You are bad”

03:25.450 --> 03:32.450
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then
they will run away, though it is true.

03:37.099 --> 03:44.099
A lady from France came to see Me. She said
that “They told me I’m evil.” So I said,

03:53.620 --> 04:00.620
“No, no you are not. Who told you that?”
And gradually she improved. So you have to

04:06.260 --> 04:13.260
tell them that “You are the Spirit” and
whatever is hanging on to them will be dropped

04:16.640 --> 04:23.640
out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.
So if that happens they feel happy and they

04:37.620 --> 04:44.620
get their benevolence. It is how beautifully
you handle another person.

04:52.199 --> 04:59.199
Now there maybe people who want to argue.
With them you should say, “You know, you

05:03.479 --> 05:10.479
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond
human awareness.” And you better tell them

05:14.810 --> 05:21.810
that it is … “You better take your Realization,
then we will talk about it. Not before your

05:26.840 --> 05:33.410
Realization.” So then, if they are not getting
any Realization, you don’t tell them that

05:33.410 --> 05:40.410
“There is a bhoot sitting in your left Nabhi
or right Nabhi.” This is our language – Sahaja

05:47.449 --> 05:54.449
Yogi’s language, not their language. Ya,
so you have to be very careful to handle them

05:57.930 --> 06:04.930
very carefully.
Now there could be a problem between, say,

06:07.289 --> 06:14.289
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter
or maybe husband and wife. So …

06:15.410 --> 06:22.410
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right? All of you should pay attention

06:31.379 --> 06:38.379
to Me. All right? No, no it’s all right.
Let her be there. It’s all right, but she

06:41.050 --> 06:47.500
should pay attention this time, all right?
Sit down.)

06:47.500 --> 06:54.500
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

06:55.979 --> 07:02.979
joy will start giving you strength.”
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -
see you’re honest, your purpose and would

07:27.560 --> 07:34.560
try to appreciate you. Gradually it works
out. But if it does not, then we’ll see

07:39.080 --> 07:46.080
about it. Now when you handle them with love
and care, you can establish them. But if they

08:02.009 --> 08:09.009
start misbehaving you also should not lose
temper at all. You should be very forgiving.

08:17.639 --> 08:24.639
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders. Of course, you might

08:31.150 --> 08:38.150
not find them perfect, maybe. Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.
But you need some bossing sometimes. And leaders

09:00.390 --> 09:07.390
must know how to also correct people, because
you need correction. I met a lady, I was telling

09:14.269 --> 09:21.269
you, we had told them, that you need not have
a guru. So, she said “No, no we must have

09:25.740 --> 09:32.740
somebody to guide us. And that guru will guide
us and also will support us, so we would like

09:40.010 --> 09:47.010
to follow him. In spite of the fact he is
a very bossy fellow and he always gets annoyed

09:47.290 --> 09:54.290
with us and he takes money from us. And it’s
not a guru, if he’s not, if he is very soft,

10:03.560 --> 10:10.560
means he should not be kind.”

10:15.200 --> 10:22.200
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate
them for their spiritual ascent. They are

10:32.810 --> 10:39.810
better people, because they want their ascent
in any case. And they accept corrections,

10:47.490 --> 10:54.490
because they want their ascent. That’s the
first thing. So even if the leader bosses,

10:56.550 --> 11:03.550
they like it very much. In some places people
told Me, “Our guru is very soft – we must

11:09.209 --> 11:16.209
get some strong fellow.”
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

11:40.529 --> 11:47.529
good. But should not compromise with nonsense
and laziness. Because the first thing, people

11:54.930 --> 12:01.930
get into is laziness after Sahaja Yoga. We
have to be committed. Now I too have a family

12:11.010 --> 12:18.010
and I have grandchildren. My daughter has
come all the way to see Me in London. She’s

12:20.250 --> 12:27.250
been there for one month and I haven’t been
there yet. She’s waiting for Me.

12:38.260 --> 12:45.260
So it’s all right, one has to do it. This
is My commitment, because this is your purpose

12:50.990 --> 12:57.990
of life. And the purpose that you have mainly
is to ascend and help others to ascend. You

13:07.850 --> 13:14.850
are special people, who have to do such a
tremendous task. Otherwise how can we have

13:18.459 --> 13:25.459
lots of people coming to Sahaja Yoga? So the
Sahaja way is to yourself improve with meditation

13:37.570 --> 13:44.570
and introspect yourself and see yourself.
You must meditate and you should not see the

13:51.300 --> 13:57.339
defects of others.

13:57.339 --> 14:04.339
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.
If you do not meet collectively every day,

14:13.449 --> 14:20.449
then there will be a problem. In the collective
only the maturity starts. It is a living process

14:25.019 --> 14:32.019
as I told you. Now supposing a tree is growing
and you take out a leaf from there and the

14:38.639 --> 14:45.639
leaf will say, “I’m going to grow by myself.”
It cannot grow. It will be left out. So that

14:56.670 --> 15:03.670
is what one has to remember: that it is a
collective happening. We all have to meet

15:07.259 --> 15:11.290
and grow together.

15:11.290 --> 15:18.290
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf. I

15:26.920 --> 15:33.920
think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening. It is just like a

15:38.610 --> 15:45.610
tree growing and with the tree everything
else that belongs to tree also grows. So for

15:54.060 --> 16:01.060
the growth of this tree one has to remember
that you have to stick onto the tree. But

16:04.800 --> 16:11.800
the tree is not going to run after you, “Stick
on, stick on to me, stick on to me.” For

16:17.529 --> 16:24.529
that whatever has to be done, has to be done.
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves

16:32.019 --> 16:39.019
fall off. What they do is to create a barrier
between themselves and the tree by some living

16:41.759 --> 16:48.759
process. They create a barrier in between,
there's a little bark that comes in between.

16:54.920 --> 17:01.920
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

17:09.710 --> 17:16.710
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga. When
you do not accept the principle of Sahaja

17:22.130 --> 17:29.130
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap
and
the leaf. Now when that happens, the leaf

17:41.220 --> 17:48.220
falls off. So you have to open out yourself,
your heart, everything to suck in the sap

17:49.980 --> 17:56.980
to nourish. You have to give up your Ego and
Superego, your conditionings and ideas you

18:09.540 --> 18:16.540
have had from before. This is what is the
surrender, is the Islam. And that is to be

18:27.310 --> 18:34.310
achieved. But that is not going to help the
tree, it is going to help you. Now some people

18:39.530 --> 18:46.530
say, “I'm not ready.” Then how will you
grow? Actually when a little child is born,

18:50.700 --> 18:57.700
immediately it wants to suck in the mother's
nourishment. It feels it has starved all this

19:03.570 --> 19:10.570
time and it should suck mother's milk immediately.
And all those are seekers, once they find

19:18.650 --> 19:25.650
their Realization must behave in that manner.
They should all give up all the conditionings

19:30.280 --> 19:37.280
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately
push themselves and also cleanse themselves

19:45.200 --> 19:52.200
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

19:55.730 --> 20:02.730
But it does not happen that way. That's why
some people do not grow that fast. It is a

20:09.890 --> 20:16.890
pure intelligence that gives you that sense
I think. Pure intelligence comes from pure

20:20.240 --> 20:27.240
heart and if you pay more attention to your
heart, your Spirit, then it will work out.

20:36.450 --> 20:43.450
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed. Not only

20:51.460 --> 20:58.460
that you’ll have the blessings but you will
have jobs, you will have money or else children

21:05.080 --> 21:12.080
will pass with flying colors. They will become
obedient. Your health will improve, you will

21:18.760 --> 21:25.760
get money, you will get married, you will
have nice children, wise wife, you’ll get

21:36.010 --> 21:43.010
homes and ashrams. But these are all temptations.
Many people get lost in one of those. Now

21:56.350 --> 22:03.350
supposing I've to catch the plane and on the
way I see very nice gardens or things, then

22:09.900 --> 22:16.900
I get down to enjoy the gardens, how will
I reach the airport and the aeroplane? So

22:23.240 --> 22:30.240
these temptations must be seen as just entertainments…
as entertainments. Entertainment, all right?

22:47.910 --> 22:54.910
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it. But if you start

23:06.680 --> 23:13.680
thinking you’ll go mad. How can you explain
that a person just like you can give Realization

23:16.870 --> 23:23.870
to thousands? How can you explain that you
can see the sun on My heart in a picture?

23:36.140 --> 23:43.140
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain? For example, you get My photographs

23:46.210 --> 23:53.210
in the sky, is a fact. How will you explain
that? So it is beyond your brains. So better

24:02.370 --> 24:09.370
not think about it. Just gradually accept
the joy. I always say I've done the cooking

24:13.310 --> 24:20.310
for you and very good food. Now only thing
is for you to eat it and taste it. Why do

24:31.600 --> 24:38.600
you want to know, how it was cooked, when
it was kept and what else has been done to

24:39.270 --> 24:46.270
make it so tasty? You should just appreciate
and enjoy. Like a painting you have, you don't

24:59.400 --> 25:06.400
think, “From where did he get the paint,
how did he paint and how was he sitting, what

25:15.430 --> 25:18.850
food he must have taken, before or after?”

25:18.850 --> 25:25.850
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know. It's very surprising, that

25:32.750 --> 25:39.580
people do not understand one simple thing:
that Kundalini has risen without thinking

25:39.580 --> 25:46.580
and not by our effort. The Kundalini has given
us this good health, good temperament and

25:58.950 --> 26:05.950
has changed us so much. So She is going to
do the job, only thing we should try to support

26:10.270 --> 26:17.270
Her and to keep our central path clean. It's
very simple.

26:23.150 --> 26:30.150
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

26:30.540 --> 26:36.500
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

26:36.500 --> 26:42.770
come to India. But try to come, because those
who have been to India have settled down much

26:42.770 --> 26:49.770
better, because India has got something magical
about it, that it transforms people to a deeper

26:51.300 --> 26:58.300
level. You should not come half heartedly.
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

27:51.580 --> 27:56.570
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

27:56.570 --> 28:03.570
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything. You
have to come with full force, as I told you

28:14.120 --> 28:21.120
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.
Don't play into the tricks of your mind. It's

28:33.610 --> 28:40.610
like a donkey - if you take a donkey lightly,
then it will just start grazing anywhere it

28:46.250 --> 28:53.250
finds grass. And if it knows that the person
sitting on his back is a lousy fellow or a

29:01.240 --> 29:08.240
lazy person, it will drop him. And when it
knows that it can go ahead of the person then

29:15.430 --> 29:22.430
it can even kick you back. That is how your
mind is. It dominates you, it sometimes starts

29:33.040 --> 29:40.040
grazing on pastures and you think that's a
very good thing, you are very peaceful or

29:45.570 --> 29:52.570
else it starts dominating you. So how to manage
this donkey? Best way is to catch hold of

30:02.890 --> 30:09.890
the ears, and carry it with you. Donkey is
for you, you are not for the donkey. So this

30:20.300 --> 30:27.300
is one of the hurdles, that we have very much.

30:31.190 --> 30:38.190
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

30:41.170 --> 30:48.170
not by brain, but by heart. I have known people
who can give big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,

30:57.840 --> 31:04.840
can write books, but have no vibrations. So
this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is. You have

31:07.420 --> 31:14.420
to be a Yogi. That's a religion in a way in
our being. That's the religion of a Yogi.

31:26.700 --> 31:33.700
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies. And the

31:39.140 --> 31:46.140
eleventh valency integrates you with the religion.
You get identified with righteousness, with

31:59.040 --> 32:06.040
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance
- or also detachment. That means you do not

32:24.810 --> 32:31.810
expect anything. You do it for doing’s sake.
You love for loving’s sake. That's the best

32:38.330 --> 32:45.330
way to enjoy. You enjoy your loving capacity.
You enjoy your generosity. You enjoy your

32:54.980 --> 33:01.980
forgiveness. Enjoy all these great qualities
of righteousness. You’ll never feel hurt.

33:15.400 --> 33:22.400
I do that all the time. That's how I'm always
happy and full of joy.

33:26.750 --> 33:30.810
May God bless you!
