00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.170
October 9, 1987
Mahalakshmi Puja, Belgium

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.170
It was so very nice to come to Belgium and
have so many people for our program and I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.960
must say, now we are getting to people who
are very sensitive. [translation follows - yes]

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.640
It is a .. it is a new dimension I think,
I feel, we are entering into. Because now

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.620
we are really getting people who are seriously
interested in their realization and are very

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.880
respectful. And that aggressiveness is much
less. You don’t find anybody being aggressive.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.950
So we can say, that now the road is paved
for all of you to work it out in a Sahaj manner

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:46.139
to bring them properly to Sahaja Yoga and
settle them nicely. Now this Sahaj manner

00:01:53.139 --> 00:02:00.139
should be understood. In a Sahaj manner, when
they come to you, you must know they are absolutely

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:10.359
new to Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.610
So first and foremost thing, you should not
talk about Me. You should not tell them anything

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.750
about Me; but you have to tell them about
Sahaja Yoga and about yourself. Like you can

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.379
say, “I had the same problem as you have.”
Or you can say that “See, it took me more

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.840
time then it
took you.” It’s a little lie, but doesn’t
matter. [Shri Mataji laughs.] You see, because

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.140
first of all, you must understand human beings.
If you tell them directly “You are bad”

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.450
or “You are evil; you are bootish” then
they will run away, though it is true.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:44.099
A lady from France came to see Me. She said
that “They told me I’m evil.” So I said,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.620
“No, no you are not. Who told you that?”
And gradually she improved. So you have to

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.260
tell them that “You are the Spirit” and
whatever is hanging on to them will be dropped

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.640
out
and will be cleared out by their Kundalini.
So if that happens they feel happy and they

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.620
get their benevolence. It is how beautifully
you handle another person.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:59.199
Now there maybe people who want to argue.
With them you should say, “You know, you

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:10.479
cannot argue it out, because it is beyond
human awareness.” And you better tell them

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.810
that it is … “You better take your Realization,
then we will talk about it. Not before your

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.410
Realization.” So then, if they are not getting
any Realization, you don’t tell them that

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:40.410
“There is a bhoot sitting in your left Nabhi
or right Nabhi.” This is our language – Sahaja

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:54.449
Yogi’s language, not their language. Ya,
so you have to be very careful to handle them

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.930
very carefully.
Now there could be a problem between, say,

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:14.289
a sad man’s parent’s mother and a daughter
or maybe husband and wife. So …

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:22.410
(Just a minute, this side - listen to Me,
all right? All of you should pay attention

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:38.379
to Me. All right? No, no it’s all right.
Let her be there. It’s all right, but she

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.500
should pay attention this time, all right?
Sit down.)

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.500
So we have to tell them that “You carry
on, don’t worry about it, because the inner

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:02.979
joy will start giving you strength.”
Then gradually the another partner will understand
you -
see you’re honest, your purpose and would

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:34.560
try to appreciate you. Gradually it works
out. But if it does not, then we’ll see

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:46.080
about it. Now when you handle them with love
and care, you can establish them. But if they

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:09.009
start misbehaving you also should not lose
temper at all. You should be very forgiving.

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:24.639
Now I must say, that in Sahaja Yoga you have
to respect your leaders. Of course, you might

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:38.150
not find them perfect, maybe. Or maybe
you may find them to be little bossy, possibly.
But you need some bossing sometimes. And leaders

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:07.390
must know how to also correct people, because
you need correction. I met a lady, I was telling

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:21.269
you, we had told them, that you need not have
a guru. So, she said “No, no we must have

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:32.740
somebody to guide us. And that guru will guide
us and also will support us, so we would like

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:47.010
to follow him. In spite of the fact he is
a very bossy fellow and he always gets annoyed

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:54.290
with us and he takes money from us. And it’s
not a guru, if he’s not, if he is very soft,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:10.560
means he should not be kind.”

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:22.200
So we have another kind also of people who
want somebody to dominate
them for their spiritual ascent. They are

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:39.810
better people, because they want their ascent
in any case. And they accept corrections,

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:54.490
because they want their ascent. That’s the
first thing. So even if the leader bosses,

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:03.550
they like it very much. In some places people
told Me, “Our guru is very soft – we must

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:16.209
get some strong fellow.”
So I leave it to the leaders, who are called
as gurus by some people to be kind, compassionate,

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:47.529
good. But should not compromise with nonsense
and laziness. Because the first thing, people

00:11:54.930 --> 00:12:01.930
get into is laziness after Sahaja Yoga. We
have to be committed. Now I too have a family

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:18.010
and I have grandchildren. My daughter has
come all the way to see Me in London. She’s

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:27.250
been there for one month and I haven’t been
there yet. She’s waiting for Me.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:45.260
So it’s all right, one has to do it. This
is My commitment, because this is your purpose

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:57.990
of life. And the purpose that you have mainly
is to ascend and help others to ascend. You

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:14.850
are special people, who have to do such a
tremendous task. Otherwise how can we have

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:25.459
lots of people coming to Sahaja Yoga? So the
Sahaja way is to yourself improve with meditation

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:44.570
and introspect yourself and see yourself.
You must meditate and you should not see the

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.339
defects of others.

00:13:57.339 --> 00:14:04.339
The second thing to be Sahaj is to be collective.
If you do not meet collectively every day,

00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:20.449
then there will be a problem. In the collective
only the maturity starts. It is a living process

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:32.019
as I told you. Now supposing a tree is growing
and you take out a leaf from there and the

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:45.639
leaf will say, “I’m going to grow by myself.”
It cannot grow. It will be left out. So that

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:03.670
is what one has to remember: that it is a
collective happening. We all have to meet

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:11.290
and grow together.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:18.290
Now, those who are not collective will disappear
one day into thin air, like a dead leaf. I

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:33.920
think people don’t understand the meaning
of collective happening. It is just like a

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:45.610
tree growing and with the tree everything
else that belongs to tree also grows. So for

00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:01.060
the growth of this tree one has to remember
that you have to stick onto the tree. But

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:11.800
the tree is not going to run after you, “Stick
on, stick on to me, stick on to me.” For

00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:24.529
that whatever has to be done, has to be done.
You know, when the winter comes, all the leaves

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:39.019
fall off. What they do is to create a barrier
between themselves and the tree by some living

00:16:41.759 --> 00:16:48.759
process. They create a barrier in between,
there's a little bark that comes in between.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:01.920
Now when that happens the leaves fall off
and the tree becomes barren.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:16.710
Now same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga. When
you do not accept the principle of Sahaja

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:29.130
Yoga you put a barrier in between the sap
and
the leaf. Now when that happens, the leaf

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:48.220
falls off. So you have to open out yourself,
your heart, everything to suck in the sap

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:56.980
to nourish. You have to give up your Ego and
Superego, your conditionings and ideas you

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:16.540
have had from before. This is what is the
surrender, is the Islam. And that is to be

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:34.310
achieved. But that is not going to help the
tree, it is going to help you. Now some people

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:46.530
say, “I'm not ready.” Then how will you
grow? Actually when a little child is born,

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:57.700
immediately it wants to suck in the mother's
nourishment. It feels it has starved all this

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:10.570
time and it should suck mother's milk immediately.
And all those are seekers, once they find

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:25.650
their Realization must behave in that manner.
They should all give up all the conditionings

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:37.280
and all these nonsensical ideas and immediately
push themselves and also cleanse themselves

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.200
fully to suck in more and more of this nourishment.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:02.730
But it does not happen that way. That's why
some people do not grow that fast. It is a

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:16.890
pure intelligence that gives you that sense
I think. Pure intelligence comes from pure

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:27.240
heart and if you pay more attention to your
heart, your Spirit, then it will work out.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:43.450
In the course of your movement in Sahaja Yoga
you will see you’ll be blessed. Not only

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:58.460
that you’ll have the blessings but you will
have jobs, you will have money or else children

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.080
will pass with flying colors. They will become
obedient. Your health will improve, you will

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:25.760
get money, you will get married, you will
have nice children, wise wife, you’ll get

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:43.010
homes and ashrams. But these are all temptations.
Many people get lost in one of those. Now

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:03.350
supposing I've to catch the plane and on the
way I see very nice gardens or things, then

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:16.900
I get down to enjoy the gardens, how will
I reach the airport and the aeroplane? So

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:30.240
these temptations must be seen as just entertainments…
as entertainments. Entertainment, all right?

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:54.910
Now our understanding of Sahaj is simple if
you do not think about it. But if you start

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:13.680
thinking you’ll go mad. How can you explain
that a person just like you can give Realization

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:23.870
to thousands? How can you explain that you
can see the sun on My heart in a picture?

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:43.140
All this pictures which are there, how can
you explain? For example, you get My photographs

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:53.210
in the sky, is a fact. How will you explain
that? So it is beyond your brains. So better

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:09.370
not think about it. Just gradually accept
the joy. I always say I've done the cooking

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:20.310
for you and very good food. Now only thing
is for you to eat it and taste it. Why do

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:38.600
you want to know, how it was cooked, when
it was kept and what else has been done to

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:46.270
make it so tasty? You should just appreciate
and enjoy. Like a painting you have, you don't

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:06.400
think, “From where did he get the paint,
how did he paint and how was he sitting, what

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.850
food he must have taken, before or after?”

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:25.850
But in Sahaja Yoga we do these ridiculous
things, you know. It's very surprising, that

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:39.580
people do not understand one simple thing:
that Kundalini has risen without thinking

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:46.580
and not by our effort. The Kundalini has given
us this good health, good temperament and

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:05.950
has changed us so much. So She is going to
do the job, only thing we should try to support

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:17.270
Her and to keep our central path clean. It's
very simple.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:30.150
So now I feel very much encouraged to that
from Holland and from Belgium we have such

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:36.500
nice Sahaja Yogis here, and also I would say
it is rather difficult for some people to

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:42.770
come to India. But try to come, because those
who have been to India have settled down much

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:49.770
better, because India has got something magical
about it, that it transforms people to a deeper

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:58.300
level. You should not come half heartedly.
I feel that those who can come on [literally??

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.570
– UNCLEAR] should not find excuses, “I'm
not ready, I'm not thinking”, because such

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:03.570
half hearted people are not going to gain
anything. You
have to come with full force, as I told you

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:21.120
the newly born child, otherwise it is useless.
Don't play into the tricks of your mind. It's

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:40.610
like a donkey - if you take a donkey lightly,
then it will just start grazing anywhere it

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:53.250
finds grass. And if it knows that the person
sitting on his back is a lousy fellow or a

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:08.240
lazy person, it will drop him. And when it
knows that it can go ahead of the person then

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:22.430
it can even kick you back. That is how your
mind is. It dominates you, it sometimes starts

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:40.040
grazing on pastures and you think that's a
very good thing, you are very peaceful or

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:52.570
else it starts dominating you. So how to manage
this donkey? Best way is to catch hold of

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:09.890
the ears, and carry it with you. Donkey is
for you, you are not for the donkey. So this

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:27.300
is one of the hurdles, that we have very much.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:38.190
As far as you all are concerned you have to
know that Sahaja Yoga is to be understood

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:48.170
not by brain, but by heart. I have known people
who can give big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.840
can write books, but have no vibrations. So
this is not the way Sahaja Yoga is. You have

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:14.420
to be a Yogi. That's a religion in a way in
our being. That's the religion of a Yogi.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:33.700
Like human beings have ten valencies, a Yogi
must have at least eleven valencies. And the

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:46.140
eleventh valency integrates you with the religion.
You get identified with righteousness, with

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:06.040
compassion, with love, with assiduity - perseverance
- or also detachment. That means you do not

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:31.810
expect anything. You do it for doing’s sake.
You love for loving’s sake. That's the best

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:45.330
way to enjoy. You enjoy your loving capacity.
You enjoy your generosity. You enjoy your

00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:01.980
forgiveness. Enjoy all these great qualities
of righteousness. You’ll never feel hurt.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:22.400
I do that all the time. That's how I'm always
happy and full of joy.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.810
May God bless you!
