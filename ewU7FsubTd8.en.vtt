00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:03.920
When the Kuṇḍalinī rises

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.262
it makes sounds.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.577
And the sounds that are heard

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:18.709
in the different chakras can be pronounced

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:23.235
in the following way –

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:27.960
these pronunciations are being used

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:32.300
in the phonetic language of Devanāgarī,

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:38.089
which means ‘the language spoken by the Devās’.

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:44.461
At the Moolādhāra(Mūlādhāra),

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.198
where there are four petals,

00:00:52.882 --> 00:01:02.206
the sounds are: व-va, श-śa, ष-ṣa, स-sa .

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:09.306
Out of which the lasts, ष-ṣa and स-sa

00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:14.543
sounds are very close,

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:25.197
 but the difference is – when the snake hisses

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:34.833
it makes this ष-ṣa – the third sound.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:44.717
So, व-va, श-śa,  ष-ṣa, स-sa.

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:53.921
At the Swādhiṣhṭhāna, where there are six petals,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:11.856
it makes sounds, six sounds:

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:32.335

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:11.848

At the Viśhuddhi, where there are sixteen petals,

00:03:49.988 --> 00:03:57.289

At the Āgñyā chakra it makes ह-ha, क्ष-kṣa.

00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:43.155
At the Sahasrāra, one becomes

00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:51.061
thoughtless, and no sound is made.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.165
But the pure Anāhata,

00:04:54.762 --> 00:05:00.336
meaning the throbbing in the purest form

00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:07.797
as in the heart is all: lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub.

00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:18.645
When all these sounds are sounded together

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:30.956
and pass through the spiral of the body,

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.944
if the body is like a conch,

00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:54.056
the sound that comes out of the synthesis is ॐ Aum(A-u-m).

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.055
Like the seven colours of the Sun

00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:09.050
ultimately become white rays,

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:16.672
or you can say the golden coloured rays.

00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:29.601

00:07:51.573 --> 00:08:02.179
Viṣhṇu-granthi when mixes up with the Suryā,

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:12.509
that is between the Nābhī and the Hṛidaya(heart) chakra,

00:08:14.018 --> 00:08:17.276
Surya Viṣhṇu-granthi is established.

00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:40.042
When Viśhuddhi and Āgñyā aurās

meet, then Chandra Rudra-granthi is established.

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:31.435
