00:00:00.426 --> 00:00:03.920
When the Kundalini rises

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.262
it makes sounds.

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.577
And the sounds that are heard

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:18.709
in the different chakras can be pronounced

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:23.235
in the following way –

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:27.960
these pronunciations are being used

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:32.300
in the phonetic language of Devanagari,

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:38.089
which means ‘the language spoken by the Devas’.

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:44.461
At the Mooladhara,

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:52.198
where there are four petals,

00:00:52.882 --> 00:01:02.206
the sounds are: [vum, shum, sshum, sum].

00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:09.306
Out of which the lasts, sshum and sum

00:01:11.492 --> 00:01:14.543
sounds are very close,

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:25.197
 but the difference is – when the snake hisses

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:34.833
it makes this sshum – the third sound.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:44.717
So, vum, shum, sshum, sum.

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:53.921
At the Swadishthana, where there are six petals,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:11.856

At the Agnya chakra it makes ha, ksha.

00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:43.155
At the Sahasrara, one becomes

00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:51.061
thoughtless, and no sound is made.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.165
But the pure Anahata,

00:04:54.762 --> 00:05:00.336

00:05:00.674 --> 00:05:07.797
as in the heart is all: lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub.

00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:18.645
When all these sounds are sounded together

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:30.956
and pass through the spiral of the body,

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.944

00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:54.056
the sound that comes out of the synthesis is Aum.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.055
