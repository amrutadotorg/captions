WEBVTT

00:59.231 --> 01:05.412
Beautiful, isn’t it? Tremendous!

02:17.658 --> 02:22.664
If you can get from My purse - he’s got.

02:30.888 --> 02:34.491
Somebody has to translate Me.

02:40.940 --> 02:45.747
All right. And in Italian,

02:45.962 --> 02:49.962
Italian language?

02:50.862 --> 02:54.692
Italy – Italian, some…?  Yogi: Shri Mataji,
I can only in French.

02:54.893 --> 02:58.516
Shri Mataji: Only French, all right.

03:39.307 --> 03:42.885
It is so wonderful for your Mother

03:43.086 --> 03:47.425
to see so many beautiful Sahaja yogis
assembled together,

03:47.626 --> 03:52.069
on this day of Sahasrara.

04:07.877 --> 04:15.950
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga
has ended now, and new has started.

04:23.170 --> 04:29.489
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

04:29.690 --> 04:35.898
the starting point was first the opening
of the Sahasrara.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.602
And gradually –

04:55.945 --> 05:02.110
(it’s not on My…, that’s the point, it’s…
that’s better) –

05:03.304 --> 05:10.304
and gradually moving towards the completion,

05:11.229 --> 05:20.641
I find there are so many who are great
Sahaja yogis today.

05:32.829 --> 05:41.135
It is a very natural process of growth
that you have gone through.

05:47.871 --> 05:56.908
The first one was, we can say, is just
the awakening of the Kundalini,

06:01.605 --> 06:08.220
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

06:12.285 --> 06:17.085
As you see on top of your head these
bandhans,

06:17.293 --> 06:22.173
that's how you too have in your head,
same way.

06:28.508 --> 06:36.069
And you have the chakras same way built in,
in your Sahasrara.

06:43.445 --> 06:49.365
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have
awakened

06:49.589 --> 06:54.028
the deities in your centers,

06:54.229 --> 07:01.349
in the medulla oblongata and also in
the brain.

07:10.461 --> 07:19.572
But now the time has come for us to
spread it on a horizontal level.

07:25.908 --> 07:34.583
And to move it on the horizontal level,
we have to understand how to go about it.

07:45.589 --> 07:51.229
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

07:51.429 --> 08:00.029
we have got seven colors of the light
of these centers, of the chakras.

08:07.668 --> 08:15.130
And when we start it from the back,
from the Mooladhara,

08:15.331 --> 08:23.760
bringing it up to the,
this side, Agnya,

08:23.950 --> 08:30.388
then it is placed in a different order,
if you see it clearly.

08:49.149 --> 08:56.789
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

08:56.989 --> 09:01.389
because it's a concave replacement,

09:01.589 --> 09:08.228
is important to understand that the center

09:08.429 --> 09:18.252
of the fontanel bone area corresponds
to our heart.

09:33.389 --> 09:41.789
So heart is the pivotal point for
the second Era now.

09:58.397 --> 10:02.195
I hope you understand what I mean.

10:05.348 --> 10:11.230
So if you have to place your attention
to Sahasrara,

10:11.431 --> 10:17.379
first thing you have to do is to pay
attention to your heart.

10:27.669 --> 10:35.349
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and
the heart itself,

10:35.549 --> 10:39.909
the Atma, coincide.

10:46.677 --> 10:56.629
Means the Jagadamba becomes one
with the heart – that is the Atma.

11:08.989 --> 11:13.976
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

11:19.604 --> 11:28.444
At this point of time it is very important
to understand

11:28.669 --> 11:34.309
that we have to take a bigger step.

11:45.149 --> 11:52.148
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

11:52.349 --> 12:01.150
all these chakras throw their lights
in this way, in a clockwise manner;

12:01.351 --> 12:09.010
and this axis is the heart.

12:26.069 --> 12:35.668
So the essence of all the religions, of all
the prophets, of all the incarnations

12:35.874 --> 12:42.637
is compassion, and it’s placed in this
Chakra of Heart.

12:57.181 --> 13:06.523
Thus we understand that in the second
Era now, we have to have compassion.

13:17.189 --> 13:22.909
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

13:26.180 --> 13:30.788
If God Almighty had no compassion,

13:30.989 --> 13:40.553
He would not have created this great
universe.

13:46.749 --> 13:55.318
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,
is the embodiment of His compassion.

14:02.925 --> 14:11.270
And this compassion has brought forth
all the evolution to human level,

14:11.471 --> 14:17.009
and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

14:26.949 --> 14:35.913
And compassion is always completely covered
with forgiveness.

14:44.804 --> 14:50.587
So you can see, the Trinity meets
at this point.

14:53.549 --> 15:03.906
The Son of God is forgiveness,
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

15:08.925 --> 15:14.205
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

15:15.109 --> 15:19.949
the Mother who is the compassion and
the Child who is the forgiveness,

15:20.149 --> 15:26.705
all of them meet at Heart Chakra,
in the Sahasrara.

15:42.285 --> 15:52.884
Now, one must learn how to improve
Sahasrara itself.

16:01.045 --> 16:06.642
You know the presiding deity
of the Sahasrara very well.

16:13.669 --> 16:24.028
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,
as you think it to be,

16:24.229 --> 16:29.809
but it’s just the center of the whole
universe.

16:39.405 --> 16:44.548
To develop this, you have to pay attention

16:44.749 --> 16:51.358
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone
area.

17:04.448 --> 17:09.122
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone
area,

17:09.323 --> 17:16.071
then there you must establish the deity.

17:27.893 --> 17:34.693
But this deity has to be first established
into the heart.

17:39.133 --> 17:45.521
Now you are very lucky people that you have
the deity in person with you.

17:58.317 --> 18:03.708
The people who got realization before
I came on this Earth

18:03.909 --> 18:07.602
had to imagine the deities,

18:15.709 --> 18:21.829
and in that imagination they were never
perfect.

18:26.382 --> 18:32.422
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is
Mahamaya –

18:37.205 --> 18:40.821
that is how it is described –

18:41.405 --> 18:48.934
so if you also see the person, you
may not be knowing fully that person

18:49.135 --> 18:53.764
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

19:01.293 --> 19:07.053
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater
than your imagination.

19:13.444 --> 19:17.164
That is why one has to surrender.

19:18.612 --> 19:24.451
With your limited imagination of brain,

19:24.652 --> 19:31.018
one cannot see the deity.

19:36.629 --> 19:41.124
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:
you can know through bhakti,

19:41.325 --> 19:44.509
through devotion.

19:49.470 --> 19:53.801
So the devotion has to be there, but
the devotion has to be

19:54.002 --> 19:59.946
a very clean devotion, in the sense there
should be no malice in the heart.

20:00.147 --> 20:03.428
Heart should be clean.

20:11.445 --> 20:16.841
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

20:22.349 --> 20:30.994
Always human beings have a relative
understanding of reality,

20:33.669 --> 20:37.509
but reality is absolute.

20:38.909 --> 20:47.784
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of
all the other kind of impurities

20:47.985 --> 20:51.548
that are within the heart.

20:56.613 --> 21:04.940
So in the beginning we try to achieve
our realization,

21:05.141 --> 21:08.822
not with very clean heart.

21:16.965 --> 21:21.662
At that time we had lots of attachments,

21:22.749 --> 21:27.726
we were identified with false things.

21:30.354 --> 21:40.319
And also we thought by getting realization
we’ll become very powerful people.

21:49.549 --> 21:57.749
After realization also, we started
indulging into petty things.

22:04.148 --> 22:13.382
We started asking for favors for our
relations, friends, mothers, sisters;

22:17.293 --> 22:26.599
and the women thought of their husbands
and their brothers, children.

22:29.504 --> 22:38.177
They all asked for the blessings of all
those with whom they were entangled.

22:48.429 --> 22:54.762
All this entanglement you got over, I know,
very soon.

23:04.829 --> 23:15.458
Now the job of a Avatara is such that He
has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

23:18.976 --> 23:24.875
(Repeats to the interpreter) ...job of
an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill,

23:25.076 --> 23:32.749
He has to fulfill the desires of His
bhaktas, His disciples.

23:45.749 --> 23:52.165
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by
gopis that, “We want You to be with us,

23:52.366 --> 23:56.206
individually, with every one of us.”

24:05.365 --> 24:13.537
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,
and He was with every one of them.

24:20.389 --> 24:24.733
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

24:24.934 --> 24:29.473
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

24:31.461 --> 24:35.803
But when you asked Me about your
brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers,

24:36.004 --> 24:41.309
I tried to do that, whatever was possible.

24:46.869 --> 24:52.650
Also the kshema that you asked for,
ashrams you asked for,

24:52.851 --> 24:56.971
all the things that you needed,

24:58.589 --> 25:05.190
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

25:14.965 --> 25:19.389
So at the Krishna's level it was: "Yoga
kshemam vahamyaham."

25:19.589 --> 25:24.105
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's
level,

25:33.493 --> 25:36.933
because it was promised.

25:38.189 --> 25:43.062
But what next, in the new Era that has
to come?

25:48.189 --> 25:55.064
As you have now good families, good
ashrams, good jobs,

25:55.265 --> 26:01.243
everyone is happy, let us think of the next
Era.

26:16.173 --> 26:21.053
Next Era is of compassion, as I told you.

26:23.525 --> 26:29.198
But any one of the chakras are weak in you
still;

26:32.637 --> 26:37.557
the light that becomes white because
of the seven colors

26:37.758 --> 26:43.161
may dim out, or may be defective.

26:50.301 --> 26:57.164
So, all the chakras that are within us are
to be looked after.

27:02.525 --> 27:10.860
To pay attention to every chakra, and put
compassion,

27:11.061 --> 27:16.693
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

27:31.309 --> 27:35.767
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

27:39.269 --> 27:43.760
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha

27:43.961 --> 27:52.509
and establish Him through your thought –
because now your thought is divine –

27:52.709 --> 27:57.549
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great
respect.

28:18.828 --> 28:25.977
Here now, you have to know that
in the first era of Sahaja Yoga

28:26.178 --> 28:29.395
I could not have talked of these things
to you, of …

28:29.596 --> 28:36.629
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

28:42.749 --> 28:47.949
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

28:48.149 --> 28:56.149
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

29:01.429 --> 29:04.743
And that's the country.

29:06.477 --> 29:11.108
Now when you put your attention onto
that chakra,

29:11.309 --> 29:16.269
put your feelings towards Him,

29:23.989 --> 29:32.909
of feeling of love and adoration to Him,
to begin with.

29:37.149 --> 29:43.835
And then to manifest compassion, you have
to ask nothing but one thing,

29:44.036 --> 29:55.921
that, "O God of Innocence, give innocence
to all the people of the world."

30:05.613 --> 30:11.426
But first you have to be innocent to ask
that; otherwise,

30:11.627 --> 30:18.469
it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,
you have no right to ask.

30:27.389 --> 30:34.821
So to understand innocence you should
try to understand yourself,

30:35.022 --> 30:39.029
how your mind is working.

30:44.797 --> 30:49.414
When you, say, look at anyone,

30:49.614 --> 30:54.828
do you feel that you should possess that
person?

30:55.029 --> 31:04.360
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something
base feeling comes into your mind?

31:18.471 --> 31:23.357
For an innocent person, when he sees
a beautiful person,

31:23.558 --> 31:28.909
or a woman, or a beautiful scene or
a beautiful creation,

31:29.109 --> 31:35.105
the first thing should happen that he
becomes thoughtless – there’s no thought.

31:48.709 --> 31:53.431
So if there is no thought, there's
no question of having

31:53.632 --> 32:00.707
any expression of possessiveness or
any kind of a baser feeling.

32:12.509 --> 32:19.035
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also
unauthorized a little bit, that,

32:19.236 --> 32:27.909
"Please make me innocent, so that I'm
empowered to ask You for this boon,

32:28.109 --> 32:37.909
that wherever I go I become the source
of innocence.

32:51.448 --> 32:58.765
So that I emit innocence: when people
look at me,

32:58.966 --> 33:02.749
they feel I am innocent."

33:10.413 --> 33:13.493
This is compassion,

33:15.029 --> 33:24.951
the compassion to ask Him to give you
the power of compassion itself.

33:35.413 --> 33:41.545
So that, as you see here these beautiful
centers,

33:41.746 --> 33:48.869
as if the light starts moving horizontally;

34:00.389 --> 34:07.218
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous
system.

34:09.149 --> 34:15.564
So you become the powerful innocence
yourself.

34:19.109 --> 34:26.137
You don't become stupid or childish, but
you become child-like.

34:32.509 --> 34:40.549
The whole behavior is extremely dignified
and innocent.

34:44.349 --> 34:48.016
Normally if you find a person who is
dignified,

34:48.217 --> 34:53.177
is normally, he’s not an innocent person,

34:56.973 --> 35:01.052
because he puts up a show – it's
a deliberation to become serious

35:01.253 --> 35:06.308
and show that he’s very dignified,
to impress others.

35:12.373 --> 35:21.156
And child doesn’t put up the show
of innocence, of dignity or anything,

35:21.357 --> 35:27.070
because the child is not aware
of deliberations.

35:35.845 --> 35:43.088
But you develop that rare combination
of innocent dignity.

35:52.149 --> 35:58.504
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha
starts expressing itself

35:58.705 --> 36:07.073
on horizontal level, that you become
discreet.

36:15.413 --> 36:22.367
But that is a power, I'm again saying,
the power of discretion you develop.

36:26.709 --> 36:31.242
Now one must understand the difference
between the power of discretion,

36:31.443 --> 36:35.029
and discretion itself.

36:38.061 --> 36:42.236
So “the power” means it acts.

36:46.525 --> 36:50.241
For example, you may not speak,

36:50.442 --> 36:58.267
but if you are standing somewhere the
discretion itself will act in the situation.

37:06.829 --> 37:11.944
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good
Sahaja yogi, is going in a train,

37:12.145 --> 37:19.240
and the train has an accident – mostly it
will not have, but has – nobody will die.

37:30.396 --> 37:38.837
So you establish the discretion which is
power itself,

37:39.038 --> 37:44.429
that acts by itself. You don't have to say
that you act, it acts,

37:44.630 --> 37:48.718
but you just become the vehicle,
a beautiful clean vehicle

37:48.919 --> 37:52.320
of that discretion.

38:05.934 --> 38:12.428
Then you should believe, now you are
spreading horizontally.

38:21.749 --> 38:30.374
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga, you needed
to see Me in person.

38:31.565 --> 38:35.972
(Repeats to the interpreter:) You needed
to see Me in person.

38:39.909 --> 38:45.003
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”:
is the target.

38:45.204 --> 38:49.289
You wanted the target in front of you.

38:57.091 --> 39:00.723
(To the interpreter:) But see, there’s
no word in English!

39:00.950 --> 39:06.261
Dhyeya: whatever is to be achieved.

39:09.309 --> 39:12.148
Because there’s no word in the English
language, what to do?

39:12.349 --> 39:16.163
So now when you wanted that all the time,

39:16.364 --> 39:21.850
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

39:22.051 --> 39:26.891
when you had that in person before you.

39:37.608 --> 39:44.967
Then in the second era, now, you will not
desire so much

39:45.168 --> 39:50.881
that Mother should be there – you'll take
it over from Me.

40:04.789 --> 40:10.039
This is the divine desire I'm telling you
about,

40:12.789 --> 40:19.127
and you have to work on that from today
onwards.

40:25.592 --> 40:29.351
I am with you, you know that; but need not
be in this body,

40:29.552 --> 40:34.396
because I don’t know if I exist in this
body or not.

40:40.804 --> 40:48.778
But once this desire starts working, you
will see tremendous miracles happening.

40:57.429 --> 41:05.726
When the child is born to a mother,
automatically she gets milk.

41:11.601 --> 41:16.688
So the nature is so connected with
the whole thing.

41:16.889 --> 41:22.008
In your divine desire also it is connected.

41:30.925 --> 41:36.250
And it is very evident when you are
a divine person.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.865
So you may find Me anywhere: you are
walking on the street,

41:42.066 --> 41:46.949
suddenly you might find Mataji walking
with you.

41:59.065 --> 42:05.840
So this is the second Era we have started,
and you should not be shocked

42:06.041 --> 42:14.953
if you see Me sitting on your bed and
putting My hand on your head.

42:31.537 --> 42:38.459
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ
walking into your room,

42:42.434 --> 42:45.561
or as Shri Rama.

42:46.857 --> 42:52.949
That has to happen, so you should be
prepared.

43:00.161 --> 43:07.115
Already so many miracles have taken place
on you, but on a grosser level.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.467
We have seen the light coming on My head,

43:14.668 --> 43:19.308
and the photographs have shown some
miracles to you.

43:26.749 --> 43:34.153
But many things will happen, that you will
see something that you could never imagine.

43:41.417 --> 43:48.475
This has to happen, just to convince you
that you have reached a certain height

43:48.676 --> 43:57.142
of your evolution in the new area
of Pragnya Loka.

44:05.749 --> 44:10.145
Because this is a new state into which
now you will be entering,

44:10.346 --> 44:13.639
on a horizontal basis.

44:20.589 --> 44:29.853
In this area you will give up asking for
gross things,

44:36.149 --> 44:45.549
and also for anything subtler, anything
that is subtle.

44:49.361 --> 44:52.924
The asking will disappear,

44:53.734 --> 44:58.994
and that is the time you’ll become very
powerful.

45:03.489 --> 45:08.094
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

45:11.069 --> 45:21.650
only thing, I cannot command you
to be evolved.

45:28.869 --> 45:39.415
The Kundalini's work in you has been done,
quite a lot.

45:44.137 --> 45:50.914
Now the new work of compassion,
of spreading it to others

45:51.115 --> 45:55.826
has to be done by you.

46:08.109 --> 46:11.509
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

46:11.709 --> 46:18.458
the area it covers becomes bigger
and bigger.

46:26.829 --> 46:31.690
So you become the giver of compassion.

46:35.577 --> 46:39.028
In My last lecture, which you have heard
already,

46:39.229 --> 46:44.339
I have requested you how to do tapah
(penitence).

46:44.607 --> 46:46.782
Yogi: We could not hear it, Shri Mataji.

46:46.983 --> 46:50.597
Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.

47:01.001 --> 47:05.659
With a complete surrendered mind

47:05.860 --> 47:14.515
you have to go through the pilgrimage, say,
of this castle.

47:30.457 --> 47:34.580
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah
that you have to do,

47:34.781 --> 47:42.397
because I am told some of you had
to get into little difficulties,

47:42.587 --> 47:49.433
and you people suffered a little bit
on your way for the pilgrimage.

47:57.481 --> 48:08.072
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get
into places

48:08.273 --> 48:14.718
where the devils dare not go.
Yogi: (Mais)... it is fun.

48:15.171 --> 48:17.229
Fun: no word!
Yogi: No word in French.

48:17.429 --> 48:20.689
They have never fun!

48:20.890 --> 48:24.442
Let us see, it is miserable!

48:37.664 --> 48:45.045
And if you know how to get fun out
of the so-called discomforts,

48:45.246 --> 48:49.972
then you should know you are on the right
lines.

49:01.589 --> 49:06.629
And as you start becoming discreet
automatically,

49:06.829 --> 49:11.055
you should know you are progressing well.

49:17.029 --> 49:21.785
As you become more peaceful and your temper
vanishes in the thin air

49:21.986 --> 49:30.309
as soon as you see somebody attacking you,
then know that you are progressing well.

49:48.841 --> 49:59.467
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity
falling on the personality

49:59.668 --> 50:06.508
and you do not get worried about it, then
know that you are progressing.

50:15.217 --> 50:17.676
No amount ….

50:20.053 --> 50:30.720
When no amount of artificiality can impress
you, then know that you are progressing.

50:38.589 --> 50:47.389
No amount of material well-being in others

50:47.589 --> 50:57.271
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,
then know that you are progressing well.

51:06.401 --> 51:11.752
No amount of

51:17.032 --> 51:28.611
labor or - or troubles are sufficient

51:29.783 --> 51:36.670
to become a Sahaja yogi. Any – whatever you
may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

51:36.871 --> 51:42.803
while you have got it without any effort.

51:43.004 --> 51:47.029
So you are something special.

51:55.984 --> 52:04.189
So this, once you understand that you are
special, you will become humble about it.

52:09.641 --> 52:15.266
Then when it happens to you that you’ve
humbled down

52:15.467 --> 52:20.303
when you see you have achieved something,
that you have some powers,

52:20.504 --> 52:26.409
that you are emitting innocence, that
you are discreet,

52:26.610 --> 52:30.967
and as a result of that you become more
compassion,

52:31.168 --> 52:35.229
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

52:35.429 --> 52:43.587
then you should believe that you are
in the heart of your Mother.

53:02.208 --> 53:10.780
This is what is the sign of the new
Sahaja yogi now in the new Era,

53:10.981 --> 53:18.989
who has to move with new force.

53:30.069 --> 53:39.676
Where you will grow so fast that without
meditation, you will be in meditation;

53:44.809 --> 53:50.255
without being in My presence, you will be
in My presence;

53:58.697 --> 54:06.584
without asking, you will be blessed
by your Father.

54:10.246 --> 54:19.348
This is what you are in for; and again
I welcome you to this new Era today,

54:19.617 --> 54:23.589
on this great day of Sahasrara.

54:33.869 --> 54:37.378
May God bless you all.
