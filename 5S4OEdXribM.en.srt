00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:07,336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

2
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:13,192
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

3
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:17,211
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

4
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:20,437
I don’t know what to say.

5
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:26,660
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,598
because most of you come from a culture

7
00:00:31,758 --> 00:00:35,528
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

8
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:39,626
They never realised how important it was that,

9
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,975
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

10
00:00:45,648 --> 00:00:50,719
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

11
00:00:53,063 --> 00:01:00,930
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

12
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:06,594
And also the desire to know the Divine

13
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:18,508
vanishes also in the thin air

14
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:25,063
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

15
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:30,531
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

16
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:39,859
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

17
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:44,930
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

18
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:53,890
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

19
00:01:55,296 --> 00:02:00,161
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

20
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:14,508
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

21
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:20,453
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

22
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,972
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

23
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:33,059
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

24
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,731
and entertained us the most.

25
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:39,168
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

26
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:44,154
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

27
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:48,055
and they think that you are laughing at them.

28
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:59,227
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

29
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,777
was more than what one would expect

30
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:11,047
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

31
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:17,071
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

32
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,528
that made us so happy.

33
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:26,165
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

34
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:33,130
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

35
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:38,993
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

36
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:43,075
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

37
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:49,571
His manifestation within you is so evident.

38
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:54,911
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

39
00:03:55,356 --> 00:03:57,903
so very different from other people.

40
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:02,364
One day I was travelling from London

41
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,750
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

42
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,133
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

43
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:22,035
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

44
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:27,586
I asked her, “Who are you?”

45
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:31,617
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

46
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:37,399
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

47
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,434
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

48
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,934
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

49
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:53,352
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

50
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:56,707
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,356
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

52
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:10,379
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

53
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:13,532
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

54
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:18,625
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

55
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,551
He’s not talked about the source.

56
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:28,075
I said, “Better find out,

57
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:33,000
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

58
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,860
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

59
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,981
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

60
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:50,762
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

61
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,735
and not by the Father.

62
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:55,829
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

63
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:01,250
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

64
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,696
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

65
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:16,465
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

66
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,543
also about the Jews.

67
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,977
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

68
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,535
nor about Shri Ganesh.

69
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:39,704
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

70
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:47,524
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

71
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:53,325
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

72
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,961
So now, when we deal with our children,

73
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:07,008
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

74
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:11,449
they are very innocent, very simple;

75
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:17,469
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

76
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,324
and they lose their moorings.

77
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:31,196
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

78
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:36,262
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

79
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,997
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

80
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:49,137
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

81
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:56,391
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

82
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,848
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

83
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:04,277
But you should know He is on every chakra.

84
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:14,844
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

85
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:17,277
specially the spiritual one.

86
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:22,801
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

87
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:28,856
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

88
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:36,387
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

89
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:46,145
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

90
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:54,853
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

91
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:56,707
It was Sahaj.

92
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:03,836
The life before Self-realisation was different.

93
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:06,351
You got your transformation

94
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:16,402
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

95
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:19,938
But here now we have to see

96
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:25,188
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

97
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:30,127
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

98
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:38,508
you have to cure people, you have to love them

99
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:41,274
and you have to be compassionate

100
00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:49,235
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

101
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:54,040
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

102
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:03,647
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

103
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,537
You can project it to others.

104
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:14,849
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

105
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:21,873
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

106
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,031
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

107
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:31,851
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

108
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:35,382
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

109
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:40,039
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

110
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,140
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

111
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,484
This is what you have to practise,

112
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:52,058
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

113
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:57,811
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

114
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:01,367
Now, for example, say

115
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:11,411
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

116
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:15,328
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

117
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:21,031
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

118
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:25,425
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

119
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:34,644
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

120
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:42,765
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

121
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:49,495
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

122
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,496
Not very difficult.

123
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:57,625
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

124
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:03,590
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

125
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,914
The energy will diminish.

126
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:16,027
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

127
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:22,975
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

128
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,459
you are not ordinary people

129
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:30,932
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

130
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:40,678
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

131
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:44,330
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

132
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:49,451
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

133
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:55,507
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

134
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,943
or how to deliberately do this.

135
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:02,178
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

136
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:05,795
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

137
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:18,131
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

138
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:22,338
but just your majestic personality.

139
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:27,197
This personality is here now, you see,

140
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:31,837
is sitting in such a majestic manner

141
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:39,123
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

142
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:48,588
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

143
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,717
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

144
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,080
I don’t think is alright.

145
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:04,654
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

146
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:08,181
so much ego, so much conditioning.

147
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:15,998
But something within you can rise above others

148
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:26,580
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

149
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,248
where you stand with yourself.

150
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:33,185
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

151
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:37,990
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

152
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:46,197
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

153
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:51,464
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

154
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:58,233
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

155
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,844
But the innocence that you have,

156
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,871
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

157
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:15,093
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

158
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:19,061
you are not properly dressed up

159
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:22,597
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

160
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:25,863
that they expect every other person to be.

161
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:29,057
It’s a funny thing that in this world

162
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:32,566
all human beings expect others to be very good.

163
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:35,043
Everybody should be a hero or something

164
00:15:35,203 --> 00:15:37,894
– what about themselves they never think!

165
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:41,246
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

166
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:45,309
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

167
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:50,926
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

168
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:55,777
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

169
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:58,980
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

170
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,598
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

171
00:16:04,758 --> 00:16:10,863
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

172
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:12,992
as a child does.

173
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:19,121
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

174
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:23,473
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

175
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:29,402
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

176
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:33,949
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

177
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:42,554
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

178
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:48,465
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

179
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,609
the whole world get worried about it,

180
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:56,707
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

181
00:16:56,867 --> 00:17:03,043
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

182
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:07,191
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

183
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:11,434
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

184
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:17,340
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

185
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,934
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

186
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:26,461
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

187
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:35,238
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

188
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:37,757
but just spontaneously.

189
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:45,840
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

190
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,738
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

191
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:52,738
You can’t run away from the society.

192
00:17:52,898 --> 00:18:00,789
You start getting all the rapport with such people

193
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:05,536
who are talking about things

194
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:09,691
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

195
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:13,859
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

196
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:19,098
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

197
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:25,102
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

198
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:33,871
In the sense that – when I was in London

199
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:38,465
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

200
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,465
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

201
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,593
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

202
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:48,348
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

203
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,473
all the married women have to wear this.

204
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:56,957
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

205
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,699
So I said that,

206
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:03,215
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

207
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,668
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

208
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:13,078
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

209
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:19,012
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

210
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:24,277
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

211
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:28,976
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

212
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:32,785
For the innocence, I think

213
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:38,015
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

214
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:44,301
And that’s how it is a society, today,

215
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:50,746
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

216
00:19:50,906 --> 00:19:52,762
Every individual is separate,

217
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:57,176
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

218
00:19:57,336 --> 00:20:03,543
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

219
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,957
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

220
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:11,402
or greed behind the whole thing.

221
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:17,059
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

222
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:22,598
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

223
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:26,113
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

224
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:31,117
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

225
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:37,105
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

226
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:40,590
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

227
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,480
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

228
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,324
“What will they misunderstand?”

229
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:49,551
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

230
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:52,387
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

231
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:56,113
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

232
00:20:56,273 --> 00:21:00,652
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

233
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:05,551
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

234
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:08,113
But then I noticed it’s too much

235
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:12,176
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

236
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:15,324
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

237
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:19,144
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

238
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:22,613
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

239
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:32,285
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

240
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:39,828
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

241
00:21:40,078 --> 00:21:44,980
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

242
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,207
I just can’t understand how they accept.

243
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:52,937
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

244
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,957
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

245
00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:01,613
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

246
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:06,371
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

247
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:12,199
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

248
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,629
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

249
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,859
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

250
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:27,783
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

251
00:22:27,943 --> 00:22:30,112
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

252
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:33,566
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

253
00:22:33,726 --> 00:22:38,012
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

254
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:41,202
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

255
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:46,077
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

256
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:51,703
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

257
00:22:51,863 --> 00:22:55,871
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

258
00:22:56,031 --> 00:23:04,124
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

259
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:08,191
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

260
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:14,204
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

261
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:18,168
but every time you see something you find

262
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:22,832
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

263
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:26,559
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

264
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:33,867
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

265
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:40,145
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

266
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:42,309
I don’t understand.

267
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:46,551
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

268
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:49,996
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

269
00:23:50,156 --> 00:23:52,176
“So what? What’s wrong?”

270
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:56,121
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

271
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:59,926
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

272
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:05,355
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

273
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:10,441
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

274
00:24:10,601 --> 00:24:16,746
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

275
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:21,707
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

276
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:27,305
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

277
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,965
you should be very careful,

278
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,901
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

279
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:37,211
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

280
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:47,254
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

281
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:53,641
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

282
00:24:56,172 --> 00:25:00,434
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

283
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:07,828
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

284
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:13,980
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

285
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,066
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

286
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:22,590
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

287
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,488
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

288
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:32,644
how He has made their attention so beautiful

289
00:25:32,804 --> 00:25:36,980
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

290
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,476
all the innocent things of the world.”

291
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:45,535
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

292
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:48,895
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

293
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,621
There are many who are struggling

294
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:56,098
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

295
00:25:56,258 --> 00:26:00,147
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

296
00:26:00,306 --> 00:26:03,854
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

297
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:07,301
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

298
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:12,039
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

299
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:17,934
That shows that there are so many people still

300
00:26:18,094 --> 00:26:23,629
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

301
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,388
and they want to enjoy it.

302
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:28,887
But a society has to be created of that kind.

303
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:34,277
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

304
00:26:34,437 --> 00:26:41,648
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

305
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,865
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

306
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,932
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

307
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:53,020
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

308
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,961
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

309
00:26:57,469 --> 00:27:01,746
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

310
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:06,465
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

311
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,340
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

312
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,059
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

313
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,879
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

314
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,251
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

315
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:26,496
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

316
00:27:26,656 --> 00:27:29,012
And one of them then turned around and said,

317
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:32,613
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

318
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:34,855
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

319
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:37,684
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

320
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:42,973
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

321
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:46,809
you have to project now, to project towards others.

322
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:50,707
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

323
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:53,699
just with one glance you can put that person right,

324
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:59,199
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

325
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,500
In a way that’s a projection.

326
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:07,387
Around your society, around where you are working,

327
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:12,691
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

328
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:16,020
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

329
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:21,855
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

330
00:28:22,015 --> 00:28:25,699
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

331
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:29,855
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

332
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:33,121
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

333
00:28:33,281 --> 00:28:37,066
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

334
00:28:37,226 --> 00:28:41,582
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

335
00:28:41,742 --> 00:28:45,348
You have those qualities within you

336
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:48,824
because potentially you had them before

337
00:28:48,984 --> 00:28:53,223
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

338
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:57,352
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

339
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:04,746
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

340
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:08,996
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

341
00:29:09,156 --> 00:29:13,816
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

342
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:17,551
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

343
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:21,387
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

344
00:29:21,547 --> 00:29:27,371
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

345
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:31,152
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

346
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:36,348
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

347
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,977
It is not a coincidence we should say.

348
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:45,902
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

349
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:49,488
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

350
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:53,191
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

351
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,455
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

352
00:29:56,615 --> 00:30:00,195
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

353
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:04,347
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

354
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:06,809
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

355
00:30:06,969 --> 00:30:10,110
He put them under the seat and did all that.

356
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:17,105
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

357
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:21,038
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

358
00:30:22,515 --> 00:30:26,496
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

359
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:29,220
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

360
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,090
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

361
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,105
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

362
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:39,551
You see, it is the power that you have.

363
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:44,531
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

364
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:52,101
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

365
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:56,039
You see, how children understand love.

366
00:30:56,374 --> 00:31:01,952
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

367
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:07,890
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

368
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:13,129
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

369
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:17,840
and they were very troublesome to begin with

370
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,787
and the parents were worried about them.

371
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:23,289
They sent them to Dharamsala

372
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,324
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

373
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:31,996
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

374
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,707
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

375
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:39,684
they came back and the parents asked them,

376
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,622
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

377
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:45,772
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

378
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:48,793
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

379
00:31:48,953 --> 00:31:54,836
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

380
00:31:56,117 --> 00:31:58,834
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

381
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:03,699
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

382
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:07,230
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

383
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,598
We are not bothered.”

384
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:11,637
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

385
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,059
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

386
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:16,770
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

387
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,809
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

388
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:24,934
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

389
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:28,927
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

390
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:34,235
Very much satisfied, dignified.

391
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:39,622
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

392
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:42,543
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

393
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:45,445
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

394
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:48,228
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

395
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:52,957
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

396
00:32:53,117 --> 00:32:56,594
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

397
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:59,504
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

398
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:03,286
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

399
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:11,256
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

400
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:14,965
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

401
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,325
but I have not been with them for a long time,

402
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:19,835
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

403
00:33:19,995 --> 00:33:24,313
but look at the love that they have.

404
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,825
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

405
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:30,903
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

406
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:33,114
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

407
00:33:33,274 --> 00:33:36,356
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

408
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:40,926
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

409
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:47,700
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

410
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,997
and so much they admire, they want it.

411
00:33:54,157 --> 00:34:00,082
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

412
00:34:00,242 --> 00:34:05,060
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

413
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,187
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

414
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:12,676
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

415
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:16,840
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

416
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,689
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

417
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,661
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

418
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:27,532
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

419
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:31,918
and we enjoyed all that very much.

420
00:34:32,078 --> 00:34:38,594
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

421
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:45,559
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

422
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:50,571
creating something sweet of this kind.

423
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:55,676
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

424
00:34:55,836 --> 00:35:02,848
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

425
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:07,786
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

426
00:35:07,946 --> 00:35:11,371
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

427
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:14,575
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

428
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:17,293
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

429
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:21,582
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

430
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:26,606
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

431
00:35:26,766 --> 00:35:31,161
so they got equipped from within.

432
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:35,887
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

433
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:39,770
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

434
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:47,254
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

435
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:50,184
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

436
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:53,434
also know that we have to give it to others.

437
00:35:53,594 --> 00:35:57,957
We have to pour this into others.

438
00:35:58,117 --> 00:36:01,442
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

439
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:05,395
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

440
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:10,723
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

441
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:15,668
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

442
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:19,934
And Shiva had to cut His head

443
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:24,582
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

444
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:30,604
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

445
00:36:30,764 --> 00:36:34,786
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

446
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:39,395
because in innocence you become a person

447
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:42,965
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

448
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:47,263
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

449
00:36:47,423 --> 00:36:53,032
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

450
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:59,645
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

451
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:01,215
There was a king in China.

452
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:05,036
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

453
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:15,536
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

454
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:19,969
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

455
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:23,926
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

456
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:29,059
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

457
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,161
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

458
00:37:31,321 --> 00:37:37,200
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

459
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,952
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

460
00:37:42,112 --> 00:37:44,788
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

461
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:48,788
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

462
00:37:48,948 --> 00:37:52,522
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

463
00:37:52,682 --> 00:38:00,627
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

464
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:04,065
So all the cocks were together.

465
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:08,811
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

466
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:12,194
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

467
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:15,424
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

468
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,686
he was just standing straight.

469
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:22,350
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

470
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,671
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

471
00:38:27,831 --> 00:38:31,999
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

472
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,678
where they were having these fights.

473
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,151
And this was the only cock which stood up.

474
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:46,014
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

475
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:50,686
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

476
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:55,052
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

477
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:58,437
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

478
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:02,897
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

479
00:39:03,057 --> 00:39:07,639
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

480
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:13,401
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

481
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:22,995
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

482
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:26,218
if you take to your innocence.

483
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:31,542
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

484
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:37,085
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

485
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,049
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

486
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:43,448
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

487
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:46,307
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

488
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,581
It rained so much so that they said,

489
00:39:48,741 --> 00:39:53,635
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

490
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:56,032
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

491
00:39:56,192 --> 00:40:01,666
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

492
00:40:01,826 --> 00:40:07,866
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

493
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:15,393
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

494
00:40:15,553 --> 00:40:20,686
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

495
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:24,698
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

496
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:30,221
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

497
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:36,304
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

498
00:40:36,464 --> 00:40:41,548
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

499
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:46,596
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

500
00:40:46,756 --> 00:41:00,351
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

501
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:02,845
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

502
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:08,002
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

503
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:14,745
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

504
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:21,016
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

505
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:24,758
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

506
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:28,555
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

507
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:33,547
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

508
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:38,031
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

509
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:43,305
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

510
00:41:43,465 --> 00:41:46,594
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

511
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:51,203
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

512
00:41:51,363 --> 00:41:58,910
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

513
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:02,662
How He guides you and how He helps you.

514
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:05,067
How He takes you to [the] right path.

515
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,676
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

516
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:13,051
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

517
00:42:13,211 --> 00:42:17,645
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

518
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:22,770
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

519
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:27,137
He takes you to the righteous road.

520
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:31,332
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

521
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:34,043
You always meet friends here and there.

522
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:36,457
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

523
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:39,059
And that is how He works.

524
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:48,793
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

525
00:42:48,953 --> 00:42:51,434
because you are His ganas.

526
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:54,477
But the ganas have to work!

527
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:01,218
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

528
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:09,863
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

529
00:43:10,023 --> 00:43:15,973
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

530
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:19,043
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

531
00:43:19,203 --> 00:43:22,504
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

532
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:25,578
He gives you all the good time.

533
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:28,942
Then what are we doing about it?

534
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:34,270
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

535
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,032
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

536
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:42,457
What can we do as antibodies?

537
00:43:42,617 --> 00:43:54,369
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

538
00:43:54,971 --> 00:44:01,392
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

539
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:08,014
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

540
00:44:08,174 --> 00:44:10,600
You may melt away many people.

541
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,772
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

542
00:44:17,932 --> 00:44:22,584
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

543
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:26,340
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

544
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:31,199
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

545
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,058
Because you are so powerful.

546
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:37,310
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

547
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:42,748
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

548
00:44:42,908 --> 00:44:46,178
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

549
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:50,342
And all that works out so well.

550
00:44:50,502 --> 00:44:54,022
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

551
00:44:54,182 --> 00:45:00,038
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

552
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,221
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

553
00:45:03,478 --> 00:45:08,366
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

554
00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:11,526
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

555
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:16,327
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

556
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:20,151
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

557
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:24,780
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

558
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,319
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

559
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:31,116
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

560
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:35,991
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

561
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:41,355
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

562
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:45,663
But you are not to feel any strain.

563
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:50,069
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

564
00:45:50,229 --> 00:45:52,999
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

565
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:55,444
– confidence and faith in yourself.

566
00:45:55,604 --> 00:46:00,561
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

567
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:04,455
which is nothing but compassion and love.

568
00:46:05,658 --> 00:46:07,538
If you have that faith

569
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:13,034
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

570
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:22,612
of having [a] relationship with others.

571
00:46:24,276 --> 00:46:31,760
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

572
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,291
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

573
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:41,155
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

574
00:46:41,315 --> 00:46:44,538
I have never got into a fury or a temper

575
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,881
because I think I can manage without it.

576
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:50,905
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

577
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:55,983
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

578
00:46:56,143 --> 00:47:00,569
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

579
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:03,491
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

580
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:06,834
it is such an energy-giving thing,

581
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:16,494
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

582
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:20,522
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

583
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:26,772
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

584
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:31,553
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

585
00:47:31,713 --> 00:47:35,639
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

586
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,666
that you can’t leave.

587
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:43,913
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

588
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:46,096
they don’t know how the child is lost.

589
00:47:46,256 --> 00:47:52,531
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

590
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:57,967
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

591
00:47:58,127 --> 00:48:00,819
But when they are young, they are innocent

592
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:05,467
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

593
00:48:05,627 --> 00:48:11,006
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

594
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:15,186
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

595
00:48:15,346 --> 00:48:21,826
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

596
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:26,404
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

597
00:48:26,564 --> 00:48:30,233
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

598
00:48:30,393 --> 00:48:36,358
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

599
00:48:36,518 --> 00:48:39,553
that your children are looked after.

600
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:42,928
But you are also a child of your Mother.

601
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:47,444
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

602
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:53,834
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

603
00:48:53,994 --> 00:48:57,436
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

604
00:48:57,596 --> 00:49:02,397
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

605
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,420
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

606
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,936
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

607
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:09,951
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

608
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:13,595
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

609
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:22,158
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

610
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,069
Today is to celebrate His birth

611
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:32,655
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

612
00:49:32,815 --> 00:49:38,682
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

613
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:44,116
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

614
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:50,745
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

615
00:49:51,393 --> 00:49:54,659
And that’s why He was first created.

616
00:49:55,409 --> 00:50:00,522
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

617
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:04,073
so that He can look after all the people

618
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:12,112
who are going to come from ages to ages,

619
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:17,097
to guide them always on the right path.

620
00:50:17,283 --> 00:50:22,038
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

621
00:50:22,198 --> 00:50:26,366
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

622
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:29,077
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

623
00:50:29,237 --> 00:50:31,186
That I should have not done.”

624
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:36,678
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

625
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:40,022
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

626
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:43,514
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

627
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:47,444
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

628
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:51,303
“Why did you give up your land?”

629
00:50:51,463 --> 00:50:55,514
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

630
00:50:55,674 --> 00:50:59,996
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

631
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:04,179
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

632
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,256
So I thought it’s better to give up.

633
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:08,827
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

634
00:51:08,987 --> 00:51:13,182
And he so innocently was telling me that,

635
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:19,389
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

636
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,491
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

637
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:26,889
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

638
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:28,895
But I said, “What about your brother?”

639
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:32,541
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

640
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:35,631
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

641
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:40,014
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

642
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:43,170
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

643
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,999
Later on I might become a bad man.”

644
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,810
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

645
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,522
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

646
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:57,240
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

647
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,749
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

648
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:03,327
I don’t know what to do.

649
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,663
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

650
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:12,636
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

651
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:16,100
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

652
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,264
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

653
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:24,569
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

654
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:30,584
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

655
00:52:30,744 --> 00:52:34,280
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

656
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,647
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

657
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:41,491
So he can save me from the smoking.”

658
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:46,014
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

659
00:52:46,174 --> 00:52:48,889
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

660
00:52:49,049 --> 00:52:52,444
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

661
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:57,100
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

662
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:01,725
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

663
00:53:01,885 --> 00:53:06,342
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

664
00:53:06,502 --> 00:53:10,599
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

665
00:53:10,759 --> 00:53:15,987
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

666
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:21,530
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

667
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,319
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

668
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:31,952
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

669
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:37,670
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

670
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:41,491
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

671
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,639
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

672
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:49,155
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

673
00:53:49,315 --> 00:53:53,616
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

674
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:56,600
For example, I have never seen such honest people

675
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,420
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

676
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,202
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

677
00:54:04,362 --> 00:54:07,233
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

678
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:10,155
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

679
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:13,905
but most of you have become so honest.

680
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:16,764
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

681
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:20,776
and to see people who are so honest.

682
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:24,722
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

683
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:29,600
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

684
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,557
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

685
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:41,381
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

686
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:45,947
how you people are so much fond of me.

687
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:57,530
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

688
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,733
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

689
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:04,264
and that is Shri Ganesha’s, again, the quality.

690
00:55:04,424 --> 00:55:06,420
Because He’s so attached to me

691
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,327
that he will fight his Father, he will fight everybody.

692
00:55:10,487 --> 00:55:12,249
That’s what you are.

693
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,592
Anything against me, you cannot tolerate,

694
00:55:14,752 --> 00:55:18,608
anything wrong said against me you cannot follow.

695
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:23,459
I have seen people getting furious if somebody said a word against me.

696
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:30,225
So this quality of love for me is coming from Shri Ganesha within you.

697
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:33,334
But the another quality, as I said, is that

698
00:55:33,494 --> 00:55:38,256
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

699
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:43,983
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

700
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:50,780
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

701
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:58,334
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

702
00:55:58,494 --> 00:56:01,809
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

703
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:05,499
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

704
00:56:05,659 --> 00:56:10,913
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

705
00:56:11,073 --> 00:56:16,108
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

706
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:18,514
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

707
00:56:18,674 --> 00:56:22,405
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

708
00:56:22,565 --> 00:56:28,303
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

709
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:32,350
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

710
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,631
Nobody makes a mistake.”

711
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:38,194
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

712
00:56:38,354 --> 00:56:42,686
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

713
00:56:42,846 --> 00:56:46,846
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

714
00:56:47,007 --> 00:56:51,124
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

715
00:56:51,284 --> 00:56:56,280
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

716
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,319
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

717
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:04,905
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

718
00:57:05,065 --> 00:57:12,608
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

719
00:57:12,768 --> 00:57:24,096
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

720
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:29,334
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

721
00:57:29,494 --> 00:57:34,194
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

722
00:57:34,354 --> 00:57:37,905
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

723
00:57:38,065 --> 00:57:40,490
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

724
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,959
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

725
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:50,866
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

726
00:57:51,026 --> 00:57:56,772
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

727
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:04,413
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

728
00:58:04,573 --> 00:58:09,319
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

729
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:17,053
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

730
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:23,764
with such speed and with such lightness:

731
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:26,350
they were lifting their legs and hand.

732
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:31,885
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

733
00:58:32,994 --> 00:58:38,092
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

734
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:42,170
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

735
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:46,084
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

736
00:58:46,244 --> 00:58:48,959
They earn their living, they are farmers,

737
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:54,069
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

738
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:58,022
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

739
00:58:58,182 --> 00:59:06,381
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

740
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:09,663
or another bad things that people think

741
00:59:09,823 --> 00:59:13,267
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

742
00:59:13,427 --> 00:59:16,513
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

743
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:22,256
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

744
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,397
in a very beautiful manner.

745
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:30,444
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

746
00:59:30,604 --> 00:59:33,788
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

747
00:59:33,948 --> 00:59:39,788
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

748
00:59:39,948 --> 00:59:46,092
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

749
00:59:46,252 --> 00:59:51,444
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

750
00:59:51,604 --> 00:59:54,178
and think of violence and killing people?

751
00:59:54,338 --> 00:59:56,975
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

752
00:59:57,135 --> 01:00:00,983
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

753
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:05,999
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

754
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:12,491
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

755
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:16,725
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

756
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:22,639
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

757
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,920
There is no need for us to fight.

758
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,475
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

759
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:33,256
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

760
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:36,436
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

761
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:39,147
He’ll either become a transformed person

762
01:00:39,307 --> 01:00:43,323
or he will not be there to trouble you.

763
01:00:44,158 --> 01:00:49,280
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

764
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,682
and our powers.

765
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:57,483
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

766
01:00:57,643 --> 01:01:02,666
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

767
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:07,561
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

768
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:11,221
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

769
01:01:11,494 --> 01:01:13,009
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

770
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,372
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

771
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:18,592
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

772
01:01:18,752 --> 01:01:21,600
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

773
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,991
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

774
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:32,920
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

775
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,428
You can do it, everything. You can.

776
01:01:35,588 --> 01:01:39,819
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

777
01:01:39,979 --> 01:01:44,663
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

778
01:01:44,823 --> 01:01:47,014
you are not going to spoil anybody,

779
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:52,045
but your power itself will show that this power

780
01:01:52,205 --> 01:02:00,600
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

781
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,795
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

782
01:02:03,955 --> 01:02:09,721
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

783
01:02:09,923 --> 01:02:15,311
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

784
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:22,971
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

785
01:02:23,752 --> 01:02:29,428
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

786
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:33,459
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

787
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:36,694
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

788
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:40,749
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

789
01:02:40,909 --> 01:02:44,522
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

790
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:47,584
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

791
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:50,290
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

792
01:02:50,451 --> 01:02:53,623
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

793
01:02:53,784 --> 01:02:56,874
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

794
01:02:57,034 --> 01:03:00,600
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

795
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,803
and they are sitting there and fighting,

796
01:03:02,963 --> 01:03:06,639
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

797
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,943
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

798
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:14,116
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

799
01:03:14,276 --> 01:03:15,850
So there were four tiers.

800
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:19,850
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

801
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,209
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

802
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:27,314
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

803
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:31,819
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

804
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:39,807
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

805
01:03:40,673 --> 01:03:46,577
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

806
01:03:46,737 --> 01:03:52,010
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

807
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:55,288
He’s the one who worked it out.

808
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:56,850
That’s why they say always,

809
01:03:57,010 --> 01:04:00,764
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

810
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:03,725
because then it gives you that peace,

811
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:09,436
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

812
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,729
that you never thought it would.

813
01:04:15,744 --> 01:04:20,342
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

814
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:25,264
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

815
01:04:25,424 --> 01:04:28,428
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

816
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:30,803
We are still hoping to get the land

817
01:04:30,963 --> 01:04:34,210
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

818
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,944
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

819
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:41,225
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

820
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:45,326
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

821
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:51,471
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

822
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:56,045
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

823
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:59,405
But all that has worked out so well and now

824
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:03,280
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

825
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,519
May God Bless you.
