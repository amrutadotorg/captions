1
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:23,463
Today we have assembled here to celebrate
the birth of Christ.

2
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:33,292
When you think of His birth one knows that
He was born in a very humble place

3
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:39,850
and all His life He lived in a very humble
way.

4
00:00:42,095 --> 00:00:50,276
Also, as Sahaja yogis, you know that He was
the incarnation of Shri Ganesha

5
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:57,449
which is, in essence, is innocence and He
was

6
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:10,062
crucified due to the stupid understanding
of blind people.

7
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:19,563
He was the eternal child and it’s so sad
that

8
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:31,488
when we talk about Christ and Christianity

9
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:36,540
we feel that Christianity has gone just
the other way around,

10
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:40,719
on the other side of Christ.

11
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,940
If one is construction, the another is
destruction

12
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,021
and if one is innocence, another is cunning.

13
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:58,905
If you see the Christian nations, it's very
surprising where we have got Christianity

14
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:07,072
in its practice; it's very surprising that
innocence has no place, no respect,

15
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:16,080
chastity has no place, no respect, which
was the essence of Christ,

16
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:20,280
He was made of it.

17
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:30,014
It is sometimes shocking how these so-called
Christian nations

18
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:34,151
have maligned Christ to that extent

19
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:41,524
and how they have ruined so many people
with their stupid ideas

20
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:48,788
of allowing people to indulge into all kinds
of filthy things.

21
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:55,017
And the second point is very important,
to see how

22
00:02:55,218 --> 00:03:00,188
He was born in a very humble abode,

23
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,381
He lived in a very humble way.

24
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:10,644
He was a son of a carpenter so He lived
like a carpenter,

25
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:21,306
but in the Western life people are so
materialistic

26
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:27,590
and to them to live lavishly, to show off
their wealth

27
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:32,991
and to plunder people, plunder countries
after countries

28
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:37,843
for material gain is a common thing.

29
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:46,294
They do not feel also that it is wrong and
they are quite proud of it.

30
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:52,148
And the third great thing about Christ was
that

31
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,942
He wanted people to love each other and
to be humble,

32
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:07,425
but the arrogance and the cruelty that one
has seen of the Christian nations

33
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:14,846
one cannot understand how are they anywhere
near Christ.

34
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:21,647
He has said about, "Blessed are those who
are meek".

35
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:27,566
Where are those meek people living? Not
in the western countries,

36
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:32,967
not in the countries where Christ is
worshipped, where temples are raised,

37
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:41,261
are raised in His honor and have been
worshipping the Mother for so many years.

38
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:46,865
What a sinful thing it is to do to Christ.

39
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:53,667
Is the greatest sin that we say that we are
following Christ

40
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:57,126
and to do all these horrible things,

41
00:04:57,308 --> 00:05:03,222
all such people have to go to hell
of the worst type, no doubt about it.

42
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:07,000
They may not realize but they are already
getting into it,

43
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,515
they are already having this problem.

44
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:16,259
They are worse than people who crucified
Christ, this is every-day crucifixion.

45
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,938
So it's a great occasion today to celebrate

46
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,184
the birth of Christ, who came on this earth
to help us in our resurrection,

47
00:05:28,385 --> 00:05:32,218
to talk about the Holy Ghost.

48
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:38,565
He was bearing all the brunt of the people,
everything,

49
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:43,616
but the outcome of that life is so
horrifying that sometimes I get worried

50
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:48,423
that I hope they don't make something out
of Me like that.

51
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:53,901
It is such a stupid ideas people have
in the west,

52
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:59,650
that for any sensible man he can see the way

53
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:07,544
they are emotional, romantic, nonsensical.
They have no respect

54
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,787
for themselves and to follow Christ with
that kind of an attitude is, I think is,

55
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:18,984
they have no business, they have no right,
but it has happened.

56
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:25,847
Now you people are born again as Christ
has said, "You are to be born again".

57
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:31,843
You have achieved that state which Christ
was talking about.

58
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:38,697
You are the special type of people. I never
had such hopes I must say.

59
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:44,911
The first encounter was so horrible that I
didn't think that many will come out of it

60
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:48,519
but so many of you have come out of it

61
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,314
and have really glorified the name of
Christ, no doubt about it, and keep it up.

62
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,429
I would request you now to know that you
are Sahaja yogis

63
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,839
and that you are the followers of Christ.

64
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,031
You are the Gnostics as described, you are
the ones who know

65
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:12,886
and that's how you have to help people
to emancipate.

66
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:21,327
It is very surprising that I saw that
the Western life,

67
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:30,372
the stupid, destructive ideas, did not kill
the innocence.

68
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:39,153
Like the clouds, all these affectations
were there

69
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:44,306
but once the Kundalini rose the innocence
started expressing itself.

70
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:53,394
But still, I would say that this kind
of lovey-dovey stuff

71
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:59,806
must be given up. It is just most
un-Christian

72
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:05,632
because if you see His life, it was a life
of a tapasvi,

73
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:13,375
a man who lived in a very detached manner,
in nisanga.

74
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,927
So for Sahaja yogis who are coming from
Christian life

75
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:22,554
have to understand if they have to get rid
of it, they should be like that.

76
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:27,302
But on the contrary, see the interest
in marriages,

77
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:34,621
the interest in all this kind of thing and
after marriage - is a bit too much.

78
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:41,922
It is so much in it, I mean it’s absurd,
it's absurd in Sahaja Yoga.

79
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:49,612
It's one of the lifestyles, is alright, one
of the part, it's not everything;

80
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:55,405
and it covers the whole entire personality
of a Christian personality.

81
00:08:55,606 --> 00:09:01,640
Not with Muslims or Hindus, I've seen that.
I mean, I'm married too.

82
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:08,641
But it doesn't cover My whole entire being
with it. How can it?

83
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:13,505
And that's the problem is - that once
marriage system starts, anything starts,

84
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:18,803
“oh it becomes so important” and I'm faced
with problems all the time.

85
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:22,025
The marriage is performed then letters will
be coming,

86
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,967
“this has happened to my marriage”.
They must get married,

87
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:28,034
nobody is such that, supposing now one is
finished,

88
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:33,699
live without marriage, they cannot do it,
just can't live.

89
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,146
Christ never got married.

90
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:42,618
They cannot have that tapasvita in them
and they depend so much,

91
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:46,282
they'll ruin their wives, they'll ruin
their husbands, they'll ruin Sahaja Yoga.

92
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:49,218
They'll take them away - but it's something
surprising -

93
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:56,358
the importance of Sahaja Yoga is so
minimized by this Christian mind,

94
00:09:56,876 --> 00:10:02,426
[that?] I don't know from where these ideas
have come to you.

95
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:11,517
It's a juxtaposition as you can call it,
juxtaposition.

96
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:17,163
There is no similarity between the life
Christ must have thought

97
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:20,231
people would lead and the people are
leading.

98
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:26,578
So it is necessary for Sahaja yogis to have
a dignity and a sense

99
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:29,527
and to know that they are grounded
in Sahaja Yoga

100
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:37,605
and marriage and all those things are just
subsidiary. It's not the end of life.

101
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:44,427
And when I see that happening I am rather
surprised in Sahaja Yoga

102
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:50,622
I have to marry people because I believe
that one should lead a proper married life.

103
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:55,741
Because if you just take up a sanyasa
without going through this married life,

104
00:10:55,942 --> 00:11:00,122
you can be very much hypocritical.

105
00:11:00,323 --> 00:11:04,733
But that doesn't mean that marriage is
everything.

106
00:11:04,934 --> 00:11:11,700
It's not so important, it's just something
has to happen.

107
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:16,227
It's not even important than any puja;

108
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:21,973
it's not even important than praying to Me;

109
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:26,138
it's not even important than meditating;

110
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:33,189
it's not important at all than even eating
your food.

111
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:39,148
The more I know you start making of it
you fall into the same trap

112
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:42,516
from where I pulled you out.

113
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:51,073
So as I, the other day I was telling people
about what they have to do

114
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:59,312
about these caste system we have in India.
So in the society of Sahaja yogis,

115
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:05,071
it should be only a one day affair or two
day affair at the most.

116
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:11,140
But so much importance, husband, wives,
getting married,

117
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:16,719
then solving their problems, I get
a headache with them.

118
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,900
And they'll always come "my wife, you know,
she's like this,

119
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:23,898
and wife's sister like that, and wife's
this".

120
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:28,084
I mean, one should be ashamed even to say
that "my wife".

121
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:34,049
In India nobody says like that. I don't
think anybody will say "my wife".

122
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,072
It's not done. At the most they'll say
"my children's mother",

123
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:45,777
and if you have no children you don't say
anything.

124
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:55,509
So this is the doom from which you have
come out. Please try to understand.

125
00:12:56,455 --> 00:13:01,812
From hell we have come out, absolutely
wrong ideas we had,

126
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:10,453
from there we have come out, now be
dignified, be sensible.

127
00:13:11,344 --> 00:13:16,049
An over-importance to such un-important
thing

128
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,175
will not allow you to rise very high
in life.

129
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,522
But I don't say you don't marry, you must
marry.

130
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:28,656
Of course, if you have a Sahaja yogini who
is also a good Sahaja yogini and she knows

131
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:34,044
about Sahaja Yoga and then of course you
are helped much more, definitely.

132
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:41,632
You get much more power, much more
understanding, much more joy

133
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:47,529
and it's very good but the entire
relationship is so important

134
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,802
on small, small things, this is just beyond
Me to understand.

135
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:59,030
Then I see that then the girls fall in love
with the man whom they marry, finished;

136
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,731
the man is finished, the woman is finished.

137
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:10,519
Today I am taking this great occasion
to tell you

138
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,609
that Christ was born to Immaculata;

139
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:26,320
and that's how I have given you your second
birth

140
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:31,529
and you are so pure.

141
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:37,086
So all the impurities, you must see them
clearly.

142
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:44,264
I know you don't like them but they still
creep from here and there.

143
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:49,417
Of course if the society you see in the west
is a society which

144
00:14:49,618 --> 00:14:52,803
of course there is no family, no wife,
nothing of the kind,

145
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:57,647
so it's just slightly better than that -
but again you get stuck.

146
00:14:57,848 --> 00:15:02,563
If you have to come up to this stage, you
have to give up the staircase.

147
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,530
You think that you have achieved a lot
because now you have a settled family

148
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:11,463
and settled children and you are only worried
about your own children all the time.

149
00:15:11,664 --> 00:15:20,464
No, it's another temptation; it's [a] very
big temptation.

150
00:15:22,607 --> 00:15:30,977
So on the great occasion of the birth
of Christ we have to say to ourselves

151
00:15:31,178 --> 00:15:37,626
that we are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

152
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:45,196
that's the main thing, everything is
subsidiary.

153
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:52,499
I hope you'll understand that we are now

154
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,701
on the cusp of a wave from where we are
going to jump onto another wave,

155
00:15:56,902 --> 00:16:02,280
which will be much higher than this, but
you must have the worthiness.

156
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:07,269
If you are not sea-worthy you’ll be
drowned,

157
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:13,757
so we have to develop that worthiness -
and we have Christ before us.

158
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,086
What a life, what a life it was.

159
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:23,455
He lived like a human being in a humble
way and what a life.

160
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:32,684
And how truthfully forthright He was to say
everything so clearly.

161
00:16:32,885 --> 00:16:35,558
In the same way you'll have your strength

162
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,627
when you will know that you are much more
than a married man

163
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:44,957
and you are much more than your nationality.

164
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:48,564
You are a higher personality,

165
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:55,125
a Sahaja yogi who is dwelling in the bliss
of the Kingdom of God.

166
00:16:55,326 --> 00:17:02,331
That's the bliss, not the family bliss and
the children bliss, but the bliss of God.

167
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:05,629
May God bless you.
