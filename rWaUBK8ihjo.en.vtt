00:14.849 --> 00:21.657
(...) Secondly I have to tell you that
the women in the West

00:22.030 --> 00:24.952
have changed their styles,

00:25.153 --> 00:28.058
which is very, very dangerous
for their society,

00:28.259 --> 00:32.198
because they have also taken
to the egoistical ways of men.

00:32.399 --> 00:37.721
So if men have gone say ten feet
they have run after them

00:37.922 --> 00:45.203
again, about say eight feet and pulled back
men even to go further than them.

00:45.404 --> 00:49.280
Now this is completely crossing your egos,

00:49.481 --> 00:55.428
because women do not have such
possibility of egos normally.

00:55.610 --> 00:58.014
So competing men in ego what you did

00:58.215 --> 01:01.420
you have lost your complete mariadas
of a woman,

01:01.621 --> 01:06.060
there’s no mariada of a woman.
Man has a mariada of a man;

01:06.261 --> 01:09.762
if a man starts behaving like a woman,
he’s not a man.

01:09.978 --> 01:12.931
In the same way, the women, if they
start behaving like men,

01:13.132 --> 01:15.539
then they are no more women.

01:15.740 --> 01:19.073
They lost their mariadas. They’re out,
so they get possessed.

01:19.274 --> 01:25.319
And that’s why women, when they are
egoistical they become horrid,

01:25.997 --> 01:28.941
their faces become horrid, they look
horrid,

01:29.142 --> 01:31.006
their whole behavior is horrid.

01:31.207 --> 01:34.470
They can become dry like bean sticks,
you see,

01:34.634 --> 01:39.086
and could be so hard as to hit you
like an iron rod.

01:39.287 --> 01:42.614
They say, “The lady with the iron rod
in her hand.”

01:42.815 --> 01:45.914
All this happens because we have
a mariada,

01:46.115 --> 01:50.963
we are the style as we are. If it’s a rose,
it’s a rose.

01:51.164 --> 01:58.923
Be happy that you are a flower of rose.
Now the rose wants to become the thorn,

02:02.416 --> 02:06.415
so we lose all our mariadas.

02:06.616 --> 02:10.499
Today I will be speaking to you before
we start this

02:10.700 --> 02:12.963
here when the people are coming
before that,

02:13.164 --> 02:17.102
to the ladies and tell them what’s gone
wrong with them,

02:17.303 --> 02:22.077
and that is how you must know that
the plight of the West

02:22.278 --> 02:26.262
is not by men, but by women.

02:27.363 --> 02:32.144
Women have ruined the society of West,
Western society.

02:32.345 --> 02:36.040
Is the Indian women who have kept
the society intact.

02:36.241 --> 02:42.216
All My really thanks to their solid
behavior towards life.

02:42.751 --> 02:47.083
It is the women of this country
who have ruined

02:47.284 --> 02:53.645
all that was so delicate, emotional,
beautiful. Love, affection, compassion.

02:53.846 --> 02:57.613
Women are there to give joy

02:57.814 --> 03:02.178
and happiness and emotional security
to the whole society.

03:02.379 --> 03:07.025
While they take over, “Do this, give that,
do that, this.”

03:07.226 --> 03:11.140
Even the husbands have become just
like servants in the house.

03:11.341 --> 03:16.860
“You haven’t done the cleaning properly,
you haven’t cleaned the kitchen properly.”

03:17.061 --> 03:21.390
I went to England, I was surprised
all kitchen cleaning

03:21.591 --> 03:24.697
and all that is so well done in England,
you see, you have everything

03:24.898 --> 03:27.908
for cleaning this, cleaning that. I said,
“Why it has happened?”

03:28.109 --> 03:30.217
It’s the men, you see, they had to do it
so they found out

03:30.418 --> 03:33.515
all the ways and methods.

03:34.679 --> 03:39.289
Have to be sparkling all right, sparkling
you want, I’ll get you such a thing

03:39.490 --> 03:43.708
that if you put in your hand your hand
will burn, all the acids put everywhere,

03:43.909 --> 03:50.061
with a big glove in the hand put it
everywhere. And everything gets all right.

03:50.262 --> 03:57.429
Then the children, you see, suffer, because
that’s the job of a gardener,

03:57.630 --> 04:02.039
beautiful things that are born, to be
looked after with that kindness.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.111
But you over-indulge into your children
in the beginning.

04:07.312 --> 04:12.509
A mother is like a gardener, she has
to prune also;

04:13.262 --> 04:16.950
she has to cut also, so the growth
is all right.

04:17.151 --> 04:21.929
If your child is spoilt you’re no good
a mother, useless you are.

04:26.577 --> 04:30.170
But you groom your husband not your
children, just the other way round,

04:30.371 --> 04:32.507
because ego is towards your husband
all the time grooming.

04:32.708 --> 04:36.111
“Sit here, go there, what’s this?”
Money business,

04:36.312 --> 04:39.519
“Give me all the money, I keep
all the money,” everything.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.228
Now one may say that the law is such.
If the law is stupid,

04:43.429 --> 04:46.716
the Sahaja Yoginis should not take
to such a law.

04:46.917 --> 04:49.219
That law has ruined you all, I tell you.

04:49.420 --> 04:53.216
Because this is such an important part
of life,

04:53.417 --> 04:58.048
it is such an important area of life

04:59.869 --> 05:03.490
that it should not have suffered.

05:03.813 --> 05:11.529
Where affection, love, kindness, all that
is required is missing,

05:11.730 --> 05:16.422
then you become people without
any meaning. Life is aimless.

05:16.623 --> 05:21.256
You don’t know what to do, that’s why
the children commit suicide.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.871
And then the love should be such that
they should be pruned,

05:26.072 --> 05:29.360
for that you must have wisdom, which
also one does not develop, because

05:29.561 --> 05:35.072
if you run after your Mooladhara Chakra
how can you have wisdom?

05:37.608 --> 05:40.656
Here men have befooled you completely.

05:40.857 --> 05:44.845
Completely they have befooled you,
take it from Me.

05:45.089 --> 05:48.089
You must keep your wisdom intact.

05:48.290 --> 05:51.969
And not only that they have befooled you,
but they themselves have stooped down

05:52.170 --> 05:59.414
to befool you. So they have their devious
methods, they are not straightforward.

06:00.378 --> 06:03.779
So, as Sahaja Yogis we are above
all these things,

06:04.009 --> 06:07.032
we have reached the state where
we are above.

06:07.233 --> 06:11.446
We are here for correcting all those things
that have gone wrong in the society,

06:11.647 --> 06:16.367
because Sahaja Yoga faces towards
the society, not towards yourself only.

06:16.568 --> 06:19.093
So at this stage we have to understand
what we have to do is:

06:19.294 --> 06:23.113
first of all our own understanding
should be such.

06:23.314 --> 06:27.818
Even now with all this movement
of Sahaja Yoga understanding,

06:28.019 --> 06:30.958
women don’t realize that they have to be
like women.

06:31.159 --> 06:36.992
I have seen them, they still,
“What’s wrong?” Still go on,

06:37.193 --> 06:46.202
and men don’t understand that they have
to be like men, even after (...).

06:48.207 --> 06:52.835
And if they they become really like men,
women will appreciate them.

06:53.036 --> 06:59.264
And if you become really like women,
men will appreciate you.

07:00.077 --> 07:07.277
You see, it’s the opposites that attract
each other, that should be normal.

07:07.608 --> 07:10.600
But we live in abnormal way that the men
are women

07:10.801 --> 07:16.168
and the women are men. What do you
do now?

07:16.369 --> 07:21.624
So it is very important for men
to understand now -

07:21.825 --> 07:27.478
because I am going to talk to women later
on - that they should become like men.

07:27.679 --> 07:30.936
They must fix up things, they must
take decisions,

07:31.137 --> 07:33.414
they must be the one who must rule.

07:33.615 --> 07:38.757
But that’s outward, actually it’s
the source is the woman,

07:38.958 --> 07:41.637
the woman is the potential and man
is the kinetic.

07:41.838 --> 07:44.612
For example, there’s a fan moving.

07:44.813 --> 07:49.116
Movement of the fan is the kinetic force,
you can say,

07:49.317 --> 07:52.136
but the potential force that is within us

07:52.337 --> 07:56.630
is the one which is the electricity, which
is coming from the source.

07:56.831 --> 08:01.741
Which is higher, the fan that moves
or the source?

08:01.942 --> 08:05.347
Let the women decide and men understand.

08:05.548 --> 08:08.243
But if that source dries out and wants
to become the fan,

08:08.444 --> 08:13.554
no fan will work. Upside down situation.

08:14.011 --> 08:16.936
If you realize you are the source,

08:17.137 --> 08:20.645
you are the one who is going to give
all the shakti to men,

08:20.846 --> 08:24.061
you will stop behaving like men.

08:24.262 --> 08:26.477
It doesn’t mean that you cannot go
to work, you cannot do;

08:26.678 --> 08:30.320
but take to work which is more suitable
to women.

08:30.521 --> 08:34.172
Like I would not like a woman to have
a bus driver’s job

08:34.373 --> 08:39.839
or a truck driver, or wrestler.

08:45.100 --> 08:49.437
No. I’m not telling you; I’m telling
from experience.

08:50.929 --> 08:55.286
Once I was traveling, I was a student
at that time, in Lahore, you see,

08:55.487 --> 08:59.240
and I was traveling by train and at some
station, you see,

08:59.441 --> 09:02.258
the train stopped in the night

09:02.459 --> 09:07.061
and a lady came and she said,
“Open the door for me.”

09:07.262 --> 09:10.473
So I said, “But it’s so crowded, all right.
I’ll try, I’ll try.”

09:10.674 --> 09:13.422
And she said. “If You don’t open I can
break it.” I said, “How can you?”

09:13.623 --> 09:17.178
She said, “You don’t know who I am?” I
said, “Who?” She said, “I am Ahmida Bhanu.”

09:17.379 --> 09:19.768
I said, ‘Who’s Ahmida Bhanu?”
“The wrestler lady.”

09:19.969 --> 09:24.221
“Oh, baba,” I said, “Thank God.” (...).
I said, “If you’re a wrestler lady

09:24.422 --> 09:26.323
why are you coming in the ladies
department?

09:26.524 --> 09:29.923
Why don’t you go to the men’s?”

09:31.212 --> 09:34.213
And she pushed the door so violently,
she came up

09:34.414 --> 09:38.762
and I looked at her, you know I said,
“Wow, what a person!”

09:42.453 --> 09:48.033
And she sat down, you see, with her
whole countenance

09:48.234 --> 09:52.958
and everything, her gait and state
of sitting, everything was so manly.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.818
Like that she sat down and said,
“Come along now

09:55.019 --> 09:57.161
those who want to say I should not
sit here.”

09:57.362 --> 10:00.605
I said, “Nobody wants that now, Madam,
you sit comfortably.

10:00.806 --> 10:05.673
But we’ll have to get somebody from
the other compartment to have wrestling.”

10:05.874 --> 10:09.864
And then she was quiet, and she was really,

10:10.065 --> 10:15.099
I saw her all her muscles so overdeveloped
and she was really

10:15.300 --> 10:21.684
looking like I would say a Western cow,
we can say.

10:26.261 --> 10:31.545
Like the cows here look like buffalos,
not like cows.

10:32.443 --> 10:35.038
Something very funny I cannot forget that,
you see that experience,

10:35.239 --> 10:39.876
I was very young and I was really,
I didn’t know, and I felt like laughing

10:40.077 --> 10:44.582
but I couldn’t even laugh at her,
she’ll box my face.

10:47.577 --> 10:50.549
So this is what it is, that we are
ending up there,

10:50.750 --> 10:52.968
must know that, how far are we going.

10:53.169 --> 10:56.595
Are we going to become wrestlers?

10:57.721 --> 11:01.053
So this is what it is,

11:01.254 --> 11:04.507
one has to learn that it has been there
for ages,

11:04.708 --> 11:09.523
ages it has been there. I have seen,
I’ve read books,

11:09.724 --> 11:13.539
some books, old books; I’ve seen some
films also, where they’ve shown

11:13.740 --> 11:16.838
even in olden times, the women used
to have broom in their hands

11:17.039 --> 11:18.877
hitting their husband, sort of thing.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.652
We, too, have some of them blessed in India

11:21.853 --> 11:26.409
but they’re very, very few, very few
women like that.

11:26.610 --> 11:30.561
Not a big number but it may increase,
God knows, you see,

11:30.762 --> 11:35.650
so keep your fingers crossed, but I would
say that this is what is happening.

11:35.851 --> 11:39.311
So with too much ego of men which goes
into Left Vishuddhi

11:39.512 --> 11:42.454
they say, “No, let the women take over,
it’s all right,

11:42.655 --> 11:46.614
let them be satisfied. No more of their
aggression, let them have their own.”

11:46.815 --> 11:50.190
So they do what they like, men are
not bothered

11:50.391 --> 11:52.605
and they go into their left this thing,

11:52.806 --> 11:55.561
and there’s no enjoyment of marriage
or love.

11:55.762 --> 12:01.294
So now we had yesterday the other marriage
for the benefit of your children,

12:01.495 --> 12:06.540
for the goodness of them, all that, take
your roles as women and men.

12:06.741 --> 12:11.330
Your roles are as women and men
and you’ll see you’ll enjoy it.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.185
The quarrel should be on that role.

12:14.386 --> 12:17.344
The man wants to do something for you,
you should say, “No, no, no

12:17.545 --> 12:20.929
how can you do? That’s too much for me.
Let me do this work.”

12:21.130 --> 12:24.863
As I’ve told you many a times how
My husband when he gets angry

12:25.064 --> 12:28.555
he wants to wash his undershirt,
you see, to show he’s angry.

12:28.756 --> 12:34.754
Or when he’s very angry, then he will
clean the bathroom.

12:39.137 --> 12:42.643
But he does it so badly

12:44.053 --> 12:47.704
that I know that it is he has done.
I feel like laughing but I dare not

12:47.905 --> 12:51.554
because I must keep his spirit on.

12:51.755 --> 12:57.402
And then he starts talking in a very,
you see, respectable way to everyone.

12:57.603 --> 12:59.634
“Thou,” he calls everyone ‘thou,’
you see.

12:59.835 --> 13:02.932
“Thou,” he says, “Thou are like
that, thou are like that,”

13:03.133 --> 13:06.104
so I know now he is really angry
for something.

13:06.305 --> 13:09.621
But he won’t say what he is angry with,
you see.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.395
Then we have to find out what is he
angry with,

13:12.596 --> 13:16.605
and if so, don’t feel guilty, correct it.

13:17.770 --> 13:23.371
(...) Now you must find out what are the
weak points of your husband, first of all,

13:23.572 --> 13:26.836
and of your wife. On what point she gets
upset.

13:27.037 --> 13:29.195
Now the attitude should be we should not
upset her,

13:29.396 --> 13:30.646
we should not make her angry,

13:30.847 --> 13:33.484
and another attitude of the wife
the same way,

13:33.685 --> 13:35.594
much more for the husband.

13:35.795 --> 13:40.118
So now, what are the soft points on which
he really gets upset?

13:40.319 --> 13:42.917
Just study, it’s very simple,

13:43.118 --> 13:46.621
laugh at it, don’t take it seriously but
be careful to avoid that.

13:46.822 --> 13:50.330
Now also find out what makes him happy.

13:50.531 --> 13:54.085
Like if I’m really sometimes - I never get
angry, as you know that,

13:54.286 --> 13:59.197
I never get angry, but if I am showing off
My anger just …

13:59.443 --> 14:03.482
(Let it be, let it be. It’s alright.
Sit down.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.669
He understands Sahaj Yoga. Alright.)

14:08.230 --> 14:15.721
So, now how to show that, how
to neutralize an anger of a person?

14:15.922 --> 14:17.925
Say now, supposing I am trying to show,

14:18.126 --> 14:21.299
if you put a child in My lap - finished,
anger is gone.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.031
I cannot show anger with a child on My lap,
is simple.

14:25.232 --> 14:30.373
So you must find out. Like My husband,
you see, if he’s angry supposing,

14:30.574 --> 14:37.235
I know him then if I tell him that,
“What about getting Me a nice sari?”

14:37.436 --> 14:44.288
Ah, finished, then he’s very happy. Ah,
I’ve done him the greatest favor, you see.

14:44.489 --> 14:48.536
Like that, you see, you must find out
what thing pleases your husband,

14:48.737 --> 14:51.338
what thing pleases your wife, and
neutralize it.

14:51.539 --> 14:55.595
And, you see, little things like that you
must learn. This is the art of living,

14:55.796 --> 14:59.988
this is the art of living a Sahaja Yogi
life. Is the art of living it,

15:00.189 --> 15:03.912
how with little few things, you see,
how I manage.

15:04.113 --> 15:07.546
Now you must have seen how in My lecture
I say quite serious things,

15:07.747 --> 15:11.653
but in your bubbles of laughter it just
settles down in your mind,

15:11.854 --> 15:15.621
that’s how you should do it. Because humor
is one of the greatest things

15:15.822 --> 15:18.650
that puts the thing through,

15:18.851 --> 15:23.164
makes the person understand, and it
doesn’t harm anyone.

15:23.365 --> 15:27.662
That’s how things improve, and when you
see that you are settled down in peace,

15:27.863 --> 15:31.322
that’s the first thing a husband and wife
must do is to settle down in peace.

15:31.523 --> 15:35.555
Children feel all right, everyone feels
all right

15:35.756 --> 15:37.963
and then gradually let it correct.

15:38.164 --> 15:41.445
You have no responsibility of correcting
each other.

15:41.715 --> 15:46.007
(...) Remember that this is meant for you
when you were not Sahaja Yogis.

15:46.231 --> 15:51.489
Today it is not meant for you. So you
won’t feel guilty.

15:53.301 --> 15:56.071
First remember you are Sahaja Yogis,
you are My children

15:56.272 --> 15:58.789
and I love you very much, very, very much.

15:58.990 --> 16:03.639
So please have confidence in yourself,
complete confidence in yourself, all right?

16:03.840 --> 16:06.867
That’s the greatest thing you can give Me
today as a present.

16:07.068 --> 16:09.101
May God bless you!
