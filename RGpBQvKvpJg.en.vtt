WEBVTT

01:43.733 --> 01:46.733
Today is a sad day for Me because

01:47.067 --> 01:49.359
we'll be now parting.

01:49.650 --> 01:55.566
I may not be able to meet you in Bombay.

01:55.900 --> 02:04.900
May be for a year this may not happen for some of you,

02:14.192 --> 02:20.317
and I would like to give you

02:20.691 --> 02:28.317
a little advice about the growth within yourself.

02:37.109 --> 02:39.317
It is believed by people

02:43.691 --> 02:47.817
that God is helping us

02:48.109 --> 02:50.608
and we are in His kingdom.

02:51.691 --> 02:55.525
So whatever happens He looks after us.

02:58.817 --> 02:59.817
It is true

03:01.650 --> 03:04.441
but as you are the instrument of the God

03:04.817 --> 03:07.067
you have to also look after yourself.

03:07.359 --> 03:08.650
For today's delay

03:10.359 --> 03:12.234
I would like to apologize

03:12.566 --> 03:14.067
but the delay comes

03:14.359 --> 03:17.733
because from Poona Mr. Kulkarni was to come

03:18.067 --> 03:20.566
and see us do this puja.

03:20.858 --> 03:23.942
Now I told him .?..

03:25.441 --> 03:27.566
that his wife is a negative lady,

03:27.817 --> 03:31.234
and he doesn't understand his own importance, I would say.

03:31.525 --> 03:34.858
As a leader you must understand your importance.

03:35.150 --> 03:37.650
And another person who came,

03:37.942 --> 03:39.067
he asked, "Why don't you come with me?"

03:39.234 --> 03:40.817
He said, "I have to come with my wife."

03:42.109 --> 03:44.817
And that's how this delay has taken place

03:45.109 --> 03:46.234
because he's not here.

03:46.525 --> 03:48.359
He said he'll come for puja

03:48.650 --> 03:52.067
so the main thing was first to arrive here in time

03:52.359 --> 03:54.733
without a negative force pulling him.

03:55.067 --> 03:58.067
So we conclude that

03:58.359 --> 04:01.650
it is important that first of all we should know

04:01.942 --> 04:05.234
that in any way we should not try

04:05.525 --> 04:08.733
to have  any negative forces attacking us

04:09.025 --> 04:12.234
or involving us or attaching to us.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.359
She may be your wife,

04:14.691 --> 04:15.483
may be your husband,

04:17.775 --> 04:19.775
may be your son, may be your daughter,

04:20.067 --> 04:20.775
may be anyone.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.775
You must see that that person is negative

04:25.775 --> 04:26.900
through vibrations

04:28.192 --> 04:31.359
and don't have anything to do with such a person.

04:31.942 --> 04:35.566
Don't have, never listen to such a person,

04:35.858 --> 04:38.858
never agree to what that person says

04:39.150 --> 04:40.858
and do as you please

04:41.150 --> 04:43.441
because in vibrations you will know

04:43.691 --> 04:45.483
that the person  is negative.

04:45.691 --> 04:47.900
Of course that doesn't give you a hand

04:48.192 --> 04:50.983
to sort of a destroy another person

04:51.317 --> 04:55.608
or to completely

04:57.650 --> 05:00.525
finish Sahaja Yoga in that person.

05:00.817 --> 05:02.733
But on the contrary with love

05:03.025 --> 05:08.234
and proper advice you have to tell that person

05:08.525 --> 05:12.733
that, "You are being negative, you are a negative person.

05:13.025 --> 05:15.441
We are getting negative vibrations from you."

05:15.733 --> 05:19.942
Now that person may persist on the negativity,

05:20.234 --> 05:24.234
may be because he does not know how to get out of it

05:24.400 --> 05:27.733
or may be she does not know how to get rid of it

05:28.025 --> 05:29.691
or may be laziness.

05:29.983 --> 05:32.400
May be that her arrogance,

05:32.691 --> 05:34.483
because such people can be very arrogant

05:34.817 --> 05:36.900
and adamant and high-handed,

05:37.192 --> 05:38.900
could be very arbitrary also

05:39.192 --> 05:41.691
and could be so intelligent

05:42.025 --> 05:45.317
that they would cheat themselves with their own intelligence.

05:45.650 --> 05:49.025
They will not accept your advice,  whatever it is.

05:49.317 --> 05:51.858
Try to tell them as far as possible,

05:52.067 --> 05:53.858
you have to go to a great extent,

05:54.150 --> 05:55.775
because you are not here for them,

05:55.942 --> 05:58.150
you are here for yourself and for God.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.650
So you have no business to waste your energy

06:01.942 --> 06:06.067
with somebody who is a positively negative person.

06:10.983 --> 06:14.359
And in that the approach should be such that

06:14.691 --> 06:17.483
you try to help that person as far as possible.

06:17.775 --> 06:21.566
Supposing she has some bad habits,

06:21.858 --> 06:23.275
she's taking drugs, all right,

06:23.525 --> 06:26.817
try to take out that part, the drug and all that,

06:26.983 --> 06:28.483
try to do whatever is possible.

06:28.817 --> 06:31.691
Give a bandhan, beat her with shoes

06:31.900 --> 06:33.691
but your attention should not be

06:34.025 --> 06:37.192
completely towards one person who's negative.

06:37.483 --> 06:40.067
Normally in an ashram, I've seen,

06:40.359 --> 06:42.192
mostly one negative person appears

06:42.483 --> 06:45.067
and the whole ashram gets upset.

06:45.359 --> 06:46.983
It's a very common thing

06:47.275 --> 06:51.275
because one nasty person can spoil the whole show.

06:51.566 --> 06:54.942
Like today I had to spend some money
with another nasty person

06:55.025 --> 06:56.858
just for nothing at all,

06:57.150 --> 06:58.650
and because she's negative

06:58.858 --> 07:00.650
I had to fight it out Myself,

07:00.858 --> 07:02.942
I did not know how others are going to fight it out.

07:05.275 --> 07:08.067
But you have to tell frankly on the face

07:08.275 --> 07:10.441
that, "If you want to go to hell you can go,

07:11.650 --> 07:15.650
if you want to go to God then you should change yourself,

07:15.900 --> 07:18.483
you have to transform yourself, you have to
be all right."

07:18.775 --> 07:20.983
Everyone can get cured.

07:21.275 --> 07:25.900
Lazy lumps are the only difficult things,

07:26.192 --> 07:28.359
lazy people, because they have excuses.

07:28.608 --> 07:30.109
They are the most difficult things,

07:30.359 --> 07:34.192
lazy people are the most difficult people I have seen.

07:34.483 --> 07:37.359
If the person is not a lazy person,

07:37.608 --> 07:40.775
it's very easy to make him do things.

07:41.109 --> 07:43.608
For a lazy person everything is
difficult

07:43.900 --> 07:46.983
because he's indulging into laziness.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.608
But one must remember one principle of Sahaja Yoga

07:50.900 --> 07:52.441
which is very important.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.275
I think one should write it down in your heart.

07:55.566 --> 08:00.359
This is a very important essence of Sahaja Yoga,

08:00.691 --> 08:04.691
of how to grow, that you should know
how to raise your Kundalini.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.192
You should know how to meditate

08:11.483 --> 08:14.359
and to find out about your problems,

08:14.691 --> 08:20.691
your defects and then remove them and raise your Kundalini.

08:21.275 --> 08:23.483
If you cannot raise your Kundalini

08:23.650 --> 08:25.983
you cannot improve in Sahaja Yoga.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.192
Now the Kundalini falls off with many things, as you know,

08:31.525 --> 08:32.525
if you have defects. Even supposing

08:32.817 --> 08:34.441
you have a weakness for your wife,

08:34.650 --> 08:37.942
you worry about her, you think about her or your husband,

08:38.275 --> 08:40.441
who is a negative person,

08:40.441 --> 08:42.441
the Kundalini will be sucked down.

08:42.775 --> 08:48.359
It will be sucked down with all these negative attentions,

08:48.691 --> 08:50.733
any kind of a negative attention you have,

08:51.025 --> 08:52.317
it will be sucked down.

09:11.525 --> 09:14.150
And such negative people always push forward,

09:14.483 --> 09:16.150
they'll sit in front of Me,

09:16.483 --> 09:18.858
they'll be just there to trouble Me.

09:19.150 --> 09:20.900
They'll never understand that we should be at the back,

09:21.109 --> 09:22.441
they are very great show-offs.

09:22.733 --> 09:25.942
They will sit just in front of My eyes, I see them, just

09:26.150 --> 09:27.942
I put My eyes straightforward and the person

09:28.150 --> 09:30.025
is straightforward before My eyes.

09:30.317 --> 09:31.109
Is a sign

09:31.317 --> 09:34.817
that they are all the time trying to displease the Goddess,

09:35.109 --> 09:36.608
all the time. Of course

09:36.817 --> 09:38.733
your Mother is such a funny Goddess

09:39.025 --> 09:40.441
that She never gets displeased.

09:40.733 --> 09:43.025
But there so many others who get displeased.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.317
I wish I had known that,

09:46.650 --> 09:49.317
I really don't know, I think I'm nothing but forgiveness

09:49.566 --> 09:51.900
and I just don't recognize it.

09:52.234 --> 09:53.733
But it's a common point.

09:53.942 --> 09:59.942
A person who is a very positive person
doesn't come forward much,

10:00.234 --> 10:04.025
keeps out, doesn't force Me to do things.

10:04.317 --> 10:05.483
Otherwise they'll force Me,

10:05.650 --> 10:08.775
"Do this, do this, sit down like this, I'll have this.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.150
" Unless and until I tell you, you should not.

10:12.441 --> 10:15.234
Like I know some people, it's a headache to be with them

10:15.566 --> 10:16.317
where they'll ask,

10:16.608 --> 10:19.608
"Should I give you tea, should I bring this for you?"

10:19.900 --> 10:21.733
Why? I'll tell you if I need it.

10:22.025 --> 10:24.650
"Will you take this, will you take that,

10:24.942 --> 10:26.192
would you have this,

10:26.483 --> 10:29.192
would you like a white tea or a black tea or a yellow tea."

10:32.900 --> 10:35.900
I've no time to think about all these nonsensical things.

10:39.483 --> 10:43.109
And that's what distracts My attention from them and

10:43.441 --> 10:47.150
they don't get -it's a vicious circle
-they don't get My blessings.

10:48.150 --> 10:50.525
Linda, you are the one, now go on that side,

10:50.817 --> 10:53.234
you know that very well and you are the one who'll sit in front.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.983
Now I can tell you how many who are sitting in front of Me,

10:56.275 --> 10:58.983
most of them would be negative people, except for Alexandra,

10:59.192 --> 11:03.608
I can see that. Another is Martine. Is she there?

11:03.691 --> 11:06.234
Martine catches very well, yes, second one must be Martine,

11:06.441 --> 11:09.317
yes, come along. Martine catches very much.

11:09.608 --> 11:12.234
And you people don't want to see that you catch,

11:12.525 --> 11:15.441
you people don't want to see that you catch

11:15.733 --> 11:19.150
and then what happens that it affects the other person.

11:20.817 --> 11:23.109
The leaders are affected.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.608
Who is next? Now who is next, let's see.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.400
Behind her, she has eye trouble, she has a problem,

11:32.608 --> 11:35.109
she should not sit in front, she should be on the side.

11:38.275 --> 11:38.775
It's all right.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.691
I need not worry that far

11:40.900 --> 11:42.775
but still, let her sit on the side.

11:51.109 --> 11:53.900
I've just pointed it out to you

11:54.192 --> 11:59.275
that you can make out a negative person who has problems.

11:59.566 --> 12:01.192
First of all, complaining type:

12:01.525 --> 12:04.317
Anybody who is complaining of nature is negative,

12:05.109 --> 12:06.900
anybody who complains is negative.

12:07.192 --> 12:08.608
I never complain, do I?

12:08.900 --> 12:10.400
Did I ever complain.

12:10.608 --> 12:13.900
I've been to all your programs anywhere,  did I ever complain

12:14.192 --> 12:16.359
that the bed is not all right?

12:17.650 --> 12:20.067
Suddenly the other day I discovered the bed on I sleep

12:20.359 --> 12:22.650
is really hard like a rock, really.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.359
I just suddenly discovered because I sat on it.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.858
But I didn't complain to anyone.

12:28.150 --> 12:29.067
I said, "It's all right."

12:29.359 --> 12:31.650
Because I'm quite comfortable Myself with it.

12:31.942 --> 12:33.858
So this is it that shows a person

12:34.150 --> 12:35.566
who's not comfortable within himself

12:35.858 --> 12:39.566
is still negative and such a person should try to

12:39.733 --> 12:41.234
keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

12:41.566 --> 12:44.067
That's the best way the person is going to be helped.

12:44.359 --> 12:46.400
For negative people also you must remember

12:46.733 --> 12:48.817
you must try to keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

12:49.109 --> 12:50.566
Don't try to show off,

12:50.858 --> 12:53.275
because such a person always wants to come forward.

12:53.566 --> 12:55.942
Why? Because he'll be blessed,

12:56.942 --> 12:58.441
because he'll be saved.

12:59.566 --> 13:03.067
It's a kind of a, like a beggar coming to a rich man,

13:04.858 --> 13:05.858
but it's not so.

13:06.150 --> 13:07.858
In Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

13:08.067 --> 13:09.067
everything is just the other way round,

13:09.234 --> 13:10.858
you can put everything the other way round,

13:11.150 --> 13:12.483
then you'll understand.

13:12.775 --> 13:15.275
In Sahaja Yoga those who keep

13:15.483 --> 13:17.275
out of My sight are better blessed.

13:21.359 --> 13:23.650
Those who do not ask Me questions,

13:23.942 --> 13:26.858
whether I should have this or that are better blessed.

13:28.150 --> 13:32.566
Those who do not claim anything from Me are better blessed.

13:32.858 --> 13:36.359
Those who do not challenge Me are better blessed.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.566
Miracles happen.

13:38.858 --> 13:40.359
Like in My passport,

13:40.650 --> 13:44.650
this has happened before also, I did not know in Australia,

13:44.900 --> 13:49.275
but Mr.Srivastava told Me that My passport has expired

13:49.566 --> 13:52.983
I must get the validity again sanctioned.

13:53.275 --> 13:55.942
When I came here, Warren told Me at least three times,

13:56.275 --> 13:57.900
then I asked Warren, "Should I go

13:58.109 --> 13:59.817
to Delhi to get it done

13:59.983 --> 14:02.109
because if I go to Hong Kong how will I do it,

14:02.359 --> 14:03.942
without a passport?"

14:05.275 --> 14:06.858
And then I said, "Let's see."

14:07.150 --> 14:08.441
I opened the passport

14:08.775 --> 14:10.858
- it's already sanctioned till eighty-eight.

14:21.359 --> 14:25.150
So, you see, for that one has to understand

14:25.608 --> 14:29.109
that we must know our priorities;

14:29.733 --> 14:32.025
we must know what is important. For Me

14:32.317 --> 14:33.983
it was important I have to go to Hong Kong,

14:34.275 --> 14:37.192
I couldn't find any time when I could go there, at a time

14:37.483 --> 14:38.359
when it would not be very hot.

14:38.858 --> 14:41.733
And just it worked out for Me,

14:42.025 --> 14:46.150
I don't have to go to Delhi first and I'm now ready to go.

14:47.441 --> 14:49.441
It has happened so many times

14:49.775 --> 14:52.858
and even if something goes wrong with My passport or

14:53.150 --> 14:54.483
anything because of negative forces,

14:54.691 --> 14:57.109
I use it for an advantage.

14:57.608 --> 15:00.608
So even if somebody is a negative person, use it

15:00.900 --> 15:04.192
for a positive thing.

15:04.483 --> 15:08.608
Now, example: I was going to America

15:09.900 --> 15:13.192
and I had sent My passport for visa

15:14.067 --> 15:16.775
and My husband who is so meticulous had taken it.

15:17.067 --> 15:19.983
And they gave the visa for the last year.

15:21.275 --> 15:22.566
When I went to the airport

15:22.900 --> 15:25.566
they said, "What? This is the visa for the last year.

15:26.691 --> 15:30.192
No, for the one year ahead, one year ahead they had given.

15:30.483 --> 15:32.775
So they said, "You can go next year, not this year,

15:33.025 --> 15:34.109
the visa is for next year."

15:34.983 --> 15:36.775
So I telephoned to My husband,

15:37.109 --> 15:39.608
it was a Sunday,

15:39.900 --> 15:43.691
he just got out of bed, he ran up and down,

15:43.983 --> 15:45.983
poor fellow, he said, "How is it I didn't see?"

15:46.192 --> 15:47.067
I said, "You didn't see.

15:47.275 --> 15:49.566
What has happened is that you didn't see.

15:49.858 --> 15:51.192
The fellow who did it was quite,

15:51.359 --> 15:54.483
quite speedy I think, so he gave Me one year ahead,

15:54.775 --> 15:56.150
so now better find out."

15:56.441 --> 15:58.441
I mean, this is what happens to the speedy people.

15:58.775 --> 16:01.275
They'll give you visa for one year ahead.

16:03.858 --> 16:06.275
That's another extreme positivity.

16:07.566 --> 16:11.067
Now, then as a result of his running up and down,

16:11.317 --> 16:13.441
they all got shattered,
you know the Americans especially felt,

16:13.650 --> 16:15.441
"Oh God, what a mistake it was."

16:15.650 --> 16:17.566
So they gave Me visa for five years.

16:26.775 --> 16:29.650
So instead of feeling unhappy about the negativity

16:29.858 --> 16:31.775
and making miserable faces

16:32.775 --> 16:35.441
and making yourself miserable and Me miserable with that,

16:35.733 --> 16:41.192
best is to laugh it out and use that negativity for your positivity.

16:42.691 --> 16:43.441
In the beginning only

16:43.650 --> 16:46.275
it happened that once we were going to Nasik,

16:46.566 --> 16:50.067
I while going to Nasik ..?...

16:50.359 --> 16:55.775
while going to Nasik  our car failed

16:56.067 --> 16:56.858
and everybody said, "Mother,

16:57.150 --> 16:58.775
your car never fails, how it has failed?"

16:59.025 --> 17:02.109
I said, "Let it be, it's all right, it's very nice here,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.817
I can look around, I can see around and all that."

17:05.109 --> 17:07.942
They couldn't understand why I was so relaxed about it.

17:08.067 --> 17:10.858
So the car failed and it took about one hour.

17:11.192 --> 17:13.275
Now the people who were sahaja yogis before

17:13.483 --> 17:14.775
never used to cure anybody,

17:14.983 --> 17:16.817
never used to look at anyone,

17:17.025 --> 17:19.608
never used to raise anybody's Kundalini, all very frightened.

17:20.608 --> 17:22.275
But as I was not there,

17:22.566 --> 17:25.067
they felt very challenged because there's such a big crowd there,

17:25.359 --> 17:26.400
they didn't know what to do.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.234
So they said, "All right, we'll raise your Kundalini."

17:29.109 --> 17:30.608
That's how they started doing it

17:30.817 --> 17:32.733
and it's helping now, [we were now,?]

17:33.025 --> 17:33.608
that you are doing it.

17:33.817 --> 17:35.150
Otherwise they would not touch it.

17:37.608 --> 17:39.525
So every disadvantage,

17:39.858 --> 17:43.150
every negativity is to be used for positivity.

17:43.441 --> 17:47.733
As I've told you before also an example of a little cell

17:48.025 --> 17:52.025
going inside the Mother Earth, sees a big boulder there,

17:52.275 --> 17:55.983
goes round it, [ties?] round it again and again and again

17:56.192 --> 18:00.691
and uses it for further holding of the tree,

18:00.983 --> 18:02.400
for the support of the tree.

18:04.234 --> 18:06.525
That is what is wisdom,

18:09.650 --> 18:11.650
that is what is wisdom

18:11.942 --> 18:18.025
and this wisdom comes through meditation,
meditative method.

18:18.359 --> 18:23.150
So you must everyday meditate and raise your Kundalini,

18:23.441 --> 18:25.566
otherwise you cannot grow by saying,

18:25.900 --> 18:26.817
"Mother, I love you,

18:27.109 --> 18:31.900
I love you," writing Me ten pages letters,

18:32.192 --> 18:33.900
which is impossible to read,

18:33.983 --> 18:37.359
doing all kinds of things like that

18:37.691 --> 18:40.400
and asking Me questions morning till evening.

18:41.150 --> 18:44.067
Nothing, nothing is going to help you

18:44.359 --> 18:46.983
to understand Me or to understand yourself

18:47.192 --> 18:48.483
or to understand Sahaja Yoga

18:48.775 --> 18:50.275
or to grow in Sahaja Yoga.

18:50.608 --> 18:53.483
You may talk, discuss, do what you like,

18:53.775 --> 18:57.192
to understand Sahaja Yoga best is to keep very happy.

18:57.483 --> 19:01.275
Happy faces, happiness within yourself,

19:01.566 --> 19:03.566
joy within yourself,

19:03.900 --> 19:06.900
try to see the essence of joy in everything,

19:07.192 --> 19:09.775
don't try to criticize, make yourself miserable.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.691
But to raise your Kundalini

19:14.983 --> 19:17.483
every morning religiously,

19:17.775 --> 19:20.983
every morning, every night raise your Kundalini.

19:21.317 --> 19:25.817
Kundalini is like the nourishment, the nourishment,

19:26.109 --> 19:32.483
the water of life for the growth of your inner being.

19:32.775 --> 19:34.608
If you do not meditate,

19:34.900 --> 19:36.900
if you do not know how to raise your Kundalini,

19:37.192 --> 19:38.691
you better try to learn it.

19:39.025 --> 19:41.608
Negative people always avoid that

19:41.900 --> 19:43.400
because then they feel burnings,

19:43.691 --> 19:46.067
they feel this. Face it up for a while,

19:46.067 --> 19:49.192
doesn't matter, face it up, clear out yourself

19:49.483 --> 19:52.109
and see that you raise your own Kundalini.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.109
Don't blame your husband, don't blame your wife,

19:55.359 --> 19:57.775
don't blame your children, don't blame your atmosphere,

19:58.067 --> 20:00.275
nothing of the kind. You can go in the jungles everyday,

20:00.566 --> 20:02.441
you can go anywhere you want to,

20:02.733 --> 20:04.150
if you want to do it, you can do it.

20:04.441 --> 20:07.817
But people must understand that now we are saints,

20:08.109 --> 20:10.192
and saints have to do that.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.566
You'll be surprised if you start meditating,

20:15.900 --> 20:18.275
most of your problems will disappear

20:18.566 --> 20:23.275
because all physical problems will be looked after by God.

20:23.566 --> 20:25.900
All material problems will be looked after.

20:26.192 --> 20:29.483
All other problems, family problems will be looked after.

20:29.775 --> 20:34.691
But the main problem is how to make you do it.

20:34.983 --> 20:41.067
It's like once you eat your food
your tongue can taste it,

20:41.317 --> 20:44.192
it gets the saliva, it goes down,

20:44.483 --> 20:45.483
it's all looked after,

20:45.691 --> 20:48.067
it goes down properly, down below it is all

20:48.359 --> 20:50.359
the juices are secreted,

20:50.483 --> 20:52.566
they know that the food is coming,

20:52.858 --> 20:57.067
it is digested in different parts, as it is, it is all built-in.

20:57.067 --> 20:59.150
But you must put it in the mouth,

21:03.359 --> 21:06.942
and this is what is the mechanism of Sahaja Yoga is

21:07.025 --> 21:11.650
that you must meditate and raise your Kundalini.

21:11.858 --> 21:15.441
In so many ways, in so many styles, in so many angles

21:15.775 --> 21:18.566
I have said this again and again and again and again.

21:20.775 --> 21:22.441
But that's what we do not do.

21:23.775 --> 21:26.942
And know your purpose, you must know your purpose.

21:27.275 --> 21:28.275
Like as I said

21:28.483 --> 21:31.483
that  the leaders do not know their importance at all.

21:32.775 --> 21:35.775
They behave sometimes in a manner which I can't understand.

21:37.067 --> 21:40.775
They become so silly about their wives, their husbands

21:41.109 --> 21:42.192
that I cannot understand.

21:42.483 --> 21:44.775
That's not important at all.

21:45.109 --> 21:47.691
If they're leaders, they have responsibility.

21:48.525 --> 21:51.525
Secondly, the leaders must tell off

21:51.733 --> 21:53.150
people who are to be told off,

21:53.441 --> 21:54.441
it's very important.

22:01.150 --> 22:03.775
If you cannot tell off people, it's no use.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.942
And that's how the leadership is not going to be respected,

22:10.275 --> 22:13.150
if you do not tell off people who are negative.

22:13.483 --> 22:16.983
One negative problem comes in, immediately they'll report it,

22:17.275 --> 22:18.608
I immediately know this is his wife

22:18.817 --> 22:20.400
or husband must be doing nonsense there.

22:20.691 --> 22:22.483
Immediately it is reported,

22:22.775 --> 22:24.275
"This is happening, that is happening,"

22:24.483 --> 22:26.275
is a sign of negativity.

22:27.983 --> 22:32.150
Immediately you can solve the problem, give bandhans.

22:35.525 --> 22:39.150
The simplest way is to sit before My photograph

22:39.359 --> 22:41.775
and just say, "Mother, please this is the problem," finished.

22:43.067 --> 22:45.025
There's no need to take a telephone and

22:45.317 --> 22:47.733
telephone to Me at about two o'clock in the night.

22:50.025 --> 22:53.441
Just do that, but the trouble is you cannot

22:53.733 --> 22:56.650
because your system is not yet reached that point.

22:57.983 --> 22:59.067
It's such a vicious circle.

22:59.359 --> 23:01.858
Your system must reach that point

23:02.150 --> 23:04.275
where the connection is absolutely there,

23:04.525 --> 23:06.566
you don't care for leadership, anything,

23:06.858 --> 23:09.109
but you care for your inner growth.

23:09.359 --> 23:12.691
If your inner growth is in that position

23:12.691 --> 23:15.275
it will happen automatically.

23:20.109 --> 23:22.359
This is what it is, very difficult

23:22.691 --> 23:26.983
for people to understand that we have to be

23:27.317 --> 23:30.067
sensibly placed towards ourselves.

23:32.067 --> 23:35.067
Now about the leaders I would say this about others also,

23:35.359 --> 23:40.275
that we have to be very, very sensibly

23:40.483 --> 23:42.192
placed about ourselves.

23:42.650 --> 23:45.150
Are we sensible towards ourselves?

23:45.441 --> 23:47.858
Some old people behave like children,

23:48.192 --> 23:50.525
some children behave like old people in the

23:50.733 --> 23:54.317
sense that start telling off, answering back, misbehaving.

23:54.650 --> 23:58.150
We must know our age, our group,

23:58.441 --> 24:02.817
everything and behave in a manner that is dignified.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.817
In a small age also if a child talks like a child,

24:07.359 --> 24:09.775
he can be very, very positive.

24:13.275 --> 24:16.566
I must tell you that I've had some very, very funny reports

24:16.858 --> 24:19.150
about some people which was so shocking

24:19.483 --> 24:22.275
that how did they arbitrarily behaved.

24:23.525 --> 24:27.858
And it's only thing that is behind is the sense of leadership.

24:28.441 --> 24:31.150
I wanted to be leaders, this wanted to be leaders,

24:31.441 --> 24:32.150
that wanted to be leaders.

24:32.525 --> 24:35.858
There's nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga,

24:36.067 --> 24:38.359
you don't know your Mother is too capable.

24:39.650 --> 24:43.359
She doesn't need any leaders, you don't know Her,

24:43.650 --> 24:46.775
better know Her. She's too capable,

24:46.817 --> 24:49.025
very clever and cunning woman.

24:58.317 --> 25:00.817
She's all-powerful

25:01.150 --> 25:03.234
and She knows everything about you,

25:03.566 --> 25:05.400
She knows how to handle situations.

25:05.691 --> 25:09.025
She's not going to allow Sahaja Yoga

25:09.317 --> 25:11.317
disappear because of somebody's stupidity.

25:11.525 --> 25:12.317
Know that!

25:14.900 --> 25:18.317
Sitting down here I know about everything about everyone.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.983
I may look very simple, it's not so.

25:27.983 --> 25:30.608
That's why I have to tell you

25:30.608 --> 25:33.775
that you don't consider yourself

25:34.109 --> 25:43.192
to be endowed with some sort of a special power as a leader.

25:43.483 --> 25:49.775
Only that you have the power through your Mother

25:50.067 --> 25:51.566
which you have to assert.

25:51.858 --> 25:54.359
So, "Whatever I'm doing is the Mother Who is doing it."

25:54.691 --> 25:56.566
And when you do that you'll be amazed

25:56.858 --> 25:59.942
that  whatever you want  will be sensible,

26:00.275 --> 26:02.942
whatever you'll ask for it will be sensible

26:03.275 --> 26:06.067
- sensible means which is related to Sahaja Yoga.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.359
And whatever you do will be sensible.

26:10.733 --> 26:14.317
All your dignity, everything will pile up together,

26:14.650 --> 26:18.441
but foremost thing and the most important at

26:18.691 --> 26:21.109
any cost you must meditate.

26:26.150 --> 26:30.067
This is what I have to now tell to our Indians also

26:30.359 --> 26:33.650
but for you it is very important

26:34.942 --> 26:37.775
because now you are returning back to

26:39.067 --> 26:40.441
"the real place."

26:44.775 --> 26:48.650
Like yesterday somebody said to Me,  some westerner said,

26:48.942 --> 26:51.566
"Mother they are talking about why you left Vaikuntha

26:51.858 --> 26:54.150
and came to this India,

26:54.483 --> 26:57.483
is all right, but we would say why did you leave this India

26:57.775 --> 26:58.775
and came to us."

27:01.650 --> 27:04.275
Then the answer was there that the God

27:04.775 --> 27:09.067
God has become mad about the saints

27:09.359 --> 27:10.525
because of the saints

27:10.817 --> 27:12.025
and their company.

27:12.317 --> 27:15.192
But the saints have to be saints

27:15.525 --> 27:17.192
otherwise they become troublesome to Me.

27:19.317 --> 27:22.691
If I go to lunatic asylum

27:23.025 --> 27:24.109
nothing will happen to Me.

27:25.691 --> 27:30.109
If I go to say, to a cemetery, nothing will happen to Me.

27:31.733 --> 27:35.359
But if a saint catches even a slightest thing,

27:35.691 --> 27:37.483
that troubles Me, tortures Me,

27:37.775 --> 27:39.691
not outwardly may be, but inside.

27:44.983 --> 27:47.983
Because I've given you place in My heart,

27:48.359 --> 27:51.067
in My being, you circulate in My being.

27:54.650 --> 27:56.483
That is how I know about you.

27:56.775 --> 27:59.275
So if you really grow better,

27:59.608 --> 28:01.983
if you improve better

28:02.275 --> 28:04.691
it will be a thing of joy for you

28:04.983 --> 28:06.942
and the greatest joy for Me as well,

28:07.234 --> 28:09.150
that's all I want that you should be,

28:09.441 --> 28:12.067
nothing else, nothing else.

28:13.900 --> 28:17.359
Now one more assurance I want to give you

28:17.691 --> 28:22.775
that we are going to start certain projects in India.

28:23.025 --> 28:24.900
Now the time has come,

28:25.192 --> 28:27.983
we have acquired some land definitely now

28:28.317 --> 28:30.317
and we are going to work out

28:30.608 --> 28:33.525
some projects as soon as I settle down in India,

28:33.817 --> 28:36.608
we will start showing the manifestation of that.

28:36.900 --> 28:39.608
And maybe this kind of tour

28:39.900 --> 28:44.400
I may not be able to do after a few years.

28:44.691 --> 28:48.317
But then you yourself will be able to conduct  these

28:48.650 --> 28:50.817
tours in your own country, go round

28:51.109 --> 28:53.983
because this is a training period where you will learn how

28:54.317 --> 28:55.691
to do this kind of thing.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.983
Of course in your country it's rather difficult to get such people

28:59.317 --> 29:02.608
but how to contact: I started with one person.

29:02.900 --> 29:06.691
So I'm just a lady, housewife

29:06.983 --> 29:09.317
and if I could do it, why not you?

29:21.025 --> 29:25.858
So now go with a pleasant mind, enjoy yourself.

29:27.858 --> 29:30.858
It's very difficult for a mother to bear all this because

29:31.150 --> 29:33.566
when I leave India I feel terrible about the Indians,

29:33.858 --> 29:35.608
when I leave youI feel terrible about you.

29:35.900 --> 29:36.817
It's something horrible

29:36.983 --> 29:39.691
that I want that somehow or other we all should have one

29:39.900 --> 29:44.900
huge country of our own where we all settle down happily together.

29:57.025 --> 30:01.192
So on behalf of you I would like to thank all the Indians

30:01.525 --> 30:04.025
who have done so much for us,

30:04.317 --> 30:07.359
given us all the comfort, according to them it was discomfort

30:07.691 --> 30:09.275
but according to you it was comfort.

30:29.359 --> 30:30.983
Now you are going on this tour,

30:31.275 --> 30:32.192
I would request you not to discuss

30:32.483 --> 30:37.192
other mundane nonsensical things on the way but

30:37.483 --> 30:39.441
discuss Sahaja Yoga. Understand,

30:39.733 --> 30:42.359
there are people who are just new, tell them  about Sahaj Yog,

30:42.650 --> 30:44.608
let them know what is Sahaja Yoga is,

30:44.900 --> 30:48.359
also explain to them what is Sahaja Yoga.

30:48.650 --> 30:51.192
You'll be travelling now quite a lot

30:51.483 --> 30:53.817
and also you'll be going to places where

30:53.983 --> 30:55.608
we are going to have our projects done.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.858
You can have a look at it, will be a good idea

30:59.150 --> 31:03.150
and also you think about what kind of projects

31:03.359 --> 31:05.359
we can have in this country

31:05.650 --> 31:11.234
which will help them to achieve better results in Sahaja Yoga.

31:12.109 --> 31:14.525
All these we have to discuss

31:14.817 --> 31:18.525
and this group is much more serious-type,

31:18.691 --> 31:21.608
I think, and it's going to work out something seriously.

31:22.441 --> 31:26.858
About the future plans that we would like to have

31:27.150 --> 31:31.067
here and abroad and whatever are the dates and

31:31.359 --> 31:34.608
things you would like to do. In the month of May, June, July

31:34.817 --> 31:37.317
I would be in the West and

31:37.608 --> 31:40.150
May  I would like to keep for America,

31:40.441 --> 31:43.150
if possible, at least the second half of May.

31:43.441 --> 31:46.109
The rest of it you can adjust it the way you want to have

31:46.441 --> 31:49.525
and also arrange your programs among yourselves

31:49.817 --> 31:51.733
whichever way you say is all right.

31:52.067 --> 31:55.067
This time it was desired that I should go to Greece,

31:55.359 --> 31:58.150
I don't mind, I would like to go there and do the needful.

32:09.733 --> 32:12.817
I hope all the leaders have got the [chains?]

32:13.109 --> 32:16.025
I have given to Warren.

32:18.317 --> 32:19.441
All right, it's done now.

32:21.150 --> 32:24.150
I worry about all little, little things like that.

32:25.566 --> 32:28.359
..............................Marathi............................

39:59.100 --> 40:00.120
I am just telling them

40:00.200 --> 40:03.720
with hypocrisy with a double standard you cannot manage Sahaja Yoga.

40:03.720 --> 40:06.040
You cannot cheat yourself, you cannot cheat others.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.820
Cheating is not allowed. If you do cheating,

40:08.940 --> 40:10.920
you will cheat your Kundalini.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.480
Kundalini knows everything.

40:17.160 --> 40:19.700
[Marathi]

47:44.920 --> 47:49.480
Leaders should never make importance of their wives or their husbands, not at all.

47:49.900 --> 47:53.580
Otherwise you ruin us completely.

47:53.980 --> 47:55.760
Or we might have to take out a rule that

47:55.760 --> 47:58.760
nobody who has a wife or a husband is going to be a leader.

47:58.980 --> 48:01.580
One of the two things or children.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.040
It’s terrible it is sometimes.
