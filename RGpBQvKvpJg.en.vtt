00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.733
Today is a sad day for Me because

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:49.359
we'll be now parting.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.566
I may not be able to meet you in Bombay.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:04.900
May be for a year this may not happen for some of you,

00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:20.317
and I would like to give you

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:28.317
a little advice about the growth within yourself.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.317
It is believed by people

00:02:43.691 --> 00:02:47.817
that God is helping us

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.608
and we are in His kingdom.

00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:55.525
So whatever happens He looks after us.

00:02:58.817 --> 00:02:59.817
It is true

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.441
but as you are the instrument of the God

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.067
you have to also look after yourself.

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.650
For today's delay

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.234
I would like to apologize

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:14.067
but the delay comes

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.733
because from Poona Mr. Kulkarni was to come

00:03:18.067 --> 00:03:20.566
and see us do this puja.

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:23.942
Now I told him .?..

00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:27.566
that his wife is a negative lady,

00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:31.234
and he doesn't understand his own importance, I would say.

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:34.858
As a leader you must understand your importance.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.650
And another person who came,

00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:39.067
he asked, "Why don't you come with me?"

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:40.817
He said, "I have to come with my wife."

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.817
And that's how this delay has taken place

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.234
because he's not here.

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:48.359
He said he'll come for puja

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.067
so the main thing was first to arrive here in time

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.733
without a negative force pulling him.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:58.067
So we conclude that

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.650
it is important that first of all we should know

00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:05.234
that in any way we should not try

00:04:05.525 --> 00:04:08.733
to have  any negative forces attacking us

00:04:09.025 --> 00:04:12.234
or involving us or attaching to us.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.359
She may be your wife,

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:15.483
may be your husband,

00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:19.775
may be your son, may be your daughter,

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:20.775
may be anyone.

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:23.775
You must see that that person is negative

00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:26.900
through vibrations

00:04:28.192 --> 00:04:31.359
and don't have anything to do with such a person.

00:04:31.942 --> 00:04:35.566
Don't have, never listen to such a person,

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.858
never agree to what that person says

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.858
and do as you please

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.441
because in vibrations you will know

00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.483
that the person  is negative.

00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:47.900
Of course that doesn't give you a hand

00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:50.983
to sort of a destroy another person

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:55.608
or to completely

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.525
finish Sahaja Yoga in that person.

00:05:00.817 --> 00:05:02.733
But on the contrary with love

00:05:03.025 --> 00:05:08.234
and proper advice you have to tell that person

00:05:08.525 --> 00:05:12.733
that, "You are being negative, you are a negative person.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.441
We are getting negative vibrations from you."

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:19.942
Now that person may persist on the negativity,

00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:24.234
may be because he does not know how to get out of it

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.733
or may be she does not know how to get rid of it

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.691
or may be laziness.

00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:32.400
May be that her arrogance,

00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:34.483
because such people can be very arrogant

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:36.900
and adamant and high-handed,

00:05:37.192 --> 00:05:38.900
could be very arbitrary also

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:41.691
and could be so intelligent

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:45.317
that they would cheat themselves with their own intelligence.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.025
They will not accept your advice,  whatever it is.

00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:51.858
Try to tell them as far as possible,

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:53.858
you have to go to a great extent,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.775
because you are not here for them,

00:05:55.942 --> 00:05:58.150
you are here for yourself and for God.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.650
So you have no business to waste your energy

00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:06.067
with somebody who is a positively negative person.

00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:14.359
And in that the approach should be such that

00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.483
you try to help that person as far as possible.

00:06:17.775 --> 00:06:21.566
Supposing she has some bad habits,

00:06:21.858 --> 00:06:23.275
she's taking drugs, all right,

00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:26.817
try to take out that part, the drug and all that,

00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:28.483
try to do whatever is possible.

00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:31.691
Give a bandhan, beat her with shoes

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.691
but your attention should not be

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:37.192
completely towards one person who's negative.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:40.067
Normally in an ashram, I've seen,

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.192
mostly one negative person appears

00:06:42.483 --> 00:06:45.067
and the whole ashram gets upset.

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:46.983
It's a very common thing

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:51.275
because one nasty person can spoil the whole show.

00:06:51.566 --> 00:06:54.942
Like today I had to spend some money
with another nasty person

00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:56.858
just for nothing at all,

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.650
and because she's negative

00:06:58.858 --> 00:07:00.650
I had to fight it out Myself,

00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:02.942
I did not know how others are going to fight it out.

00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:08.067
But you have to tell frankly on the face

00:07:08.275 --> 00:07:10.441
that, "If you want to go to hell you can go,

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.650
if you want to go to God then you should change yourself,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.483
you have to transform yourself, you have to
be all right."

00:07:18.775 --> 00:07:20.983
Everyone can get cured.

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:25.900
Lazy lumps are the only difficult things,

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:28.359
lazy people, because they have excuses.

00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:30.109
They are the most difficult things,

00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:34.192
lazy people are the most difficult people I have seen.

00:07:34.483 --> 00:07:37.359
If the person is not a lazy person,

00:07:37.608 --> 00:07:40.775
it's very easy to make him do things.

00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:43.608
For a lazy person everything is
difficult

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.983
because he's indulging into laziness.

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:50.608
But one must remember one principle of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.441
which is very important.

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:55.275
I think one should write it down in your heart.

00:07:55.566 --> 00:08:00.359
This is a very important essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:04.691
of how to grow, that you should know
how to raise your Kundalini.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.192
You should know how to meditate

00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:14.359
and to find out about your problems,

00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:20.691
your defects and then remove them and raise your Kundalini.

00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:23.483
If you cannot raise your Kundalini

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.983
you cannot improve in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:31.192
Now the Kundalini falls off with many things, as you know,

00:08:31.525 --> 00:08:32.525
if you have defects. Even supposing

00:08:32.817 --> 00:08:34.441
you have a weakness for your wife,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.942
you worry about her, you think about her or your husband,

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:40.441
who is a negative person,

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:42.441
the Kundalini will be sucked down.

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:48.359
It will be sucked down with all these negative attentions,

00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:50.733
any kind of a negative attention you have,

00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:52.317
it will be sucked down.

00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:14.150
And such negative people always push forward,

00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:16.150
they'll sit in front of Me,

00:09:16.483 --> 00:09:18.858
they'll be just there to trouble Me.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.900
They'll never understand that we should be at the back,

00:09:21.109 --> 00:09:22.441
they are very great show-offs.

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:25.942
They will sit just in front of My eyes, I see them, just

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.942
I put My eyes straightforward and the person

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.025
is straightforward before My eyes.

00:09:30.317 --> 00:09:31.109
Is a sign

00:09:31.317 --> 00:09:34.817
that they are all the time trying to displease the Goddess,

00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:36.608
all the time. Of course

00:09:36.817 --> 00:09:38.733
your Mother is such a funny Goddess

00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:40.441
that She never gets displeased.

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:43.025
But there so many others who get displeased.

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.317
I wish I had known that,

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.317
I really don't know, I think I'm nothing but forgiveness

00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:51.900
and I just don't recognize it.

00:09:52.234 --> 00:09:53.733
But it's a common point.

00:09:53.942 --> 00:09:59.942
A person who is a very positive person
doesn't come forward much,

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:04.025
keeps out, doesn't force Me to do things.

00:10:04.317 --> 00:10:05.483
Otherwise they'll force Me,

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.775
"Do this, do this, sit down like this, I'll have this.

00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:12.150
" Unless and until I tell you, you should not.

00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:15.234
Like I know some people, it's a headache to be with them

00:10:15.566 --> 00:10:16.317
where they'll ask,

00:10:16.608 --> 00:10:19.608
"Should I give you tea, should I bring this for you?"

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.733
Why? I'll tell you if I need it.

00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:24.650
"Will you take this, will you take that,

00:10:24.942 --> 00:10:26.192
would you have this,

00:10:26.483 --> 00:10:29.192
would you like a white tea or a black tea or a yellow tea."

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.900
I've no time to think about all these nonsensical things.

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:43.109
And that's what distracts My attention from them and

00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:47.150
they don't get -it's a vicious circle
-they don't get My blessings.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.525
Linda, you are the one, now go on that side,

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:53.234
you know that very well and you are the one who'll sit in front.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.983
Now I can tell you how many who are sitting in front of Me,

00:10:56.275 --> 00:10:58.983
most of them would be negative people, except for Alexandra,

00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:03.608
I can see that. Another is Martine. Is she there?

00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:06.234
Martine catches very well, yes, second one must be Martine,

00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:09.317
yes, come along. Martine catches very much.

00:11:09.608 --> 00:11:12.234
And you people don't want to see that you catch,

00:11:12.525 --> 00:11:15.441
you people don't want to see that you catch

00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:19.150
and then what happens that it affects the other person.

00:11:20.817 --> 00:11:23.109
The leaders are affected.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.608
Who is next? Now who is next, let's see.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.400
Behind her, she has eye trouble, she has a problem,

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.109
she should not sit in front, she should be on the side.

00:11:38.275 --> 00:11:38.775
It's all right.

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:40.691
I need not worry that far

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.775
but still, let her sit on the side.

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:53.900
I've just pointed it out to you

00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:59.275
that you can make out a negative person who has problems.

00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:01.192
First of all, complaining type:

00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:04.317
Anybody who is complaining of nature is negative,

00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:06.900
anybody who complains is negative.

00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:08.608
I never complain, do I?

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.400
Did I ever complain.

00:12:10.608 --> 00:12:13.900
I've been to all your programs anywhere,  did I ever complain

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.359
that the bed is not all right?

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.067
Suddenly the other day I discovered the bed on I sleep

00:12:20.359 --> 00:12:22.650
is really hard like a rock, really.

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:25.359
I just suddenly discovered because I sat on it.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.858
But I didn't complain to anyone.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.067
I said, "It's all right."

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:31.650
Because I'm quite comfortable Myself with it.

00:12:31.942 --> 00:12:33.858
So this is it that shows a person

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.566
who's not comfortable within himself

00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:39.566
is still negative and such a person should try to

00:12:39.733 --> 00:12:41.234
keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:41.566 --> 00:12:44.067
That's the best way the person is going to be helped.

00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:46.400
For negative people also you must remember

00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.817
you must try to keep out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:50.566
Don't try to show off,

00:12:50.858 --> 00:12:53.275
because such a person always wants to come forward.

00:12:53.566 --> 00:12:55.942
Why? Because he'll be blessed,

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.441
because he'll be saved.

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:03.067
It's a kind of a, like a beggar coming to a rich man,

00:13:04.858 --> 00:13:05.858
but it's not so.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.858
In Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:09.067
everything is just the other way round,

00:13:09.234 --> 00:13:10.858
you can put everything the other way round,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.483
then you'll understand.

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:15.275
In Sahaja Yoga those who keep

00:13:15.483 --> 00:13:17.275
out of My sight are better blessed.

00:13:21.359 --> 00:13:23.650
Those who do not ask Me questions,

00:13:23.942 --> 00:13:26.858
whether I should have this or that are better blessed.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.566
Those who do not claim anything from Me are better blessed.

00:13:32.858 --> 00:13:36.359
Those who do not challenge Me are better blessed.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.566
Miracles happen.

00:13:38.858 --> 00:13:40.359
Like in My passport,

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.650
this has happened before also, I did not know in Australia,

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.275
but Mr.Srivastava told Me that My passport has expired

00:13:49.566 --> 00:13:52.983
I must get the validity again sanctioned.

00:13:53.275 --> 00:13:55.942
When I came here, Warren told Me at least three times,

00:13:56.275 --> 00:13:57.900
then I asked Warren, "Should I go

00:13:58.109 --> 00:13:59.817
to Delhi to get it done

00:13:59.983 --> 00:14:02.109
because if I go to Hong Kong how will I do it,

00:14:02.359 --> 00:14:03.942
without a passport?"

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:06.858
And then I said, "Let's see."

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.441
I opened the passport

00:14:08.775 --> 00:14:10.858
- it's already sanctioned till eighty-eight.

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:25.150
So, you see, for that one has to understand

00:14:25.608 --> 00:14:29.109
that we must know our priorities;

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:32.025
we must know what is important. For Me

00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:33.983
it was important I have to go to Hong Kong,

00:14:34.275 --> 00:14:37.192
I couldn't find any time when I could go there, at a time

00:14:37.483 --> 00:14:38.359
when it would not be very hot.

00:14:38.858 --> 00:14:41.733
And just it worked out for Me,

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:46.150
I don't have to go to Delhi first and I'm now ready to go.

00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.441
It has happened so many times

00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:52.858
and even if something goes wrong with My passport or

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.483
anything because of negative forces,

00:14:54.691 --> 00:14:57.109
I use it for an advantage.

00:14:57.608 --> 00:15:00.608
So even if somebody is a negative person, use it

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.192
for a positive thing.

00:15:04.483 --> 00:15:08.608
Now, example: I was going to America

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.192
and I had sent My passport for visa

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:16.775
and My husband who is so meticulous had taken it.

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.983
And they gave the visa for the last year.

00:15:21.275 --> 00:15:22.566
When I went to the airport

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.566
they said, "What? This is the visa for the last year.

00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:30.192
No, for the one year ahead, one year ahead they had given.

00:15:30.483 --> 00:15:32.775
So they said, "You can go next year, not this year,

00:15:33.025 --> 00:15:34.109
the visa is for next year."

00:15:34.983 --> 00:15:36.775
So I telephoned to My husband,

00:15:37.109 --> 00:15:39.608
it was a Sunday,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.691
he just got out of bed, he ran up and down,

00:15:43.983 --> 00:15:45.983
poor fellow, he said, "How is it I didn't see?"

00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:47.067
I said, "You didn't see.

00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:49.566
What has happened is that you didn't see.

00:15:49.858 --> 00:15:51.192
The fellow who did it was quite,

00:15:51.359 --> 00:15:54.483
quite speedy I think, so he gave Me one year ahead,

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:56.150
so now better find out."

00:15:56.441 --> 00:15:58.441
I mean, this is what happens to the speedy people.

00:15:58.775 --> 00:16:01.275
They'll give you visa for one year ahead.

00:16:03.858 --> 00:16:06.275
That's another extreme positivity.

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:11.067
Now, then as a result of his running up and down,

00:16:11.317 --> 00:16:13.441
they all got shattered,
you know the Americans especially felt,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.441
"Oh God, what a mistake it was."

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.566
So they gave Me visa for five years.

00:16:26.775 --> 00:16:29.650
So instead of feeling unhappy about the negativity

00:16:29.858 --> 00:16:31.775
and making miserable faces

00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:35.441
and making yourself miserable and Me miserable with that,

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:41.192
best is to laugh it out and use that negativity for your positivity.

00:16:42.691 --> 00:16:43.441
In the beginning only

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.275
it happened that once we were going to Nasik,

00:16:46.566 --> 00:16:50.067
I while going to Nasik ..?...

00:16:50.359 --> 00:16:55.775
while going to Nasik  our car failed

00:16:56.067 --> 00:16:56.858
and everybody said, "Mother,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.775
your car never fails, how it has failed?"

00:16:59.025 --> 00:17:02.109
I said, "Let it be, it's all right, it's very nice here,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.817
I can look around, I can see around and all that."

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.942
They couldn't understand why I was so relaxed about it.

00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:10.858
So the car failed and it took about one hour.

00:17:11.192 --> 00:17:13.275
Now the people who were sahaja yogis before

00:17:13.483 --> 00:17:14.775
never used to cure anybody,

00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:16.817
never used to look at anyone,

00:17:17.025 --> 00:17:19.608
never used to raise anybody's Kundalini, all very frightened.

00:17:20.608 --> 00:17:22.275
But as I was not there,

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:25.067
they felt very challenged because there's such a big crowd there,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.400
they didn't know what to do.

00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:28.234
So they said, "All right, we'll raise your Kundalini."

00:17:29.109 --> 00:17:30.608
That's how they started doing it

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:32.733
and it's helping now, [we were now,?]

00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:33.608
that you are doing it.

00:17:33.817 --> 00:17:35.150
Otherwise they would not touch it.

00:17:37.608 --> 00:17:39.525
So every disadvantage,

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:43.150
every negativity is to be used for positivity.

00:17:43.441 --> 00:17:47.733
As I've told you before also an example of a little cell

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:52.025
going inside the Mother Earth, sees a big boulder there,

00:17:52.275 --> 00:17:55.983
goes round it, [ties?] round it again and again and again

00:17:56.192 --> 00:18:00.691
and uses it for further holding of the tree,

00:18:00.983 --> 00:18:02.400
for the support of the tree.

00:18:04.234 --> 00:18:06.525
That is what is wisdom,

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.650
that is what is wisdom

00:18:11.942 --> 00:18:18.025
and this wisdom comes through meditation,
meditative method.

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:23.150
So you must everyday meditate and raise your Kundalini,

00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:25.566
otherwise you cannot grow by saying,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.817
"Mother, I love you,

00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:31.900
I love you," writing Me ten pages letters,

00:18:32.192 --> 00:18:33.900
which is impossible to read,

00:18:33.983 --> 00:18:37.359
doing all kinds of things like that

00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:40.400
and asking Me questions morning till evening.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.067
Nothing, nothing is going to help you

00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:46.983
to understand Me or to understand yourself

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.483
or to understand Sahaja Yoga

00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:50.275
or to grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:50.608 --> 00:18:53.483
You may talk, discuss, do what you like,

00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:57.192
to understand Sahaja Yoga best is to keep very happy.

00:18:57.483 --> 00:19:01.275
Happy faces, happiness within yourself,

00:19:01.566 --> 00:19:03.566
joy within yourself,

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.900
try to see the essence of joy in everything,

00:19:07.192 --> 00:19:09.775
don't try to criticize, make yourself miserable.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:14.691
But to raise your Kundalini

00:19:14.983 --> 00:19:17.483
every morning religiously,

00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:20.983
every morning, every night raise your Kundalini.

00:19:21.317 --> 00:19:25.817
Kundalini is like the nourishment, the nourishment,

00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:32.483
the water of life for the growth of your inner being.

00:19:32.775 --> 00:19:34.608
If you do not meditate,

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.900
if you do not know how to raise your Kundalini,

00:19:37.192 --> 00:19:38.691
you better try to learn it.

00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:41.608
Negative people always avoid that

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.400
because then they feel burnings,

00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:46.067
they feel this. Face it up for a while,

00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:49.192
doesn't matter, face it up, clear out yourself

00:19:49.483 --> 00:19:52.109
and see that you raise your own Kundalini.

00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:55.109
Don't blame your husband, don't blame your wife,

00:19:55.359 --> 00:19:57.775
don't blame your children, don't blame your atmosphere,

00:19:58.067 --> 00:20:00.275
nothing of the kind. You can go in the jungles everyday,

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.441
you can go anywhere you want to,

00:20:02.733 --> 00:20:04.150
if you want to do it, you can do it.

00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:07.817
But people must understand that now we are saints,

00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:10.192
and saints have to do that.

00:20:13.483 --> 00:20:15.566
You'll be surprised if you start meditating,

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.275
most of your problems will disappear

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:23.275
because all physical problems will be looked after by God.

00:20:23.566 --> 00:20:25.900
All material problems will be looked after.

00:20:26.192 --> 00:20:29.483
All other problems, family problems will be looked after.

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:34.691
But the main problem is how to make you do it.

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:41.067
It's like once you eat your food
your tongue can taste it,

00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:44.192
it gets the saliva, it goes down,

00:20:44.483 --> 00:20:45.483
it's all looked after,

00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.067
it goes down properly, down below it is all

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:50.359
the juices are secreted,

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:52.566
they know that the food is coming,

00:20:52.858 --> 00:20:57.067
it is digested in different parts, as it is, it is all built-in.

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:59.150
But you must put it in the mouth,

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:06.942
and this is what is the mechanism of Sahaja Yoga is

00:21:07.025 --> 00:21:11.650
that you must meditate and raise your Kundalini.

00:21:11.858 --> 00:21:15.441
In so many ways, in so many styles, in so many angles

00:21:15.775 --> 00:21:18.566
I have said this again and again and again and again.

00:21:20.775 --> 00:21:22.441
But that's what we do not do.

00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:26.942
And know your purpose, you must know your purpose.

00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:28.275
Like as I said

00:21:28.483 --> 00:21:31.483
that  the leaders do not know their importance at all.

00:21:32.775 --> 00:21:35.775
They behave sometimes in a manner which I can't understand.

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:40.775
They become so silly about their wives, their husbands

00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:42.192
that I cannot understand.

00:21:42.483 --> 00:21:44.775
That's not important at all.

00:21:45.109 --> 00:21:47.691
If they're leaders, they have responsibility.

00:21:48.525 --> 00:21:51.525
Secondly, the leaders must tell off

00:21:51.733 --> 00:21:53.150
people who are to be told off,

00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:54.441
it's very important.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.775
If you cannot tell off people, it's no use.

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:09.942
And that's how the leadership is not going to be respected,

00:22:10.275 --> 00:22:13.150
if you do not tell off people who are negative.

00:22:13.483 --> 00:22:16.983
One negative problem comes in, immediately they'll report it,

00:22:17.275 --> 00:22:18.608
I immediately know this is his wife

00:22:18.817 --> 00:22:20.400
or husband must be doing nonsense there.

00:22:20.691 --> 00:22:22.483
Immediately it is reported,

00:22:22.775 --> 00:22:24.275
"This is happening, that is happening,"

00:22:24.483 --> 00:22:26.275
is a sign of negativity.

00:22:27.983 --> 00:22:32.150
Immediately you can solve the problem, give bandhans.

00:22:35.525 --> 00:22:39.150
The simplest way is to sit before My photograph

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:41.775
and just say, "Mother, please this is the problem," finished.

00:22:43.067 --> 00:22:45.025
There's no need to take a telephone and

00:22:45.317 --> 00:22:47.733
telephone to Me at about two o'clock in the night.

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:53.441
Just do that, but the trouble is you cannot

00:22:53.733 --> 00:22:56.650
because your system is not yet reached that point.

00:22:57.983 --> 00:22:59.067
It's such a vicious circle.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:01.858
Your system must reach that point

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.275
where the connection is absolutely there,

00:23:04.525 --> 00:23:06.566
you don't care for leadership, anything,

00:23:06.858 --> 00:23:09.109
but you care for your inner growth.

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:12.691
If your inner growth is in that position

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:15.275
it will happen automatically.

00:23:20.109 --> 00:23:22.359
This is what it is, very difficult

00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:26.983
for people to understand that we have to be

00:23:27.317 --> 00:23:30.067
sensibly placed towards ourselves.

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:35.067
Now about the leaders I would say this about others also,

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:40.275
that we have to be very, very sensibly

00:23:40.483 --> 00:23:42.192
placed about ourselves.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:45.150
Are we sensible towards ourselves?

00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:47.858
Some old people behave like children,

00:23:48.192 --> 00:23:50.525
some children behave like old people in the

00:23:50.733 --> 00:23:54.317
sense that start telling off, answering back, misbehaving.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.150
We must know our age, our group,

00:23:58.441 --> 00:24:02.817
everything and behave in a manner that is dignified.

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:06.817
In a small age also if a child talks like a child,

00:24:07.359 --> 00:24:09.775
he can be very, very positive.

00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:16.566
I must tell you that I've had some very, very funny reports

00:24:16.858 --> 00:24:19.150
about some people which was so shocking

00:24:19.483 --> 00:24:22.275
that how did they arbitrarily behaved.

00:24:23.525 --> 00:24:27.858
And it's only thing that is behind is the sense of leadership.

00:24:28.441 --> 00:24:31.150
I wanted to be leaders, this wanted to be leaders,

00:24:31.441 --> 00:24:32.150
that wanted to be leaders.

00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:35.858
There's nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:38.359
you don't know your Mother is too capable.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.359
She doesn't need any leaders, you don't know Her,

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.775
better know Her. She's too capable,

00:24:46.817 --> 00:24:49.025
very clever and cunning woman.

00:24:58.317 --> 00:25:00.817
She's all-powerful

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.234
and She knows everything about you,

00:25:03.566 --> 00:25:05.400
She knows how to handle situations.

00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:09.025
She's not going to allow Sahaja Yoga

00:25:09.317 --> 00:25:11.317
disappear because of somebody's stupidity.

00:25:11.525 --> 00:25:12.317
Know that!

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.317
Sitting down here I know about everything about everyone.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.983
I may look very simple, it's not so.

00:25:27.983 --> 00:25:30.608
That's why I have to tell you

00:25:30.608 --> 00:25:33.775
that you don't consider yourself

00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:43.192
to be endowed with some sort of a special power as a leader.

00:25:43.483 --> 00:25:49.775
Only that you have the power through your Mother

00:25:50.067 --> 00:25:51.566
which you have to assert.

00:25:51.858 --> 00:25:54.359
So, "Whatever I'm doing is the Mother Who is doing it."

00:25:54.691 --> 00:25:56.566
And when you do that you'll be amazed

00:25:56.858 --> 00:25:59.942
that  whatever you want  will be sensible,

00:26:00.275 --> 00:26:02.942
whatever you'll ask for it will be sensible

00:26:03.275 --> 00:26:06.067
- sensible means which is related to Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:10.359
And whatever you do will be sensible.

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:14.317
All your dignity, everything will pile up together,

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.441
but foremost thing and the most important at

00:26:18.691 --> 00:26:21.109
any cost you must meditate.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:30.067
This is what I have to now tell to our Indians also

00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:33.650
but for you it is very important

00:26:34.942 --> 00:26:37.775
because now you are returning back to

00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:40.441
"the real place."

00:26:44.775 --> 00:26:48.650
Like yesterday somebody said to Me,  some westerner said,

00:26:48.942 --> 00:26:51.566
"Mother they are talking about why you left Vaikuntha

00:26:51.858 --> 00:26:54.150
and came to this India,

00:26:54.483 --> 00:26:57.483
is all right, but we would say why did you leave this India

00:26:57.775 --> 00:26:58.775
and came to us."

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.275
Then the answer was there that the God

00:27:04.775 --> 00:27:09.067
God has become mad about the saints

00:27:09.359 --> 00:27:10.525
because of the saints

00:27:10.817 --> 00:27:12.025
and their company.

00:27:12.317 --> 00:27:15.192
But the saints have to be saints

00:27:15.525 --> 00:27:17.192
otherwise they become troublesome to Me.

00:27:19.317 --> 00:27:22.691
If I go to lunatic asylum

00:27:23.025 --> 00:27:24.109
nothing will happen to Me.

00:27:25.691 --> 00:27:30.109
If I go to say, to a cemetery, nothing will happen to Me.

00:27:31.733 --> 00:27:35.359
But if a saint catches even a slightest thing,

00:27:35.691 --> 00:27:37.483
that troubles Me, tortures Me,

00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:39.691
not outwardly may be, but inside.

00:27:44.983 --> 00:27:47.983
Because I've given you place in My heart,

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:51.067
in My being, you circulate in My being.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:56.483
That is how I know about you.

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:59.275
So if you really grow better,

00:27:59.608 --> 00:28:01.983
if you improve better

00:28:02.275 --> 00:28:04.691
it will be a thing of joy for you

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.942
and the greatest joy for Me as well,

00:28:07.234 --> 00:28:09.150
that's all I want that you should be,

00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:12.067
nothing else, nothing else.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.359
Now one more assurance I want to give you

00:28:17.691 --> 00:28:22.775
that we are going to start certain projects in India.

00:28:23.025 --> 00:28:24.900
Now the time has come,

00:28:25.192 --> 00:28:27.983
we have acquired some land definitely now

00:28:28.317 --> 00:28:30.317
and we are going to work out

00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:33.525
some projects as soon as I settle down in India,

00:28:33.817 --> 00:28:36.608
we will start showing the manifestation of that.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.608
And maybe this kind of tour

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.400
I may not be able to do after a few years.

00:28:44.691 --> 00:28:48.317
But then you yourself will be able to conduct  these

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.817
tours in your own country, go round

00:28:51.109 --> 00:28:53.983
because this is a training period where you will learn how

00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:55.691
to do this kind of thing.

00:28:56.025 --> 00:28:58.983
Of course in your country it's rather difficult to get such people

00:28:59.317 --> 00:29:02.608
but how to contact: I started with one person.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.691
So I'm just a lady, housewife

00:29:06.983 --> 00:29:09.317
and if I could do it, why not you?

00:29:21.025 --> 00:29:25.858
So now go with a pleasant mind, enjoy yourself.

00:29:27.858 --> 00:29:30.858
It's very difficult for a mother to bear all this because

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.566
when I leave India I feel terrible about the Indians,

00:29:33.858 --> 00:29:35.608
when I leave youI feel terrible about you.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.817
It's something horrible

00:29:36.983 --> 00:29:39.691
that I want that somehow or other we all should have one

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.900
huge country of our own where we all settle down happily together.

00:29:57.025 --> 00:30:01.192
So on behalf of you I would like to thank all the Indians

00:30:01.525 --> 00:30:04.025
who have done so much for us,

00:30:04.317 --> 00:30:07.359
given us all the comfort, according to them it was discomfort

00:30:07.691 --> 00:30:09.275
but according to you it was comfort.

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:30.983
Now you are going on this tour,

00:30:31.275 --> 00:30:32.192
I would request you not to discuss

00:30:32.483 --> 00:30:37.192
other mundane nonsensical things on the way but

00:30:37.483 --> 00:30:39.441
discuss Sahaja Yoga. Understand,

00:30:39.733 --> 00:30:42.359
there are people who are just new, tell them  about Sahaj Yog,

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.608
let them know what is Sahaja Yoga is,

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.359
also explain to them what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.192
You'll be travelling now quite a lot

00:30:51.483 --> 00:30:53.817
and also you'll be going to places where

00:30:53.983 --> 00:30:55.608
we are going to have our projects done.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.858
You can have a look at it, will be a good idea

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:03.150
and also you think about what kind of projects

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:05.359
we can have in this country

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:11.234
which will help them to achieve better results in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:12.109 --> 00:31:14.525
All these we have to discuss

00:31:14.817 --> 00:31:18.525
and this group is much more serious-type,

00:31:18.691 --> 00:31:21.608
I think, and it's going to work out something seriously.

00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:26.858
About the future plans that we would like to have

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:31.067
here and abroad and whatever are the dates and

00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:34.608
things you would like to do. In the month of May, June, July

00:31:34.817 --> 00:31:37.317
I would be in the West and

00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:40.150
May  I would like to keep for America,

00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:43.150
if possible, at least the second half of May.

00:31:43.441 --> 00:31:46.109
The rest of it you can adjust it the way you want to have

00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:49.525
and also arrange your programs among yourselves

00:31:49.817 --> 00:31:51.733
whichever way you say is all right.

00:31:52.067 --> 00:31:55.067
This time it was desired that I should go to Greece,

00:31:55.359 --> 00:31:58.150
I don't mind, I would like to go there and do the needful.

00:32:09.733 --> 00:32:12.817
I hope all the leaders have got the [chains?]

00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:16.025
I have given to Warren.

00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:19.441
All right, it's done now.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.150
I worry about all little, little things like that.

00:32:25.566 --> 00:32:28.359
..............................Marathi............................

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.120
I am just telling them

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.720
with hypocrisy with a double standard you cannot manage Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.040
You cannot cheat yourself, you cannot cheat others.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.820
Cheating is not allowed. If you do cheating,

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.920
you will cheat your Kundalini.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.480
Kundalini knows everything.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.700
[Marathi]

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.480
Leaders should never make importance of their wives or their husbands, not at all.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.580
Otherwise you ruin us completely.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.760
Or we might have to take out a rule that

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.760
nobody who has a wife or a husband is going to be a leader.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.580
One of the two things or children.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.040
It’s terrible it is sometimes.
