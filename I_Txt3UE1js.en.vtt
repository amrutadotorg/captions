00:34.366 --> 00:37.640
(…) So, it’s, I mean in the name of God

00:37.841 --> 00:41.690
ridiculous things were done, ridiculous
things were done.

00:41.891 --> 00:43.955
So he (Buddha) just thought better not talk
about God,

00:44.156 --> 00:47.563
the first step is Self-realisation.

00:47.764 --> 00:49.945
He was a great sahaja yogi I must say.

00:50.146 --> 00:52.687
Because he said, “Nothing doing, don’t
talk about God or anything,

00:52.888 --> 00:55.634
first you get your realisation” -

00:55.853 --> 00:59.173
that was the first condition -
“Establish it.

00:59.374 --> 01:03.546
Unless and until you have established your
realisation, nothing doing.”

01:03.747 --> 01:11.281
So he just started his own method
of propagating buddhi -

01:11.482 --> 01:14.211
Buddha’s knowledge or you can (say)
Buddhism as they call it.

01:14.412 --> 01:16.898
Of course, it became “ism” later on.

01:17.099 --> 01:20.225
So all that he started with the idea

01:20.426 --> 01:23.958
that people should first become Buddha.

01:24.159 --> 01:28.263
Buddha means realised, Buddha is to know.

01:28.464 --> 01:32.077
So Buddha means the person who has known,

01:32.278 --> 01:35.390
means the one who is a realised soul.

01:35.591 --> 01:39.795
So what he says: “Buddham sharanam
gacchami”,

01:39.996 --> 01:42.763
I bow - no, I surrender: sharanam means
surrender -

01:42.964 --> 01:49.336
I surrender to the Buddhas, means to all
the sahaja yogis.

01:50.090 --> 01:53.225
You all are Buddhas because you know.

01:53.426 --> 01:57.110
When you know, you are the Buddha.

02:00.083 --> 02:03.280
(…) When that purity comes, you see,
in our temperament,

02:03.481 --> 02:06.532
that we do everything without any desire,

02:06.733 --> 02:09.827
we have got rid of our ego.

02:10.028 --> 02:14.281
The Buddha is awakened within us. That’s
what is the importance of Buddha:

02:14.482 --> 02:19.639
that he settled down himself in a place
which is the most difficult place,

02:19.840 --> 02:22.718
that is on the left side of your head,
you see.

02:22.919 --> 02:27.327
Sometimes I have seen it projects here up
to this point, you know, in some people.

02:27.528 --> 02:29.514
They get such a terrible pain, you know,

02:29.715 --> 02:32.374
pulling it out from there, can’t imagine.

02:32.575 --> 02:39.156
So this horrible point which is, so funny
it is,

02:39.357 --> 02:42.077
sometimes it can blow up like that you see,

02:42.278 --> 02:45.624
sometimes it can pierce through;
it’s a horrible one

02:45.825 --> 02:48.670
which all of you have developed
quite a lot, you see,

02:48.871 --> 02:52.163
and it takes its forms in different ways
and methods.

02:52.364 --> 02:57.983
For that we have to say “Buddham
sharanam gacchami”,

02:58.184 --> 03:02.733
means we surrender ourselves to Buddha.

03:03.167 --> 03:06.077
Then what does he say, the second one
is very good:

03:06.278 --> 03:09.015
“Sangham sharanam gacchami”,

03:09.216 --> 03:11.907
I surrender myself to collectivity,
sangham.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.514
Sangha is the collectivity.

03:14.715 --> 03:18.499
I surrender myself to collectivity.
Ego goes down.

03:18.700 --> 03:21.890
First of all, Buddha who is the king,
who is the deity

03:22.091 --> 03:27.547
which is the enlightenment, you say:
“I surrender myself to Buddha.”

03:28.130 --> 03:32.827
Secondly, you say: “I surrender myself
to collectivity”.

03:33.028 --> 03:36.711
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

03:37.795 --> 03:43.592
So “I surrender myself to collectivity”,
so we say:

03:44.090 --> 03:48.188
“Sangham sharanam gacchami”.

03:49.941 --> 03:55.990
It is to Virat we are doing.

03:56.191 --> 03:58.816
What is the third one? “Buddham
sharanam gacchami,

03:59.017 --> 04:00.356
Sangham sharanam gacchami”.

04:00.588 --> 04:04.300
The third one… “Dhammam sharanam gacchami.”

04:04.501 --> 04:05.745
“Dhammam sharanam gacchami.”

04:05.946 --> 04:09.082
Dhammam means the religion, the balance.

04:09.283 --> 04:13.460
I surrender myself to religion which is
essence of it.

04:13.661 --> 04:17.874
Or you can put it the other way round that:
“Buddham sharanam gacchami,

04:18.075 --> 04:22.522
Dhammam sharanam gacchami, Sangham
sharanam gacchami.”

04:22.739 --> 04:29.622
That’s all if you have achieved it, then we
can talk of God, not before.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.652
So these three things are to be achieved.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.144
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way
like this.

04:36.345 --> 04:40.011
First of all “Dhammam sharanam gacchami,”

04:40.619 --> 04:45.076
I surrender myself to my virtues.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.331
All desires can be surrendered to your
virtue.

04:49.532 --> 04:52.450
Is it virtuous to do like this?

04:52.651 --> 04:55.175
You can, if you are brought up that way
you’ll just not do it;

04:55.376 --> 04:59.089
you’ll have no desires to do something that
is not virtuous and righteous.

04:59.290 --> 05:00.979
You’ll just not do it.

05:01.180 --> 05:04.136
So “Dhammam sharanam gacchami.”

05:04.337 --> 05:06.363
Then you should say: “Buddham sharanam
gacchami”,

05:06.564 --> 05:09.620
means “I surrender myself to my
enlightenment”.

05:09.821 --> 05:12.823
This is the second state when you are
ascended.

05:13.024 --> 05:17.904
“Surrender myself to enlightenment.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.849
Enlightenment that I have got to my Spirit,

05:22.050 --> 05:24.162
is the Spirit who is going to guide me.”

05:24.363 --> 05:29.582
No more my physical, mental, emotional
nonsensical temptations,

05:29.783 --> 05:32.605
but what is the Spirit.

05:32.806 --> 05:35.629
And thirdly, “Sangham sharanam gacchami”

05:35.830 --> 05:40.324
to the collectivity, to the whole,
to the Virat.

05:40.525 --> 05:43.228
This is the way we have to work it out.

05:43.429 --> 05:49.588
So ultimately reach the same point: that
let me start it from myself.

05:49.789 --> 05:54.656
From myself to others, not from others
to myself.

05:54.857 --> 05:59.937
It’s like treating the tree from outside,
not from the roots.

06:00.138 --> 06:02.641
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

06:02.842 --> 06:05.922
First you get your realisation, alright?

06:06.123 --> 06:12.328
Then learn how to surrender yourself
to your dharma.

06:13.215 --> 06:17.039
Then you become collectively conscious.

06:17.918 --> 06:20.905
Collectivity is a temperament,

06:21.106 --> 06:27.593
is a sense of enjoyment that you get
in the collective living.

06:27.794 --> 06:34.968
Unless and until you have that you have
not achieved your joy.

06:37.982 --> 06:44.218
So Buddha has played a very great role
in our lives

06:44.419 --> 06:49.041
and he is a very great, powerful force
within us.

06:51.357 --> 06:53.830
(…) Ego is the only problem I always face,

06:54.030 --> 06:55.578
reaching their hearts.

06:55.779 --> 06:59.908
If ego is removed everything will be
alright.

07:00.109 --> 07:06.139
So for us the great mantra is: “Buddham
sharanam gacchami.”

07:06.340 --> 07:10.733
These three mantras you must say
every day, I think,

07:10.934 --> 07:15.387
to get rid of this horrible ego.

07:15.941 --> 07:27.370
“Buddham sharanam gacchami”

07:27.571 --> 07:39.248
“Dhammam sharanam gacchami”

07:39.449 --> 07:50.108
“Sangham sharanam gacchami”

07:50.309 --> 07:59.957
“Shri Mā sharanam gacchami”

08:00.262 --> 08:10.867
“Shri Mā sharanam gacchami”
