00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.040
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:13.480
I’ve told you yesterday that truth is what it is.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.440
We cannot conceptualize it,

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.960
we cannot imagine it

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.520
and we cannot know it with our human awareness.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.200
So we have to become a subtler being

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.720
that we have to become the Spirit.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:17:00.200
Only when we become the Spirit then we will understand that

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.240
this whole creation is looked after

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.360
by a very subtle power of love of God Almighty.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.120
Very good.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:42.880
So to become a subtler being, within us is placed a mechanism

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.280
about which we told you yesterday.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.040
Today I want to tell you about this power

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.720
which achieves the state of Spirit and about the Spirit.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:28.320
This power resides in the Sacrum, in the triangular bone

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:42.320
and is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:02.680
while the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in our heart.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:26.080
The Spirit is the one which is just watching,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.000
like God Almighty.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.400
And the Power of God Almighty,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.520
His power of desire,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.560
is the Holy Ghost,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.760
is the Primordial Mother.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:06.040
They talk of Father the God, Son the God,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.680
and nothing about the Mother.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:21.560
How can you have Father and Son and no Mother?

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.120
But they avoided somehow,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.960
I don’t know for what reason, to talk of the Primordial Mother.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.440
But in all other scriptures

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:52.160
there is a description of the Primordial Mother, like Athena.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.360
Atha in Sanskrit means the Primordial.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.120
But even if they did not mention Christ’s Mother as a Goddess

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.880
still the people on their own, with the feeling

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.760
and with their background of the Pagan religion called Her Madonna.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.040
But She was not called as Madonna in the Bible.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.040
Now this Primordial Mother is expressed

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.480
is expressed or is reflected as this Kundalini.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:02.320
And this Kundalini is your individual mother.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.160
And She knows each and everything about you.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.560
Many people have said that Kundalini-awakening can harm you.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.080
How can you think that

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.240
Kundalini can harm you when She is your mother?

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.520
When you were born your mother took over

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.200
all the problems of your birth.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.400
She did not trouble you.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.960
In the same way, when this Kundalini is awakened,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:24.200
She gives you this second birth without giving you any trouble.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.840
So, we have to understand that

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:47.760
this Mother Earth cannot give us any trouble

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.080
when She sprouts the seeds,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.520
in the same way this Mother Kundalini doesn’t give us any trouble.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:17.560
The Spirit is the reflection of the God Almighty in all of us

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:31.200
As there is only one God all of us reflect the same,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:43.360
and so we are collectively conscious when we become the Spirit.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.520
So everyone has the Spirit reflected in his heart.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:09.480
So when you feel this Cool Breeze as you felt the other day,

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:17.720
what you feel is this allpervading power.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.920
At the same time you become collectively conscious.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.240
So you can feel another person also on your fingertips.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.800
In the Koran Mohammed Sahib has said,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.640
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.760
And this is the resurrection time.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.800
This is the last judgement.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.520
And you have to judge yourself.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.960
The other day in Holland one person asked Me,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.640
“Mother, how is it that

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.800
some people will be saved and some will not be?"

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.680
I said, “It is destiny."

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:56.160
Maybe those who are here have done such righteous things

00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.320
in previous lives and in this life that they are here.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.640
It depends, I don’t know how.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:23.000
In Russia for example, I have to always book a big stadium.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.520
For example there is a place called Togliatti

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.520
and this gentleman Togliatti was actually Italian.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:53.000
And he revolted against the Christian church and went to Russia.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.920
And there he started a big factory for making motorcars.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.480
Now there are 40.000 Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.600
I’ve not been there as yet.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.880
And on My birthday they had a holiday for the whole city.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.280
I can’t understand why in some places

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.040
it works tremendously in a big way,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.440
many people come to Sahaja Yoga

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.000
and in some places there are very few people.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.720
As I told you, when this Kundalini rises

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.200
then you improve physically.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.880
Now, I must say many diseases have been cured

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.080
as a by-product of Kundalini-awakening.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:45.760
We have three Indian doctors who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.120
for curing incurable diseases.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.880
And there are seven doctors in England

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.800
who are recording all those who have been cured.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:17.040
But in Moscow there are 40 doctors who are practizing Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.200
Because for this you don’t need a hospital, you don't need money,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.120
you don’t need anything.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.080
It is your own power that works.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.000
And once you are properly established,

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.480
then you don’t have to worry about your health at all.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.480
It also helps for mentally retarded people, mentally sick people.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:17.360
Because this Kundalini, when She rises She is also a redeemer.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.600
She nourishes the centers.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.240
By that nourishment the centers get cured

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.120
and ultimately She integrates all these centers.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:55.080
The Spirit, when it shines in your attention,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.120
then your attention becomes enlightened.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.840
Means if you can pay attention to anyone

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.320
and try to feel what centers are in problem in that person,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.560
you can immediately feel it.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:32.840
There are many criminals from India who came to west countries

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:41.280
wearing these orange dresses and became false masters.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.480
Some of them also knew how to mesmerize very well

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:05.600
and they have lynched people because main interest was money.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.480
Of course there are also other so-called masters

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.800
in other countries also,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.600
even a person like Freud.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.320
He was anti-Christ, you can see it clearly.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.400
Because Christ had said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,”

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:55.360
such a subtle description of purity.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.160
Such a subtle description of puritiy.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:15.240
But on the other hand this Mister Freud

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.280
has made everyone into nothing but a sex point.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.640
And the people have lost understanding

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.800
that these are the human weaknesses.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:50.760
To such an extent they have been misled that they say

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:57.320
that you can ascend in your spirituality through sex.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.040
This is absurd!

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.080
On the contrary, in the Christian dogmas

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.520
people believe that you should abhor sex.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.880
This is both are absolutely absurd.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.600
One has to have a sane attitude.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.680
If you see it clearly, the lowest center which we call as Mooladhara

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.720
is placed below the Kundalini.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:14.880
Now this center looks after our excretion, including sex.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.440
So your ascent has nothing to do with sex.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.040
On the contrary, when your Kundalini starts awakening

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.880
you become innocent like a child.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.880
And that is what Christ has said, that

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.760
you have to become like children to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.560
So it is Sahaja Yoga which really explains Christ

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.440
and practizes Christianity.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.200
Moreover, the breaking of the Sahasrara,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.440
which is what we call is the fontanel bone area,

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.280
is actualization of the baptism.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.800
You may follow any religion, Hindu, Christian, Muslim, any religion,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.440
you can do any sin, you can commit any sin, there is no restriction.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.040
There is no restricition from within.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:10.280
But once you become a sahaja yogi, I don’t have to tell you anything.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.080
You just become righteous.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.080
I don’t have to tell you Ten Commandments,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.360
you just do it yourself.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.640
You become your own master

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.600
and you guide yourself.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.200
And you know the absolute truth.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.880
You can get ten children who are realized souls and tie their eyes

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.880
and put one person in front of those children

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.320
and ask them, “What’s wrong with this gentleman?”

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.760
and they will put up the same finger.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.240
And you ask him, “Is something wrong with his throat?”

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.760
And he says, “Yes, but how do you know?”

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.040
Because this finger indicates the throat.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.880
So, these false gurus who have come here,

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.800
the falsehood that they have taught – you can feel it.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.680
You can feel if they are crooks, if they are false,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.360
if they are deceiving you.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.080
First of all you should know that you cannot pay for your ascent,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.160
because it is an evolutionary process,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:51.280
which is living process,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.400
for which you cannot pay.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.360
And then you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.680
And then you become joy.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.320
Not the wrong type of joy,

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.320
but joy that elevates you,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.320
sublimates you.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:37.000
Joy does not have happiness and unhappiness like two sides of a coin.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.320
That means joy is absolute,

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.880
but pleasures are not.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.080
When you indulge into any pleasure it has a reaction,

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.840
it has a repercussion,

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.640
but joy is absolute.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:26.400
So, yesterday all of you who were here, most of you felt the Spirit

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.840
because you could feel the cool breeze.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.640
So the growth has started

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:51.200
and hardly you’ll take a month to master it.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.880
But you have to work it out

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:08.760
because the connection has to be all right.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.000
Maybe there are some problems within the being

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.440
which need to be corrected

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.880
So it would be very nice

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.160
if you people attend their follow-on and meet them

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.440
But the whole thing works in collectivity.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:53.560
See, at the time of Buddha they had to do all kind of penances,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.240
cleansing, absolute renunciations.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.560
Still they could not achieve their Self-Realization.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.080
Buddha also had to suffer a lot

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.800
in His cleansing.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:22.600
But in Sahaja Yoga it is the collectivity

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.200
which cleanses you automatically.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Corrects you, yes.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:40.400
Now supposing there’s something wrong with this left hand

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.560
so the right hand immediately helps it,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.840
automatically,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.000
because they are part and parcel of one body.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.200
In Sahaja Yoga you have become part and parcel of the whole.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.080
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.760
So now you can only grow when you are with that body.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:38.040
Supposing My nail is cut from My body – it won’t grow.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.640
In the beginning you will find little difficult

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.600
to adjust to collectivity

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.440
you may find that it’s not very congenial for you, maybe.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:06.160
Not with everyone, but some people do fuss about it.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.520
And the door of Sahaja Yoga is open to everyone,

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.880
sometimes we also get mad people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.360
Then you start thinking, “How this mad man is here?”

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.880
and all that, you start criticizing.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:41.600
But if you take to introspection, then it will be excellent for you

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.480
and not to worry about others,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.640
you will grow much faster.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:01.600
For you are the seed, you are the Mother Earth

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.880
and you are the gardener.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.800
And you are the love that is water.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.760
So as it is, I’ve told you, all you have Divinity,

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.400
only thing you have to feel and grow into it.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.840
Yesterday nobody asked Me any questions, it was such a good sign

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.280
that you all want your Realization, that’s all.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.040
Then I told you that asking questions is just a mental acrobats.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.240
Now, I can answer all your questions,

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.280
but – that is no guarantee for Self-Realization.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.440
Only thing, you must have the pure desire,

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.120
pure desire to be the Spirit.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.600
Then it works,

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.120
because the Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.400
As you know all other desires are in general not satiable.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:11.000
This is the only desire which gives you real satisfaction.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.880
Thank you very much!

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:30.400
So, are you going to ask Me any question today?

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:05.520
What's it?

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:08.960
He wants to know about the appearance of Holy Mary,

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.320
for example in Fatima or in other places.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.800
Might have, it’s quite possible, you see one of My photographs,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.240
where people are taking photographs – and She’s there,

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.240
She’s appeared before Me also, it’s possible.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.280
You must see some of My photographs,

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.160
it’s interesting how these apparitions come in.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.800
All right? It’s possible.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.880
But unfortunately She’s described as just a woman in the Bible,

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.280
I mean there’s no respect for Her.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.160
Must be Paul who must have done it, because he was just an organizer

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:08.720
and I think he wanted to use Christianity as a platform for himself.

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.960
And he had nothing to do with Christ, you see on the contrary

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.760
he killed one of the disciples of Christ, Steven, he killed him.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.240
He must have thought it’s a very good way of getting a platform

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.840
so he must have jumped on the platform.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.080
Or might be to make some money.

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.320
We, too,  get sometimes such people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.040
What to do?

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.600
But he was not a realized soul, nothing of that kind.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.800
Sahaja Yoga will explain everything,

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.400
the relationship of Christ with others.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.280
Christ has said, “Those who are not against Me are with Me.”

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.040
Who are those?

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.960
Actually Christ was there till eight years of age,

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:50.640
and then He went to India. For twenty years He was there.

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.640
When He came back He lived only for three and a half years.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.560
And they crucified Him.

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:16.440
I mean, whatever He has done is tremendous in three and a half years.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:26.720
He just used ordinary fishermen and did such a lot of preaching

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:37.560
about truth, very forcingly He talked about truth, courageously.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:46.120
But three and a half years is nothing!

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.360
In England I was struggling with seven hippies for four years,

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:57.800
I had to give them Realization, struggling for four years!

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.040
They had no background at all

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:19.680
And they are now, I feel, they were following Freud, not Christ.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.640
It was such a shock to see.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.720
All right,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.080
so it will take us ten, fifteen minutes for us to get to that state.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.800
I have to just request you to take out your shoes,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.360
to take the help of the Mother Earth.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:42.480
One thing I have to tell you, that Self-Realization cannot be forced.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:56.080
You have to ask for it in your own glory of freedom,

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:06.480
because ultimately you have to achieve the complete freedom,

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.920
complete mastery of yourself,

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.080
where no addiction,

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.040
no habits,

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:30.360
no false gurus, nobody can dominate you.

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:47.320
So those who do not want to have their Self-Realization should please leave.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:58.520
Come and sit, there are chairs here, come and sit here.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.640
No use standing, please be seated.

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.880
All of you should be seated will be good idea.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:20.080
You shouldn’t stand and watch others, it is not civil.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:06.480
Now, please try to understand what you have to do,

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.560
and we’ll show you that,

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.880
after that you have to close your eyes.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.800
There are two powers within us, left one the power of desire

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.080
and the right one the power of action.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.720
So we put our left hand like this on our lap, very comfortably.

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:59.520
You should not sit with a slouch or a stretch on your body,

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:03.840
but just a straight comfortable pose.

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:16.760
Those who are sitting on the ground are perfectly all right,

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.720
they should just take out their shoes.

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:28.720
Those who are sitting on the chair

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.840
both the feet away from each other.

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.200
So we use the left hand

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:48.760
to express that we desire to have Self-Realization.

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:04.440
And we use the right hand to nourish our centers.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.760
So first we put our right hand on our heart

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.560
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.800
Please put it on your heart. You don't understand?

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:49.360
Now, here resides the Spirit.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.880
Now, you take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:04.640
where is the center of your mastery.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.040
When you are the Spirit, you are your master.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.280
So now, please take your right hand

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.160
in the lower portion of your abdomen -

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.960
everything on the left side -

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.800
because this is the center of pure knowledge.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.600
Then we raise our right hand again

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.440
on the upper portion of our abdomen.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:06.520
Then we take our right hand on the heart.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.240
Then we take our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.280
and we turn our head to our right.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.960
This center is spoiled when we feel guilty

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:38.720
and as a result we get horrible diseases like angina.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.120
So please don’t feel guilty!

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.520
Then we take our right hand on our forehead across,

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.520
forehead across like this, and put down your head,

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.000
as far as possible.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.400
Why don’t you do it? Please.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.440
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:36.000
Now please take back your right hand on the back side of your head

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.080
and push back your head.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.040
This is the center where - without feeling guilty,

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.280
without counting your mistakes -

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.120
you have to ask for forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.520
Now stretch your palm fully

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.400
and put the center of your palm on top of your head

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520
and now press it hard.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:36.040
Push back your fingers and put down your head.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.720
Now move your scalp slowly seven times – scalp!

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.200
That’s all we have to do.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.280
But there are three conditions.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.080
The first one is

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:29.840
that you have to be absolutely self-confident about yourself

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.560
that you will get your Self-Realization.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.600
Whether you have come late or earlier, makes no difference.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:58.000
The second one is to forget your past at this point,

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.960
you have to be in the present

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.800
so that you do not feel guilty.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.600
After all you are a human being, you are not God.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.000
If you have done any mistakes – it’s all right.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.800
This Divine power is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:51.480
And whatever mistakes you commited,

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:55.680
it can be dissolved by the power.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.360
That means you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.320
and you should have respect for yourself
because you are a human being,

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.320
because you are the epitome of evolution.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.880
Only thing, the last breakthrough has to take place.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.400
So don’t feel guilty at all at this moment.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.400
The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.720
As I told you yesterday, wether

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.360
you forgive or don’t forgive - you don’t do anything.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.680
That is just mental.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:19.120
And if you do not forgive others,

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.320
you play into wrong hands unnecessarily.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.520
And you torture yourself

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.880
while the one who has troubled you is very happy.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.920
Just say, “I forgive everyone in general”

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.720
and you’ll feel immediately lighter in you head.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:04.160
These are the only three conditions.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.320
Now please close your eyes

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.720
and please do not open them till I tell you.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.840
So put the right hand on your heart

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.480
and left hand towards Me like this

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.680
and both the feet apart from each other.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.440
Now, here is the center of your Spirit.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.400
Please close your eyes and ask Me a fundamental question,

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.240
you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like,

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:38.480
Here you ask Me a fundamental question three times in your heart,

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.560
"“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:10:56.280 --> 01:11:02.400
If you are the Spirit you are your guide.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.640
So now please take your hand

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.560
on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.400
and press it hard.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.640
Here you have to ask another question to Me,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.280
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.520
Three times.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.520
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.320
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you,

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.760
which does all the Divine work.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.040
So please put your right hand

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.560
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:25.520
And here you have to ask six times,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.640
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.480
Six times.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.160
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.320
the Kundalini starts moving upward,

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:21.360
so we have to nourish the upper centers

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.080
with our full self-confidence.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.080
So now please raise your right hand

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.240
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.400
and here, with full confidence, say ten times,

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:53.720
“Mother, I am my own master!”

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.280
I’ve already told you that you are the pure Spirit.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.480
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.160
you are not this ego, this conditioning,

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.080
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.360
So now please raise your right hand on your heart.

01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.600
Here you have to say

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.240
with full confidence in yourself twelve times,

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.600
“Mother, I am the Spirit!”

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:12.040
This all-pervading power is the ocean of love and compassion,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:19.360
it is the ocean of absolute knowledge,

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.760
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.280
So whatever mistake you might have committed,

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.040
it can easily dissolve all of it.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.720
So now, here you raise your right hand

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.600
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.640
and turn your head to your right.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.320
And here you have to say with full confidence sixteen times,

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.520
“Mother, I am not guilty at all!”

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.160
I’ve already told you whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.120
you don’t do anything.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:11.760
This center is so constricted

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:18.760
that, please, you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.880
If you don’t forgive you may not get your Realization.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.680
So now please, raise your right hand on your forehead across

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.680
and put down your head fully.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:55.160
Here you have to say with full confidence

01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.840
you have to just say, don’t say it is difficult,

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:07.120
“Mother, I forgive everyone!”

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:34.040
You have to say it from your heart, not how many times.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.360
Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.320
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.440
Here you have to say,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.840
without feeling guilty,

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.840
without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:34.520
“Mother, if I have done any mistakes, or all-pervading power,

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:38.720
if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.840
“All-pervading power,” you should say.

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.400
Now please stretch your hand, stretch your palm,

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.720
and put the center of your palm

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.520
just on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:28.880
and put down your head and press it hard by pushing out your fingers.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:46.240
Here again I cannot cross over your freedom,

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.920
so you have to ask for your Self-Realization.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.040
Now please put down your head,

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.720
push back your fingers nicely,

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.520
and move your scalp seven times slowly, saying,

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.560
“Mother, please give me my Self-Realization.”

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:39.000
Please put down your head, please put down your head,

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.320
If you don’t bend, it won’t work out.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.560
Please move your scalp seven times,

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.440
saying, “Mother, please give me Self-Realization.” (Shri Mataji bläst ins Mikro).

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.880
Please take down your hands, please open your eyes.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:09.360
Now please put both your hands like this.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:19.880
Now bend your head and see for yourself,

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.000
if there is a Cool Breeze coming out of your head or hot breeze,

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:27.240
if you have not forgiven it will be hot breeze.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.400
But please don’t put your hand on top of your head,

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.800
little away and see for yourself.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.080
Now please put your left hand and see for yourself

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.320
with your right hand.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.760
If it is hot air that means you have to forgive.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.400
Now put the right hand again please

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:44.120
and see with the left hand.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.320
Now put both your hands towards the sky

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.320
and ask anyone of these questions,

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.600
“Mother, is this the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.520
Mother, is this the All-pervading power of God’s Love?

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.360
Mother, is this the Paramchaitanya?”

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:18.200
Anyone of these you can ask three times – questions.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:47.040
Now please take down your hands.

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:53.320
Put your hands like this towards Me.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.000
Watch Me without thinking.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.120
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.080
out of their head or on their hands or fingertips,

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.800
please raise both your hands.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:51.240
I bow to all of you, you’re the saints.

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.440
I know some people did not feel it,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:01.720
very few,

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.880
doesn’t matter.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.160
Those who want to meet Me are welcome,

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.920
but the Sahaja Yogis should not come.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:22.840
Those who have not felt should come on this side

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.480
and sahaja yogis will work on them.
