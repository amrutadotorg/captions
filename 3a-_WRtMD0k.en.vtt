00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.900
For the flowers?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.340
This is mummy has done for you? It's very sweet one.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.300
This one is?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.580
Wood.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.140
No, no, no, it started now. You see a little bit of...

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.020
Just the thing that we feed.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.740
See these flowers.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.700
Are they nice?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.180
The flowers...

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.900
Are they nice flowers?

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.940
Such a smiling baby.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.540
Such a sweet baby.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.060
Such a nice baby.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.340
You must smile.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.340
You must smile.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.020
Are they still like a nervous person? And...

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.500
What's the Mishon's daughter's name is?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.380
Marina.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.700
Marina.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.020
Marina, ha.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.260
She also looses a little bit of her balance, with aarti.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.500
Yeah. Very good.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.580
You are feeling sleepy.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.860
Very quiet, ah?

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.540
She's very good Mother.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.340
She's very quiet.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.380
Even Pauline's daughter has improved a lot.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.500
Good.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.460
Very much better now, very much better.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.500
William's [apetite is] very much by this..

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.780
I think that work would suit him the best.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.140
He did a very good job in our house, you see...

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.420
And C.P. liked his things that he had cooked and made Me happy..

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.420
I had such a problem, I didn't know what to do because you see it's,

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.620
C.P. won't eat anything and I thought now to give up and go away.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.820
But who told Me was [Pray].

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.380
She said, "William is a very good cook, if he can help there."

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.180
I thought, "If he's working, how will he do it?"

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.460
But he did it very well.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.540
You see, Mr. Srivastava eats very little, but

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.420
if it is good, tasty food then he'll eat, all right.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.860
She's feeling sleepy now.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.820
Feeling sleepy?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.980
All right?

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.260
You don't smile at all, isn't it?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.540
And then it is enough to put a lipstick [unclear] completely.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.620
All right, all right.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.900
All right, now, just do it.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.900
Crawls? Does she? Does she crawl a little?

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.700
Yes, Mother, she does.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.580
Now, gone away.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.020
From the distance, smiling.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.180
What's  her age now?

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.299
She's eight months old.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.700
Slowly, she'll sit down upon you.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.060
But she's now a very sweet child, I must say.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.020
She doesn't trouble at all.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.420
In the beginning you had problems,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.140
Yes, a lot.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.260
Because you have comitted some mistakes I think, about her.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.220
You didn't know.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.060
But you are rather thin now. What's the problem?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.540
You are nursing her?

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.100
Yes, Mother.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.620
And no other milk?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.300
No, I haven't been using other milk.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.020
I've been travelling so much that I haven't had time to do it.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.940
Travelling where? To Exeter?

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.180
Yes, Mother.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.580
How is it? They have got an ashram now in Exeter?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.180
Devon town at least.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.740
No, another one.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.780
Or somebody told Me, very near.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.780
What's her name? The one with a pink frock who came?

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.900
Oh, Carol.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.900
No, no, no.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.340
Carol's friend I think, the one who came with a pink frock to Loose.

00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:39.420
What's her name?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.740
Carol, Carol, Mother.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.100
She, she's also Carol?

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.580
Yes, that's Carol.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.420
She lives in Totnes.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.740
She said Dartington.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.380
That's right.Yes.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.780
And she said she has,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.900
they have got an ashram there now, in that place. Good idea.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.700
They are very good.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.660
They are very good.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.300
So, she said now there are three, three persons only,

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.780
but she hopes to get more.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.420
Sahaja Yoga grows you see very slowly, no doubt about it,

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.260
but it's better to have solid people than to have half baked.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.700
You know I'm very thankful to you, you solved really My problem.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.660
You don't know I would have given up,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.260
and I would have come back, really.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.980
Chance to you.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.980
[It's a bit short], please eat your food and....

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.420
You liked the Italians. They are very interesting people.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.340
Very interesting.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.500
I'll be coming to Italy in, I think, september or so.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.180
There, I start from the 24-th of August,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.180
till the fifteenth of September or fourteenth of September,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.900
my journey in Switzerland, Austria and Italy, these three countries.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.020
I don't know how Gregoire has put it

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.700
but I will also get the whole program here.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.660
But, you have got your passport?

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.500
I'll go and get it.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:44.060
It's, it's in my thing, I packed it away with...

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.020
Where?

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.380
In Sally's house.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.900
Oh, I see. And yours?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.500
She's keeping my things.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.700
I've got my passport.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.420
You have got it. Yours is there.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.940
You don't have to have a passport yourself,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.260
you have to have a visa, that's all.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.900
I don't know.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.660
You don't have to ask for visa?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.420
I don't think so. I've got an Irish passport, Mother.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.940
No, but you have to take visa to get to Italy and Europe.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.100
All of you, isn't it?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.740
So they don't even need a passport.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.700
To go to Italy?

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.620
No, no. It's in Common Market so no visa is necessary.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.260
Irish is also in Common Market, Mother, so she's at safe. No problem.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.820
No problem?

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.380
Then when are you going?

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.260
We have to wait for Isabel and Guido to tell us when we should go.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.140
But I have already written to them.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.980
Well, we can't escape what they are making in Hampstead, Mother.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.660
We can't escape what they are making in Hampstead, on 31-st, and then

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.140
as soon as we can get it running after that we'll go.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.740
So [with our ladies taking up] we can settle.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.820
No, the letter I have seen,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.780
saying that they want immediately Sahaja Yogis there.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.500
So why don't you telephone and find out?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.740
Gilbert mentioned that he telephoned last night or the night before

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.740
and Isabel said she would talk to Guido,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.940
because we have a child. So...

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.780
No, but tell them that Mother said that she, it's all right.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.060
Yes.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.580
All right?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.340
Yes.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.460
Gilbert? Should I tell Gilbert?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.900
Gilbert? No it's not neccessary.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.260
Will you please tell her to telephone to these people in Italy, yeah?

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.500
But Pedro it's there. I'll tell Pedro.

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.220
Would You like to meet him Mother? Would You like to meet him now?

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.380
No I will tell that to Guruji.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.620
It's not there.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.700
Instead I hope you were not dissapointed with the number.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.780
But I think they must have gone to see the match.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.060
Or might be seeing it on the TV.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.780
Yes.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.900
Their priorities are very wrong and thank God they lost it.

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:53.620
Oh. Four-zero, four-zero.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.860
Oh, no.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.060
Good.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.740
It could teach Robson a lesson Mother. He can't goes on it.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.220
Who can't go?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.540
Robson.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.380
He's lost for PP, Mother.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.460
He gambled with his teacher?

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.860
No, with, with friends at school.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.020
He should have asked Me.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.380
Forgive their confidence, Mother.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.140
And ask the vibrations.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.860
Even I am here why do you think they had to go?

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.340
So they had to loose.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.820
I think tomorrow you might get more people.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.180
Give a bandhan to all the Brighton seekers.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.700
Ten times. Come forward, come forward, come forward, all of you.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.580
Their priorities are wrong.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.140
I don't know when will they be all right.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.460
When they are going to hear Your voice

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.540
and see Your picture, Mother, maybe then.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.580
Maybe when they are going to hear Your voice and see Your picture,

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.100
maybe then their priorities will be right.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.860
I don't know.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.100
You see, London is a difficult place and that's it.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.500
But England is even worse. Even worse, you know.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.380
But the other places like Austria, now just imagine.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.860
I have been there only once.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.860
We had seventy people for the Puja.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.940
Seventy people came for the Sahasrar Puja.

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:43.380
Now, this place Geneva, sixty-five people.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.660
I mean for Puja we have very limited number or

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.460
very selected people, you know.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.460
And sixty-five.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.860
Can you believe it? Geneva itself. Then Laussanne, it's all separate.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.020
You can imagine?

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.940
They are so sluggish, these people.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:03.900
Very sluggish.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.460
They are seekers no doubt.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.540
Very sluggish seekers.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.500
Moreover they are attacked, so much, so much attacked.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.460
And this left sided attack is so much.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.540
My thing was so full of it, I tell you.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.700
When I came all My this foot it didn't allow Me to walk.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.740
It was so caught up all this left side.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.300
So many things like that are happening in Brighton, I think.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.700
And the whole left is absolutely caught up.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.860
It started from, of course, Victoria.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.380
But here when I got down, this is the problem,

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.020
really stumbling the left.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.220
Mother, in university we had so many false gurus,

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.580
and there are some brothers that followed them,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.820
who [managed] the things and who tried to get...

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.220
Now they have run away, all of their students.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.500
Well there are buddhists in the campus and [unclear] to get it.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.540
They'll take them to Shambala. Buddhists.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.260
And then they are taking tea among Life Poet whole center.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.980
[There is tea guy?]

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.300
Yes. And Life Poet.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.500
Life Poet, Mother, it's an offshoot of that Raktabija fellow.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.140
What are [they doing]?

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.300
They've got some guru that they send in the

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.500
East or somewhere, of Malayesia...

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.180
His name is Klaus or something.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.700
What did you say? I didn't hear...

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.380
He is, he is, I think he is named like Derek Klaus or something...

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.220
Derek what?

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.380
He's Herbert, Herbert Job.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.860
So however he's called Mother, he's horrid. Herbert Job.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.980
She's like Olympia, see. From very childhood Olympia was like this.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.380
You are hungry. It's good.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.540
So all these are taking you know, a [deed] from Indians.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.180
They think why not we also have an entreprise, you see.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.020
But I was told that

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.340
in England people don't take Indian people very seriously.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.260
I'm sorry, I can't give you this. You don't have teeth to eat that.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.380
Gregoire was saying that, what we should do.

00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:54.300
We should get Indian Sahaja Yogis for England.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.820
We should send English Sahaja Yogis for India.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.740
It's like that.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.700
What's this?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.340
You can just put it that way.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.940
No, I use the hands sometimes, see.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.740
This?

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.460
A little.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.340
Whatever you may say, you see, so whatever goes on like that.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:37.700
But serious Sahaja Yogis we get, is better than to have too many.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.460
They are much better.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.260
Have serious Sahaja Yogis who get into it, who settle down,

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.940
than to have too many people in the program.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.740
We had so many before also, you see.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.500
All sorts of things. How many came out of that?

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.780
Cause in any case even if you get hundreds,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.380
out of that only, say, you will get about ten.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.580
So why not have the ten?

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.500
That's real economics, here.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.180
That's real economics.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.020
Yes, it's real economics is.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.980
So what's the use?  I'm wasting your energy with them.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.420
You see, they are so many, so you waste more energy with them.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:14.980
And they are all useless.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.100
Can't take them anywhere.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.620
So what's the use of fighting with them, useless people.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.300
And their Kundalini rising after ten years,

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.700
like a mountain to raise they've given us.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.660
But not in India. In India it's very good.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.980
I mean if there are hundred persons at least ninety will turn right.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.780
But if I have it here, ten.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.420
This is the proportion.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.260
That's why in India it is growing like that.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.100
Everytime, even if I go to them or not.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.460
I find about fifty, sixty people, like that.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.140
Everytime, can you imagine?

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.300
In Bombay, of course, much more.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.540
Bombay has got I think seven or eight centers all together.

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:11.860
In the Bombay city itself, very well running.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.660
Which is so much so, that now, for the program we had,

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.220
My birthday program,

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.300
we had and the big hall was having

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.540
about twelve hudred to fifteen hundred people.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.300
It was so filled that outside when I did arrive,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.340
that they asked Me to arrive little later,

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.260
I couldn't go in. It was, people had to push side.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.820
And when My brothers came little later,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.940
they said, "We just didn't know how are we going, to whom."

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.180
Then one third they were,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.060
many more seniors ones, all were Sahaja Yogis practically.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.820
But we had invited about three to four hundred people extra.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.980
They all were there, on the first seat.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:13.460
And the Deputee Minister, Deputee Chief Minister was present there.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.660
But you won't know they have, you see, just like as you have here,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:23.060
Peter Shore and all that, they have very important leaders, you see.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.700
Comunist Party, then we have one very extreme party called Shiv Sena,

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.020
which is a fanatic party of Shivaji's, fanatic party.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.940
I mean I'd rather difficult I think to eat this one.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.380
It's not breaking.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.980
Would You like a knife Mother?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.500
[No, it's all right].

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.220
I'm not very good at all these things, I think.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.900
It's not breaking at all but I'll manage. Managed, managed, managed.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.140
[Hindi]

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.460
And all these people, extremes, all kinds of extremes,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:15.380
then all kinds of these leaders, members of the Assembly and all that.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.940
some ministers, all have come,

00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:25.140
and sitting on the same platform, can you imagine,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.580
for My birthday.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.380
And the greatest position, you must have heard, in India, is pandit.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.780
[unclear]

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.860
And he didn't take any money.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.660
He said, "For Mother's birthday I'm not going to take any money".

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.260
That kind of an attitude sure you can't expect here.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.260
Of course not.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.540
But you'll be amazed, in India, how many days I've worked, you know.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.580
I started, say in 1970, may. Slowly everything grew.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:11.260
So, '71, '72, '73, '74, and you see now.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.580
Ten years have passed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:32.420
Seekers are amazing. And in Bombay, I am there hardly for ten days.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.460
When I'll go, ten days, fifteen days, at the most.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.740
In Delhi about ten, fifteen days.

00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:45.820
In Maharashtra I was a month, at the most.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.860
So, you can imagine.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.780
And how many things, I mean not only on this land

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.380
that we have Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.220
but that governement has given us land, people have given us land.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.420
So many things have happened in India. And I feel that

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.660
India is the place where Sahaja Yoga will be really established.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.740
Besides I would like to be established more in London.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.700
But what can we do? How far can we go with these horrible people?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.660
The media is hopeless.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.980
And dr. Naveen Singh is the, is the president

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.340
of the Great High Court, Royal High Court. He presided in Delhi.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.020
You must get his, you must get his tapes, you see.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.580
Why not write to somebody?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.740
We were at Bhopal and I wanted to talk to him.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.620
Tomorrow we'll try if we can get him on the phone.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.180
And the chief, I mean the Deputy Chief Minister,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.260
He spoke very highly about Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.180
Here, what to do?

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.660
Then maybe it needs some, a breakthrough, one or two proeminent people

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.500
getting Realization, recognizing You Mother.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.300
Maybe we need a breakthrough, some, one or two proeminent people,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.580
getting Realization and recognizing You.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.940
[Hindi]. They are horrible. I meet them every day.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.100
They think they are perfect.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.060
I mean it's not even one or two, Mother?

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.540
No, no, it's very impossible.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.460
Horrible.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.900
Horrible.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.940
This lord Hailsham was sitting next to Me in a dinner.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.299
And dr. Naveen Singh was next by him.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:04.420
Dr. Naveen told him, "This lady is a very famous,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.060
saint of area, with whom you are sitting."

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.700
Immediately he said, "I'm also a very famous saint, like that".

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.260
Imagine that,  he got his ahamkara, in hindi.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.580
Stupid.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:29.380
And next day his wife fell from the horse and died.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.580
At eighty, eighty years of age. Imagine this mad woman eighty years.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.460
Such a mad modernism.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.460
Oh, his nick name is "Bonkers Hogg".

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.820
Bonkers.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:44.580
Bonkers.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.100
Bonkers. Bonkers.

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:47.580
Bonkers. Really?

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:49.260
He's called Bonkers.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.780
That's all they say so.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.900
Really, I say that.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.180
Horrible.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.620
I mean he just said immediately,

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.260
without anything in mind, without any humillity.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.540
And dr. Naveen Singh, you know.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.540
He said, "This man is full of ego, Ahamkara".

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.260
Just can't do it.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.580
What can you do?

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.780
I've cured some very important people like this fellow,

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.420
this one I've brought.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.140
He talks very highly of Me, you said.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.940
That Indian...

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.500
Dr. [Athler].

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.380
He gave Me a book.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.500
But he said " I am an archetype also." Thank you.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.740
I don't know what all that is.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.140
Even Grant you see, he wrote letters after letters to Me,

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.340
"Mother accept me as your disciple".

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.180
And he gave of course an introduction to Don's book no doubt. But,

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.700
he would not circulate the book, nothing.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.500
He would not send it to his people, nothing of the kind.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.500
He's so money minded.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.380
"So if I publish it, then I  will."

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.540
That means you came for the publishing.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.540
There is no genuineness left in people anymore.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.820
In India you'll be surprised [as well].

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.380
Part of it the money we paid, no doubt, we paid part of it.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.820
But part of it was given. They gave Me the paper free.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.820
Here was never [unclear] even if they think to Mother.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.180
Printing free. So many things they did free for Me.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.780
All this is Mother's why should She pay.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.500
They have no sense of saintliness left.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.380
This horrible thing like,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:52.260
"[unclear], I'm going to do that". I don't know how will you manage.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.660
But still we must not be so much in despair.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.299
You see, according to Me it's a great progress in England.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.980
Because after all these are not artificial, these are real things.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.940
So real diamonds are rare, isn't it?

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.940
They have to.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.620
I never expected really, to be very frank, in the beginning

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.460
that we'll have so many Sahaja Yogis in London.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.100
So I'm overjoyed, whatever it is.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.580
But you people should not feel depressed, at all.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.180
And if you see the other side of it,

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.060
lots of things they are doing, like registration.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.540
You see, it is giving such a boost to us, because now Australians,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.100
are so slavish.

00:28:00.299 --> 00:28:02.740
They said, "If it is done in England we'll accept it here".

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.380
Authonom. No problem.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.700
They'll not question anything, they'll not say anything.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.860
They'll just accept. Can you believe it?

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.180
Thing like that.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.100
And I'm sure Americans may say the same.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.380
They'll not reason definetely.

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:26.860
"Was done in England, then it's all right.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.420
England are always, English are always correct."

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.940
And it is going to help also French. Do you know that?

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.900
France is the liver.

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.220
Some sort of a thing has happened in France.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.100
I think that's why I felt that this labourhood when it comes in,

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.620
people will be threaten, that maybe tomorrow communism may come.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.060
They will turn more towards God.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.780
That's what I felt we should go for.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.180
The fear, you see.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.580
Psychological fear.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.900
Like, like in Russia, I've seen.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.620
To them to be Christian is good, you see, if they are martyrs.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.580
All stupid people, no doubt, I must say.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.140
I think,

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.380
that I was wondering whom to vote of course. Let's see.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.420
Is Gavin going back tonight?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.700
Yes, Mother.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.660
What time?

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.940
I think they went straight from the program.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.380
Then [they went already].

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.780
Yes, is rather cold.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.140
They told Me that.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.380
She would be

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.980
back tomorrow itself, at the evening program.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.220
Who told You that? Christine?

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:26.180
Gavin was very dissapointed to them. They'll not pick the program.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.780
That's the way these people are, this way.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.299
So, what did they suggest then?

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:32.820
Sorry Mother.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.299
To you about that advertisment.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.620
So Mother, they told me that You discussed it again and

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.820
that it was best to leave it for the moment,

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.620
for the day if the man from IPO was going to come.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.020
He'll maybe come on Tuesday.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.220
Yes, I told him that.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.860
There's no use use pursueing these people.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.300
They are not suspicious of the tasks.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.820
Among suspicions is the furniture polish and the [unclear] lacquer.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.100
I know it poisons [that apetite] in some televisions. That's all.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.660
Doesn't matter.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.100
Good, for that they'll have a big drama, no?

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.299
Since you will crash.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.980
And then from a crashed thing,

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.820
a big ice you know, from Himalaya, it will come from the bottom.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.540
And if it is serious then you must know it, this is what it is.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.260
So an idea is [unclear].

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.140
Today the people we've got, they are good people.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.980
I think they will all come round and settle down.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.900
Would be good idea.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.820
We should not feel dissapointed and worried.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.620
It will be all right.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.140
Because I think mentally they understood Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.260
And it's better to have really serious Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.660
Or they give such a headache otherwise, isn't it?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.860
What has happened to Phil?

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.340
Phil, who used to come in London.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.420
Who was working with the.... Phil, what about him?

00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:07.820
There is no news about him, Mother.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.380
He went to Scotland?

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.820
Yes.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:15.860
And I think [he might be again in Brighton].

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.180
Nobody got some news so far.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.100
No, no, because you see he wanted to marry that girl,

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.740
he wanted to marry some girl, there. Phil.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.980
He asked Me about her. I told him, "All right, go ahead".

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.380
He stayed at Suzan's place first and all that.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.820
Somebody must find out about him.

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.180
Maybe this girl has ruined him, I don't know.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.860
But he told Me, "Mother, she is... quite happy with Sahaja Yoga."

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.660
I said, "All right, go and marry, don't worry. Nothing to worry.

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:03.780
For us you can come anytime. We get you married."

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:23.940
You must ask John what has happen?

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.100
He wanted to marry very badly, no doubt.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.540
We couldn't get a Sahaja Yogini to marry him, whatever it was.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.540
Cause this girl, he said, is good, she is, he asked for permission.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.900
I said,"All right.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.140
If you think that she comes to Sahaja Yoga, its all right".

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.100
Mother, help one yogi. There is a Sahaja Yogi in Edinburgh and...

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:13.980
Where?

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.500
There is someone in Edingburgh who comes across to Glasgow

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.660
[time to time] to see John and Cathy.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.100
They said they've seen Flint looking ill.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.980
He doesn't live in very good condition.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.700
He seemed to be getting back to his old ways, when they saw him.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.299
Old man?

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.980
They said he was, he didn't look very well.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:33.700
But what is his age?

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:39.220
He is, must be twenty-two, twenty-three, not much older.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.980
I don't know I received a letter from an old man who stays in Scotland.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.540
And he has been to Sahaja Yoga center. He's trying.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.260
Nothing works out.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.940
He is doing footsoak and everything,

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.540
I don't know from where he wrote to Me.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.100
But his health is not all right? This fellow's?

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.020
No. These persons have seen Kingsley Flint.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.300
Is that Flint?

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.940
Yes, they said that Flint looked ill, when they saw him.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.780
There is someone who comes from Edinburgh, to visit Glasgow,

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.100
and they told John that they've seen Kingsley

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.940
and apparentely he wasn't looking well, that he, he looked sick.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.180
Is it?

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.299
That fellow told?

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.620
Yes.

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.340
We should ask John to go and have a look.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.740
Could be.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.180
And maybe he started taken to drugs.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.500
Possibly.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.900
I remarked the one, very sensible boy.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.900
I don't know after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.740
and living with it for so many years, how can you go back to drugs?

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.940
After knowing what it is done to you.

00:37:08.299 --> 00:37:09.420
But possibly, possibly.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.540
I'm sure they'll find out.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.300
And talk to John.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.980
But Gavin was telling Me that still,

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.100
Scotland is to be worked out.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:53.860
It's not yet to be regarded as a Sahaja Yoga center.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.380
We'll have to work it out more, Gavin was saying.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.620
Gavin is from Scotland and he feels concerned, you know.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.660
Let's see.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.980
You see we wanted to start that organization to show how these

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.420
gurus have harmed us and all that.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.940
But now it's not necessary, they are all finished, [back to the hell].

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:26.980
All the people who are sort of regarded as something in this country,

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.900
are already believing in some things [and sort of].

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.660
Impossible to bring anyone near Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.340
I'll tell you about Peter Shore.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:46.260
One day he was sitting next to Me in a dinner.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.060
He said, "You look very happy person". I said, "I am".

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.780
He said, "I am not".

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.140
He said. So the wife of Michael Foot was next to Me.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.180
He said, "Are you happy person?"

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.460
She said, " Not at all, I'm a very unhappy person".

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.380
"Look at Mrs. Srivastava, is a happy person.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.100
But I can't understand, She must be ignorant about world affairs".

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.580
You see, the wife of Michael Foot,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:21.980
she said, "Must be. It's better to be ignorant, she says,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.180
so that at least you can be happy".

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.340
And then they started discussing their miseries, both of them,

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:29.700
and I didn't argue.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:44.380
And the Conservatives and all these, making fun of the Queen.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.620
And the party they had at the Queen,

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.940
what happened and, all these, imagine.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:42.660
I think some calamity will [happen].

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:51.140
If, if, Labor comes in, they will, they will take to God.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:59.620
I mean [inter-injury], before becoming comunist, let us take to God.

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.340
But they are also saying for instance that I've told them.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.220
He asked Me to whom to vote,

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.420
and then I said, "You vote the [Comission] now".

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.060
How can you decide with these three types of people.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.220
But at least that he has been really,

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.860
Shirley and William have been sincere to ask.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.780
I've met her also, quite often.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.140
But this has started looking like [unclear] or so. They cheat.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.220
All right with [unclear], Mother.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.460
But it's wonderful you are doing...

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.140
Is it a jasmin tea or?

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.260
What tea is this?

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.740
I think Mother, it is jasmin tea. It is jasmin tea.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.220
But today what was the situation with the younger boys

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.900
who were on the left hand side?

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.620
How do you find them?

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.500
You were all there?

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.940
The left hand side.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.700
Which ones, Mother?

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.860
Those which are sitting on the left hand side or the younger people.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.020
You were there.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.260
Anyhow it's crucial for them Mother.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.860
How was there?

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.740
One needs patience.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.340
Not the one needs patience? And the other one?

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.299
The other one was [unclear].

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.340
Then he was all right. No?

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.100
After some talk only this happened.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.340
He can if he wants.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.740
But how, what was his reaction?

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.300
Positive I think.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.020
Positive. Because of them.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:12.340
He's a friend of mine, Mother. He's a friend of mine.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.620
He's a friend of mine.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.020
Really?

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:20.380
Yeah. He didn't feel very much but he sees that there's something.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.180
But he could sort of see it.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.740
At the Agnya?

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.420
But it's not then [unclear].

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.580
Ekadesha.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.540
[unclear] and a lot of that talks and [cheap things / cheatting].

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.060
How do you think? It depends, I mean...

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.380
I think they are Catholics but I don't think he's some,

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.860
I mean he's taken drugs but not much, I mean sort of thing.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.780
Drugs? He's a Catholic.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.820
There's a double reaction.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.220
It's a double action.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.860
Right side.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:55.860
Oh, he will be all right.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.460
He looks positive.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.540
They have found out a new place they were telling.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.260
Kevin, did you tell him that?

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.820
Yes Mother.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.860
And tomorrow you...

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.660
I don't [hear something]: book it, book it.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.540
Better, better book it immediately.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.540
Or tomorrow you go and do it.

00:46:31.299 --> 00:46:32.820
Or you have to pay somemoney there?

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:37.700
Mother, I didn't book yet say in Laussane

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.299
but we'll talk it out tomorrow, Mother.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.740
You better take some money with you, in any case.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:49.140
I'll take, I'll take some in case they needed [at earnest], Mother,

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.660
so I could take it, in any case,

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.460
but usually these places is telling to [unclear].

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.780
Yes, they do, little bit.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.860
Little bit they do, I don't know about this one particular but they do.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.020
How goes with Phil? What about him?

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:08.780
It's very nice, you see. According to him there are hundred and eight,

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.020
and so many can come in the camp, you see.

00:47:13.299 --> 00:47:15.900
So there is a camping ground or they'l give us some,

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.020
what will they give for the camping?

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.060
Pardon?

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.700
There will be some tents?

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.780
Another statement is, Mother, is that thirty-five eighty-two

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.940
does include the camping ground, if we place our own tents.

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.820
Means?

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.340
Or, they will hire tents to us.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.100
Oh, I see.

00:47:35.299 --> 00:47:36.780
Those who want to sleep in the tents.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:37.580
That's good.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:43.380
and there will be accommodation for sixty to seventy people in rooms.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.500
[Only those people who could find place

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.140
because they are really happy to have You staying with them].

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.700
All right. And what about hundred eight you have said?

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.660
So, we have the people in rooms, then there are some outbuildings,

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.940
being quite [unfurnished]

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.220
but we can sleep on floor if we have sleeping beds,

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:10.140
then, in this [courtyard], is the camping ground, the camping area.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:16.540
And they will lend us the, we, we can pay for the hire of the tents.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.580
It's still o.k.

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:24.420
And food they will give for all of us, whatever is the number.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.700
Food... If we have a lot of children for instance,

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.460
they will do separate service for children,

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.580
then children will have food before the others.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.820
Ah, very good Mother that sounds.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.220
Sounds like it was made for us, Mother.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:47.100
I mean you are going to go in the children side or what?

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.700
All right. And then?

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.580
The best thing, Mother, is that when I phoned they said,

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.580
"We are having an open day tomorrow".

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.140
They haven't got an open day for years.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.540
That's the play.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:09.060
Also, you see, ask them if they will give food to all of us, together,

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.980
if we pay them the same amount.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.420
My impression Mother was that this would be possible,

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:21.140
though I suggested that we might cook one or two of our own meals,

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.820
perhaps after the Puja.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.860
No, no, better, better let them do it.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.220
Because you see, why to waste your energy in cooking?

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:30.540
O.k., we could do that.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:34.620
And moreover you see, tell them that we can pay fourteen to you

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.900
but you give us tents and everything

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.860
and we all can pay you fourteen, whatever you say.

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:41.940
I'll do it.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.300
It's remarcable.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.540
It's a miracle to have this place. It comes to us,

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.980
just like this, Mother.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.460
Yes, I told you that look out for something.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.700
And that is in Kent or Sussex?

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:05.020
It's in Sussex, Mother. It is in, it's in nature somewhere.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.220
Yes, I got it. Where is it Paul?

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:12.140
You see, you know your [unclear name] husband,

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:16.460
is a, is a nephew of the Duke of Sussex.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.260
You know that?

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:19.700
Mother, pardon?

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.340
Your brother in law.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.020
But that's true Mother, yes.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.700
We had him for a dinner in Geneva.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.940
Mother I think, he's very positive.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.860
I don't know, [he seems] quite positive.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:36.580
Is he?

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.380
Always.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:40.220
Always quiet.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.740
He's very much impressed that she has, you see,

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.460
that Mahila has married an English man.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:51.460
He's very happy. But I tought that's the only solution

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.740
by which he can be brought to Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.500
Because he was very adamant, very adamanat to begin with.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.900
Also, so Mother, he's visited India. He went to a visit in India

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:06.740
and he was visiting villages just around Pune,

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:11.060
and sitting on those grounds, isn't it, eating and [unclear],

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.460
that changed him a lot.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:14.500
That changed him?

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.700
Yes, a lot.

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.380
Good. That's a good thing.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.380
And where is the map?

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.660
Where is the place, Paul?

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.860
What's the name of the place?

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.380
Name of the place?

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.620
I thought it would be better, Mother, if it will be in Pulborough,

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.780
an outdoor, if it will be in the countryside.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.620
No, no, it will be near Pulborough.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.100
Near [Codmore]?

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.420
Oh, no, it's a...

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.060
You have been there, anyone?

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.700
Quite some, quite some old time, Mother.

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.060
Time [helps], it's a, it's a first day.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.660
It is quiet there.

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:10.780
Here's one of the most important talk of the day,

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.660
really going to this place. Let's try to.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:16.300
[It could be too windy] for Watersfield.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.340
Most Australians [are waiting].

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.860
And cold water because of...

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.180
Yeah,

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:27.060
Place is called Watersfield, residential center.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.100
Yeah, it's in the map.

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.860
Have a look it's in this...

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.540
It's in this area here, we are going there somewhere.

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.460
And where are we?

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.860
And we are here.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.700
And there, that's London.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:55.100
It's London, it's here. This is the motorway here.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.940
And the motorway to this place?

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.380
All the way to these places, that takes you along the coast.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.340
And along into the country.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.940
Yes. It is here, you say? Here?

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.500
It's in this area, here.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.020
Phil doesn't know exactly where it is,

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.299
so today [we are going to do] something.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:15.780
So this is the way to London also.

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.660
It's all very, very easy to get to. This is it.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:23.140
So it is nearer than Brighton, from London?

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:29.740
Oh, yes, yes. It's about nearly [fourty km distance].

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:31.340
Twenty minutes, Mother.

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.060
Ah, it is nearer, you see?

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.300
It's higher, here, and this road goes like that, you see?

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.140
And this goes to London there.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.780
And another road comes this way, so it's London all.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.380
Hmm, that's easier.

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:46.420
Cause London is there.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.660
This is the [Crookhill] road beacause this has got the [unclear].

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.220
I don't know these [minor] roads here.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.820
What do you mean? What road is this? Is this [Waterloo Road]?

00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.940
No, no, no, that's a, that's very [minor] roads.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.980
That's a country roads.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.940
That's the, mid road here, is Mid Sussex road.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.420
This road goes all the way to the Sussex. And goes up to Salisbury.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:13.940
And [further] down there.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.740
It would be very easy to get to the camp.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.380
It's a, and there's a train station near going to...

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:22.820
What train station is?

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.180
I don't know, but there is sign there.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.380
Little, little [line with] golden edges.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.140
And place is in there, is in there because here is Petworth

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.820
and it's a big park in Petworth with...

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.060
Beautiful there.

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:40.540
It's very good park, it's a big old house,

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.660
and they have an enormous landscape park

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.500
with a lot of animals running about there.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.740
And also with a lake, and as well as a lot to visit there.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.940
But this is another [unclear]?

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.780
That's Petworth, it's a beautiful place with a park.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.340
But people don't train people there?

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.220
So, they don't give it for conferences and things?

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:05.180
No, no, it's a Trust here. It's a national Trust.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.460
This one. Now, we'll be here, say about this part.

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.299
Yes, we'll be here.

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:18.260
That's Pulborough, that's a railway name, stop of the train.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:20.900
So we should easy get to.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.260
If we have to go to London, what is this place is here?

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.060
That's Guildford. That's...

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.260
That's on the other side.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.660
Yes. And then, this is a motorway here

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.660
that comes from the west country. And...

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:37.300
But it's very to get to.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.660
I regularly go from here through this area to park, on that way.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.820
That side we'll go.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.580
Would, would You like to...

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.700
This is straight forward.

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:53.660
Yes, it's straight. Would You like to see the place tomorrow, next day?

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.900
Let's see. It's better let them go and fix it up first of all, all right?

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.820
We can take this road, you mean to say, straight, to London?

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.580
Yes, I think that's London road. London is over here.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.860
This is a long way, but that is still longer, the motorway.

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:14.460
This is,  it's pretty large, it's the motorway,

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.580
to London and then this, very fast road, so here we come to Brighton.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.220
This is quite a nice road too.

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.660
Oh yes, it's way to London.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.100
We can go to London like that.

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.100
Isn't it?

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.220
Yes, this is a lovely part of the country.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:40.340
When Joan and I got married, we stayed in Petworth, in hotel,

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.540
for the honeymoon and holiday.

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.460
What about this place? What is this?

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.900
That's Crawley. There's been meetings as well.

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.780
Crawley, aha. I know Crawley.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:55.900
Crawley, you had some meetings? So how is it?

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:02.420
Crawley was. We had some meetings Mother, for a while.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:06.500
We had meetings for about six moths Mother and many people came

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:10.580
and at the end of six months there was one person established.

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.500
Really?

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.299
Yes.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:13.660
One.

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:18.940
Really, one person?

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.980
One, she is, if we can call her that way.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.740
Really terrible. What's the problem? You got [down]?

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.380
Spiritualism, Mother.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.060
What?

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.380
Spiritualism.

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.660
You know, spiritualism is about the worst [tally] in Crawley,

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.140
in England, before drugs.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.580
For Crawley?

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.980
It's very lethargic. It's very lethargic place because everybody,

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:45.980
thigs they do [take them] to the left, you know,

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.940
they [don't care a straw],

00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:51.540
watch emotional television, and they take a lot of drugs,

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.460
and they go into the pubs and that's about it.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.060
It's a very dull, uninteresting town.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.900
That's a spoilt place.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.300
And even though so many Indians are there who called Me twice?

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.620
Indians are doing very well there.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:06.860
They called You, Mother?

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.700
Ha, I was there twice for their Navaratri thing.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.940
They actually, that day it has worked

00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:16.299
but we couldn't stay in touch with them.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.580
The Indians are, it's very little response from them.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.740
And we are going to get in touch with them again.

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.220
I think Peter will try to [unclear] to Covington.

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.380
What did they say?

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:31.420
They have never tried, Mother.

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.820
They called Me twice.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.420
Since they are only interested in Me that's the trouble is.

00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:41.980
They want to call Me, they want Me to attend everytime,

00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:44.420
but they don't want to do themselves anything.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.100
As if for them I am like a king sitting there,

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:50.860
I should do nothing instead festivals,

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.580
things, bless all of them and finished.

00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:59.060
This is typical Indian idea.

00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.380
In England.

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.140
It's typical European idea, actually.

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.180
Many, many Christians have that aproach to God, Mother.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:11.900
It's something they switch on, on Sunday, like a television.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.180
They switch it off on Monday for a week and then forget about it.

00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:17.460
It's like that only, stupid people get in.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.100
Now, they have invited us to the Sindhu center, you see,

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.660
because they are having sort of a Havan and all that

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:26.660
and they think Shri Mataji must come and place the occasion and all that.

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:29.060
Finished.Then what?

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:34.340
Then if they have a problem then they must come and see Me, and now

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.740
on the second you see, three, four ladies from the High Commissioner,

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.980
are going to come and see Me. Deputy High Commissioner [strives] a lot.

00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.740
So if they have any problem, they must come and tell Me,

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.540
this is the problem, that solve our problem, or there is sickness,

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:50.380
or anything, the child is like this, everything.

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:52.700
But they are not going to get [to ascent],

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.060
they are not going to get to anything,

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.900
they are not going to become anything.

00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.860
It's only I am there so I will look after them,

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:01.540
"we'll leave it to Mother, things to do,

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.940
see I've got Your photograph, we do Puja,this, that".

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.540
I said, "What about you getting into it?"

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.700
That's the Indian style. And what to do?

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.340
I just can't talk to them, you know.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.340
Same with these Crawley people.

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.900
See, they wrote about Me  in the newspaper, do you know,

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.980
in the Times or something it had appeared?

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:24.020
They wrote that She came, She cured us, we had great, great time there,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.780
All these things they wrote.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.220
But then also they don't want to go a little further.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:34.100
Ask her. That day she was there for that Crawley meeting?

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.980
Yeah, [really] wonderful but...

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.660
Gavin was there.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.340
Thousands.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.820
They listened to Me about Sahaja Yoga, this, that.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.580
They are so fanatic Indians,

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:49.380
I've decided I'll never go to their Puja absolutely.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.860
Cut out.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.940
All fell, touched My feet, everything they did.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.300
But nobody is interested in Sahaja Yoga, in Realization.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.700
Can you imagine such a thing?

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.660
They are so materialistic, you have no idea.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.940
They are worse than you people.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.180
They have come here to earn money,

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.100
they think that if there is a saint here,

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.940
a saint's, you see, blessings can give them more money, that's all.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.500
That's their idea.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:28.700
So, it's like all the gutters, you see, have been brought here like

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.380
[rock of Gibraltar]. Ask [Jyoti], she will tell you.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.100
How can we change all their traditions, everything, I can't understand.

01:01:37.299 --> 01:01:39.460
They have become so horrid.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.340
And they have no esthetics nothing. Horrible.

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:44.460
So much money oriented.

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.380
Can't save them.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.900
For a while it's all right. But all the time, all the time, they want

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.500
some sort of a money and eating thing like.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.100
I call them export and import.

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.580
No higher things, nothing in their lives.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.180
That's why, you see, if you see Indians in India,

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:16.860
if you see them you'll be shocked.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.700
The difference is so much.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500
It's all there in India, all there.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:30.020
So when he told Me he's married an Indian I was rather worried, you see,

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.940
that now, a Gujrathi Indian.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:40.580
But [Jyoti] is remarcable, remarcable.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.060
She's not at all and she is still [Indian].

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:48.260
How can you to something so much, to such an extent?

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.700
I mean I just can't understand.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.620
Such a abusiveness.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.180
And look at that girl how she was rude.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.780
I mean Indians are normally never rude, you see.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.380
That's not done, it's not...

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.860
To an elder also, leave alone a person like Me,

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.340
but to an elder also they don't talk like that.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.780
You see... How old you are about?

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.940
All right.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.220
That's the fact.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.780
The other day they are going to have this Puja in the Hindu center.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:25.620
Let's see. They want Me to talk on Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.220
In London, Mother? In London?

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.620
In London.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:34.260
It's Shri Mataji coming. It's Shri Mataji. Very nice.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.220
So it's Shri Mataji has to look after their children,

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:42.460
look after everyone, look after our dogs, look after our things,

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.260
purses, look after our buffalos in India.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.820
All right.
