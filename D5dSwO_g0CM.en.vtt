00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.485
It’s hard to understand how people could not feel it.

00:00:15.723 --> 00:00:18.215
They all have suffered so much.

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:29.214
Whatever it is, for the Divine they do not suffer

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:36.265
and they come on this earth to show how stupid we are,

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:42.057
how we have not been able,

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:46.610
to see the Truth, to see the reality.

00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:52.989
But we repeat the mistakes again and again,

00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:00.230
because we do not know ourselves,

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:06.256
which is the only instrument by which you can know the Divine.

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:13.097
And when we do not know
ourselves we cannot understand the Divine.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.697
Still, it’s such a great thing to see so many of you are

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:31.577
there in that subtle area of the Spirit.

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:37.982
That you have the sensitivity, that you can feel,

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.519
the beauty of their lives, the greatness, the purity,

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.808
the innocence of these great incarnations who came on this earth.

00:01:58.188 --> 00:02:03.648
But with all that, we have a very great responsibility also.

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:10.488
Christ had only 12 disciples who didn’t even get their Realization till Christ lived.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.258
Afterwards they got Realization – 12 of them.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.701
And imagine, somebody like Thomas came to India.

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:25.985
So, how they took so much
responsibility. They were just ordinary fishermen.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.843
They didn’t care for anything else,
but they thought, “This is the Truth

00:02:31.043 --> 00:02:36.521
and that we have to spread
this, this is our responsibility.”

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.993
We are so many.

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:48.314
That is our responsibility. Is not only to enjoy yourself,

00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:51.639
but to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.719
and to practice it.

00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:03.447
Moreover, to have an ideal life,

00:03:03.932 --> 00:03:10.244
that people could see us: how we behave, how we talk,

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:16.420
how we treat each other, how we love each other,

00:03:17.104 --> 00:03:22.916
how we understand each other, how we run to help each other –

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:25.635
like one body.

00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:35.596
The message of Christ’s life is love.

00:03:37.108 --> 00:03:39.531
He openly talked about it.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:47.867
Before that, I don’t think any
incarnation talked like that, in that manner,

00:03:48.726 --> 00:03:50.818
so openly.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:57.555
He told His disciples that, “The greatest
joy for Me is to see that you love each other.”

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:06.188
All those things that have really made our society,

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.458
made our lives miserable of jealousies and pettiness,

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.932
small-mindedness has to go.
Otherwise you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:22.205
Where is the time for jealousy?

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.658
There is no mind, this…

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.287
that can see those things, anymore.

00:04:33.082 --> 00:04:35.335
So, all of us have to evolve,

00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:40.996
and the sign of evolution is not how
much we can talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:46.279
how much we can practice Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:49.277
how much we spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:49.573 --> 00:04:52.516
That’s not the sign, don’t be convinced by that.

00:04:53.297 --> 00:04:56.681
But the sign of Sahaja Yoga is that

00:04:56.882 --> 00:05:01.390
how much we can love each other,

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:07.429
how much we understand each other,

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:16.519
how much we can endure for others with great joy

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:21.919
and how much we do not bother about ourselves,

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:25.678
our families, our children.

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:32.944
This ‘mine, my, me’ has too.

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:39.719
It doesn’t go by saying “go”. It’s a state, again.

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.124
But then only you should be convinced,

00:05:42.324 --> 00:05:46.012
“Now I am a Sahaja Yogi!”

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:56.691
Christ has said, “Love thy neighbor as thyself!”

00:05:56.892 --> 00:06:00.151
I would say that

00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:04.956
you have to love every Sahaja Yogi as yourself,

00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:08.815
because they are part and parcel of this body.

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:12.781
You cannot afford to hate someone.

00:06:13.023 --> 00:06:19.077
Of course, those who are useless are thrown out of the body.

00:06:19.554 --> 00:06:24.491
But those who are there living, you must love them.

00:06:24.853 --> 00:06:27.624
I think this is the message of Christ

00:06:28.784 --> 00:06:33.879
and other message is absolute morality,

00:06:34.258 --> 00:06:36.338
absolute morality.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.469
As He has said that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.629
is such a subtle thing to say,

00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:53.778
that you should not have eyes which have adultery in them.

00:06:54.804 --> 00:06:59.554
It doesn’t mean only for women but it also mean for saints.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:08.047
It also means for properties,
it also means for the success of others.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.959
Adultery means the one where you try to aggress

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.487
and to be greedy about it.

00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:26.452
If there is greed or if there is lust in your eyes,

00:07:26.653 --> 00:07:29.809
then it’s an adulterous eyes.

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:35.719
It is very subtle, I know.

00:07:36.192 --> 00:07:38.519
It is very subtle

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:43.694
and the attention is the best way

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:47.159
which communicates to you

00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:53.780
whether you are above lust and greed or not.

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:59.759
But the more you try to rise above these things,

00:08:00.329 --> 00:08:02.735
your heart opens

00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:06.783
and you start enjoying your virtues, your morality.

00:08:06.983 --> 00:08:11.549
You enjoy, you don’t think you are moral, you don’t think that way,

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.273
but you enjoy that state where you
are really moral because you are moral.

00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:21.582
You just enjoy yourself.

00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:28.679
It’s a headache to be interested in some
woman, interested in some man. It’s a headache.

00:08:29.043 --> 00:08:31.459
It’s a joyless pursuit.

00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:36.768
And once you are detached,

00:08:37.187 --> 00:08:40.226
the joy is complete…

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:50.751
…because you are one with reality, pure reality.

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:53.667
There is no …

00:08:57.214 --> 00:09:03.599
inhibitions, no restrictions, no taboos, – nothing,

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.332
but just you are that!

00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:09.175
Nobody has to tell you.

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:12.805
If you are gold, you are gold.

00:09:13.006 --> 00:09:17.799
Nobody has to tell you, “Now,
you don’t behave like non-gold”,

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.474
you are gold, so you are gold.

00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:23.699
That’s the power!

00:09:24.925 --> 00:09:31.370
And the power of a Sahaja Yogi is
that he is the purest form of human being.

00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:35.649
Without the power what are we? Nothing.

00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:40.279
The purest form

00:09:41.057 --> 00:09:46.759
and in the purest form of love

00:09:47.724 --> 00:09:53.359
you get the purest form of knowledge.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.639
This is [kaivaldya?] is the,

00:09:57.613 --> 00:10:01.999
absolute knowledge

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.652
and absolute love,

00:10:09.618 --> 00:10:12.782
detached, pure.

00:10:19.128 --> 00:10:26.128
That time when you are in that state,

00:10:29.852 --> 00:10:34.298
you just watch anything, see anything,

00:10:37.573 --> 00:10:43.307
all the power of giving joy from everything

00:10:43.597 --> 00:10:50.058
just starts bubbling into you and you don’t see
the bad things at all, you never see the bad things.

00:10:55.729 --> 00:10:59.879
The power of enjoying everything

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:03.877
is the power of Sahaja Yogis, to enjoy everything.

00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:10.299
Anything can be enjoyed,

00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:14.133
any small thing can be enjoyed,

00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:17.399
any big thing can be enjoyed.

00:11:17.739 --> 00:11:20.943
But impurities one cannot enjoy,

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:24.068
immorality you cannot enjoy.

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:29.281
It’s not enjoyment, it’s just a fascination
maybe, I don’t know what it is called as,

00:11:29.482 --> 00:11:32.679
as I cannot enjoy then I don’t know what it
is.

00:11:32.927 --> 00:11:38.866
But what you enjoy really is the purity of another personality,

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:41.870
the purity of this,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:47.352
all that is done by someone with such pure heart.

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:52.070
And the deeper you seek,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.701
it becomes simpler and simpler.

00:11:56.901 --> 00:11:59.880
Then you don’t say smart things, no, you don’t,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.222
don’t have to show off, nothing.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.039
You just say simple, sweet nice things.

00:12:09.463 --> 00:12:13.479
It’s so touching, so beautiful,

00:12:16.689 --> 00:12:22.679
but must allow the deeper love within us to come out.

00:12:23.246 --> 00:12:28.972
Many people love also but they don’t know how to express it.

00:12:29.189 --> 00:12:34.946
There are many people who are misunderstood,
because they don’t know how to express their love.

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:40.039
In Sahaja Yoga you have to learn the yukti,

00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:42.929
the technique.

00:12:43.212 --> 00:12:47.305
“Yukti” is a very sweet word, not technique is not,

00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:51.212
technique deals with something very materialistic.

00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:55.578
But yukti means the trick, trick of the trade,

00:12:55.906 --> 00:13:02.479
what to say when that would really just pierce,

00:13:04.655 --> 00:13:10.593
like a dart in the heart of someone, the beautiful feeling.

00:13:14.508 --> 00:13:18.477
That one has to understand and practice.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.430
All little-little things here and there,

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:31.121
little turning here and there is
an art of living a Sahaja Yoga life.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:36.687
And I’ve seen children say such sweet-sweet things.

00:13:37.481 --> 00:13:41.288
That’s why Christ has said that, “You have to be like children

00:13:41.648 --> 00:13:47.048
to enter into the Kingdom of God”, but I
would say, “to stay in the Kingdom of God.”

00:13:47.397 --> 00:13:52.787
You have to be simple like children, deep and simple.

00:13:58.948 --> 00:14:04.602
This seminar, or whatever you may call
it, Ganapatipule, I don’t know what you call,

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:10.811
is a Divine congregation of all the Gods and Goddesses,

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.932
is very symbolic to Me,

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:22.771
because this represents the whole world,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.394
it represents the problems of the whole world

00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:29.399
and also the solutions.

00:14:30.157 --> 00:14:34.016
It’s such a beautiful idea.

00:14:34.227 --> 00:14:38.736
I don’t know how it worked into
My head that I started this kind of a,

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:45.158
beautiful congregation to meet you all.

00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:52.319
It was very nice yesterday, you kept
awake all the while and came to see Me.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:57.255
I could meet all of you and I could have some rapport.

00:14:57.455 --> 00:15:00.158
I couldn’t say much, I was just smiling at you,

00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:04.171
but just I could express My
love and you gave Me that chance.

00:15:04.372 --> 00:15:06.882
I must thank you very much for that.
