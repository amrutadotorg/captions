WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:06.560
Before going to America,

00:06.560 --> 00:11.599
I wanted to speak more about the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:11.600 --> 00:16.889
and about Shri Krishna’s aspect within us.

00:16.899 --> 00:22.359
In the first Puja in Geneva

00:22.369 --> 00:27.903
I spoke quite a lot about it.

00:27.909 --> 00:32.079
But...

01:00.408 --> 01:07.795
There is no end to it, of course because it is the centre of Virat.

01:16.852 --> 01:24.390
But one has to realise that the message of Shri Krishna was ‘to surrender’.

01:36.442 --> 01:44.079
Now, the surrendering that we think in the gross way

01:44.072 --> 01:50.500
is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy.

02:09.241 --> 02:12.067
So when the word ‘surrender’ is spoken,

02:12.051 --> 02:19.991
we build up our barriers by thinking that now we have to surrender – leave something to the other party.

02:39.732 --> 02:44.737
But when Shri Krishna talked about surrender,

02:44.727 --> 02:52.026
He was saying that, "Surrender your enemies to Me, so that I will get rid of them."

03:05.866 --> 03:12.006
Now, the worst enemy that we have is our ego.

03:21.643 --> 03:25.556
And with ego starts all kinds of other problems,

03:25.553 --> 03:31.846
because it is the biggest barrier for our growth.

03:43.298 --> 03:49.219
And the ego starts, as you know, from the Vishuddhi Chakra

03:57.079 --> 04:00.681
and can be sucked into Vishuddhi Chakra.

04:07.221 --> 04:12.520
Now let us see how is Vishuddhi Chakra made is.

04:17.616 --> 04:23.417
All the vowels that we use come from Vishuddhi Chakra.

04:37.459 --> 04:56.952
And like in Devanagari language it is "a aa i ii u uu e ei o au ru ruu lu luu om aha," – sixteen.

05:07.012 --> 05:13.312
So as you know that you cannot compile a word without a vowel, is so important.

05:20.892 --> 05:26.903
The consonant is weak,

05:26.892 --> 05:33.227
without "nirbal," without any strength, without the vowel.

05:41.571 --> 05:50.471
So the strength of a person comes through the Vishuddhi Chakra in his speech.

06:06.355 --> 06:12.472
But it can be absolutely stiff also, the strength could be absolutely stiff.

06:23.764 --> 06:31.022
Supposing you have a very strong weapon but you can’t lift it, so what’s the use of having a weapon like that?

06:38.690 --> 06:48.898
So, this Mr. Ego tries to make the weapon heavy and stiff like jammed machine guns.

07:03.372 --> 07:08.989
Now that is what He has said that, “Surrender your ego to Me.”

07:18.274 --> 07:32.208
So that when you say a mantra, or utter words, they are effective as weapons, good weapons, effective, good weapons, efficient.

07:56.524 --> 08:11.017
Now when we talk, let us see how I see your ego expressed in your talk, so that you will understand how to address Me and to judge yourself.

08:16.947 --> 08:28.403
For example shaking your necks too much is a sign of a Mr. Ego shaking your head for nothing at all. Like many people have a habit.

08:28.416 --> 08:32.756
“Yes,” they’ll say and they’ll go on like this for ten times, there is no need.

08:46.813 --> 08:54.490
Actually, you should move only once, with humility, the head, “Yes, Mother,” is all right.

09:03.988 --> 09:11.836
You must move your neck with respect and with understanding that Shri Krishna is sitting there.

09:26.183 --> 09:28.773
With dignity.

09:31.613 --> 09:40.769
But we forget it all the time and we start using it to assert ourselves when we talk to someone.

09:40.829 --> 09:48.253
And we shake it too much or we push it in such a way that another person is sort of dominated by it.

10:04.297 --> 10:11.945
Now, there is another method of when you talk to Me, like saying “No, Mother.”

10:11.945 --> 10:20.485
It’s very common. If I say anything, the first reaction of people could be “No, Mother.”

10:33.151 --> 10:42.250
After all, you see there is a force going on, even when I’m speaking it is a mantra, when I’m not speaking, is a mantra flowing.

10:42.241 --> 10:48.387
And suddenly you come out with your “No, Mother." So you create a ripple back in the whole thing.

11:04.116 --> 11:14.021
Now, at that time, if you just listen to Me what I’m saying, the saying itself will work it out. You don't have to do anything.

11:38.446 --> 11:45.559
Now, the... another way of is the style in which you talk to Me,

11:45.536 --> 11:50.122
also I can see the right Vishuddhi acting.

12:00.842 --> 12:13.398
It is when we talk normally to each other, we’ll say, if we have to say “yes,” we’ll say “m-m,” like that, is very common here “ha-a,” is a style, they say,

12:21.813 --> 12:27.728
“hum-um” like that, and “a-a!” A special style!

12:27.728 --> 12:32.905
And then on top of that to say “hmm-mh”

12:32.925 --> 12:41.496
is, if you see it clearly, it is... you are not receiving anything in it,

12:41.487 --> 12:48.808
but you are trying to sort of... put equal pressure on the flow.

13:08.781 --> 13:19.736
The humility is the best way of conquering this ego of Vishuddhi.

13:26.683 --> 13:35.828
And when talking to others, try to develop sweet methods, sweet ways, unhurting other people.

13:53.526 --> 13:59.251
And you will be surprised that Vishuddhi will immediately start behaving in such a sweet manner,

13:59.311 --> 14:09.330
because the bhoots don’t like sweetness, they are quarrelsome, they are harsh, they are always trying to say something curt.

14:14.452 --> 14:16.622
(Sahaja Yogini:) Here is Mr. Shrivastava.

14:18.372 --> 14:23.429
See now – at the wrong time. All right, I’d better talk.

14:23.429 --> 14:25.219
One minute.

14:25.229 --> 14:30.219
Bolo Shri Jaganmata Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki – JAI!

14:42.044 --> 14:49.955
So this Vishuddhi on the right hand side is to be controlled by surrendering

14:49.965 --> 14:55.465
as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with.

14:55.474 --> 15:02.770
And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from your heart,

15:02.781 --> 15:06.291
it should not be a lip service.

15:16.962 --> 15:22.652
From your heart: “I don’t want this ego any more,

15:22.652 --> 15:24.961
I want reality.

15:32.441 --> 15:42.458
Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me.”

16:05.049 --> 16:19.535
And once you start doing it from your heart, you’ll be amazed that your voice will become sweet.

16:27.981 --> 16:34.041
Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it.

16:41.901 --> 16:50.570
That is what we say that you have now got "Vak Shakti," means "the power of speech."

17:05.470 --> 17:16.995
So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, “I’m not doing anything, it is You who do everything."

17:29.713 --> 17:33.513
So that a little drop has now become an ocean.

17:40.083 --> 17:48.520
And so, your sound has got the power of the ocean.

18:00.961 --> 18:09.012
Now, the second thing you have to surrender

18:09.022 --> 18:17.627
is the pride or vanity.

18:32.190 --> 18:39.516
Now, the vanity can be of many types which are artificial things, absolutely.

18:46.491 --> 18:54.951
Before God, what is your property? What is your money? What is your position?

19:04.586 --> 19:07.056
What is your family?

19:09.420 --> 19:11.785
What is your education?

19:14.625 --> 19:20.658
You see, everything has no value in the presence of God.

19:30.188 --> 19:36.330
The possessions that we value so much have no value.

19:42.860 --> 20:03.212
So, one has to realize that if we are the possessions of God, we should be proud on one thing only that His vibrations flow through us.

20:21.186 --> 20:24.376
That is, He is proud of us.

20:30.346 --> 20:48.371
Like supposing you give Me a fruit or say a Ganesh or anything, it gets very much valued because I have touched it and the vibrations are there.

21:05.457 --> 21:16.701
Like this Ganesh now, for example, if you see the value of this is zero as far as the metal is concerned,

21:16.711 --> 21:23.776
but when made into art, it has some much more value.

21:38.772 --> 21:43.281
In this world the value increases with art,

21:48.310 --> 21:53.490
but in the realm of God or in the spiritual world or Divine world,

21:53.490 --> 22:07.489
the value of a Ganesha, the same Ganesha, could be thousand time more than what it is now, as just an art piece.

22:16.964 --> 22:23.613
So that is what is now given to you, a very high value.

22:37.887 --> 22:49.770
So the pride and the vanity of artificiality, artificial things is all man-made, mythical, and should be surrendered because it's a myth.

23:02.367 --> 23:11.445
Then human mind has another capacity to be jealous,

23:11.430 --> 23:14.060
to be jealous of others.

23:30.140 --> 23:34.752
This also comes from unwise understanding.

23:43.883 --> 23:52.153
If you surrender your jealousies at the Lotus Feet of God, I mean, you are doing all rubbish to God, actually.

24:09.618 --> 24:14.644
These stupid jealousies that you have

24:18.883 --> 24:26.163
are, as you know, of no value, neither in this world nor in that world.

24:36.115 --> 24:41.278
The most surprising thing is that the Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other.

24:51.112 --> 24:55.492
And I still can’t understand, how can it be?

24:59.022 --> 25:07.626
If you are standing in the sunshine then you all are jealous of your shadows?

25:17.394 --> 25:23.014
Somebody’s shadows are big, somebody’s shadows are small, so you are jealous of each other?

25:31.189 --> 25:38.772
Sometimes I give a present to one person, can’t give to others, then they get jealous.

25:49.141 --> 25:54.703
If I give more time to somebody then others are jealous!

25:59.525 --> 26:07.965
I only give more time, sometimes, to people who really are getting lost.

26:16.456 --> 26:25.548
So, one has to understand that all our ideas about jealousies are stupid.

26:33.488 --> 26:39.190
And I can’t understand those who are not realized that they are jealous of Sahaja Yogis,

26:39.190 --> 26:45.030
and they try to make them fall. Instead of being jealous you should become like Sahaja Yogis!

27:00.283 --> 27:07.543
In Sahaja Yoga also I’ve seen some very funny things happening – an incidence.

27:16.482 --> 27:28.859
Like a person came to Me and was very angry that, “Mother, see, You spent so much time with a particular person, and I’m very jealous.

27:28.899 --> 27:33.857
And You said that I have to be like the people about whom I’m jealous.

27:33.907 --> 27:39.617
So I would like to know how to be like the person who was with you for such a time?”

27:53.977 --> 28:02.207
So I said, “That fellow is really a lunatic! You want to become a lunatic? Have you no discretion?”

28:02.302 --> 28:15.281
Sahaja Yoga must have – a Sahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is all right to understand that what I’m saying has to be used discretly, not blindly.

28:38.547 --> 28:49.623
So you can understand, without discretion, whatever I say, how funnily you can use it, so detrimental to your growth.

29:06.726 --> 29:14.076
So, another offshoot of ego is called as ‘hot temper’.

29:19.568 --> 29:27.038
Of course, it is there to be used against people who try to insult your Mother, you have to do that.

29:41.605 --> 29:48.545
That must be used for people who go against the Holy Ghost, as Christ has said.

30:05.672 --> 30:15.760
In the same way, you should not tolerate any nonsense against Me from anyone whatsoever, not even this much.

30:33.953 --> 30:40.273
But you can tolerate other Sahaja Yogis in other matters.

30:50.054 --> 31:01.279
Another enemy we have is the greed.

31:08.386 --> 31:13.785
I mean material greed...

31:13.805 --> 31:17.468
or... material greed.

31:19.881 --> 31:30.145
and also human greed, like possessing your wife, possessing your children, possessing this, possessing Mataji also.

31:46.484 --> 31:49.474
This also must be surrendered.

31:54.114 --> 32:04.427
And this could be very dangerous that, “This is my child, this is my son, I must possess it,” can be very dangerous in Sahaja Yoga also.

32:13.847 --> 32:21.141
“This is my carpet, this is my camera, this is my tape-recorder.”

32:31.046 --> 32:41.314
Once you start understanding what is mine is not a truth.

32:41.324 --> 32:48.908
Nothing is mine, that’s the truth.

33:02.738 --> 33:12.919
Also some people, like I know of, they say that “my job,” or “my business,” or “my enterprise.”

33:12.921 --> 33:24.909
We had the other day, one gentleman in Geneva who was very troublesome, because he is so conscious of all these things.

33:35.853 --> 33:49.012
So the greed, also the lust of other women and indulging into lust too much,

33:50.202 --> 33:53.482
giving too much importance to the agencies of lust.

34:11.643 --> 34:18.693
That creates great problems, for not only Sahaja Yogis, but on the whole for Sahaja Yoga also.

34:33.026 --> 34:41.855
It is expressed in both types of people; those who are living in a very free world as well as people who are over-suppressed.

35:04.387 --> 35:12.923
I know of people, those who are supposed to be brought up in very religious, so called, atmosphere,

35:12.933 --> 35:17.443
when exposed to women, suddenly get too much attracted towards them.

35:39.143 --> 35:56.489
So, it’s that maturity of your innocence must be developed that keeps you a very religious person, dharmic person.

36:06.605 --> 36:17.870
And the innocence to know how far to go with men and women – that’s the wisdom of innocence.

36:27.342 --> 36:34.902
Children, if you see, they know exactly, if there’s a lady, if there’s a man, how to behave.

36:43.932 --> 36:48.135
So, the innocence is not stupidity.

36:49.925 --> 37:10.726
Is a complete wisdom, and when it matures in its full form, it just knows how to be with people without indulging into anyone of these enemies.

37:28.200 --> 37:38.322
Each enemy is sufficient to finish not only one person, but billions and billions.

37:54.904 --> 38:08.555
So best way to develop that absolute nature of your Vishuddhi Chakra is to witness the whole thing with a detached mind

38:22.684 --> 38:41.290
and to develop love for your Mother in your heart, so that She cleanses all these enemies in such a way that when you are faced with them you are a powerful person.

39:04.812 --> 39:16.886
Mentally, I think, most of the Sahaja Yogis understand that obedience to Divinity is the only way – mentally, rationally.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.410
Mentally.

39:41.021 --> 39:50.027
Now, even if you understand something mentally, it’s not your innate nature.

40:03.325 --> 40:10.138
So what I told you yesterday, is when you accept something mentally and you cannot do it, you feel guilty about it.

40:22.326 --> 40:27.436
Then you become your own Guru and punish yourself,

40:31.538 --> 40:38.238
and try to make this as your innate nature.

40:48.814 --> 40:57.229
It’s a state, it clicks, once it clicks you can see immediately. I know who is surrendered.

41:20.671 --> 41:29.077
So, as Shri Krishna has said that: "Sarva - dharmanam parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja."

41:29.097 --> 41:38.404
He has said: “Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to Me, surrender to My dharma only.”

41:50.106 --> 41:57.935
So the dharmas we have in our country, as we say, is a pitru dharma – what you owe to your father,

41:57.955 --> 42:04.130
matru dharma – what you owe to your mother, then your desha dharma – what you owe to your country,

42:04.370 --> 42:15.337
then vishwa dharma – what you owe to the whole universe, pati dharma – what you owe to your husband, patni dharma – what you owe to your patni,

42:15.327 --> 42:21.440
like all that, you see, that relationship in which you owe to them, what you have to do.

42:41.955 --> 42:50.549
But when He says, “Surrender all these dharmas," He is meaning to say, “You should only know what you owe to Me,"

43:01.964 --> 43:03.904
meaning the Divinity.

43:06.604 --> 43:09.851
So now, Shri Krishna is not there.

43:12.521 --> 43:17.711
It’s Me who is Shri Krishna, so you must know what you owe to Me.

43:24.939 --> 43:27.539
I’ve only changed My language.

43:31.909 --> 43:41.817
He used to take out His finger and say that, “Give up everything and surrender everything to Me.” I don’t do that way, I give a big lecture and bring you to a point.

43:58.716 --> 44:12.183
So, that should not divert your attention from the right goal that you have to achieve by surrendering.

44:21.381 --> 44:29.869
And it is going to work out very well with you people here, I’m sure.

44:29.879 --> 44:40.234
And one day I’ll find the whole Germans
surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
