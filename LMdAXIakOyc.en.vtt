00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.560
Before going to America,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.599
I wanted to speak more about the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.889
and about Shri Krishna’s aspect within us.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:22.359
In the first Puja in Geneva

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.903
I spoke quite a lot about it.

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.079
But...

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:07.795
There is no end to it, of course because it is the centre of Virat.

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:24.390
But one has to realise that the message of Shri Krishna was ‘to surrender’.

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:44.079
Now, the surrendering that we think in the gross way

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:50.500
is like an enemy surrenders to another enemy.

00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.067
So when the word ‘surrender’ is spoken,

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:19.991
we build up our barriers by thinking that now we have to surrender – leave something to the other party.

00:02:39.732 --> 00:02:44.737
But when Shri Krishna talked about surrender,

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:52.026
He was saying that, "Surrender your enemies to Me, so that I will get rid of them."

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:12.006
Now, the worst enemy that we have is our ego.

00:03:21.643 --> 00:03:25.556
And with ego starts all kinds of other problems,

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:31.846
because it is the biggest barrier for our growth.

00:03:43.298 --> 00:03:49.219
And the ego starts, as you know, from the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.681
and can be sucked into Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:04:07.221 --> 00:04:12.520
Now let us see how is Vishuddhi Chakra made is.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:23.417
All the vowels that we use come from Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:56.952
And like in Devanagari language it is "a aa i ii u uu e ei o au ru ruu lu luu om aha," – sixteen.

00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:13.312
So as you know that you cannot compile a word without a vowel, is so important.

00:05:20.892 --> 00:05:26.903
The consonant is weak,

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:33.227
without "nirbal," without any strength, without the vowel.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:50.471
So the strength of a person comes through the Vishuddhi Chakra in his speech.

00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:12.472
But it can be absolutely stiff also, the strength could be absolutely stiff.

00:06:23.764 --> 00:06:31.022
Supposing you have a very strong weapon but you can’t lift it, so what’s the use of having a weapon like that?

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:48.898
So, this Mr. Ego tries to make the weapon heavy and stiff like jammed machine guns.

00:07:03.372 --> 00:07:08.989
Now that is what He has said that, “Surrender your ego to Me.”

00:07:18.274 --> 00:07:32.208
So that when you say a mantra, or utter words, they are effective as weapons, good weapons, effective, good weapons, efficient.

00:07:56.524 --> 00:08:11.017
Now when we talk, let us see how I see your ego expressed in your talk, so that you will understand how to address Me and to judge yourself.

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:28.403
For example shaking your necks too much is a sign of a Mr. Ego shaking your head for nothing at all. Like many people have a habit.

00:08:28.416 --> 00:08:32.756
“Yes,” they’ll say and they’ll go on like this for ten times, there is no need.

00:08:46.813 --> 00:08:54.490
Actually, you should move only once, with humility, the head, “Yes, Mother,” is all right.

00:09:03.988 --> 00:09:11.836
You must move your neck with respect and with understanding that Shri Krishna is sitting there.

00:09:26.183 --> 00:09:28.773
With dignity.

00:09:31.613 --> 00:09:40.769
But we forget it all the time and we start using it to assert ourselves when we talk to someone.

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:48.253
And we shake it too much or we push it in such a way that another person is sort of dominated by it.

00:10:04.297 --> 00:10:11.945
Now, there is another method of when you talk to Me, like saying “No, Mother.”

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:20.485
It’s very common. If I say anything, the first reaction of people could be “No, Mother.”

00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:42.250
After all, you see there is a force going on, even when I’m speaking it is a mantra, when I’m not speaking, is a mantra flowing.

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:48.387
And suddenly you come out with your “No, Mother." So you create a ripple back in the whole thing.

00:11:04.116 --> 00:11:14.021
Now, at that time, if you just listen to Me what I’m saying, the saying itself will work it out. You don't have to do anything.

00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:45.559
Now, the... another way of is the style in which you talk to Me,

00:11:45.536 --> 00:11:50.122
also I can see the right Vishuddhi acting.

00:12:00.842 --> 00:12:13.398
It is when we talk normally to each other, we’ll say, if we have to say “yes,” we’ll say “m-m,” like that, is very common here “ha-a,” is a style, they say,

00:12:21.813 --> 00:12:27.728
“hum-um” like that, and “a-a!” A special style!

00:12:27.728 --> 00:12:32.905
And then on top of that to say “hmm-mh”

00:12:32.925 --> 00:12:41.496
is, if you see it clearly, it is... you are not receiving anything in it,

00:12:41.487 --> 00:12:48.808
but you are trying to sort of... put equal pressure on the flow.

00:13:08.781 --> 00:13:19.736
The humility is the best way of conquering this ego of Vishuddhi.

00:13:26.683 --> 00:13:35.828
And when talking to others, try to develop sweet methods, sweet ways, unhurting other people.

00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:59.251
And you will be surprised that Vishuddhi will immediately start behaving in such a sweet manner,

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:09.330
because the bhoots don’t like sweetness, they are quarrelsome, they are harsh, they are always trying to say something curt.

00:14:14.452 --> 00:14:16.622
(Sahaja Yogini:) Here is Mr. Shrivastava.

00:14:18.372 --> 00:14:23.429
See now – at the wrong time. All right, I’d better talk.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.219
One minute.

00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:30.219
Bolo Shri Jaganmata Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki – JAI!

00:14:42.044 --> 00:14:49.955
So this Vishuddhi on the right hand side is to be controlled by surrendering

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:55.465
as it is said, actually you surrender your ego to begin with.

00:14:55.474 --> 00:15:02.770
And this ego when you surrender, it has to be done from your heart,

00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:06.291
it should not be a lip service.

00:15:16.962 --> 00:15:22.652
From your heart: “I don’t want this ego any more,

00:15:22.652 --> 00:15:24.961
I want reality.

00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:42.458
Let the reality be seen by me, felt by me, enjoyed by me.”

00:16:05.049 --> 00:16:19.535
And once you start doing it from your heart, you’ll be amazed that your voice will become sweet.

00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:34.041
Apart from that it will have the Divine Power flowing through it.

00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:50.570
That is what we say that you have now got "Vak Shakti," means "the power of speech."

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:16.995
So when you surrender ego, what do you do actually is to say that, “I’m not doing anything, it is You who do everything."

00:17:29.713 --> 00:17:33.513
So that a little drop has now become an ocean.

00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:48.520
And so, your sound has got the power of the ocean.

00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:09.012
Now, the second thing you have to surrender

00:18:09.022 --> 00:18:17.627
is the pride or vanity.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:39.516
Now, the vanity can be of many types which are artificial things, absolutely.

00:18:46.491 --> 00:18:54.951
Before God, what is your property? What is your money? What is your position?

00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:07.056
What is your family?

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.785
What is your education?

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:20.658
You see, everything has no value in the presence of God.

00:19:30.188 --> 00:19:36.330
The possessions that we value so much have no value.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:20:03.212
So, one has to realize that if we are the possessions of God, we should be proud on one thing only that His vibrations flow through us.

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:24.376
That is, He is proud of us.

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:48.371
Like supposing you give Me a fruit or say a Ganesh or anything, it gets very much valued because I have touched it and the vibrations are there.

00:21:05.457 --> 00:21:16.701
Like this Ganesh now, for example, if you see the value of this is zero as far as the metal is concerned,

00:21:16.711 --> 00:21:23.776
but when made into art, it has some much more value.

00:21:38.772 --> 00:21:43.281
In this world the value increases with art,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:53.490
but in the realm of God or in the spiritual world or Divine world,

00:21:53.490 --> 00:22:07.489
the value of a Ganesha, the same Ganesha, could be thousand time more than what it is now, as just an art piece.

00:22:16.964 --> 00:22:23.613
So that is what is now given to you, a very high value.

00:22:37.887 --> 00:22:49.770
So the pride and the vanity of artificiality, artificial things is all man-made, mythical, and should be surrendered because it's a myth.

00:23:02.367 --> 00:23:11.445
Then human mind has another capacity to be jealous,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.060
to be jealous of others.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:34.752
This also comes from unwise understanding.

00:23:43.883 --> 00:23:52.153
If you surrender your jealousies at the Lotus Feet of God, I mean, you are doing all rubbish to God, actually.

00:24:09.618 --> 00:24:14.644
These stupid jealousies that you have

00:24:18.883 --> 00:24:26.163
are, as you know, of no value, neither in this world nor in that world.

00:24:36.115 --> 00:24:41.278
The most surprising thing is that the Sahaja Yogis feel jealous of each other.

00:24:51.112 --> 00:24:55.492
And I still can’t understand, how can it be?

00:24:59.022 --> 00:25:07.626
If you are standing in the sunshine then you all are jealous of your shadows?

00:25:17.394 --> 00:25:23.014
Somebody’s shadows are big, somebody’s shadows are small, so you are jealous of each other?

00:25:31.189 --> 00:25:38.772
Sometimes I give a present to one person, can’t give to others, then they get jealous.

00:25:49.141 --> 00:25:54.703
If I give more time to somebody then others are jealous!

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:07.965
I only give more time, sometimes, to people who really are getting lost.

00:26:16.456 --> 00:26:25.548
So, one has to understand that all our ideas about jealousies are stupid.

00:26:33.488 --> 00:26:39.190
And I can’t understand those who are not realized that they are jealous of Sahaja Yogis,

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:45.030
and they try to make them fall. Instead of being jealous you should become like Sahaja Yogis!

00:27:00.283 --> 00:27:07.543
In Sahaja Yoga also I’ve seen some very funny things happening – an incidence.

00:27:16.482 --> 00:27:28.859
Like a person came to Me and was very angry that, “Mother, see, You spent so much time with a particular person, and I’m very jealous.

00:27:28.899 --> 00:27:33.857
And You said that I have to be like the people about whom I’m jealous.

00:27:33.907 --> 00:27:39.617
So I would like to know how to be like the person who was with you for such a time?”

00:27:53.977 --> 00:28:02.207
So I said, “That fellow is really a lunatic! You want to become a lunatic? Have you no discretion?”

00:28:02.302 --> 00:28:15.281
Sahaja Yoga must have – a Sahaja Yogi must have discretion if his Vishuddhi is all right to understand that what I’m saying has to be used discretly, not blindly.

00:28:38.547 --> 00:28:49.623
So you can understand, without discretion, whatever I say, how funnily you can use it, so detrimental to your growth.

00:29:06.726 --> 00:29:14.076
So, another offshoot of ego is called as ‘hot temper’.

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:27.038
Of course, it is there to be used against people who try to insult your Mother, you have to do that.

00:29:41.605 --> 00:29:48.545
That must be used for people who go against the Holy Ghost, as Christ has said.

00:30:05.672 --> 00:30:15.760
In the same way, you should not tolerate any nonsense against Me from anyone whatsoever, not even this much.

00:30:33.953 --> 00:30:40.273
But you can tolerate other Sahaja Yogis in other matters.

00:30:50.054 --> 00:31:01.279
Another enemy we have is the greed.

00:31:08.386 --> 00:31:13.785
I mean material greed...

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:17.468
or... material greed.

00:31:19.881 --> 00:31:30.145
and also human greed, like possessing your wife, possessing your children, possessing this, possessing Mataji also.

00:31:46.484 --> 00:31:49.474
This also must be surrendered.

00:31:54.114 --> 00:32:04.427
And this could be very dangerous that, “This is my child, this is my son, I must possess it,” can be very dangerous in Sahaja Yoga also.

00:32:13.847 --> 00:32:21.141
“This is my carpet, this is my camera, this is my tape-recorder.”

00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:41.314
Once you start understanding what is mine is not a truth.

00:32:41.324 --> 00:32:48.908
Nothing is mine, that’s the truth.

00:33:02.738 --> 00:33:12.919
Also some people, like I know of, they say that “my job,” or “my business,” or “my enterprise.”

00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:24.909
We had the other day, one gentleman in Geneva who was very troublesome, because he is so conscious of all these things.

00:33:35.853 --> 00:33:49.012
So the greed, also the lust of other women and indulging into lust too much,

00:33:50.202 --> 00:33:53.482
giving too much importance to the agencies of lust.

00:34:11.643 --> 00:34:18.693
That creates great problems, for not only Sahaja Yogis, but on the whole for Sahaja Yoga also.

00:34:33.026 --> 00:34:41.855
It is expressed in both types of people; those who are living in a very free world as well as people who are over-suppressed.

00:35:04.387 --> 00:35:12.923
I know of people, those who are supposed to be brought up in very religious, so called, atmosphere,

00:35:12.933 --> 00:35:17.443
when exposed to women, suddenly get too much attracted towards them.

00:35:39.143 --> 00:35:56.489
So, it’s that maturity of your innocence must be developed that keeps you a very religious person, dharmic person.

00:36:06.605 --> 00:36:17.870
And the innocence to know how far to go with men and women – that’s the wisdom of innocence.

00:36:27.342 --> 00:36:34.902
Children, if you see, they know exactly, if there’s a lady, if there’s a man, how to behave.

00:36:43.932 --> 00:36:48.135
So, the innocence is not stupidity.

00:36:49.925 --> 00:37:10.726
Is a complete wisdom, and when it matures in its full form, it just knows how to be with people without indulging into anyone of these enemies.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:38.322
Each enemy is sufficient to finish not only one person, but billions and billions.

00:37:54.904 --> 00:38:08.555
So best way to develop that absolute nature of your Vishuddhi Chakra is to witness the whole thing with a detached mind

00:38:22.684 --> 00:38:41.290
and to develop love for your Mother in your heart, so that She cleanses all these enemies in such a way that when you are faced with them you are a powerful person.

00:39:04.812 --> 00:39:16.886
Mentally, I think, most of the Sahaja Yogis understand that obedience to Divinity is the only way – mentally, rationally.

00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:29.410
Mentally.

00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:50.027
Now, even if you understand something mentally, it’s not your innate nature.

00:40:03.325 --> 00:40:10.138
So what I told you yesterday, is when you accept something mentally and you cannot do it, you feel guilty about it.

00:40:22.326 --> 00:40:27.436
Then you become your own Guru and punish yourself,

00:40:31.538 --> 00:40:38.238
and try to make this as your innate nature.

00:40:48.814 --> 00:40:57.229
It’s a state, it clicks, once it clicks you can see immediately. I know who is surrendered.

00:41:20.671 --> 00:41:29.077
So, as Shri Krishna has said that: "Sarva - dharmanam parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja."

00:41:29.097 --> 00:41:38.404
He has said: “Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to Me, surrender to My dharma only.”

00:41:50.106 --> 00:41:57.935
So the dharmas we have in our country, as we say, is a pitru dharma – what you owe to your father,

00:41:57.955 --> 00:42:04.130
matru dharma – what you owe to your mother, then your desha dharma – what you owe to your country,

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:15.337
then vishwa dharma – what you owe to the whole universe, pati dharma – what you owe to your husband, patni dharma – what you owe to your patni,

00:42:15.327 --> 00:42:21.440
like all that, you see, that relationship in which you owe to them, what you have to do.

00:42:41.955 --> 00:42:50.549
But when He says, “Surrender all these dharmas," He is meaning to say, “You should only know what you owe to Me,"

00:43:01.964 --> 00:43:03.904
meaning the Divinity.

00:43:06.604 --> 00:43:09.851
So now, Shri Krishna is not there.

00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:17.711
It’s Me who is Shri Krishna, so you must know what you owe to Me.

00:43:24.939 --> 00:43:27.539
I’ve only changed My language.

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:41.817
He used to take out His finger and say that, “Give up everything and surrender everything to Me.” I don’t do that way, I give a big lecture and bring you to a point.

00:43:58.716 --> 00:44:12.183
So, that should not divert your attention from the right goal that you have to achieve by surrendering.

00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:29.869
And it is going to work out very well with you people here, I’m sure.

00:44:29.879 --> 00:44:40.234
And one day I’ll find the whole Germans
surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
