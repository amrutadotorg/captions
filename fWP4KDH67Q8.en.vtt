00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:13.315
You have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:18.377
We cannot conceptualize it with our human
awareness.

00:00:18.457 --> 00:00:28.196
We cannot order it, we cannot manipulate it,
we cannot organize it.

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:33.310
It is what it is, has been and will be.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.288
And what is the truth?

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:50.081
Truth is that we are surrounded or we are penetrated
or we are nourished, looked after and loved

00:00:50.161 --> 00:01:00.078
by a very subtle energy which is
the energy of divine love.

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:15.280
The second truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, these conditionings, this ego,

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:20.584
but we are the spirit.

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:32.108
You don’t have to accept what I’m saying
blindly, because blind faith leads to fanaticism.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:40.705
But as scientists you must keep your minds
open and see for yourself what I’m saying:

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:46.848
if it is so, honestly you must accept it.

00:01:52.183 --> 00:02:07.511
We know so much through science about our
civilization, our advancement.

00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:15.112
This is the advancement of a tree
which has grown outside very much;

00:02:15.192 --> 00:02:23.983
but if we do not know our
roots, we’ll be destroyed.

00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:29.433
So it is important to know about our roots.

00:02:29.513 --> 00:02:38.228
And this is what it is that I would say are
our roots.

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:47.724
As you can see, there are seven centers within
us,

00:02:51.805 --> 00:03:04.423
and these subtle centers are placed in
the spinal cord and the brain.

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:13.351
These cater to our physical, mental, emotional
and spiritual needs.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.144
On the physical side they manifest
the energy for the use of our plexuses

00:03:21.224 --> 00:03:28.140
which look after our physical problems.

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:40.061
That is on the right side, the energy
which is supplied by this yellow line,

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:47.899
a subtle channel – we call it as the Pingala
Nadi –

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:54.176
this supplies energy for our physical 
and mental actions.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:05.830
So this is the power of action within us which also
caters to the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:04:06.783 --> 00:04:15.718
The another channel you see on the left-hand
side is the channel by which we desire,

00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:18.433
put our energy to our desire.

00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:25.523
So this is the power of desire and looks after
our emotions.

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:32.403
This is the one which looks after 
our conditionings also.

00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:40.594
At the end of these two channels they create
two institutions:

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:47.495
one on the right side crosses over, and
the yellow balloon that you see is the ego,

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:50.815
is the balloon of ego that we have;

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:59.393
and the left-hand side one that, which
conditions our mind is the balloon of superego.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:07.456
Now there’s third energy
within us which is in the center,

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:14.270
and this central energy is the one
which has made us human beings.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:21.461
And these centers are the milestones of our
evolution.

00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:29.936
So now the last jumping is left out.

00:05:30.302 --> 00:05:34.161
It has reached up to the limbic area.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:50.184
Now, only thing, it has to break
through the soft bone in the, on the head

00:05:52.405 --> 00:06:00.316
and break through that, which
is the actualization of baptism.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:08.820
Baptism is not an artificial thing – it
is an actualization.

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:25.102
But the energy that does it is, we call it sleeping
energy, in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:32.786
That means the Greeks knew that this is a
sacred bone, that they called it “sacrum.”

00:06:32.915 --> 00:06:41.313
This energy has to rise and break through
that fontanel bone area

00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:45.234
and connect us to that subtle divine Power

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:49.400
which we have never felt during human awareness.

00:06:54.218 --> 00:07:07.488
Thus we get connected to this divine Power,
and we start feeling it on our fingertips.
