WEBVTT

00:00.317 --> 00:08.241
We can throw some light on awareness.

00:08.241 --> 00:19.056
As I have told you before – by stopping its search
at a point by saying that we cannot go any further.

00:19.056 --> 00:29.769
In our own being, we have got the negativity
and the positivity as sympathetic and the

00:29.769 --> 00:35.248
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:35.248 --> 00:50.498
Even in the search of religion, when we start rising
our attention towards this, we start searching it

00:50.498 --> 01:02.998
outside. This is not because something wrong with
us, but this has come to us through our evolutionary

01:02.998 --> 01:10.748
habits. For example, a fish came out
and became a reptile and started crawling.

01:10.748 --> 01:16.748
It felt the soil,
the hardness of the soil and started walking.

01:16.748 --> 01:29.497
In the same way,
every evolutionary jumping has been by going out.

01:29.497 --> 01:37.248
But now the evolution has to be within,
because the last stage of the complete

01:37.248 --> 01:43.998
evolving of that instrument is built.

01:43.998 --> 01:56.998
Actually, it is now not the evolution,
but involution that has to take place.

01:56.998 --> 02:04.748
For example, I take a tape recorder from India
to Singapore and start making it, preparing the

02:04.748 --> 02:10.997
instrument, and then, I come back on the same.

02:10.997 --> 02:21.794
Recording all that has happened to
you within yourself, it is the involution.

02:21.887 --> 02:38.444
With that, the awareness of every manifestation,
which was dead in the beginning, becomes apparent.

02:38.444 --> 02:46.222
In the human being, when the ray of consciousness
passes through the prism of this brain, it gets

02:46.222 --> 02:50.830
refracted and we get three types of energies.

02:50.830 --> 02:57.831
Out of that, the sympathetic has got
two; one is the right; another is the left.

02:57.831 --> 03:03.830
The left side of the sympathetic nervous system of a
man who is right-handed (now I will be only dealing

03:03.830 --> 03:14.081
with the right-handed man),
is the storehouse of the subconscious.

03:14.081 --> 03:27.331
Or I should say it is the plug through which
we receive the intuition from our subconscious.

03:27.331 --> 03:46.581
The subconscious half is the receiving house of all
that is dead in our thoughts, in our memory, and all

03:46.581 --> 03:51.153
that is dead in the whole world.

03:51.285 --> 03:59.698
When we die, really we do not
die; most surprisingly, nothing dies.

03:59.698 --> 04:13.655
Only a very little part of our being recedes,
manifested through the element that is Earth, dies.

04:13.655 --> 04:22.155
Otherwise, we remain, in the atmosphere, in the
paralok, as they call it, (in between the hell and

04:22.155 --> 04:35.819
the heaven, you can say), in the paralok,
where you can see them if you develop those eyes.

04:35.821 --> 04:39.689
They do exist.

04:39.691 --> 04:44.188
Now, we are sitting down here, there
is another world where we have to go,

04:44.188 --> 04:46.463
leaving these clothes here.

04:46.463 --> 04:54.038
Again, we come back to this world.

04:54.038 --> 05:02.319
This paralok, or we can say the world of
the dead, exists.

05:02.319 --> 05:09.851
The difference is, while we grow here, there they
become smaller and smaller till they reach a stage

05:09.851 --> 05:21.102
where they become a small, minute stick.

05:21.102 --> 05:36.821
They have got the willpower to work
out and manifest their unfinished ideas.

05:36.821 --> 05:44.170
Supposing, a doctor who has
invented some great medicine and dies.

05:44.170 --> 05:56.920
He might manifest on someone after selecting,
and try to do good to people.

05:56.920 --> 06:05.170
In London, there is a very great organisation
of Doctor Lang who died long time back.

06:05.170 --> 06:12.420
And one day a soldier who was fighting on the
battlefield suddenly felt that somebody had entered

06:12.420 --> 06:22.540
his mind. When somebody is shocked, they can use
that moment to enter the psyche – the psyche which

06:22.540 --> 06:28.615
is the super-conscious.

06:28.615 --> 06:38.365
When he entered the body, he told the man that, “you
should go and see my son who is in London and you

06:38.365 --> 06:46.615
tell him that I will work in your body as a medium”.

06:46.615 --> 06:53.319
So he went and told the son,
the son could not believe it.

06:53.319 --> 06:59.244
So, he told him many secret things
which the son did not know and also the

06:59.244 --> 07:02.226
things that nobody knew, but the son.

07:02.226 --> 07:08.371
This convinced the son and he started
a very big organisation of Doctor Lang.

07:08.371 --> 07:15.871
I have met many people who
have been cured also by their help.

07:15.871 --> 07:23.078
Now, when one doctor connects your self to that
paralok; (for example, if I have a connection with

07:23.078 --> 07:31.750
somebody in Los Angeles, I can connect myself with
other people who are there), you can ask some other

07:31.750 --> 07:37.860
doctors to come and help to cure, to do good.

07:37.860 --> 07:45.439
This is what is known as spiritual
healing that we have in our mind.

07:45.439 --> 07:54.689
I have a disciple who was doing
this kind of work for many years.

07:54.689 --> 08:06.699
And, after about sixteen years of her doing, she
started feeling very giddy, and she came to see Me.

08:06.699 --> 08:12.318
When I asked her to put her hands towards Me,
I found she had become very sick.

08:12.318 --> 08:16.318
So, I asked her, “what was the matter?

08:16.318 --> 08:19.318
Are you doing any spiritual healing?”.

08:19.318 --> 08:27.318
Naturally, the first answer was, “How do you know,
Mataji?” I said, “Forget it.” Then I had to tell her

08:27.318 --> 08:32.817
very frankly,
“You must get rid of this on your psyche”.

08:32.817 --> 08:39.317
She is the wisest person I have yet come across
out of all those people who have been working as

08:39.317 --> 08:45.045
mediums. She said, “Mataji, I just do not want it.

08:45.045 --> 08:50.204
Please remove all this.
I just want the Supreme, the Param”.

08:50.204 --> 08:54.648
I said, “if you want it, you will get it”.

08:54.648 --> 09:01.701
She got it, and she lost her power of spiritual
healing due to which she used to shake her hand.

09:01.701 --> 09:06.952
And she got the natural curative power
and the awakening power, and she is one

09:06.952 --> 09:10.577
of the most dearest disciples of Mine.

09:10.577 --> 09:21.766
And one day she will go very far in her healing,
because of this [NOT CLEAR].

09:21.766 --> 09:29.266
So, we have people who can do good,
and they want to manifest through you.

09:29.266 --> 09:36.766
But, one must think why Doctor
Lang did not come on his own son?

09:36.766 --> 09:43.266
Because he did not want his
own son to suffer in the long run.

09:43.266 --> 09:49.266
When anyone acts as medium,
he is no good for Sahaja Yoga.

09:49.266 --> 09:51.516
You are not independent.

09:51.516 --> 09:59.266
First, you have to be completely independent of all
these astral aspirations on you, and then only you

09:59.266 --> 10:07.516
can feel the beauty, the glory, of your own being.

10:07.516 --> 10:21.170
A person who is in the shackles cannot be
made the King and requested to take the throne.

10:21.209 --> 10:27.715
In our country, we have had from ages, people
working on the “mohini vidya” (hypnosis) and the

10:27.715 --> 10:30.241
“paralok vidya” (another world).

10:30.241 --> 10:35.007
And in America,
I have seen people having witchcraft.

10:35.007 --> 10:40.716
One thing great about American
people is that they are absolutely honest.

10:40.716 --> 10:44.216
If they are doing witchcraft,
they say we are doing witchcraft.

10:44.216 --> 10:50.466
They won’t take up another name
and the witch won’t call oneself a Devi.

10:50.466 --> 10:58.216
They won’t do like that.

10:58.216 --> 11:08.716
Now, this kind of working is,
how it is worked out, is a very lengthy thing.

11:08.716 --> 11:17.466
But, I can tell you in a short way.

11:17.466 --> 11:29.706
As I have told you, the libido, which contains all
that is dead in you, all your subconscious mind,

11:29.706 --> 11:35.537
is connected with your solar plexus directly.

11:35.537 --> 11:47.602
In the same way, the right-hand side and the
left-hand side, both sympathetic nervous systems,

11:47.602 --> 11:53.102
are connected with your solar plexus,
the Manipur chakra, directly.

11:53.102 --> 12:00.732
Any doctor can guarantee that and can say that,
if it is.

12:00.732 --> 12:07.666
But unluckily,
the parasympathetic is hanging above.

12:07.666 --> 12:21.912
The vagus nerve, which plays the most important part
in carrying the Kundalini into the backbone,

12:21.951 --> 12:29.417
has a void, between the solar
plexus and the vagus nerve.

12:29.417 --> 12:36.054
This void has been described in the great systems of
religion, and people have written books after books.

12:36.054 --> 12:44.136
So, as soon as your attention even goes to religion,
you start growing on to your sympathetic nervous

12:44.136 --> 12:49.111
system, either to the right or to the left.

12:49.111 --> 12:57.611
By growing to the right side of the sympathetic
nervous system, of course in the right-handed man,

12:57.611 --> 13:02.861
you go to the libido.

13:02.861 --> 13:11.752
Libido is connected from sex point, up to the
“muddha” (medulla oblongata?) that is the place

13:11.752 --> 13:21.741
below the brain,
which touches your Agyna chakra here.

13:21.741 --> 13:32.491
So, by doing any effort, you may get into that trap
of getting into the libido – which is a connection

13:32.491 --> 13:38.240
already existing between you,
with yourself and the Parama.

13:38.240 --> 13:55.741
The other side is the sympathetic nervous system
which is waiting for you to act to any emergency.

13:55.741 --> 14:01.832
If there is any emergency, as I told you yesterday,
if there is an irritation in the hand, it will start

14:01.832 --> 14:08.062
acting so much so, that it will overact,
and a malignancy can be created.

14:08.062 --> 14:12.312
See now both the things,
how they are for your destruction.

14:12.312 --> 14:19.562
Now, when you see people being mesmerised – those
who are honest say that we are mesmerisers and we

14:19.562 --> 14:24.061
have this hypnotists and all that, very honest
people are there also in this world, everybody is

14:24.061 --> 14:29.812
not a cheat. So, they tell plainly that we
are the people who are going to hypnotise.

14:29.812 --> 14:39.073
When they hypnotise, you get suddenly submerged
into your subconscious mind, the conscious mind gets

14:39.073 --> 14:46.380
submerged into it,
and you become unconscious to the outside world.

14:46.380 --> 14:56.350
And there you start acting according to the
demands of the person who is hypnotising you.

14:56.350 --> 14:58.944
Now, why do you do that?

14:58.944 --> 15:01.944
If he says you start jumping,
you will start jumping.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.444
If he says you start feeling sick,
you start feeling giddy.

15:05.454 --> 15:14.085
If he says that you start counting one thousand,
from one to one thousand, you will start doing it.

15:14.087 --> 15:18.196
There was a girl who was very
anxious to go for a thing like that

15:18.196 --> 15:19.947
and she asked and I said, “Please do not go”.

15:19.947 --> 15:23.447
She would not listen – she went
there, and the gentleman asked her

15:23.447 --> 15:25.568
to count from one to one thousand.

15:25.568 --> 15:30.573
She was a very innocent girl,
and I knew what had happened to her.

15:30.573 --> 15:39.074
So, I went to see her just after
that and I found that she had fainted.

15:39.074 --> 15:44.573
This is like, switching off your mind – the
conscious mind, with which you are listening to Me

15:44.573 --> 15:46.573
is just get switched off.

15:46.573 --> 15:51.824
You can also go to a subconscious.

15:51.824 --> 15:57.515
Any movement towards sympathetic
is against parasympathetic nervous

15:57.515 --> 15:59.765
system and against Kundalini.

15:59.765 --> 16:06.265
Ida and Pingala are the two sympathetic nervous
systems on which people have been working.

16:06.265 --> 16:11.015
And that is the reason they have never
been able to get their self-realisation.

16:11.015 --> 16:17.424
Because for parasympathetic nervous system,
you must fill the Void with Divine Love.

16:17.424 --> 16:25.335
By mechanical working, you cannot get to God,
is a simple fact you must understand.

16:25.361 --> 16:28.804
[Inaudible question or comment from a seeker].

16:28.817 --> 16:34.174
Shri Mataji: I am happy you told Me.

16:34.174 --> 16:53.710
Now, that we are connected with the libido through
our efforts, when a person starts weeping and crying

16:53.710 --> 17:03.210
for God, he might see that the garland
from the deity is coming and garland himself.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.452
It’s quite possible.

17:04.452 --> 17:07.839
There is nothing to be so much surprised.

17:07.839 --> 17:13.277
Depends on how much he is
in connection with the paralok.

17:13.277 --> 17:19.527
There are so many saints who are not realised,
who have died and want to say that there is God.

17:19.527 --> 17:21.528
They can work it out.

17:21.528 --> 17:26.607
But if they are realised people they will
never enter into the psyche of those persons.

17:26.607 --> 17:31.092
They may give them certain indications like that.

17:31.092 --> 17:37.342
But, they will never enter the psyche, if they are
realised people because they have achieved their

17:37.342 --> 17:45.278
independence and they respect
the independence of others.

17:45.278 --> 17:52.095
Now, if you see the sympathetic nervous system, how
it is worked out; you will be surprised, that the

17:52.095 --> 18:01.095
symptom of the sympathetic nervous system is – you
get more breathing, more pulse rate, more heartbeat

18:01.095 --> 18:10.095
and constriction of your intestine,
which leads to constipation and things like that.

18:10.095 --> 18:21.845
So, the mohini vidya, the way they learn it – first
of all, they master the evil geniuses who have died.

18:21.845 --> 18:31.753
If they come to know of someone who is an evil
genius, such people who want to benefit by their

18:31.755 --> 18:40.723
evil methods, wait for their death, and go into
the “shmashanas” (funeral grounds) when they die.

18:40.723 --> 18:49.166
Because the dead – when they die, the body remains,
but the Atma hovers; at least for thirteen days.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.416
It does not take birth immediately.

18:51.416 --> 18:57.166
Some people take even five hundred
years because they are [inaudible].

18:57.166 --> 19:04.916
So, that spirit which is hovering there is caught up
by these people through their libido and they take

19:04.916 --> 19:12.666
away some part of that spirit by
removing a part of the dead matter.

19:12.666 --> 19:15.666
For example, they may take out the skull bone.

19:15.666 --> 19:22.666
They may even take the ashes of that (the dead),
because when the soul has to be reborn, he has to

19:22.666 --> 19:25.058
have that complete body.

19:25.156 --> 19:33.701
For that those ashes are required, and if these
ashes are kept in control by these people, then they

19:33.701 --> 19:39.487
(evil spirits) will be born with lame hands
or lame legs and there will be a problem.

19:39.487 --> 19:45.487
So, they go on hovering there and then, they
(evil spirits) surrender themselves and accept their

19:45.487 --> 19:49.987
domination completely.

19:49.987 --> 19:55.737
Now, these people come out in the public
and announce that we can show you miracles.

19:55.737 --> 19:56.846
They can, why not?

19:56.846 --> 20:02.429
Because, for us miracles are something foolish.

20:02.429 --> 20:10.429
For example, a relation of Mine came and
told Me that some sadhuji has given him a ring.

20:10.429 --> 20:13.179
I laughed at him and said,
“How many rings have you got?”.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.429
He is a very rich man.

20:14.429 --> 20:15.679
He said, “I have ten diamond rings”.

20:15.679 --> 20:18.179
I said, “He has given you the eleventh ring.

20:18.179 --> 20:20.429
Did you go to ask for the ring?”.

20:20.429 --> 20:24.678
He said, “No, no,
I went to ask him for something very Divine”.

20:24.678 --> 20:26.631
I said, “Then why did you accept this ring?

20:26.698 --> 20:30.558
You should have thrown out.” You
should have told that I do not want this ring.

20:30.558 --> 20:33.557
“Why did you accept?”.

20:33.557 --> 20:38.558
He said, ”All right, now I don’t care for it,
but you do something about it”.

20:38.558 --> 20:41.808
Now, these are the experiments we have carried out,
you can also come and see.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.307
It is all open to you.

20:43.307 --> 20:47.808
It is a laboratory which is open to all of you,
to come and see with open mind.

20:47.808 --> 20:49.308
Not just to sneer and to laugh at.

20:49.308 --> 20:55.558
But to see, with understanding,
to do good to the whole humanity.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.058
So, I told him.

20:57.058 --> 20:59.558
He said that, “now You give Me realisation”.

20:59.558 --> 21:00.719
I said, “I cannot”.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.626
He said, “Why?” I said,
“you will have to remove that ring”.

21:03.626 --> 21:05.125
He said, “I will not”.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.876
Then, I said, “I cannot give you the realisation”.

21:06.876 --> 21:11.126
Then when I started; I told him, “Alright,
you put your hands towards Me”.

21:11.126 --> 21:13.351
And he started shaking.

21:13.351 --> 21:14.409
He said, “What is this?

21:14.409 --> 21:15.191
Why am I shaking?”.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.941
I said, “Now you take out the ring”.

21:16.941 --> 21:20.650
Immediately shaking stopped.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.629
He said, “Throw this away”.

21:22.629 --> 21:29.379
I said, “You must know that ring you can buy in
the market, but can you purchase the Divine in the

21:29.379 --> 21:32.762
market? Why don’t you use your brain?

21:35.656 --> 21:35.756
You are a very intelligent man.

21:35.756 --> 21:38.756
What has happened to you?”

21:38.756 --> 21:42.006
All such “miracles” are working.

21:42.006 --> 21:48.006
The other day, most surprising that it should
happen at such a juncture when I was to speak on the

21:48.006 --> 21:54.256
subject, that one gentleman, Mr Sharma from Punjab,
came and was asking about Mataji.

21:54.256 --> 21:58.506
And some of My people were there and they said,
“What is the age of Mataji?.

21:58.506 --> 21:59.756
They said, “She is fifty”.

21:59.756 --> 22:04.506
“No, but I know of one Mataji who is four years
old and she calls herself something and all the

22:04.506 --> 22:06.256
[inaudible/cinema] people are after her.

22:06.256 --> 22:09.005
What about her, where is she?”.They said,
“We do not know”.

22:09.005 --> 22:11.756
He started making a lot of inquiries about her.

22:11.756 --> 22:16.006
So they thought he is from CBI (Central
Bureau of Investigation) or what is he doing.

22:16.006 --> 22:20.756
Then they said, “Now, you come here
tomorrow for meditation and you will meet Mataji”.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.506
Somehow or other, I again came back here.

22:23.506 --> 22:27.756
And he saw Me and said, “No, no, no,
no – this is not the Mataji I am talking about”.

22:27.756 --> 22:34.506
Then he tells Me, there was one boy, one gentleman
who came to see Me and told him that, “you invest

22:34.506 --> 22:40.775
one thousand rupees or one thousand
five hundred rupees in this new venture.

22:40.775 --> 22:42.641
It is an enterprise.

22:42.641 --> 22:45.641
You please deposit this money with me.

22:45.641 --> 22:51.384
And I can assure you, I will return you,
double amount of it, within one month’s time”.

22:51.384 --> 22:56.018
He said, “How?” He said, ”I have a daughter
who is four-year-old and she is doing miracles”.

22:56.018 --> 23:00.511
He saw with his own eyes that she
is taking out this and that from the air.

23:00.511 --> 23:07.145
Now the four-year-old child cannot do
anything positive, I mean consciously.

23:07.145 --> 23:10.629
But, the little child was picking out
this; whatever you ask her, she is doing

23:10.631 --> 23:13.355
like this and giving out like this.

23:13.355 --> 23:17.252
So he was wonderstruck, and he gave the
money; immediately forward with the money.

23:17.252 --> 23:21.209
Now the person has, he told Me that,
“the gentleman had disappeared and when I read

23:21.209 --> 23:23.709
the name Mataji, I came to inquire”.

23:23.709 --> 23:26.209
I said, “I do not need any money from you.

23:26.209 --> 23:28.046
But thank God you are here.

23:28.046 --> 23:29.765
Tomorrow you come for your meditation.

23:29.765 --> 23:32.774
Perhaps one thousand five
hundred is not such a great amount.

23:32.774 --> 23:39.781
If you can get your self-realisation,
you are saved forever”.

23:39.781 --> 23:47.901
Now, in My search to find out the method how to
impart this awareness of Mine to others, I have been

23:47.901 --> 23:50.654
to several of these gurus.

23:50.654 --> 23:57.527
Some of them I will try to describe,
and now you use your brains and see what happens.

23:57.527 --> 24:05.277
First of all, in My childhood, My father told Me
there is a sadhu/fakir who has come and who is doing

24:05.277 --> 24:08.027
some great miracles.

24:08.027 --> 24:11.027
So, I went to see the gentleman.

24:11.027 --> 24:16.027
And what I found; he had a “chimta”
(tongs) in his hands, you know chimta?

24:16.027 --> 24:19.277
There is no word for that in English, I think.

24:19.277 --> 24:24.277
So he was using that hard thing to
hit every person who came to him.

24:24.277 --> 24:27.777
Then I said,
“What sort of a person he is – I just cannot bear.

24:27.777 --> 24:29.277
It’s impossible”.

24:29.277 --> 24:36.277
Actually what he was doing was to hit the man,
and put one devil on him, another devil on the other

24:36.277 --> 24:40.221
person. After some time,
I found people took out their rings, took out their

24:40.221 --> 24:44.410
everything and surrendered to him.

24:44.410 --> 24:49.910
I immediately put My hands towards him
and found out that he was a negative person.

24:49.910 --> 24:52.205
How do you make out a negative personality?

24:52.205 --> 24:54.475
That also I am going to tell.

24:54.475 --> 24:55.975
Very easy.

24:55.975 --> 24:58.975
I must give you all the tricks.

24:58.975 --> 25:06.475
Then I went to another person in Haridwar.

25:06.475 --> 25:16.725
He was doing wonderful
miracles in My father-in-law’s place.

25:16.725 --> 25:19.725
As soon as he saw Me, he started shivering.

25:19.725 --> 25:21.975
Absolutely shivering.

25:21.975 --> 25:23.104
He said, “Mother, Mother”.

25:23.104 --> 25:26.354
I said, “What are you doing?” He said,
“I want to get rid of it.

25:26.354 --> 25:27.854
Please save me from all this.

25:27.854 --> 25:31.853
I am now sick, I am absolutely finished,
please save me from this”.

25:31.853 --> 25:36.246
I said, “Are you sure you are finished with this?”.

25:36.246 --> 25:40.717
He said, “Yes”.

25:40.717 --> 25:46.357
You will be surprised; within five
minutes he got rid of his maladies.

25:46.357 --> 25:58.357
And he got his realisation later on,
much later; about two years back.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.353
In the same way, I went to Pune –

26:00.353 --> 26:01.821
there was one gentleman, a “mantrika”

26:01.821 --> 26:03.110
(tantric) who came to see Me.

26:03.110 --> 26:04.969
Same time.

26:04.969 --> 26:10.299
He was staying with one Mr More and he told Me that,
“Mataji, now I am fed up of this.

26:10.299 --> 26:16.548
I have cured many people. But now my head is
very heavy and please save Me from all this”.

26:16.548 --> 26:20.175
So I asked him, “Have you decided
to give up all that forever?”

26:20.177 --> 26:22.813
He said, “Mataji, save me in this life.

26:22.891 --> 26:26.515
I am not going to use that medium anymore.
Now I can see that separately .

26:26.515 --> 26:32.302
In the beginning, I did not know that it
was a medium my guru had put on me.

26:32.302 --> 26:35.802
Now I am seeing it separately,
I can see my guru also sometimes.

26:35.802 --> 26:39.177
But I cannot sleep day and night.
I am having a terrible time.

26:39.177 --> 26:42.160
I said, “If you are sure,
then you are going to get realisation.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.805
Don’t you worry”

26:44.805 --> 26:48.617
And he got his realisation within five minutes.

26:48.625 --> 26:54.717
Surprisingly. Perhaps because he was
really fed up and he was very honest.

26:54.717 --> 26:58.632
I told him, “You have lost all your
power of seeing things, of telling things”.

26:58.632 --> 27:00.431
He used to tell the future, he could see things.

27:00.431 --> 27:06.013
He used to tell them where is your father is gone,
where is your son is lost.

27:06.013 --> 27:10.557
So he went out and told Mr. More that,
“How is it possible, Mataji is saying

27:10.557 --> 27:13.496
that She has taken away all my siddhis.
It is not possible.

27:13.496 --> 27:18.246
Because, I have done this for twenty-five years”.

27:18.246 --> 27:20.996
He said, “Alright, then you start your mantras”.

27:20.996 --> 27:25.496
Within five minutes he found
out he had lost all his powers.

27:25.496 --> 27:31.311
Then More told him, “Don’t you worry.
Now, you have got the Divine quality .

27:31.311 --> 27:37.561
Be joyous and happy that this Divine is flowing,
and that you are doing it even

27:37.561 --> 27:40.061
without feeling that you are doing it.

27:40.061 --> 27:47.311
What a great joy – stand in your own dignity and
independence, and do not depend on this foolish

27:47.311 --> 27:51.811
material things which are going to die”.

27:51.811 --> 27:57.755
But, the negativity which incarnates as rakshasas
do not have one thing in them that we have –

27:57.757 --> 28:02.441
that is Love. They have no love for anyone.

28:02.441 --> 28:05.441
Then in the course of My search,
I went to so many people.

28:05.441 --> 28:07.021
They said you become my disciple.

28:07.023 --> 28:09.878
I said, “All right.
I will become your disciple”.

28:09.878 --> 28:13.254
I went to one gentleman.
He said, “You have to take sanyasa”.

28:13.254 --> 28:16.005
I said, “that I will not do”.
He said, “Why?”

28:16.005 --> 28:17.669
I said, “Because I am a sanyasini”.

28:17.671 --> 28:20.402
He said, “That is true. But still,
You have to take the dress (ochre robes)”.

28:20.402 --> 28:22.881
I said, “I will not”.
He said, “Why”?.

28:22.881 --> 28:30.632
I said, “it will hurt My Heart, it will hurt My
family, it will hurt My mother, father, everyone.

28:30.632 --> 28:34.661
Why do you want Me to
hurt them for nothing at all?”

28:34.661 --> 28:42.016
So, he immediately started
mesmerising Me with sympathy.

28:42.016 --> 28:45.786
He said, “But are you happy with your husband?
Is he treating you all right?”.

28:45.786 --> 28:50.971
I said, “You do not know how he treats Me.”

28:50.971 --> 28:55.112
Then he started another trick, “Let him cry.
Let him weep. What is he going to do?

28:55.112 --> 28:58.450
After all, he will cry, weep and he'll be alright.”

28:58.450 --> 29:04.887
I was surprised. That he could not
even see the love I have for My husband,

29:04.887 --> 29:07.151
and the respect I have for him.

29:07.151 --> 29:13.325
The way he suggested – I told him, “How dare you
say such things against My husband whom I have known

29:13.325 --> 29:15.418
for twenty-five years now?

29:15.418 --> 29:21.353
And you want Me to accept this nonsensical
thing on My body, hurting all My family people.

29:21.353 --> 29:28.641
You have no love for mankind”.

29:28.641 --> 29:34.518
There are people who go and threaten their parents
that, “If you do not give us money, we will take to

29:34.518 --> 29:38.268
sanyas. We will die.
We will become nude”.

29:38.268 --> 29:46.018
It’s another way of expressing your
shabbiness towards your parents.

29:46.018 --> 29:51.268
Our younger people if they think by revolting
against their parents and by hurting them and

29:51.268 --> 29:56.518
troubling them, they are becoming very beautiful –
they should know that that is not the way to do it.

29:56.518 --> 30:01.518
Those who cannot love their parents
cannot love anybody in this whole world.

30:01.518 --> 30:06.518
All the blessings of the world
come through your parents only.

30:06.518 --> 30:12.621
Those who have denied their parents – of course, if
the parents are telling you something wrong,

30:12.621 --> 30:19.212
I can understand. But, you should not
deliberately go and hurt them all the time.

30:19.212 --> 30:24.212
We have examples of such children in
this country – this great country of nine;

30:24.212 --> 30:27.961
where their vibrations are everywhere.

30:27.961 --> 30:34.237
We have heard of Shravan.

30:34.237 --> 30:42.215
The complete Vithala’s temple is built
on the devotion of one person, is there.

30:42.215 --> 30:51.965
These (negative) people teach you to revolt
against all that is beautiful that God has given.

30:51.967 --> 30:57.647
This is the first way they hit you by telling you
against your parents, against your husband,

30:57.696 --> 31:04.034
against your wife, they want to break all your shackles.

31:04.034 --> 31:06.573
This is not the way.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.994
Religion is based on Love.

31:08.994 --> 31:10.357
And how do they do it?

31:10.357 --> 31:15.783
By putting these evil spirits on you.

31:15.783 --> 31:22.533
By which you bring money for them and
surrender all that you have at their feet.

31:22.533 --> 31:26.783
And they enjoy the luxuries of life.

31:26.783 --> 31:29.783
Even they are such foolish people.

31:29.783 --> 31:42.783
Why don’t they understand that there is
no joy in luxuries and in transitory fame?

31:42.783 --> 31:48.033
There was another sadhuji who told Me that,
“You were my wife in my last life”.

31:48.033 --> 31:52.788
I said, “Wonderful.
I do not see that way about you”.

31:52.788 --> 31:59.539
It’s a very common thing with many sadhus who
handle women – you see, women are simple women.

31:59.539 --> 32:05.539
If somebody tells them against their husbands, they
feel, yes, yes, there is somebody who sympathises.

32:05.539 --> 32:09.038
With a little sympathy,
you can win a woman, poor thing.

32:09.038 --> 32:12.039
So he tells Me you were my wife in my last life.

32:12.039 --> 32:17.730
I told him, “Sir, last life is dead and gone.

32:17.730 --> 32:22.168
If you are asking Me to do something because
you were My husband in My last life,

32:22.168 --> 32:27.476
what about the present one whom I have married?

32:27.476 --> 32:34.991
What do you think of this one?”

32:34.991 --> 32:38.233
This made him very furious, of course.

32:38.233 --> 32:52.803
I said, “To Me, apart from My husband,
all are My children including you”.

32:52.909 --> 32:58.934
Then, there are other ways of approaching people.

32:58.934 --> 33:07.675
It’s by taking advantage of their weak side.

33:07.675 --> 33:16.425
To mesmerise in such a way that their
subconscious automatically starts dominating them.

33:16.425 --> 33:20.425
First of all, you ask somebody to breathe heavily.

33:20.425 --> 33:26.925
As soon as you start breathing heavily, you go
onto the sympathetic trigger; is an automatic thing.

33:26.925 --> 33:31.925
And then immediately you
mesmerise the person with the devil.

33:31.925 --> 33:36.175
You give that person a necklace
which has got a devil sitting on that.

33:36.175 --> 33:43.675
Now this devil goes home with that
gentleman and tells everything that is happening.

33:43.675 --> 33:49.506
We had a lady in our group – in our own group,

33:49.506 --> 33:54.332
who was suffering already from astral trouble.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.057
She came to Me.

33:57.057 --> 34:00.769
In the beginning, you see,
I did not want to start this topic at all.

34:00.769 --> 34:05.122
Thanks to her, that now I am so open about it.

34:05.122 --> 34:10.059
She came to Me and she told Me,
“Mataji, I can see your past”.

34:10.059 --> 34:17.729
I could find, first time,
that there is a devil sitting on her.

34:17.729 --> 34:21.394
If not a devil, a saint.
But you are not independent.

34:21.394 --> 34:27.887
Without realisation,
if you are seeing anything, it is no good.

34:27.887 --> 34:33.264
First of all such a person ever gets – there are
only two cases within our group who got such a

34:33.264 --> 34:36.742
horrible “jagruti” (awakening)
shaking and all that.

34:36.742 --> 34:42.457
Both of them were absolutely intense.

34:42.457 --> 34:45.814
So she took up the courage into herself.
And when I went away to America,

34:45.814 --> 34:51.264
she started telling everybody – I am this. I am
an incarnation of this, I am an incarnation of that.

34:51.264 --> 34:53.526
And what was she telling?

34:53.526 --> 34:55.801
Where is your son lost?

34:55.801 --> 34:58.684
Where is your money lost?

34:58.684 --> 35:03.643
And all the people who have realisation
from Me started losing their vibrations.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.249
They did not understand why it was happening.

35:06.249 --> 35:10.819
so, then one of them just thought, “Is she realised?”.

35:10.819 --> 35:18.216
And when he tried found out she was not realised
but she was giving them past, terrible past.

35:18.216 --> 35:27.352
So he took up the whole thing into his
hands and he told people that, “you must

35:27.352 --> 35:31.855
see what is the interest of the Divine?

35:31.855 --> 35:37.728
Is the Divine interested in
telling you what was your father?

35:37.728 --> 35:40.611
When you had so many
fathers in your previous lives?

35:40.611 --> 35:47.995
Or where did you lose your money or whether you are
going to get money in the “satta” (card gambling)”?

35:47.995 --> 35:56.198
Such people are very good at
telling you the number of the horse.

35:56.198 --> 36:06.221
Not of the future, but they go and find
out from the jockey, through their medium.

36:06.221 --> 36:11.601
So this lady started doing this.

36:11.601 --> 36:17.004
And when I came back,
I found most of My disciples had a heavy head.

36:17.004 --> 36:23.862
I said, “What have you been doing?” And when I saw
the lady, I found out Myself, within Myself, that

36:23.862 --> 36:32.730
she was very crudely handling the
astral body by beating them up with a stick.

36:32.730 --> 36:36.674
This is not possible for a self-realised person.

36:36.674 --> 36:43.387
Even to the greatest evil genius, they cannot.

36:43.389 --> 36:52.939
This, like Krishna they may just kill the body, that
is different, but they can never beat up the person.

36:52.949 --> 36:59.921
And all these astral bodies took a revenge
on her and they were all settled in her house.

36:59.921 --> 37:04.526
Now she started telling people what happened
yesterday in your house, what happened day before

37:04.526 --> 37:08.338
yesterday, who I was in the past and all that.

37:08.338 --> 37:15.588
It can be to such a limit, that one of our sessions
we had in Daadar, which many people have seen,

37:15.588 --> 37:21.400
at least one hundred people must have been there, that
one maidservant, who was an ordinary Maharashtrian

37:21.413 --> 37:27.766
maidservant, had come for My darshan and she started
shaking, and the lady who was near her started shaking.

37:27.819 --> 37:31.591
So, I just caught hold of her hand
and I asked her, “Why are you here”.

37:31.591 --> 37:37.341
She changed her tone and started speaking
beautiful Marathi and using Sanskrit words.

37:37.341 --> 37:39.840
She said, “I am here for Your darshan”.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.375
So, all the people around started asking, “Who is
Mataji, and why have you come for her darshan?”

37:43.375 --> 37:52.575
You will be surprised she gave a lecture in fifty
shlokas all describing about Me and My past lives.

37:52.575 --> 37:56.610
I said, “Will you go from this woman or not?”

37:56.610 --> 37:59.898
She said, “I have come to sing your
praise and to let people know who you are”.

37:59.898 --> 38:03.581
I said, “You better not worry about
that and you better go away from here”.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.208
This is the truth in which people have seen.

38:06.208 --> 38:12.055
You will also see this. If you come to Me
regularly, many things like this.

38:12.055 --> 38:19.341
So when I told her that, “I do not need your help –
you take your rebirth and come back,

38:19.341 --> 38:23.912
and you take your realisation”,
she accepted.

38:23.912 --> 38:27.045
Since that day that lady is alright.

38:27.047 --> 38:31.453
She is perfectly alright.

38:31.478 --> 38:35.772
My daughter’s ayah once in the night was going.

38:35.772 --> 38:39.648
So I told her, “Not to go in the night, about 12
o’clock, these days the atmosphere in the Bombay is

38:39.660 --> 38:43.570
very much spoiled by rakshasas”.

38:43.572 --> 38:46.085
She didn’t believe Me, she went out and
next day My daughter rang Me up -

38:46.085 --> 38:51.542
“Mummy, what to do, she is vomiting too much, and she
is feeling terrible, and she is shaking her body”.

38:51.542 --> 38:56.542
I said, “You ask her to put her hands
towards the sea and call My name”.

38:56.542 --> 39:00.824
She got all right in five.

39:00.824 --> 39:06.171
And when she came back she told Me that “There are
two persons who went out of my body and I saw you

39:06.171 --> 39:15.161
sitting there with a garland and all those things”.

39:15.161 --> 39:22.324
So many psychological cases which doctors cannot
cure, or most of the incurable diseases

39:22.324 --> 39:26.860
are because of astral aspirations.

39:26.860 --> 39:39.635
And the more you allow these rakshasas to continue
their work in this great city of Mumbadevi,

39:39.635 --> 39:51.924
of Mahalaxmi, there are more chances of getting
these people let out free to harm your children.

39:51.924 --> 40:01.686
There is another Babaji who puts people into
trance. He makes the people starve for two weeks.

40:01.686 --> 40:09.427
Now if there is somebody who is non-vegetarian. He says you
must strictly stick to vegetarian, you must take only to curd.

40:09.427 --> 40:15.437
Now the person is weak, and suddenly he puts
mesmerism on that, and another devil is put onto

40:15.437 --> 40:19.246
that, and this person starts shaking
and says I have got the vibrations.

40:19.246 --> 40:24.930
But in Nasik, one of his disciples was very
courageous and she told Me, “Mataji, though he says

40:24.930 --> 40:27.374
these are divine, I don’t believe him.

40:27.374 --> 40:36.101
Because I don’t eat fats, I get a terrible headache,
and there is no place of any joy within myself

40:36.101 --> 40:38.434
which Your disciples are enjoying”.

40:38.434 --> 40:45.268
There is another type who puts the devil through this --

40:45.268 --> 40:50.447
the ones who put through this Manipur chakra
are of course, much more dangerous.

40:50.447 --> 40:53.664
Because they give you to eat
some ashes; the bhoot goes inside.

40:53.664 --> 40:56.219
You eat the ashes with difficulty.

40:56.219 --> 41:03.437
Such people have given burning on the hand, so much
so that they have developed blisters on their hand.

41:03.437 --> 41:08.017
Our Patanjali [inaudible/Sethi?] who has written
an article on him has himself burnt his hand.

41:08.017 --> 41:14.330
There are so many who can tell you about this.

41:14.330 --> 41:25.338
So the mesmerism, very genuinely granted by
these people, only helps them to accumulate wealth.

41:25.338 --> 41:29.328
Now this gentleman was in America when I was there.

41:29.328 --> 41:36.505
So, one day, I just went to see a public garden,
where they were so many of his disciples

41:36.513 --> 41:39.074
were distributing the handbills and all.

41:39.074 --> 41:43.486
So, I asked Chandubhai to collect
some of them and I would like to see.

41:43.566 --> 41:49.313
So, Chandubhai, who is an expert now,
he said, “Mataji, all their Agnya chakras

41:49.330 --> 41:52.745
are turning in the opposite direction”.

41:52.745 --> 41:57.758
If there is any lunatic person, if you see any
lunatic person, if you are realised, you will know

41:57.758 --> 42:04.312
how to know the Agyna chakra’s movement, you
will find, all the lunatics have their Agnya chakras

42:04.312 --> 42:07.939
turning in the opposite direction.

42:07.939 --> 42:14.271
Nothing has happened to the Kundalini, but the
chakra is moved on the sympathetic side,

42:14.271 --> 42:19.850
through which the libido is contacted,
and you are dominated by a bhoot.

42:19.850 --> 42:21.802
So I took aside one gentleman.

42:21.802 --> 42:27.421
He said, “No, I am already spoiled by him. He has
given me a thing here which I must have every day”.

42:27.421 --> 42:38.947
And the fellow was absolutely
nervous and perspiring immediately.

42:38.947 --> 42:46.765
This gentleman, I believe, later on, collected so
much money in America, poor Americans, I tell you,

42:46.765 --> 42:53.375
sometimes I feel so sorry because
they are very genuine people.

42:53.375 --> 43:01.529
He has taken away even the last pie of so many of
people from there and has brought them here like mad

43:01.529 --> 43:10.329
people, they are washing his clothes, they
are washing his feet, they are doing everything.

43:10.329 --> 43:17.958
How can a man who is spiritually alert have so
much attention towards his food, his clothes, his

43:17.958 --> 43:23.582
belongings, his possessions?

43:23.582 --> 43:28.401
Except for the beauty aspect of the matter,
the rest is all useless.

43:28.401 --> 43:30.386
Is a headache.

43:30.386 --> 43:36.517
It is headache to have many things.

43:36.517 --> 43:41.859
But, you cannot tell the people who are mesmerised.
If you tell them, they just walk off.

43:41.859 --> 43:45.494
They won’t listen, do nothing, will be deaf.

43:45.494 --> 43:50.428
It’s a sign of a temperament which
refuses everything that is positive.

43:50.428 --> 43:55.481
“Oh, hum to kush hain, hum anand mein
hain” – we are very happy, we are in joy.

43:55.481 --> 44:01.424
There are some gurus who put
you into trance for six-seven hours.

44:01.424 --> 44:04.038
What is all this nonsense going?

44:04.038 --> 44:09.661
Is it possible to be only in trance for
seven hours and later on you could be you?

44:09.661 --> 44:11.148
Your normal self?

44:11.148 --> 44:11.847
No.

44:11.847 --> 44:14.685
If you are realised, you are realised forever.

44:14.685 --> 44:20.190
For every moment you are realised and that time,
all the time you are meditative.

44:20.190 --> 44:24.234
There is not a single moment when
you are not collectively conscious.

44:24.234 --> 44:30.368
Supposing one these people if they are travelling
by train, suddenly they find heaviness.

44:30.368 --> 44:37.976
A person standing in front has got his Kundalini up there.

44:37.976 --> 44:46.470
We had a nice music party in Bordi ,
where two-three people had come.

44:46.470 --> 44:50.816
And when the musicians started singing,
their Kundalini rose up.

44:50.816 --> 44:54.527
Of course, I was not there for the realisation,
but their Kundalini rose up.

44:54.527 --> 44:58.778
And it became very heavy because
they had some astral sitting on them.

44:58.778 --> 45:05.006
And they didn’t know that they started
looking like that and they started shaking.

45:05.006 --> 45:06.435
And they couldn’t understand.

45:06.435 --> 45:13.255
It is sometimes so comical.
The way people start acting.

45:13.255 --> 45:19.585
Because the bhoots and the devils
have no sense of decency in them.

45:19.585 --> 45:24.693
They even hover around small children.

45:24.693 --> 45:36.468
They make you so slavish towards them that
you start behaving in the most obnoxious manner.

45:36.468 --> 45:44.338
Imagine, a good girl from a good family becoming
naked – and her photos being sold in America at a

45:44.338 --> 45:46.743
very high price.

45:46.743 --> 45:52.064
People say that it is better to see a cabaret
dance for free like this, than to pay so much for a

45:52.135 --> 45:55.614
cabaret dance in a bar.

45:55.614 --> 45:59.071
Is it dharma by any chance, you just think it over.

45:59.071 --> 46:03.870
What has happened to your brains?

46:03.870 --> 46:06.730
Now these rakshasas,

46:06.730 --> 46:09.369
if I describe, you will be shocked how they behave.

46:09.369 --> 46:15.113
And in this Kaliyuga, how can they come,
as Ravana or Mahishasura they came here.

46:15.113 --> 46:21.405
Ravana was a very powerful preacher
and had a very big library of his own.

46:21.407 --> 46:31.112
And with his speech he used to mesmerise the people
such a lot that they used to go into horrible states.

46:31.126 --> 46:34.046
He had that power within.

46:34.046 --> 46:39.887
And when Sita would not allow him
to come close to her,

46:39.887 --> 46:44.043
he could not, because of Her holiness and chastity.

46:44.043 --> 46:47.162
And Her divine powers.

46:47.162 --> 46:51.373
He used to threaten Her that in My
next life I will come and destroy the

46:51.373 --> 46:56.339
chastity of every woman of your country.

46:56.339 --> 47:11.179
All this: Mahishasura when murdered and killed, by
his own deeds, by Mother Kali, has promised all his

47:11.179 --> 47:15.245
people who were killed that, Let me be
reborn in the Kaliyuga, and I will see

47:15.245 --> 47:23.070
this Kali Mai, and I will stop her.

47:23.070 --> 47:37.257
Even Putana, who became a very fat person while
sucking the breast by Krishna,

47:37.257 --> 47:46.375
She has come here to divide you, to direct you,
and to take you to this path of sins.

47:46.375 --> 47:54.859
Holika, who was burnt because of her vicious mind,

47:54.859 --> 48:02.969
who tried to kill Prahalad, is again back in this
Kaliyuga which you will find.

48:02.969 --> 48:07.240
As I told you, there is a lady -- if you touch her,
She falls on the ground.

48:07.240 --> 48:11.065
So they asked, “What is it”. They said,
“She is so holy that you cannot touch her”.

48:11.065 --> 48:16.524
If the Ganges river becomes like that,
God save the sinners.

48:16.524 --> 48:19.805
That if you touch somebody,
that person has to fall down.

48:19.805 --> 48:25.255
The other day I met somebody who asked
Me about My opinion about a particular lady.

48:25.255 --> 48:26.509
I did not want to say much.

48:26.509 --> 48:31.244
I said, “Alright, she is there but she is just
talking about bhakti that is in separation”.

48:31.244 --> 48:35.018
Because I did not want to say
anything so directly at that time.

48:35.018 --> 48:41.992
The same gentleman,
whose son got realisation, went to see the lady.

48:41.992 --> 48:49.525
There he found that the disciples didn’t have any
jagruti. They can make out, even you can make out.

48:49.525 --> 48:56.413
So he said that, “How is it, for twenty-five years
you have been with this lady, and you haven't got

48:56.413 --> 49:00.004
been given jagruti?” So
he tried to give them jagruti.

49:00.004 --> 49:06.255
Because they were having the astral on their head,
they got it with a real shake.

49:06.255 --> 49:11.413
Those who get it with a shake, means that.

49:11.413 --> 49:18.414
So they went and told her that, “What is this?
For twenty-five years you have wasted our lives?”.

49:18.414 --> 49:20.779
So she said, “All right.
Call that boy here”.

49:20.779 --> 49:27.421
And the boy was called,
and she just looked into his eyes.

49:27.421 --> 49:31.832
The boy was realised but only up to
the thoughtless awareness, not beyond.

49:31.832 --> 49:37.455
You have to go beyond – into doubtless awareness,
then only you can avoid all these astral troubles completely.

49:37.455 --> 49:42.295
But, with thoughtless awareness also,
you can make it out that there is an astral problem

49:42.295 --> 49:44.179
on us, and we should remove it.

49:44.179 --> 49:49.498
We can remove it.
But we can see that, and we can remove it.

49:49.498 --> 49:52.805
So this boy got that trouble
and he started vomiting.

49:52.805 --> 49:58.646
Naturally, you see, when a person is spiritually
evolved, he cannot tolerate anything negative in him.

49:58.646 --> 50:02.810
He started vomiting out whatever he had.

50:02.810 --> 50:05.500
And when he came home, he was about to die.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.429
Luckily, I came from America.

50:07.429 --> 50:09.937
Immediately I know who was
the person who has done the trick.

50:09.937 --> 50:14.661
Because I knew all of them, one by one.
I know all their tricks.

50:14.661 --> 50:18.436
And I am all alone, still, I am going to save them.

50:18.436 --> 50:20.205
With love.

50:20.205 --> 50:27.750
Because love has the power to engulf all that is
negative like a light has the power to

50:27.750 --> 50:33.764
give up all that is dark.

50:33.764 --> 50:38.863
But the darkness may disappear
into nooks and corners and hide itself.

50:38.863 --> 50:40.809
And again may surface.

50:40.809 --> 50:44.574
So you are there to find it
out wherever there is darkness.

50:44.574 --> 50:51.637
And see to it that they are all destroyed in this
Kaliyuga so that complete Satyuga dawn upon us.

50:51.639 --> 50:58.197
It is now for you, the intelligent
and the elite and the modern,

50:58.199 --> 51:01.781
to see to it for yourself and find out
what I am saying you is true or not.

51:01.781 --> 51:06.028
I can show you with My own experiments and the
experiments they have carried out, which they have

51:06.028 --> 51:13.310
described in the book, which please you
should purchase and see what is written in that.

51:13.310 --> 51:18.476
You come and see those people,
the horrible things they are doing.

51:18.476 --> 51:25.040
Naturally, the one question that can be
asked very intelligently, and I accept it, that:

51:25.040 --> 51:31.382
“You might also be mesmerising people”.
Yes, of course.

51:31.382 --> 51:37.498
“Or you may be yourself an incarnation
of some rakshasi”. Yes, possible.

51:37.498 --> 51:43.680
Now how to explain?

51:43.680 --> 51:49.982
As I have told you, that the libido is
in the sympathetic nervous system.

51:49.982 --> 51:59.972
And with that sympathetic nervous system,
the eyelid gets completely relaxed,

51:59.972 --> 52:07.235
the complete body feels relaxed and
complete being feels absolutely, absolute.

52:07.235 --> 52:15.359
With the parasympathetic, the first thing it helps
is the cancer, because cancer is the outcome of the

52:15.359 --> 52:24.417
sympathetic. But the greatest sign of the
parasympathetic acting on you is that, when you have

52:24.417 --> 52:31.903
closed your eyes, the parasympathetic is excited by
some divine force,  then the eyelids become completely

52:31.903 --> 52:37.987
I mean, the eye's pupil becomes completely dilated black.

52:37.987 --> 52:40.613
My children should have eyes like Mine.

52:40.613 --> 52:46.446
Otherwise, how am I to know,
so many children I have, thousands.

52:46.446 --> 52:53.004
And according to Yoga-Shastras,
the Sahasrara, this portion is Brahmarandra,

52:53.004 --> 52:56.331
the fontanelle bone, here are the Peethas.

52:56.331 --> 53:03.674
Those who get realisation can check their bone here,
and the whole of this portion might also become

53:03.674 --> 53:06.843
soft, like a [inaudible] going around.

53:06.845 --> 53:16.050
At the back also you will find the softness,
sometimes it comes down so much, that sometime it is

53:16.050 --> 53:18.907
difficult to describe.
But there is nothing to describe.

53:18.907 --> 53:21.423
It starts pulsating.

53:21.423 --> 53:24.316
This you cannot do through mesmerism.

53:24.316 --> 53:33.587
This is just this level [inaudible];
inside – I am not telling you.

53:33.587 --> 53:38.468
So, there is another question which was asked.

53:38.468 --> 53:45.567
Of course, they thought it was very
wise and I think it is a great help, that,

53:45.575 --> 53:49.528
“when we put hands to you, we burn.

53:49.528 --> 53:52.540
But when Your disciples put hands to us, they burn.

53:52.540 --> 53:56.270
Now, who is positive and who is the negative”?

53:56.270 --> 54:01.204
It is a complicated question.

54:01.204 --> 54:04.979
So for that,
we have to use a person who is lunatic.

54:04.979 --> 54:09.213
Absolute accepted lunatic or
psychologically affected person.

54:09.213 --> 54:13.480
Ask that person to put the hands to
Me or to My photograph and raise the

54:13.480 --> 54:18.469
Kundalini, he will start shaking so much.

54:18.469 --> 54:22.624
Now, you ask a realised person to put his hands
and go into meditation, while a person who is

54:22.624 --> 54:29.194
suffering from negativity
will start shaking and burning.

54:29.194 --> 54:37.577
The one who is a certified person and a negative
personality, the one who suffers from inferiority

54:37.585 --> 54:55.533
complexes and the fear and all these symptoms
of negativity, should be used as a measuring rod.

54:55.533 --> 55:01.500
One gentleman wanted to take
full advantage of My [inaudible].

55:01.500 --> 55:07.974
He took My photograph and all that and
he also said he was My disciple very openly.

55:07.974 --> 55:12.507
Of course, I accepted that, “You be My
guru if you can give Me something sensible.

55:12.507 --> 55:18.105
And then I got something,
he said you must let me say that I am Your guru.

55:18.105 --> 55:22.188
I said if you want I will tell them,
but I do not think you have done anything unique.

55:22.188 --> 55:25.133
Even now he is [inaudible/paying] for it.

55:25.133 --> 55:30.593
He is telling people he is doing My work.
If so, accepted.

55:30.593 --> 55:40.509
If so, then those people when they come to Me, his
disciples, it is impossible to give them even jagruti?

55:40.509 --> 55:47.777
Anyone of these gurus, if they are doing the work of
Divine, then how is it in Sahaja Yoga, they are

55:47.777 --> 55:54.499
complete failures? While the
innocent children are the first to get it.

55:54.499 --> 56:02.326
If somebody has got jagruti, at this
moment you get a jagruti, it is done by bhoot.

56:02.326 --> 56:07.579
Such gurus spoil the Kundalini to such an extent;
see I have got people of such gurus for three years,

56:07.579 --> 56:17.641
poor things, I feel sorry that the capacity
to grow is lost in their spirits (inaudible).

56:17.641 --> 56:28.647
It breaks My complete being and shatters Me sometimes
the way I see My children have been spoiled.

56:28.647 --> 56:32.066
Their Kundalini has been hit by these thugs.

56:32.066 --> 56:39.196
If they want to earn the money, let them earn.
[Inaudible sentence].

56:39.196 --> 56:45.406
Even if they want to use the name of dharma, let them – after
all, the name of dharma is not going to get spoiled by them.

56:45.406 --> 56:46.868
Doesn’t matter.

56:46.868 --> 56:50.695
But why play with the Kundalini?

56:50.695 --> 56:55.079
And spoil these people permanently.

56:55.079 --> 57:01.388
And make devils out of them for
their next life and next life and next life.

57:01.388 --> 57:05.527
Just for your own publicity, you want to do it.

57:05.527 --> 57:09.713
Because there is no love.

57:09.713 --> 57:16.619
Because you think of the transient
thing that is money and the public.

57:16.619 --> 57:23.070
You have no love for My children,who has been
seeking love for ages and at this juncture when they

57:23.070 --> 57:35.219
came to seek Me, they have taken this poison.

57:35.219 --> 57:50.758
This poison acts, but still, as I told you, that
love is like the bottom of the sea and the complete

57:50.758 --> 58:01.991
effort of sea to become bigger
than the bottom cannot be [inaudible].

58:01.991 --> 58:05.402
That’s why I say no use killing
these people now anymore.

58:05.419 --> 58:06.490
Finished.

58:06.544 --> 58:07.855
They come back.

58:07.879 --> 58:12.417
It’s better to transform them,
and put some life of love.

58:12.417 --> 58:22.243
They talk of love, they talk of religion, they
talk of all the great truths that are written down.

58:22.243 --> 58:33.000
In every religion you will find such people going
around, and earning something out of it for money.

58:33.000 --> 58:39.102
You have to have the other brain
which wants to have the real Self .

58:39.102 --> 58:47.164
I want you to not to believe Me at all; not to have
that blind faith and not to surrender yourself, your

58:47.164 --> 59:00.309
beautiful being to Me who is nothing but
just a person before you get your realisation.

59:00.309 --> 59:03.862
I am just like you before you get your realisation.

59:03.862 --> 59:09.574
When you come to Me, at the most it is like you go
to the temple, put your hands in the bath and

59:09.574 --> 59:11.630
do not get any vibrations.

59:11.630 --> 59:18.597
But once you are realised,
then not only I, but all the temples have a meaning.

59:18.597 --> 59:24.271
All the religions have a meaning.
All these books have a meaning.

59:24.271 --> 59:29.682
That is why, first of all, get the realisation.

59:29.682 --> 59:34.209
With realisation, you not only develop a creative
power because it is love, but also awakening power

59:34.209 --> 59:39.213
and also the realisation power you have to have.

59:39.213 --> 59:44.203
Because I am in the city perhaps, that’s why My
disciples have not been able to give realisation.

59:44.203 --> 59:50.281
But the day I go from Bombay I am sure
they are all going to rise higher and higher.

59:50.281 --> 01:00:00.601
And for a Mother, the greatest pride, the day
she sees Her own children rising in their glory.

01:00:00.601 --> 01:28:24.051
Thank you very much.
