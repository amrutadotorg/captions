00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:08.241
We can throw some light on awareness.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:19.056
As I have told you before – by stopping its search
at a point by saying that we cannot go any further.

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:29.769
In our own being, we have got the negativity
and the positivity as sympathetic and the

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.248
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:50.498
Even in the search of religion, when we start rising
our attention towards this, we start searching it

00:00:50.498 --> 00:01:02.998
outside. This is not because something wrong with
us, but this has come to us through our evolutionary

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:10.748
habits. For example, a fish came out
and became a reptile and started crawling.

00:01:10.748 --> 00:01:16.748
It felt the soil,
the hardness of the soil and started walking.

00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:29.497
In the same way,
every evolutionary jumping has been by going out.

00:01:29.497 --> 00:01:37.248
But now the evolution has to be within,
because the last stage of the complete

00:01:37.248 --> 00:01:43.998
evolving of that instrument is built.

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:56.998
Actually, it is now not the evolution,
but involution that has to take place.

00:01:56.998 --> 00:02:04.748
For example, I take a tape recorder from India
to Singapore and start making it, preparing the

00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:10.997
instrument, and then, I come back on the same.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:21.794
Recording all that has happened to
you within yourself, it is the involution.

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:38.444
With that, the awareness of every manifestation,
which was dead in the beginning, becomes apparent.

00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:46.222
In the human being, when the ray of consciousness
passes through the prism of this brain, it gets

00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:50.830
refracted and we get three types of energies.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.831
Out of that, the sympathetic has got
two; one is the right; another is the left.

00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:03.830
The left side of the sympathetic nervous system of a
man who is right-handed (now I will be only dealing

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:14.081
with the right-handed man),
is the storehouse of the subconscious.

00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:27.331
Or I should say it is the plug through which
we receive the intuition from our subconscious.

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:46.581
The subconscious half is the receiving house of all
that is dead in our thoughts, in our memory, and all

00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:51.153
that is dead in the whole world.

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:59.698
When we die, really we do not
die; most surprisingly, nothing dies.

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:13.655
Only a very little part of our being recedes,
manifested through the element that is Earth, dies.

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:22.155
Otherwise, we remain, in the atmosphere, in the
paralok, as they call it, (in between the hell and

00:04:22.155 --> 00:04:35.819
the heaven, you can say), in the paralok,
where you can see them if you develop those eyes.

00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:39.689
They do exist.

00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:44.188
Now, we are sitting down here, there
is another world where we have to go,

00:04:44.188 --> 00:04:46.463
leaving these clothes here.

00:04:46.463 --> 00:04:54.038
Again, we come back to this world.

00:04:54.038 --> 00:05:02.319
This paralok, or we can say the world of
the dead, exists.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:09.851
The difference is, while we grow here, there they
become smaller and smaller till they reach a stage

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:21.102
where they become a small, minute stick.

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:36.821
They have got the willpower to work
out and manifest their unfinished ideas.

00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:44.170
Supposing, a doctor who has
invented some great medicine and dies.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:56.920
He might manifest on someone after selecting,
and try to do good to people.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:05.170
In London, there is a very great organisation
of Doctor Lang who died long time back.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:12.420
And one day a soldier who was fighting on the
battlefield suddenly felt that somebody had entered

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:22.540
his mind. When somebody is shocked, they can use
that moment to enter the psyche – the psyche which

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.615
is the super-conscious.

00:06:28.615 --> 00:06:38.365
When he entered the body, he told the man that, “you
should go and see my son who is in London and you

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:46.615
tell him that I will work in your body as a medium”.

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:53.319
So he went and told the son,
the son could not believe it.

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:59.244
So, he told him many secret things
which the son did not know and also the

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:02.226
things that nobody knew, but the son.

00:07:02.226 --> 00:07:08.371
This convinced the son and he started
a very big organisation of Doctor Lang.

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:15.871
I have met many people who
have been cured also by their help.

00:07:15.871 --> 00:07:23.078
Now, when one doctor connects your self to that
paralok; (for example, if I have a connection with

00:07:23.078 --> 00:07:31.750
somebody in Los Angeles, I can connect myself with
other people who are there), you can ask some other

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:37.860
doctors to come and help to cure, to do good.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:45.439
This is what is known as spiritual
healing that we have in our mind.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:54.689
I have a disciple who was doing
this kind of work for many years.

00:07:54.689 --> 00:08:06.699
And, after about sixteen years of her doing, she
started feeling very giddy, and she came to see Me.

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:12.318
When I asked her to put her hands towards Me,
I found she had become very sick.

00:08:12.318 --> 00:08:16.318
So, I asked her, “what was the matter?

00:08:16.318 --> 00:08:19.318
Are you doing any spiritual healing?”.

00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:27.318
Naturally, the first answer was, “How do you know,
Mataji?” I said, “Forget it.” Then I had to tell her

00:08:27.318 --> 00:08:32.817
very frankly,
“You must get rid of this on your psyche”.

00:08:32.817 --> 00:08:39.317
She is the wisest person I have yet come across
out of all those people who have been working as

00:08:39.317 --> 00:08:45.045
mediums. She said, “Mataji, I just do not want it.

00:08:45.045 --> 00:08:50.204
Please remove all this.
I just want the Supreme, the Param”.

00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:54.648
I said, “if you want it, you will get it”.

00:08:54.648 --> 00:09:01.701
She got it, and she lost her power of spiritual
healing due to which she used to shake her hand.

00:09:01.701 --> 00:09:06.952
And she got the natural curative power
and the awakening power, and she is one

00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:10.577
of the most dearest disciples of Mine.

00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:21.766
And one day she will go very far in her healing,
because of this [NOT CLEAR].

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:29.266
So, we have people who can do good,
and they want to manifest through you.

00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:36.766
But, one must think why Doctor
Lang did not come on his own son?

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:43.266
Because he did not want his
own son to suffer in the long run.

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:49.266
When anyone acts as medium,
he is no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:51.516
You are not independent.

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:59.266
First, you have to be completely independent of all
these astral aspirations on you, and then only you

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:07.516
can feel the beauty, the glory, of your own being.

00:10:07.516 --> 00:10:21.170
A person who is in the shackles cannot be
made the King and requested to take the throne.

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:27.715
In our country, we have had from ages, people
working on the “mohini vidya” (hypnosis) and the

00:10:27.715 --> 00:10:30.241
“paralok vidya” (another world).

00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:35.007
And in America,
I have seen people having witchcraft.

00:10:35.007 --> 00:10:40.716
One thing great about American
people is that they are absolutely honest.

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:44.216
If they are doing witchcraft,
they say we are doing witchcraft.

00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:50.466
They won’t take up another name
and the witch won’t call oneself a Devi.

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:58.216
They won’t do like that.

00:10:58.216 --> 00:11:08.716
Now, this kind of working is,
how it is worked out, is a very lengthy thing.

00:11:08.716 --> 00:11:17.466
But, I can tell you in a short way.

00:11:17.466 --> 00:11:29.706
As I have told you, the libido, which contains all
that is dead in you, all your subconscious mind,

00:11:29.706 --> 00:11:35.537
is connected with your solar plexus directly.

00:11:35.537 --> 00:11:47.602
In the same way, the right-hand side and the
left-hand side, both sympathetic nervous systems,

00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:53.102
are connected with your solar plexus,
the Manipur chakra, directly.

00:11:53.102 --> 00:12:00.732
Any doctor can guarantee that and can say that,
if it is.

00:12:00.732 --> 00:12:07.666
But unluckily,
the parasympathetic is hanging above.

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:21.912
The vagus nerve, which plays the most important part
in carrying the Kundalini into the backbone,

00:12:21.951 --> 00:12:29.417
has a void, between the solar
plexus and the vagus nerve.

00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:36.054
This void has been described in the great systems of
religion, and people have written books after books.

00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:44.136
So, as soon as your attention even goes to religion,
you start growing on to your sympathetic nervous

00:12:44.136 --> 00:12:49.111
system, either to the right or to the left.

00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:57.611
By growing to the right side of the sympathetic
nervous system, of course in the right-handed man,

00:12:57.611 --> 00:13:02.861
you go to the libido.

00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:11.752
Libido is connected from sex point, up to the
“muddha” (medulla oblongata?) that is the place

00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:21.741
below the brain,
which touches your Agyna chakra here.

00:13:21.741 --> 00:13:32.491
So, by doing any effort, you may get into that trap
of getting into the libido – which is a connection

00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:38.240
already existing between you,
with yourself and the Parama.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:55.741
The other side is the sympathetic nervous system
which is waiting for you to act to any emergency.

00:13:55.741 --> 00:14:01.832
If there is any emergency, as I told you yesterday,
if there is an irritation in the hand, it will start

00:14:01.832 --> 00:14:08.062
acting so much so, that it will overact,
and a malignancy can be created.

00:14:08.062 --> 00:14:12.312
See now both the things,
how they are for your destruction.

00:14:12.312 --> 00:14:19.562
Now, when you see people being mesmerised – those
who are honest say that we are mesmerisers and we

00:14:19.562 --> 00:14:24.061
have this hypnotists and all that, very honest
people are there also in this world, everybody is

00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:29.812
not a cheat. So, they tell plainly that we
are the people who are going to hypnotise.

00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:39.073
When they hypnotise, you get suddenly submerged
into your subconscious mind, the conscious mind gets

00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:46.380
submerged into it,
and you become unconscious to the outside world.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:56.350
And there you start acting according to the
demands of the person who is hypnotising you.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.944
Now, why do you do that?

00:14:58.944 --> 00:15:01.944
If he says you start jumping,
you will start jumping.

00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:05.444
If he says you start feeling sick,
you start feeling giddy.

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:14.085
If he says that you start counting one thousand,
from one to one thousand, you will start doing it.

00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:18.196
There was a girl who was very
anxious to go for a thing like that

00:15:18.196 --> 00:15:19.947
and she asked and I said, “Please do not go”.

00:15:19.947 --> 00:15:23.447
She would not listen – she went
there, and the gentleman asked her

00:15:23.447 --> 00:15:25.568
to count from one to one thousand.

00:15:25.568 --> 00:15:30.573
She was a very innocent girl,
and I knew what had happened to her.

00:15:30.573 --> 00:15:39.074
So, I went to see her just after
that and I found that she had fainted.

00:15:39.074 --> 00:15:44.573
This is like, switching off your mind – the
conscious mind, with which you are listening to Me

00:15:44.573 --> 00:15:46.573
is just get switched off.

00:15:46.573 --> 00:15:51.824
You can also go to a subconscious.

00:15:51.824 --> 00:15:57.515
Any movement towards sympathetic
is against parasympathetic nervous

00:15:57.515 --> 00:15:59.765
system and against Kundalini.

00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:06.265
Ida and Pingala are the two sympathetic nervous
systems on which people have been working.

00:16:06.265 --> 00:16:11.015
And that is the reason they have never
been able to get their self-realisation.

00:16:11.015 --> 00:16:17.424
Because for parasympathetic nervous system,
you must fill the Void with Divine Love.

00:16:17.424 --> 00:16:25.335
By mechanical working, you cannot get to God,
is a simple fact you must understand.

00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:28.804
[Inaudible question or comment from a seeker].

00:16:28.817 --> 00:16:34.174
Shri Mataji: I am happy you told Me.

00:16:34.174 --> 00:16:53.710
Now, that we are connected with the libido through
our efforts, when a person starts weeping and crying

00:16:53.710 --> 00:17:03.210
for God, he might see that the garland
from the deity is coming and garland himself.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.452
It’s quite possible.

00:17:04.452 --> 00:17:07.839
There is nothing to be so much surprised.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:13.277
Depends on how much he is
in connection with the paralok.

00:17:13.277 --> 00:17:19.527
There are so many saints who are not realised,
who have died and want to say that there is God.

00:17:19.527 --> 00:17:21.528
They can work it out.

00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:26.607
But if they are realised people they will
never enter into the psyche of those persons.

00:17:26.607 --> 00:17:31.092
They may give them certain indications like that.

00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:37.342
But, they will never enter the psyche, if they are
realised people because they have achieved their

00:17:37.342 --> 00:17:45.278
independence and they respect
the independence of others.

00:17:45.278 --> 00:17:52.095
Now, if you see the sympathetic nervous system, how
it is worked out; you will be surprised, that the

00:17:52.095 --> 00:18:01.095
symptom of the sympathetic nervous system is – you
get more breathing, more pulse rate, more heartbeat

00:18:01.095 --> 00:18:10.095
and constriction of your intestine,
which leads to constipation and things like that.

00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:21.845
So, the mohini vidya, the way they learn it – first
of all, they master the evil geniuses who have died.

00:18:21.845 --> 00:18:31.753
If they come to know of someone who is an evil
genius, such people who want to benefit by their

00:18:31.755 --> 00:18:40.723
evil methods, wait for their death, and go into
the “shmashanas” (funeral grounds) when they die.

00:18:40.723 --> 00:18:49.166
Because the dead – when they die, the body remains,
but the Atma hovers; at least for thirteen days.

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:51.416
It does not take birth immediately.

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:57.166
Some people take even five hundred
years because they are [inaudible].

00:18:57.166 --> 00:19:04.916
So, that spirit which is hovering there is caught up
by these people through their libido and they take

00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:12.666
away some part of that spirit by
removing a part of the dead matter.

00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:15.666
For example, they may take out the skull bone.

00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:22.666
They may even take the ashes of that (the dead),
because when the soul has to be reborn, he has to

00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:25.058
have that complete body.

00:19:25.156 --> 00:19:33.701
For that those ashes are required, and if these
ashes are kept in control by these people, then they

00:19:33.701 --> 00:19:39.487
(evil spirits) will be born with lame hands
or lame legs and there will be a problem.

00:19:39.487 --> 00:19:45.487
So, they go on hovering there and then, they
(evil spirits) surrender themselves and accept their

00:19:45.487 --> 00:19:49.987
domination completely.

00:19:49.987 --> 00:19:55.737
Now, these people come out in the public
and announce that we can show you miracles.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:56.846
They can, why not?

00:19:56.846 --> 00:20:02.429
Because, for us miracles are something foolish.

00:20:02.429 --> 00:20:10.429
For example, a relation of Mine came and
told Me that some sadhuji has given him a ring.

00:20:10.429 --> 00:20:13.179
I laughed at him and said,
“How many rings have you got?”.

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:14.429
He is a very rich man.

00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:15.679
He said, “I have ten diamond rings”.

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:18.179
I said, “He has given you the eleventh ring.

00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:20.429
Did you go to ask for the ring?”.

00:20:20.429 --> 00:20:24.678
He said, “No, no,
I went to ask him for something very Divine”.

00:20:24.678 --> 00:20:26.631
I said, “Then why did you accept this ring?

00:20:26.698 --> 00:20:30.558
You should have thrown out.” You
should have told that I do not want this ring.

00:20:30.558 --> 00:20:33.557
“Why did you accept?”.

00:20:33.557 --> 00:20:38.558
He said, ”All right, now I don’t care for it,
but you do something about it”.

00:20:38.558 --> 00:20:41.808
Now, these are the experiments we have carried out,
you can also come and see.

00:20:41.808 --> 00:20:43.307
It is all open to you.

00:20:43.307 --> 00:20:47.808
It is a laboratory which is open to all of you,
to come and see with open mind.

00:20:47.808 --> 00:20:49.308
Not just to sneer and to laugh at.

00:20:49.308 --> 00:20:55.558
But to see, with understanding,
to do good to the whole humanity.

00:20:55.558 --> 00:20:57.058
So, I told him.

00:20:57.058 --> 00:20:59.558
He said that, “now You give Me realisation”.

00:20:59.558 --> 00:21:00.719
I said, “I cannot”.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.626
He said, “Why?” I said,
“you will have to remove that ring”.

00:21:03.626 --> 00:21:05.125
He said, “I will not”.

00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:06.876
Then, I said, “I cannot give you the realisation”.

00:21:06.876 --> 00:21:11.126
Then when I started; I told him, “Alright,
you put your hands towards Me”.

00:21:11.126 --> 00:21:13.351
And he started shaking.

00:21:13.351 --> 00:21:14.409
He said, “What is this?

00:21:14.409 --> 00:21:15.191
Why am I shaking?”.

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.941
I said, “Now you take out the ring”.

00:21:16.941 --> 00:21:20.650
Immediately shaking stopped.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.629
He said, “Throw this away”.

00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:29.379
I said, “You must know that ring you can buy in
the market, but can you purchase the Divine in the

00:21:29.379 --> 00:21:32.762
market? Why don’t you use your brain?

00:21:35.656 --> 00:21:35.756
You are a very intelligent man.

00:21:35.756 --> 00:21:38.756
What has happened to you?”

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:42.006
All such “miracles” are working.

00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:48.006
The other day, most surprising that it should
happen at such a juncture when I was to speak on the

00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:54.256
subject, that one gentleman, Mr Sharma from Punjab,
came and was asking about Mataji.

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:58.506
And some of My people were there and they said,
“What is the age of Mataji?.

00:21:58.506 --> 00:21:59.756
They said, “She is fifty”.

00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:04.506
“No, but I know of one Mataji who is four years
old and she calls herself something and all the

00:22:04.506 --> 00:22:06.256
[inaudible/cinema] people are after her.

00:22:06.256 --> 00:22:09.005
What about her, where is she?”.They said,
“We do not know”.

00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:11.756
He started making a lot of inquiries about her.

00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:16.006
So they thought he is from CBI (Central
Bureau of Investigation) or what is he doing.

00:22:16.006 --> 00:22:20.756
Then they said, “Now, you come here
tomorrow for meditation and you will meet Mataji”.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:23.506
Somehow or other, I again came back here.

00:22:23.506 --> 00:22:27.756
And he saw Me and said, “No, no, no,
no – this is not the Mataji I am talking about”.

00:22:27.756 --> 00:22:34.506
Then he tells Me, there was one boy, one gentleman
who came to see Me and told him that, “you invest

00:22:34.506 --> 00:22:40.775
one thousand rupees or one thousand
five hundred rupees in this new venture.

00:22:40.775 --> 00:22:42.641
It is an enterprise.

00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:45.641
You please deposit this money with me.

00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:51.384
And I can assure you, I will return you,
double amount of it, within one month’s time”.

00:22:51.384 --> 00:22:56.018
He said, “How?” He said, ”I have a daughter
who is four-year-old and she is doing miracles”.

00:22:56.018 --> 00:23:00.511
He saw with his own eyes that she
is taking out this and that from the air.

00:23:00.511 --> 00:23:07.145
Now the four-year-old child cannot do
anything positive, I mean consciously.

00:23:07.145 --> 00:23:10.629
But, the little child was picking out
this; whatever you ask her, she is doing

00:23:10.631 --> 00:23:13.355
like this and giving out like this.

00:23:13.355 --> 00:23:17.252
So he was wonderstruck, and he gave the
money; immediately forward with the money.

00:23:17.252 --> 00:23:21.209
Now the person has, he told Me that,
“the gentleman had disappeared and when I read

00:23:21.209 --> 00:23:23.709
the name Mataji, I came to inquire”.

00:23:23.709 --> 00:23:26.209
I said, “I do not need any money from you.

00:23:26.209 --> 00:23:28.046
But thank God you are here.

00:23:28.046 --> 00:23:29.765
Tomorrow you come for your meditation.

00:23:29.765 --> 00:23:32.774
Perhaps one thousand five
hundred is not such a great amount.

00:23:32.774 --> 00:23:39.781
If you can get your self-realisation,
you are saved forever”.

00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:47.901
Now, in My search to find out the method how to
impart this awareness of Mine to others, I have been

00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:50.654
to several of these gurus.

00:23:50.654 --> 00:23:57.527
Some of them I will try to describe,
and now you use your brains and see what happens.

00:23:57.527 --> 00:24:05.277
First of all, in My childhood, My father told Me
there is a sadhu/fakir who has come and who is doing

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:08.027
some great miracles.

00:24:08.027 --> 00:24:11.027
So, I went to see the gentleman.

00:24:11.027 --> 00:24:16.027
And what I found; he had a “chimta”
(tongs) in his hands, you know chimta?

00:24:16.027 --> 00:24:19.277
There is no word for that in English, I think.

00:24:19.277 --> 00:24:24.277
So he was using that hard thing to
hit every person who came to him.

00:24:24.277 --> 00:24:27.777
Then I said,
“What sort of a person he is – I just cannot bear.

00:24:27.777 --> 00:24:29.277
It’s impossible”.

00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:36.277
Actually what he was doing was to hit the man,
and put one devil on him, another devil on the other

00:24:36.277 --> 00:24:40.221
person. After some time,
I found people took out their rings, took out their

00:24:40.221 --> 00:24:44.410
everything and surrendered to him.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.910
I immediately put My hands towards him
and found out that he was a negative person.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.205
How do you make out a negative personality?

00:24:52.205 --> 00:24:54.475
That also I am going to tell.

00:24:54.475 --> 00:24:55.975
Very easy.

00:24:55.975 --> 00:24:58.975
I must give you all the tricks.

00:24:58.975 --> 00:25:06.475
Then I went to another person in Haridwar.

00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:16.725
He was doing wonderful
miracles in My father-in-law’s place.

00:25:16.725 --> 00:25:19.725
As soon as he saw Me, he started shivering.

00:25:19.725 --> 00:25:21.975
Absolutely shivering.

00:25:21.975 --> 00:25:23.104
He said, “Mother, Mother”.

00:25:23.104 --> 00:25:26.354
I said, “What are you doing?” He said,
“I want to get rid of it.

00:25:26.354 --> 00:25:27.854
Please save me from all this.

00:25:27.854 --> 00:25:31.853
I am now sick, I am absolutely finished,
please save me from this”.

00:25:31.853 --> 00:25:36.246
I said, “Are you sure you are finished with this?”.

00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:40.717
He said, “Yes”.

00:25:40.717 --> 00:25:46.357
You will be surprised; within five
minutes he got rid of his maladies.

00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:58.357
And he got his realisation later on,
much later; about two years back.

00:25:58.357 --> 00:26:00.353
In the same way, I went to Pune –

00:26:00.353 --> 00:26:01.821
there was one gentleman, a “mantrika”

00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:03.110
(tantric) who came to see Me.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.969
Same time.

00:26:04.969 --> 00:26:10.299
He was staying with one Mr More and he told Me that,
“Mataji, now I am fed up of this.

00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:16.548
I have cured many people. But now my head is
very heavy and please save Me from all this”.

00:26:16.548 --> 00:26:20.175
So I asked him, “Have you decided
to give up all that forever?”

00:26:20.177 --> 00:26:22.813
He said, “Mataji, save me in this life.

00:26:22.891 --> 00:26:26.515
I am not going to use that medium anymore.
Now I can see that separately .

00:26:26.515 --> 00:26:32.302
In the beginning, I did not know that it
was a medium my guru had put on me.

00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:35.802
Now I am seeing it separately,
I can see my guru also sometimes.

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:39.177
But I cannot sleep day and night.
I am having a terrible time.

00:26:39.177 --> 00:26:42.160
I said, “If you are sure,
then you are going to get realisation.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.805
Don’t you worry”

00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:48.617
And he got his realisation within five minutes.

00:26:48.625 --> 00:26:54.717
Surprisingly. Perhaps because he was
really fed up and he was very honest.

00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:58.632
I told him, “You have lost all your
power of seeing things, of telling things”.

00:26:58.632 --> 00:27:00.431
He used to tell the future, he could see things.

00:27:00.431 --> 00:27:06.013
He used to tell them where is your father is gone,
where is your son is lost.

00:27:06.013 --> 00:27:10.557
So he went out and told Mr. More that,
“How is it possible, Mataji is saying

00:27:10.557 --> 00:27:13.496
that She has taken away all my siddhis.
It is not possible.

00:27:13.496 --> 00:27:18.246
Because, I have done this for twenty-five years”.

00:27:18.246 --> 00:27:20.996
He said, “Alright, then you start your mantras”.

00:27:20.996 --> 00:27:25.496
Within five minutes he found
out he had lost all his powers.

00:27:25.496 --> 00:27:31.311
Then More told him, “Don’t you worry.
Now, you have got the Divine quality .

00:27:31.311 --> 00:27:37.561
Be joyous and happy that this Divine is flowing,
and that you are doing it even

00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:40.061
without feeling that you are doing it.

00:27:40.061 --> 00:27:47.311
What a great joy – stand in your own dignity and
independence, and do not depend on this foolish

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:51.811
material things which are going to die”.

00:27:51.811 --> 00:27:57.755
But, the negativity which incarnates as rakshasas
do not have one thing in them that we have –

00:27:57.757 --> 00:28:02.441
that is Love. They have no love for anyone.

00:28:02.441 --> 00:28:05.441
Then in the course of My search,
I went to so many people.

00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:07.021
They said you become my disciple.

00:28:07.023 --> 00:28:09.878
I said, “All right.
I will become your disciple”.

00:28:09.878 --> 00:28:13.254
I went to one gentleman.
He said, “You have to take sanyasa”.

00:28:13.254 --> 00:28:16.005
I said, “that I will not do”.
He said, “Why?”

00:28:16.005 --> 00:28:17.669
I said, “Because I am a sanyasini”.

00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:20.402
He said, “That is true. But still,
You have to take the dress (ochre robes)”.

00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:22.881
I said, “I will not”.
He said, “Why”?.

00:28:22.881 --> 00:28:30.632
I said, “it will hurt My Heart, it will hurt My
family, it will hurt My mother, father, everyone.

00:28:30.632 --> 00:28:34.661
Why do you want Me to
hurt them for nothing at all?”

00:28:34.661 --> 00:28:42.016
So, he immediately started
mesmerising Me with sympathy.

00:28:42.016 --> 00:28:45.786
He said, “But are you happy with your husband?
Is he treating you all right?”.

00:28:45.786 --> 00:28:50.971
I said, “You do not know how he treats Me.”

00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:55.112
Then he started another trick, “Let him cry.
Let him weep. What is he going to do?

00:28:55.112 --> 00:28:58.450
After all, he will cry, weep and he'll be alright.”

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:04.887
I was surprised. That he could not
even see the love I have for My husband,

00:29:04.887 --> 00:29:07.151
and the respect I have for him.

00:29:07.151 --> 00:29:13.325
The way he suggested – I told him, “How dare you
say such things against My husband whom I have known

00:29:13.325 --> 00:29:15.418
for twenty-five years now?

00:29:15.418 --> 00:29:21.353
And you want Me to accept this nonsensical
thing on My body, hurting all My family people.

00:29:21.353 --> 00:29:28.641
You have no love for mankind”.

00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:34.518
There are people who go and threaten their parents
that, “If you do not give us money, we will take to

00:29:34.518 --> 00:29:38.268
sanyas. We will die.
We will become nude”.

00:29:38.268 --> 00:29:46.018
It’s another way of expressing your
shabbiness towards your parents.

00:29:46.018 --> 00:29:51.268
Our younger people if they think by revolting
against their parents and by hurting them and

00:29:51.268 --> 00:29:56.518
troubling them, they are becoming very beautiful –
they should know that that is not the way to do it.

00:29:56.518 --> 00:30:01.518
Those who cannot love their parents
cannot love anybody in this whole world.

00:30:01.518 --> 00:30:06.518
All the blessings of the world
come through your parents only.

00:30:06.518 --> 00:30:12.621
Those who have denied their parents – of course, if
the parents are telling you something wrong,

00:30:12.621 --> 00:30:19.212
I can understand. But, you should not
deliberately go and hurt them all the time.

00:30:19.212 --> 00:30:24.212
We have examples of such children in
this country – this great country of nine;

00:30:24.212 --> 00:30:27.961
where their vibrations are everywhere.

00:30:27.961 --> 00:30:34.237
We have heard of Shravan.

00:30:34.237 --> 00:30:42.215
The complete Vithala’s temple is built
on the devotion of one person, is there.

00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:51.965
These (negative) people teach you to revolt
against all that is beautiful that God has given.

00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:57.647
This is the first way they hit you by telling you
against your parents, against your husband,

00:30:57.696 --> 00:31:04.034
against your wife, they want to break all your shackles.

00:31:04.034 --> 00:31:06.573
This is not the way.

00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:08.994
Religion is based on Love.

00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:10.357
And how do they do it?

00:31:10.357 --> 00:31:15.783
By putting these evil spirits on you.

00:31:15.783 --> 00:31:22.533
By which you bring money for them and
surrender all that you have at their feet.

00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:26.783
And they enjoy the luxuries of life.

00:31:26.783 --> 00:31:29.783
Even they are such foolish people.

00:31:29.783 --> 00:31:42.783
Why don’t they understand that there is
no joy in luxuries and in transitory fame?

00:31:42.783 --> 00:31:48.033
There was another sadhuji who told Me that,
“You were my wife in my last life”.

00:31:48.033 --> 00:31:52.788
I said, “Wonderful.
I do not see that way about you”.

00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:59.539
It’s a very common thing with many sadhus who
handle women – you see, women are simple women.

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:05.539
If somebody tells them against their husbands, they
feel, yes, yes, there is somebody who sympathises.

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:09.038
With a little sympathy,
you can win a woman, poor thing.

00:32:09.038 --> 00:32:12.039
So he tells Me you were my wife in my last life.

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:17.730
I told him, “Sir, last life is dead and gone.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:22.168
If you are asking Me to do something because
you were My husband in My last life,

00:32:22.168 --> 00:32:27.476
what about the present one whom I have married?

00:32:27.476 --> 00:32:34.991
What do you think of this one?”

00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:38.233
This made him very furious, of course.

00:32:38.233 --> 00:32:52.803
I said, “To Me, apart from My husband,
all are My children including you”.

00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:58.934
Then, there are other ways of approaching people.

00:32:58.934 --> 00:33:07.675
It’s by taking advantage of their weak side.

00:33:07.675 --> 00:33:16.425
To mesmerise in such a way that their
subconscious automatically starts dominating them.

00:33:16.425 --> 00:33:20.425
First of all, you ask somebody to breathe heavily.

00:33:20.425 --> 00:33:26.925
As soon as you start breathing heavily, you go
onto the sympathetic trigger; is an automatic thing.

00:33:26.925 --> 00:33:31.925
And then immediately you
mesmerise the person with the devil.

00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:36.175
You give that person a necklace
which has got a devil sitting on that.

00:33:36.175 --> 00:33:43.675
Now this devil goes home with that
gentleman and tells everything that is happening.

00:33:43.675 --> 00:33:49.506
We had a lady in our group – in our own group,

00:33:49.506 --> 00:33:54.332
who was suffering already from astral trouble.

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:57.057
She came to Me.

00:33:57.057 --> 00:34:00.769
In the beginning, you see,
I did not want to start this topic at all.

00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:05.122
Thanks to her, that now I am so open about it.

00:34:05.122 --> 00:34:10.059
She came to Me and she told Me,
“Mataji, I can see your past”.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:17.729
I could find, first time,
that there is a devil sitting on her.

00:34:17.729 --> 00:34:21.394
If not a devil, a saint.
But you are not independent.

00:34:21.394 --> 00:34:27.887
Without realisation,
if you are seeing anything, it is no good.

00:34:27.887 --> 00:34:33.264
First of all such a person ever gets – there are
only two cases within our group who got such a

00:34:33.264 --> 00:34:36.742
horrible “jagruti” (awakening)
shaking and all that.

00:34:36.742 --> 00:34:42.457
Both of them were absolutely intense.

00:34:42.457 --> 00:34:45.814
So she took up the courage into herself.
And when I went away to America,

00:34:45.814 --> 00:34:51.264
she started telling everybody – I am this. I am
an incarnation of this, I am an incarnation of that.

00:34:51.264 --> 00:34:53.526
And what was she telling?

00:34:53.526 --> 00:34:55.801
Where is your son lost?

00:34:55.801 --> 00:34:58.684
Where is your money lost?

00:34:58.684 --> 00:35:03.643
And all the people who have realisation
from Me started losing their vibrations.

00:35:03.643 --> 00:35:06.249
They did not understand why it was happening.

00:35:06.249 --> 00:35:10.819
so, then one of them just thought, “Is she realised?”.

00:35:10.819 --> 00:35:18.216
And when he tried found out she was not realised
but she was giving them past, terrible past.

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:27.352
So he took up the whole thing into his
hands and he told people that, “you must

00:35:27.352 --> 00:35:31.855
see what is the interest of the Divine?

00:35:31.855 --> 00:35:37.728
Is the Divine interested in
telling you what was your father?

00:35:37.728 --> 00:35:40.611
When you had so many
fathers in your previous lives?

00:35:40.611 --> 00:35:47.995
Or where did you lose your money or whether you are
going to get money in the “satta” (card gambling)”?

00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:56.198
Such people are very good at
telling you the number of the horse.

00:35:56.198 --> 00:36:06.221
Not of the future, but they go and find
out from the jockey, through their medium.

00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:11.601
So this lady started doing this.

00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:17.004
And when I came back,
I found most of My disciples had a heavy head.

00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:23.862
I said, “What have you been doing?” And when I saw
the lady, I found out Myself, within Myself, that

00:36:23.862 --> 00:36:32.730
she was very crudely handling the
astral body by beating them up with a stick.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.674
This is not possible for a self-realised person.

00:36:36.674 --> 00:36:43.387
Even to the greatest evil genius, they cannot.

00:36:43.389 --> 00:36:52.939
This, like Krishna they may just kill the body, that
is different, but they can never beat up the person.

00:36:52.949 --> 00:36:59.921
And all these astral bodies took a revenge
on her and they were all settled in her house.

00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:04.526
Now she started telling people what happened
yesterday in your house, what happened day before

00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:08.338
yesterday, who I was in the past and all that.

00:37:08.338 --> 00:37:15.588
It can be to such a limit, that one of our sessions
we had in Daadar, which many people have seen,

00:37:15.588 --> 00:37:21.400
at least one hundred people must have been there, that
one maidservant, who was an ordinary Maharashtrian

00:37:21.413 --> 00:37:27.766
maidservant, had come for My darshan and she started
shaking, and the lady who was near her started shaking.

00:37:27.819 --> 00:37:31.591
So, I just caught hold of her hand
and I asked her, “Why are you here”.

00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:37.341
She changed her tone and started speaking
beautiful Marathi and using Sanskrit words.

00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:39.840
She said, “I am here for Your darshan”.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.375
So, all the people around started asking, “Who is
Mataji, and why have you come for her darshan?”

00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:52.575
You will be surprised she gave a lecture in fifty
shlokas all describing about Me and My past lives.

00:37:52.575 --> 00:37:56.610
I said, “Will you go from this woman or not?”

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.898
She said, “I have come to sing your
praise and to let people know who you are”.

00:37:59.898 --> 00:38:03.581
I said, “You better not worry about
that and you better go away from here”.

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:06.208
This is the truth in which people have seen.

00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:12.055
You will also see this. If you come to Me
regularly, many things like this.

00:38:12.055 --> 00:38:19.341
So when I told her that, “I do not need your help –
you take your rebirth and come back,

00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:23.912
and you take your realisation”,
she accepted.

00:38:23.912 --> 00:38:27.045
Since that day that lady is alright.

00:38:27.047 --> 00:38:31.453
She is perfectly alright.

00:38:31.478 --> 00:38:35.772
My daughter’s ayah once in the night was going.

00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:39.648
So I told her, “Not to go in the night, about 12
o’clock, these days the atmosphere in the Bombay is

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.570
very much spoiled by rakshasas”.

00:38:43.572 --> 00:38:46.085
She didn’t believe Me, she went out and
next day My daughter rang Me up -

00:38:46.085 --> 00:38:51.542
“Mummy, what to do, she is vomiting too much, and she
is feeling terrible, and she is shaking her body”.

00:38:51.542 --> 00:38:56.542
I said, “You ask her to put her hands
towards the sea and call My name”.

00:38:56.542 --> 00:39:00.824
She got all right in five.

00:39:00.824 --> 00:39:06.171
And when she came back she told Me that “There are
two persons who went out of my body and I saw you

00:39:06.171 --> 00:39:15.161
sitting there with a garland and all those things”.

00:39:15.161 --> 00:39:22.324
So many psychological cases which doctors cannot
cure, or most of the incurable diseases

00:39:22.324 --> 00:39:26.860
are because of astral aspirations.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:39.635
And the more you allow these rakshasas to continue
their work in this great city of Mumbadevi,

00:39:39.635 --> 00:39:51.924
of Mahalaxmi, there are more chances of getting
these people let out free to harm your children.

00:39:51.924 --> 00:40:01.686
There is another Babaji who puts people into
trance. He makes the people starve for two weeks.

00:40:01.686 --> 00:40:09.427
Now if there is somebody who is non-vegetarian. He says you
must strictly stick to vegetarian, you must take only to curd.

00:40:09.427 --> 00:40:15.437
Now the person is weak, and suddenly he puts
mesmerism on that, and another devil is put onto

00:40:15.437 --> 00:40:19.246
that, and this person starts shaking
and says I have got the vibrations.

00:40:19.246 --> 00:40:24.930
But in Nasik, one of his disciples was very
courageous and she told Me, “Mataji, though he says

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.374
these are divine, I don’t believe him.

00:40:27.374 --> 00:40:36.101
Because I don’t eat fats, I get a terrible headache,
and there is no place of any joy within myself

00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.434
which Your disciples are enjoying”.

00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:45.268
There is another type who puts the devil through this --

00:40:45.268 --> 00:40:50.447
the ones who put through this Manipur chakra
are of course, much more dangerous.

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:53.664
Because they give you to eat
some ashes; the bhoot goes inside.

00:40:53.664 --> 00:40:56.219
You eat the ashes with difficulty.

00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:03.437
Such people have given burning on the hand, so much
so that they have developed blisters on their hand.

00:41:03.437 --> 00:41:08.017
Our Patanjali [inaudible/Sethi?] who has written
an article on him has himself burnt his hand.

00:41:08.017 --> 00:41:14.330
There are so many who can tell you about this.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:25.338
So the mesmerism, very genuinely granted by
these people, only helps them to accumulate wealth.

00:41:25.338 --> 00:41:29.328
Now this gentleman was in America when I was there.

00:41:29.328 --> 00:41:36.505
So, one day, I just went to see a public garden,
where they were so many of his disciples

00:41:36.513 --> 00:41:39.074
were distributing the handbills and all.

00:41:39.074 --> 00:41:43.486
So, I asked Chandubhai to collect
some of them and I would like to see.

00:41:43.566 --> 00:41:49.313
So, Chandubhai, who is an expert now,
he said, “Mataji, all their Agnya chakras

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.745
are turning in the opposite direction”.

00:41:52.745 --> 00:41:57.758
If there is any lunatic person, if you see any
lunatic person, if you are realised, you will know

00:41:57.758 --> 00:42:04.312
how to know the Agyna chakra’s movement, you
will find, all the lunatics have their Agnya chakras

00:42:04.312 --> 00:42:07.939
turning in the opposite direction.

00:42:07.939 --> 00:42:14.271
Nothing has happened to the Kundalini, but the
chakra is moved on the sympathetic side,

00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:19.850
through which the libido is contacted,
and you are dominated by a bhoot.

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.802
So I took aside one gentleman.

00:42:21.802 --> 00:42:27.421
He said, “No, I am already spoiled by him. He has
given me a thing here which I must have every day”.

00:42:27.421 --> 00:42:38.947
And the fellow was absolutely
nervous and perspiring immediately.

00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:46.765
This gentleman, I believe, later on, collected so
much money in America, poor Americans, I tell you,

00:42:46.765 --> 00:42:53.375
sometimes I feel so sorry because
they are very genuine people.

00:42:53.375 --> 00:43:01.529
He has taken away even the last pie of so many of
people from there and has brought them here like mad

00:43:01.529 --> 00:43:10.329
people, they are washing his clothes, they
are washing his feet, they are doing everything.

00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:17.958
How can a man who is spiritually alert have so
much attention towards his food, his clothes, his

00:43:17.958 --> 00:43:23.582
belongings, his possessions?

00:43:23.582 --> 00:43:28.401
Except for the beauty aspect of the matter,
the rest is all useless.

00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:30.386
Is a headache.

00:43:30.386 --> 00:43:36.517
It is headache to have many things.

00:43:36.517 --> 00:43:41.859
But, you cannot tell the people who are mesmerised.
If you tell them, they just walk off.

00:43:41.859 --> 00:43:45.494
They won’t listen, do nothing, will be deaf.

00:43:45.494 --> 00:43:50.428
It’s a sign of a temperament which
refuses everything that is positive.

00:43:50.428 --> 00:43:55.481
“Oh, hum to kush hain, hum anand mein
hain” – we are very happy, we are in joy.

00:43:55.481 --> 00:44:01.424
There are some gurus who put
you into trance for six-seven hours.

00:44:01.424 --> 00:44:04.038
What is all this nonsense going?

00:44:04.038 --> 00:44:09.661
Is it possible to be only in trance for
seven hours and later on you could be you?

00:44:09.661 --> 00:44:11.148
Your normal self?

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:11.847
No.

00:44:11.847 --> 00:44:14.685
If you are realised, you are realised forever.

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:20.190
For every moment you are realised and that time,
all the time you are meditative.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.234
There is not a single moment when
you are not collectively conscious.

00:44:24.234 --> 00:44:30.368
Supposing one these people if they are travelling
by train, suddenly they find heaviness.

00:44:30.368 --> 00:44:37.976
A person standing in front has got his Kundalini up there.

00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:46.470
We had a nice music party in Bordi ,
where two-three people had come.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:50.816
And when the musicians started singing,
their Kundalini rose up.

00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:54.527
Of course, I was not there for the realisation,
but their Kundalini rose up.

00:44:54.527 --> 00:44:58.778
And it became very heavy because
they had some astral sitting on them.

00:44:58.778 --> 00:45:05.006
And they didn’t know that they started
looking like that and they started shaking.

00:45:05.006 --> 00:45:06.435
And they couldn’t understand.

00:45:06.435 --> 00:45:13.255
It is sometimes so comical.
The way people start acting.

00:45:13.255 --> 00:45:19.585
Because the bhoots and the devils
have no sense of decency in them.

00:45:19.585 --> 00:45:24.693
They even hover around small children.

00:45:24.693 --> 00:45:36.468
They make you so slavish towards them that
you start behaving in the most obnoxious manner.

00:45:36.468 --> 00:45:44.338
Imagine, a good girl from a good family becoming
naked – and her photos being sold in America at a

00:45:44.338 --> 00:45:46.743
very high price.

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:52.064
People say that it is better to see a cabaret
dance for free like this, than to pay so much for a

00:45:52.135 --> 00:45:55.614
cabaret dance in a bar.

00:45:55.614 --> 00:45:59.071
Is it dharma by any chance, you just think it over.

00:45:59.071 --> 00:46:03.870
What has happened to your brains?

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.730
Now these rakshasas,

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.369
if I describe, you will be shocked how they behave.

00:46:09.369 --> 00:46:15.113
And in this Kaliyuga, how can they come,
as Ravana or Mahishasura they came here.

00:46:15.113 --> 00:46:21.405
Ravana was a very powerful preacher
and had a very big library of his own.

00:46:21.407 --> 00:46:31.112
And with his speech he used to mesmerise the people
such a lot that they used to go into horrible states.

00:46:31.126 --> 00:46:34.046
He had that power within.

00:46:34.046 --> 00:46:39.887
And when Sita would not allow him
to come close to her,

00:46:39.887 --> 00:46:44.043
he could not, because of Her holiness and chastity.

00:46:44.043 --> 00:46:47.162
And Her divine powers.

00:46:47.162 --> 00:46:51.373
He used to threaten Her that in My
next life I will come and destroy the

00:46:51.373 --> 00:46:56.339
chastity of every woman of your country.

00:46:56.339 --> 00:47:11.179
All this: Mahishasura when murdered and killed, by
his own deeds, by Mother Kali, has promised all his

00:47:11.179 --> 00:47:15.245
people who were killed that, Let me be
reborn in the Kaliyuga, and I will see

00:47:15.245 --> 00:47:23.070
this Kali Mai, and I will stop her.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:37.257
Even Putana, who became a very fat person while
sucking the breast by Krishna,

00:47:37.257 --> 00:47:46.375
She has come here to divide you, to direct you,
and to take you to this path of sins.

00:47:46.375 --> 00:47:54.859
Holika, who was burnt because of her vicious mind,

00:47:54.859 --> 00:48:02.969
who tried to kill Prahalad, is again back in this
Kaliyuga which you will find.

00:48:02.969 --> 00:48:07.240
As I told you, there is a lady -- if you touch her,
She falls on the ground.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:11.065
So they asked, “What is it”. They said,
“She is so holy that you cannot touch her”.

00:48:11.065 --> 00:48:16.524
If the Ganges river becomes like that,
God save the sinners.

00:48:16.524 --> 00:48:19.805
That if you touch somebody,
that person has to fall down.

00:48:19.805 --> 00:48:25.255
The other day I met somebody who asked
Me about My opinion about a particular lady.

00:48:25.255 --> 00:48:26.509
I did not want to say much.

00:48:26.509 --> 00:48:31.244
I said, “Alright, she is there but she is just
talking about bhakti that is in separation”.

00:48:31.244 --> 00:48:35.018
Because I did not want to say
anything so directly at that time.

00:48:35.018 --> 00:48:41.992
The same gentleman,
whose son got realisation, went to see the lady.

00:48:41.992 --> 00:48:49.525
There he found that the disciples didn’t have any
jagruti. They can make out, even you can make out.

00:48:49.525 --> 00:48:56.413
So he said that, “How is it, for twenty-five years
you have been with this lady, and you haven't got

00:48:56.413 --> 00:49:00.004
been given jagruti?” So
he tried to give them jagruti.

00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:06.255
Because they were having the astral on their head,
they got it with a real shake.

00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:11.413
Those who get it with a shake, means that.

00:49:11.413 --> 00:49:18.414
So they went and told her that, “What is this?
For twenty-five years you have wasted our lives?”.

00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:20.779
So she said, “All right.
Call that boy here”.

00:49:20.779 --> 00:49:27.421
And the boy was called,
and she just looked into his eyes.

00:49:27.421 --> 00:49:31.832
The boy was realised but only up to
the thoughtless awareness, not beyond.

00:49:31.832 --> 00:49:37.455
You have to go beyond – into doubtless awareness,
then only you can avoid all these astral troubles completely.

00:49:37.455 --> 00:49:42.295
But, with thoughtless awareness also,
you can make it out that there is an astral problem

00:49:42.295 --> 00:49:44.179
on us, and we should remove it.

00:49:44.179 --> 00:49:49.498
We can remove it.
But we can see that, and we can remove it.

00:49:49.498 --> 00:49:52.805
So this boy got that trouble
and he started vomiting.

00:49:52.805 --> 00:49:58.646
Naturally, you see, when a person is spiritually
evolved, he cannot tolerate anything negative in him.

00:49:58.646 --> 00:50:02.810
He started vomiting out whatever he had.

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.500
And when he came home, he was about to die.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.429
Luckily, I came from America.

00:50:07.429 --> 00:50:09.937
Immediately I know who was
the person who has done the trick.

00:50:09.937 --> 00:50:14.661
Because I knew all of them, one by one.
I know all their tricks.

00:50:14.661 --> 00:50:18.436
And I am all alone, still, I am going to save them.

00:50:18.436 --> 00:50:20.205
With love.

00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:27.750
Because love has the power to engulf all that is
negative like a light has the power to

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:33.764
give up all that is dark.

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:38.863
But the darkness may disappear
into nooks and corners and hide itself.

00:50:38.863 --> 00:50:40.809
And again may surface.

00:50:40.809 --> 00:50:44.574
So you are there to find it
out wherever there is darkness.

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:51.637
And see to it that they are all destroyed in this
Kaliyuga so that complete Satyuga dawn upon us.

00:50:51.639 --> 00:50:58.197
It is now for you, the intelligent
and the elite and the modern,

00:50:58.199 --> 00:51:01.781
to see to it for yourself and find out
what I am saying you is true or not.

00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:06.028
I can show you with My own experiments and the
experiments they have carried out, which they have

00:51:06.028 --> 00:51:13.310
described in the book, which please you
should purchase and see what is written in that.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:18.476
You come and see those people,
the horrible things they are doing.

00:51:18.476 --> 00:51:25.040
Naturally, the one question that can be
asked very intelligently, and I accept it, that:

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:31.382
“You might also be mesmerising people”.
Yes, of course.

00:51:31.382 --> 00:51:37.498
“Or you may be yourself an incarnation
of some rakshasi”. Yes, possible.

00:51:37.498 --> 00:51:43.680
Now how to explain?

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:49.982
As I have told you, that the libido is
in the sympathetic nervous system.

00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:59.972
And with that sympathetic nervous system,
the eyelid gets completely relaxed,

00:51:59.972 --> 00:52:07.235
the complete body feels relaxed and
complete being feels absolutely, absolute.

00:52:07.235 --> 00:52:15.359
With the parasympathetic, the first thing it helps
is the cancer, because cancer is the outcome of the

00:52:15.359 --> 00:52:24.417
sympathetic. But the greatest sign of the
parasympathetic acting on you is that, when you have

00:52:24.417 --> 00:52:31.903
closed your eyes, the parasympathetic is excited by
some divine force,  then the eyelids become completely

00:52:31.903 --> 00:52:37.987
I mean, the eye's pupil becomes completely dilated black.

00:52:37.987 --> 00:52:40.613
My children should have eyes like Mine.

00:52:40.613 --> 00:52:46.446
Otherwise, how am I to know,
so many children I have, thousands.

00:52:46.446 --> 00:52:53.004
And according to Yoga-Shastras,
the Sahasrara, this portion is Brahmarandra,

00:52:53.004 --> 00:52:56.331
the fontanelle bone, here are the Peethas.

00:52:56.331 --> 00:53:03.674
Those who get realisation can check their bone here,
and the whole of this portion might also become

00:53:03.674 --> 00:53:06.843
soft, like a [inaudible] going around.

00:53:06.845 --> 00:53:16.050
At the back also you will find the softness,
sometimes it comes down so much, that sometime it is

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:18.907
difficult to describe.
But there is nothing to describe.

00:53:18.907 --> 00:53:21.423
It starts pulsating.

00:53:21.423 --> 00:53:24.316
This you cannot do through mesmerism.

00:53:24.316 --> 00:53:33.587
This is just this level [inaudible];
inside – I am not telling you.

00:53:33.587 --> 00:53:38.468
So, there is another question which was asked.

00:53:38.468 --> 00:53:45.567
Of course, they thought it was very
wise and I think it is a great help, that,

00:53:45.575 --> 00:53:49.528
“when we put hands to you, we burn.

00:53:49.528 --> 00:53:52.540
But when Your disciples put hands to us, they burn.

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.270
Now, who is positive and who is the negative”?

00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:01.204
It is a complicated question.

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:04.979
So for that,
we have to use a person who is lunatic.

00:54:04.979 --> 00:54:09.213
Absolute accepted lunatic or
psychologically affected person.

00:54:09.213 --> 00:54:13.480
Ask that person to put the hands to
Me or to My photograph and raise the

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:18.469
Kundalini, he will start shaking so much.

00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:22.624
Now, you ask a realised person to put his hands
and go into meditation, while a person who is

00:54:22.624 --> 00:54:29.194
suffering from negativity
will start shaking and burning.

00:54:29.194 --> 00:54:37.577
The one who is a certified person and a negative
personality, the one who suffers from inferiority

00:54:37.585 --> 00:54:55.533
complexes and the fear and all these symptoms
of negativity, should be used as a measuring rod.

00:54:55.533 --> 00:55:01.500
One gentleman wanted to take
full advantage of My [inaudible].

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:07.974
He took My photograph and all that and
he also said he was My disciple very openly.

00:55:07.974 --> 00:55:12.507
Of course, I accepted that, “You be My
guru if you can give Me something sensible.

00:55:12.507 --> 00:55:18.105
And then I got something,
he said you must let me say that I am Your guru.

00:55:18.105 --> 00:55:22.188
I said if you want I will tell them,
but I do not think you have done anything unique.

00:55:22.188 --> 00:55:25.133
Even now he is [inaudible/paying] for it.

00:55:25.133 --> 00:55:30.593
He is telling people he is doing My work.
If so, accepted.

00:55:30.593 --> 00:55:40.509
If so, then those people when they come to Me, his
disciples, it is impossible to give them even jagruti?

00:55:40.509 --> 00:55:47.777
Anyone of these gurus, if they are doing the work of
Divine, then how is it in Sahaja Yoga, they are

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:54.499
complete failures? While the
innocent children are the first to get it.

00:55:54.499 --> 00:56:02.326
If somebody has got jagruti, at this
moment you get a jagruti, it is done by bhoot.

00:56:02.326 --> 00:56:07.579
Such gurus spoil the Kundalini to such an extent;
see I have got people of such gurus for three years,

00:56:07.579 --> 00:56:17.641
poor things, I feel sorry that the capacity
to grow is lost in their spirits (inaudible).

00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:28.647
It breaks My complete being and shatters Me sometimes
the way I see My children have been spoiled.

00:56:28.647 --> 00:56:32.066
Their Kundalini has been hit by these thugs.

00:56:32.066 --> 00:56:39.196
If they want to earn the money, let them earn.
[Inaudible sentence].

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:45.406
Even if they want to use the name of dharma, let them – after
all, the name of dharma is not going to get spoiled by them.

00:56:45.406 --> 00:56:46.868
Doesn’t matter.

00:56:46.868 --> 00:56:50.695
But why play with the Kundalini?

00:56:50.695 --> 00:56:55.079
And spoil these people permanently.

00:56:55.079 --> 00:57:01.388
And make devils out of them for
their next life and next life and next life.

00:57:01.388 --> 00:57:05.527
Just for your own publicity, you want to do it.

00:57:05.527 --> 00:57:09.713
Because there is no love.

00:57:09.713 --> 00:57:16.619
Because you think of the transient
thing that is money and the public.

00:57:16.619 --> 00:57:23.070
You have no love for My children,who has been
seeking love for ages and at this juncture when they

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:35.219
came to seek Me, they have taken this poison.

00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:50.758
This poison acts, but still, as I told you, that
love is like the bottom of the sea and the complete

00:57:50.758 --> 00:58:01.991
effort of sea to become bigger
than the bottom cannot be [inaudible].

00:58:01.991 --> 00:58:05.402
That’s why I say no use killing
these people now anymore.

00:58:05.419 --> 00:58:06.490
Finished.

00:58:06.544 --> 00:58:07.855
They come back.

00:58:07.879 --> 00:58:12.417
It’s better to transform them,
and put some life of love.

00:58:12.417 --> 00:58:22.243
They talk of love, they talk of religion, they
talk of all the great truths that are written down.

00:58:22.243 --> 00:58:33.000
In every religion you will find such people going
around, and earning something out of it for money.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:39.102
You have to have the other brain
which wants to have the real Self .

00:58:39.102 --> 00:58:47.164
I want you to not to believe Me at all; not to have
that blind faith and not to surrender yourself, your

00:58:47.164 --> 00:59:00.309
beautiful being to Me who is nothing but
just a person before you get your realisation.

00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:03.862
I am just like you before you get your realisation.

00:59:03.862 --> 00:59:09.574
When you come to Me, at the most it is like you go
to the temple, put your hands in the bath and

00:59:09.574 --> 00:59:11.630
do not get any vibrations.

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:18.597
But once you are realised,
then not only I, but all the temples have a meaning.

00:59:18.597 --> 00:59:24.271
All the religions have a meaning.
All these books have a meaning.

00:59:24.271 --> 00:59:29.682
That is why, first of all, get the realisation.

00:59:29.682 --> 00:59:34.209
With realisation, you not only develop a creative
power because it is love, but also awakening power

00:59:34.209 --> 00:59:39.213
and also the realisation power you have to have.

00:59:39.213 --> 00:59:44.203
Because I am in the city perhaps, that’s why My
disciples have not been able to give realisation.

00:59:44.203 --> 00:59:50.281
But the day I go from Bombay I am sure
they are all going to rise higher and higher.

00:59:50.281 --> 01:00:00.601
And for a Mother, the greatest pride, the day
she sees Her own children rising in their glory.

01:00:00.601 --> 01:28:24.051
Thank you very much.
