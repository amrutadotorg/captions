WEBVTT

01:29.458 --> 01:32.166
I’m very joyous today

01:33.041 --> 01:36.000
to see all of you celebrating My Birthday,

01:36.375 --> 01:40.834
as well as having the

01:42.917 --> 01:46.083
national program same day.

01:46.458 --> 01:50.083
It’s a good combination we have, in the month of March.

01:51.542 --> 01:55.625
Is regarded as springtime in India – Madhumas,

01:56.041 --> 01:58.959
that’s what you sing, Madhumas.

02:01.333 --> 02:05.000
And as you know, twenty-first March is the equinox,

02:09.041 --> 02:11.999
so it sort of is a balance,

02:15.083 --> 02:19.917
and also the center of all the

02:21.834 --> 02:24.999
signs you have in the horoscope.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.875
So many centers I had to achieve,

02:29.500 --> 02:35.125
and also I was born on

02:37.417 --> 02:39.542
the Tropic of Cancer

02:39.959 --> 02:45.250
as you are on the Tropic of Capricorn,

02:45.999 --> 02:51.000
and Ayers Rock is on the Tropic of Capricorn,

02:51.291 --> 02:53.583
just in the center.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.875
So many combinations had to be worked out.

03:01.583 --> 03:07.709
So the principle of ascent

03:08.000 --> 03:09.375
is to be in the center,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.333
to be in the balance,

03:11.709 --> 03:13.834
to be in the maryadas of the center.

03:14.083 --> 03:18.083
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.875
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

03:23.166 --> 03:25.875
to the maryadas?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.041
Then we get caught up.

03:31.500 --> 03:35.417
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

03:35.792 --> 03:38.583
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

03:38.999 --> 03:40.875
Say we have the maryadas,

03:41.125 --> 03:46.083
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

03:48.208 --> 03:53.125
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

03:53.500 --> 03:56.542
on all the sides of the void,

03:57.417 --> 04:01.959
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

04:04.250 --> 04:07.458
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

04:08.208 --> 04:13.083
and to keep to the boundaries is difficult

04:13.333 --> 04:14.625
when you have two problems:

04:14.917 --> 04:18.458
one is the ego, another is the superego.

04:19.875 --> 04:23.999
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

04:24.375 --> 04:26.750
Ego is the problem, and it has very,

04:27.041 --> 04:28.500
very subtle implications now,

04:28.792 --> 04:32.750
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

04:33.917 --> 04:36.917
One is a gross,

04:37.333 --> 04:39.500
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

04:39.875 --> 04:43.917
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

04:44.999 --> 04:49.792
That one is the one,

04:51.750 --> 04:55.709
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

04:58.041 --> 05:03.250
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

05:07.500 --> 05:11.083
then he behaves in this manner,

05:11.458 --> 05:14.208
only that he doesn’t know

05:14.500 --> 05:18.709
how to hide his ego in sophistication.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.999
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

05:22.250 --> 05:26.333
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.625
Like in English language we’ll say,

05:29.917 --> 05:33.291
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

05:37.333 --> 05:41.166
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

05:43.291 --> 05:45.000
It’s such a devious thing,

05:45.291 --> 05:47.000
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

05:47.333 --> 05:48.709
that means you have put a chocolate

05:48.959 --> 05:51.333
on top of that, isn’t it?

05:51.667 --> 05:54.083
Such a camouflage, must understand.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.083
See we must face as we are,

05:56.375 --> 05:59.291
we cannot be facing something else.

05:59.709 --> 06:02.208
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

06:02.500 --> 06:06.250
that we avoid facing ourselves.

06:08.375 --> 06:12.542
Today though the day is of celebration

06:12.959 --> 06:14.834
so in all humor we should understand

06:15.125 --> 06:18.083
what this stupid thing called ego is.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.291
In all humor, not in seriousness,

06:20.625 --> 06:23.000
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

06:26.583 --> 06:31.000
Now as I was explaining in the morning

06:31.500 --> 06:34.999
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

06:35.333 --> 06:38.709
I mean even before going to the hall,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.583
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

06:44.083 --> 06:47.000
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.542
I mean all the time it has been there

06:48.834 --> 06:50.750
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.750
It has never vanished.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.083
So this chakra is all the time working,

06:55.375 --> 06:59.625
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.667
So what happens really,

07:02.999 --> 07:04.375
we should see the physical side of it,

07:04.667 --> 07:06.750
it’s very important to understand.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.166
You see from childhood if we are taught

07:10.500 --> 07:13.792
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

07:14.125 --> 07:15.333
you have to achieve something,

07:15.625 --> 07:17.250
some success or this and that,

07:17.542 --> 07:21.125
then the idea of strength is given to you,

07:21.625 --> 07:25.625
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

07:25.999 --> 07:29.250
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

07:29.542 --> 07:31.458
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

07:31.834 --> 07:35.083
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

07:35.417 --> 07:41.250
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

07:42.417 --> 07:47.250
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.542
You can never be successful if you do like that.

07:51.959 --> 07:53.792
So unless and until you are possessed

07:54.125 --> 07:57.208
you can never be obedient.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.083
This is what it is.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.000
Somebody has to possess you,

08:01.333 --> 08:04.500
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

08:04.917 --> 08:06.834
then you can be obedient;

08:07.125 --> 08:09.417
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

08:09.709 --> 08:13.125
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.999
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

08:16.291 --> 08:19.959
everybody wants to have their own way,

08:20.625 --> 08:25.166
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

08:25.542 --> 08:27.667
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

08:27.999 --> 08:30.166
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

08:30.417 --> 08:34.250
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.041
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

08:37.333 --> 08:40.917
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

08:41.291 --> 08:44.000
they become disobedient.

08:44.417 --> 08:47.792
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.667
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

08:51.000 --> 08:54.333
obedience is weakness.

08:55.875 --> 09:02.792
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

09:03.125 --> 09:08.250
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

09:08.583 --> 09:10.959
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

09:11.166 --> 09:12.750
and all those things it does burst,

09:13.041 --> 09:16.417
but it is flexible also.

09:16.667 --> 09:22.542
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

09:22.917 --> 09:28.125
superego, then the superego

09:28.999 --> 09:32.959
can go up to a point, it is also there.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.792
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

09:42.125 --> 09:44.542
drugs just to push it back

09:44.834 --> 09:50.583
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

09:50.959 --> 09:54.750
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

09:55.166 --> 09:57.583
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

09:57.959 --> 10:02.709
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.750
Otherwise ego is too much.

10:07.375 --> 10:11.208
So when somebody says something to you,

10:12.250 --> 10:14.291
instead of facing up to it

10:14.625 --> 10:18.333
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

10:18.709 --> 10:23.083
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

10:23.959 --> 10:28.041
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

10:28.458 --> 10:30.333
Because there’s another place

10:30.667 --> 10:35.291
where this ego can go is when you come round,

10:35.792 --> 10:39.208
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

10:39.542 --> 10:41.834
so when it is suppressed from the other side

10:42.125 --> 10:44.792
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

10:45.125 --> 10:49.583
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

10:50.542 --> 10:54.000
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

10:54.375 --> 10:58.041
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

11:02.125 --> 11:05.250
and that’s how you sulk and think.

11:05.542 --> 11:08.000
Think so you get more ego,

11:08.333 --> 11:13.208
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

11:17.875 --> 11:19.542
Now, the practical way

11:19.875 --> 11:25.625
the central path is established by being in reality.

11:27.792 --> 11:30.250
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

11:30.583 --> 11:33.625
Supposing something has gone wrong,

11:33.999 --> 11:36.333
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

11:36.667 --> 11:38.000
because I’ve done the mistake.

11:38.291 --> 11:39.792
All right, why did I do the mistake?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.999
Because of this, so next time no.”

11:43.583 --> 11:45.333
But very easy, avoid everything,

11:45.709 --> 11:49.667
come to this and enjoy your ego feeling sad.

11:49.999 --> 11:52.333
Is an indulgence.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.667
And others also feel, “Oh, he’s felt

11:54.917 --> 11:58.250
‘I’m sorry I’ve killed you,’ you see.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.458
He feels sorry for it.”

12:01.959 --> 12:04.250
Yes I’ve seen, it is gone so far

12:04.500 --> 12:06.667
in the minds of the Western people

12:06.999 --> 12:10.834
that there are laws which really forgive people

12:11.041 --> 12:13.208
who should never be forgiven.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.250
They also try to forgive people

12:15.542 --> 12:17.458
because of this left nonsensical Vishuddhi

12:17.834 --> 12:20.959
which indulges into the left side,

12:21.208 --> 12:24.083
you feel sympathy for such people,

12:24.542 --> 12:26.750
who should not have been forgiven.

12:27.083 --> 12:30.999
Like there’s one fellow who has murdered so many people,

12:31.250 --> 12:32.999
put them into gas chambers, this thing.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.917
He’s arrested now, he’s a liability now,

12:35.250 --> 12:37.333
big liability as a prisoner kept somewhere

12:37.625 --> 12:39.792
because they had to keep everything very much closed,

12:40.083 --> 12:40.999
and this and that.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.583
So to maintain such a dog there

12:42.875 --> 12:45.000
was very difficult for English people,

12:45.333 --> 12:47.041
but they are maintaining this one prisoner.

12:47.291 --> 12:49.959
I’ve forgotten his name, horrible fellow whosoever it is.

12:50.166 --> 12:52.208
Now he has been there, he’s old, this thing

12:52.542 --> 12:54.500
- let him die there, what is there to have pity?

12:54.792 --> 12:58.417
Just hang him out and finish. He has killed so many people.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.542
No, but how can you do that.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.750
You must keep this doggy there

13:03.000 --> 13:06.125
though he’s consuming the money of all the people,

13:06.500 --> 13:08.875
though he has killed thousands and thousands

13:09.166 --> 13:11.250
and thousands in gas chamber.

13:11.625 --> 13:15.375
He’s been such a horrid fellow there should be no sympathy,

13:15.750 --> 13:19.458
in the Divine Laws he would be finished in no time.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.500
He’s dissipating every day,

13:21.917 --> 13:25.083
but even now I read articles in sympathy with him.

13:25.417 --> 13:29.500
“Now what is he going to do wrong? Why not leave him alone?”

13:31.208 --> 13:33.500
This is how you play in to the hands

13:33.875 --> 13:38.125
of horrible people by your Left Vishuddhi, first of all.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.750
So this Left Vishuddhi is nothing but purely,

13:42.041 --> 13:45.583
purely ego and then you bend your head like that,

13:45.917 --> 13:48.375
you walk like this.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.792
Now with this Left Vishuddhi though you have many,

13:52.083 --> 13:55.208
many physical problems,

13:55.917 --> 13:59.709
but the worst of all will be lunacy.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.000
The other day somebody told Me that

14:02.375 --> 14:06.000
at the age of forty years now in America,

14:06.375 --> 14:09.792
people are suddenly becoming lunatic

14:11.834 --> 14:14.125
and it’s a very big sickness,

14:14.417 --> 14:18.250
just like they have it in

14:18.959 --> 14:21.333
that horrible disease called AIDS,

14:21.709 --> 14:24.792
in that way it is spreading.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.834
Now I must tell you as your Mother, very clearly,

14:28.125 --> 14:34.375
that this is the part this horrible Left Vishuddhi plays.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.333
Do not indulge into it.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.166
If you have an ego, that’s why it’s Left Vishuddhi,

14:41.458 --> 14:42.583
face up to yourself.

14:42.875 --> 14:47.542
Like today Warren’s idea was that he came and told Me that

14:47.834 --> 14:50.333
“In India when we go, we think that

14:50.709 --> 14:54.041
the people whatever we suggest first start with ‘No, no.’ ”

14:54.458 --> 14:56.041
So you see actually that “No, no,”

14:56.417 --> 14:58.208
is because we are brought up a different way,

14:58.625 --> 15:00.333
you see - to face up to it, we are brought up to it.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.208
That’s why Indians are never guilty.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.959
If they are guilty know that they are westernized.

15:07.417 --> 15:08.375
They’re never guilty.

15:08.709 --> 15:12.917
So now at that time when they say, “No” to something,

15:13.542 --> 15:15.917
ninety nine percent, not the people who are in the cities,

15:16.208 --> 15:18.083
they are same style of (?)

15:18.417 --> 15:22.875
because you have blessed them nicely, but in the villages.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.375
You see they tell themselves,

15:24.667 --> 15:25.917
“No, no, how I could have done it?

15:26.166 --> 15:27.667
All right, if I have done it I better correct it.”

15:27.999 --> 15:31.375
“No, no,” it starts with “No, no.”

15:32.458 --> 15:34.291
But a Western person might hear this “No, no”

15:34.625 --> 15:37.750
and he’ll think, “He’s just punching my ego.”

15:38.417 --> 15:41.709
Because still that ego is there to dominate others,

15:42.083 --> 15:46.083
still this ego thinks they are much better organizers,

15:46.792 --> 15:50.000
still this one thinks they are cleaner people than others,

15:50.291 --> 15:52.583
they are higher people than others.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.542
All this ego thinks like that, you see,

15:55.875 --> 16:00.166
and builds you up and you live on top, you see,

16:00.417 --> 16:04.208
like a balloon or a ring that is bloated

16:04.542 --> 16:07.125
you keep on the surface,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.166
and that’s why don’t want the air to get out,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.917
because you know, you'll sink into yourself.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.250
So one lives on that

16:15.667 --> 16:18.250
and you start thinking you know it better,

16:18.583 --> 16:21.999
anybody says anything to you, one feels hurt,

16:22.250 --> 16:23.959
again Left Vishuddhi.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.625
If Mother says anything, again Left Vishuddhi.

16:26.917 --> 16:31.375
So you have all ready made a pouch there being in the West;

16:31.750 --> 16:34.000
we should face as we are.

16:34.375 --> 16:38.083
Now that pouch is there so anything I say,

16:38.375 --> 16:42.834
now even if I’m saying now, you should not feel guilty.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.834
Let’s see, not feel guilty.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.375
Be on your Spirit so you see yourself

16:48.667 --> 16:49.875
and you can clear out.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.750
If you see from your Spirit’s angle you clear out

16:53.000 --> 16:56.333
that which you have been accumulating since long.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.583
Left Vishuddhi is the problem today of the West I tell you.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.625
All these problems are coming from Left Vishuddhi,

17:03.917 --> 17:07.750
but which is not in no way is that they’re subdued,

17:07.999 --> 17:11.083
on the contrary any moment

17:11.999 --> 17:16.166
this Left Vishuddhi can blow in again into the ego.

17:16.542 --> 17:19.166
You see, I’ve seen this in the West very common,

17:19.542 --> 17:21.959
people are walking straight forward everything is all right.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.458
Even in the cities of India we have seen it

17:24.792 --> 17:26.041
- you make them into trustees,

17:26.375 --> 17:27.625
suddenly they jump on the horse.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.458
I said, “From where did they jump in the horse,

17:29.792 --> 17:31.291
from where did this ego come?”

17:31.625 --> 17:32.999
That was all stored up here you see,

17:33.250 --> 17:35.542
as soon as they become trustees the whole thing comes back

17:35.917 --> 17:38.417
and they are sitting like John Gilpin on a horse

17:38.709 --> 17:40.709
going fast and I start looking at them,

17:40.999 --> 17:42.333
where are they going?

17:42.583 --> 17:45.542
They were just there, disappeared,

17:45.999 --> 17:48.792
vanishing tricks.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.667
Just can’t understand why it happens.

17:51.959 --> 17:55.291
But after penetrating into the problems,

17:55.583 --> 17:57.458
because I see just going to the hall

17:57.792 --> 17:59.333
you get the Left Vishuddhi.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.917
But look at the children,

18:01.208 --> 18:03.125
you see from childhood you don’t teach them

18:03.458 --> 18:07.000
all the time say, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

18:08.125 --> 18:09.709
Our Parsees in India

18:10.083 --> 18:12.709
have very much affectation from you, very much.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.041
So in the morning we never want to see a Parsee

18:15.417 --> 18:18.291
because early in the morning he’ll come and start saying,

18:18.542 --> 18:21.999
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” This is inauspicious.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.625
“Maafkaro, Maafkaro,” you see people say,

18:24.834 --> 18:27.999
“Baba, you come in the afternoon, this is not the time,

18:28.291 --> 18:30.417
morning time don’t start with this.”

18:30.792 --> 18:34.125
We don’t say like this, is inauspicious.

18:34.625 --> 18:35.917
You open the door somebody standing,

18:36.166 --> 18:39.792
“Maafkaro,” for what, what have I done?

18:40.208 --> 18:41.959
What have you done that you are saying like this,

18:42.208 --> 18:45.250
all the time in an apologetic mood you see, for what?

18:45.542 --> 18:47.667
You see, you don’t want to see an apologetic face

18:47.917 --> 18:49.041
in the morning time do you?

18:49.291 --> 18:52.041
Something pleasant, nice coming to greet you, here this

18:52.291 --> 18:56.875
“Maafkaro, maafkaro, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

18:58.041 --> 18:59.166
It’s a very common thing

18:59.458 --> 19:00.999
that we don’t want to see a Parsee in the morning,

19:01.250 --> 19:03.000
the reason is this: you see, if you see them in the morning

19:03.291 --> 19:05.583
the whole day you are in a bad state,

19:05.875 --> 19:07.250
you have seen somebody apologetic.

19:07.583 --> 19:11.125
But it is not apology, they are extremely egotistical people.

19:11.417 --> 19:15.709
If you study their character, they’re very egotistical.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.375
So this one has to understand:

19:21.625 --> 19:26.041
that when we start dealing with our ego

19:26.375 --> 19:28.083
we, must directly deal with it.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.625
We are not ego, we are the Spirit. Directly.

19:30.959 --> 19:37.125
“Oh I see. So it was wrong, so it was done by not me,

19:37.417 --> 19:40.333
by this body, now come along, no, no, better be all right.”

19:40.583 --> 19:44.417
You tell yourself, “No, no better be all right.”

19:45.583 --> 19:46.959
That’s how we are going to deal with it,

19:47.208 --> 19:49.834
because you see this is what is frightening Me

19:50.125 --> 19:51.667
is this Left Vishuddhi.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Because when I thought of this disease,

19:54.375 --> 19:56.291
My attention went to Left Vishuddhi.

19:56.667 --> 19:59.125
Imagine people becoming lunatic.

19:59.542 --> 20:02.291
And most of the egotistical people I find

20:02.583 --> 20:04.959
become stupid because of that.

20:05.291 --> 20:09.000
They are stupid, they behave stupidly, they behave stupidly.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.125
And the egotistical people only take to drugs

20:12.458 --> 20:15.834
and to drink so much because they can stand it.

20:16.208 --> 20:19.709
Supposing a person who is very superego,

20:20.041 --> 20:22.333
supposing a man who is possessed takes to drinks,

20:22.542 --> 20:24.291
he’ll die very soon, he won’t live

20:24.583 --> 20:25.792
because he’s thrown more that side.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.375
But the egotistical people can stand, I mean,

20:28.999 --> 20:31.999
a person who is not egotistical, like an Indian

20:32.250 --> 20:35.834
if he takes a vodka he’ll be blown off the shores,

20:36.166 --> 20:39.041
absolutely, nowhere to be found, lost.

20:39.458 --> 20:43.291
Even in lost and found he won’t be there.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.792
But it’s that ego of yours that has resistance

20:50.166 --> 20:53.834
for the superego

20:54.208 --> 20:55.500
and that’s how you manage it.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.041
You see that’s why people can drink,

20:57.333 --> 20:59.999
it has nothing to do with the cold weather or anything

21:00.291 --> 21:02.333
it’s more your ego.

21:02.834 --> 21:05.583
Now when you call also left sided

21:05.834 --> 21:08.083
sometimes you make a big mistake.

21:08.417 --> 21:11.500
You are not.

21:12.208 --> 21:13.667
You live with that myth

21:13.999 --> 21:17.375
because that’s how you can excuse your ego.

21:17.792 --> 21:20.625
Because basically Western people are egotistical.

21:20.959 --> 21:22.041
We must accept this fact.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.750
We are not Western people, we belong to the realm of God,

21:26.083 --> 21:29.333
so don’t feel guilty.

21:29.667 --> 21:32.500
You are no more Western, to Me you are neither Indian,

21:32.834 --> 21:36.959
nor English nor Australians, you are My children.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.750
But some of these things are hanging around,

21:50.999 --> 21:52.875
so you be careful what I am telling you,

21:53.125 --> 21:56.208
this will happen to all of you in a little way but not much.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.375
So be careful, it is outside,

21:58.709 --> 22:02.750
outside the mariadas where you little bit get out, you find.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.709
So those who think also who are left-sided,

22:07.000 --> 22:10.417
are only possessed people, because they’re possessed,

22:10.750 --> 22:12.500
that’s why they become left-sided,

22:12.750 --> 22:14.875
otherwise they’re not, by temperament they’re not,

22:15.166 --> 22:16.458
because there’s no tradition,

22:16.792 --> 22:18.792
there’s no conditioning accepted, nothing,

22:19.041 --> 22:22.667
there has been no conditioning on them of any kind.

22:22.999 --> 22:27.375
So there are hardly to be found any tamasikas in the West,

22:27.959 --> 22:29.667
hardly to be found.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.458
So what do we have are the people

22:31.792 --> 22:34.417
who are egotistical but get possessed.

22:34.709 --> 22:38.375
So these possessions take charge of your ego,

22:38.709 --> 22:39.875
and they work through your ego,

22:40.125 --> 22:43.166
so they are much more dangerous than the ordinary tamasikas.

22:43.542 --> 22:46.792
You see an ordinary tamasikas who even gets possessed,

22:47.125 --> 22:51.166
he dies very soon; otherwise he just, he troubles himself.

22:51.458 --> 22:55.375
He gets body pains, he gets all those troubles himself.

22:57.542 --> 23:01.917
But when a person who is egoistical is also possessed,

23:02.250 --> 23:05.417
then he becomes a troublesome person.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.083
In India if people drink you’ll be surprised

23:08.375 --> 23:11.750
they become very nice people, extremely mild,

23:12.125 --> 23:14.125
very quiet, very good.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.125
I mean some women told Me,

23:16.417 --> 23:19.417
“We want them to drink because they’re better.”

23:20.500 --> 23:23.000
But not here, they become violent, why?

23:23.291 --> 23:25.750
Because there is already the base for the ego

23:26.041 --> 23:29.667
and these fellows who jump in from the left side

23:29.999 --> 23:33.542
or right side whatever it is take over the ego.

23:33.875 --> 23:35.667
And they work through the ego then,

23:35.959 --> 23:39.917
so such people become cruel, assertive.

23:40.208 --> 23:44.792
I mean, all Germans were dealt like that.

23:45.208 --> 23:48.667
They were all possessed by supraconscious bhoots

23:48.959 --> 23:51.041
and they all behaved in this atrocious manner.

23:51.333 --> 23:54.291
Imagine any human being, human being,

23:54.709 --> 23:58.500
killing millions of people with the gas chamber.

23:58.834 --> 23:59.667
Can you think of it?

23:59.959 --> 24:01.875
I mean, you can’t even see

24:02.166 --> 24:03.834
a little chicken being cut in your presence.

24:04.166 --> 24:08.333
How can you see so many people just there,

24:08.667 --> 24:10.000
being gassed before you,

24:10.375 --> 24:12.083
trying to get out of the gas chambers?

24:12.458 --> 24:16.166
And they were all transparent so you could see them.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.083
See the cruelty to which they could go. How?

24:19.375 --> 24:24.750
They were possessed, and possessed by egoistical temperament.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.917
So these bhoots also used their ego and did it.

24:32.625 --> 24:35.792
So we are in the center,

24:37.250 --> 24:40.709
we are the people who have ascended to God’s level;

24:41.000 --> 24:45.709
we have no business to have Left Vishuddhi on any point.

24:46.166 --> 24:49.583
We have no ego. Where is the ego? It’s finished.

24:49.917 --> 24:52.417
Where is the superego? Finished.

24:52.750 --> 24:56.500
So if there is even a lurking thing of that,

24:56.834 --> 24:59.667
you just face up to it. Why do you feel guilty?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.542
For what?

25:01.875 --> 25:04.417
Nonsense?

25:04.834 --> 25:06.583
And that’s how you get rid of it.

25:06.917 --> 25:08.834
Because I have seen with Sahaja Yogis also

25:09.166 --> 25:12.375
suddenly their nose will blow out, their eyes will come out,

25:12.750 --> 25:15.041
suddenly they’ll talk like this and I get a fright.

25:15.291 --> 25:16.667
I said, “What’s the matter? He was a normal person,

25:16.999 --> 25:19.208
why is he talking like this now?”

25:19.542 --> 25:24.583
The reason is that hidden ego suddenly jumps out and shows.

25:24.917 --> 25:26.083
It’s with many Indians also,

25:26.458 --> 25:29.375
those who are city dwellers are horribly egoistical,

25:29.709 --> 25:31.041
you have blessed them, as I told you,

25:31.375 --> 25:33.750
so they also behave in the same manner.

25:35.166 --> 25:38.500
But because there is tradition of keeping in the center

25:38.792 --> 25:41.125
in any country, like China has the same.

25:41.417 --> 25:44.291
I’ve seen, China has the same.

25:44.959 --> 25:46.375
I haven’t seen they ever say,

25:46.709 --> 25:50.417
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”

25:53.583 --> 25:54.959
And they don’t even discuss.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.291
The Russians have been so bad to them.

25:57.709 --> 25:59.667
“It’s all right,” we tell them. We ask them,

25:59.999 --> 26:02.000
“Why did you cut off from the Russians?” “Forget it.”

26:02.375 --> 26:05.000
They never criticize, sit down and criticize,

26:05.375 --> 26:08.458
“They did like this,” or sulk about it or think about, nothing.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.999
Like Indians, now you will be surprised,

26:11.291 --> 26:13.291
we have a law that we are not supposed

26:13.583 --> 26:17.875
to make any films against the English. Can you imagine?

26:18.125 --> 26:21.500
Because they left our country in grace.

26:22.999 --> 26:25.208
Even Shivaji’s pictures are not allowed

26:25.500 --> 26:29.291
because maybe it will show that the Muslims are bad,

26:29.959 --> 26:33.250
to that extent we go.

26:33.709 --> 26:36.500
Because forget it, forget it, forget it,

26:36.875 --> 26:38.792
when you start thinking about that person,

26:39.166 --> 26:44.291
your ego gets hit.

26:44.999 --> 26:47.375
It is an ego which is hurt,

26:47.750 --> 26:51.291
now you can blow this

26:53.625 --> 26:56.750
balloon by two methods, perhaps you know that,

26:57.083 --> 27:01.750
by blowing into it or removing all the air from outside,

27:02.166 --> 27:05.291
or even by hitting.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.667
So the hurt ego is where the outside

27:11.291 --> 27:15.875
is getting vacated and the balloon is increasing,

27:16.917 --> 27:18.875
and the other ego, pumped up ego,

27:19.166 --> 27:22.166
is that when the balloon is filled with that air.

27:22.542 --> 27:23.792
Both things are just the same;

27:24.041 --> 27:24.999
I mean the result is the same

27:25.333 --> 27:28.333
whether you do it this way or that way.

27:28.750 --> 27:32.667
So once you understand the physical manifestation of this,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.917
not only that you develop all these diseases but also

27:36.208 --> 27:39.583
develop a thing called lunacy at a very, very young age,

27:39.959 --> 27:43.542
because you don’t know how to cope with yourself.

27:43.917 --> 27:46.667
So the best way is to, if you have done something,

27:46.959 --> 27:48.166
forgive yourself at that point,

27:48.458 --> 27:50.250
“I forgive myself at this point, all right.

27:50.625 --> 27:54.417
And that this was done because of this - all right,

27:54.709 --> 27:56.208
so I should not have done this.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.792
Never I’m not going to do it again,”

27:59.000 --> 28:01.834
Just say like that, just absolutely neutralize.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.709
Unless and until you neutralize it,

28:03.999 --> 28:07.625
you again store it up there, that’s the point is.

28:08.875 --> 28:14.959
Secondly I have to tell you that the women in the West

28:15.959 --> 28:20.458
have changed their styles, which is very, very dangerous

28:20.792 --> 28:23.750
for their society, because they have also taken

28:24.083 --> 28:26.166
to the egoistical ways of men.

28:26.542 --> 28:29.625
So if men have gone say ten feet

28:30.000 --> 28:31.709
they have run after them again,

28:32.041 --> 28:35.834
about say eight feet and pulled back men

28:36.125 --> 28:38.875
even to go further than them.

28:39.333 --> 28:43.000
Now this is completely crossing your egos,

28:43.417 --> 28:49.125
because women do not have such possibility of egos normally.

28:49.583 --> 28:52.041
So competing men in ego what you did

28:52.417 --> 28:55.333
you have lost your complete mariadas of a woman,

28:55.709 --> 28:57.542
there’s no mariada of a woman.

28:57.917 --> 28:59.959
Man has a mariada of a man;

29:00.333 --> 29:03.750
if a man starts behaving like a woman, he’s not a man.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.792
In the same way, the women, if they start behaving like men,

29:07.083 --> 29:10.875
then they are no more women. They lost their mariadas.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.999
They’re out, so they get possessed.

29:13.333 --> 29:16.000
And that’s why women, when they are egoistical

29:16.417 --> 29:19.250
they become horrid,

29:19.959 --> 29:22.917
their faces become horrid, they look horrid,

29:23.250 --> 29:24.959
their whole behavior is horrid.

29:25.250 --> 29:28.458
They can become dry like bean sticks you see,

29:28.750 --> 29:33.000
and could be so hard as to hit you like an iron rod.

29:33.333 --> 29:36.375
They say, “The lady with the iron rod in her hand.”

29:36.750 --> 29:40.000
All this happens because we have a mariada,

29:40.375 --> 29:42.166
we are the style as we are.

29:42.583 --> 29:44.875
If it’s a rose, it’s a rose.

29:45.250 --> 29:48.208
Be happy that you are a flower of rose.

29:48.542 --> 29:52.417
Now the rose wants to become the thorn,

29:56.500 --> 30:00.166
so we lose all our mariadas.

30:00.667 --> 30:04.375
Today I will be speaking to you before we start this

30:04.750 --> 30:06.875
here when the people are coming before that,

30:07.208 --> 30:10.917
to the ladies and tell them what’s gone wrong with them,

30:11.291 --> 30:15.041
and that is how you must know that the plight

30:15.500 --> 30:19.625
of the West is not by men, but by women.

30:21.291 --> 30:26.125
Women have ruined the society of West, Western society.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.166
Is the Indian women who have kept the society intact.

30:30.542 --> 30:35.542
All My really thanks to their solid behavior towards life.

30:36.792 --> 30:39.333
It is the women of this country

30:39.709 --> 30:43.417
who have ruined all that was so delicate,

30:43.792 --> 30:47.500
emotional, beautiful, love, affection, compassion.

30:47.834 --> 30:51.291
Women are there to give joy

30:51.875 --> 30:56.041
and happiness and emotional security to the whole society.

30:56.417 --> 31:00.709
While they take over, “Do this, give that, do that.”

31:01.166 --> 31:05.000
Even the husbands have become just like servants in the house.

31:05.417 --> 31:07.041
“You haven’t done the cleaning properly,

31:07.458 --> 31:10.667
you haven’t cleaned the kitchen properly.”

31:10.959 --> 31:14.583
I went to England, I was surprised all kitchen

31:15.083 --> 31:17.834
cleaning and all that is so well done in England,

31:18.125 --> 31:20.333
you see you have everything for cleaning this,

31:20.583 --> 31:22.083
cleaning that. I said, “Why it has happened?”

31:22.458 --> 31:24.083
It’s the men, you see, they had to do it

31:24.375 --> 31:28.166
so they found out all the ways and methods.

31:28.667 --> 31:31.500
Have to be sparkling all right, sparkling you want,

31:31.875 --> 31:34.083
I’ll get you such a thing that

31:34.417 --> 31:36.291
if you put in your hand your hand will burn,

31:36.583 --> 31:38.208
all the acids put everywhere,

31:38.583 --> 31:41.750
with a big glove in the hand put it everywhere.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.000
And everything gets all right.

31:44.250 --> 31:47.583
Then the children, you see, suffer,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.417
because that’s the job of a gardener,

31:51.792 --> 31:54.291
beautiful things that are born,

31:54.709 --> 31:56.250
to be looked after with that kindness.

31:56.583 --> 31:59.917
But you over-indulge into your children in the beginning.

32:01.250 --> 32:06.417
A mother is like a gardener, she has to prune also;

32:07.250 --> 32:09.375
she has to cut also,

32:09.834 --> 32:11.041
so the growth is all right.

32:11.375 --> 32:12.333
If you child is spoilt

32:12.667 --> 32:15.917
you’re no good a mother, useless you are.

32:20.542 --> 32:22.959
But you groom your husband not your children,

32:23.375 --> 32:24.375
just the other way round,

32:24.709 --> 32:26.625
because ego is towards your husband all the time grooming.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.959
“Sit here, go there, what’s this?”

32:29.250 --> 32:31.000
Money business, “Give me all the money,

32:31.291 --> 32:33.333
I keep all the money,” everything.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.583
Now one may say that the law is such.

32:35.917 --> 32:38.500
If the law is stupid, the Sahaja Yoginis

32:38.875 --> 32:40.625
should not take to such a law.

32:40.999 --> 32:43.166
That law has ruined you all, I tell you.

32:43.500 --> 32:47.166
Because this is such an important part of life,

32:47.542 --> 32:51.999
it is such an important area of life

32:53.792 --> 32:57.333
that it should not have suffered.

32:57.750 --> 33:01.500
Where affection, love, kindness,

33:02.875 --> 33:05.333
all that is required is missing,

33:05.750 --> 33:09.000
then you become people without any meaning.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.500
Life is aimless. You don’t know what to do,

33:11.875 --> 33:14.583
that’s why the children commit suicide.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.875
And then the love should be such that they should be pruned,

33:20.166 --> 33:21.500
for that you must have wisdom,

33:21.875 --> 33:23.166
which also one does not develop,

33:23.500 --> 33:26.041
because if you run after your Mooladhara Chakra

33:26.375 --> 33:29.500
how can you have wisdom?

33:31.500 --> 33:34.333
Here men have befooled you completely.

33:34.750 --> 33:37.999
Completely they have befooled you, take it from Me.

33:38.959 --> 33:41.792
You must keep your wisdom intact.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.667
And not only that they have befooled you,

33:44.959 --> 33:48.208
but they themselves have stooped down to befool you.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.458
So they have their devious methods,

33:50.792 --> 33:52.999
they are not straightforward.

33:54.250 --> 33:58.000
So, as Sahaja Yogis we are above all these things,

33:58.291 --> 34:00.917
we have reached the state where we are above.

34:01.208 --> 34:02.875
We are here for correcting

34:03.166 --> 34:05.667
all those things that have gone wrong in the society,

34:05.959 --> 34:07.999
because Sahaja Yoga faces towards the society,

34:08.333 --> 34:10.166
not towards yourself only.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.041
So at this stage we have to understand

34:12.375 --> 34:13.375
what we have to do is:

34:13.750 --> 34:16.999
first of all our own understanding should be such.

34:17.333 --> 34:21.709
Even now with all this movement of Sahaja Yoga understanding,

34:22.083 --> 34:24.999
women don’t realize that they have to be like women.

34:25.291 --> 34:30.000
I have seen them, they still, “What’s wrong?” Still go on,

34:31.041 --> 34:35.917
and men don’t understand that they have to be like men,

34:37.375 --> 34:40.583
even after so many (things/years?).

34:42.125 --> 34:44.458
And if they they become really like men,

34:44.834 --> 34:46.792
women will appreciate them.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.792
And if you become really like women,

34:50.125 --> 34:53.625
men will appreciate you.

34:54.041 --> 34:58.083
You see, it’s the opposites that attract each other,

34:58.542 --> 35:01.250
that should be normal.

35:01.625 --> 35:03.375
But we live in abnormal way

35:03.709 --> 35:07.083
that the men are women and the women are men.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.959
What do you do now?

35:10.333 --> 35:13.709
So it is very important

35:14.083 --> 35:15.834
for men to understand now

35:16.125 --> 35:18.250
- because I am going to talk to women later on

35:18.834 --> 35:21.250
- that they should become like men.

35:21.667 --> 35:24.792
They must fix up things, they must take decisions,

35:25.125 --> 35:27.291
they must be the one who must rule.

35:27.667 --> 35:32.583
But that’s outward, actually it’s the source is the woman,

35:32.999 --> 35:35.625
the woman is the potential and man is the kinetic.

35:35.999 --> 35:38.542
For example, there’s a fan moving.

35:38.959 --> 35:43.000
Movement of the fan is the kinetic force you can say,

35:43.417 --> 35:45.999
but the potential force that is within us

35:46.375 --> 35:49.333
is the one which is the electricity,

35:49.542 --> 35:51.750
which is coming from the source.

35:52.041 --> 35:55.583
Which is higher, the fan that moves or the source?

35:55.959 --> 35:58.875
Let the women decide and men understand.

35:59.417 --> 36:02.250
But if that source dries out and wants to become the fan,

36:02.542 --> 36:04.291
no fan will work.

36:04.750 --> 36:07.542
Upside down situation.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.875
If you realize you are the source,

36:11.125 --> 36:14.625
you are the one who is going to give all the shakti to men,

36:14.959 --> 36:17.792
you will stop behaving like men.

36:18.250 --> 36:20.709
It doesn’t mean that you cannot go to work, you cannot do;

36:20.999 --> 36:24.250
but take to work which is more suitable to women.

36:24.583 --> 36:28.041
Like I would not like a woman to have a bus driver’s job

36:28.417 --> 36:32.375
or a truck driver, or wrestler.

36:39.041 --> 36:42.834
No. I’m not telling you; I’m telling from experience.

36:44.917 --> 36:46.417
Once I was traveling,

36:46.792 --> 36:49.458
I was a student at that time, in Lahore, you see,

36:49.750 --> 36:53.000
and I was traveling by train and at some station,

36:53.333 --> 36:56.125
you see, the train stopped in the night

36:56.333 --> 37:00.917
and a lady came and she said, “Open the door for me.”

37:01.250 --> 37:04.333
So I said, “But it’s so crowded, all right I’ll try, I’ll try.”

37:04.625 --> 37:06.583
And she said. “If You don’t open I can break it.”

37:06.792 --> 37:07.667
I said, “How can you?”

37:07.959 --> 37:09.375
She said, “You don’t know who I am?” I said, “Who?”

37:09.667 --> 37:11.125
She said, “I am Ahmida Bhanu.”

37:11.500 --> 37:13.792
I said, ‘Who’s Ahmida Bhanu?” “The wrestler lady.”

37:14.083 --> 37:15.667
“Oh, baba,” I said, “Thank God.”

37:15.999 --> 37:18.250
I said, “If you’re a wrestler lady

37:18.542 --> 37:20.291
why are you coming in the ladies department,

37:20.667 --> 37:23.875
why don’t you go to the men’s?”

37:25.083 --> 37:27.750
And she pushed the door so violently,

37:28.000 --> 37:29.250
she came up and I looked at her, you know I said,

37:29.667 --> 37:32.750
“Wow, what a person!”

37:36.583 --> 37:42.000
And she sat down, you see, with her whole countenance

37:42.375 --> 37:45.834
and everything, her gait and state of sitting,

37:46.083 --> 37:47.166
everything was so manly.

37:47.458 --> 37:48.417
Like that she sat down and said,

37:48.834 --> 37:51.375
“Come along now those who want to say I should not sit here.”

37:51.709 --> 37:54.458
I said, “Nobody wants that now, Madam, you sit comfortably.

37:54.834 --> 37:56.333
But we’ll have to get somebody

37:56.625 --> 37:59.458
from the other compartment to have wrestling.”

37:59.875 --> 38:03.834
And then she was quiet, and she was really,

38:04.166 --> 38:07.333
I saw her all her muscles so overdeveloped

38:07.709 --> 38:10.083
and she was really looking like

38:10.417 --> 38:15.166
I would say a Western cow, we can say.

38:20.208 --> 38:25.333
Like the cows here look like buffalos, not like cows.

38:26.333 --> 38:28.333
Something very funny I cannot forget that,

38:28.667 --> 38:31.333
you see that experience, I was very young and I was really,

38:31.667 --> 38:35.125
I didn’t know, and I felt like laughing but I couldn’t even

38:35.417 --> 38:39.542
laugh at her, she’ll box my (face?).

38:41.542 --> 38:44.542
So this is what it is, that we are ending up there,

38:44.917 --> 38:46.875
must know that, how far are we going.

38:47.250 --> 38:50.667
Are we going to become wrestlers?

38:51.709 --> 38:54.750
So this is what it is,

38:55.250 --> 38:58.375
one has to learn that it has been there for ages,

38:58.583 --> 39:00.041
ages it has been there.

39:00.333 --> 39:05.000
I have seen, I’ve read books, some books, old books;

39:05.291 --> 39:06.542
I’ve seen some films also,

39:06.917 --> 39:09.041
where they’ve shown even in olden times,

39:09.417 --> 39:11.000
the women used to have broom in their hands

39:11.333 --> 39:12.792
hitting their husband sort of thing.

39:13.125 --> 39:15.458
We, too, have some of them blessed in India

39:15.875 --> 39:19.625
but they’re very, very few, very few women like that.

39:20.542 --> 39:24.375
Not a big number but it may increase, God knows, you see,

39:24.750 --> 39:26.083
so keep your fingers crossed,

39:26.542 --> 39:29.542
but I would say that this is what is happening.

39:29.959 --> 39:33.125
So with too much ego of men which goes into Left Vishuddhi

39:33.500 --> 39:36.458
they say, “No, let the women take over, it’s all right,

39:36.834 --> 39:38.792
let them be satisfied. No more of their aggression,

39:39.083 --> 39:40.500
let them have their own.”

39:40.709 --> 39:42.250
So they do what they like,

39:42.625 --> 39:46.500
men are not bothered and they go into their left this thing,

39:46.875 --> 39:49.291
and there’s no enjoyment of marriage or love.

39:49.750 --> 39:52.750
So now we had yesterday the other marriage

39:53.041 --> 39:56.625
for the benefit of your children, for the goodness of them,

39:56.959 --> 40:00.375
all that, take your roles as women and men.

40:00.792 --> 40:02.834
Your roles are as women and men

40:03.125 --> 40:05.125
and you’ll see you’ll enjoy it.

40:05.542 --> 40:08.208
The quarrel should be on that role.

40:08.542 --> 40:10.625
The man wants to do something for you, you should say,

40:10.959 --> 40:13.250
“No, no, no how can you do? That’s too much for me.

40:13.709 --> 40:14.917
Let me do this work.”

40:15.250 --> 40:16.875
As I’ve told you many a times

40:17.208 --> 40:18.917
how My husband when he gets angry

40:19.166 --> 40:22.458
he wants to wash his undershirt, you see to show he’s angry.

40:22.792 --> 40:27.750
Or when he’s very angry, then he will clean the bathroom.

40:33.125 --> 40:36.542
But he does it so badly

40:38.041 --> 40:39.999
that I know that it is he has done.

40:40.250 --> 40:41.792
I feel like laughing but I dare not

40:42.083 --> 40:45.041
because I must keep his spirit on.

40:45.667 --> 40:49.542
And then he starts talking in a very you see,

40:49.917 --> 40:51.333
respectable way to everyone.

40:51.709 --> 40:54.083
“Thou,” he calls everyone ‘thou,’ you see.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.792
“Thou,” he says, “Thou are like that, thou are like that,”

40:57.166 --> 40:59.999
so I know now he is really angry for something.

41:00.333 --> 41:03.458
But he won’t say what he is angry with, you see.

41:03.834 --> 41:06.333
Then we have to find out what is he angry with,

41:06.750 --> 41:10.625
and if so, don’t feel guilty, correct it.

41:11.999 --> 41:14.291
And then he finds - you see there are so many ways

41:14.667 --> 41:16.917
of neutralizing the anger.

41:17.333 --> 41:21.125
The first thing that happens with ego is the anger.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.333
As yesterday you got married,

41:23.750 --> 41:25.875
you must know how to neutralize this

41:26.250 --> 41:28.083
because still ego is there.

41:28.417 --> 41:31.750
Now to find out how to neutralize

41:32.041 --> 41:34.709
the anger of another person is a very beautiful thing

41:34.999 --> 41:36.083
which I’ve never seen your writers handling,

41:36.417 --> 41:38.250
but in India we have many writers

41:38.583 --> 41:40.583
who have handled the situation.

41:40.917 --> 41:42.542
Now you must find out

41:42.959 --> 41:46.375
what are the weak points of your husband, first of all,

41:46.750 --> 41:47.999
and of your wife.

41:48.291 --> 41:50.083
On what point she get upset.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.500
Now the attitude should be we should not upset her,

41:52.750 --> 41:53.959
we should not make her angry,

41:54.250 --> 41:56.583
and another attitude of the wife the same way,

41:56.959 --> 41:58.583
much more for the husband.

41:58.999 --> 42:01.083
So now, what are the soft points

42:01.458 --> 42:05.542
on which he really gets upset? Just study, it’s very simple,

42:06.250 --> 42:07.834
laugh at it, don’t take it seriously

42:08.125 --> 42:09.667
but be careful to avoid that.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.291
Now also find out what makes him happy.

42:13.709 --> 42:16.375
Like if I’m really sometimes - I never get angry,

42:16.667 --> 42:18.458
as you know that, I never get angry,

42:18.834 --> 42:22.375
but if I am showing off My anger just …

42:31.417 --> 42:35.083
So, now how to show that,

42:35.458 --> 42:38.750
how to neutralize an anger of a person?

42:39.125 --> 42:41.166
Say now, supposing I am trying to show,

42:41.458 --> 42:44.291
if you put a child in My lap - finished, anger is gone.

42:44.750 --> 42:47.999
I cannot show anger with a child on My lap, is simple.

42:48.333 --> 42:49.625
So you must find out.

42:49.792 --> 42:53.625
Like My husband, you see, if he’s angry supposing,

42:53.959 --> 42:56.500
I know him then if I tell him that

42:56.834 --> 43:00.208
“What about getting Me a nice sari.”

43:00.583 --> 43:03.583
Ah, finished, then he’s very happy.

43:03.999 --> 43:07.250
Ah, I’ve done him the greatest favor, you see.

43:07.667 --> 43:09.709
Like that, you see, you must find out

43:10.000 --> 43:11.792
what thing pleases your husband,

43:12.125 --> 43:14.458
what thing pleases your wife, and neutralize it.

43:14.834 --> 43:17.041
And, you see, little things like that you must learn.

43:17.375 --> 43:18.750
This is the art of living,

43:19.083 --> 43:21.583
this is the art of living a Sahaja Yogi life.

43:22.041 --> 43:23.166
Is the art of living it,

43:23.542 --> 43:26.959
how with little few things you see how I manage.

43:27.291 --> 43:29.333
Now you must have seen how in My lecture

43:29.667 --> 43:32.500
I say quite serious things, but in your bubbles of laughter

43:32.875 --> 43:34.792
it just settles down in your mind,

43:35.166 --> 43:36.333
that’s how you should do it.

43:36.709 --> 43:38.625
Because humor is one of the greatest things

43:39.000 --> 43:43.625
that puts the thing through, makes the person understand,

43:43.959 --> 43:46.083
and it doesn’t harm anyone.

43:46.417 --> 43:47.999
That’s how things improve,

43:48.250 --> 43:50.834
and when you see that you are settled down in peace,

43:51.125 --> 43:53.166
that’s the first thing a husband and wife must do

43:53.458 --> 43:54.500
is to settle down in peace.

43:54.834 --> 43:58.583
Children feel all right, everyone feels all right

43:58.959 --> 44:01.166
and then gradually let it correct.

44:01.458 --> 44:05.250
You have no responsibility of correcting each other;

44:05.667 --> 44:07.834
but if you have married somebody who is not a Sahaja Yogini,

44:08.083 --> 44:09.166
who is horrid and all that,

44:09.458 --> 44:10.583
then the question is very different.

44:10.917 --> 44:13.000
But both are Sahaja Yogis married before Me,

44:13.291 --> 44:15.250
should be the easiest thing to do.

44:15.583 --> 44:18.291
And protect each other; look after each other.

44:18.583 --> 44:20.667
There should be complete confidence.

44:22.125 --> 44:26.458
And this is - we have in our country, really I must say

44:26.792 --> 44:29.417
our marriage system has something special about it.

44:29.792 --> 44:32.125
What happened, once I went to Singapore you’ll be surprised,

44:32.417 --> 44:34.750
the early times, I was going to America,

44:35.000 --> 44:37.125
and there was one horrible diplomat’s wife,

44:37.500 --> 44:39.458
she came drunk to the program

44:39.917 --> 44:42.250
and she was asked to get out because she was drunk.

44:42.583 --> 44:44.834
So she informed our Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

44:45.083 --> 44:46.667
that “This lady is doing this kind of work

44:46.959 --> 44:48.750
and She should not do this, She’s a diplomat’s wife

44:49.083 --> 44:51.625
and She’s so highly placed” and this and that.”

44:51.959 --> 44:54.125
So Indira Gandhi without understanding anything

44:54.375 --> 44:55.542
told one fellow who was Haksar,

44:55.792 --> 44:57.375
who was her main person that

44:57.709 --> 44:58.999
“You go and tell Mr. Srivastava

44:59.250 --> 45:02.333
that this should not be done and She should be brought back.”

45:02.750 --> 45:04.083
So the minister, you see,

45:04.458 --> 45:06.000
getting a message for Indira Gandhi

45:06.333 --> 45:09.000
means the deathblow has come to the minister that time.

45:09.375 --> 45:11.000
So he sent for My husband.

45:11.375 --> 45:14.125
And he called him and he said that

45:14.458 --> 45:15.834
“We think you wife should be called back

45:16.083 --> 45:17.125
and this is what has happened.”

45:17.458 --> 45:19.375
And he said, “Why? Why do you want to call Her?

45:19.667 --> 45:21.125
She doesn’t drink, She doesn’t smoke,

45:21.500 --> 45:23.583
She doesn’t do anything wrong. She’s the most decent woman,

45:23.917 --> 45:28.083
She’s very dignified and She knows what She’s doing.

45:28.375 --> 45:29.917
She’s doing good work for no money at all.

45:30.208 --> 45:33.208
She’s doing nothing wrong and if you want I’ll resign

45:33.542 --> 45:34.750
but I’ll not call Her.”

45:35.083 --> 45:36.875
And he got a fright of his life,

45:37.291 --> 45:40.667
because if he resigns who’s going to do the job?

45:41.041 --> 45:43.875
So capable. Just said, “I’ll resign.”

45:44.208 --> 45:46.709
And they were all shocked at it you see,

45:47.083 --> 45:50.000
the way he was confident.

45:50.875 --> 45:52.583
And this I came to know through somebody else,

45:52.917 --> 45:54.709
though he himself the minister who was dead,

45:55.000 --> 45:59.834
half dead with the message from the Prime Minister, you see.

46:00.250 --> 46:03.000
And he then sent back, he also got to see within himself,

46:03.333 --> 46:06.000
he said, “I know the lady very well, She’s very dignified,

46:06.375 --> 46:08.583
She’s a very decent lady, She’s very dharmic

46:08.917 --> 46:10.834
we shouldn’t disturb Her.”

46:11.166 --> 46:13.542
While the fellow Haksar who had sent the message

46:13.834 --> 46:14.959
also got a shock, you see,

46:15.291 --> 46:17.250
and pushed back the shock to Indira Gandhi.

46:17.625 --> 46:19.709
Since that she has never,

46:20.000 --> 46:22.125
never tried to interfere with My work.

46:22.458 --> 46:24.375
You’ll be surprised, she’s never tried to interfere.

46:24.750 --> 46:28.041
This is my husband’s confidence in My work and understanding.

46:28.417 --> 46:29.375
That you should have.

46:29.667 --> 46:31.583
You must know your wife and know your husband,

46:31.917 --> 46:33.999
they cannot do such and such thing.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.959
About, same about your children.

46:36.291 --> 46:37.917
You must have full confidence in them.

46:38.166 --> 46:40.667
You must know what they are, what they are up to,

46:40.959 --> 46:42.458
how far they can go.

46:42.792 --> 46:45.834
And then this confidence, an inner understanding

46:46.125 --> 46:49.792
is the one road to peace, love and affection.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.875
Complete confidence into each other,

46:52.208 --> 46:53.125
wherever they may be.

46:53.458 --> 46:55.667
I can say with confidence you send my daughters anywhere

46:55.999 --> 46:57.208
they will never take to adharmic life,

46:57.625 --> 47:01.250
nor my son-in-laws, but my own daughters I can tell you.

47:01.709 --> 47:04.667
They can never think of adharmic life,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.959
whatever you may try.

47:08.250 --> 47:10.417
It should be that confidence within you

47:10.709 --> 47:12.750
about your own children.

47:13.083 --> 47:15.792
Like they were small, very small and the neighbors came

47:16.083 --> 47:20.250
and said that “Your daughters came and were using this,

47:20.667 --> 47:23.667
our garden, for morning ablution.”

47:24.000 --> 47:26.709
I said. “What?” Said, “My children,

47:27.125 --> 47:31.041
even if they can go into your bathroom, you take them.

47:31.583 --> 47:34.333
I give you two thousand rupees just now, right now.

47:34.709 --> 47:37.333
You just ask them to go to your bathroom,

47:37.709 --> 47:39.333
that’s all.”

47:39.667 --> 47:42.333
I know them too well.

47:43.625 --> 47:46.041
If somebody will say, “Your daughter has taken something,”

47:46.417 --> 47:49.625
I know them too well, they can never touch anybody’s things,

47:49.999 --> 47:50.999
I know them too well.

47:51.208 --> 47:53.792
They’ll never take any obligation from anyone like that,

47:54.041 --> 47:55.959
I know them too well.

47:57.417 --> 48:00.417
So that’s what you should know your children too well.

48:00.834 --> 48:02.917
Don’t insult them in the presence of others.

48:03.250 --> 48:05.999
Build up their character and majesty by saying,

48:06.333 --> 48:08.250
“Come along, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

48:08.999 --> 48:11.458
you are great, you’ll be this, that,”

48:11.792 --> 48:13.250
and put them on that path,

48:13.625 --> 48:16.542
keep them there, respect them.

48:16.959 --> 48:19.417
But don’t spoil them. Don’t spoil them.

48:19.709 --> 48:21.041
We normally spoil.

48:21.417 --> 48:24.583
Either we’re over-indulgent or you make them over-indulgent,

48:24.959 --> 48:28.291
both things are wrong, is again ego.

48:29.291 --> 48:33.417
Tell them how to share things, tell them how to share.

48:34.291 --> 48:35.667
And like if they share,

48:35.959 --> 48:37.667
they give it to somebody else you should be happy,

48:37.959 --> 48:39.875
it’s given to others. “Give this to others,

48:40.166 --> 48:41.500
let the others play.”

48:41.750 --> 48:43.333
You see, you show your happiness on that,

48:43.667 --> 48:44.792
you yourself give to others,

48:45.125 --> 48:46.625
then the children learn all these things.

48:46.999 --> 48:50.500
So marriage is a very big bondage for Sahaja Yoga.

48:50.875 --> 48:53.959
Through marriages we are all bound together.

48:54.333 --> 48:57.208
It’s all a society of very happily married people.

48:57.417 --> 49:01.959
Now if somebody is not capable of having a good marriage,

49:02.208 --> 49:04.208
better forget about it, forget it.

49:04.542 --> 49:07.417
See, after all I have seen women of sixty, of My age,

49:07.709 --> 49:09.083
asking for a marriage.

49:09.333 --> 49:12.166
Yes, there are women and men and they’re sixty years,

49:12.500 --> 49:14.083
“Mother, I’m only sixty and I would like to get married.”

49:14.458 --> 49:18.250
I said, “ What?” At sixty I have thousands of children,

49:18.625 --> 49:20.291
how can you say of such a thing?

49:20.625 --> 49:22.875
I mean, you should not be a bride all your life.

49:23.208 --> 49:25.458
You should be a mother and a grandmother.

49:25.792 --> 49:27.458
I think after forty-five

49:27.709 --> 49:31.583
nobody should think of marriage, is nonsense.

49:32.917 --> 49:35.333
It’s nonsense after forty-five, all the,

49:35.750 --> 49:38.000
even the married women should know they are mothers

49:38.375 --> 49:39.709
and they are going to be grandmothers,

49:40.041 --> 49:42.375
they’re all the time brides.

49:42.750 --> 49:45.458
You see that’s why, that’s one of the reasons

49:45.792 --> 49:47.250
why marriages fail.

49:47.583 --> 49:49.375
Because you are not a bride after say,

49:49.667 --> 49:51.291
thirty years of age or thirty-five years of age,

49:51.583 --> 49:53.667
you are a mother, absolute mother you are.

49:53.959 --> 49:55.875
And you are a father, and that’s how you live as father

49:56.125 --> 49:56.959
and mother of the children.

49:57.291 --> 49:58.999
We are called like that in our country.

49:59.333 --> 50:00.750
Till the age of thirty, thirty years,

50:01.083 --> 50:02.959
we are called as the brides like doolai

50:03.291 --> 50:04.250
but once you are grown up

50:04.667 --> 50:06.750
- I’m never called as My name by anyone.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.667
They say “Kalpana’s Mother” or “Sadhana’s Mother.”

50:10.000 --> 50:12.875
Or even My husband is called as Kalpana’s father,

50:13.250 --> 50:15.291
is never called by his name,

50:15.667 --> 50:17.250
because you become a father and a mother,

50:17.583 --> 50:18.542
accept that position.

50:18.917 --> 50:20.625
But no, you want to be brides at that age,

50:20.959 --> 50:25.125
so you want to have all the bed like a bride has,

50:25.458 --> 50:28.041
all the bedroom thing like a bride has,

50:28.375 --> 50:30.959
and the bedroom thing and it doesn’t work out.

50:31.333 --> 50:33.792
Because you are no more a bride,

50:34.083 --> 50:36.542
and then you think, “Oh, this man has become insipid,”

50:36.875 --> 50:37.959
“This woman has become insipid,”

50:38.375 --> 50:40.709
then you go to another woman, another man, goes on.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.458
Then you go to children

50:42.750 --> 50:44.750
and spoil the innocence of the people.

50:45.083 --> 50:48.917
But if you accept, grow properly, mature like Sahaja Yogis,

50:49.250 --> 50:53.166
as father and mother, as dignified people.

50:55.333 --> 50:58.250
It’s not the source of love only as husbands’

50:58.583 --> 51:00.041
or wives’ relationship,

51:00.375 --> 51:03.083
there are so many relationships, which are a greater source,

51:03.417 --> 51:06.083
but depends on at what point you are.

51:06.458 --> 51:09.375
When you are a small little river, all right;

51:09.750 --> 51:13.542
but now you have become the ocean, so become the ocean.

51:13.917 --> 51:15.500
When you become the sea, become the sea.

51:15.792 --> 51:18.000
When you become the ocean, you become the ocean.

51:18.333 --> 51:20.166
A sea cannot remain like a little,

51:20.583 --> 51:23.999
little small little beginning, can it?

51:24.375 --> 51:26.792
In the same way everyone must know that

51:27.041 --> 51:30.125
they must grow out from this relationship

51:30.458 --> 51:32.750
and should not go on hankering all the time

51:33.125 --> 51:34.583
that husband and wife.

51:34.917 --> 51:36.458
Like forty-five years of age

51:36.834 --> 51:40.333
they are still finding out their husbands, are they mad?

51:40.750 --> 51:45.083
This should stop in our Sahaja Yoga now,

51:45.458 --> 51:48.333
all those who have gone beyond a certain age

51:48.667 --> 51:50.999
should stop bothering Me about marriages,

51:51.291 --> 51:52.250
should become mothers,

51:52.542 --> 51:53.834
there are so many children to be looked after,

51:54.125 --> 51:56.000
we are going to have nurseries, better be there.

51:56.333 --> 51:58.000
What is it, what is the companionship?

51:58.375 --> 52:01.125
The companionship is with children, with the grandchildren,

52:01.542 --> 52:04.083
with great-grandchildren.

52:07.500 --> 52:10.917
This is what one has to understand, men and women both.

52:11.208 --> 52:12.291
Men are just the same.

52:12.709 --> 52:15.250
Men also try never become fathers.

52:15.625 --> 52:16.875
If you are full-fledged fathers,

52:17.208 --> 52:19.875
you don’t have these ideas of marriage, forget it.

52:20.458 --> 52:23.709
If it doesn’t work out with one woman, forget it.

52:24.083 --> 52:28.750
Then forget it. No need, you’ve had enough of it.

52:31.291 --> 52:35.083
So this kind of thing is not necessary at all,

52:35.458 --> 52:36.875
and it has worked in a society

52:37.166 --> 52:38.583
which is not a Sahaja Yogi society,

52:38.917 --> 52:40.458
so it should work in you.

52:40.792 --> 52:43.792
So social ways Indians are quite good,

52:44.083 --> 52:46.333
but they’re bad in economics and politics.

52:46.667 --> 52:49.583
Never follow their politics, horrid.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.458
Horrid.

52:51.792 --> 52:54.542
I mean, I can’t think of a worse politics

52:54.917 --> 52:57.333
that Indian politics, is the worst of all.

52:57.625 --> 52:59.417
If you listen to that,

52:59.709 --> 53:01.208
you will not know whether to cry or laugh,

53:01.542 --> 53:04.917
is such idiots you know, all donkeys have gone into politics,

53:05.166 --> 53:07.417
absolutely donkeys. Worse than that.

53:07.709 --> 53:09.875
They bray like donkeys, they behave like donkeys,

53:10.166 --> 53:11.208
they kick each other,

53:11.625 --> 53:14.917
they do all kind of things can you imagine,

53:15.291 --> 53:16.250
it’s so horrifying.

53:16.667 --> 53:17.959
I mean if you want to have a joke

53:18.250 --> 53:21.291
then you can look at it from a joke point of view,

53:21.709 --> 53:24.375
of the donkeys, you see, behaving like,

53:24.709 --> 53:28.750
absolutely as if they are in charge of our great country.

53:29.125 --> 53:30.792
So most of them are donkeys,

53:31.083 --> 53:33.999
I’ve not come across many who are sensible.

53:34.208 --> 53:36.875
And those who are sensible also want to become donkeys.

53:37.125 --> 53:40.959
What to do? That is their greatest desire is to

53:41.333 --> 53:45.333
- imagine a saint wants to become a donkey!

53:45.750 --> 53:49.250
So let us know that whatever are our good points

53:49.542 --> 53:51.250
are our good points that we should not lose.

53:51.667 --> 53:53.834
Whatever are our bad points we should correct them.

53:54.208 --> 53:57.709
This is a very balanced view towards oneself.

53:58.083 --> 53:59.250
Because we are the gain,

53:59.709 --> 54:02.000
nobody else is going to gain and Sahaja Yogis

54:02.333 --> 54:04.709
have to be selfish about it. We are the gainers;

54:05.000 --> 54:07.500
if we gain, the whole body gains,

54:07.875 --> 54:09.208
whole of Sahaja Yoga gains.

54:09.542 --> 54:12.375
So this is what I am telling you about your social life

54:12.667 --> 54:15.333
which is very important, and about your ego.

54:15.709 --> 54:17.667
But the most important thing is that

54:17.999 --> 54:23.166
once you are in the Sahasara you become My brain,

54:24.250 --> 54:26.333
you become really My brain.

54:26.750 --> 54:28.750
And so you have to be very careful

54:29.125 --> 54:33.667
because you’re not thinking about your family,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.083
your children, your household.

54:36.417 --> 54:38.792
Not thinking about Melbourne ashram

54:39.000 --> 54:41.458
or Sydney ashram or Australia,

54:41.792 --> 54:44.417
but you’re thinking about the whole world

54:44.834 --> 54:48.542
and the whole Universe, and the betterment of it.

54:48.959 --> 54:50.291
When you grow to that state

54:50.625 --> 54:53.208
you become really part and parcel of My brain,

54:53.583 --> 54:58.709
which is concerned with very bigger visions, higher things.

54:59.083 --> 55:01.166
It works on lower levels also,

55:01.542 --> 55:02.875
that’s something good about it,

55:03.166 --> 55:05.875
but it can work on your individual levels.

55:06.166 --> 55:07.917
I pay attention to your individual problems,

55:08.208 --> 55:11.250
to your individual suggestions, to anything that you say,

55:11.583 --> 55:15.208
but the light is for the whole Universe.

55:15.542 --> 55:20.583
So we enter into the realm of universal religion,

55:20.959 --> 55:23.333
which we have to awaken, which we have to work out.

55:23.709 --> 55:25.750
Unless and until you achieve that state,

55:26.166 --> 55:28.834
you will not be called full-fledged Sahaja Yogis.

55:29.208 --> 55:31.500
So, to achieve that you must work hard,

55:31.834 --> 55:33.792
or we can call now you are Sahaja Yogis,

55:34.041 --> 55:35.834
you’ll become maha yogis.

55:36.166 --> 55:39.500
So, we have to achieve that state of maha yoga.

55:39.875 --> 55:42.917
From this to that is very simple, (it) works out.

55:43.250 --> 55:47.083
Imagine four years back I never thought

55:47.458 --> 55:50.917
that I will be able to establish so many of you

55:51.208 --> 55:53.999
here as My children, and it has happened today.

55:54.333 --> 55:57.375
It’s such a great thing that in four years

55:57.750 --> 56:00.458
we have been able to achieve such beautiful results

56:00.792 --> 56:03.250
and next year will be greater still,

56:03.583 --> 56:05.625
I can see from the way people were there.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.999
So, one has to understand in Sahaja Yoga obedience

56:11.500 --> 56:12.917
to what Mother says is all right.

56:13.250 --> 56:15.875
But some people have a bad habit of taking up over,

56:16.208 --> 56:18.792
“for Mother’s sake do it, for Mother.” Who is the person?

56:19.125 --> 56:21.583
Why should anybody say that do it for Mothers sake?

56:21.917 --> 56:23.625
Or Mother says so.

56:23.999 --> 56:27.333
No, when you are the Spirit you understand what Mother says,

56:27.709 --> 56:29.417
so try to understand your Spirit.

56:29.792 --> 56:31.542
That’s the best way you can work it out

56:31.959 --> 56:32.959
and you can be nice.

56:33.333 --> 56:36.500
I want all our children to grow from that height,

56:36.834 --> 56:39.583
let them start with a better standards,

56:39.917 --> 56:43.417
from a better levels, because we started from a lower levels,

56:43.709 --> 56:45.875
we had problems, but let our children start

56:46.083 --> 56:48.792
from a higher level and Melbourne is the place I’ve chosen

56:49.041 --> 56:50.375
for our children to grow.

56:50.750 --> 56:52.875
So I hope women will take their roles,

56:53.166 --> 56:54.333
men will take their roles

56:54.709 --> 56:57.375
and it will be a nice family system built here,

56:57.750 --> 57:02.667
a nice society and this nice society.

57:04.750 --> 57:08.125
What’s it? Put if off.

57:10.917 --> 57:14.125
I know.

57:21.458 --> 57:24.792
I know the lights very well.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.959
I know how they act.

57:29.250 --> 57:31.667
Vishnumaya, that’s Vishnumaya,

57:31.959 --> 57:33.083
we have harnessed the Vishnumaya.

57:33.417 --> 57:37.792
From where did we get light, Vishnumaya, hidden where?

57:38.125 --> 57:41.166
The Vishnumaya, you see, is the One what we need today,

57:41.542 --> 57:43.625
and to understand it in a subtle way

57:43.999 --> 57:45.625
how the Vishnumaya comes.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.500
See now how sahaj, this thing came there

57:48.792 --> 57:49.834
I could speak on Vishnumaya,

57:50.166 --> 57:54.667
because to shift the subject on Vishnumaya is not easy.

57:56.041 --> 57:59.625
See, you must see the play, you must see the play.

57:59.875 --> 58:02.375
Now this Vishmumaya, how does it come?

58:02.750 --> 58:05.291
How it acts through Me so well?

58:05.750 --> 58:07.500
How, what happens, from where does it come?

58:07.875 --> 58:11.625
Hydroelectric, how hydroelectric was, in water,

58:11.959 --> 58:13.291
it is in water in the Guru Tattwa,

58:13.667 --> 58:16.999
but when, when it comes down,

58:17.875 --> 58:20.583
when the Guru Tattwa has come down to you.

58:21.208 --> 58:26.083
On that level the Vishnumaya acts,

58:26.500 --> 58:29.999
that liberates and acts.

58:30.333 --> 58:32.667
For what? For enlightening.

58:34.583 --> 58:37.625
What happens in the gross happens in the subtle.

58:42.542 --> 58:45.291
So One has to take an incarnation,

58:46.166 --> 58:48.542
so the Guru principle has to take an incarnation

58:48.917 --> 58:50.542
to come down to this earth.

58:50.875 --> 58:54.041
So Vishnumaya acts and enlightens people

58:58.500 --> 59:01.834
and this is what it is, and how the whole thing works out.

59:02.083 --> 59:04.083
Now you have seen how I could change the topic

59:04.375 --> 59:08.041
suddenly to that, and you didn’t feel it.

59:08.375 --> 59:11.709
But I just wanted you to see how Mother changes the topics,

59:12.041 --> 59:15.375
because there are some incidents something happens

59:15.834 --> 59:18.542
somewhere, which I know, and it changes.

59:18.875 --> 59:23.208
And it looks like a smooth one subject going on.

59:24.959 --> 59:27.041
Another thing I have to tell you

59:27.458 --> 59:29.875
that all of you must know Sahaja Yoga full well.

59:30.125 --> 59:32.083
Very few people really know about Kundalini,

59:32.417 --> 59:33.750
really know about vibrations.

59:34.041 --> 59:35.333
They do not know where is the Void.

59:35.625 --> 59:36.625
There should be a regular class,

59:36.999 --> 59:38.834
even for grown up Sahaja Yogis.

59:39.125 --> 59:41.166
Where is the Void on the feet,

59:41.583 --> 59:42.834
where are the chakras on the feet?

59:43.083 --> 59:46.750
When I tell them to rub My Feet, they don’t know where it is.

59:47.583 --> 59:50.500
You may be uneducated, doesn’t matter,

59:50.792 --> 59:53.000
but in Sahaja Yoga you should be educated.

59:53.375 --> 59:55.208
You should have a full education in Sahaja Yoga.

59:55.500 --> 01:00:00.542
You must know where is this disease coming from,

01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:04.208
how to cure it. Every one of you should be educated here.

01:00:04.583 --> 01:00:06.291
So when you have your meditation class,

01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:10.000
also you must have a class to educate yourself

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:11.999
about Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.417
what are the things to be done.

01:00:14.792 --> 01:00:16.999
Now there’s a book, of course I saw that’s a good book

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:19.333
they have written about children, but there’s no spontaneity,

01:00:19.667 --> 01:00:20.792
so I’ll have to work it out.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:25.458
But it’s not only the books but My tapes are there.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:27.375
When you are listening to My tapes,

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:30.333
note down the points what Mother has said,

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:31.625
and see for yourself.

01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:34.417
So the education in Sahaja Yoga is very important,

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.250
otherwise your intelligence will rust out.

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:39.834
You must have full education of Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:41.999
only giving Realization is not the work.

01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:45.583
You must have, so others must know you are knowledgeable.

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:49.291
The amount of education you have had nobody had before,

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:51.458
no saint had it.

01:00:51.834 --> 01:00:53.542
So now take full advantage.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:56.834
Whatever your age may be, education qualification maybe,

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:59.375
what doesn’t matter but you should all know

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:02.083
what is Sahaja Yoga, what it means, how it works out.

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:06.166
Ask questions yourself and find answers.

01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:09.333
You all are still students of Sahaja Yoga - must know that,

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:13.458
you are still students of Sahaja Yoga and you must master it,

01:01:13.834 --> 01:01:15.667
you must know it, every word of it.

01:01:15.959 --> 01:01:17.792
Just to enjoy Sahaja Yoga is not the point,

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:19.166
you must also know.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:22.709
Like, if you enjoy a cake cooked by somebody,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.375
you must know how it is cooked,

01:01:24.709 --> 01:01:27.166
because then you can cook for others.

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:29.041
But if you don’t know how to cook

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:31.999
people are not going to believe. This is what I’ve seen.

01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:34.083
Then I’ve seen some Sahaja Yogis

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:36.250
are all the time doing the work,

01:01:36.625 --> 01:01:39.500
they’re active because they’ve been active before,

01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:40.959
but some are lethargic.

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:43.583
You can see even among two Indian people

01:01:43.959 --> 01:01:45.125
you’ll find the same difference,

01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:48.542
though they are here or they may be there, it should not be.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:52.500
Everybody should try to create the same kind

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:55.792
of an enthusiasm and dynamism, not one person.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.458
If one person does it, then it’s no use.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.917
Sometimes such a one person can be very dominating also.

01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:04.208
Everybody should work, the whole body has to work,

01:02:04.542 --> 01:02:05.667
if we can develop that,

01:02:05.999 --> 01:02:11.834
that will help the complete development, upliftment.

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.000
All right?

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:18.875
So today on this day of My Birthday,

01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:21.917
I want to bless you very much,

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:25.458
but every birthday is reducing My age you must know that,

01:02:25.834 --> 01:02:29.500
and so you must grow up now to take over, is important.

01:02:29.917 --> 01:02:31.875
Is very important that you must grow up,

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:33.375
so-called age of Mine,

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.875
though it doesn’t show but it is decreasing,

01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:38.917
you must know that, and so you have to now

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.208
fasten your movements, get to it, work it out.

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:45.125
When others come, talk to them nicely, give them joy,

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:46.999
don’t give them any - give them joy.

01:02:47.291 --> 01:02:48.542
Look after them, be kind to them,

01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:50.291
that is going to be attractive than to,

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.709
immediately somebody says, “You are a bhoot you get out.”

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
When they are in Sahaja Yoga, when they are there,

01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:56.208
I will tell them off.

01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:58.709
There are still, I know some of them still here,

01:02:59.083 --> 01:03:00.208
we have to tell them that,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.166
“You have a problem, you better get out.”

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:04.458
It’s all right, they’ll have to get out of the ashrams

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.417
for a while then come back.

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:09.291
It has to be like that, otherwise they cannot be corrected

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:11.625
and such people must accept gladly that

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:13.542
they should be all right, they must change;

01:03:13.917 --> 01:03:16.291
they must be better than to continue

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.875
with whatever they have because of their ego.

01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:22.000
So try to co-operate with your self

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:24.458
because it wants to be better, and better and better.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:27.000
So all those people whom I’ll be asking,

01:03:27.333 --> 01:03:30.000
I’ll tell Warren, whom those people whom I find

01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:32.041
are not all right should get out of ashram.

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:35.834
Ashram is not a place where all kinds of people should stay.

01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:38.999
Here only the pure up to a point they should be.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.458
There should be certain minimum standard they must have.

01:03:41.792 --> 01:03:43.542
If they do not have that standard, they get out.

01:03:43.875 --> 01:03:46.000
Even if there’s a woman who is dominating,

01:03:46.291 --> 01:03:49.291
or a man who is like a woman, has to get out.

01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:50.999
You have to be normal people,

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.291
otherwise others who come and they see

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:58.709
one man standing like a chicken cut from here, you see.

01:03:59.542 --> 01:04:02.417
They just don’t feel impressed.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:18.917
I tell you, like a miserable Christ you see as I showed you,

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:20.542
standing there limply like that.

01:04:20.834 --> 01:04:23.709
I don’t know who feels impressed by that.

01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:26.625
You must have somebody like you have Christ

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:29.999
in the Sistine Chapel, you see, standing

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:32.625
like a (inaudible) that’s how the men should be,

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:38.000
but dignified, respectable, kindly,

01:04:38.959 --> 01:04:42.000
majestic is all right.

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.917
And the women should be very sweet and nice.

01:04:45.166 --> 01:04:51.250
It pays a very, very long and a great dividend.

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:53.709
Very, very, long,

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:56.291
you don’t know how much it has paid Me.

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:58.792
It is coming so handy today to Me.

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:01.709
You see when I was not doing Sahaja Yoga

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:03.792
by My nature I’ve been kind to people,

01:05:04.041 --> 01:05:06.750
and all that has come.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.208
One example I’ll give you, in London one fellow came,

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:16.083
his name is …that commissioner’s name is what?

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:19.999
Commissioner of Pune, he’s now commissioner of Pune,

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:21.125
all right.

01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:25.750
He came to see us, we had a meeting of My husband’s office

01:05:26.041 --> 01:05:28.208
or something. CP said, “I’ll call them for dinner.”

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.250
I said, “All right.” I had cooked the dinner at home;

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:32.959
there were about twenty-five people who came to dinner.

01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:35.291
They had dinner I must have looked after them,

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:36.834
whatever it is.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.125
So when I went to Pune, Mehrotra,

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.041
told Me that this Commissioner is very anxious

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:43.625
that he should come as the President or the Chairman

01:05:43.917 --> 01:05:46.709
or the reception committee, must receive Me.

01:05:47.041 --> 01:05:49.125
I said, “I don’t remember who is this gentleman.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.875
I remember somebody with the same name.”

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:52.875
He said, “No, no, no, no this is another one.”

01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:56.208
Now this is one of them who had come

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.917
and he praised Me so much, I was amazed how he saw all that.

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:04.000
He said, “This lady whose husband is so highly placed

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:07.834
in life, is so humble, She’s so kind, so motherly.”

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:10.125
And he went home and told his wife,

01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:11.750
“That I’ve never seen such a lady before,

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.917
such a perfect Lady.”

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.542
That’s what I did I don’t know.

01:06:15.917 --> 01:06:19.250
I must have cooked well, of course that I do,

01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:26.667
but I must have looked after him well,

01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:29.417
I must have been kind to him, to all of them.

01:06:29.709 --> 01:06:33.125
I must have not eaten anything Myself,

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:34.834
looked after, must have done something,

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:35.917
I don’t remember what I did.

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:38.083
But by My own nature I have to do,

01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:40.667
and it is not today but I’ve seen so many of them

01:06:40.999 --> 01:06:43.417
come so handy, only because of this nature of Mine,

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.166
only because of this nature of Mine.

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:51.041
You know our High Commissioner in UK,

01:06:51.417 --> 01:06:54.125
both the High Commissioners the first one and the second one,

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:55.709
B.K.Nehru, and the second one,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
they had such tremendous respect for Me, regard for Me,

01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:02.083
can’t imagine,

01:07:02.792 --> 01:07:06.542
because you have to be kind and considerate and nice.

01:07:06.792 --> 01:07:10.083
As you look after Me here, I looked after them.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:13.375
And that’s how they have such impressions,

01:07:13.709 --> 01:07:15.959
I tell you all my husband’s friends and everybody

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:18.500
have such regard and respect.

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:21.125
We went to see somebody who is head of the law,

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:25.250
is the head of the Intelligence in India;

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.458
he gave us a right royal treatment.

01:07:28.834 --> 01:07:30.792
The Collector of Customs was informed that

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:34.291
Mother’s children are coming,

01:07:34.625 --> 01:07:37.999
he himself came to the airport, do you know that?

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:40.250
He was sitting there I don’t know if he came out

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:42.709
to see that you were all out.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.291
It is only My personal life with them

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:47.458
otherwise who cares for whose wife?

01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:49.166
So many came after My husband,

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.333
nobody’s bothered about their wives.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:54.500
Anywhere, you see I came this time

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:56.625
with My husband to go to China

01:07:56.999 --> 01:08:01.792
and his agents who were in Japan and other places,

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:05.000
Honolulu, they all came just to meet Me,

01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:06.999
because he comes nobody comes to see him.

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:11.041
He said, “Now You have come, they’ve come to see.”

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:14.250
Can you believe it?

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:18.250
It’s nothing but just being a lady to them.

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:19.917
It’s such a powerful thing.

01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:23.333
It’s such a powerful thing and women must know how to cook,

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:24.417
that’s important.

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:26.041
If they don’t know how to cook they’re not women,

01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:27.417
I don’t think they’re women.

01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:30.083
They all must know how to cook.

01:08:30.458 --> 01:08:33.792
You must learn how to cook and everybody can learn it,

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:35.000
that’s very important.

01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:38.583
Is the hidden power of a woman lies in how she cooks.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.667
You see our men cannot go anywhere

01:08:40.999 --> 01:08:45.417
because we cook so well they have to come back home.

01:08:45.834 --> 01:08:48.667
They remember the food.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:53.000
So that is the power you have.

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:55.375
Today we are going to have a very short puja

01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:57.291
because today is My Birthday

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:03.417
and so the puja on a birthday should be such that

01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:10.291
it should be more deep, more heartfelt, more joyous,

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:15.917
than it should sort of go on a ritual side.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.583
There’s no need to have much rituals

01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:18.999
because we are in a joyous mood

01:09:19.333 --> 01:09:20.709
celebrating our Mother’s Birthday.

01:09:20.999 --> 01:09:22.208
Already we are there,

01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:24.667
whatever is needed for you to be there

01:09:24.999 --> 01:09:27.625
is not needed now because you are in that joyous mood,

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:28.625
all right?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.166
So only thing a very short puja, I have told him,

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.999
is to be done today is a Birthday.

01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:36.500
There is no need to have a huge big puja,

01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:40.500
all that is needed to bring out all the deities,

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:43.083
they’re already there, up there,

01:09:43.458 --> 01:09:45.750
just see the vibrations they are emitting!

01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:49.834
They’re so very happy that you are celebrating My Birthday.

01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:53.417
So in every puja what we have to do is to awaken them,

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:56.333
ask them to be kind to you, this, that.

01:09:56.667 --> 01:09:58.792
Though they are awakened in Me you want them to be.

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:00.625
But now they’re all awakened in you

01:10:00.917 --> 01:10:02.709
we don’t have to have big puja at all,

01:10:03.041 --> 01:10:04.291
there’s no need at all.

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:07.500
And this is what I’ve told Modi that you have a very,

01:10:07.792 --> 01:10:11.166
very short puja and a very short puja should be all right.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.750
So today’s talk was just like a puja.

01:10:14.083 --> 01:10:16.834
Remember that this is meant for you

01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:18.375
when you were not Sahaja Yogis.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:23.333
Today it is not meant for you. So you won’t feel guilty.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:27.291
First remember you are Sahaja Yogis,

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:29.667
you are My children and I love you very much,

01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:31.125
very, very much.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:33.250
So please have confidence in yourself,

01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:35.917
complete confidence in yourself, all right?

01:10:36.208 --> 01:10:38.208
That’s the greatest thing you can give Me today

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:41.999
as a present. May God bless you!

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:46.500
Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.

01:10:56.959 --> 01:11:00.709
So for this you have to have washing of My Feet

01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:02.542
for ten - five minutes

01:11:02.999 --> 01:11:06.208
and washing of My Hands for about ten minutes,

01:11:06.542 --> 01:11:07.917
that’s all, as simple as that.

01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:09.959
Now we don’t need many people for that,

01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:12.583
just put that thing here.
