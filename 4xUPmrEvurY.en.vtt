00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:12.770
Now for puja, one has to understand that without
Realisation, puja has no meaning, because

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.680
you are not ananya.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:26.610
Is, you have to become aware of your whole.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.340
Krishna’s description of Bhakti is ananya.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:42.780
He says, “I will give you ananya bhakti”,
He wants ananya bhakti, means when there is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
not the other, means when we are realised.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.370
Otherwise He says “Pushpam, phalam toyum”
(Bhagavad Gita verse 26) “A flower, a fruit

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:04.600
and a water: whatever you give me I accept”
But when it comes to giving, He says, “You

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.280
have to come to Me with ananya bhakti,”
means: when you have become

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.210
one with Me, then you should have the devotion,
not before that.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.640
Before that, you are not connected.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.439
Now puja is the left hand side projection.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.250
It’s the neutralisation of the right side,
very much.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.020
Specially for people who are very right handed,
atmosphere which is very right handed, puja

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.969
is ideal for them.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:51.840
Is the bhakti, is the devotion…that you
project.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:08.530
Now what happens actually when you project
this puja?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.800
It has been found out, and now as I am telling
you, that first you have to awaken within

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.630
you the Deities that are still asleep, by
worshipping them.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:31.640
But as these Deities, Primordial Deities,
are with Me, you worship Me, and every Deity

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.590
in Me is awakened, by which your Deities are
awakened.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.070
So first, your vibrations must improve, to
receive.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:49.290
If the reception is not good what’s the
use of any puja or projection?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.630
So first of all we, sort of, prepare our instrument,
or prepare our projecting instrument.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:07.010
That preparation is done by praying to different
Deities, as we call that: a Kundalini puja.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.390
By praying to My Kundalini you improve your
reflection.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:22.230
Because then the vibrations from Me start
flowing into yours and they awaken it.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:31.680
This is the projection as far as you are concerned.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.570
Once the instrument is alright, then you project
outside.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.500
And now how do you project?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:58.490
By worshipping the Goddess as the Protector
of the whole Universe, praising Her different

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:08.850
attributes, even Her Face, Her Hands, everything
has a meaning.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.960
Praising Her Powers.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:22.500
By saying that, by repeating that, you echo
in your projection Her Powers, and then your

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.540
projection becomes that powerful.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:33.290
It’s a very subtle happening that takes
place, it’s miraculous.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.850
These things look so simple, like just like
washing my Feet.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.100
Simple thing is washing my Feet.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.600
Now see these Feet, I don’t know if you
see, the whole Universe I see there and I

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.530
really get stunned by them.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.140
When you wash My Feet, what do you do?

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.490
Actually, My Feet have been working very hard.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.630
And then you put a little water to soothe
them, to suggest that you can feel the effort

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.870
put in by these Feet.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:20.990
And a kind of a very sweet, melodious love
flows out of these Feet there.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.060
Like today I was coming, and I suddenly saw
Paul (Winter) standing.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.080
Same thing happened to me.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.110
See, what a care it is, what an understanding,
“Mother is coming, She should not be lost!”

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.120
Just that, and the thing started melting.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:49.080
Because this love who understands everything,
doesn’t want anything, but is only excited

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.960
if there is somebody to receive the love.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.620
Now how do you say you are going to receive?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.610
By expressing these small-small things.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:09.460
So when you soothe My Feet, wash Them, clean
Them, you know what They mean: you recognise.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.919
That recognition, how are you to show?

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.889
You see, these ceremonies, little ceremonies
are important because they express your recognition.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:25.810
It could be absolutely dull, dead and finished,
and it could be absolutely living, if you

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.120
know why you are doing it.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:37.560
Then you apply some oil and things [to] again
soothe My Feet.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.970
Just say, “Mother, You have worked very
hard, Your Feet have worked very hard."

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.670
Just saying that itself, I mean makes no difference
otherwise, if you say in a very rational manner,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:56.840
but to that Love that are these Feet it makes
a very big difference.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.520
There is sweetness: a little thing, a little
baby just puts her hand on her mother’s

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.949
cheeks, you see, just to express the gratitude,
and the mother’s heart starts jumping with

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:12.949
love.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:23.790
It is a very reciprocal behaviour, it’s
very subtle and that kind of a subtle working

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:33.270
is fixed already: it works that way only.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.930
The more you love from your heart, the more
the joy will be there.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:45.220
The more you are rational and more mental,
there won’t be so much joy.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:51.330
It should be [that] first of all your cleansing
is important but the projection should be

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:58.240
towards your Mother, that is the height.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:10.130
Once you achieve that height, then you become
all-powerful, and then you can give to others.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:21.150
But that giving is nothing but is a very,
very, as I told you is a very mutual and absolutely

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.150
reciprocal.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.830
Because the Devi knows about you, everything.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:32.460
If you are trying anything else, She knows
and She will also tell you frankly that this

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:37.289
should not be done, that should not be done,
should not be done, clearly, so that you do

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.579
not be under any misunderstandings about it.

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:46.149
But still, to work it out, you must know it
has to be reciprocal, it cannot be one-sided.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:58.699
The sincerity cannot be one-sided, it has
to be both sides, then it works out better.

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:10.850
And a kind of a homogeneous feeling with that
Love comes in, sort of a lubricant, a beautiful

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:17.610
feeling of movement within yourself comes
in.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:23.009
Puja really is the triggering thing, it triggers
you.

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:30.160
It triggers you into another realm, it’s
really miraculous.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.430
Once you have done the puja then you can project
out, much more, in your silence only.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:39.620
Your silence itself becomes so powerful.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:49.199
Now in this special case of our Western lives,
we have to established our innocence, very

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:55.220
important, it is the first thing that is attacked,
innocence is attacked by so many things.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.269
So we have to established our innocence.

00:09:59.269 --> 00:10:04.740
And innocence is the most powerful thing:
it doesn’t see anything bad, it doesn’t

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.069
see anything wrong, it doesn’t see anything…It
loves, just goes on loving, innocence.

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.740
A child doesn’t know that the mother hates
the child.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.059
The child doesn’t know if anybody hates.

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:19.819
In innocence they live.

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:26.110
And then they suddenly discover sometimes,
they are shocked, how people are!

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.920
They don’t love!

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.730
They don’t love.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.570
So Ganesha is very important for the Western
countries, very important, because that’s

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:46.110
the essence of everything, I think, that’s
the most essential thing.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.790
That’s why we worship Ganesha first.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:59.069
And Ganesha was created first of all, because
He is the eldest son, He’s the first son.

00:10:59.069 --> 00:11:15.310
He’s the eldest brother you have, and though
Kumara (Kartikeya) is treated as an elder

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:24.589
brother always, while Ganesha calls Himself
as a younger brother, though He was the first

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:27.279
created!

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:29.839
Because He remains young always, never grows.

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:35.420
So in a way, He’s always younger to you
also.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:42.319
It’s a very, very subtle understanding:
a very young little thing is so much wiser.

00:11:42.319 --> 00:11:43.319
He is wisdom.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:46.470
Can you imagine a little baby is so intelligent.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.350
A little baby so wise?

00:11:49.350 --> 00:12:01.410
Much more, He’s like a grown-up little baby,
a very matured, wise, little baby.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:13.639
So by age, you are always older than Him,
but by wisdom, He is the eldest.

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:20.379
Then like this you should understand how we
evoke all the Deities within us by doing these

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:23.279
small things, by saying Their mantras.

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:28.589
Because now you are awakened, every word you
say is awakened now, is siddha mantra.

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:37.519
On this Guru puja I’m really going to give
you the way of how to do the siddhartha is

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:49.509
the establishment of the siddha.

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:51.709
To master.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:57.079
To master every chakra and every deity bestowed
upon it.

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:02.259
To master it, how to do it, I will tell you
this Guru puja no doubt.

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:03.679
Going to work it out.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:15.189
But this puja is to be done with full understanding,
and with full recognition that it’s a great

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:16.199
fortune.

00:13:16.199 --> 00:13:22.290
Even the Devas are jealous of you, all the
rishis are jealous of you, so many people

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.250
are jealous of you.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:29.610
The greatest advantage for you, greatest fortune.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:34.029
Make full use of it.

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:38.439
And they are very simple things that can please,
very simple.

00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:43.079
You know your Mother can be pleased with very,
very simple things.

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:44.850
It’s like that only.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:51.610
It’s how much heart you have put into it,
is the point.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.689
I think tomorrow we should have the puja,
today we have understood about it.

00:13:55.689 --> 00:14:01.279
It is more to be felt and understood and realised
than to be thought about.

00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:03.689
Because you’ll go into thoughtless awareness.

00:14:03.689 --> 00:14:06.089
It is more source of triggering.

00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:12.509
For example, I think I’ll ask Hari (Jairam)
to give the miracle we had yesterday, would

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:13.790
be [a] good idea.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:22.179
On our way we were coming, from…he was losing
his way throughout, and Regis (Camille) was

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:28.059
navigating him (laughter) so we were all lost!

00:14:28.059 --> 00:14:34.980
But then we had a miracle while coming back:
there was in M1 (road) a complete jam and

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.470
miles together we could see there is no movement.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:44.550
And suddenly, within two minutes, what happened,
what I told him, and how he worked it out.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:49.100
Hari has a problem you see, I think Felicity
(Payment) has the same mad problem.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.100
Where is she?

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.100
Is she there?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.100
Yes?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.569
You see, like, to get after everything, to
do it…

00:14:54.569 --> 00:14:58.579
Now he thought that I have told that you put
your attention inside.

00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:06.850
Now he has a slope in his left side, as she
has too, and when you do it too much inside,

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.529
you go on the slope.

00:15:08.529 --> 00:15:13.799
So Hari being a wiser person in this respect
because he’s not been a psychologist, he

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:19.079
does not do that much, but Felicity does that,
is to go over do it.

00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:24.110
I mean she goes down very very deep into her
subconscious.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.320
While Hari understands there’s something’s
going wrong.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.769
I never said that you get after anything.

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:35.859
Now, “put your attention inside” means:
if you get Realisation by that.

00:15:35.859 --> 00:15:39.689
If you don’t get Realisation, there’s
something wrong somewhere, you have lost your

00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:43.690
way, that’s the main point is.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.369
So I told Hari that, “You don’t put your
attention inside because you go on the slope,

00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:51.929
your car is such that it doesn’t go the
other way round, it goes into the slope, doesn’t

00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:54.819
go to the heart.

00:15:54.819 --> 00:16:00.730
So best thing is that now you [should] become
active outside and forget about it (the inside).

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.279
And after some time you’ll receive a balance."

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.079
I said “At this point.."

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:08.279
Now he was trying to worry about the traffic.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:09.279
The other Mr.

00:16:09.279 --> 00:16:12.199
‘Navigator’ (Regis) was also busy worrying
about it!

00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:17.810
So I said, “Now, just now, you do not pay
any attention anywhere, you just project outside

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:23.829
and think of everyone, how we are going to
get them realised” Only I said like this,

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:24.829
and he started doing it.

00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:28.639
I said, “You never see the trees, you never
do this” And then what happened?

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.639
You tell.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:30.639
Within 2 minutes time?

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:34.170
Everybody, Chaya (Camille, Regis’ wife)
was there, all of them.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.709
Suddenly they found that the whole M1 (road)
was empty and they were rushing fast, you

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:38.709
see.

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:42.139
There was not, hardly one or two cars.

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:45.319
The whole M1 was emptied, absolutely!

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:49.500
And they did not know how it happened.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.850
Just they were there.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.339
And none of the things that we were going….

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:57.109
Ray Harris: Was that yesterday afternoon on
the M1 Mother?

00:16:57.109 --> 00:16:59.239
Shri Mataji: Not today, yesterday

00:16:59.239 --> 00:17:00.239
Ray: Yesterday.

00:17:00.239 --> 00:17:05.010
Because I was on a coach there, and we were
in the traffic jam.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:11.139
Shri Mataji: Means you were in the traffic
jam! (laughter) The whole traffic jam

00:17:11.139 --> 00:17:16.779
Ray: We were 1 mile from the exit and it stopped
dead.

00:17:16.779 --> 00:17:22.720
And then we stayed there and suddenly it cleared
and there were no cars! (laughter)

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.579
Shri Mataji: Suddenly the whole thing cleared
up!

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.309
And suddenly, and they realised, and they
didn’t know how it cleared up.

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:30.740
He speeded the car, I said “How?”

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.960
He said, “The car, I don’t know” and
all the things that were in front of us, and

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.340
all that, God knows where they disappeared
[to]!

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.850
Such huge big things and on the sides and
this and that.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.980
Nothing!

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:50.130
This is what is maya that upsets you.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.530
Project yourself outside.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:18:00.530
There was another experience I told these
people was this: that there were two journalists,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.530
one Mr.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.399
Marathe and a friend who are Sahaja Yogis,
and I went to the journalist’s association,

00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:06.880
they had a meeting.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.059
And there is another one who told Me, “No,
no Mother I have complete faith in You because

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:15.070
there was a miracle that happened to a friend
of mine, Marathe, who is a Sahaja Yogi."

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.200
I said, “What happened?”

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:25.470
He said they were coming, by, from Poona down
to Bombay, and their brakes failed, and the

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:29.350
slopes, you see, on the ghats (mountains),
it moves very fast.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:34.240
And suddenly they saw a huge big truck coming
up, with all the lights on top, and they didn’t

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.159
know how to control, and they were about to
dash out.

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:39.659
Just they closed their eyes and they said,
“Now, Mother, save us!”

00:18:39.659 --> 00:18:48.110
And suddenly they found that the car had crossed
the thing, and the thing was moving upwards,

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.140
the truck was moving.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:56.600
They didn’t know, as if somebody had picked
up that car and put it on the other side.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.910
So these miracles can work out in case you
project yourself out.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.630
But for projecting outside, first you should
be cleansed inside.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:12.210
But for that also, all the time if your attention
[is like this -] “where am I catching?”

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.720
Then you go onto rationality.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.929
“I must be catching because of this, I must
be catching because of that."

00:19:18.929 --> 00:19:24.850
I have told you hundred times not to say ‘why’.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.590
Give up this word ‘why’.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.580
“Why am I catching?”

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.570
It will settle down.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.110
This maddening must go away!

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:43.820
You cannot answer ‘why’ of anything in
Sahaja Yoga, can you?

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.210
“Why did I meet you?”, “Why did you
get Realisation?”

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:54.760
Ask hundred questions, two hundred, three
hundred, five hundred – you will not have

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.760
any answer!

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.350
So give up that.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:08.990
It’s not your rationality, it’s the Grace,
it’s the whim of the Grace that’s working

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.760
it out!

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:21.090
What are you trying at?

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.950
Just ask for the Grace.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:24.950
Finished!

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:25.950
It’s silent.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:26.950
It works out.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:27.950
This is maddening!

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:28.950
You’ll become mad people.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.429
This is the greatest madness that people want
to know why of everything.

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:31.960
How can you understand?

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.380
You don’t have that chitti to understand
it.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.221
“[Mother] Can you explain?”

00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:39.221
How can I?

00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:43.400
If you make a little ant understand human
civilisation and this dirty politics you play

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400
it may understand.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.240
But you cannot understand ‘why’ of God.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.380
This is the relationship.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:53.960
So now, you give it up asking questions like
that.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.940
It’s too tremendous for this rationality.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.340
“Why God is doing?

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.649
How He does?

00:21:03.649 --> 00:21:04.940
What are His powers?”

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:10.519
Only thing [you can do] as scientists, you
note down – “Yes, it is so, yes, it is

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.320
so, yes it is so."

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.789
Verify it and note down.

00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:18.820
Only your awareness is changed from the scientist,
that you can see subtler working.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.110
But why it works?

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.110
That’s His whim!

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.110
He’ll do what He likes!

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.940
Who are you to question God?

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.260
How can you question God?

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:37.410
Just give up asking this question ‘why’
and you will feel very much better.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.330
“It is God, you see, He does it!”

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.640
This is what is faith.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.500
Not the blind, but real [faith], with understanding.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:50.509
I have told you this story of My grandmother
many a times, as she used to tell Me about

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:55.919
faith, and which I have repeated to you so
many times, but again I’ll repeat it today:

00:21:55.919 --> 00:22:02.750
There were three people at different places,
and one man was going to see God.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.960
So they came to know about it.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:13.200
So one of them was in the forest, standing
on his head, doing all kinds of yogas and

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:20.529
things like that, and praying to God – must
be with both hands towards Him, and soaking

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:28.360
the feet, may be – like mad, you see, and
asking, “Why don’t You meet me?

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.980
Why don’t You meet me?

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.529
I want to meet You! why don’t you meet me?”

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:39.000
And the man who was going to see God went
through that side, and He said, “Now please

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.960
go and ask Him why don’t You come and see
me?

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.519
You better come and see me, Why don’t You
do it?”

00:22:43.519 --> 00:22:50.299
So he said, “Alright, I’ll come, I’m
sorry” He had become thin, you see, absolutely

00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:52.720
thinned down, condition very miserable.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:59.700
He said, “Alright, I’ll go and tell God
about you."

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:05.440
So, then he went up to God, no, no, before
that.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:14.909
Then he met another type who was sitting on
the street, and will be at the street side,

00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:15.909
and he said, “Oh!

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:17.419
I heard you are going to meet God?”

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:20.769
He said: yes, he is going to meet God.

00:23:20.769 --> 00:23:24.880
So he said, “Then communicate one small
little thing."

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.940
He said, “What?”

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:36.360
He said that, “Just tell Him I have had
no food, please send me my food now, I’m

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360
hungry."

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.440
He said “What?”

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.070
“Yes, you just tell Him that much."

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.070
So he went up.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.070
He saw God.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.070
So God asked, “Did you meet some people
on your way?”

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.570
He said, “Yes, I met a horrible one who
is all time saying ‘Why not?

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:48.570
Why this?”

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.789
And “Why?”, “Should I do it and should
I not?’

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:54.149
And this and that, is going on.

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:57.011
So, will You go and meet him?

00:23:57.011 --> 00:23:58.011
He’s asking."

00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:03.419
He (God) said, “No, better tell him to do
it little more, you see… still he has to

00:24:03.419 --> 00:24:04.419
do.

00:24:04.419 --> 00:24:05.419
He requires more effort.

00:24:05.419 --> 00:24:06.419
He won’t be satisfied.

00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:09.730
Till he gives up his efforts, let him go on."

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.350
I mean he would have become mad like that.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.830
But now God says, “Alright, let him go ahead!

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.830
What to do?

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.830
If you tell them, they don’t want to listen,
so let them go ahead."

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:23.200
Then he said, “Then I met another mad fellow,
who was on the street, he said that ‘ I’m

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.410
hungry, ask God to send some food for me.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.410
Please ask.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.510
Tell God that I’m hungry.’

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.510
” He (God) said, “Really?”

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.510
He called all His managers He said, “Please
send his food.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.510
Have you not yet arranged his food and all
that?

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.510
Please arrange it."

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.100
He was quite surprised.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.160
He said, “What is this?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.730
This man is just telling ‘I’m hungry’,
and God is so much worried about this fellow

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.549
and not worried about the fellow who is standing
on his head and asking such a lot of questions

00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:46.549
to God."

00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:53.330
So God knows everything, so He told him, “Now,
alright you are going down, you just tell

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:57.490
them one story to both of them, and see their
reactions, and then you will know."

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.330
So He told him a story.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:08.330
“You tell them that, ‘I went to God and
saw there, God passing a camel through the

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.409
eye of a needle.’ ” and he said, “Really?”

00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:17.010
He said, “Yes, you go and tell them."

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.750
So he came down.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.790
This fellow was still on his head.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:24.840
He came back, “What did God say?”

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.360
He said you have to go on still for some time."

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.360
He said, “Oh!

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360
Really?

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.360
Well all glory to God!”

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.380
He said, “Yes, he said so."

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.380
He said, “Really?”

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.149
Then, “Did you see something special there?”

00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:39.509
He said, “Yes, I saw that He passed a camel
through the eye of a needle!”

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:43.299
He said, “No, no, don’t tell me stories!

00:25:43.299 --> 00:25:45.200
How can it?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.340
Such a big camel!

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.890
How can it pass through the eye?

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.559
After all it’s impossible!

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:51.809
It is impossible!

00:25:51.809 --> 00:25:53.059
This is impossible!

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:55.440
You are just now trying to befool me.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.470
Because you have been to God you think you
can befool me.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.200
No, no, I cannot take it, no, I cannot take
it!”

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.539
So he went to another fellow, he was nicely
eating his food.

00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:07.620
He said, “Yes!

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.980
I knew, you see, I just told you because you
asked me if you have to tell you anything,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.389
I knew God will send my food and everything.

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:15.460
I’m quite alright."

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.059
He said, “Did you see anything wondrous
there?”

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:25.289
He said, “I saw the wonder of wonders, miracles
of miracles, that God passed a camel through

00:26:25.289 --> 00:26:28.570
the eye of a needle!”

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.230
He said, “What is so miraculous?

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.230
He is God!

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.230
He’s God Almighty!

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.230
What?

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.929
He can pass even Universes after Universes
through that hole!

00:26:35.929 --> 00:26:37.970
What is it for God?

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.799
He is God Almighty don’t you understand
God Almighty?

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.200
Because you have met Him, you think He’s
nothing!

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.640
Because you did it so easily, you think He’s
nothing!

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.509
Because He behaves like [that] you think He’s
nothing!

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:52.240
He’s God Almighty!

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.409
So what?

00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:55.700
to Him, what is it?”

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.509
Then
he realised.

00:27:01.509 --> 00:27:02.509
This is Faith.

00:27:02.509 --> 00:27:05.799
That is what is enlightened within you with
puja.

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:10.100
Not your rationality which is brought down
actually quite a lot.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:16.840
So with this idea, tomorrow, we’ll have
the puja, alright?

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.330
May God Bless You.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:31.440
Sahaja Yogi: Jane just started labour, for
the baby.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.929
Shri Mataji: Has started?

00:27:35.929 --> 00:27:39.299
Good, good, good.

00:27:39.299 --> 00:27:43.789
It will work out.

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:51.529
In Jane’s case she never wanted a baby – big
problem, you see.

00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:57.720
Funny ideas about children are developing
in this horrible country, which is so shocking,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.279
so shocking.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:06.249
I mean the mother is the one who should have
feelings.

00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:10.509
Every day you read such horrible stories about
these mother’s.

00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:11.730
Can’t imagine!

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:18.830
They can be so cruel?

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.750
The more I read about these things, one can’t
understand.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.690
How can they be cruel?

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:33.679
I mean if you hear a little thorn has gone
into the feet of a child your heart starts

00:28:33.679 --> 00:28:38.990
melting, you know.

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:44.309
Innocence, is attack on innocence.

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:48.179
The whole country is after innocence.

00:28:48.179 --> 00:28:55.549
Is old men running after young girls, all
this is attack on innocence.

00:28:55.549 --> 00:29:03.000
I mean, extremely satanic, very satanic forces
are let loose.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:15.250
They are attacking all the children of the
world and everything.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.250
Yogini: Would You like some tea, Mother?

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.250
Would you like some tea?

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.110
Shri Mataji: No, but I think we’ll have
food.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.200
Better to have food.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.120
I’ve got some food for you.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:36.210
Heat it up and I hope you’ll like it.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:39.179
Now.

00:29:39.179 --> 00:29:43.809
Got something for her.

00:29:43.809 --> 00:30:03.820
Can you imagine where people are killing their
wives, their husbands?

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.549
Yesterday, today, My husband was telling Me
there was a case where a wife was killed and

00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:11.539
was put in the fridge, deep freeze.

00:30:11.539 --> 00:30:14.139
Can you imagine?

00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:18.789
And then Peter (Pierce) told another story
that a lady delivered her child in the loo

00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:20.509
and left the child [to] die there.

00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:22.840
I mean, this kind of people can you imagine?

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.519
They have only sex-love and a sort of dirty
feelings for others, they have never good,

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:29.039
pure feelings for anyone else.

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:32.570
What should you say to such people?

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.590
I just can’t understand.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.600
Very destructive.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.600
Satanic.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.480
You see but there must be something satanic
in people to accept such satanic things.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.659
I mean I cannot think of one case in India
– one case – where a mother could kill

00:30:47.659 --> 00:30:48.659
the child.

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:50.149
One case I cannot think.

00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:54.960
Even if it’s a illegitimate child she would
not like to kill but others may like to finish

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.549
it off.

00:30:56.549 --> 00:31:01.320
That’s different, but she would not.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:08.470
I mean just can’t think of such a thing.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.470
Unbelievable!

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.470
Unbelievable.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.830
They are so egoistical, so foolish.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.830
Donkeys they could be only.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.759
At the most donkeys are like that, I think,
that’s why Christ rode on the donkeys.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:24.110
Donkeys, are they egoistical?

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:29.970
I don’t think so, they are not.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:35.480
Moreover they are not also full of hatred,
donkeys are not full of hatred.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.840
They are stupid people.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.409
You see, somebody must bully them then they
are alright.

00:31:42.409 --> 00:31:49.330
The bullying starts like this: a French bullies
English, I have seen it, puts them down.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:55.340
French think they are higher than the [English].

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.009
See the gradation is in the opposite direction.

00:31:58.009 --> 00:32:01.740
They think that the English are lower; I think
definitely English are better than French

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:10.889
as far as evolution is concerned, but the
French have put them down.

00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:14.159
Yesterday I met – there was one Bangladeshi
who was going back to Bangladesh.

00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:15.730
He says, “Many have gone from here.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.899
People don’t know how many have gone; if
they write it down they’ll be amazed, because

00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:20.899
they are fed up."

00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:24.740
And funny, funny things, you see he told Me,
he lived with four types of neighbours and

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.900
he got so fed up with them.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:32.860
First neighbour he lived with, you see, he
said that, “He had a daughter and I had

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.809
a daughter of the same age, 14 years of age.

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:37.369
And he [the Englishman] said ‘Why shouldn’t
we exchange our daughters, you see, for lovemaking?’

00:32:37.369 --> 00:32:41.269
“ He got so angry and he ran away.

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:44.190
Shri Mataji laughing: How can he?

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.940
This was the first thing.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:52.490
Then the second one was, he said that, You
see, his daughter was – little nausea she

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.559
had or something.

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:55.340
She’s just 14 or something.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:00.039
So she went to the doctor and doctor said,
“Did you – have you start giving her [contraceptive]

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:01.309
pills and things, you see?”

00:33:01.309 --> 00:33:03.330
This upset him absolutely then.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:07.919
Like that he gave Me four horrible instances,
the two others I cannot tell you to what extent

00:33:07.919 --> 00:33:08.919
it is.

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:11.909
He said, “I’m not going to live in this
country."

00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:18.730
I mean, they are just like stud-bulls going
round, I tell you – horrible.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.190
And the women I don’t know what to call
them!

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.190
What is the parallel?

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.309
(laughing) Hawkers?

00:33:22.309 --> 00:33:23.509
Or what?

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:24.710
The Hawks?

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.499
What do you call the other side?

00:33:28.499 --> 00:33:29.639
Yogini: Hookers.

00:33:29.639 --> 00:33:31.340
Shri Mataji: Hooker?

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.340
Hookers.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.320
Yogini: They get paid for it.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.029
Shri Mataji: Ha?

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:38.389
Yogini: They get paid for it.

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:39.389
Shri Mataji: They get paid for.

00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:40.389
Yes they get paid for.

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:49.690
Shri Mataji: At least they can have a date
and have some nice food somewhere in the Chinese.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.000
(laughing).

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.730
Selling their chastity for cheap things.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.140
Different community altogether.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.990
It’s a very nice picture, eh?

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:20.640
There’s only a Radha and Krishna both together
in One Being.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.160
You have got of My eyes in many of My photographs.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.929
Some of these are.What is this one about?

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:28.210
Really terrible.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.140
Ramadan, you see.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:35.270
Yesterday I must tell you, where is he?

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.200
(Djamel) Yesterday Ramadan.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:44.850
Yesterday these Muslims came in, you see,
they were waiting for 8 [O’clock], something

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.430
time, you see?

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:48.410
And then they started drinking like hell,
I mean they drank so much of (laughter).

00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:50.060
By the way why did they do it?

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.960
In the daytime what happened?

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.740
What is the story?

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.080
Djamel Metouri: Why do they do it?

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.920
What do they do during the daytime?

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:09.893
Shri Mataji: No-no-no-no no, no, why – what
is the story, why did they fast?

00:35:09.893 --> 00:35:10.893
Djamel: Well it’s for the Koran, the Prophet
Mohammed decided that every year there should

00:35:10.893 --> 00:35:11.893
be a time when all the people should fast
to keep all their ?

00:35:11.893 --> 00:35:12.893
at bay.

00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:18.690
Akbar: To keep all the attentions at bay.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.550
Shri Mataji: They should fast – what…?

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:25.280
Yogi: They should fast for one month because
they have for at least one month in a year

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:32.160
to keep away, You know, temptation from drinking
and…

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:39.720
Because at the time they were very licentious,
You know they used to –

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:45.120
Shri Mataji: Dining and wining!

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:55.540
Djamel: Well they do still, but at the time
they were much more.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.550
Shri Mataji: They used to drink like anything.

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.960
So He said, “You better fast for one month,
because He thought if you put one month, at

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960
least for one day they will do it.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960
(Laughter)

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.700
You see this is how, you have to put an extreme
case, you see?

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.030
But people say that, “Why they put an extreme
case?”

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:16.250
Because, you see if you put an extreme case
then at least symbolically you’ll do for

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.560
one day or half a day.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.350
That was the reason, you see, because they
never believed in fasting.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:26.130
They used to eat, gluttonous people, you see,
horrible!

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:32.930
They were living in tribes and very much eating,
all the time attention was on eating.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.920
Djamel: It was not just that, You see all
men should not eat salt anywhere, You know

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.280
I mean –

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:43.320
Shri Mataji: That all will start there.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.660
Djamel: And you mustn’t listen to anything
harsh from people

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.430
Shri Mataji: This was only for His disciples.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.890
Djamel: He was trying too, Mother, and to
look at –

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.620
Shri Mataji: -women – adulterous eyes.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.620
That they all do!

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.250
You see, at least He must have thought that,
“Give one month a trial, the whole year

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.250
you can’t do.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:05.740
So, one month give a trial like that,” you
see so He said, “Alright, try for one month."

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:13.400
(laughing) But they can do fasting, is alright,
and then when did he say that, eat in the

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:19.480
morning and eat in the evening?

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.140
Djamel: Yes, it’s said that you must fast
from dark to –

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.720
Other yogi: Dawn to Dusk.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.180
Djamel: Moonrise, I mean.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.450
Shri Mataji: But they eat with vengeance at
both the times!

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.850
Djamel: But they do in the night, they eat…

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.390
Shri Mataji: …with vengeance, you see, so
everything is put upside down., Why He said

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.990
it because, you see, all these systems were
for his disciples.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:45.610
They would do Namaz for five times, He thought
that He might be able to achieve the Realization

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:46.970
part of it, you see.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.610
So He said, “All right, for one month, let’s
have a course like that."

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:56.060
See they went on a course, sort of thing,
“Let’s work it out."

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.910
And that thing has become a pattern now that
they fast.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.460
It’s all nonsense, it’s madness.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:12.240
Djamel: Mother I think it must be very good,
if someone is going to meditate, You know,

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.410
but for one whole month it’s a lot.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:27.290
Shri Mataji: See, if they are paying attention
to their food only, waiting for the time to

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:31.300
come to drink it’s nonsense!

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.460
Djamel: That’s what they do.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.840
Djamel: But people go extreme You see even
when they’re weak person.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.970
A person should be able to stand it.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.100
But they still do it.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.080
And they end up in hospitals and when they
die they’re considered as martyrs.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080
Shri Mataji: What do they say?

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.160
Djamel: You know it’s supposed to be very
good to die in Ramadan.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160
(laughter)

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.160
Shri Mataji: Imagine.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:52.170
Djamel: And if there is a war you must be
right in front line.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.540
Shri Mataji: Yes, like in the war you are
dying.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:01.650
That’s a war in a way, because you war against
your weaknesses, war against your habits and

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.120
things, it’s true, no doubt!

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:09.330
But that is a regular stuff, which one has
to do, but that’s not done, it’s something

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.330
very different, you know.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.730
Djamel: Crazy people live today, You know.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:22.441
Ray Harris: But You know, Mother, Jewish Rabbis
decide that it’s blasphemy today that you

00:39:22.441 --> 00:39:23.690
are trying to achieve union with God.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:24.690
Shri Mataji: Who says blasphemy?

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:25.690
Ray Harris: Jewish, a Jewish rabbi, Mother.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.690
Shri Mataji: Is it?

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.240
Ray Harris: And it said in the paper that
we should only do His commandments, to become

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.240
part of God is blasphemy.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.240
Shri Mataji: Aah, this is…

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240
Ray Harris: That’s what he said, Mother.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240
So we never aspire to achieve part of God
that..

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.770
Shri Mataji: Because then his salary will
go away.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.680
Ray Harris: Because it’s a silly eastern
religion.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:46.130
Shri Mataji: Actually this is what happened
with somebody who had come there, he says

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.230
that, “I don’t believe in Shankara."

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:53.470
He’s a South Indian he said, “I don’t
believe in Shankara, because he believes in

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.920
Advaita,” – that is “Becoming one,”
you see.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.710
Advaita – ‘Dvaita’ is two, ‘Adwaita’
means “not two”.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.660
“I don’t believe in Shankara’s Advaita,
I believe in dvaita, I want to remain myself,

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.241
I do not want to get united with God, I want
to remain myself.

00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:07.250
Why should -” I said “Which part of you
that doesn’t want to become with God?”,

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.250
He said “Not my ego,” I said, “How are
you sure?”

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.250
You see, this is the trick of the trade is.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.250
That’s how they are going to continue.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.250
That’s why they don’t want to be one with
God.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.250
Because if they have to be one with God, then
these in-between religions will disappear,

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:13.250
isn’t it.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.250
(laughter) The agency will be losing its powers!

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.250
End of tape

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.250
Reading of Devi Mahatmyam before Shri Mataji’s
talk on The meaning of Puja.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.250
Brighton, UK – July 19, 1980

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.250
Shri Mataji:…You have to conquer this war,
how?

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.250
Because this is our war.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.250
Loudly.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:21.250
Very loud.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.250
A Yogi reads from Chapter 3 & 4 of Devi Mahatmyam:

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.250
1-2.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.250
“Then Ciksura, the great asura general,
seeing that army being slain (by the Devi),

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:25.250
advanced in anger to fight with Ambika.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.250
That asura rained showers of arrows on the
Devi in the battle, even as a cloud (showers)

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.250
rains on the summit of Mount Meru.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.250
Then the Devi, easily cutting asunder the
masses of his arrows, killed his horses and

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.250
their controller with Her arrows.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.250
Forthwith She split his bow and lofty banner,
and with Her arrows pierced the body of that

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.250
(asura) whose bow had been cut.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.250
His bow shattered, his chariot broken, his
horses killed and his charioteer slain, the

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.250
asura armed with sword and shield rushed at
the Devi.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:34.250
Swiftly he smote the lion on the head with
his sharp-edged sword and struck the Devi

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.250
also on Her left arm.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:36.250
Shri Mataji tells some people where to sit.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.250
O king, his sword broke into pieces as it
touched Her arm.

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.250
Thereon his eyes turning red with anger, he
grasped his pike.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.250
Then the great asura flung at Bhadrakali the
pike, blazing with lustre, as if he was hurling

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.250
the very sun from the skies.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.250
Seeing that pike coming upon Her, the Devi
hurled Her pike, which shattered his pike

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.250
into a hundred fragments and shattered the
great asura himself.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:43.250
Mahisasura”s very valiant general having
been killed, Camara, the afflictor of Devas,

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.250
mounted on an elephant, advanced.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.250
He also hurled his spear at the Devi.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.250
Ambika quickly assailed it with a whoop, made
it lustreless and fall to the ground.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:47.250
Seeing his spear broken and fallen, Camara,
full of rage, flung a pike, and She split

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:48.250
that also with Her arrows.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.250
Then the lion, leaping up and seating itself
at the centre of the elephant”s forehead,

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.250
engaged itself in a hand to hand fight with
that foe of the Devas.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.250
Fighting, the two then came down to the earth
from the back of the elephant, and fought

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.250
very impetuously, dealing the most terrible
blows at each other.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.250
Then the lion, springing up quickly to the
sky, and descending, severed Camara”s head

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.250
with a blow from its paw.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.250
And Udagra was killed in the battle by the
Devi with stones, trees and the like, and

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.250
Karala also was stricken down by Her teeth
and fists and slaps.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:57.250
Shri Mataji: …Devas, you see?

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.250
Even they are useless sometimes.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.250
Enraged, the Devi ground Uddhata to powder
with the blows of Her club, and killed Baskala

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.250
with a dart and destroyed Tamara and Andhaka
with arrows.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.250
The three-eyed Supreme Isvaari killed Ugrassya
and Ugravirya –

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.250
Shri Mataji corrects: Ishvari said with stress
on the “Ish”, Ugrasya said with stress

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:03.250
on the “ya."

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.250
Yogi continues:

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.250
“…and Mahahanu also with Her trident.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:06.250
With Her sword She struck down Bidaala”s
head from his body,

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.250
Shri Mataji corrects: Bidala stress on “Bi."

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.250
Yogi continues:

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.250
“…and dispatched both Durdhara and Durmukha
to the abode of Death with Her arrows.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.250
As his army was thus being destroyed, Mahisasura
terrified the troops of the Devi with his

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:11.250
own buffalo form.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.250
Some (he laid low) by a blow of his muzzle,
some by stamping with his hooves, some by

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.250
the lashes of his tail, and others by the
pokes of his horns.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.250
Some he laid low on the face of the earth
by his impetuous speed, some by his bellowing

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.250
and wheeling movement, and others by the blast
of his breath.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.250
Having laid low Her army, Mahisasura rushed
to slay the lion of the Mahadevi.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.250
This enraged Ambika.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.250
Yogi realizes he has been leaving out the
middle “s” in “Mahisasura” but struggles

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.250
to get it right, Shri Mataji helps the yogi
to say “Mahishasura."

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.250
Mahisasura, great in valour, pounded the surface
of the earth with his hooves in rage, tossed

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.250
up the high mountains with his horns, and
bellowed terribly.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.250
Crushed by the velocity of his wheeling, the
earth disintegrated, and lashed by his tail,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:23.250
the sea overflowed all around.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.250
Pierced by his swaying horns, the clouds went
into fragments.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.250
Cast up by the blast of his breath, mountains
fell down from the sky in hundreds.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:26.250
Seeing the great asura swollen with rage and
advancing towards Her, Chandika displayed

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:27.250
Her wrath in order to slay him.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.250
She flung Her noose over him and bound the
great asura.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.250
Thus bound in the great battle, he quitted
his buffalo form.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.250
Then he became a lion suddenly.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.250
While Ambika cut off the head (of his lion
form), he took the appearance of a man with

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.250
sword in hand.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.250
Immediately then the Devi with Her arrows
chopped off the man together with his sword

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.250
and shield.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.250
Then he became a big elephant.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.250
(The elephant) tugged at Her great lion with
his trunk and roared loudly, but as he was

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.250
dragging, the Devi cut off his trunk with
Her sword.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.250
The great asura then resumed his buffalo shape
and shook the three worlds with their movable

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.250
and immovable objects.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.250
Enraged thereat, Chandika, the Mother of the
worlds, quaffed a divine drink again and again,

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:41.250
and laughed, Her eyes becoming red.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.250
35, And the asura, also roared intoxicated
with his strength and valour, and hurled mountains

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:43.250
against Chandika with his horns.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.250
And She with showers of arrows pulverized
(those mountains) hurled at Her, and spoke

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.250
to him in flurried words, the colour of Her
face accentuated with the intoxication of

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.250
the divine drink.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.250
The Devi said:

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.250
37-38.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:49.250
“Roar, roar, O fool, for a moment while
I drink this wine.

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.250
When you are slain by me, the Devas will soon
roar in this very place."

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.250
Shri Mataji: The wine doesn’t mean fermented
wine… today.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.250
Ha.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:53.250
Yogi continues:

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:54.250
“The Rishi said:

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.250
39-40.

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:56.250
Having exclaimed thus, She jumped and landed
herself on that great asura, pressed him on

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.250
the neck with Her foot and struck him with
Her spear.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:58.250
And thereupon, caught up under Her foot.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.250
Mahisasura half issued forth (in his real
form) from his own (buffalo) mouth, being

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.250
completely overcome by the valour of the Devi.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:01.250
Fighting thus with his half-revealed form,
the great asura was laid by the Devi who struck

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:02.250
off his head with Her great sword.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.250
Then, crying in consternation, the whole asura
army perished; and all the hosts of Devas

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:04.250
were in great exultation.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.250
With the great sages of heaven, the Devas
praised the Devi.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:06.250
The Gandharva chiefs sang and the bevies of
apsaras danced.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.250
Here ends the third chapter called “The
Slaying of Mahisasura”

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.250
Shri Mataji: Read that little bit, when he’s
been slain verses.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:09.250
He’s again born, you know that, everyone.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:10.250
Yogi repeats the requested verses:

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:11.250
“The Devi said:

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.250
37-38.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.250
“Roar, roar, O fool, for a moment while
I drink this wine.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:14.250
When you are slain by me, the Devas will soon
roar in this very place."

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:15.250
The Rishi said:

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:16.250
39-40.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:17.250
Having exclaimed thus, She jumped and landed
herself on that great asura, pressed him on

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:18.250
the neck with Her foot and struck him with
Her spear.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.250
And thereupon, caught up under Her foot.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.250
Mahisasura half issued forth (in his real
form) from his own (buffalo) mouth, being

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.250
completely overcome by the valour of the Devi.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.250
Fighting thus with his half-revealed form,
the great asura was laid by the Devi who struck

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.250
off his head with Her great sword.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.250
Then, crying in consternation, the whole asura
army perished; and all the hosts of Devas

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:25.250
were in great exultation.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:26.250
With the great sages of heaven, the Devas
praised the Devi.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:27.250
The Gandharva chiefs sang and the bevies of
apsaras danced.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.250
Shri Mataji: Now the second part is the Devas
praise then the Devi.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.250
That’s a very good one.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.250
Read it also, Marcus.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.250
“The Rishi said:

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.250
1-2.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.250
When that most valiant but evil-natured Mahisasura
–

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.250
Shri Mataji: Rishi’s the, what you call,
Rishi’s the one who is relating the story.

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:35.250
Yogi continues:

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.250
“When that most valiant but evil-natured
Mahisasura and the army of that foe of the

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:37.250
Devas were destroyed by the Devi, Indra and
the hosts of Devas uttered words of praise,

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:38.250
their necks and shoulders reverently bent,
and their bodies rendered beautiful with horripilation

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.250
and exultation.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.250
“To that Ambika who is worthy of worship
by all Devas

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:41.250
A child cries and Shri Mataji asks: Can you
take the child out a little for a while?

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:42.250
At the back, you see?

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:43.250
You can sit beyond Linda, would be good idea.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:44.250
Alright?

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:45.250
When the thing will be over then you can bring
the baby in.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:46.250
Ha.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.250
Hm.

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:48.250
Yogi continues:

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.250
“To that Ambika who is worthy of worship
by all Devas and sages and pervades this world

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.250
by Her power and who is the embodiment of
the entire powers of all the hosts of Devas,

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.250
we bow in devotion.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:52.250
May She grant us auspicious things!

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.250
Shri Mataji: Did you hear that?

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:54.250
“Embodiment of all the powers."

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:55.250
Yogi continues:

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.250
“May Chandika, whose incomparable greatness
and power Bhagavan Vishnu, Brahma and Hara

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.250
are unable to describe, –

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.250
Shri Mataji: Hara is Shiva.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.250
Yogi continues:

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.250
“…bestow Her mind on protecting the entire
world and on destroying the fear of evil.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.250
“O Devi, we bow before You, who are yourself
good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous,

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.250
and ill-fortune in those of the vicious, intelligence
in the hearts of the learned, faith in the

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.250
hearts of the good, and modesty in the hearts
of the high-born.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.250
May You protect the universe!

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.250
Shri Mataji: This is a prayer.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.250
Yogi continues:

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.250
“O Devi, how can we describe Your inconceivable
form, or Your abundant surpassing valour that

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.250
destroys the asuras, or Your wonderful feats
displayed in battles among all the hosts of

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.250
gods, asuras and others?

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.250
“You are the origin of all the worlds!

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.250
Though You are possessed of the three gunas
You are not known to have any of their attendant

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:12.250
defects (like passion)!

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.250
You are incomprehensible even to Vishnu, Siva
and others!

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:14.250
You are the resort of all!

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.250
The entire world is composed of an infinitesimal
portion of yourself!

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.250
You are verily the supreme primordial Prakriti
untransformed.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.250
“O Devi, You are Svaha at whose utterance
the whole assemblage of gods attain satisfaction

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.250
in all the sacrifices.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.250
You are the Svadha which gives satisfaction
to the manes.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.250
Therefore You are chanted (as Svaha and Svadha
in Sacrifices) by people.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.250
“O Devi, You are Bhagavati, the supreme
Vidya which is the cause of liberation, and

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:22.250
great inconceivable penances (are the means
for your realization).

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.250
You (the supreme knowledge) are cultivated
by sages who desire liberation, whose senses

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.250
are well restrained, who are devoted to Reality,
and have shed all the blemishes.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.250
Shri Mataji: See.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.250
That’s why very few people stick on to Sahaj
Yoga.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:27.250
The description of sages is clear-cut.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.250
Again read it?

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.250
Yogi repeats and continues:

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.250
“O Devi, You are Bhagavati, the supreme
Vidya which is the cause of liberation, and

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.250
great inconceivable penances (are the means
for your realization).

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:32.250
You (the supreme knowledge) are cultivated
by sages who desire liberation, whose senses

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:33.250
are well-restrained, -“

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:34.250
Shri Mataji: “Senses are well restrained."

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.250
Yogi:

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.250
“…who are devoted to Reality,”

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.250
Shri Mataji: “Who are devoted to Reality."

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.250
Yogi:

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:39.250
“…and have shed all the blemishes.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.250
“You are the soul of Sabda-Brahman.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.250
You are the repository of the very pure Ri…”

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.250
Yogi gets tongue tied on the words “Rig-veda”.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:43.250
Shri Mataji asks: You are what?

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.250
Yogi unsure: Rishis?

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.250
Shri Mataji: Rishis are the people who are
saints or sages.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.250
Yogi:

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.250
“You are the repository of the very pure
Rishis.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.250
sic

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.250
Shri Mataji: All the sages, you see they are
repositories.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.250
Is all the sages.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.250
Yogi continues:

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:52.250
“…and Yajus hymns, and of Samans, the
recital of whose words is beautiful

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.250
Shri Mataji: These are Vedas.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:54.250
Yogi continues:

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.250
“…with the Udgitha!

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.250
You are Bhagavati embodying the three Vedas.

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.250
And You are the sustenance whereby life is
maintained.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.250
You are the supreme destroyer of the pain
of all the worlds.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.250
“O Devi, You are the Intellect, by which
the essence of all the scriptures is comprehended.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.250
You are Durga, the boat that takes men across
the difficult ocean of worldly existence,

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.250
devoid of attachments.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.250
You are Shri Laksmi who has invariably taken
Her abode in the heart of Vishnu.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.250
You are indeed Gauri who has established herself
with Siva.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.250
“Gently smiling, pure, resembling the full
moon’s orb, beautiful like the splendour

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:05.250
of excellent gold was Your face!

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:06.250
Yet it was very strange that, being swayed
by anger, Mahisasura suddenly struck Your

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.250
face when he saw it.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.250
“Far stranger is it that after seeing Your
wrathful face, O Devi, terrible with its frowns

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.250
and red in hue like the rising moon, that
Mahisasura did not forthwith give up his life!

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:10.250
For, who can live after beholding the enraged
Destroyer?

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:11.250
“O Devi, be propitious.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.250
You are Supreme.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.250
If enraged, You forthwith destroy the (asura)
families for the welfare (of the world).

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.250
This was known the very moment the extensive
forces of Mahisasura were brought to their

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.250
end.

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.250
“You who are always bounteous, those (fortunate
ones) with whom You are well pleased, are

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:17.250
indeed the object of esteem in the country,
theirs are riches, theirs are glories, and

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.250
their acts of righteousness perish not; they
are indeed blessed and possessed of devoted

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.250
children, servants and wives.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.250
“By Your grace, O Devi, the blessed individual
does daily all righteous deeds with utmost

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.250
care and thereby attains to heaven.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:22.250
Are You not, therefore O Devi, the bestower
of reward in all the three worlds?

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.250
“When called to mind in a difficult pass,
You remove fear for every person.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.250
When called to mind by those in happiness,
You bestow a mind still further pious.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.250
Which goddess but You, O Dispeller of poverty,
pain and fear, has an ever sympathetic heart

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.250
for helping everyone?

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:27.250
“The world attains happiness by the killing
of these (foes) and though these (asuras)

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:28.250
have committed sins enough to keep them long
in hell, let them reach heaven by meeting

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.250
death eventually at the battle (with me)-
thinking thus, that You, O Devi, certainly

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.250
destroy our enemies.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.250
“Don’t” You reduce to ashes all asuras
by mere sight?

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:32.250
But You direct Your weapons against them so
that even the inimical ones, purified by the

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.250
missiles, may attain the higher worlds.

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:34.250
Such is Your most kindly intention towards
them.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.250
“If the eyes of the asuras had not been
put out by the terrible flashes of the mass

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.250
of light issuing from Your sword or by the
copious lustre of Your spearpoint, it is because

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:37.250
they saw also Your face resembling the moon,
giving out (cool) rays.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:38.250
“O Devi, Your nature is to subdue the conduct
of the wicked; this Your peerless beauty is

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:39.250
inconceivable for others; Your power destroys
those who have robbed the Devas of their prowess,

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.250
and You have thus manifested Your compassion
even towards the enemies.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.250
“What is Your prowess to be compared to?

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:42.250
Where can one find this beauty (of Yours)
most charming, (yet) striking fear in enemies?

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.250
Compassion in heart and relentlessness in
battle are seen, O Devi, O Bestower of boons,

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:44.250
only in You in all the three worlds!

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.250
“Through the destruction of the enemies
all these three worlds have been saved by

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:46.250
You.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.250
Having killed them in the battle-front, You
have led even those hosts of enemies to heaven,

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.250
and You have dispelled our fear of the frenzied
enemies of the Devas.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.250
Salutation to You!

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.250
“O Devi, protect us with Your spear.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.250
O Ambika, protect us with Your sword, protect
us by the sound of Your bell and by the twang

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.250
of Your bow-string.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.250
“O Candika, guard us in the east, in the
west, in the north and in the south by the

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:54.250
brandishing of Your spear.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.250
O Iswari!

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.250
“Protect us and the earth with those lovely
forms of Yours moving about in the three worlds,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.250
as also with Your exceedingly terrible forms.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.250
“O Ambika, protect us on every side with
Your sword, spear and club and whatever other

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.257
weapons Your sprite-like (soft) hand has touched."
