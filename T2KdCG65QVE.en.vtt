WEBVTT

01:20.834 --> 01:25.542
Today is a great day for all of us

01:35.000 --> 01:40.750
that we are celebrating Navaratri today

01:41.083 --> 01:48.083
and all of us are meeting after such a long time of My tour.

01:53.583 --> 01:56.917
When in Italy I said that

01:57.208 --> 02:06.041
England is the heart of the universe,

02:06.291 --> 02:09.125
they would not accept it.

02:09.542 --> 02:12.291
They were very shocked at this statement.

02:12.542 --> 02:19.166
They couldn't believe that England could be the heart of the universe.

02:19.999 --> 02:26.166
One of the reasons was that they felt that

02:30.417 --> 02:37.417
that the English people were invaded once by Romans,

02:40.041 --> 02:45.250
and Romans at that time also had felt

02:45.500 --> 02:49.500
that English were very bumptious people.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.291
They would not even accept the defeat

02:52.500 --> 02:56.083
with the grace of a person who is lost.

02:56.333 --> 03:00.291
Even if they were lost, they used to be bumptious.

03:00.542 --> 03:03.000
So they could not believe how could it be

03:03.208 --> 03:06.125
that the English is the heart of the universe.

03:06.333 --> 03:11.125
If this is the heart, what's the situation of the universe?

03:11.750 --> 03:17.792
And then they described to Me at length the bumptiousness of the English,

03:18.375 --> 03:24.875
and then I felt I have known something like that Myself.

03:26.166 --> 03:31.542
Now, when we are celebrating the greatest of greatest this Navaratri,

03:31.792 --> 03:35.083
there must be something special about it,

03:35.333 --> 03:40.875
that we have to cleanse this heart completely,

03:42.083 --> 03:45.125
fully

03:47.166 --> 03:51.792
and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood

03:52.000 --> 03:56.750
that passes through the whole of the body.

03:58.041 --> 04:00.625
So the cells of this heart,

04:00.875 --> 04:04.625
which has made this great organ,

04:04.875 --> 04:12.291
has to be the best, because the cells of the heart

04:13.208 --> 04:21.792
within a human body are the best cells,

04:22.625 --> 04:26.500
the highest quality, the most sensitive.

04:28.959 --> 04:36.041
And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata,

04:37.375 --> 04:42.417
the sound that is without percussion.

04:44.875 --> 04:48.959
While we find

04:49.166 --> 04:54.500
that there are some people of caliber, there are,

04:54.709 --> 05:00.250
but others talk more, show off more,

05:00.500 --> 05:04.250
and do not have the caliber.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.291
Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

05:11.583 --> 05:17.000
because you are born on the special land of England.

05:17.999 --> 05:22.291
That possibility must be built within you.

05:22.583 --> 05:26.417
But then what is lacking?

05:28.375 --> 05:32.500
Why is it, that with all the possibility,

05:32.792 --> 05:36.083
with all the great background,

05:36.333 --> 05:42.250
with all the merits to be here,

05:42.542 --> 05:44.625
why is it we find

05:44.875 --> 05:51.875
that Sahaja yogis for years together do not come up to many others.

05:52.417 --> 05:55.333
What is the reason?

05:55.750 --> 06:00.458
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate

06:00.709 --> 06:05.125
and it moves with a certain sound,

06:05.333 --> 06:08.834
and you can even get it on to a graph

06:09.083 --> 06:11.333
and it is so systematic,

06:11.625 --> 06:15.291
it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

06:15.583 --> 06:18.959
that even a slightest murmur,

06:19.166 --> 06:23.834
or slightest change shows on the graph.

06:24.166 --> 06:28.000
Is a very sensitive thing.

06:28.333 --> 06:33.542
And that is what is lacking here, is that discipline of the heart.

06:33.792 --> 06:38.291
It's an erratic, funny heart

06:38.959 --> 06:42.500
which swells up in ego.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.542
And whatever one may talk,

06:45.792 --> 06:47.917
this is another reading people have,

06:48.125 --> 06:51.875
that whatever you may tell them, that time seriously they listen to you

06:52.083 --> 06:56.250
and second moment it has no effect on them.

06:58.291 --> 07:02.083
So this is another thing we should see that if it is within us,

07:02.333 --> 07:08.083
let us understand that what we lack is disciplining.

07:08.959 --> 07:15.959
And that disciplining has to come, otherwise our caliber cannot improve.

07:19.291 --> 07:25.542
But for all that, I think what we should have is innate intelligence.

07:25.834 --> 07:29.125
No education, innate intelligence.

07:29.417 --> 07:36.417
Innate intelligence to understand that our caliber has to improve.

07:41.083 --> 07:45.250
Now here pulsates the Spirit,

07:47.041 --> 07:52.166
the Spirit and not the Power.

07:52.959 --> 07:56.041
The witness,

07:56.583 --> 07:59.917
the one that watches,

08:00.208 --> 08:03.083
that is the reflection of God,

08:03.333 --> 08:10.458
who is the Spectator of the work of the Devi.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.875
Actually what happens

08:14.083 --> 08:19.166
that without rising up to that status

08:19.875 --> 08:20.542
if we also say,

08:20.750 --> 08:26.166
"All right, we are also watching because we are the Spirit,"

08:27.166 --> 08:32.583
then we do not achieve that caliber.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.417
And with all the blessings,

08:35.667 --> 08:42.667
like seven auras of the heart, we have got seven ashrams.

08:46.250 --> 08:52.959
We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.375
Only to take advantage

08:56.625 --> 09:00.792
or to be in the Sahaja Yoga

09:01.041 --> 09:04.375
to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

09:04.625 --> 09:12.625
is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

09:16.583 --> 09:18.583
And warning has to be given now.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.625
Very important is at this juncture

09:21.834 --> 09:25.625
when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off, remember this,

09:25.875 --> 09:29.250
the speed has been gained and it is taking off.

09:29.542 --> 09:34.041
Those who will be left behind, will be left behind.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.542
So don't get into bumptiousness.

09:38.792 --> 09:41.500
First is your character, as everybody says,

09:41.750 --> 09:44.959
"They are very bumptious."

09:47.750 --> 09:52.583
Try to be humble

09:52.875 --> 09:56.792
and then understand that you have to be in the plane

09:56.999 --> 10:00.834
and not left behind on the grounds.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.999
It is moving fast.

10:07.542 --> 10:14.875
Now the most fortunate thing is

10:15.166 --> 10:17.792
that today is the Navaratri

10:18.041 --> 10:21.083
and that I should be in London

10:21.333 --> 10:25.500
and this Navaratri Puja should be performed here.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.250
No other country is that privileged,

10:28.542 --> 10:32.500
because this is the highest puja,

10:35.417 --> 10:40.417
the greatest ritual, which you can attend.

10:44.333 --> 10:48.458
So why do we do Navaratri?

10:51.083 --> 10:56.625
In the heart, to do Navaratri is to accept

10:58.542 --> 11:02.709
the powers of the Shakti,

11:04.291 --> 11:08.500
to realize the power

11:08.917 --> 11:13.542
that all these chakras have got in themselves,

11:14.625 --> 11:16.959
and that when they are enlightened

11:17.125 --> 11:20.834
how you can express all these powers

11:21.083 --> 11:24.041
of these nine chakras within ourselves;

11:24.333 --> 11:28.583
the seven chakras plus the heart and the moon makes it nine.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.625
But I would say that

11:30.834 --> 11:35.959
seven of these and on top of that we should say two more centers,

11:36.166 --> 11:41.875
which Blake has described surprisingly as nine centers, clearly.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.375
Just now I cannot talk of the higher two centers,

11:44.667 --> 11:50.166
but let us at least talk of the seven centers.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.792
The power of these centers,

11:53.999 --> 11:57.999
have we been able to develop within ourselves?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.333
How can you do it? You have no time.

12:00.625 --> 12:06.250
You are all busy people and bumptious.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.333
So now to develop these powers

12:11.625 --> 12:16.125
we have to concentrate on these chakras.

12:16.458 --> 12:19.125
Everywhere I went, I was surprised,

12:19.375 --> 12:22.208
the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

12:22.458 --> 12:27.125
Nobody talked about their family,house, jobs or

12:27.375 --> 12:31.166
any other nonsensical thing like

12:31.417 --> 12:34.041
unemployment and all that.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.041
They just asked Me,

12:35.250 --> 12:39.583
"Mother, how do we develop the power of this chakra,

12:39.792 --> 12:42.250
or that chakra or that chakra?"

12:42.875 --> 12:46.792
And I asked them, "How is it you are asking about a particular chakra?"

12:47.041 --> 12:50.834
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us,

12:52.792 --> 12:57.458
specially in me this one is not all right."

13:02.750 --> 13:07.041
This is another negativity to make My throat all right.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.625
Now for a realized soul

13:43.999 --> 13:47.125
there is no need for Me to discipline you or to tell you all these things,

13:47.417 --> 13:51.625
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today.

13:51.875 --> 13:56.834
But I have discovered, that if I do not warn you now,

13:57.083 --> 14:02.083
tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you.

14:02.375 --> 14:07.166
Take it as a serious warning.

14:09.999 --> 14:13.083
Now after Realization

14:13.333 --> 14:17.166
there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

14:17.417 --> 14:20.083
because you have got the light,

14:20.333 --> 14:25.875
you have known what is Realization,

14:26.291 --> 14:31.458
you have known what it means to be realized,

14:31.709 --> 14:35.542
and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

14:35.834 --> 14:40.208
how much your personality has improved.

14:41.750 --> 14:48.417
But, there is something more that has to be done.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.583
Is to see for yourself,

14:52.834 --> 14:57.375
if you have really disciplined yourself or not.

14:57.667 --> 15:00.208
There is no need for any leader to tell you,

15:00.458 --> 15:04.750
there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you,

15:04.999 --> 15:08.917
there is no need for anyone to tell you.

15:09.125 --> 15:13.000
It is you, who is a realized soul,

15:13.291 --> 15:16.208
you are your own master,

15:16.458 --> 15:22.125
you are your own guru. Imagine you are all gurus,

15:22.500 --> 15:28.250
great gurus and satgurus, respected saints

15:28.500 --> 15:33.625
where all the angels have to shower you with flowers.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.834
Think of it.

15:36.041 --> 15:42.041
And here you are bumptiously giving lectures, talking bumptiously.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.500
Very embarrassing even for the deities.

15:46.750 --> 15:52.166
They don't know what to do, whether to garland you or to shut your mouth.

15:52.625 --> 15:59.166
Here you are who have been,

16:18.208 --> 16:21.417
here you are in such a great position

16:21.667 --> 16:24.959
that you have got Realization.

16:25.542 --> 16:29.959
That only thing you have to accept

16:30.208 --> 16:36.375
the beauty of this great yoga,

16:37.125 --> 16:44.166
that you just enlighten your own powers,

16:44.458 --> 16:47.208
which are on these seven chakras.

16:47.500 --> 16:54.083
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs to the power of Gauri,

16:54.458 --> 17:00.709
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.500
Gauri's power.

17:05.709 --> 17:08.208
Tremendous they are, aren't they?

17:08.500 --> 17:12.291
Because of Her power you have got your Realization.

17:12.583 --> 17:16.041
Now what have we done

17:17.625 --> 17:21.999
to enshrine that power within ourselves?

17:22.750 --> 17:25.875
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,

17:26.041 --> 17:29.750
let us see what have we done?

17:32.834 --> 17:39.709
Have we been able to develop our innocence within ourselves?

17:43.333 --> 17:46.625
When people talk, they are so sharp.

17:46.917 --> 17:50.083
How can you be sharp, if you are innocent?

17:50.375 --> 17:53.291
They are so bumptious.

17:53.542 --> 17:56.417
How can you be that, if you are innocent?

17:56.709 --> 17:58.250
People play games.

17:58.500 --> 18:02.500
How can you do that, if you are innocent?

18:02.709 --> 18:03.875
Harm each other.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.875
How can it be, if you are innocent?

18:08.250 --> 18:11.291
So first of all you have to see yourself,

18:11.542 --> 18:14.999
that the power of innocence, if it has to live,

18:15.208 --> 18:19.333
all the rest of the nonsense has to go away.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.583
If you want to have the innocence,

18:24.834 --> 18:30.000
all that is anti-innocence has to be dropped out.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.834
I can understand about people, who are ignorant,

18:35.041 --> 18:36.250
who have ignorance.

18:36.542 --> 18:40.500
Then in ignorance, of course how will they talk of innocence.

18:40.750 --> 18:44.375
But you are not ignorant people. You are knowledgeable,

18:44.625 --> 18:47.208
you've got your enlightenment.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.542
And the power of innocence is so great.

18:50.792 --> 18:55.250
It makes you absolutely fearless, not bumptious, but fearless.

18:55.542 --> 19:00.792
And the greatest thing of innocence is that you are respectful.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.709
The sense of respect,

19:06.709 --> 19:08.750
if it is not developed within you,

19:08.999 --> 19:14.417
if you cannot develop the sense of respect for other Sahaja Yogis,

19:14.667 --> 19:18.792
for other people, for the ashrams, for the discipline

19:19.000 --> 19:22.667
and your own self-respect,

19:22.875 --> 19:27.750
then it is of no use, even talking of Sahaja Yoga,

19:27.959 --> 19:31.583
because that is the very beginning of it.

19:32.417 --> 19:36.250
First you do not respect, all right, you are bumptious, all right,

19:36.542 --> 19:42.500
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they call it,

19:42.792 --> 19:45.208
riding a fast horse,

19:45.417 --> 19:48.709
all that is there is all right, is forgiven.

19:48.999 --> 19:51.417
But once you have seen the light,

19:51.667 --> 19:57.458
you must try to get rid of all the snakes

19:57.750 --> 20:00.917
that you have been holding on to.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.125
Is a simple thing.

20:07.458 --> 20:11.041
In your childlike nature only,

20:11.667 --> 20:15.542
you can receive the blessings of Gauri, otherwise you cannot.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.500
You have to be really childlike,

20:18.709 --> 20:24.500
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use telling you anything,

20:24.709 --> 20:26.875
because you think you're too clever.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.417
To such a person, who thinks he is too clever,

20:29.625 --> 20:31.000
what's the use of talking to such a person,

20:31.208 --> 20:34.750
because he already knows everything.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.667
So the first power when you develop,

20:37.917 --> 20:42.709
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth, first of all.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.291
You must respect the Mother Earth,

20:45.542 --> 20:49.041
because the first chakra is made out of the Mother Earth.

20:49.333 --> 20:55.166
Try to be more settled down with yourself on Mother Earth.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.250
And the respect.

20:58.458 --> 21:04.291
See the trees when they get their flowers,

21:04.583 --> 21:06.458
they are not so respectful,

21:06.667 --> 21:09.750
but when they are laden by the fruits,

21:10.000 --> 21:14.291
they bow down to Mother Earth.

21:15.542 --> 21:21.208
In the same way when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

21:21.458 --> 21:24.834
you all must bow down.

21:27.750 --> 21:31.959
And innocence has a special capacity

21:32.166 --> 21:36.542
to make a person extremely peaceful,

21:37.500 --> 21:39.583
extremely peaceful.

21:39.834 --> 21:45.417
All the anger, temper, violence -

21:45.667 --> 21:49.125
if a person doesn't have innocence,

21:49.417 --> 21:54.291
it cannot come in you,

21:54.583 --> 21:57.625
because a person who is not innocent

21:57.917 --> 22:03.333
is either sly or aggressive.

22:04.667 --> 22:07.250
He cannot have peace within his heart.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.709
But a innocent person is not bothered, innocently he lives,

22:10.999 --> 22:17.208
he enjoys everything in complete peace and harmony.

22:19.250 --> 22:27.375
But this violence comes when a person becomes clever.

22:27.667 --> 22:30.917
He thinks, "I am so clever, the another one is so stupid,

22:31.125 --> 22:34.834
I have a right to shout at that person."

22:35.625 --> 22:41.125
And the one who is not innocent is never wise.

22:41.417 --> 22:44.750
He may be to look at look sharp, but he is not wise.

22:44.999 --> 22:49.125
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

22:49.417 --> 22:53.333
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.917
That is what one has to see.

22:59.125 --> 23:03.250
When your power

23:03.583 --> 23:07.917
of innocence increases, wisdom is apparent.

23:08.208 --> 23:11.875
People say, "That fellow is very wise."

23:12.125 --> 23:15.917
For example if somebody is crying about his wife,

23:16.166 --> 23:18.542
a wise person will say, "Oh, Baba,

23:18.792 --> 23:21.750
just look at this, still busy with his wife."

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
Another one is crying about his house or something.

23:24.166 --> 23:29.041
He will say, "Oh, look at this one, still busy with the house."

23:30.125 --> 23:34.250
There is no end to it.

23:35.709 --> 23:42.959
I've known people who get so swollen up

23:43.999 --> 23:48.709
that they think they must give a big lecture for one hour,

23:48.917 --> 23:50.000
on Sahaja Yoga.

23:50.291 --> 23:53.625
Unless and until they have given one hour lecture,

23:53.917 --> 23:59.041
they do not think their ego has manifested itself fully.

23:59.333 --> 24:01.917
But a wise person,

24:02.208 --> 24:07.667
he doesn't have to talk or speak or do anything.

24:07.917 --> 24:10.999
He impresses his silence,

24:11.250 --> 24:15.999
his wisdom on others much more easily.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
That is what we have to see,

24:18.709 --> 24:22.125
have we been able to discipline ourselves?

24:22.375 --> 24:26.750
Because our growth is very much in the beginning of it.

24:26.999 --> 24:30.625
We have to grow quite a lot

24:31.000 --> 24:33.792
And people don't understand this point

24:34.000 --> 24:38.834
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

24:39.083 --> 24:43.875
that you have to grow, you have not yet grown.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.750
You have to grow a lot.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.083
And when you grow

24:50.291 --> 24:56.792
you find this wisdom really fragrant with compassion.

24:57.041 --> 25:01.500
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

25:02.875 --> 25:06.625
Such beautiful compassion

25:06.917 --> 25:10.750
can emit through your being,

25:11.041 --> 25:14.166
that anybody who comes in contact with you,

25:14.417 --> 25:18.250
will feel your auspiciousness.

25:19.208 --> 25:26.166
But, again, you must give due respect

25:26.417 --> 25:29.709
to your Self Realization and to your Self.

25:29.999 --> 25:33.917
That is the first thing you have to do, is to meditate.

25:34.166 --> 25:38.125
Somebody sent Me a letter and I saw the vibrations were horrid.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.792
I said, "What's the matter with this gentleman?

25:41.041 --> 25:44.999
His vibrations are so horrid, what is he doing?"

25:45.250 --> 25:48.834
Then I found out that he says he doesn't need any meditation.

25:49.083 --> 25:53.583
He has already reached the fourteenth heaven,

25:53.875 --> 25:57.750
so he doesn't need any meditation, doesn't have to do any meditation.

25:59.208 --> 26:03.959
Is easy to explain, but whom are you explaining?

26:04.250 --> 26:07.834
You have to explain to yourself,

26:08.083 --> 26:12.375
only yourself, nobody else wants your explanation.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.709
It's like missing the plane.

26:14.917 --> 26:16.250
When you miss the plane

26:16.500 --> 26:21.250
whom are you going to explain, the plane has left.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.208
So then you have to explain yourself only.

26:25.458 --> 26:31.000
You will tell the air, or to the gangway,

26:31.250 --> 26:33.999
or anything that, "Oh baba, it happened like that,

26:34.166 --> 26:37.709
there was this thing, I had no time, there was a jam, this, that."

26:37.999 --> 26:41.333
But the plane is gone.

26:41.917 --> 26:45.583
Whom are you explaining?

26:48.999 --> 26:55.458
So everyone should meditate every day.

26:55.750 --> 26:58.250
That is a very important thing,

26:58.500 --> 27:05.208
which people are doing in all the countries where I am not.

27:05.542 --> 27:09.709
Because I am in England, people take Me for granted.

27:09.959 --> 27:11.999
"Mother is doing everything."

27:12.250 --> 27:16.999
So I get up at 4 o'clock, take My bath, meditate for you all.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.542
I better start doing that again.

27:19.834 --> 27:21.458
Otherwise you have no time to meditate.

27:21.667 --> 27:25.000
So at least let Me meditate for your sake.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.792
So everyone must today promise to Me

27:27.999 --> 27:32.083
that they will meditate every day.

27:32.375 --> 27:35.333
Get up in the morning!

27:36.999 --> 27:38.083
"We can't get up in the morning."

27:38.291 --> 27:41.999
The whole world can get up, why not the English?

27:42.250 --> 27:45.041
But when it was the war of Waterloo,

27:45.250 --> 27:47.917
they were the first to arrive there.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.166
They won the war because they were so punctual.

27:52.417 --> 27:56.291
What has happened to their punctuality today?

28:03.625 --> 28:07.959
We are not drinking, we do not have hangovers,

28:08.166 --> 28:11.583
we don't sleep late,

28:11.875 --> 28:14.208
so why shouldn't we decide today

28:14.458 --> 28:19.250
that, "Every morning I'll get up and do my meditation.

28:19.542 --> 28:25.250
And while meditating I must concentrate on myself and not on others.

28:26.250 --> 28:28.166
And see for myself what is catching,

28:28.375 --> 28:30.375
where am I catching, which chakra I am catching,

28:30.625 --> 28:32.834
what have I to do?"

28:33.083 --> 28:35.500
So on this day of Navaratri,

28:35.792 --> 28:38.667
today as the first day,

28:38.999 --> 28:45.542
the Gauri's power must be enlightened within us, and they must express.

28:45.750 --> 28:51.291
And they are tremendous. I cannot describe them in one lecture.

28:51.999 --> 28:55.750
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.458
She acts in the Mother Earth,

28:57.667 --> 28:59.999
She acts in the universe,

29:00.291 --> 29:02.792
She acts in the animals,

29:02.999 --> 29:06.125
She acts in the matter,

29:06.333 --> 29:08.792
She acts in the human beings,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.917
and now She acts in you.

29:15.792 --> 29:19.041
She is the One who decides

29:19.250 --> 29:22.750
the face and the figure that you are going to have.

29:22.999 --> 29:26.709
She is the One who decides what child you should have.

29:26.959 --> 29:27.917
She is the One

29:28.083 --> 29:33.000
who gives you the particular type of a child that you need.

29:33.291 --> 29:37.917
She is the One who has got you all these beautiful children.

29:38.166 --> 29:38.999
She is the One

29:39.250 --> 29:43.542
who has given you these sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

29:43.834 --> 29:46.625
All this She has done for you,

29:46.917 --> 29:51.625
but what about the Power that you have within yourself.

29:51.917 --> 29:54.583
How much have you manifested that?

29:54.875 --> 29:57.625
The Primordial is working very hard, no doubt.

29:57.917 --> 30:00.125
But what about you, the individuals,

30:00.417 --> 30:03.083
who have got their own Kundalini awakened?

30:03.375 --> 30:07.000
How far you have opened Her out.

30:07.375 --> 30:10.500
And what is Kundalini, is a simple thing as you know.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.500
Is the true desire.

30:13.709 --> 30:16.667
So true desire to perfect yourself, to grow yourself.

30:16.875 --> 30:21.875
If it is really true desire, nothing else is important.

30:26.959 --> 30:30.875
All other desires are secondary and tertiary.

30:31.125 --> 30:34.375
The most important desire is to grow.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.375
And for whose advantage ? Is the advantage of yours

30:38.625 --> 30:43.041
and in your advantage only, the advantage of the whole world rests.

30:43.291 --> 30:48.750
Sahaja Yogis today represent the growth of this universe,

30:48.999 --> 30:52.750
the growth of the human race.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.792
Do you follow this point

30:54.999 --> 30:58.999
that you are playing such an important role,

30:59.250 --> 31:03.166
role at such a crucial time

31:03.458 --> 31:07.750
when the world is about to collapse?

31:11.542 --> 31:15.917
And you have great seers like William Blake,

31:16.166 --> 31:20.999
you had such great people who have talked about this time.

31:21.250 --> 31:25.250
They have built it up, traditionally we have built up all this -

31:25.500 --> 31:29.125
now, in England.

31:32.250 --> 31:37.500
The work of ages that has brought this England to gestate...

31:37.792 --> 31:43.083
Now, do you realize

31:43.375 --> 31:49.667
that the position of English Sahaja Yogis is very important.

31:54.208 --> 32:00.583
But lack of wisdom and bumptiousness

32:00.917 --> 32:06.667
without understanding your Self,

32:06.917 --> 32:11.959
how can you talk so loud?

32:12.166 --> 32:17.375
How can you think of organizing everything

32:17.667 --> 32:23.417
when you yourself are so weak, so bumptious?

32:25.583 --> 32:30.208
So today I am not going to take the count of the people,

32:30.458 --> 32:33.917
who meditate every day or not.

32:34.166 --> 32:35.417
But I can tell you this much,

32:35.625 --> 32:39.959
next year those who do not meditate everyday,

32:40.208 --> 32:42.875
you will not be here anymore.

32:43.125 --> 32:46.166
Take it from Me.

32:46.999 --> 32:50.083
Is a fact.

32:50.667 --> 32:55.417
Every day you must meditate.

32:55.750 --> 32:57.667
Discipline yourself.

32:57.875 --> 33:02.999
Now you have come to a new perspection, perspective.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.959
You have come to a new vision.

33:05.208 --> 33:10.208
Now when you see that vision, when you know the vision,

33:10.500 --> 33:13.375
you cannot just stand there.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.709
Get into it!

33:25.000 --> 33:30.583
Everyone says, Damle was saying too, everybody says

33:30.834 --> 33:35.999
that, "Mother you have spent so much time for these English.

33:36.542 --> 33:39.583
Why so much time for them?"

33:47.375 --> 33:51.500
Maybe you might be thinking that because you are very great,

33:51.709 --> 33:54.500
that's why I have to serve you people.

33:54.750 --> 33:57.999
Think the way you like.

33:59.208 --> 34:04.375
But the most important thing is that you are on the land of Heart,

34:04.667 --> 34:09.458
and I have to cleanse you more, much more than others.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.709
But it's just the other way round. Others are going so fast.

34:13.999 --> 34:18.917
I am amazed, their vibrations, their sensitivity, their understanding.

34:19.083 --> 34:24.417
And they have just mastered it; every one of them.

34:26.083 --> 34:31.375
Here, it is becoming a very centralized stuff

34:31.583 --> 34:34.375
and everybody doesn't want to understand Sahaja Yoga,

34:34.625 --> 34:38.458
but everyone wants to give a lecture.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.500
There is no respect for elders.

34:45.917 --> 34:50.125
No respect who is older who is younger,

34:50.417 --> 34:51.999
and somebody who thinks that

34:52.208 --> 34:55.542
because they got Realization before others they are higher,

34:55.792 --> 35:02.250
then remember one word of Christ, that, "First will be the last."

35:04.500 --> 35:09.917
So try to understand that it is you who has to grow,

35:10.166 --> 35:14.375
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

35:14.583 --> 35:16.166
Manifestation of the power,

35:16.417 --> 35:20.250
I don't know how far you have understood.

35:20.917 --> 35:23.959
When a person who has Gauri's power,

35:24.208 --> 35:26.834
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

35:27.041 --> 35:32.041
everybody's Kundalini rises, just to salute.

35:40.792 --> 35:43.250
When you have Gauri's power

35:43.542 --> 35:48.959
then you stand out because you have that innocent,

35:49.166 --> 35:54.667
lustless, greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

35:54.959 --> 35:56.500
and wherever you turn your eyes,

35:56.792 --> 36:02.542
even one glance would raise the Kundalini, immediately.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.458
People who suffer from cancer, suffer from this disease, that disease,

36:07.750 --> 36:09.625
all can be cured in no time

36:09.834 --> 36:14.625
if you have developed only one power of Gauri.

36:18.625 --> 36:21.999
All your problems can be solved.

36:22.250 --> 36:24.542
Negativity will go away

36:24.792 --> 36:29.625
and you will become like a lotus.

36:30.792 --> 36:35.083
Beautiful, fragrant,

36:37.291 --> 36:39.917
overpowering all kinds of negativity.

36:40.083 --> 36:45.083
Here it is, "That fellow just touched me

36:45.375 --> 36:48.917
and now I have become egoistical."

36:49.542 --> 36:52.041
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

36:52.333 --> 36:55.500
he just talks to another person, the person goes egoistical.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.291
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

36:58.500 --> 37:03.041
You have to be sensitive to God and not to bad things.

37:03.333 --> 37:10.375
But we are more akin, more vulnerable to bad than to good.

37:12.750 --> 37:17.917
So the power, the power of assimilation of good,

37:18.166 --> 37:22.917
the power of emission of good,

37:23.125 --> 37:29.375
all these powers are just in your complete reach.

37:30.583 --> 37:35.709
But all this should not become a praise

37:35.959 --> 37:38.583
but should become a kind of a challenge,

37:38.834 --> 37:44.083
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

37:44.375 --> 37:47.792
and an advancement for you.

37:48.166 --> 37:51.709
But we are going down, I must tell you,

37:51.917 --> 37:54.792
we are going down in England.

37:55.041 --> 37:57.417
Because we have some funny tags,

37:57.709 --> 38:01.792
funny people who are all the time with tags.

38:02.041 --> 38:05.542
Such people will have to be warned,

38:05.834 --> 38:10.792
and later on may be declared, as these people have decided,

38:11.041 --> 38:14.750
should be declared as blacklisted.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.333
It's a very sad day today for Me

38:20.542 --> 38:22.542
and that is why the whole place is filled with -

38:22.750 --> 38:24.917
I mean I had no mind to have the puja here,

38:25.125 --> 38:26.375
because I am really very sad.

38:26.583 --> 38:30.166
Because when I see the vibrations, when I see the way things are,

38:30.417 --> 38:33.208
people are just in a picnic way in England,

38:33.500 --> 38:36.959
I feel so unhappy, you don't know.

38:40.583 --> 38:47.583
I have always been extremely enamored,

38:49.166 --> 38:53.999
and I have already put up a big show of appreciating your efforts.

38:54.291 --> 38:59.375
But if you see in the substance of it;

39:00.750 --> 39:04.041
just see the substance, you watch within yourself.

39:04.250 --> 39:09.083
Each individual should see the substance that is within us.

39:09.375 --> 39:12.125
We are worried about a friend,

39:12.417 --> 39:17.999
a fiancèe or a wife or a husband or this and that.

39:18.291 --> 39:21.625
That's not the caliber.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.959
The caliber is very low and is going down lower.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.750
That's not a good thing, is not good.

39:32.959 --> 39:37.667
If My love and compassion is spoiling you, I better pull you out of it.

39:37.959 --> 39:40.917
Because you are capable

39:41.125 --> 39:43.667
of your merits to be born in this country.

39:43.875 --> 39:46.625
You are capable of very great heights.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.625
I know that.

39:50.125 --> 39:53.083
Of very great heights, which you can achieve.

39:53.291 --> 39:56.834
But not by talking about it or thinking about it,

39:57.000 --> 40:02.542
but by becoming that great power,

40:03.750 --> 40:06.709
to become that power.

40:06.959 --> 40:09.041
And see the collective blessings people have

40:09.291 --> 40:12.667
and I was amazed when they told Me, they have got this blessing,

40:12.875 --> 40:14.250
they have got that blessing.

40:14.458 --> 40:19.083
I mean unlimited blessings they have got.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.834
And why can't we have that here?

40:24.083 --> 40:27.458
What's the problem with us?

40:28.291 --> 40:32.500
If we are not collective, if there is a problem between ourselves,

40:32.792 --> 40:36.125
that means there is some sort of an ego still in-between

40:36.333 --> 40:39.583
that is keeping us out.

40:42.041 --> 40:47.542
So let us now, promise within our heart

40:47.834 --> 40:50.583
that this has to go into our heart,

40:50.875 --> 40:56.375
a very deep feeling for ourselves,

40:56.709 --> 41:00.083
that by God's grace we are born at such a juncture

41:00.375 --> 41:03.208
when this thing has happened,

41:03.542 --> 41:06.834
that we are the people who are beneficiaries

41:07.083 --> 41:10.917
of the blessings of God that we have got our Realization,

41:11.208 --> 41:14.166
that we have risen so high.

41:14.458 --> 41:19.792
But now let us spread our wings, but we are cutting them down.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.999
Don't become small-minded people,

41:22.166 --> 41:24.667
worried about small, small things here and there.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.917
Nothing is important.

41:28.333 --> 41:31.208
If you see in your previous lives, you have had all kinds of foods,

41:31.417 --> 41:32.999
you have had all kinds of trips,

41:33.166 --> 41:37.917
you have done every kind of marriages, you have done every kind of

41:38.125 --> 41:42.041
other nonsensical thing that people waste time with.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.542
It's over now, finished. Now you do something new.

41:45.792 --> 41:49.333
How many people you have married in previous lives

41:49.583 --> 41:52.750
and how many houses you had in previous lives

41:52.999 --> 41:56.375
and how many pleasures you have had,

41:56.667 --> 41:59.792
finished now - finish it.

42:03.917 --> 42:07.917
This is a special time, the best time of Ritambhara

42:08.125 --> 42:12.250
where you have to grow. That's the point is, the season is that.

42:12.583 --> 42:16.208
In this season if you do not grow,

42:16.667 --> 42:19.417
you won't grow.

42:19.709 --> 42:23.458
You have to take full advantage.

42:23.875 --> 42:27.166
With full intensity

42:27.458 --> 42:29.999
you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

42:30.291 --> 42:32.375
That doesn't mean that you give up your jobs, or anything.

42:32.583 --> 42:35.999
If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga, you will be intense in everything.

42:36.208 --> 42:38.875
But there is no intensity.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.667
Munich I decided just,

42:40.959 --> 42:43.583
I don't know if Warren has told you - Munich

42:43.875 --> 42:45.375
"You didn't tell them about Munich?"

42:45.709 --> 42:48.750
All right - Munich. I decided last minute,

42:48.999 --> 42:50.041
because there was a horrid one

42:50.250 --> 42:52.500
who had come from Munich and had told Me

42:52.709 --> 42:56.875
that Munich's seekers will ask such questions.

42:57.166 --> 42:58.834
I didn't like them at all. She was very arrogant.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.500
I said I am not going to Munich.

43:00.750 --> 43:05.041
But in Vienna I just felt the vibrations of Munich.

43:05.333 --> 43:09.000
And I was amazed. I said, "All right, I am going to Munich."

43:09.291 --> 43:11.166
We had to run up and down to get My visa,

43:11.375 --> 43:15.417
this thing. Everything worked out, as usual.

43:15.792 --> 43:19.125
And in that short time, three days,

43:19.375 --> 43:21.458
four hundred people were there.

43:21.750 --> 43:27.250
And so intense, I tell you, so intense, even children, so intense,

43:27.542 --> 43:31.542
and they were listening to every word I was saying,

43:31.792 --> 43:34.667
and picking up as pearls,

43:34.917 --> 43:37.250
precious as diamonds,

43:37.458 --> 43:41.208
every word they were noting it down.

43:41.500 --> 43:45.083
And when they had their Realization they were just stunned people.

43:45.375 --> 43:49.041
Imagine the Germans, coming over you people, English.

43:49.250 --> 43:52.291
What will happen to you?

43:53.500 --> 43:55.792
They are people of determination.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.291
If they decide to do good, they'll do lot of good.

44:00.542 --> 44:03.333
They are not like this.

44:03.625 --> 44:05.750
And then when I left them,

44:05.999 --> 44:09.750
for one hour they were in the hall, just stunned,

44:10.041 --> 44:13.208
discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

44:17.667 --> 44:20.417
But here as soon as I go away,

44:20.625 --> 44:23.125
people start discussing something so nonsensical.

44:23.417 --> 44:26.917
I hear it. I know the vibrations and everything.

44:27.125 --> 44:31.417
We are not intense, we must increase our intensity.

44:31.667 --> 44:35.333
That is what is called as Shraddha.

44:37.125 --> 44:41.417
Is important, very important.

44:42.999 --> 44:49.083
And I am sure this year you will make it a point

44:49.417 --> 44:54.625
to do intense understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

44:55.959 --> 44:59.041
That intensity is lacking.

44:59.458 --> 45:03.625
May be there is something gone wrong with you in the past

45:03.917 --> 45:07.458
and you are conditioned about it, or you think about it.

45:07.750 --> 45:11.166
How can I do it, it is too much.

45:11.417 --> 45:16.417
You can do it, everything, you forget the past, forget the past.

45:16.709 --> 45:21.166
Past has no meaning whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga.

45:23.999 --> 45:26.750
You are being completely renovated

45:27.000 --> 45:30.542
but just use your mechanism.

45:30.834 --> 45:32.375
I have worked so hard with you people

45:32.583 --> 45:34.875
that nothing wrong with your mechanism.

45:35.125 --> 45:38.999
Only thing you have no faith in yourself.

45:39.625 --> 45:41.291
And those who do not have faith in themselves

45:41.500 --> 45:44.625
are always bumptious people.

45:45.333 --> 45:50.500
So first of all station yourself within your Spirit,

45:50.750 --> 45:56.333
within your heart and try to develop your powers,

45:56.625 --> 45:59.542
inner powers, not of talking and showing off,

45:59.750 --> 46:02.792
but inner powers.

46:07.834 --> 46:11.709
Still so many are possessed, you know that.

46:11.999 --> 46:14.583
It's a shameful thing

46:14.792 --> 46:18.250
that even now in the temple of God there are people

46:18.542 --> 46:23.125
who are possessed by horrible evil things.

46:23.375 --> 46:26.125
How can it be?

46:26.500 --> 46:32.208
You are the carrier of all these, even now, how can it be?

46:36.458 --> 46:39.709
So one has to be very intensely there,

46:39.999 --> 46:42.375
and those today who are looking to be nothing,

46:42.583 --> 46:44.917
will grow into something so great,

46:45.083 --> 46:47.750
that you will be amazed at yourself.

46:47.999 --> 46:51.625
"How is it I have become so great?"

46:51.959 --> 46:56.709
But the first and foremost thing is disciplining.

46:58.333 --> 47:01.083
Discipline yourself.

47:01.333 --> 47:03.792
When it comes to eating, some people eat too much.

47:04.041 --> 47:06.917
When it comes to talking, some people talk too much.

47:07.125 --> 47:10.750
Or they do not talk at all, or they eat not at all.

47:10.999 --> 47:13.125
All this is indiscipline.

47:13.417 --> 47:16.542
But going higher to this spiritual life,

47:16.834 --> 47:19.542
best thing is to take the discipline from your Spirit

47:19.750 --> 47:21.750
and you are disciplined automatically.

47:21.999 --> 47:25.458
Let the Spirit rule you.

47:27.250 --> 47:30.166
It's possible. It's possible,

47:30.500 --> 47:32.667
because I have seen in such a short time

47:32.917 --> 47:37.208
and when I have been there for such a short time,

47:37.458 --> 47:39.625
I don't even know their names.

47:39.917 --> 47:41.999
Here practically I know all of you,

47:42.208 --> 47:46.291
by your names, and by your vibrations also.

47:46.625 --> 47:50.166
And they have gone up so much.

47:51.166 --> 47:53.500
So, today is a great day.

47:53.792 --> 47:56.125
Of course a great privilege.

47:56.417 --> 48:01.792
Always you are privileged people, like House of Lords.

48:02.250 --> 48:04.041
Is true, but may be,

48:04.333 --> 48:09.250
one day may come when this House of Lords may be banished completely.

48:09.542 --> 48:12.917
You have to behave like lords.

48:15.583 --> 48:19.041
That is why My humble request is

48:19.291 --> 48:22.500
that you must learn

48:22.750 --> 48:25.999
to worship discipline.

48:26.333 --> 48:28.333
I don't say, "Do this, do that."

48:28.625 --> 48:30.875
You know what is to be done.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.999
And then on top of that, you should not tell Me,

48:33.166 --> 48:36.166
"I know, I should have, I know."

48:36.417 --> 48:41.291
When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered.

48:41.583 --> 48:46.041
Today let us, with full confidence in ourselves

48:46.333 --> 48:48.000
and in our ascent,

48:48.291 --> 48:51.834
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

48:52.083 --> 48:53.959
and in our hearts decide

48:54.208 --> 48:57.917
that, "I am going to discipline myself."

49:01.834 --> 49:05.583
May God bless you.

49:19.208 --> 49:23.250
Navaratri is beginning with a big force.

49:25.583 --> 49:28.583
But vibration-wise is good,

49:30.458 --> 49:32.667
Vibrations are very strong today.

49:32.875 --> 49:33.999
Tremendous.

49:34.166 --> 49:37.333
And you take full advantage of them.

49:37.917 --> 49:40.709
If you want, you can use your left hand or right hand,

49:40.959 --> 49:43.375
whichever way you like.

49:44.375 --> 49:46.583
If you wish put your left hand towards Mother

49:46.792 --> 49:53.792
and right hand on the earth. Or, left hand...

49:54.041 --> 49:58.417
I would say it is left hand, mostly.

49:59.875 --> 50:02.250
Even those who look egoistical are

50:02.458 --> 50:05.458
under the power of some sort of a possession.

50:05.667 --> 50:09.625
And they are even worse than people who are really egoistical

50:09.917 --> 50:13.333
because they are themselves not aware at all

50:13.458 --> 50:16.542
what they are talking about.
