WEBVTT

00:32.760 --> 00:38.640
Today we are going to have the Puja of Shri Krishna.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.160
In Shri Krishna’s life,

00:52.440 --> 00:58.160
the River Yamuna has played a very great role.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.800
The Yamuna River is a very deep river

01:04.040 --> 01:07.160
and the water has a blue color,

01:07.360 --> 01:11.120
which they say Shri Krishna also had,

01:15.680 --> 01:20.680
while the River Ganges flows faster

01:20.960 --> 01:24.960
and much shallower than this river.

01:26.280 --> 01:29.200
Next year maybe we might go to Allahabad,

01:29.400 --> 01:34.240
might be able to see the two rivers meet.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.760
The whole of Haryana

01:41.040 --> 01:45.560
has been a very, very historical, mythological place.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.320
You must have known about it

01:48.520 --> 01:54.520
that Pandavas and Kauravas fought in Kurukshetra

01:54.760 --> 01:59.440
and also all this area has been

01:59.640 --> 02:04.920
used since long for meditation.

02:05.160 --> 02:09.160
Markandeya, whose name you have heard many a times,

02:09.360 --> 02:12.640
meditated in this area.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.760
First, he was in Maharashtra,

02:15.960 --> 02:18.640
where you have seen the Sapta Shringhi.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.880
And after that, he came down here and meditated

02:24.120 --> 02:28.160
and wrote his treatise.

02:28.760 --> 02:33.120
Everywhere you find a place of a pir.

02:33.360 --> 02:40.200
Also they are realized souls who have been respected till today.

02:41.240 --> 02:47.600
To begin with, we have to say that this is the

02:49.120 --> 02:53.480
area of great spirituality,

02:53.720 --> 02:57.480
because Shri Krishna lived here.

02:57.720 --> 03:02.760
And, in those days there were no cars,

03:02.960 --> 03:04.760
not this transport.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.360
So he has vibrated all this land so beautifully.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.800
Very fond of playing near the River Yamuna.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.760
Of course, his childhood was not spent here.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.080
But later on when he became the king

03:21.280 --> 03:25.720
he used to visit this place many a times.

03:29.880 --> 03:35.200
We have to understand his character in a very special way.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.440
First, we had the incarnation of Shri Rama.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.040
The Vishnu, as you know, took the birth of

03:47.280 --> 03:48.920
Shri Rama.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.520
But Shri Rama forgot his divinity.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.280
He was made to forget his divinity,

03:56.480 --> 04:01.040
and he lived like an ordinary person,

04:02.240 --> 04:05.880
became a king

04:06.080 --> 04:10.560
like Socrates has described, the benevolent king.

04:10.840 --> 04:16.280
And he had to also sacrifice his wife.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.960
That’s very symbolic, no doubt.

04:22.200 --> 04:28.280
The other part of north India we’ll be able to see his

04:29.360 --> 04:32.920
vibrated areas where he moved.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.680
But Maharashtra he went without shoes,

04:37.880 --> 04:41.280
walked and walked and walked.

04:41.480 --> 04:47.520
Thus, this whole country is really vibrated by great saints

04:47.720 --> 04:52.320
and by great incarnations.

04:56.560 --> 05:02.840
Shri Krishna’s one side was that he was like a child,

05:03.520 --> 05:08.080
and he wanted to

05:08.280 --> 05:13.320
create an atmosphere of mirth, of joy,

05:13.600 --> 05:17.160
because at the time of Shri Rama,

05:17.360 --> 05:21.720
after him the religion was taken very seriously

05:21.960 --> 05:28.440
and people started doing very serious type of religion.

05:29.920 --> 05:36.440
The same incarnation again reappeared, Shri Krishna.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.400
And Shri Krishna wanted to show that

05:41.680 --> 05:48.160
spirituality is not serious; it’s “Leela”.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.920
It’s a game that you have to play.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.600
And in his lifetime he showed.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.080
People don’t understand him at all,

05:58.280 --> 06:03.280
because from Shri Rama’s concept he cannot condescend,

06:03.480 --> 06:07.200
to come down to the, sometimes,

06:07.400 --> 06:13.680
to the level of Shri Krishna which was, I think, was much higher.

06:14.200 --> 06:18.960
Because he had to show that all this,

06:19.160 --> 06:23.840
all this world, is just a joke, is Maya,

06:24.040 --> 06:28.360
and beyond that is joy.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.320
His whole style was very interesting.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.760
That time they couldn’t have such beautiful pendals,

06:37.040 --> 06:40.080
they couldn’t have so many disciples,

06:40.280 --> 06:43.560
so he tried on his own style.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.920
And his style was, when he was a child,

06:47.600 --> 06:52.560
there were many milk maid whom they called “gopis”.

06:52.760 --> 06:58.480
They would be taking their bath in the River Yamuna, not here.

06:59.120 --> 07:05.640
He would just break their water pitcher

07:06.000 --> 07:09.640
and the water would flow on their back.

07:09.880 --> 07:14.840
This Yamuna River was vibrated by Radhaji.

07:15.040 --> 07:18.680
Radha: “Ra” means energy; “Dha” means the one who sustains.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.360
Radha - Dhara iti sada - Radha.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.960
And he

07:26.760 --> 07:29.800
didn’t know how to tell them about Kundalini.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.200
So he used to throw stones, small stones,

07:35.400 --> 07:41.360
at those pitchers and the water would flow down their backbone,

07:41.600 --> 07:47.040
thus giving them the blessings of the Kundalini.

07:50.280 --> 07:54.040
His style was extremely, extremely

07:54.240 --> 07:57.120
simple, playful, mirthful,

07:57.320 --> 08:02.200
and nobody understood why he was doing all these things.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.520
Also, when he was a very small child,

08:05.720 --> 08:08.040
there were ladies who were taking their baths.

08:08.240 --> 08:13.680
So he was trying to raise their Kundalini and he hid their clothes;

08:13.880 --> 08:15.760
he vibrated them.

08:15.960 --> 08:22.120
So, many people don’t understand a little child; he’s so innocent.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.360
And he was teasing them, and tried to show

08:26.560 --> 08:29.480
that life is nothing but joy.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.880
And he then he gave them those clothes.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
Later on, he grew up.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.040
Then he became the king of Dwarika.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.280
In our country there are very westernized intellectuals,

08:54.480 --> 08:58.320
and they try to say that there were two Shri Krishnas.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.440
I mean, they want to analyze everything

09:00.640 --> 09:02.880
without understanding spirituality,

09:03.080 --> 09:06.960
what is the subtle thing behind it.

09:07.840 --> 09:13.040
There was, he had sixteen thousand wives, as they say.

09:13.480 --> 09:19.240
They were his powers. You see, for men - I am a Mother.

09:19.440 --> 09:23.960
I can have thousands of children: boys, girls, men, women.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.320
Nobody can say anything about my character.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.840
But for men it is very difficult.

09:31.040 --> 09:35.040
So he got all his powers born as women

09:35.320 --> 09:37.360
who were married to some king.

09:37.560 --> 09:42.000
Not married; actually he had abducted those women

09:42.200 --> 09:44.280
and put them in jail.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.320
So he saved them from there,

09:47.520 --> 09:51.840
brought them out, and married them.

09:52.040 --> 09:58.200
Now the, if you see the accent is on marriage.

09:59.480 --> 10:03.440
He married these women with sixteen thousand powers.

10:03.640 --> 10:08.160
As you know, he is sixteen petals and one thousand

10:08.360 --> 10:13.920
of the Sahasrara is sixteen thousand powers which he married.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.720
Then he had five wives, for which also people have objections.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.280
Only Krishna can do like that.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.520
Five wives are the five elements.

10:23.720 --> 10:28.080
The essence of them, the essence of them, the causal of them,

10:28.280 --> 10:33.320
came as his wives and he married them.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.160
But he was such a detached soul.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.960
There’s lot of stories about his detachment.

10:44.400 --> 10:50.080
There was one great rishi,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.480
meaning a saint or sage,

10:52.680 --> 10:55.720
who had arrived on the other side of the River Yamuna.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.160
This was in Dwarika.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.560
And, there was no Yamuna River,

11:00.760 --> 11:06.680
but there was also, there was Narmada and Tapti,

11:07.040 --> 11:11.480
and they wanted to go and serve the sage.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.000
So when they went near the river,

11:14.200 --> 11:17.400
they found the river was all flooded.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.800
So they went back to Shri Krishna and said,

11:20.040 --> 11:23.080
“See, we are going to worship the sage

11:23.280 --> 11:27.040
and the river is all flooded.”

11:30.440 --> 11:33.960
So he said, “All right, you go and tell the river a truth.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.800
By that truth it will go down.”

11:36.000 --> 11:37.480
“What’s the truth?”

11:37.680 --> 11:42.680
“That Shri Krishna is a Brahmacharya, is a celibate person.”

11:42.920 --> 11:45.800
He had five wives.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.440
They said, “How can we say this?”

11:47.640 --> 11:50.880
"This is the truth” he said. “You go and tell him. Tell the river,

11:51.080 --> 11:52.800
and river will understand the truth.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.560
The power of truth will put down the floods.”

11:56.800 --> 12:02.640
So they went and they said that, “Shri Krishna is a Brahmacharya,”

12:02.840 --> 12:06.320
and the river went down.  And they were surprised.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.360
“How it can happen? This fellow is our husband,

12:09.560 --> 12:14.520
and how can he say that he is a Brahmacharya?”

12:15.120 --> 12:19.080
So they served the sage, served him well,

12:19.280 --> 12:22.760
gave him food,

12:23.280 --> 12:26.320
looked after him, and

12:26.600 --> 12:31.840
when they came back they again saw the river was again in floods.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.920
So they were quite worried how to cross the river now.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.560
So then went back to the sage and informed the sage

12:40.760 --> 12:44.520
that, “See, we have to go back and there the river is

12:44.720 --> 12:49.800
in speed and we don’t know how to cross over.”

12:50.000 --> 12:55.280
He said, “It’s very easy. If you want to go, it’s very easy.”

12:55.480 --> 12:58.480
They said, “How?”

12:58.680 --> 13:00.000
“How did you come?”

13:00.200 --> 13:03.920
They said, “We told, Krishna told us like this to tell

13:04.120 --> 13:07.520
that the river is celibate,

13:07.720 --> 13:10.760
that, that, ‘I am celibate. I am celibate.

13:10.960 --> 13:15.280
And the river, she’s also – Narmada is also a celibate river.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.280
So the river went down.”

13:20.040 --> 13:23.680
“All right, then you go and tell the river now

13:23.920 --> 13:28.440
that I didn’t eat any food. Nothing I ate.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.560
I am just fasting.”

13:30.800 --> 13:33.240
They said, “This fellow ate like a glutton,

13:33.440 --> 13:35.800
and telling us a lie like this,

13:36.000 --> 13:40.480
and how are we to believe this man?”

13:40.680 --> 13:46.880
So, they went to the river and to the river they said that,

13:47.080 --> 13:51.480
“This sage didn’t eat any food - he is on a fast -

13:51.680 --> 13:56.240
and please go down.” And the river went down.

13:56.440 --> 14:00.160
So they were surprised, how this fellow has eaten everything

14:00.360 --> 14:03.120
and despite that, when we told it, it’s a big lie.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.480
This river has listened to this lie.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.120
So they crossed over.

14:11.320 --> 14:17.280
The point is, those people who are at that level,

14:17.480 --> 14:22.280
even when they eat they don’t eat.

14:23.240 --> 14:28.160
Even they are married, they are celibate. It’s a state.

14:28.360 --> 14:32.680
It’s a state in which you are completely detached,

14:33.200 --> 14:34.880
absolutely detached.

14:35.080 --> 14:41.000
You don’t feel the attachment of the work you are doing,

14:41.200 --> 14:44.600
or the life you are leading.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.320
I cannot say how one should become detached.

14:48.520 --> 14:52.360
Of course, with the Kundalini working out and

14:52.560 --> 14:55.080
you meditating, all that, and

14:55.280 --> 14:57.840
fixing the Kundalini properly, it will work out.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.360
You will be amazed how you will become detached about things

15:02.600 --> 15:06.480
and how you can manage

15:07.480 --> 15:09.920
things without feeling that you are doing it,

15:10.120 --> 15:16.040
how you can work out so many things without feeling even tired.

15:16.240 --> 15:21.360
It’s, it's a state. And that is the state one has to achieve.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.080
Now for that, whether you are at that stage or not,

15:26.280 --> 15:28.240
first thing you must notice how many times

15:28.440 --> 15:33.760
I use the word, “‘I”, “me”.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.280
How many times I said,

15:35.480 --> 15:41.360
“I saw this, I enjoyed this, I this, I that?”

15:41.880 --> 15:47.840
Or, “This is my child. This is my house,” something like that.

15:50.040 --> 15:54.960
When you start using “I” too much,

15:55.160 --> 15:59.000
then you are not detached.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.920
Try to introspect. How many times I say,

16:04.120 --> 16:08.600
“I have got this.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.520
work to be done I’ve got to do this.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.840
I must furnish this. I must achieve this.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.960
This is the goal of my life.”?

16:19.160 --> 16:23.920
These are all words of illusion.

16:24.120 --> 16:29.840
Once you get detached, it’s a state, again I say. I won’t say that,

16:30.040 --> 16:32.120
“By standing on your head you will become detached,”

16:32.320 --> 16:37.000
or anything like that. It’s a state into which one has to grow.

16:37.200 --> 16:42.280
So Shri Krishna’s message, all his life, was complete detachment.

16:42.480 --> 16:49.120
Even when he went with Arjuna for a war,

16:49.360 --> 16:53.960
he said, “I will be just the driver of your chariot.

16:54.160 --> 16:59.880
But I will not raise any weapons. I will not fight.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.600
I will be just your charioteer,

17:04.800 --> 17:10.000
and if you agree to that condition, I’ll be there.”

17:10.880 --> 17:16.440
Actually, when Arjuna had a question,

17:16.640 --> 17:20.040
“How can I kill? These are my relations, these are my gurus,

17:20.240 --> 17:25.320
these are my, my close people, my friends.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.120
How can I kill them?”

17:28.320 --> 17:31.840
And he became very depressed.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.200
When he became depressed, Krishna said,

17:35.400 --> 17:38.800
that “Do you know they are already dead?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.600
Anything that is born has to die.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.880
So, you have to kill them.”

17:47.120 --> 17:50.520
Now people can say that Krishna was preaching violence.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.520
No, not that.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.360
But what he said at those people

17:55.560 --> 17:57.160
who are adharmies [GW: adharmics?],

17:57.360 --> 18:01.080
who have no sense of dharma, who have been so cruel,

18:01.280 --> 18:07.600
who have been very much against the tradition of dharma,

18:08.200 --> 18:11.040
they have to be killed.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.960
Whether you kill them or not, they are already dead

18:14.160 --> 18:17.400
because they have committed so many sins.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.880
They are already dead.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.440
So you should not think that you are killing,

18:22.640 --> 18:26.720
but it’s a Divine

18:26.920 --> 18:30.920
which is going to kill them, so-called killing.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.600
And so the war started.

18:33.800 --> 18:39.160
In the Gita also people have very less understanding

18:39.360 --> 18:43.440
as to what he wanted to communicate.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.320
The first thing, I mean the war is on

18:46.520 --> 18:52.240
and he’s talking about philosophy, you can imagine the detachment.

18:55.920 --> 19:02.120
The first thing he told him that, “You should take to Gyana.”

19:02.400 --> 19:05.880
“Gyana” means “bodh”.

19:06.320 --> 19:13.000
Bodh, as you know, is only possible through enlightenment.

19:13.520 --> 19:18.600
So he said, “You should take to Gyana, to bodh,

19:18.800 --> 19:21.520
which is enlightenment.”

19:21.720 --> 19:23.320
But people don’t understand Gyana.

19:23.520 --> 19:27.120
They think that by reading books, by reading all kinds of,

19:27.320 --> 19:31.080
there are so many criticisms of Gita reading all that,

19:31.280 --> 19:35.320
or understanding about Gita.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.960
There are many in this country

19:37.160 --> 19:39.320
who are giving lectures on Shri Krishna;

19:39.520 --> 19:43.720
in their own lives they are horrible.

19:44.320 --> 19:48.120
So, the first thing he told,,

19:48.320 --> 19:53.520
the best thing to be done that is the only thing to be done.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.960
He was a, not a businessman.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.760
A businessman will tell you first something that is not so good,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.560
then better, better, better raising you slowly.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.400
But he said, outright,

20:07.600 --> 20:10.160
that that is the point by which you become Stitapragya,

20:10.360 --> 20:15.080
means Sahaja yogi. He said clearly.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.640
But Arjuna said then, “If it is so,

20:17.840 --> 20:23.360
why do you want me to go on war, to do this karma?”

20:25.440 --> 20:27.840
That is also very much misunderstood.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.160
Only after Realization you can understand

20:30.360 --> 20:34.520
what he meant by doing karma.

20:35.040 --> 20:41.080
He has said it very clear that,

20:42.080 --> 20:45.760
“You do your work, karmas, your whatever you have to do,

20:45.960 --> 20:51.080
your action, and put it at My lotus feet,”

20:51.480 --> 20:53.680
which is an impossible situation.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.000
As long as you have

20:56.200 --> 21:00.280
the sense that you are doing something - Aham-bhava -

21:00.480 --> 21:03.840
that due to ego, you might call it,

21:04.040 --> 21:07.680
as long as you have this feeling within you,

21:07.960 --> 21:09.840
or maybe

21:10.040 --> 21:14.960
when there is still that “I” is existing within you,

21:15.160 --> 21:18.520
you may say that, “I’m putting it at the lotus feet of God,”

21:18.720 --> 21:21.160
but you don’t.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.520
Because Shri Krishna knew,

21:23.720 --> 21:25.960
after Arjuna asked the question,

21:26.160 --> 21:28.200
that human nature is not straightforward.

21:28.400 --> 21:32.000
They won’t understand in a straightforward way.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.280
So he was diplomatically. He told him,

21:34.480 --> 21:38.000
“All right, put everything at my feet, which you cannot do.”

21:38.240 --> 21:40.480
So people tried that.

21:40.680 --> 21:44.800
Ages they have tried and they found out it doesn’t work out that way

21:45.040 --> 21:48.000
"Whatever we do, we feel responsible for it.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.240
So why should we think

21:51.440 --> 21:55.840
that we are putting at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna?

21:56.240 --> 22:00.080
For example, some people who were murderers they would say,

22:00.280 --> 22:01.560
“All right, we have murdered all right,

22:01.760 --> 22:05.360
but we have put it at the lotus feet of God.”

22:05.760 --> 22:11.680
This kind of a delusion happened.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.280
I mean, there were horrible people in this country

22:15.480 --> 22:20.240
who used to kill

22:20.640 --> 22:24.720
travelers in the name of Goddess.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.920
All these misunderstandings,

22:28.120 --> 22:32.240
which shooted them, they started doing it.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.520
So, he said that,

22:36.720 --> 22:40.920
“Your karma should be at My lotus feet.”

22:41.120 --> 22:45.680
It’s only possible after your Realization,

22:46.040 --> 22:49.320
when you really feel you are not doing anything.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.160
You ask Sahaja yogi to give Realization to somebody.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.880
He tells Me, "It’s not going. It’s not working.”

22:56.080 --> 23:00.400
He talks like a third person. He becomes a third person.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.280
He never thinks that he’s doing it.

23:04.480 --> 23:11.040
He is raising the Kundalini himself with his own hand.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.640
He doesn’t say, “I am doing it.”

23:13.840 --> 23:19.600
Or he’ll just say, “Doesn’t work out, Mother, doesn’t work out.”

23:19.880 --> 23:22.800
What’s the matter? He would just say,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.280
“This chakra is there. This problem is there,”

23:25.480 --> 23:29.480
but he would never say that, “I am doing it.”

23:29.680 --> 23:32.880
So, this karma, this action,

23:33.080 --> 23:38.120
becomes akarma, means “non-action”.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.120
Though you are acting, doing everything,

23:41.320 --> 23:45.600
still you don’t feel you are doing anything.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.440
That’s why he said,

23:48.640 --> 23:51.720
“Normally people would not take to Self-realization.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.360
So better to give them this condition,

23:54.560 --> 23:59.880
that whatever you do you put at the lotus feet of God.”

24:00.680 --> 24:04.760
Then, he asked about Bhakti.

24:12.600 --> 24:18.560
So, for Bhakti he said, “All right, very clever, you know.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.440
I am not that clever as he was.

24:21.640 --> 24:25.880
I am telling you everything straightforward.”

24:26.080 --> 24:29.440
Because he knew human beings are too clever,

24:29.640 --> 24:33.520
and if they are to be convinced, they cannot be convinced

24:33.720 --> 24:36.720
just by telling them straightforward things.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.440
And so he says, “All right,

24:39.640 --> 24:45.520
whatever flower, water,

24:45.760 --> 24:48.440
fruit, you give it to me, I’ll accept.”

24:48.680 --> 24:52.560
That’s the Bhakti part. But,

24:53.200 --> 24:55.840
this is now the trick.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.560
The Bhakti

25:00.560 --> 25:06.000
is to be done when there is not the other, Ananya.

25:06.640 --> 25:11.680
Ananya means there’s nobody else, you and Me.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.240
That means you should be connected to Me.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.600
Then only you can do Bhakti.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.280
But nobody understand, nobody understand the meaning of word,

25:22.480 --> 25:24.640
“Ananya”, or they don’t want to understand.

25:24.840 --> 25:29.120
Ananya means where there is not the other,

25:29.440 --> 25:32.360
means you are a Self-realized soul.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.760
That’s the Bhakti I will accept.

25:36.040 --> 25:39.040
When I get these Hari Rama people suffering from

25:39.240 --> 25:40.840
all kinds of troubles and they say,

25:41.040 --> 25:46.840
“Mother, how is it we are suffering from Shri Krishna’s troubles?”

25:47.080 --> 25:51.280
So I tell them, “You have no connection with Shri Krishna.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.240
You are not connected. Supposing this is not connected,

25:54.840 --> 25:57.400
this won’t work.

25:57.640 --> 26:03.000
And there’s a protocol. Shri Krishna is an incarnation.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.880
Even if you have to meet the Chief Minister here

26:06.080 --> 26:09.200
and you go on calling his name, you’ll be arrested.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.280
But he’s Almighty.

26:12.480 --> 26:16.240
How can you take his name so cheaply,

26:16.440 --> 26:21.720
as if he belongs to you or he is in your pocket?”

26:21.920 --> 26:24.960
So, there’s a protocol.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.800
But they were told

26:27.000 --> 26:32.280
that, “You must take the name of Shri Krishna

26:32.480 --> 26:35.520
or of Shri Ram or the name of God.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.440
Just pray to God that you should not forget God.”

26:38.640 --> 26:42.200
That’s the reason. But this not the way.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.360
Like mad, people are going on with it.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.040
That’s how the Kundalini gets spoiled.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.160
I have seen they have Vishuddhi problems

26:52.360 --> 26:55.040
and they never feel in their hands anything.

26:55.240 --> 26:58.080
They’ll go on telling you, “Mother, we don’t feel this or that.”

26:58.280 --> 27:04.320
They are Shri Krishna Bhaktas. So, their Bhakti is also wrong.

27:04.600 --> 27:09.280
But Shri Krishna, whatever is told  you have to understand it,

27:09.480 --> 27:14.280
written in small lines, what he is trying to say.

27:14.520 --> 27:19.560
His mischiefs, his childlike

27:19.960 --> 27:22.160
pranks he used to play,

27:22.360 --> 27:24.720
all were so sweet and beautiful.

27:24.920 --> 27:29.000
To create a feeling from the innocence, respect.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.160
I mean, an Indian if he sees a child

27:31.400 --> 27:35.040
he develops a kind of a feeling which is called vatsalya,

27:35.240 --> 27:38.400
the feeling of great love and affection

27:38.640 --> 27:40.960
and protection for children.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.440
But in the West I am surprised the way they are under attack.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.520
Children are so much under attack.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.960
I don’t know why are they doing it.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.040
There’s no feeling of vatsalya at all.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.960
It’s something so cruel.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.160
I don’t know if they are possessed,

27:57.360 --> 28:02.960
or there’s kind of a influence of their previous lives,

28:03.160 --> 28:06.280
or whatever it is. It’s very common with them.

28:06.480 --> 28:10.160
The way they attack innocence - small children.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.440
Impossible to understand how can human beings do that.

28:14.640 --> 28:20.360
So, Shri Krishna’s childlike behavior - so beautiful

28:20.560 --> 28:23.800
that that makes you feel that love

28:24.000 --> 28:29.440
and affection, protection, for the little child.

28:29.680 --> 28:33.240
I have to tell about Shri Krishnas sister - I was going to tell,

28:33.440 --> 28:38.240
but She thougt, I might forget.

28:41.560 --> 28:46.440
Shri Krishna had a sister, as you know - Vishnumaya -

28:46.760 --> 28:50.400
and she’s the electricity.

28:51.440 --> 28:57.640
We have seen in Cabella, in Canada,

28:57.920 --> 29:01.680
the miracles of Vishnumaya.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.880
When I went to Canada,

29:06.920 --> 29:10.200
it was said by the aboriginal people

29:10.400 --> 29:12.560
that when the Holy Mother will come,

29:12.760 --> 29:16.960
the whole sky will become red with lightning.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.440
And, the lightning started, next day.

29:21.640 --> 29:26.080
Even before it was daytime, I saw the sky red like this,

29:26.320 --> 29:29.560
completely red. So many people saw it.

29:29.840 --> 29:34.160
But, there were sixteen thousand lightnings,

29:34.360 --> 29:37.920
sixteen thousand lightnings. It was in the newspaper up there.

29:38.120 --> 29:41.000
It was going on, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum, the whole night.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.480
And I said “Now I’ll go and sit in the bathroom so it will stop.”

29:44.680 --> 29:50.440
And then it stopped. Otherwise it was going on like that.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.800
How he was connected with the Pandavas.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.480
Draupadi was also his sister.

30:06.680 --> 30:10.400
So Vishnumaya was born as Draupadi.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.360
Also, his mother was there, Yeshoda.

30:15.560 --> 30:21.760
And when Radhaji was the Mahalakshmi,

30:22.040 --> 30:28.440
Mother Mary, and she gave birth to

30:29.240 --> 30:33.360
Shri Ganesha. That was Lord Jesus Christ.

30:33.680 --> 30:38.400
In India, nobody would doubt the,

30:38.600 --> 30:41.840
the Immaculate Conception. Nobody would doubt.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.960
But, for others it is too much

30:44.160 --> 30:49.000
to believe in the Immaculate Conception.

30:49.200 --> 30:53.400
Or they are all arguing and saying all kinds of nonsensical things.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.080
Because Ganesha was created like that,

30:56.280 --> 31:02.600
and also Christ could be created like that.

31:03.760 --> 31:09.360
[Hindi: Iski koi zaroorat nahi hai – hai kya? ]

31:21.480 --> 31:26.160
So Radha, she was Mother Mary.

31:26.400 --> 31:32.480
And it is surprising if you read the Devi Mahatmya

31:32.680 --> 31:36.280
in that it’s clearly written who was Christ,

31:36.520 --> 31:40.480
that He was the support.

31:40.680 --> 31:45.640
He was called as Mahavishnu. He was the support.

31:45.840 --> 31:50.480
That’s the Mooladhara. He was the support of the universe.

31:50.680 --> 31:54.000
All these were all related people,

31:54.200 --> 31:55.680
but we are stupidly fighting

31:55.880 --> 32:01.360
because we do not have the knowledge of reality.

32:05.120 --> 32:11.160
So, Radhaji wanted to give him the name Yeshoda.

32:11.360 --> 32:16.160
So he called him Yesu. In Hebrew it is Yesu.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.800
Also in India Yeshoda is called as Jasodha.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.040
Many people called him Jeshua.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.000
That’s how he became Jesus.

32:26.600 --> 32:30.640
You can verify what I am saying on your vibrations.

32:30.840 --> 32:35.200
So, they are all related to each other,

32:35.960 --> 32:40.000
and greatest thing is

32:40.200 --> 32:43.840
they are divine people.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.280
We cannot understand that, we cannot analyze that,

32:47.560 --> 32:49.880
we cannot pass remarks about Him.

32:50.080 --> 32:53.520
It is a sign of human arrogance,

32:53.720 --> 32:56.280
because his knowledge is so limited,

32:56.480 --> 32:59.240
and with that limited knowledge he want to

32:59.440 --> 33:02.080
talk about divinity which is beyond

33:02.280 --> 33:05.880
the brains, beyond human intelligence.

33:06.080 --> 33:11.800
So only thing we can do is to be humble and to be surrendered.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.240
That’s how Islam came, which means surrender.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.920
Where are they surrendering, God knows?

33:19.120 --> 33:22.560
Or Christians, where are they following Christ?

33:22.760 --> 33:25.280
Hindus, where are they following the principle

33:25.480 --> 33:28.880
that everybody has the spirit in their heart?

33:29.080 --> 33:33.920
How can you have caste system if everybody has the spirit?

33:34.120 --> 33:37.160
Now, thank God, so many people in the whole world

33:37.360 --> 33:41.240
have become Sahaja Yogis. We are transcended

33:41.440 --> 33:47.680
all these artificial barriers in our divine life.

33:47.880 --> 33:52.160
How can Divine divide people?

33:52.360 --> 33:55.560
Some higher, some lower, cannot be.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.560
Only thing is, you have to achieve that state

33:58.760 --> 34:02.680
in which you see the whole world as a drama,

34:02.880 --> 34:04.360
as Shri Krishna has said

34:04.560 --> 34:09.360
and you are the witness, the sakshi of all that.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.160
I had to tell all the story about Shri Krishna because

34:12.360 --> 34:17.040
this River Yamuna reminds Me of all those beautiful things He did.

34:17.240 --> 34:20.880
And also I was happy yesterday, they way you’re dancing,

34:21.080 --> 34:25.040
the way you’re enjoying, which is very, very significant.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.120
And the one’s who did this before,

34:27.360 --> 34:30.720
were not saints. They were ordinary people

34:30.920 --> 34:34.600
whom Shri Krishna wanted to hold hand.

34:34.840 --> 34:38.920
They’re called raas. „Ra“ means energy. „Sa“ means with.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.800
They all were holding hands,

34:41.000 --> 34:44.960
so with the energy of Radhaji

34:45.160 --> 34:49.040
everybody was getting enlightened.

34:49.280 --> 34:55.600
All these things, as in all religions,

34:55.800 --> 34:59.640
have lost their own meaning, have lost their own form

34:59.840 --> 35:03.280
and they have become very corrupt.

35:03.480 --> 35:10.000
This is because it’s a mental attitude.

35:11.840 --> 35:17.440
If you have a mental attitude, it has its own limitations

35:17.640 --> 35:21.000
and after some time, there’s always a decline

35:21.200 --> 35:27.160
of all these mental

35:28.560 --> 35:31.360
adventures that you take

35:31.560 --> 35:34.600
because there’s no strength of truth in it.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.160
That’s how you find decline in arts,

35:38.720 --> 35:42.000
in music, in everything, there’s a decline coming.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.240
But now you people have found the Truth,

35:45.440 --> 35:51.280
so please try and understand that

35:51.480 --> 35:55.520
the Truth is the one which is eternal

35:55.720 --> 35:58.120
and the Truth is Love.

35:58.320 --> 36:01.160
Truth is Divine Love

36:01.360 --> 36:05.280
and this Divine Love has no consequences.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.480
It doesn’t blame anything, doesn’t want anything,

36:07.680 --> 36:09.360
it just wants to love.

36:09.600 --> 36:13.280
And when you see this All-Pervading Power being kind-

36:13.480 --> 36:17.200
everybody here has had some sort of a miracle

36:17.400 --> 36:21.640
and most of them have told Me so many miracles that

36:21.840 --> 36:24.880
"Mother, this happened, that happened, that happened."

36:25.080 --> 36:31.160
It’s all done by this All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

36:31.360 --> 36:36.600
And also to convince you it is doing so many things interesting

36:36.800 --> 36:42.000
of showing

36:42.280 --> 36:45.400
different types of my photographs, this and that,

36:45.640 --> 36:48.400
but the best was this time in Navaratri.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.680
I mean, my photograph I saw a background

36:51.880 --> 36:54.280
which was rather very different,

36:54.480 --> 36:58.080
like something round was there and there was a curtain

36:58.280 --> 37:02.360
and somebody peeking through that, like the sun peeping out.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.960
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised

37:06.160 --> 37:08.720
the whole scene was behind Me there.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.680
So it was before it was even made or conceived.

37:12.880 --> 37:18.560
It was seen there in Navaratri Puja.

37:18.760 --> 37:22.640
That means all these things also that you are conceiving

37:22.840 --> 37:26.080
are suggested by the Divine.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.920
Otherwise, how can it be possible that

37:29.120 --> 37:32.360
one month before we got that kind of a photograph,

37:32.560 --> 37:35.480
which I was wondering, how can that be behind Me?

37:35.680 --> 37:39.600
And that was there when we went to Moscow everybody saw this.

37:39.840 --> 37:43.560
It’s very surprising. So all kinds of tricks He’s playing.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.520
Even when I’m not there, He shows that I’m there

37:46.720 --> 37:49.360
and it’s working out in so many ways

37:49.600 --> 37:54.400
that one has to understand that what we think is miracle

37:54.600 --> 37:58.680
is a play of this All-Pervading Power.

37:58.880 --> 38:04.040
I hope you have enjoyed your stay here

38:04.720 --> 38:09.800
and we have still a big tour to go on.

38:11.440 --> 38:16.520
I hope more people are coming now, so

38:16.800 --> 38:21.040
you are all comfortable here.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.320
After realization, actually I have seen

38:24.520 --> 38:27.280
people don’t care for physical comforts.

38:27.480 --> 38:31.040
They just care for the comforts of the spirit.

38:31.240 --> 38:36.800
People are very deep and you have met the people of India.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.960
They’re also very deep people, very good humble people.

38:41.200 --> 38:45.240
We are all part and parcel of One Body

38:45.440 --> 38:49.600
and that’s what one has to remember.

38:50.120 --> 38:53.480
I hope you’re all right, all of you and tomorrow,

38:53.680 --> 38:56.680
you don’t know, it’s a very, very cold place they say. Let’s see.

38:56.920 --> 39:00.960
As the sun has come here, maybe the same sun will help us there.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.360
May God bless you.
