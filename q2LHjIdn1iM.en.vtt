WEBVTT

36:11.535 --> 36:13.717
I have to tell

36:13.749 --> 36:20.463
you thank you very much for this celebration,
for all these beautiful balloons; but, looking

36:20.488 --> 36:24.907
at these balloons, we have to
also see some of them who have lost their

36:24.932 --> 36:26.813
air completely.

36:28.030 --> 36:36.320
This is another problem we face in the West
because to have ego itself, according to the

36:36.345 --> 36:40.095
Western culture, is a very great achievement.

36:40.751 --> 36:48.693
And when we start living with our ego I know
how one looks like.

36:48.757 --> 36:53.767
He really looks like a stupid fellow.

36:53.767 --> 37:02.897
When he talks, when he describes himself,
you don't know where to look because just

37:02.897 --> 37:06.375
feel like laughing at his stupidity.

37:06.685 --> 37:12.940
Ego is the outcome of stupidity.

37:12.940 --> 37:21.720
I don't know what to say; how to give a simile
to ego, because it's just bloated and makes

37:21.720 --> 37:30.411
you float in the air, and when it bursts you
are down on the earth.

37:30.411 --> 37:35.960
But you are not down on the earth the way
Sahaja Yogis should be down to earth; but

37:35.960 --> 37:39.280
you are completely finished.

37:39.280 --> 37:44.360
All your arrogance goes to waste.

37:44.360 --> 37:49.390
You can never understand Sahaja Yoga if you
have this ego in your head.

37:49.390 --> 37:52.650
I have known people who have this ego.

37:52.650 --> 37:58.690
They have come to Sahaja Yoga and still they
want to think that they know more than anybody

37:58.690 --> 37:59.760
else.

37:59.760 --> 38:10.620
To know about yourself you have to go deep
down, and to go deep down you have to give

38:10.620 --> 38:17.580
up all this idea which makes you float in
the air.

38:17.580 --> 38:20.390
Imagine if you have a big balloon attached
to you.

38:20.390 --> 38:24.380
How can you go deep down into the sea?

38:24.380 --> 38:26.980
You cannot.

38:26.980 --> 38:41.390
That kind of a air which makes you float in
the air, absolutely in an area of stupidity,

38:41.390 --> 38:49.620
what else -I mean English you will think there
are no words- stupidity means everything.

38:49.620 --> 38:53.320
Then you may think no end of yourself.

38:53.320 --> 38:58.810
You may think whatever you like, you can behave
the way you like and all that but what do

38:58.810 --> 39:00.570
you achieve?

39:00.570 --> 39:05.860
You achieve nothing out of it.

39:05.860 --> 39:10.079
Whatever you achieve people are jealous of
you.

39:10.079 --> 39:11.080
They want to harm you.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.130
You have no friends.

39:14.130 --> 39:21.419
Nobody cares for you, and in Sahaja Yoga people
know who has got this problem.

39:21.419 --> 39:28.889
So, I've seen people when they start talking
they say, “Ah!

39:28.889 --> 39:31.409
We know, we know him.”

39:31.409 --> 39:38.840
Once I had an experience, long, long time
back in Pune where the people who were owning

39:38.840 --> 39:47.859
that wada said that we cannot have Shri Mataji's
program because She is not a Brahmin.

39:47.859 --> 39:51.210
So the Sahaja Yogis said, all right we'll
give it in the newspaper because She is not

39:51.210 --> 39:56.320
a Brahmin we cannot have a program.

39:56.320 --> 40:04.449
So, these people came to My program and the
owner of that was sitting on the gallery on

40:04.449 --> 40:05.449
top.

40:05.449 --> 40:06.479
He couldn't even walk.

40:06.479 --> 40:12.199
He was suffering from some sort of a funny
disease.

40:12.199 --> 40:13.600
So these people suddenly start.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.600
I didn't know.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.600
They didn't tell Me anything.

40:15.600 --> 40:19.479
They didn't tell Me that these people have
protested or whatever it is.

40:19.479 --> 40:26.780
So they all started shaking like this, like
this, like this.

40:26.780 --> 40:31.639
I said, “What is this?”

40:31.639 --> 40:35.930
So I said, “What is it?”

40:35.930 --> 40:37.430
They said “Mother, stop it.

40:37.430 --> 40:39.870
We know You are Shakti but stop it.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.550
It's too much, too much.”

40:41.550 --> 40:43.229
“But what did you do?”

40:43.229 --> 40:45.240
They said, “We didn't do anything.

40:45.240 --> 40:51.240
We just said this is a Brahmin's thing and
a Brahmin's wada, and this area is mostly

40:51.240 --> 40:57.879
resided by Brahmins, so we thought that You
cannot have your program.”

40:57.879 --> 41:00.160
I said, “Really, that's all ?”

41:00.160 --> 41:01.690
“Yes, yes, that's all.

41:01.690 --> 41:05.000
But it's, you see on the other side, you see
those people?

41:05.000 --> 41:09.600
They are also shaking with Your power.”

41:09.600 --> 41:12.650
So I asked them, “Who are you?

41:12.650 --> 41:13.879
Are you also Brahmins ?”

41:13.879 --> 41:15.120
They said, "No, no.

41:15.120 --> 41:19.319
We are certified mad people from Thana.”

41:19.319 --> 41:22.160
“And how are you here?”

41:22.160 --> 41:25.840
They said, “There was one fellow who was
mad was cured by You.”

41:25.840 --> 41:26.840
“Really?”

41:26.840 --> 41:29.810
“So our superintendent is here.

41:29.810 --> 41:33.120
He has brought us here.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.770
We are certified mad.

41:35.770 --> 41:36.770
Certified.”

41:36.770 --> 41:40.219
My goodness, these people looked at Me.

41:40.219 --> 41:42.300
I said, “See now, you tally.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.300
You are shaking and they are shaking.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.520
Now you tally.

41:46.520 --> 41:52.350
Where are you?”

41:52.350 --> 41:53.350
And they all became Sahaja Yogis.

41:53.350 --> 41:58.699
Not only that but the gentleman sitting upstairs
I told him, "You get up and come down."

41:58.699 --> 42:01.150
He came
and since that day he has surrendered his

42:01.150 --> 42:05.560
life and did a lot of work in Pune.

42:05.560 --> 42:11.410
So what I'm saying that anybody who talks
like that; that “This is wrong, in Sahaja

42:11.410 --> 42:18.419
Yoga, this should not happen, we should not
have paid so much, or this leader is not good”;

42:18.419 --> 42:27.270
should take a paper, thin paper, on his hand,
and put it before the photograph.

42:27.270 --> 42:32.139
If you can stop the shaking then you are all
right.

42:32.139 --> 42:40.650
All of you can try this.

42:40.650 --> 42:41.650
Then try on the right hand.

42:41.650 --> 42:42.650
Very practical.

42:42.650 --> 42:51.790
If the paper is shaking that means Mr. Ego
is shaking, and you know how to treat your

42:51.790 --> 42:56.220
ego in Sahaja Yoga, thanks to Mohammed Sahib.

42:56.220 --> 43:00.289
He has told us how to treat it.

43:00.289 --> 43:04.039
Now these two problems are within us.

43:04.039 --> 43:12.349
One of them is our conditioning and another
is this ego business, and we make our mind

43:12.349 --> 43:19.719
out of that and we are playing under the governance
of these two things which we have used to

43:19.719 --> 43:22.190
make this mind.

43:22.190 --> 43:24.430
Now you have to be careful.

43:24.430 --> 43:25.579
You find out with left hand.

43:25.579 --> 43:26.579
Now let's see.

43:26.579 --> 43:30.050
If the left hand is shaking then you are conditioned.

43:30.050 --> 43:35.040
If the right hand is shaking then you are
egoistical.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.850
So now you treat it.

43:38.850 --> 43:40.100
You treat these two things.

43:40.100 --> 43:44.230
Before Me you'll get vibrations all right
because you see I am your Mother.

43:44.230 --> 43:45.390
All right.

43:45.390 --> 43:47.320
But that doesn't mean you are all right.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.290
You try on My photograph; that's much more
sharp.

43:50.290 --> 43:54.330
So being Mother you know I play around.

43:54.330 --> 44:00.500
I think, I don't know what I should say, but
maybe you may not feel that way.

44:00.500 --> 44:06.589
But before the photograph you put on the left
hand side a newspaper or a little paper or

44:06.589 --> 44:07.699
a thin paper.

44:07.699 --> 44:10.560
On the right hand side another paper.

44:10.560 --> 44:14.570
One by one you try and judge yourself, what
are you?

44:14.570 --> 44:22.110
After all you have not come here in Sahaja
Yoga to emancipate Me.

44:22.110 --> 44:29.350
You have come here to evolve yourself and
because of that you have to face yourself

44:29.350 --> 44:37.170
and see for yourself what is within you which
is very strong, which is troublesome, which

44:37.170 --> 44:40.910
is dragging you down, which is killing.

44:40.910 --> 44:49.490
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but Ocean of Joy.

44:49.490 --> 44:56.949
I thought that in My absence you'll be all
enjoying it all right; you do.

44:56.949 --> 45:03.130
Airport I have seen sometimes I am late because
of the plane, about four hours, five hours,

45:03.130 --> 45:07.209
and everybody is so fresh, and so nice early
in the morning.

45:07.209 --> 45:08.209
I said, “What's happened ?”

45:08.209 --> 45:11.199
“The whole night we have been enjoying Mother.”

45:11.199 --> 45:18.009
So what you enjoy in that is collectivity:
Sangat That collectivity you should enjoy

45:18.009 --> 45:24.700
only by getting rid of your nonsensical boundaries
that you have built, and then you see the

45:24.700 --> 45:25.700
joy.

45:25.700 --> 45:33.389
All the time you'll be floating in joy.

45:33.389 --> 45:40.300
There is a sense which people have which you
may not have before realization.

45:40.300 --> 45:47.880
Some of the people, I was amazed how deep
they are, how they took to Sahaja Yoga.

45:47.880 --> 45:51.880
Supposed to be very great men.

45:51.880 --> 45:58.440
Supposed to be people of very great principles
but very hot-tempered, intolerant about people,

45:58.440 --> 46:07.490
and they take to Sahaja Yoga just like this
because inside there's a big depth, so that

46:07.490 --> 46:11.759
everything is absorbed without any problem.

46:11.759 --> 46:18.259
Everybody can achieve but one has to be careful
as to the two wheels of our mind.

46:18.259 --> 46:23.710
One is the ego, another is the conditioning.

46:23.710 --> 46:27.370
All kinds of conditionings are there, especially
in India.

46:27.370 --> 46:31.199
In the West it is all kinds of egos you know,
different, different types.

46:31.199 --> 46:39.694
I have seen so many types and varieties of
egos, I was surprised; to face that.

46:39.694 --> 46:41.399
I didn't know what to say.

46:41.399 --> 46:48.779
It's a very, very subtle thing which people
have carved out of their minds.

46:48.779 --> 46:57.640
So for you today it is to be decided that
you are only still small children, and like

46:57.640 --> 47:09.259
small children you must have a very clean
heart to accept, to absorb the beauty of peace

47:09.259 --> 47:16.370
that is within you; and also the beauty of
purity.

47:16.370 --> 47:19.800
Without purity you cannot enjoy anything.

47:19.800 --> 47:30.839
So in Sahaja Yoga though we have so many people
I must say the purity of these few saints,

47:30.839 --> 47:37.860
who lived earlier, we have to yet achieve.

47:37.860 --> 47:40.920
For example, yesterday they were singing about
Ali.

47:40.920 --> 47:47.370
I was so very happy because He was an Incarnation.

47:47.370 --> 47:50.110
And His purity people are singing now; not
at that time.

47:50.110 --> 47:52.850
He was killed at that time, He was tortured.

47:52.850 --> 47:54.700
That always they do.

47:54.700 --> 47:56.180
Then we have many others.

47:56.180 --> 47:58.260
We have here Dam Dam Sahib.

47:58.260 --> 48:03.060
See what a great thing to come to.

48:03.060 --> 48:06.580
We have here Nizamuddin Auliya.

48:06.580 --> 48:14.370
We have so many people in our country itself
that nobody, no other country can claim.

48:14.370 --> 48:19.100
They have one, say in England they have William
Blake or this and that.

48:19.100 --> 48:21.279
We had so many people.

48:21.279 --> 48:22.279
Why?

48:22.279 --> 48:29.819
Not because we were very good people, but
because we were to be improved.

48:29.819 --> 48:32.639
Things had to be done.

48:32.639 --> 48:33.639
So they were born.

48:33.639 --> 48:41.899
Though this is a Yoga Bhoomi anywhere you
go in India, I was surprised, in Haryana so

48:41.899 --> 48:48.060
many great saints lived there.

48:48.060 --> 48:51.350
But they were all tortured, troubled, never
understood.

48:51.350 --> 49:00.469
It was so painful and hurts you how this stupid,
ignorant, blind people tortured them.

49:00.469 --> 49:07.920
So now it is our duty of Sahaja Yogis to,
first of all, find out who is a saint.

49:07.920 --> 49:12.480
Even among Sahaja Yogis, as I described in
Hindi language, there are people who try to

49:12.480 --> 49:16.230
trouble, trouble others.

49:16.230 --> 49:27.560
If you have no recognition and understanding
of what is the truth, what is love, what is

49:27.560 --> 49:31.649
pure compassion, then you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

49:31.649 --> 49:36.560
It's like an obtuse angle you see, you have.

49:36.560 --> 49:44.310
You look at a person with an obtuse angle
you don't see anything, one-sided.

49:44.310 --> 49:53.910
Now, at this juncture when I am so very old
now; I have to request that you turn your

49:53.910 --> 49:56.380
eyes to yourself.

49:56.380 --> 49:57.380
Introspect.

49:57.380 --> 50:04.670
Because among you there are some people who
will try to divert your attention, will try

50:04.670 --> 50:06.329
to say things.

50:06.329 --> 50:11.800
Very easy to say, “He is very dishonest,
he is very immoral”; very easy to say.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.430
What are you?

50:14.430 --> 50:24.410
We have to now understand that Sahaja Yoga
is to be consolidated through synthesis.

50:24.410 --> 50:26.920
We are believers of synthesis.

50:26.920 --> 50:31.529
Any divisive thing that comes into your mind
you should just throw it away.

50:31.529 --> 50:37.900
This is a request on this day I make you - that
you please introspect.

50:37.900 --> 50:42.580
Unless and until you introspect you cannot
even respect yourself.

50:42.580 --> 50:45.130
You cannot even love yourself.

50:45.130 --> 50:49.219
If you love yourself you will introspect and
find out what's wrong.

50:49.219 --> 50:58.680
Supposing I love this sari, then if I find
any doubt about it or see any dot somewhere

50:58.680 --> 51:01.209
or something I'll get it cleaned.

51:01.209 --> 51:05.759
I'll not be proud of it, wear it and go round
saying, “Ah!

51:05.759 --> 51:09.689
See I've got so many spots.”

51:09.689 --> 51:19.980
In the same way, you should be not proud of
whatever asahaj temperaments you have within

51:19.980 --> 51:21.050
yourself.

51:21.050 --> 51:23.339
And don't talk like that.

51:23.339 --> 51:26.389
Christ has called them 'murmuring souls'.

51:26.389 --> 51:31.100
He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls”.

51:31.100 --> 51:33.800
I would say: "Throw away all the murmuring
souls".

51:33.800 --> 51:37.360
That's the only way.

51:37.360 --> 51:44.220
In Hindi as they say 'bakwas’; their name
is bakwas; means the ones who just chatter,

51:44.220 --> 51:47.920
chatter, chatter; talk all nonsense about
others.

51:47.920 --> 51:53.519
He doesn't know what he is.

51:53.519 --> 51:58.139
It is much more in India, I must confess.

51:58.139 --> 52:01.229
I'm sorry, though I'm an Indian.

52:01.229 --> 52:06.400
It is a habit of talking ill of others, sitting
down just chit-chatting.

52:06.400 --> 52:08.869
They will not talk of Sahaja Yoga.

52:08.869 --> 52:13.890
How many people know Sahaja Yoga in the proper
way?

52:13.890 --> 52:18.420
I mean if I have to give degrees, what degrees
I should give to you?

52:18.420 --> 52:19.520
Tell Me.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.460
You don't know even about your vibrations.

52:22.460 --> 52:30.380
Of course you are Sahaja Yogis because you
have fallen into this trap of achieving evolution.

52:30.380 --> 52:34.859
But how many are really grown up into it?

52:34.859 --> 52:36.050
You can.

52:36.050 --> 52:42.310
So I have to again and again tell you, to
make Me happy, you have to give up all these

52:42.310 --> 52:51.180
nonsensical, cheapish talks; but try to understand
from each other what we know of Sahaja Yoga.

52:51.180 --> 53:03.570
Discuss it and contribute to this knowledge
by describing your experiences of Sahaja Yoga.

53:03.570 --> 53:05.010
There are many who do it.

53:05.010 --> 53:06.869
I am not saying they don't do.

53:06.869 --> 53:12.800
But even there's one bad fellow he can spoil
all of them; like one bad apple can spoil

53:12.800 --> 53:14.260
all the apples.

53:14.260 --> 53:17.810
So what do we do -throw away the apple out
of the basket.

53:17.810 --> 53:32.020
It is important see, even I feel all this,
standing like a witness to you, silent witness.

53:32.020 --> 53:46.390
When I see big, big mountains, and I think
they are like great saints who are watching,

53:46.390 --> 53:55.940
and they are trying to record what is happening
in this world because they also understand.

53:55.940 --> 53:59.150
They also know.

53:59.150 --> 54:08.330
I have to again, and again, tell you that
today is the day to see your own self, your

54:08.330 --> 54:13.510
own chakras, your own - I should say - defects.

54:13.510 --> 54:21.880
That will give you permanently the joy that
is promised.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.270
You will get thoughtless awareness.

54:25.270 --> 54:28.660
Also you'll get doubtless awareness.

54:28.660 --> 54:38.460
But never get into the trap of your conditioning
and of your ego.

54:38.460 --> 54:44.989
This is what I have to tell you today, on
this day where you are celebrating, that you

54:44.989 --> 54:47.150
celebrate your own birthday.

54:47.150 --> 54:49.010
Celebrate it.

54:49.010 --> 54:54.040
See for yourself what you have achieved and
what you are going to achieve.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.719
It's time for you to celebrate than to celebrate
My birthday.

54:56.719 --> 55:03.064
I'll be very happy to celebrate your birthday
than to celebrate Mine.

55:04.014 --> 55:05.439
So may God bless you.
