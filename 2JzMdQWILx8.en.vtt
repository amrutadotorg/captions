00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.837
We all have today gathered here

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.753
on top of this beautiful mountain,

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:17.170
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.129
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:28.546
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.920
by which He showed

00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:36.586
that the spirit does not die.

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:41.379
He was – He was the Omkara,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.129
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.296
and that is why He could walk on the water.

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:58.170
And also now we have made a film

00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:03.753
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:07.296
which shows the carbon atom,

00:01:07.837 --> 00:01:11.586
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:15.546
you find a proper swastika there;

00:01:15.837 --> 00:01:21.296
and left to the right we see Omkara.

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:24.296
But when you see from down below upward,

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:28.296
what you see is alpha and omega.

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:33.170
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:36.837
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:43.712
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:48.087
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:54.087
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:59.045
I don’t know at the time of Christ

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:03.212
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:05.837
but definitely to Him

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:10.962
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:24.004
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

00:02:24.587 --> 00:02:29.712
and very important for our ascent.

00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:34.628
If He had not resurrected Himself,

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:39.170
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:42.587
So it’s a great contribution.

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:47.837
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

00:02:48.712 --> 00:02:51.795
what you were before

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.379
and what you are today.

00:02:58.337 --> 00:03:01.296
It is such a change,

00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:03.837
such a difference,

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.087
such a transformation.

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:11.546
It is His own sacrifice

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.462
on the cross

00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:17.462
and His own

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.504
beautiful resurrection

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:24.004
has created a way for all of us

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:29.586
to get into this new transformed state.

00:03:34.296 --> 00:03:40.212
In this state is a different story for human beings,

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:43.045
and a different for Christ.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.462
Christ was Himself

00:03:45.795 --> 00:03:49.962
was holiness, was purity.

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:53.920
So His resurrection

00:03:54.212 --> 00:04:00.670
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

00:04:02.296 --> 00:04:06.170
because He did not need transformation,

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:09.753
He did not

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:14.546
have to go through any cleansing.

00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:19.337
But what happened in His case

00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:25.129
was that He became

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:29.795
resurrected from death

00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:34.837
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:37.795
is like a death;

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.170
because they do everything

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:46.129
without any understanding about the totality,

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:49.504
about the reality,

00:04:49.837 --> 00:04:52.878
about the absolute truth.

00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:55.462
Whatever they do ultimately

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:59.962
takes them to their destruction.

00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:04.962
Even the religions which are established

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:07.421
by these great incarnations

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:12.212
are absolutely on a decline.

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:16.587
You do not find any trace of religious life

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:18.504
with all those people

00:05:18.837 --> 00:05:21.712
who claim that they are the ones

00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:25.837
who can represent those incarnations.

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:29.587
If you see in a subtle way

00:05:30.004 --> 00:05:31.920
it’s very painful also,

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:36.421
that in the name of all these great incarnations

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:39.337
the kind of work people are doing,

00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:44.296
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:47.586
because they have no fear of God.

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:51.087
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.087
all over the world.

00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:54.504
Of course here,

00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:56.712
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

00:05:57.045 --> 00:05:58.962
Everywhere people are seeing

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.628
all these false things have been exposed.

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:06.878
But these false things they have used

00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:11.337
under a garb of God,

00:06:11.628 --> 00:06:14.546
spirituality and beauty.

00:06:14.962 --> 00:06:18.170
That’s the best way you can hide.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:23.670
All the cruelty, all the violence,

00:06:24.587 --> 00:06:27.504
all the ugliness

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.837
– this is how they have worked it out.

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:34.920
And it has gone into such a state

00:06:35.337 --> 00:06:38.337
that you do not find the slightest

00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:43.212
even tinge of religious life among these people.

00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:45.628
Like all the thieves of the world,

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:47.920
all the great crooks of the world

00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:51.920
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.462
It’s only because what was written in all the books

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:02.628
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:05.587
was never done.

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:10.586
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:14.421
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

00:07:14.837 --> 00:07:17.212
He also said that “You are to be born again”

00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:20.504
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:26.337
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.628
But they don’t think that actually

00:07:31.004 --> 00:07:33.587
what benevolence it has given them.

00:07:34.004 --> 00:07:35.837
At the most they might have made some money,

00:07:36.254 --> 00:07:39.628
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

00:07:40.004 --> 00:07:46.004
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:52.753
One must pity their insanity,

00:07:53.504 --> 00:07:57.212
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

00:07:57.586 --> 00:07:59.129
or to anybody else’s life

00:07:59.504 --> 00:08:03.837
of such a noble and a higher value system,

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:10.337
and are doing all very low-graded things.

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:17.504
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

00:08:18.087 --> 00:08:21.670
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

00:08:22.337 --> 00:08:26.379
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:31.379
that you are coming from that environment,

00:08:32.462 --> 00:08:34.586
that style of life,

00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:37.212
that kind of thinking

00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:39.795
which was all for your destruction.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.462
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:47.504
So when you’re coming out of it,

00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:50.962
still these things hang over,

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:56.337
still you get affected by them.

00:08:56.878 --> 00:08:59.546
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

00:08:59.837 --> 00:09:03.129
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

00:09:03.462 --> 00:09:06.004
to some sort of a funny situation,

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:11.795
to some sort of a degrading things.

00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.254
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

00:09:15.628 --> 00:09:18.504
sometimes you accept all that.

00:09:18.962 --> 00:09:21.296
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

00:09:21.586 --> 00:09:23.379
that after coming to realization

00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:26.795
he has to be very introspective.

00:09:27.212 --> 00:09:29.045
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:33.170
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

00:09:33.712 --> 00:09:37.920
It’s very important that you have to know

00:09:38.337 --> 00:09:42.254
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.129
Because Christ did not need this,

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:51.462
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

00:09:51.962 --> 00:09:58.296
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:05.462
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

00:10:05.795 --> 00:10:08.129
on the sense that from He died

00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:11.628
and then He resurrected Himself.

00:10:12.087 --> 00:10:15.337
But for us it is very different.

00:10:15.753 --> 00:10:18.753
We are now Sahaja yogis,

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:22.628
but we were ordinary human beings.

00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:25.504
We had no light within us.

00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:27.920
Now the light comes within us

00:10:28.296 --> 00:10:30.586
and we see the light,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.296
then what do we become?

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.170
We have to become the light itself.

00:10:38.712 --> 00:10:40.337
Christ was the light.

00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:42.254
He did not have to become.

00:10:42.587 --> 00:10:44.587
So we have to become the light.

00:10:44.878 --> 00:10:48.795
And now you have to guard on

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.254
the way this light might get disturbed,

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:58.920
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

00:11:00.587 --> 00:11:05.045
So carrying on yourself with this light,

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:07.753
first thing you should know that

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.421
if you see the light, is not proper

00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:12.087
– means you are not the light.

00:11:12.462 --> 00:11:15.920
You have to become the light.

00:11:17.212 --> 00:11:18.753
When you are the light,

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:21.795
then in that light you can easily see

00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:24.628
how your mind works,

00:11:25.129 --> 00:11:27.212
what ideas it gives,

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:34.129
what affects your mind

00:11:34.837 --> 00:11:36.795
while you’re ascending.

00:11:37.129 --> 00:11:39.045
Is this the worry

00:11:39.337 --> 00:11:44.837
or is this the responsibility that you have?

00:11:45.212 --> 00:11:49.462
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

00:11:49.878 --> 00:11:51.628
that there is an impediment

00:11:52.004 --> 00:11:57.129
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

00:11:57.837 --> 00:12:00.586
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

00:12:00.962 --> 00:12:05.962
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

00:12:07.462 --> 00:12:10.462
It’s a very beautiful journey

00:12:10.837 --> 00:12:12.546
– very, very beautiful journey.

00:12:13.004 --> 00:12:15.212
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:20.212
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:26.462
the journey of kundalini.

00:12:28.546 --> 00:12:36.170
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

00:12:37.837 --> 00:12:42.546
Basically you were not a realized soul,

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.795
but now you are a realized soul.

00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:48.170
You are a evolved state.

00:12:48.628 --> 00:12:54.379
Now what is missing is the idea

00:12:54.837 --> 00:12:59.795
that we are absolutely all right

00:13:00.296 --> 00:13:04.587
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:10.628
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:13.795
it’s not going to help you at all.

00:13:14.296 --> 00:13:17.296
What you have to do is to

00:13:18.087 --> 00:13:19.920
all the time introspect yourself.

00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:22.504
That’s what is meditation for,

00:13:22.878 --> 00:13:24.421
to see for yourself

00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:28.878
how you are keeping up

00:13:29.379 --> 00:13:32.546
your spiritual ascent.

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.462
No one else can do it,

00:13:34.878 --> 00:13:37.296
it’s your own individual work.

00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.546
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:42.587
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:46.712
They may not say, they may not refer it,

00:13:47.129 --> 00:13:48.586
but they will know definitely

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:50.712
that such-and-such chakra is catching

00:13:51.129 --> 00:13:53.045
and this person has this problem.

00:13:53.462 --> 00:13:58.170
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:02.670
what is their problem is.

00:14:03.212 --> 00:14:05.129
So if somebody tells you

00:14:05.504 --> 00:14:07.379
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.379
you should never, never feel bad about it,

00:14:10.712 --> 00:14:13.421
because by keeping that chakra intact

00:14:13.712 --> 00:14:16.628
you are ruining your own life.

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:19.586
So what you have to do is to see

00:14:19.962 --> 00:14:21.712
that if somebody tells you that

00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:26.004
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:28.962
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.962
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

00:14:32.337 --> 00:14:34.504
there’s something wrong with your face,

00:14:34.795 --> 00:14:36.212
you can immediately correct it.

00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:40.212
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

00:14:40.587 --> 00:14:44.004
you have to be mature enough that you should know

00:14:44.337 --> 00:14:46.004
that it is a great blessing

00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:49.504
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

00:14:50.504 --> 00:14:52.170
Like the other day there was some quarrel

00:14:52.504 --> 00:14:53.920
between the two leaders.

00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:56.753
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

00:14:57.045 --> 00:14:58.337
There should not be.

00:14:58.546 --> 00:15:02.129
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:03.795
two legs do not fight.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.087
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

00:15:07.504 --> 00:15:11.628
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

00:15:12.421 --> 00:15:15.212
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:20.170
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.212
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.878
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:28.878
When he puts his hand towards Me,

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:32.170
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

00:15:32.504 --> 00:15:34.712
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:38.920
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:41.421
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

00:15:41.753 --> 00:15:45.462
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

00:15:46.296 --> 00:15:51.546
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.462
because I said it to him.

00:15:55.087 --> 00:15:58.045
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

00:15:58.546 --> 00:16:00.379
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:01.837
what is good for him.

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.587
He did not feel bad at all.

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:06.087
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

00:16:06.462 --> 00:16:09.254
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

00:16:09.628 --> 00:16:14.004
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:24.587
Now, the problem with us is that

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.212
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

00:16:30.296 --> 00:16:32.712
and we have consolidated it.

00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:35.212
Also, we have a great collective force,

00:16:35.587 --> 00:16:38.087
I can see, in every country.

00:16:38.546 --> 00:16:41.254
We can give realizations to so many,

00:16:41.712 --> 00:16:44.254
and we can really establish

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:49.379
all these great truths in our lives.

00:16:49.795 --> 00:16:51.212
We can do it.

00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:55.087
All the time we should establish them.

00:16:55.878 --> 00:16:59.254
But there is one point

00:16:59.628 --> 00:17:02.712
on which one should not be very sure:

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:09.337
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:13.004
You have to be careful on this point very much.

00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:19.212
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:19.587 --> 00:17:24.296
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

00:17:25.379 --> 00:17:28.712
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:32.504
The reason is that they have no faith

00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:39.462
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

00:17:40.753 --> 00:17:43.546
This is the faith which is missing.

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:48.753
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

00:17:49.337 --> 00:17:53.712
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

00:17:55.462 --> 00:18:02.045
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

00:18:04.962 --> 00:18:09.753
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

00:18:10.087 --> 00:18:11.878
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

00:18:12.212 --> 00:18:14.296
– you have known that it is so.

00:18:14.628 --> 00:18:16.296
But even knowing that,

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:20.129
it has not become such a faith within you.

00:18:20.587 --> 00:18:24.379
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

00:18:24.795 --> 00:18:27.254
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

00:18:27.586 --> 00:18:29.087
not the blind faith.

00:18:29.504 --> 00:18:32.920
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:37.462
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

00:18:37.753 --> 00:18:42.712
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.337
There cannot be any problems

00:18:45.712 --> 00:18:49.170
if your faith is enlightened.

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:52.837
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

00:18:53.254 --> 00:18:56.670
many people who are very steady,

00:18:58.586 --> 00:19:01.587
who are upright,

00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:04.462
who are very valuable.

00:19:05.004 --> 00:19:06.795
They are like the people

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.337
who know they are standing on the rocks.

00:19:10.878 --> 00:19:14.920
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

00:19:15.212 --> 00:19:18.337
they think they are still dwindling

00:19:18.712 --> 00:19:24.421
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

00:19:26.546 --> 00:19:30.628
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:35.254
and also that has come out of faith

00:19:35.587 --> 00:19:38.753
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:41.753
nothing can trouble us.

00:19:42.296 --> 00:19:45.587
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

00:19:46.004 --> 00:19:47.670
I mean, He knew everything,

00:19:48.045 --> 00:19:50.087
so He was sure about it.

00:19:50.586 --> 00:19:54.254
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

00:19:54.753 --> 00:19:58.296
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

00:19:58.712 --> 00:20:01.337
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

00:20:01.753 --> 00:20:04.504
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

00:20:04.878 --> 00:20:06.753
It is so.

00:20:07.212 --> 00:20:11.421
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:15.254
while the other people,

00:20:17.962 --> 00:20:19.878
even Sahaja yogis,

00:20:20.254 --> 00:20:23.546
have to become like Christ

00:20:23.878 --> 00:20:26.795
as far as the faith is concerned.

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:31.753
This faith is to be understood.

00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:35.379
This is an enlightened faith.

00:20:35.795 --> 00:20:40.087
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

00:20:40.504 --> 00:20:42.962
He went into all kinds of things,

00:20:43.421 --> 00:20:47.379
just because He knew it was just a drama

00:20:47.712 --> 00:20:52.004
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

00:20:52.462 --> 00:20:55.753
and there’s nothing serious,

00:20:56.712 --> 00:20:57.920
nothing is going to matter,

00:20:58.254 --> 00:20:59.753
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

00:21:00.129 --> 00:21:02.379
He played the drama.

00:21:02.878 --> 00:21:06.337
To Him it was nothing very serious.

00:21:08.753 --> 00:21:12.586
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

00:21:13.212 --> 00:21:17.337
He also in His heart knew everything that

00:21:17.712 --> 00:21:21.712
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:26.586
But at the same time,

00:21:27.587 --> 00:21:30.504
He was the embodiment of faith:

00:21:31.004 --> 00:21:35.504
faith in Himself

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:39.586
and in this all-pervading Power.

00:21:41.004 --> 00:21:43.296
This never lets you down,

00:21:43.753 --> 00:21:48.670
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:54.129
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

00:21:55.379 --> 00:21:59.462
naturally I will give him all the work,

00:22:00.045 --> 00:22:02.379
I will trust everything,

00:22:02.795 --> 00:22:05.712
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

00:22:06.045 --> 00:22:09.337
never doubt such a person.

00:22:10.504 --> 00:22:15.753
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

00:22:16.421 --> 00:22:23.212
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

00:22:24.004 --> 00:22:28.129
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.712
how life will improve

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.296
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

00:22:37.837 --> 00:22:40.129
You’ll have no doubts,

00:22:40.504 --> 00:22:45.254
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

00:22:47.878 --> 00:22:52.045
So, this is such a state

00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:54.296
– only with faith.

00:22:54.795 --> 00:22:57.546
But now this faith, how do you get?

00:22:57.962 --> 00:23:02.129
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

00:23:02.504 --> 00:23:03.920
There’s no course about it,

00:23:04.337 --> 00:23:06.129
there’s no literature about it,

00:23:06.504 --> 00:23:08.753
there’s no lecture about it.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:14.628
But there is an awakening within you

00:23:15.087 --> 00:23:19.129
which will ask this

00:23:19.712 --> 00:23:22.170
“What am I?” – this awakening,

00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:24.962
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:30.795
You see, this will question

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:36.670
“What is it that I have achieved?

00:23:37.087 --> 00:23:40.337
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:43.379
All these questions will come to you.

00:23:43.878 --> 00:23:45.920
But if you have faith,

00:23:46.379 --> 00:23:48.753
not the blind but the enlightened

00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:51.712
which is established by many miracles in life,

00:23:52.087 --> 00:23:53.212
many things in life;

00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:56.379
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

00:23:56.712 --> 00:23:57.920
small, small things.

00:23:58.254 --> 00:24:00.337
There have been miracles even in big things,

00:24:00.712 --> 00:24:04.462
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:06.504
So now you know, very well settled,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.421
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:10.753 --> 00:24:13.504
For example, it starts raining.

00:24:14.004 --> 00:24:17.087
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

00:24:17.504 --> 00:24:20.129
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

00:24:20.504 --> 00:24:21.712
nothing can happen.

00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:24.254
Let it rain as much as it likes.

00:24:24.628 --> 00:24:28.379
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

00:24:28.795 --> 00:24:30.462
it’s not going to drench us.

00:24:30.795 --> 00:24:35.962
In the same way this faith within us

00:24:36.337 --> 00:24:40.045
has to be absolutely solid,

00:24:40.795 --> 00:24:44.712
and that makes you extremely strong

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.587
and makes you responsible

00:24:47.962 --> 00:24:50.212
for the resurrection of thousands

00:24:50.546 --> 00:24:55.004
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

00:25:00.421 --> 00:25:04.421
This kind of life that we have

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:11.504
– that only by our own establishment,

00:25:11.962 --> 00:25:15.587
by our own understanding,

00:25:16.045 --> 00:25:21.628
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.212
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:29.795
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

00:25:30.212 --> 00:25:34.379
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

00:25:34.878 --> 00:25:39.004
You all should have the chance

00:25:39.586 --> 00:25:43.170
to know your spirit

00:25:43.628 --> 00:25:47.795
and to know yourself.

00:25:48.586 --> 00:25:51.254
So one has to have faith in oneself.

00:25:51.712 --> 00:25:53.920
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

00:25:54.337 --> 00:25:57.296
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

00:25:57.628 --> 00:26:01.670
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:08.753
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

00:26:09.628 --> 00:26:12.379
What do you want?

00:26:12.795 --> 00:26:17.045
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

00:26:19.004 --> 00:26:21.004
even if you don’t ask.

00:26:21.462 --> 00:26:26.962
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:30.878
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

00:26:31.379 --> 00:26:33.920
because this all-pervading Power

00:26:34.462 --> 00:26:36.045
is the only real power,

00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:39.337
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:46.920
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:54.670
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:59.337
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

00:26:59.753 --> 00:27:01.421
and he was deceived by someone

00:27:01.837 --> 00:27:04.254
and made him buy a land and a house

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.586
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:09.962
And this fellow said,

00:27:10.254 --> 00:27:11.795
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.878
they will not say anything to you.”

00:27:14.212 --> 00:27:16.586
He believed him – had wrong faith,

00:27:16.878 --> 00:27:20.587
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:26.462
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

00:27:28.586 --> 00:27:33.421
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

00:27:36.212 --> 00:27:39.920
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

00:27:40.337 --> 00:27:43.254
and so many people came and saw all this.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:47.795
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

00:27:48.212 --> 00:27:49.462
he could not understand,

00:27:49.878 --> 00:27:51.462
“Why it has happened to me

00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:55.837
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

00:27:57.628 --> 00:27:59.504
And he was deceived and he was,

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.504
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.670
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

00:28:07.212 --> 00:28:10.504
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

00:28:10.878 --> 00:28:17.087
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

00:28:18.837 --> 00:28:23.129
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

00:28:23.546 --> 00:28:26.628
That’s all – “Have faith.”

00:28:27.254 --> 00:28:29.337
And what a miraculous thing happened,

00:28:29.712 --> 00:28:34.462
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

00:28:37.586 --> 00:28:39.421
And that fellow said,

00:28:39.878 --> 00:28:42.837
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

00:28:43.296 --> 00:28:46.254
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:50.504
that I want to pay.”

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:56.795
It’s something unbelievable.

00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:02.421
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

00:29:02.795 --> 00:29:07.004
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

00:29:07.296 --> 00:29:10.129
Nothing worked out, nothing

00:29:10.628 --> 00:29:12.628
– only his faith.

00:29:13.087 --> 00:29:16.753
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:18.712
He was supposed to go to jail,

00:29:19.087 --> 00:29:20.379
now he’s going to become a rich man.

00:29:20.753 --> 00:29:23.170
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:25.170
This is just the financial side of it,

00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:26.379
but I know you know

00:29:26.712 --> 00:29:28.628
that there are so many other miracles happening.

00:29:29.129 --> 00:29:33.254
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.087
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

00:29:37.586 --> 00:29:41.170
After realization at least you should take to faith.

00:29:41.837 --> 00:29:44.504
That really is something surprising

00:29:44.837 --> 00:29:46.920
that people get their realization and everything,

00:29:47.379 --> 00:29:51.670
still they do not have faith in themselves.

00:29:52.254 --> 00:29:57.504
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:02.878
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

00:30:03.254 --> 00:30:05.920
faith was part and parcel of His being.

00:30:06.421 --> 00:30:11.129
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

00:30:11.795 --> 00:30:14.712
Now we have to have it.

00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:18.962
We have to believe in ourselves.

00:30:19.628 --> 00:30:21.670
There’s so many incidents I can give you

00:30:22.212 --> 00:30:24.546
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

00:30:24.962 --> 00:30:28.962
where just the faith has helped.

00:30:30.212 --> 00:30:32.712
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

00:30:33.212 --> 00:30:35.379
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

00:30:35.753 --> 00:30:37.962
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

00:30:38.462 --> 00:30:42.129
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

00:30:42.421 --> 00:30:44.586
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

00:30:44.878 --> 00:30:46.212
She said it three times.

00:30:46.586 --> 00:30:48.546
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

00:30:48.878 --> 00:30:51.170
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

00:30:51.504 --> 00:30:53.254
She just got up, walked out.

00:30:53.628 --> 00:30:56.129
And then she started running all the way,

00:30:56.546 --> 00:30:58.504
and everybody started laughing.

00:30:58.837 --> 00:31:00.546
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.170
I said, “But see her faith!”

00:31:03.837 --> 00:31:09.712
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:17.045
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

00:31:18.212 --> 00:31:20.753
They have shown faith in that person.

00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:22.587
As I have told you always,

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.920
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

00:31:26.379 --> 00:31:28.004
One among hundred might deceive us

00:31:28.296 --> 00:31:29.795
doesn’t matter, we trust.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.920
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

00:31:34.337 --> 00:31:36.129
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

00:31:36.586 --> 00:31:39.421
But what about deities?

00:31:39.878 --> 00:31:42.753
You show faith in them and it works,

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.504
immediately they work out.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.170
Like Guido told Me that

00:31:46.546 --> 00:31:49.296
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

00:31:49.795 --> 00:31:51.462
for these two days.”

00:31:51.878 --> 00:31:55.962
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

00:31:57.212 --> 00:32:00.045
It disappeared.

00:32:00.504 --> 00:32:06.045
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.878
And when we talk of faith, you know,

00:32:13.712 --> 00:32:19.170
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

00:32:20.296 --> 00:32:25.004
which organizes, which knows everything,

00:32:25.546 --> 00:32:27.628
which is so intelligent, efficient

00:32:28.045 --> 00:32:29.586
– above all, it loves you.

00:32:29.962 --> 00:32:33.045
And then you show faith.

00:32:34.587 --> 00:32:41.712
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

00:32:42.962 --> 00:32:47.670
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

00:32:48.296 --> 00:32:49.587
They don’t feel then bad,

00:32:50.004 --> 00:32:52.712
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

00:32:53.087 --> 00:32:55.587
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

00:32:55.962 --> 00:32:59.045
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

00:32:59.462 --> 00:33:01.962
whether this thing happens or not.

00:33:02.462 --> 00:33:06.379
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

00:33:06.837 --> 00:33:08.045
Supposing you are lost on the way,

00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:11.712
know that it has to be that way.

00:33:12.546 --> 00:33:16.254
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

00:33:16.628 --> 00:33:18.170
He was to be crucified.

00:33:18.586 --> 00:33:20.004
He had to carry the cross,

00:33:20.462 --> 00:33:23.962
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

00:33:24.462 --> 00:33:26.379
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

00:33:26.712 --> 00:33:29.254
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:33.628
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.170
But this faith in Him gave Him

00:33:37.462 --> 00:33:42.670
such a tremendous powers.

00:33:44.087 --> 00:33:45.795
He could have done anything.

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:48.296
He could have killed all these people

00:33:48.587 --> 00:33:52.212
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

00:33:52.586 --> 00:33:54.546
Just one glance could have killed them.

00:33:54.962 --> 00:33:58.004
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

00:33:58.337 --> 00:33:59.546
He went through it.

00:33:59.878 --> 00:34:03.379
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

00:34:03.753 --> 00:34:06.587
He is the one who won everything.

00:34:07.296 --> 00:34:09.129
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

00:34:09.504 --> 00:34:11.337
has to look at one’s own life.

00:34:11.753 --> 00:34:18.129
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

00:34:19.045 --> 00:34:23.170
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.586
In the evolutionary process

00:34:26.004 --> 00:34:29.546
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:36.379
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

00:34:36.878 --> 00:34:39.421
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

00:34:39.837 --> 00:34:42.587
most of the people are not going to be there.

00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:44.504
Not that we are not available,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:50.586
but because they are not fated

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:52.837
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.462
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:55.837 --> 00:34:57.379
So, you are so fortunate

00:34:57.753 --> 00:35:01.628
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

00:35:02.004 --> 00:35:05.004
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:09.837
in your resurrection that is your being now.

00:35:10.337 --> 00:35:13.379
And with that you will know how precious

00:35:13.753 --> 00:35:16.546
you are for the whole world,

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.045
and that what you have to do is not

00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:22.129
to think of material gains, physical gains

00:35:22.586 --> 00:35:27.837
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

00:35:28.712 --> 00:35:33.254
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

00:35:33.753 --> 00:35:35.795
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.421
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

00:35:38.795 --> 00:35:39.878
everything works out,

00:35:40.379 --> 00:35:44.045
everything in its own time shows its own results.

00:35:46.212 --> 00:35:50.004
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

00:35:50.504 --> 00:35:55.546
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

00:35:58.587 --> 00:36:04.504
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

00:36:04.837 --> 00:36:06.337
“All right, Mother says so.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.878
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

00:36:10.462 --> 00:36:12.129
Like the other day I had a journalist,

00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:15.546
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:16.920
I said, “Why?”

00:36:17.254 --> 00:36:21.587
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

00:36:22.004 --> 00:36:23.962
How can there be a blind child,

00:36:24.254 --> 00:36:26.753
how can this and how can that?”

00:36:27.212 --> 00:36:29.670
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

00:36:29.962 --> 00:36:31.795
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

00:36:32.212 --> 00:36:35.504
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

00:36:35.753 --> 00:36:40.795
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:45.670
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.504
So the situation is explainable;

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:55.379
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

00:36:56.087 --> 00:36:59.837
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

00:37:00.254 --> 00:37:02.129
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:06.546
have you any problems? None.”

00:37:09.379 --> 00:37:11.587
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

00:37:12.004 --> 00:37:15.795
Now if you say that there is a way out

00:37:16.254 --> 00:37:19.254
and that there is a solution,

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.712
and that a time can come

00:37:23.045 --> 00:37:25.962
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

00:37:26.379 --> 00:37:29.753
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

00:37:31.586 --> 00:37:33.254
so why not see this?

00:37:33.628 --> 00:37:37.337
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

00:37:38.628 --> 00:37:42.586
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

00:37:44.254 --> 00:37:46.421
So this kind of negative attitude

00:37:46.795 --> 00:37:48.920
also Sahaja yogis can have.

00:37:49.379 --> 00:37:51.628
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

00:37:52.087 --> 00:37:54.586
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

00:37:54.878 --> 00:37:58.129
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:03.129
You can cure, your faith can cure.

00:38:03.628 --> 00:38:06.462
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

00:38:06.837 --> 00:38:08.087
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:12.212
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

00:38:12.586 --> 00:38:14.837
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

00:38:15.337 --> 00:38:19.753
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.962
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

00:38:23.421 --> 00:38:26.170
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:28.670
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

00:38:29.087 --> 00:38:30.546
Third day he was out of hospital,

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:33.004
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:37.004
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:39.628
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

00:38:40.004 --> 00:38:42.296
the deities have to work it out.

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:45.920
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

00:38:46.462 --> 00:38:49.296
It’s the deities who stood by it.

00:38:53.254 --> 00:38:59.712
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:06.504
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

00:39:07.254 --> 00:39:10.753
Why not we develop that complete faith

00:39:11.254 --> 00:39:13.129
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

00:39:13.546 --> 00:39:16.504
we are in the Kingdom of God,

00:39:17.004 --> 00:39:21.254
and that this Power is going to look after us?

00:39:21.795 --> 00:39:24.379
Then we’ll have no choices,

00:39:24.837 --> 00:39:30.712
we’ll have no hesitation.

00:39:31.587 --> 00:39:35.129
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

00:39:35.546 --> 00:39:38.004
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

00:39:38.421 --> 00:39:40.586
or go anywhere – so what?

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:44.254
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

00:39:44.628 --> 00:39:47.254
it’s perfectly all right.

00:39:47.795 --> 00:39:50.170
And no worry of any kind.

00:39:50.587 --> 00:39:53.129
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

00:39:53.462 --> 00:39:55.878
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

00:39:56.254 --> 00:39:58.004
Everything drops out.

00:39:58.421 --> 00:39:59.712
Doesn’t matter.

00:40:00.129 --> 00:40:03.004
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

00:40:03.462 --> 00:40:07.254
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:08.670
Like people tell Me,

00:40:09.004 --> 00:40:10.379
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:13.504
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

00:40:13.753 --> 00:40:16.337
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

00:40:16.795 --> 00:40:17.920
only the seat is changed.

00:40:18.337 --> 00:40:20.587
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

00:40:20.962 --> 00:40:25.712
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:33.296
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

00:40:33.837 --> 00:40:36.379
then you don’t bother.

00:40:36.837 --> 00:40:39.296
Many people will find out whether

00:40:39.628 --> 00:40:42.045
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

00:40:42.421 --> 00:40:46.962
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

00:40:49.462 --> 00:40:51.878
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

00:40:52.296 --> 00:40:55.920
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

00:40:56.421 --> 00:40:59.296
Nothing can bind you,

00:40:59.753 --> 00:41:01.504
nothing can pull you down,

00:41:01.837 --> 00:41:05.670
no habit can come back on you;

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:12.962
because faith will purify you completely,

00:41:13.546 --> 00:41:16.587
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

00:41:17.087 --> 00:41:20.878
This faith is not something

00:41:21.337 --> 00:41:22.962
that can be put into your heads

00:41:23.379 --> 00:41:26.962
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:32.504
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

00:41:33.212 --> 00:41:38.212
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:38.837 --> 00:41:43.421
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

00:41:44.546 --> 00:41:46.546
would be established,

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:48.712
would be effective,

00:41:49.129 --> 00:41:54.504
and for the whole world will be a model.

00:41:56.087 --> 00:41:59.670
May God bless you all.
