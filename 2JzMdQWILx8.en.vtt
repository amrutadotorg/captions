WEBVTT

00:05.004 --> 00:07.837
We all have today gathered here

00:08.170 --> 00:11.753
on top of this beautiful mountain,

00:13.546 --> 00:17.170
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:18.546 --> 00:22.129
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

00:22.586 --> 00:28.546
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

00:30.421 --> 00:32.920
by which He showed

00:33.254 --> 00:36.586
that the spirit does not die.

00:37.586 --> 00:41.379
He was – He was the Omkara,

00:41.670 --> 00:46.129
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

00:46.920 --> 00:52.296
and that is why He could walk on the water.

00:53.421 --> 00:58.170
And also now we have made a film

00:58.712 --> 01:03.753
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

01:04.045 --> 01:07.296
which shows the carbon atom,

01:07.837 --> 01:11.586
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

01:11.962 --> 01:15.546
you find a proper swastika there;

01:15.837 --> 01:21.296
and left to the right we see Omkara.

01:21.628 --> 01:24.296
But when you see from down below upward,

01:24.586 --> 01:28.296
what you see is alpha and omega.

01:28.878 --> 01:33.170
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

01:33.504 --> 01:36.837
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

01:37.212 --> 01:43.712
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

01:44.753 --> 01:48.087
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

01:48.462 --> 01:54.087
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

01:55.546 --> 01:59.045
I don’t know at the time of Christ

01:59.421 --> 02:03.212
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

02:03.586 --> 02:05.837
but definitely to Him

02:06.254 --> 02:10.962
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

02:18.712 --> 02:24.004
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

02:24.587 --> 02:29.712
and very important for our ascent.

02:31.254 --> 02:34.628
If He had not resurrected Himself,

02:35.045 --> 02:39.170
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

02:39.795 --> 02:42.587
So it’s a great contribution.

02:43.087 --> 02:47.837
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

02:48.712 --> 02:51.795
what you were before

02:52.170 --> 02:55.379
and what you are today.

02:58.337 --> 03:01.296
It is such a change,

03:01.712 --> 03:03.837
such a difference,

03:04.129 --> 03:07.087
such a transformation.

03:07.962 --> 03:11.546
It is His own sacrifice

03:12.004 --> 03:13.462
on the cross

03:13.712 --> 03:17.462
and His own

03:17.920 --> 03:20.504
beautiful resurrection

03:20.795 --> 03:24.004
has created a way for all of us

03:24.337 --> 03:29.586
to get into this new transformed state.

03:34.296 --> 03:40.212
In this state is a different story for human beings,

03:40.586 --> 03:43.045
and a different for Christ.

03:43.379 --> 03:45.462
Christ was Himself

03:45.795 --> 03:49.962
was holiness, was purity.

03:51.421 --> 03:53.920
So His resurrection

03:54.212 --> 04:00.670
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

04:02.296 --> 04:06.170
because He did not need transformation,

04:07.795 --> 04:09.753
He did not

04:10.045 --> 04:14.546
have to go through any cleansing.

04:16.004 --> 04:19.337
But what happened in His case

04:20.004 --> 04:25.129
was that He became

04:26.586 --> 04:29.795
resurrected from death

04:30.296 --> 04:34.837
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

04:35.212 --> 04:37.795
is like a death;

04:38.170 --> 04:40.170
because they do everything

04:40.546 --> 04:46.129
without any understanding about the totality,

04:47.337 --> 04:49.504
about the reality,

04:49.837 --> 04:52.878
about the absolute truth.

04:53.212 --> 04:55.462
Whatever they do ultimately

04:55.878 --> 04:59.962
takes them to their destruction.

05:01.628 --> 05:04.962
Even the religions which are established

05:05.337 --> 05:07.421
by these great incarnations

05:07.795 --> 05:12.212
are absolutely on a decline.

05:12.587 --> 05:16.587
You do not find any trace of religious life

05:17.004 --> 05:18.504
with all those people

05:18.837 --> 05:21.712
who claim that they are the ones

05:22.045 --> 05:25.837
who can represent those incarnations.

05:26.546 --> 05:29.587
If you see in a subtle way

05:30.004 --> 05:31.920
it’s very painful also,

05:32.296 --> 05:36.421
that in the name of all these great incarnations

05:36.795 --> 05:39.337
the kind of work people are doing,

05:39.753 --> 05:44.296
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

05:44.628 --> 05:47.586
because they have no fear of God.

05:47.962 --> 05:51.087
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

05:51.379 --> 05:53.087
all over the world.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.504
Of course here,

05:54.795 --> 05:56.712
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

05:57.045 --> 05:58.962
Everywhere people are seeing

05:59.379 --> 06:02.628
all these false things have been exposed.

06:03.004 --> 06:06.878
But these false things they have used

06:07.421 --> 06:11.337
under a garb of God,

06:11.628 --> 06:14.546
spirituality and beauty.

06:14.962 --> 06:18.170
That’s the best way you can hide.

06:19.212 --> 06:23.670
All the cruelty, all the violence,

06:24.587 --> 06:27.504
all the ugliness

06:28.421 --> 06:30.837
– this is how they have worked it out.

06:31.212 --> 06:34.920
And it has gone into such a state

06:35.337 --> 06:38.337
that you do not find the slightest

06:38.753 --> 06:43.212
even tinge of religious life among these people.

06:43.712 --> 06:45.628
Like all the thieves of the world,

06:45.962 --> 06:47.920
all the great crooks of the world

06:48.337 --> 06:51.920
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

06:54.170 --> 06:58.462
It’s only because what was written in all the books

06:58.795 --> 07:02.628
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

07:03.129 --> 07:05.587
was never done.

07:07.129 --> 07:10.586
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

07:10.962 --> 07:14.421
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

07:14.837 --> 07:17.212
He also said that “You are to be born again”

07:17.628 --> 07:20.504
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

07:20.878 --> 07:26.337
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.628
But they don’t think that actually

07:31.004 --> 07:33.587
what benevolence it has given them.

07:34.004 --> 07:35.837
At the most they might have made some money,

07:36.254 --> 07:39.628
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

07:40.004 --> 07:46.004
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

07:48.504 --> 07:52.753
One must pity their insanity,

07:53.504 --> 07:57.212
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

07:57.586 --> 07:59.129
or to anybody else’s life

07:59.504 --> 08:03.837
of such a noble and a higher value system,

08:04.296 --> 08:10.337
and are doing all very low-graded things.

08:12.296 --> 08:17.504
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

08:18.087 --> 08:21.670
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

08:22.337 --> 08:26.379
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

08:26.753 --> 08:31.379
that you are coming from that environment,

08:32.462 --> 08:34.586
that style of life,

08:34.962 --> 08:37.212
that kind of thinking

08:37.586 --> 08:39.795
which was all for your destruction.

08:40.170 --> 08:44.462
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

08:44.962 --> 08:47.504
So when you’re coming out of it,

08:47.962 --> 08:50.962
still these things hang over,

08:51.379 --> 08:56.337
still you get affected by them.

08:56.878 --> 08:59.546
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

08:59.837 --> 09:03.129
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

09:03.462 --> 09:06.004
to some sort of a funny situation,

09:06.337 --> 09:11.795
to some sort of a degrading things.

09:12.421 --> 09:15.254
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

09:15.628 --> 09:18.504
sometimes you accept all that.

09:18.962 --> 09:21.296
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

09:21.586 --> 09:23.379
that after coming to realization

09:23.795 --> 09:26.795
he has to be very introspective.

09:27.212 --> 09:29.045
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

09:29.379 --> 09:33.170
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

09:33.712 --> 09:37.920
It’s very important that you have to know

09:38.337 --> 09:42.254
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.129
Because Christ did not need this,

09:47.753 --> 09:51.462
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

09:51.962 --> 09:58.296
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

09:59.170 --> 10:05.462
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

10:05.795 --> 10:08.129
on the sense that from He died

10:08.586 --> 10:11.628
and then He resurrected Himself.

10:12.087 --> 10:15.337
But for us it is very different.

10:15.753 --> 10:18.753
We are now Sahaja yogis,

10:19.129 --> 10:22.628
but we were ordinary human beings.

10:23.045 --> 10:25.504
We had no light within us.

10:25.878 --> 10:27.920
Now the light comes within us

10:28.296 --> 10:30.586
and we see the light,

10:30.920 --> 10:34.296
then what do we become?

10:34.670 --> 10:38.170
We have to become the light itself.

10:38.712 --> 10:40.337
Christ was the light.

10:40.712 --> 10:42.254
He did not have to become.

10:42.587 --> 10:44.587
So we have to become the light.

10:44.878 --> 10:48.795
And now you have to guard on

10:49.670 --> 10:53.254
the way this light might get disturbed,

10:53.587 --> 10:58.920
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

11:00.587 --> 11:05.045
So carrying on yourself with this light,

11:05.379 --> 11:07.753
first thing you should know that

11:08.170 --> 11:10.421
if you see the light, is not proper

11:10.753 --> 11:12.087
– means you are not the light.

11:12.462 --> 11:15.920
You have to become the light.

11:17.212 --> 11:18.753
When you are the light,

11:19.212 --> 11:21.795
then in that light you can easily see

11:22.129 --> 11:24.628
how your mind works,

11:25.129 --> 11:27.212
what ideas it gives,

11:27.587 --> 11:34.129
what affects your mind

11:34.837 --> 11:36.795
while you’re ascending.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.045
Is this the worry

11:39.337 --> 11:44.837
or is this the responsibility that you have?

11:45.212 --> 11:49.462
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

11:49.878 --> 11:51.628
that there is an impediment

11:52.004 --> 11:57.129
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

11:57.837 --> 12:00.586
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

12:00.962 --> 12:05.962
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

12:07.462 --> 12:10.462
It’s a very beautiful journey

12:10.837 --> 12:12.546
– very, very beautiful journey.

12:13.004 --> 12:15.212
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

12:15.586 --> 12:20.212
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

12:21.379 --> 12:26.462
the journey of kundalini.

12:28.546 --> 12:36.170
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

12:37.837 --> 12:42.546
Basically you were not a realized soul,

12:43.129 --> 12:45.795
but now you are a realized soul.

12:46.296 --> 12:48.170
You are a evolved state.

12:48.628 --> 12:54.379
Now what is missing is the idea

12:54.837 --> 12:59.795
that we are absolutely all right

13:00.296 --> 13:04.587
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

13:06.004 --> 13:10.628
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

13:11.129 --> 13:13.795
it’s not going to help you at all.

13:14.296 --> 13:17.296
What you have to do is to

13:18.087 --> 13:19.920
all the time introspect yourself.

13:20.337 --> 13:22.504
That’s what is meditation for,

13:22.878 --> 13:24.421
to see for yourself

13:24.753 --> 13:28.878
how you are keeping up

13:29.379 --> 13:32.546
your spiritual ascent.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.462
No one else can do it,

13:34.878 --> 13:37.296
it’s your own individual work.

13:37.586 --> 13:39.546
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

13:39.795 --> 13:42.587
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

13:42.962 --> 13:46.712
They may not say, they may not refer it,

13:47.129 --> 13:48.586
but they will know definitely

13:48.962 --> 13:50.712
that such-and-such chakra is catching

13:51.129 --> 13:53.045
and this person has this problem.

13:53.462 --> 13:58.170
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

13:59.712 --> 14:02.670
what is their problem is.

14:03.212 --> 14:05.129
So if somebody tells you

14:05.504 --> 14:07.379
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

14:07.670 --> 14:10.379
you should never, never feel bad about it,

14:10.712 --> 14:13.421
because by keeping that chakra intact

14:13.712 --> 14:16.628
you are ruining your own life.

14:17.129 --> 14:19.586
So what you have to do is to see

14:19.962 --> 14:21.712
that if somebody tells you that

14:22.087 --> 14:26.004
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

14:26.379 --> 14:28.962
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

14:29.379 --> 14:31.962
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

14:32.337 --> 14:34.504
there’s something wrong with your face,

14:34.795 --> 14:36.212
you can immediately correct it.

14:36.586 --> 14:40.212
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

14:40.587 --> 14:44.004
you have to be mature enough that you should know

14:44.337 --> 14:46.004
that it is a great blessing

14:46.421 --> 14:49.504
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

14:50.504 --> 14:52.170
Like the other day there was some quarrel

14:52.504 --> 14:53.920
between the two leaders.

14:54.296 --> 14:56.753
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

14:57.045 --> 14:58.337
There should not be.

14:58.546 --> 15:02.129
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

15:02.504 --> 15:03.795
two legs do not fight.

15:04.170 --> 15:07.087
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

15:07.504 --> 15:11.628
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

15:12.421 --> 15:15.212
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

15:15.586 --> 15:20.170
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.212
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.878
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

15:27.296 --> 15:28.878
When he puts his hand towards Me,

15:29.296 --> 15:32.170
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

15:32.504 --> 15:34.712
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

15:35.087 --> 15:38.920
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

15:39.296 --> 15:41.421
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

15:41.753 --> 15:45.462
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

15:46.296 --> 15:51.546
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

15:51.920 --> 15:54.462
because I said it to him.

15:55.087 --> 15:58.045
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

15:58.546 --> 16:00.379
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

16:00.795 --> 16:01.837
what is good for him.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.587
He did not feel bad at all.

16:03.962 --> 16:06.087
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

16:06.462 --> 16:09.254
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

16:09.628 --> 16:14.004
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

16:21.004 --> 16:24.587
Now, the problem with us is that

16:24.920 --> 16:29.212
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

16:30.296 --> 16:32.712
and we have consolidated it.

16:33.212 --> 16:35.212
Also, we have a great collective force,

16:35.587 --> 16:38.087
I can see, in every country.

16:38.546 --> 16:41.254
We can give realizations to so many,

16:41.712 --> 16:44.254
and we can really establish

16:44.670 --> 16:49.379
all these great truths in our lives.

16:49.795 --> 16:51.212
We can do it.

16:51.546 --> 16:55.087
All the time we should establish them.

16:55.878 --> 16:59.254
But there is one point

16:59.628 --> 17:02.712
on which one should not be very sure:

17:03.170 --> 17:09.337
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

17:10.337 --> 17:13.004
You have to be careful on this point very much.

17:13.421 --> 17:19.212
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

17:19.587 --> 17:24.296
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

17:25.379 --> 17:28.712
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

17:29.254 --> 17:32.504
The reason is that they have no faith

17:32.878 --> 17:39.462
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

17:40.753 --> 17:43.546
This is the faith which is missing.

17:44.129 --> 17:48.753
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

17:49.337 --> 17:53.712
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

17:55.462 --> 18:02.045
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

18:04.962 --> 18:09.753
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

18:10.087 --> 18:11.878
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

18:12.212 --> 18:14.296
– you have known that it is so.

18:14.628 --> 18:16.296
But even knowing that,

18:16.628 --> 18:20.129
it has not become such a faith within you.

18:20.587 --> 18:24.379
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

18:24.795 --> 18:27.254
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

18:27.586 --> 18:29.087
not the blind faith.

18:29.504 --> 18:32.920
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

18:33.462 --> 18:37.462
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

18:37.753 --> 18:42.712
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

18:43.170 --> 18:45.337
There cannot be any problems

18:45.712 --> 18:49.170
if your faith is enlightened.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.837
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

18:53.254 --> 18:56.670
many people who are very steady,

18:58.586 --> 19:01.587
who are upright,

19:02.212 --> 19:04.462
who are very valuable.

19:05.004 --> 19:06.795
They are like the people

19:07.170 --> 19:10.337
who know they are standing on the rocks.

19:10.878 --> 19:14.920
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

19:15.212 --> 19:18.337
they think they are still dwindling

19:18.712 --> 19:24.421
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

19:26.546 --> 19:30.628
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

19:31.087 --> 19:35.254
and also that has come out of faith

19:35.587 --> 19:38.753
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

19:39.212 --> 19:41.753
nothing can trouble us.

19:42.296 --> 19:45.587
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

19:46.004 --> 19:47.670
I mean, He knew everything,

19:48.045 --> 19:50.087
so He was sure about it.

19:50.586 --> 19:54.254
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

19:54.753 --> 19:58.296
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

19:58.712 --> 20:01.337
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

20:01.753 --> 20:04.504
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

20:04.878 --> 20:06.753
It is so.

20:07.212 --> 20:11.421
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

20:11.878 --> 20:15.254
while the other people,

20:17.962 --> 20:19.878
even Sahaja yogis,

20:20.254 --> 20:23.546
have to become like Christ

20:23.878 --> 20:26.795
as far as the faith is concerned.

20:27.379 --> 20:31.753
This faith is to be understood.

20:32.628 --> 20:35.379
This is an enlightened faith.

20:35.795 --> 20:40.087
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

20:40.504 --> 20:42.962
He went into all kinds of things,

20:43.421 --> 20:47.379
just because He knew it was just a drama

20:47.712 --> 20:52.004
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

20:52.462 --> 20:55.753
and there’s nothing serious,

20:56.712 --> 20:57.920
nothing is going to matter,

20:58.254 --> 20:59.753
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

21:00.129 --> 21:02.379
He played the drama.

21:02.878 --> 21:06.337
To Him it was nothing very serious.

21:08.753 --> 21:12.586
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

21:13.212 --> 21:17.337
He also in His heart knew everything that

21:17.712 --> 21:21.712
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

21:22.421 --> 21:26.586
But at the same time,

21:27.587 --> 21:30.504
He was the embodiment of faith:

21:31.004 --> 21:35.504
faith in Himself

21:35.837 --> 21:39.586
and in this all-pervading Power.

21:41.004 --> 21:43.296
This never lets you down,

21:43.753 --> 21:48.670
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

21:49.379 --> 21:54.129
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

21:55.379 --> 21:59.462
naturally I will give him all the work,

22:00.045 --> 22:02.379
I will trust everything,

22:02.795 --> 22:05.712
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

22:06.045 --> 22:09.337
never doubt such a person.

22:10.504 --> 22:15.753
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

22:16.421 --> 22:23.212
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

22:24.004 --> 22:28.129
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

22:29.920 --> 22:31.712
how life will improve

22:32.170 --> 22:37.296
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

22:37.837 --> 22:40.129
You’ll have no doubts,

22:40.504 --> 22:45.254
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

22:47.878 --> 22:52.045
So, this is such a state

22:52.586 --> 22:54.296
– only with faith.

22:54.795 --> 22:57.546
But now this faith, how do you get?

22:57.962 --> 23:02.129
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

23:02.504 --> 23:03.920
There’s no course about it,

23:04.337 --> 23:06.129
there’s no literature about it,

23:06.504 --> 23:08.753
there’s no lecture about it.

23:09.170 --> 23:14.628
But there is an awakening within you

23:15.087 --> 23:19.129
which will ask this

23:19.712 --> 23:22.170
“What am I?” – this awakening,

23:22.546 --> 23:24.962
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

23:25.337 --> 23:30.795
You see, this will question

23:32.878 --> 23:36.670
“What is it that I have achieved?

23:37.087 --> 23:40.337
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

23:40.795 --> 23:43.379
All these questions will come to you.

23:43.878 --> 23:45.920
But if you have faith,

23:46.379 --> 23:48.753
not the blind but the enlightened

23:49.212 --> 23:51.712
which is established by many miracles in life,

23:52.087 --> 23:53.212
many things in life;

23:53.586 --> 23:56.379
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

23:56.712 --> 23:57.920
small, small things.

23:58.254 --> 24:00.337
There have been miracles even in big things,

24:00.712 --> 24:04.462
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.504
So now you know, very well settled,

24:06.920 --> 24:10.421
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

24:10.753 --> 24:13.504
For example, it starts raining.

24:14.004 --> 24:17.087
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

24:17.504 --> 24:20.129
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

24:20.504 --> 24:21.712
nothing can happen.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.254
Let it rain as much as it likes.

24:24.628 --> 24:28.379
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

24:28.795 --> 24:30.462
it’s not going to drench us.

24:30.795 --> 24:35.962
In the same way this faith within us

24:36.337 --> 24:40.045
has to be absolutely solid,

24:40.795 --> 24:44.712
and that makes you extremely strong

24:45.170 --> 24:47.587
and makes you responsible

24:47.962 --> 24:50.212
for the resurrection of thousands

24:50.546 --> 24:55.004
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

25:00.421 --> 25:04.421
This kind of life that we have

25:05.837 --> 25:11.504
– that only by our own establishment,

25:11.962 --> 25:15.587
by our own understanding,

25:16.045 --> 25:21.628
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

25:22.670 --> 25:25.212
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

25:26.421 --> 25:29.795
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

25:30.212 --> 25:34.379
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

25:34.878 --> 25:39.004
You all should have the chance

25:39.586 --> 25:43.170
to know your spirit

25:43.628 --> 25:47.795
and to know yourself.

25:48.586 --> 25:51.254
So one has to have faith in oneself.

25:51.712 --> 25:53.920
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

25:54.337 --> 25:57.296
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

25:57.628 --> 26:01.670
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

26:04.920 --> 26:08.753
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

26:09.628 --> 26:12.379
What do you want?

26:12.795 --> 26:17.045
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

26:19.004 --> 26:21.004
even if you don’t ask.

26:21.462 --> 26:26.962
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

26:27.546 --> 26:30.878
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

26:31.379 --> 26:33.920
because this all-pervading Power

26:34.462 --> 26:36.045
is the only real power,

26:36.421 --> 26:39.337
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

26:40.170 --> 26:46.920
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

26:47.587 --> 26:54.670
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

26:56.045 --> 26:59.337
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

26:59.753 --> 27:01.421
and he was deceived by someone

27:01.837 --> 27:04.254
and made him buy a land and a house

27:04.670 --> 27:08.586
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

27:09.045 --> 27:09.962
And this fellow said,

27:10.254 --> 27:11.795
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

27:12.170 --> 27:13.878
they will not say anything to you.”

27:14.212 --> 27:16.586
He believed him – had wrong faith,

27:16.878 --> 27:20.587
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

27:20.920 --> 27:26.462
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

27:28.586 --> 27:33.421
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

27:36.212 --> 27:39.920
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

27:40.337 --> 27:43.254
and so many people came and saw all this.

27:43.670 --> 27:47.795
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

27:48.212 --> 27:49.462
he could not understand,

27:49.878 --> 27:51.462
“Why it has happened to me

27:51.878 --> 27:55.837
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

27:57.628 --> 27:59.504
And he was deceived and he was,

28:00.170 --> 28:02.504
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

28:02.920 --> 28:06.670
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

28:07.212 --> 28:10.504
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

28:10.878 --> 28:17.087
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

28:18.837 --> 28:23.129
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

28:23.546 --> 28:26.628
That’s all – “Have faith.”

28:27.254 --> 28:29.337
And what a miraculous thing happened,

28:29.712 --> 28:34.462
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

28:37.586 --> 28:39.421
And that fellow said,

28:39.878 --> 28:42.837
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

28:43.296 --> 28:46.254
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

28:46.670 --> 28:50.504
that I want to pay.”

28:51.670 --> 28:56.795
It’s something unbelievable.

28:59.004 --> 29:02.421
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

29:02.795 --> 29:07.004
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

29:07.296 --> 29:10.129
Nothing worked out, nothing

29:10.628 --> 29:12.628
– only his faith.

29:13.087 --> 29:16.753
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

29:17.421 --> 29:18.712
He was supposed to go to jail,

29:19.087 --> 29:20.379
now he’s going to become a rich man.

29:20.753 --> 29:23.170
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.170
This is just the financial side of it,

29:25.546 --> 29:26.379
but I know you know

29:26.712 --> 29:28.628
that there are so many other miracles happening.

29:29.129 --> 29:33.254
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

29:33.670 --> 29:37.087
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

29:37.586 --> 29:41.170
After realization at least you should take to faith.

29:41.837 --> 29:44.504
That really is something surprising

29:44.837 --> 29:46.920
that people get their realization and everything,

29:47.379 --> 29:51.670
still they do not have faith in themselves.

29:52.254 --> 29:57.504
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

29:58.296 --> 30:02.878
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

30:03.254 --> 30:05.920
faith was part and parcel of His being.

30:06.421 --> 30:11.129
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

30:11.795 --> 30:14.712
Now we have to have it.

30:15.296 --> 30:18.962
We have to believe in ourselves.

30:19.628 --> 30:21.670
There’s so many incidents I can give you

30:22.212 --> 30:24.546
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

30:24.962 --> 30:28.962
where just the faith has helped.

30:30.212 --> 30:32.712
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

30:33.212 --> 30:35.379
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

30:35.753 --> 30:37.962
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

30:38.462 --> 30:42.129
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

30:42.421 --> 30:44.586
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

30:44.878 --> 30:46.212
She said it three times.

30:46.586 --> 30:48.546
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

30:48.878 --> 30:51.170
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

30:51.504 --> 30:53.254
She just got up, walked out.

30:53.628 --> 30:56.129
And then she started running all the way,

30:56.546 --> 30:58.504
and everybody started laughing.

30:58.837 --> 31:00.546
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

31:00.920 --> 31:03.170
I said, “But see her faith!”

31:03.837 --> 31:09.712
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

31:10.670 --> 31:17.045
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

31:18.212 --> 31:20.753
They have shown faith in that person.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.587
As I have told you always,

31:22.920 --> 31:25.920
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

31:26.379 --> 31:28.004
One among hundred might deceive us

31:28.296 --> 31:29.795
doesn’t matter, we trust.

31:30.170 --> 31:33.920
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

31:34.337 --> 31:36.129
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

31:36.586 --> 31:39.421
But what about deities?

31:39.878 --> 31:42.753
You show faith in them and it works,

31:43.170 --> 31:44.504
immediately they work out.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.170
Like Guido told Me that

31:46.546 --> 31:49.296
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

31:49.795 --> 31:51.462
for these two days.”

31:51.878 --> 31:55.962
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

31:57.212 --> 32:00.045
It disappeared.

32:00.504 --> 32:06.045
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

32:08.670 --> 32:12.878
And when we talk of faith, you know,

32:13.712 --> 32:19.170
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

32:20.296 --> 32:25.004
which organizes, which knows everything,

32:25.546 --> 32:27.628
which is so intelligent, efficient

32:28.045 --> 32:29.586
– above all, it loves you.

32:29.962 --> 32:33.045
And then you show faith.

32:34.587 --> 32:41.712
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

32:42.962 --> 32:47.670
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

32:48.296 --> 32:49.587
They don’t feel then bad,

32:50.004 --> 32:52.712
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

32:53.087 --> 32:55.587
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

32:55.962 --> 32:59.045
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

32:59.462 --> 33:01.962
whether this thing happens or not.

33:02.462 --> 33:06.379
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

33:06.837 --> 33:08.045
Supposing you are lost on the way,

33:08.421 --> 33:11.712
know that it has to be that way.

33:12.546 --> 33:16.254
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

33:16.628 --> 33:18.170
He was to be crucified.

33:18.586 --> 33:20.004
He had to carry the cross,

33:20.462 --> 33:23.962
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

33:24.462 --> 33:26.379
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

33:26.712 --> 33:29.254
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

33:29.670 --> 33:33.628
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

33:34.170 --> 33:37.170
But this faith in Him gave Him

33:37.462 --> 33:42.670
such a tremendous powers.

33:44.087 --> 33:45.795
He could have done anything.

33:46.212 --> 33:48.296
He could have killed all these people

33:48.587 --> 33:52.212
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

33:52.586 --> 33:54.546
Just one glance could have killed them.

33:54.962 --> 33:58.004
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

33:58.337 --> 33:59.546
He went through it.

33:59.878 --> 34:03.379
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

34:03.753 --> 34:06.587
He is the one who won everything.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.129
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

34:09.504 --> 34:11.337
has to look at one’s own life.

34:11.753 --> 34:18.129
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

34:19.045 --> 34:23.170
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

34:23.670 --> 34:25.586
In the evolutionary process

34:26.004 --> 34:29.546
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

34:30.129 --> 34:36.379
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

34:36.878 --> 34:39.421
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

34:39.837 --> 34:42.587
most of the people are not going to be there.

34:43.045 --> 34:44.504
Not that we are not available,

34:44.920 --> 34:50.586
but because they are not fated

34:51.170 --> 34:52.837
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

34:53.170 --> 34:55.462
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

34:55.837 --> 34:57.379
So, you are so fortunate

34:57.753 --> 35:01.628
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

35:02.004 --> 35:05.004
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

35:05.421 --> 35:09.837
in your resurrection that is your being now.

35:10.337 --> 35:13.379
And with that you will know how precious

35:13.753 --> 35:16.546
you are for the whole world,

35:16.920 --> 35:19.045
and that what you have to do is not

35:19.379 --> 35:22.129
to think of material gains, physical gains

35:22.586 --> 35:27.837
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

35:28.712 --> 35:33.254
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

35:33.753 --> 35:35.795
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

35:36.170 --> 35:38.421
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

35:38.795 --> 35:39.878
everything works out,

35:40.379 --> 35:44.045
everything in its own time shows its own results.

35:46.212 --> 35:50.004
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

35:50.504 --> 35:55.546
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

35:58.587 --> 36:04.504
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

36:04.837 --> 36:06.337
“All right, Mother says so.

36:06.670 --> 36:09.878
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

36:10.462 --> 36:12.129
Like the other day I had a journalist,

36:12.587 --> 36:15.546
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

36:15.920 --> 36:16.920
I said, “Why?”

36:17.254 --> 36:21.587
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

36:22.004 --> 36:23.962
How can there be a blind child,

36:24.254 --> 36:26.753
how can this and how can that?”

36:27.212 --> 36:29.670
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

36:29.962 --> 36:31.795
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

36:32.212 --> 36:35.504
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

36:35.753 --> 36:40.795
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

36:41.170 --> 36:45.670
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

36:47.170 --> 36:50.504
So the situation is explainable;

36:50.920 --> 36:55.379
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

36:56.087 --> 36:59.837
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

37:00.254 --> 37:02.129
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

37:02.587 --> 37:06.546
have you any problems? None.”

37:09.379 --> 37:11.587
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

37:12.004 --> 37:15.795
Now if you say that there is a way out

37:16.254 --> 37:19.254
and that there is a solution,

37:19.670 --> 37:22.712
and that a time can come

37:23.045 --> 37:25.962
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

37:26.379 --> 37:29.753
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

37:31.586 --> 37:33.254
so why not see this?

37:33.628 --> 37:37.337
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

37:38.628 --> 37:42.586
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

37:44.254 --> 37:46.421
So this kind of negative attitude

37:46.795 --> 37:48.920
also Sahaja yogis can have.

37:49.379 --> 37:51.628
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

37:52.087 --> 37:54.586
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

37:54.878 --> 37:58.129
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

37:58.670 --> 38:03.129
You can cure, your faith can cure.

38:03.628 --> 38:06.462
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

38:06.837 --> 38:08.087
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

38:08.586 --> 38:12.212
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

38:12.586 --> 38:14.837
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

38:15.337 --> 38:19.753
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

38:20.170 --> 38:22.962
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

38:23.421 --> 38:26.170
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

38:26.504 --> 38:28.670
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

38:29.087 --> 38:30.546
Third day he was out of hospital,

38:30.795 --> 38:33.004
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

38:33.421 --> 38:37.004
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

38:37.421 --> 38:39.628
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

38:40.004 --> 38:42.296
the deities have to work it out.

38:42.753 --> 38:45.920
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

38:46.462 --> 38:49.296
It’s the deities who stood by it.

38:53.254 --> 38:59.712
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

39:00.504 --> 39:06.504
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

39:07.254 --> 39:10.753
Why not we develop that complete faith

39:11.254 --> 39:13.129
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

39:13.546 --> 39:16.504
we are in the Kingdom of God,

39:17.004 --> 39:21.254
and that this Power is going to look after us?

39:21.795 --> 39:24.379
Then we’ll have no choices,

39:24.837 --> 39:30.712
we’ll have no hesitation.

39:31.587 --> 39:35.129
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

39:35.546 --> 39:38.004
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

39:38.421 --> 39:40.586
or go anywhere – so what?

39:41.045 --> 39:44.254
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

39:44.628 --> 39:47.254
it’s perfectly all right.

39:47.795 --> 39:50.170
And no worry of any kind.

39:50.587 --> 39:53.129
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

39:53.462 --> 39:55.878
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

39:56.254 --> 39:58.004
Everything drops out.

39:58.421 --> 39:59.712
Doesn’t matter.

40:00.129 --> 40:03.004
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

40:03.462 --> 40:07.254
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

40:07.712 --> 40:08.670
Like people tell Me,

40:09.004 --> 40:10.379
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

40:10.712 --> 40:13.504
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

40:13.753 --> 40:16.337
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

40:16.795 --> 40:17.920
only the seat is changed.

40:18.337 --> 40:20.587
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

40:20.962 --> 40:25.712
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

40:27.170 --> 40:33.296
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

40:33.837 --> 40:36.379
then you don’t bother.

40:36.837 --> 40:39.296
Many people will find out whether

40:39.628 --> 40:42.045
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

40:42.421 --> 40:46.962
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

40:49.462 --> 40:51.878
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

40:52.296 --> 40:55.920
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.296
Nothing can bind you,

40:59.753 --> 41:01.504
nothing can pull you down,

41:01.837 --> 41:05.670
no habit can come back on you;

41:07.670 --> 41:12.962
because faith will purify you completely,

41:13.546 --> 41:16.587
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

41:17.087 --> 41:20.878
This faith is not something

41:21.337 --> 41:22.962
that can be put into your heads

41:23.379 --> 41:26.962
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

41:27.670 --> 41:32.504
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

41:33.212 --> 41:38.212
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

41:38.837 --> 41:43.421
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

41:44.546 --> 41:46.546
would be established,

41:47.004 --> 41:48.712
would be effective,

41:49.129 --> 41:54.504
and for the whole world will be a model.

41:56.087 --> 41:59.670
May God bless you all.
