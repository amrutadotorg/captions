00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:34.410
We have today come to this famous place, Hyderabad,
which was ruled by Muslim kings, but they

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:48.219
were very Indian and they fought also for
the independence of India with the British.

00:05:48.219 --> 00:06:10.450
You know about Tipu Sultan, who was also a
realized soul but he was killed.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:23.770
We have in our country one very big problem
and that is, individually we are all great

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:33.139
people, but when it comes to collective we
don’t know how to live collectively, and

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:43.419
that is why we lost our independence.

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.509
Anybody can manage us.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:07:00.029
If we can
open our eyes and see, it is quite easily

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:13.710
understood that when people try to talk ill
of others, involving us, there must be some

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.970
intention.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:31.460
This has been our failing since long, that
people use such methods that they spoil the

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:37.110
relationships.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:42.639
And this should not crawl into Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:55.300
When I am in India I think I should put some
light on our weaknesses also.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:02.680
The second weakness we have, that we are very
involved with our family; with our children,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.110
with our parents, with our brothers, cousins,
this, that.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:17.470
Till you are completely deceived or cheated
by someone so close, we never learn

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.089
a lesson.

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:25.870
We are very involved; all our problems are
around them.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.229
We cannot get out of our family.

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:38.090
All the time we start thinking that: “Sahaja
Yoga should help my family.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.779
Sahaja Yoga should do this for my family."

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:53.970
In Sahaja Yoga there’s another family that
has nothing to do with your family.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:01.040
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis who are of
a very high level, and suddenly I find they

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.600
have gone down.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:12.000
They have no reason to suffer in health or
in any way.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.199
Then I find out that they’re attached to
some brother or someone who is doing some

00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:28.070
other kind of guru business.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:36.600
Instead of we influencing them, they start
influencing us.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:47.950
So we have to really break our relationships
with all such people who are negative, because

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:53.670
we have had relations and relations and relations
all our lives.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.310
What did we get out of them?

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:08.360
If we do not understand how important it is
to be a Sahaja Yogi: that you are the instrument

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.870
of God Almighty.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:21.010
So many things you know that even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha did not know.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.850
They didn’t know much about Kundalini.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.610
They didn’t know how to raise the Kundalini.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.860
They didn’t know how to give Realization,
except for gurus.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.920
Out of them also you know that Janaka had
only one disciple.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:44.920
All of them had one each.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:52.920
So certain things you know are more than anybody
had known before.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.860
But still if you are sticking on to your old
standards and old methods and confusing them

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:08.050
with Sahaja Yoga, identifying with them as
Sahaja Yoga, then your growth will be very

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.730
little.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.630
So I have to tell you that, try to get out
of this.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.089
“Who is my brother?

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:24.020
Who is my sister?”

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:31.880
Of course it’s a good thing to be attached,
in a way, to the duties that you have to perform

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.790
towards everyone, but all the duties should
be done in such a manner that you do not get

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.250
involved into it.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:47.270
It is very important that you should not get
involved with those duties.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:59.079
Whatever has to be done you should do, but
you shouldn’t worry as to the fruit of it.

00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:06.550
Talking ill about others, saying things just
to spoil the relationship is sin, in Sahaja

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.550
Yoga.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:13.459
Always talk good things about others.

00:12:13.459 --> 00:12:18.580
For example, if somebody comes and tells Me
that such and such person is not good and

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.480
all that, I tell them lies.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.760
I tell them, “That person was praising you
so much.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:31.050
Why are you saying all these things against
that person?”

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:47.309
So it is important for Sahaja Yogis to create
a more synthesis, more coordination, more

00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:55.309
combinations and more bringing in more and
more people.

00:12:55.309 --> 00:13:01.920
But people get more attached to the negative
people than to the positive people.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:12.120
That means still you are not in Sahaja Yoga
fully.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:20.800
Once you start understanding this it would
be very, very clear-cut what you should do

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.870
and what you should not do as far as these
relationships are concerned.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:33.050
I mean, in India it’s a common thing for
a minister to appoint his nephew, his son,

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.019
his wife, his grandson, even his servant into
some post.

00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:41.670
It’s a common thing, whether they are capable
or not.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.579
But in Sahaja Yoga you can’t do.

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:46.130
You have to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:53.910
You can’t just get anybody because he’s
your relation and ask that, “Mother, see

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.660
now, he’s my relation.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.409
Please help this man."

00:13:59.409 --> 00:14:02.800
Why should God help people who are not Sahaja
Yogis?

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:15.690
He does not know them and He doesn’t want
to do it.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:22.520
So our concept about family life has to change.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.700
Of course the best thing you can do for your
family is to bring them to Sahaja Yoga, but

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:35.819
if you are sticking on to people because they’re
your family, it’s very dangerous.

00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:46.430
Then there is second kind of a movement with
this behaviour, that you start thinking about

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.860
your own city: “This is my city."

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.550
You could have been born anywhere.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.170
So, “My city.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:01.040
Mother, You come to my city.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040
Is important."

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.170
It’s like: my home, my relations then my
city.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.480
Then, my country: “This is my country.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.490
Mother, You must come to my country."

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.400
I understand.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.329
Your concern is good, it’s patriotic, that
you are worried about other people in your

00:15:22.329 --> 00:15:24.410
own country.

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.200
But there should not be any attachment.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:37.800
One should be detached, and detached in the
way, I would say, that just watch.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.030
Just watch yourself and others.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:52.860
See for yourself, why are you so much interested
in your own country or in your own capital?

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.860
Why?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.560
Why is it?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.659
When you ask this question you’ll be surprised,
mostly you’ll find: “Because I belong

00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:06.789
to this place, I was born in this place, that’s
why I want."

00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:08.959
Mostly; honest answer.

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:14.700
But could be that: “I want also that these
people should become Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:23.360
It’s easy for me because I am from this
place, I would like them to be Sahaja Yogis."

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.370
This is one of the basic reasons why Sahaja
Yoga does not spread, that we get involved

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:37.819
into pockets of our family and we don’t
go across them to others.

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:45.699
So all our attention, all our behavior is
completely entangled into something which

00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:50.270
is not Sahaj.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:17:00.230
So we have to go beyond and know that our
family is different.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:05.770
The whole world is our family, so we have
to move out.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:13.930
Don’t get stagnated or entangled with a
small circle of few people who are negative,

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:19.880
but go beyond them, because you’ve got the
powers, you’ve got everything.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:28.351
You can easily cross over these barriers and
see for yourself that you are feeling now

00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:38.670
mentally very happy, physically all right,
and spiritually you are there.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:45.059
In our Indian society people take to sanyasa.

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:52.179
They’ll wear kasaya -
go out- many people after certain age take

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:54.420
to sanyasa.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:02.930
Why not take the sanyasa inside just now?

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:08.820
What is the need to wait till you get old
and then absolutely haggard and then to say

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.770
that you are a sanyasi?

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:20.190
Even anyway you are a sanyasi at that time,
but when you are young you should develop

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:26.179
this detachment, a clear-cut detachment: that
is, you are attached to Sahaja Yoga and to

00:18:26.179 --> 00:18:28.559
nothing else.

00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:35.090
Nothing is more important than Sahaja Yoga
to you.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:42.659
Once we decide that, then you move in that
line and you grow in that line very mildly,

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.590
very well.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:53.419
But supposing you get short-circuited and
move somewhere else, then how can there be

00:18:53.419 --> 00:18:56.140
growth?

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:02.970
It looks extremely simple to us: we must help
our relations, we must help all other ones.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.799
To Indians it is very easy, it happens to
them very easily.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:13.470
But the Western people are not like that.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.880
They will not go about, wasting their energy
about their relations normally.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:31.590
They are worried about themselves, and they
want that they should achieve the highest

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.260
themselves.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:45.000
Now, once we take away our attention from
the family, you’ll be surprised how this

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:56.779
attention works across the family, across
this small little wall that we have built.

00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:09.710
And you are surprised how it expands, and
how it gives you all the blessings and all

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.610
the grace of Divine love.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:24.409
We always start thinking about our relations,
about how to be kind to them, how to be nice

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:25.409
to them.

00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:33.700
Or all these things, all these behaviours of
how to be nice to them, how to be good to

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:45.360
them and all that, can be extended so much,
can expand so much.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.880
As you love them, as you care for them, as
you are attached to them, if you get attached

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.779
to Sahaj then the light will spread.

00:20:57.779 --> 00:21:06.190
For example now, near Hyderabad there are
many small cities, small places, lots of them.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:12.180
You can all take up one city or one small
little village or something.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.429
Go there and talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:18.610
It will definitely work out.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:27.660
That’s how in England they have worked it
out, and in many other countries.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:35.990
So I have to tell all the Sahaja Yogis who
are here in Hyderabad and who are also in

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:43.270
other places, like Vishakhapatnam or Vijayawada
or anywhere; all of them should understand

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:51.710
that at least they can spread it in their
city, Sahaja Yoga, very fast, in case they

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.890
get detached from their family.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:22:04.409
I know of certain Sahaja Yogis, their wives
are so strong at it that they cannot overcome

00:22:04.409 --> 00:22:10.110
even their wives, leave alone other relations.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:19.220
We have had an experience of such women.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:30.740
Specially in India there is a rule that whatever
is the dharma of the husband, that the wife

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.990
has to follow.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:38.500
But still I’ve seen that even the wives
can be very powerful because they’re so

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.770
assertive, so aggressive.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:50.270
And if the husband is simple he has to suffer.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:57.910
So here I would say that one should not succumb
to anyone because he’s dominating or in

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:04.010
any way assertive, but stand back and tell
that this is the dharma we are following,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.150
and nobody has business to check us.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:17.420
We are on a fundamental right, doing it.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:29.680
Now the question is about how we deal with
each other in Sahaja Yoga, how we live with

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:36.300
each other, how we talk to each other.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.370
What is the net result?

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:51.510
Do we have a complete rapport with other Sahaja
Yogis in the same city?

00:23:51.510 --> 00:24:10.640
Do you invite them to your house as you would
invite your neighbours?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:26.790
In any matter whatsoever pertaining to you,
any matter whatsoever, the relations have

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.420
nothing to do with you.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:43.390
That’s how you will start getting detached
and not worrying about it.

00:24:43.390 --> 00:25:11.050
Now here are the many Western Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:28.620
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS IN HINDI].

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:39.210
The description I’ve given now of when people
who are left-sided actually, they have attachments

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.490
of the left side.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.950
The right side attachments are different type,
as you know very well.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:55.340
The first one is that they are individualistic,
they don’t like collectivity.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:13.330
They think it is a force on them; it is a
binding thing, so that they cannot rise.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:20.560
Right-sided people have the biggest problem
is of ego, which is all the time sitting like

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.049
a snake, coiled up.

00:26:25.049 --> 00:26:32.890
Something goes wrong, suddenly it comes up
– Ha! and you see a snake come up now.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:43.040
The snake is very springy.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:54.340
But now with Sahaja Yoga it is getting intoxicated,
I think; it doesn’t come up.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.360
So the attachments: on what points do we get
upset?

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.500
We should write it down.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.560
All right.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:07.510
For example, what do I get upset with, Myself?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:15.059
When I see a Sahaja Yogi becoming bhootish
I get upset.

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:19.270
But you just try to find out: “When do I
get upset?” and you’ll be surprised, most

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:27.290
of those things are out of Sahaja Yoga; they
have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:36.200
But you are very upset and very angry, and you
don’t want to talk about it.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.400
So this attitude of mind has to be changed.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:48.700
When you are set now in Sahaja Yoga, how can
you be upset?

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.440
That means you are not set: simple thing.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.790
You are now set in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.850
So how can you be upset?

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:10.020
A very common language there is to say: “I
hope you are not upset”.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:18.010
When you say somebody is upset, he’s upset,
I mean, may be whether you hope or don’t

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:19.010
hope!

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:25.010
But we do not also consider how do we upset
others?

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:34.950
We don’t also find out the ways and methods,
how not to upset others.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:45.410
And even the humor we have, if it is pinching
humor, if it is disturbing humour, if it is

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:58.860
denouncing humour, that can upset a person
very much.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:10.460
So what sort of language we speak, what sort
of communication we have, what sort of

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:21.590
harm we do to people: you need not be hot-tempered,
your ego may not be seen, but it’s the style,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:31.490
very sly style of the ego, just to say something
horrible.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:37.530
Second way is of criticizing others all the
time: “This is not good, that is not good,

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.419
this not good."

00:29:40.419 --> 00:29:44.840
Who has asked you to judge it?

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:53.880
So you should not judge yourself, at the same
time you should not judge others and punish

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.900
them.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:08.190
In our day to day life we have to develop
a very sweet language, extremely sweet.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:16.920
We have to work it out, actually work it out,
because even coming to Sahaja Yoga still it

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:27.190
lingers, certain things, and these habits
can be corrected very simply, very easily.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:43.860
It belongs to the tongue, not to us, so it’s
very easy to get rid of them.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.840
The obstinacy is another thing which is a
horrible thing.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:59.240
Anybody suffers from this kind of very subtle
obstinacy; obstinacy [SOUNDS LIKE “RESTS”],

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.220
these things are tied down with a rope.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:12.450
Now whatever may happen, you are tied down:
“Once I have decided, I have decided."

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:15.640
“But what is the harm in changing?”

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.890
“No, no, no, no; we don’t want any change."

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:27.820
Now in Sahaja Yoga I’m happy, nothing is
decided, nothing is fixed.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:35.919
We were to have Puja, say, yesterday; we’ll
have it today, that too in the morning.

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:47.220
It should not upset you because it’s all
done to keep your upsetting you away.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:53.100
So when is the program and when is not the
program is not important.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:32:01.200
What is important is that how you have managed
with that change.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:12.710
If you do not know how to manage the change,
then your transformation is incomplete.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:25.800
Now this English language I have learnt in
this lifetime, and I find there are some good

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:32.191
points about it, that you must say ten times,
“Thank you” even if somebody gives you

00:32:32.191 --> 00:32:35.780
water, or fifteen times, “Sorry!”

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.240
morning till evening.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:44.210
In a way it is good, but if it’s just a
lip-service, then everybody knows that you

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:50.110
have to say “Thank you”, so they said
“Thank you” so well.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:59.460
But at the same time, if you remember how
graciously he did that for you, just remember

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.460
that.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:07.610
Next time you meet that person, all this graciousness
will come out, because you get a feeling:

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:14.580
somebody does something for you, you get a
beautiful feeling of gratitude.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:25.039
And once you get that feeling, if you remember
that feeling, then you’ll go on adding up

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:26.039
to it.

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:33.130
[SHRI MATAJI SAYS, ASIDE, “I THINK YOU ALSO
SIT IN THE SUN, IS TOO MUCH HOT”].

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.309
It goes on adding.

00:33:35.309 --> 00:33:43.220
The more you add these beautiful feelings
within yourself: “How I felt when they did

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.220
it”.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:52.300
Every time you get some sort of a experience
of that kind, if you keep it within yourself,

00:33:52.300 --> 00:34:00.429
any time you open that area of your memory,
all the beauty will start pouring on you,

00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:04.210
of that feeling.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.980
So we have to learn new methods of making
ourselves happy.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:16.139
Before that we used to be happy when we hurt
others, we used to be happy when we were sarcastic

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.730
with others.

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:28.569
But now we have to develop a new method of
making ourselves happy, and once your mind

00:34:28.569 --> 00:34:32.600
goes on to that: “I have to be happy, joyous.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600
What am I doing?

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.600
Why am I doing like this?

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.859
How can I be happy?

00:34:36.859 --> 00:34:42.020
By saying a harsh thing to others or by saying
something mischievous, how can I be happy?

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.609
I cannot be."

00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:47.129
Then, “This Mr.

00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:50.710
Ego, he makes me extremely unhappy.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.460
He’s really spoilt my mood."

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.909
And you tell him to get out now, get down,
get down.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:03.109
Then it will go down.

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:10.390
At this juncture when you are so advanced
in Sahaja Yoga, I should not have told all

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:19.230
these things to you; I agree with you entirely,
that now the time is not for telling you all

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:26.970
these things regarding your behavior toward
other Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:38.400
But even a slightest movement completely changes
the atmosphere.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:48.210
So one has to be extremely careful and attentive,
has to know what you say, what you have to

00:35:48.210 --> 00:36:03.359
say, how you behave, and how you create a
feeling.

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:08.990
In the society of Sahaja Yoga we have beautiful
people, we laugh, we enjoy, we do all kinds

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:19.660
of things, and really we are in the most joyous
company all the time.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:30.450
After all it’s joy, and what we achieve
in joy is the highest.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:37.450
At the same time we have to remember that
the collective subconscious is there, and

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.240
that may just jump sometime and come back.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:48.260
Sahaja Yoga doesn’t believe in any revenge,
hatred; nothing of the kind.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:53.930
It doesn’t believe in any kind of a false
pride, or any kind of restrictions or anything.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:37:20.440
It believes in the pure sense of humanity
and also the great work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:33.780
It gives you great pleasure to be kind, to
be nice; so subside. To subside these habits

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:41.640
you have to do some apyas, you have to practise,
and introspect yourself.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:47.680
I am not saying because anybody has reported
anything that is like that, nothing, in no

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.250
way.

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:58.520
But at this juncture I am just telling you,
because now when you will be going out you’ll

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:16.569
be meeting new people, then you might have
problems, might have problems of facing people

00:38:16.569 --> 00:38:30.050
whom you would be harsh, you would be more
meticulous, you may be much more aggressive

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:38.240
than normal.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:51.209
All these things will upset, upset them. But
if you are peaceful, tolerant, forgiving,

00:38:51.209 --> 00:38:56.580
that will definitely make them feel that you
are saints.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.569
If they are difficult leave them alone, don’t
argue, by argument you cannot give them Realization.

00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:07.460
If they don’t have wisdom they don’t deserve
it, they don’t, they are not destined to

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.540
be like that.

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:16.030
But your style has to be such that they should
know that you are saints.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:21.400
In all your self-respect, in all your love
you have to talk to them.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.780
So now when you are here in this country you
have to decide how you are going to spread

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.490
Sahaja Yoga when you go back.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:37.740
Same with our Indian Sahaja Yogis: they have
to also find out ways and methods, how they

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.099
will spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:39.099 --> 00:39:40.460
May God bless you.
