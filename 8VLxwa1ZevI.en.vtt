00:00:20.012 --> 00:00:21.933
Shri Mataji: … the attachments
(microphone).

00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:24.368
Warren: The attachments, it’s all right.
Shri Mataji: It’s all right?

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:28.240
Warren: It’s good in here because it is
very silent, then we don’t need any.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.393
Shri Mataji: Good. It’s beautiful.
Warren: Is it Your first time in a church?

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:33.855
Shri Mataji: No, many-a-times.
Warren: Many-a-times.

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:37.575
Shri Mataji: But to talk about Agnya
in a church, is the first time.

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:40.744
Warren: Very good.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.457
Yesterday I told you about this chakra
which is a very fiery chakra,

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:15.026
because this chakra is occupied by a very
fiery deity

00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:17.886
called as Jagadamba, is the Mother
of the Universe.

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:26.466
She has to protect Her children who are
trying to swim across the ocean of illusion

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:37.110
and who are being always hampered
by the people who are against God,

00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:40.940
who are anti-Christ, who are anti-God,

00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:44.659
who are devils, who are called
as rakshasas.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.806
And so She has to protect them,

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:54.739
and that’s why She is such a fiery
Goddess, like a tigress.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.377
Actually, one of Her conveyances is
a tiger, another is a lion.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.566
After that, now today we want to know
about this chakra,

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:13.668
which is the Vishuddhi chakra, Vishuddhi.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.459
America, in the map of the world, is this
centre, is Vishuddhi chakra.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.500
That’s why it is important to understand
what do we stand for, Americans.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.499
Now, this centre has got 16 sub-plexuses,

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.380
and it manifests in the gross the cervical
plexus,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.460
which looks after all the ears, nose,
throat, the eyeballs,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.619
and the neck, all the problems of this
area.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:02.589
The facial construction depends on this
chakra:

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.483
whatever is the condition of this centre
you have the expression on your face.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.589
As I told you it has got 16 sub-plexuses,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.829
and all the vowels are created in this
centre.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.510
Of course, English language has got
the vowels

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.047
which are not scientifically all right.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:33.190
But the Devanagari script has got all
the vowels, are 16 in number,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.638
and that’s why they are all produced here,
in this area.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.709
This is the gross side of this centre.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.151
The subtle side of this centre is that
this is the centre of collectivity.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:04:01.473
When man raises his head, he sees
around himself his fellowmen.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.494
And he starts seeking that there must be
something very, very common between us –

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:13.785
that we are part and parcel of one
universal Being,

00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:18.886
of the great primordial Personality.

00:04:19.087 --> 00:04:24.869
The central path of Sushumna –
of ascendance –

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.350
creates this primordial Being ultimately,
is the final,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:38.392
is the complete form of this ascendance,
of the evolution, ends up here.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.230
So this is the primordial Being, if we say
this is the primordial Being,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.950
and this is the primordial Vishuddhi.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.985
Then this Vishuddhi is the one that
represents what Muslims say as the Akbar,

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:58.399
Akbar aspect of God, the Primordial
Great Being.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.549
In Sanskrit language it is called as Virat.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.989
Now, this primordial Being incarnated
on this earth –

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.871
as I told you that all this aspect
incarnates, the central aspect –

00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:17.378
on this earth as Shri Krishna.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.940
And His power was Radha. Ra means
energy, dha means the one who sustains.

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:29.190
Ra-dha: means the one who sustains
the energy is Radha.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.990
So on this centre is Shri Krishna and
Radha.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.390
On the right side is His image as a king:

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.660
when He went away from Gokul and Mathura

00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:46.990
after killing a devil called Kamsa who was
His uncle actually,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.047
He went down to Gujarat and settled down
there and ruled that country,

00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:55.158
there He was called as Vitthala. Vitthala
and Rukmini –

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:58.494
I’m telling you these names because when
you are raising the Kundalini,

00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:05.750
if the chakra stops there or the Kundalini
stops there, you have to take His name.

00:06:06.798 --> 00:06:12.681
On the left-hand side is His sister, who
was just born and was killed again,

00:06:12.882 --> 00:06:19.710
and She appeared to us as a lightning
in the sky. She is called as Vishnumaya.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.607
All these three centres are very, very
important.

00:06:25.808 --> 00:06:31.482
When you are collective, then you are
ascending through this centre:

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.670
the power is passing through this.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.910
Actually, the root of this (ego and
superego) starts from here (Vishuddhi),

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.603
the root starts from here and grows
into this (superego),

00:06:40.804 --> 00:06:43.603
and then into this (ego) crossing over.

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:45.385
The crossing over takes (place)
there (Agnya),

00:06:45.586 --> 00:06:51.890
but the root of the ego and superego
starts at this point.

00:06:53.148 --> 00:07:02.272
Shri Krishna as we know appeared
to Arjuna as a Virata,

00:07:02.473 --> 00:07:05.390
as the Great primordial Being.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:12.070
He saw Him as a very huge, big personality,

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.202
and he saw in Him all the human beings
and all the creations moving about.

00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:22.567
And he couldn’t bear it anymore, he said,
“I don’t want to see it again.”

00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:31.350
Shri Krishna told the Gita, spoke the Gita,
only to Arjuna, only to one person.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.990
He didn’t tell it to even a second person,

00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:37.950
because He was born six thousand years
back.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.909
That time the maturity of people was so low

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.709
that He did not, He did not tell about this
to anybody else but Arjuna.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:52.949
And it was heard by another person who
wrote it down,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.229
and Vyasa is the poet who wrote about it.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.829
The Gita is the Vedanta, means the end
of Vedas.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.619
Vedas have got two sides: the first side
is where the mantras are there

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.990
to excite the right side or we can say
the elements,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:19.271
and the end of it is the philosophy.
And he used that philosophy of Gita,

00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:24.764
he used that Vedanta philosophy in Gita
to explain

00:08:24.965 --> 00:08:30.830
what is knowledge, what is God, what is
Spirit,

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.046
how to achieve it and what happens.

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:43.709
Now Krishna’s basic character of His
advent was that:

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.278
so far for Rama He was the One who lived
like a human being

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:59.232
and established a special place, or say,
established a special character

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:02.933
of a benevolent king for other kings
to follow.

00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:09.700
But this one when He came, He found that
the whole place was filled with ritualism,

00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:16.576
with all kinds of dead supra-conscious
activities, and subconscious activities,

00:09:16.777 --> 00:09:23.430
and people were indulging into materialistic
things and were very unhappy –

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:32.430
so He established Himself as the incarnation
of the play, Leela.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:39.270
That the whole world is just a drama, is
just a drama, and you are a witness to it.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:46.429
Actually, what happens when you watch
a drama, you feel that you are in it –

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.325
supposing there is Napoleon or somebody
who is in the drama:

00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:54.003
you start feeling you are Napoleon, and
even when you go home,

00:09:54.204 --> 00:09:58.196
you’ll talk like Napoleon for a while, you
carry on the joke with you.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.677
But it’s a drama, it’s outside you, it is
not you.

00:10:02.878 --> 00:10:07.069
Sometimes, when there is, say, a cinema
or something we see,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.419
we identify ourselves with the scenes
so much

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.199
that we cry, weep, sometimes feeling
very excited.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.684
But when the drama is over,

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:21.450
then we’ll suddenly realise, “Oh God,
it was a drama.”

00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:27.515
In the same way, this whole life, the human
life, is a drama.

00:10:27.716 --> 00:10:31.510
And the life… whole drama, is only seen

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:34.870
when you get your realisation: you become
a witness.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.830
Now those who have got realisation

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.270
should understand that you have become
now a witness.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.110
Start seeing everything and you’ll be
amazed.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.018
You’ll feel, “Oh, I’m so much away,
I am just witnessing.”

00:10:48.219 --> 00:10:51.270
There’s a sahaja yogini who comes from,
who came from India.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.588
And she had never travelled before
anywhere,

00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:55.629
even by plane she had never travelled
before.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.270
And comes from a very traditional family,

00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:02.648
she has never been out without somebody
going with her. Such a person.

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:05.830
She got her realisation and she came
to America.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.829
She told me that “I never felt that I
was going to America,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.750
that I was going by plane anywhere,

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.430
that I should be frightened, nothing
of the kind.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.103
And they were all telling me, ‘Be careful’,

00:11:15.304 --> 00:11:17.430
I was wondering, what are they worried
about?

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.950
I was least bothered, the whole thing
looked like a drama,

00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:25.260
I got into the plane, I came here and there
was a sea of human beings,

00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:28.593
I couldn’t see my brother, and I think
I got lost!

00:11:28.794 --> 00:11:30.829
I said, “All right, if I am lost, doesn’t
matter.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.281
I am never lost because I’m with myself.”

00:11:33.482 --> 00:11:36.145
So I was going to the taxi fellow, I was
going to tell him,

00:11:36.346 --> 00:11:38.190
“Take me down to my brother’s place”,

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:43.070
then suddenly the brother got her,
got to her and found her.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.710
But otherwise she was saying, “I was
so relaxed, I was least bothered,

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.390
most surprising, I was witnessing the whole
drama

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.348
without any, without any consideration
about it,

00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:58.446
or any awareness about it, I was just
doing it automatically.”

00:11:58.647 --> 00:12:03.428
That’s what happens to you. You see
the death,and you see the life,

00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:08.442
and you see the drama. And you do not
get involved into it.

00:12:08.643 --> 00:12:15.218
When you are not involved into it, then
you are completely at ease and at peace.

00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:19.389
As I gave you the example that if you are
in the water,

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.749
then you are worried about the waves.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:28.509
But supposing you get into the boat, then
you see the waves as fun.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.870
Or if you know how to swim, also you can
see it as a fun.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.645
So when you get realised, when you get
your realisation,

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:39.470
then the whole thing becomes like a drama

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.629
and you start developing your detachment.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:49.848
So He is the Yogeshwara: He’s the one
who is fully detachment.

00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:53.610
He’s the full detachment. Though He was
a king,

00:12:53.811 --> 00:13:00.320
though He was having a very luxurious life,
He was a detached personality.

00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:07.156
Now He on this earth when He came,
He had to have His powers with Him

00:13:07.357 --> 00:13:10.565
and He didn’t know how to bring those
powers in human beings,

00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:13.798
because He knew He won’t be able to give
realisation to people

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:16.309
at that time, 6000 years back.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:22.669
So He created a method by which He got
16.000 wives.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.109
And all these wives were nothing but His
powers-carrying people

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.386
and there is a big story about it which
I think every Indian knows,

00:13:31.587 --> 00:13:35.361
and you can also find out.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.590
He had five - I mean, He became the king,
He did all this.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.869
And He had five elements as His wives.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.415
So His own queens, five of them, were
five elements,

00:13:48.616 --> 00:13:56.109
and 16.000 wives were actually His own
powers manifested as human beings.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:02.337
And He came on this earth as Krishna,
krishi: krishi means agriculture.

00:14:02.538 --> 00:14:10.064
Means actually sowing. He sowed the seed,
He sowed the seed of spirituality.

00:14:11.781 --> 00:14:16.381
He said, “Nainam chindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah.

00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:20.669
Nachainam kledayam tyapo
na shosayati maruta.”

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.230
Means this Spirit cannot be killed,
it cannot be sucked in,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:33.349
it cannot be destroyed, neither it can
be transformed. Is eternal.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.629
And to prove that, Christ came on this
earth, at this point.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:42.149
And He by His resurrection proved it,
that it cannot be killed.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:49.230
Now I will tell you about Shri Krishna’s
life as a diplomat, He was a diplomat.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.429
He was the incarnation of diplomacy.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:15:01.669
And the best diplomacy is such that you
give such conditions which are absurd.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.224
If you give absurd conditions,

00:15:04.425 --> 00:15:09.181
then a person gets toppled down over it,
and then he succumbs.

00:15:09.382 --> 00:15:14.749
Because if you approach directly someone,
then the people are very half-baked,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.509
and they start intellectualising everything
and rationalising.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.742
So better thing is put a proposition before
them which is absurd,

00:15:22.943 --> 00:15:27.095
and let them find out for themselves,
and then they come to you

00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:32.509
with surrendered mind. Now I’ll explain
to you how.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:39.959
Arjuna was His disciple, and Arjuna,
when he went to war with Kauravas,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.195
who were the satanic forces in those days,
got into a mood of despondence,

00:15:45.396 --> 00:15:49.421
and he said that “These are – in these
are my relations, these are,

00:15:49.622 --> 00:15:53.554
there’s my one of my gurus who taught
me how to use the arrow –

00:15:53.777 --> 00:15:56.949
and how am I to fight these people?”

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.117
So then He told the Gita, that time
He spoke the Gita to him.

00:16:02.318 --> 00:16:07.008
And He said that – the first thing He said

00:16:07.209 --> 00:16:11.227
that you should find your Self, you must
have Self-knowledge,

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:15.830
you should get realisation, you should
have the knowledge.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.990
Knowledge doesn’t mean the idea about
this architecture and all that,

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.269
but knowledge is the awareness of your
Spirit.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:30.030
So Arjuna being that time a mediocre,
I should say, an intellectual –

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.560
he asked Him a question, as usual
intellectuals are good at asking questions,

00:16:33.786 --> 00:16:36.033
never giving answers.

00:16:36.234 --> 00:16:41.110
So the intellectual asked Him that
“You are telling us to go to war,

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.629
and here You are telling me to find
my Spirit.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:48.750
How do these two things meet?”, because
according to many people

00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:53.523
who are talking today also, that a man
who is realised should not fight,

00:16:53.733 --> 00:16:57.493
he should sit down and bear all the brunts
of the things upon himself,

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.750
he should suffer.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.590
So he said that “How do You say that
I become the Spirit

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.950
and then I have to fight these evil forces?

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.630
Why should I fight these evil forces then?”

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:15.341
So He said that “All right, he is a person
who is a mediocre,

00:17:15.542 --> 00:17:18.670
it’s very difficult to tell him how
to do it.”

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:24.710
Actually, it is very simple. When you are
a witness, you can fight better.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.870
You have to fight the evil forces,

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.270
why are you enlightened if you cannot
fight the darkness?

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.190
You have been made a light to fight
the darkness,

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.190
and not to be happy with yourself: “Oh, I’m
the light, I’m the light, I’m the light.”

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.709
But you have to fight the darkness, and
this they would not accept,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.509
that “Why should we fight the darkness?”
So He said, “All right.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.942
What you do is to do what you want to do

00:17:50.159 --> 00:17:56.486
and put the fruit of your doing
at the Lotus Feet of the Lord.”

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.549
Now this is absurd, this is an absurd
condition.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:07.175
Like you do your karmas, but put the fruit
of that at the Lotus Feet of the Lord.

00:18:07.376 --> 00:18:10.309
It is an absurd condition, you just
can’t do it.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:15.353
Why? Because you have got Mr. Ego sitting
down there.

00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:20.989
Whenever you do something, you always
say you are doing it.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:26.762
And even if you say, “Oh, I have married
Christ and this is God’s work I’m doing”,

00:18:26.963 --> 00:18:32.899
you may say it, but in your heart of hearts
it is not so.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.270
Because you have not got that hollow
personality where there is no ego.

00:18:37.509 --> 00:18:42.368
You must get rid of this ego, otherwise you
are doing the work and you are conscious –

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:49.070
it’s a myth, actually human beings don’t do
anything whatsoever. It’s a myth.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:53.630
For example, we have built this beautiful
church. Now what have you got?

00:18:53.831 --> 00:18:56.971
Whatever was created by God, you just
changed the forms of that

00:18:57.172 --> 00:19:00.310
and put it this way. Dead from the dead.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.110
What living work have you done?

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:06.923
You cannot transform one flower into
a fruit, can you?

00:19:07.124 --> 00:19:11.589
So it’s a myth we believe in that we do
this, we do that, we do this.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.710
Actually you don’t do anything.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.829
You only change forms of the dead from
this to that.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:23.855
And this myth that you have got, that
you do, accumulates here

00:19:24.056 --> 00:19:26.629
as this bile-coloured stuff on your head.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.430
It can be quite big, here it is shown
it can be so big as that,

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:36.913
even bigger than your body, bigger than
this big dome.

00:19:37.114 --> 00:19:39.830
The one who must have made this
must have been –

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.131
may be having a bigger thing than that,
can be possible you see,

00:19:43.332 --> 00:19:46.990
and then he walked like this on the road,
you don’t know how to balance yourself

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.528
with all this big thing on your head,
all the time this ego telling you,

00:19:50.729 --> 00:19:56.827
“Oh, you are the great.” And you meet
such a person, better be careful.

00:19:57.028 --> 00:20:00.132
Keep away from people who have done
great works.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:03.461
Otherwise they will use you for something
else.

00:20:03.662 --> 00:20:07.509
So keep away from all such people.
That’s what is the best.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.469
So this Mr. Ego develops into a big thing.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:17.778
And when it develops, it just gives you
ideas that,

00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:22.349
first of all it makes you think, “Oh, you
are great, you are very great.”

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.670
And then sometimes you get punches on it,

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.539
because people don’t accept you as that
great as you think yourself to be,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.750
then with the punch it grows even bigger –

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.950
with one more punch it’s like a rubber
balloon,

00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:37.005
you see, you punch it, it goes up, again
you punch it, it… -

00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:41.430
both ways it’s horrible: it can be pumped
in or it can be punched in.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:46.469
And once it is punched in, then it can be
very, very big,

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.430
and then you don’t know what to do,
so you recoil down

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.761
into your left Vishuddhi here.

00:20:54.597 --> 00:20:56.894
Then you say, “Oh, I should not have
done it”,

00:20:57.095 --> 00:21:01.949
because you think by doing that, your
ego is hurt.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.408
You just go there to feel guilty, because
you think by doing that,

00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.450
your ego is hurt. Your image is spoilt,

00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:13.430
your so-called image of this big balloon
is spoilt so you feel hurt.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:21.710
Now this happening of giving it or to
surrendering it at the Lotus Feet of Lord

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:27.389
can only happen when your realisation
takes place.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.094
Now those people who have got realisation,
what do you do?

00:21:31.295 --> 00:21:34.509
You say, “Mother, it is going, it is
coming.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:39.789
It’s not going, it’s not working.”
You become a third person.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.070
You raise the Kundalini – say you have
a friend, you bring the friend along.

00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:45.030
Now, the friend doesn’t get realisation.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.479
You don’t say, “I have given realisation”,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.843
you don’t say, “I raised the Kundalini”,

00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:53.442
but what you do is to say that, “Mother,
it’s not yet working,

00:21:53.643 --> 00:21:57.646
it’s little hot this side, there’s a, this
finger burning, this chakra is catching.”

00:21:57.847 --> 00:22:02.190
But you say everything in the third person,
you never say “I do”.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.179
Even if your son is not realised, or if
your father is not realised,

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.372
you will tell him, “I’m sorry, you can’t
get realisation, it is not working.”

00:22:10.573 --> 00:22:14.989
It. You become the third person.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.270
And that is what it is, when it flows
you say,

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.710
“It’s flowing, it’s working, it’s there.”

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.390
This is the theory that He tried
to propound,

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.030
that the whole thing should become,
the karma should become akarma.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:32.042
Like the sun: the sun shines, but the sun
doesn’t –

00:22:32.243 --> 00:22:35.350
is not conscious that it is shining,
it’s just emitting.

00:22:35.551 --> 00:22:38.309
It’s not bothered. It’s not conscious
of it.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:44.510
It comes, it changes so many leaves into –
gives them colour, gives oxygen –

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.990
does all kinds of things and it goes back.
Least bothered.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:53.325
It is just emitting. It does not require
any kind of a self-satisfaction

00:22:53.526 --> 00:22:56.385
that “I have done it, I am doing it.”

00:22:56.586 --> 00:23:01.506
That kind of a thing should happen to you
when you just become an akarma.

00:23:01.711 --> 00:23:06.229
That is what He was saying. This is
the karma theory of Shri Krishna.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:11.038
But He said that a day will come when
you will get your realisation

00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:15.426
and then this karma will be sucked in.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:22.473
Christ is the embodiment of all that
Krishna prophesized or said,

00:23:22.674 --> 00:23:26.511
He came on this earth to prove it.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:35.269
The second thing that He talked about
is about the Bhakti Yoga,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.949
that you must – you worship by your,
this side –

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:46.214
that you must worship God, that you must
surrender yourself to God.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:51.984
Now, when we say that we pray to God,

00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:54.055
we ask for [from] Him – I mean, we ask
everything,

00:23:54.256 --> 00:23:57.950
I mean, the way we ask God all the time
really is something so horrible.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.949
Like we’ll say that “Now I want to have
a divorce,

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:06.310
get cancer for my wife, or do this for…”
I mean, all sorts of things we ask for.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.772
We say that “We are in the war, we should
win,

00:24:08.973 --> 00:24:11.870
the enemy should be lost”, and all sorts
of things we ask for [from] God.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.390
I mean, God must be fed up the way we ask
things.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.470
But whatever it is, to surrender
at the Lotus Feet of God,

00:24:20.671 --> 00:24:25.509
through your worship, Krishna has been
diplomatic again.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:32.413
He said that “If you have to do Bhakti,
worship, it should be ananya, ananya.”

00:24:32.614 --> 00:24:35.785
Now, this word is the most diplomatic, and
He used it again and again

00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:40.069
with all these scholars and all these
people have missed it.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:44.710
Ananya means when there is not the other,
when you are connected.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:49.749
You must do the surrendering when you
are connected, which is very true.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:53.309
Without connection, if you start doing
any bhakti,

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.829
whom are you doing the bhakti?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:01.072
If there is no connection – supposing I’m
sitting in London, you are here.

00:25:01.273 --> 00:25:03.933
You are writing letters after letters,
letters after letters,

00:25:04.134 --> 00:25:08.310
I never receive them, I never read them,
I’ve nothing to do with it.

00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:10.230
So what’s the use?

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.710
You must have some connection with God
Almighty:

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:18.029
then whatever bhakti you do it has
a meaning.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:20.789
So before realisation, the bhakti has
no meaning.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:25.150
Like these mad people “Hare Rama Hare
Krishna, Hare Rama Hare Krishna” –

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:32.110
by saying these things if you can achieve
anything - then it is the easiest,

00:25:32.311 --> 00:25:35.389
but the one thing that you spoil is this
centre.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.870
You spoil the worst of all, and they always
get throat cancer.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.350
The reason is, the first of all, you spoil
the centre;

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.750
you spoil the centre because you go on
saying,

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.070
“Hare Rama Hare Krishna” too many times.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.510
What is there to take God’s name like that?
It’s very, very cheap thing.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.069
If you are realised, you don’t have to take
God’s name like that.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.030
There’s a protocol of God: if you are
to take His name,

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.835
you have to take it properly, with
a protocol, even after realisation.

00:26:05.036 --> 00:26:06.593
But if you just go on saying, “Christ
Christ, Christ,

00:26:06.794 --> 00:26:09.611
Christ, Christ, Christ”, all the way –
Christ will be so angry with you.,

00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:11.938
What is it? Is He such a cheap thing?

00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:16.870
First of all you’ll spoil, the name, here,
by taking - I mean, mechanically,

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:21.910
I mean, physically you will spoil this
throat. I mean, when I also speak too much

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.750
I have to get some sort of a soothing
thing for my throat.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.116
So you can imagine a person who is not
realised, who has no idea

00:26:30.317 --> 00:26:32.590
as to what name to be taken, he takes
that name all the time,

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.069
the “mantras” so-called that are given
to you.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.792
You get spoiled this [Central Vishuddhi],

00:26:37.993 --> 00:26:41.070
plus you spoil your - this mantra
[left Vishuddhi],

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.070
because this left side,

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:49.270
because you have taken the unauthorised
name of Shri Krishna.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.846
So you are in for a throat cancer.

00:26:53.047 --> 00:26:58.589
If you want to get it, you better join this
“Hare Rama Hare Krishna” cult.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.069
And they think they are very near Krishna.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.109
How will they recognise Shri Krishna?

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.389
But this chakra is the best among others
for one reason:

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:14.167
if this chakra is spoilt, say – smoking
spoils it a little bit.

00:27:14.368 --> 00:27:17.629
In the beginning if it is too much smoking
it spoils very badly.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:25.468
Then the, from the cervical plexus,
the nerves go down on both the sides.

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:29.709
And the sensitivity in the hands is
so little,

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.749
that when you start feeling the vibrations,

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:43.789
you may feel a jet of air coming out
of your head, a great jet,

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.030
but in the hands you may not feel anything
at all.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.029
At all, there are many who just don’t feel
anything in the hands.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.869
In the beginning they just don’t feel,
because their hands are not sensitive.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:01.429
They have done greatest harm to their
cervical plexus.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.149
And that’s why this chakra is stopped.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.150
It doesn’t give you the sensitivity, though
the Kundalini has crossed through.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.389
But gradually then Kundalini spreads
on the sides

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:17.789
and gives energy to this centre, which
passes through the system,

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:22.822
and then you start feeling in the hands

00:28:23.023 --> 00:28:26.270
the all-pervading Power which is
the knowledge.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.670
Otherwise people don’t feel it, they may
feel it in the head but not in the hands.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.589
I was really shocked when I came here
nine years back,

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:40.349
that this country was nothing but
a chimney.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:46.762
That time, everyone – whether it was
a woman, or a man, or a child –

00:28:46.963 --> 00:28:50.574
everyone used to smoke, and so much
of smoking

00:28:50.775 --> 00:28:57.029
that, really, I didn’t know how this
Vishuddhi, the America, is going to live.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.790
[Now, please pay attention here, all right?
Don’t turn round your heads. Now.]

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:06.346
Now, this centre should be used in such
a manner

00:29:06.547 --> 00:29:10.762
that you keep your collectivity.

00:29:10.963 --> 00:29:15.546
A person who is an individualist, who
keeps away from collective beings,

00:29:15.747 --> 00:29:19.146
who does not give vibrations, sits at home
before my photograph,

00:29:19.347 --> 00:29:22.869
wants to take vibrations and all that -

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:29.590
such a person will not be able to progress
much in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:35.869
This has an inlet and an outlet. Unless
and until you give, there is an outlet,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:41.790
there will not be the inlet of vibrations.
With your hands you give to others.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.429
Now, the fourth thing Krishna has said
is the Raja Yoga,

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:55.269
in which you get Kundalini awakening
and you get all these chakras acting.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.630
He has given actually the action into which
they move.

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.811
Like the bandhas take place, how these
chakras go

00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:09.630
and sort of catch hold of that part
of the Kundalini and hold it up.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.789
And how these bandhas take place,
all He has described;

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:16.949
is the thing that happens when Kundalini
starts.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.629
Like one can describe that when the car
starts,

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:29.870
the car starts moving and the, all
the other small bolts and nuts,

00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:33.628
and all of them are there, they also start
then moving one after another.

00:30:33.829 --> 00:30:38.510
The whole mechanism, the works, you can
say, starts manifesting itself.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:42.550
In the same way, within us it starts
working, this is what He said.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.943
But people are using it for Kriya Yoga
which is nonsense.

00:30:48.144 --> 00:30:52.549
Like you sit down, hold your stomach.
But the Kundalini has not started:

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.750
why are you holding your stomach, and hold
your nose, then you hold these ears?

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.254
What is the use? The Kundalini has not
yet started:

00:31:00.455 --> 00:31:04.670
why are you doing all this nonsense? You
see, there is this here your Yogananda,

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.851
who has taught this nonsense to you
of Kriya Yog.

00:31:08.052 --> 00:31:13.076
I mean, horrible it is. The amount
of diseases one can get from this...

00:31:13.277 --> 00:31:17.550
I mean, unnecessarily you shave your head.
Why to shave your head?

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.180
By shaving your head are you going to go
to God?

00:31:20.381 --> 00:31:22.247
Then why has He given you hair?

00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:26.136
They shave their head – nonsense it is,
absolutely, to shave your head.

00:31:26.337 --> 00:31:29.698
The sheep is shaved every week - every
year twice:

00:31:29.899 --> 00:31:32.870
and by shaving your head, you are not
going to go to God.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.519
These all nonsensical ideas to shave your
head, to wear a funny dress,

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.318
walk seriously like this, and you’ll go
to God?

00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:42.919
One must understand that the happening
has to take place

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.553
of Kundalini awakening has to take place
itself,

00:31:45.754 --> 00:31:48.722
is a spontaneous, is a living thing.

00:31:48.923 --> 00:31:54.789
By doing all these artificial things you
are spoiling yourself completely.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.843
It automatically happens.

00:31:57.044 --> 00:31:59.550
But all this mechanism, you don’t have
to worry,

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.709
because once the Kundalini rises,
it happens.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.364
What is actually, I now feel that Krishna
never knew

00:32:06.565 --> 00:32:08.590
that human beings will be so mad.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.150
For example supposing, if your car has
not started,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:17.338
do you start moving its machinery by hand?

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.310
And believe that the car has started
moving?

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.629
It’s the most absurd thing to do to spoil
the car.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.710
And that’s what exactly you do, when
you try to do this Kriya Yoga.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.789
There is a-kriya, you don’t have to do
any action.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.069
The action takes place by itself, it is
built-in. It is within you.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:41.749
I will give you another example, supposing
there’s a seed, and you want to sprout it.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.345
Will you try to pull the primule out of it?

00:32:45.546 --> 00:32:48.733
Will it sprout? It’s that senseless,
I tell you,

00:32:48.934 --> 00:32:52.498
the way people try to do all these tricks,
standing on their head and…

00:32:52.699 --> 00:32:56.413
God has given us legs to stand, not
the head to stand.

00:32:56.614 --> 00:32:59.709
I don’t know from where this idea has
come that you stand on your head.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.679
By that Kundalini is never awakened.
It is for a certain disease,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.984
that that head standing is good, but not
for everyone.

00:33:08.185 --> 00:33:10.150
It’s for a cure of a disease, that’s all.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.270
All sorts of funny ideas, even people
drink urine!

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.350
I mean, all sorts of things they do,
nonsensical things, you know,

00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:18.550
to get to realisation.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.169
There was one lady of Neem Karoli Baba,
he’s another horrible fellow.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.829
and she came to Me, she was like this,
like this, like this.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.546
I told her, “What did you do there?
What did you do with this man?”

00:33:28.747 --> 00:33:31.390
“Oooh Mother, he blessed me specially.”
I said, “What?”

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.830
“He gave me his water.” I said, “His water?
What is his water is this?”

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.870
And this is the water she drank, for days
together, for years together,

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:44.065
and now she says, “I can’t forget him!”

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:48.049
Imagine, to bring God to that level!

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:53.962
I mean, can there be a greater blasphemy
and ridiculous way

00:33:54.163 --> 00:33:58.910
of treating God Almighty who has created
you? There’s no respect!

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.971
No respect! You don’t respect yourself;

00:34:02.172 --> 00:34:05.390
you don’t respect your chastity, you don’t
respect your private parts.

00:34:05.591 --> 00:34:08.629
How can you respect God?

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:12.629
This is what it is, and they teach you
not to respect.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:16.099
And this is what happens when you start
reading Gita –

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.251
you see, they are all blind people, blind
people can’t read Gita.

00:34:20.452 --> 00:34:23.150
Blind people cannot read Bible: they'll
never understand,

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:25.776
they will never understand the inner
meaning of it

00:34:25.977 --> 00:34:29.792
and they’ll just twist it for their own
purpose.

00:34:29.993 --> 00:34:33.352
Now the left-hand side is the one that
gives you,

00:34:33.553 --> 00:34:39.150
what you call, the guilt feeling. I don’t
know whom to blame now.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:44.269
For example, say, the churches,
the Catholic churches.

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:48.549
I mean, when did Christ say that you are
guilty?

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.723
From where did they pick up this? I
cannot say from where they picked it up.

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:55.323
Christ could never have said that you are
guilty,

00:34:55.524 --> 00:34:58.189
that you should feel guilty, that you
should suffer.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.090
I mean, from childhood if you tell
somebody that “You are guilty”,

00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:04.590
he’ll become automatically, it’s
a conditioning on the person.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:08.452
He will devise methods to find out that
what guilt he has.

00:35:08.653 --> 00:35:12.456
After all, you are a human being, and you
can make mistakes.

00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:15.126
And you are blind, God knows that!

00:35:15.327 --> 00:35:20.549
And He also knows that all your mistakes
are to be forgiven.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:25.110
They are to be forgiven, and you are
to be given realisation.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.549
He is worried about His own creation,
isn’t He?

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:32.509
Is He going to waste you only because you
have committed some mistakes here and there?

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.909
And what mistakes can you commit?
That also let’s see.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:45.406
He is the ocean of love. He is the ocean
of compassion.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.743
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:35:50.944 --> 00:35:54.629
He is ocean, and you are a drop
in the ocean.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.870
And how much a drop can carry a dirt
that He cannot cleanse?

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:03.472
Think of it. Think of it when you say
you are guilty.

00:36:03.673 --> 00:36:05.959
This is a fashion that is developed here,

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.471
and sometimes I find this guilt is nothing
but this Mr. Ego coils up into it

00:36:10.672 --> 00:36:14.421
and says, “All right, I’m guilty,
finished.”

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.910
It is not facing the fact.

00:36:20.886 --> 00:36:23.692
Supposing you have done the mistake,
what’s the use of saying,

00:36:23.893 --> 00:36:26.949
“I have done the mistake, I have done
the mistake, I have done the mistake”?

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.523
Do you correct it? Do you correct it
by that,

00:36:30.724 --> 00:36:32.839
saying that “I have done the mistake,
now I’ve done the mistake”?

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.274
It would be something, say, we got lost
in the car,

00:36:36.475 --> 00:36:40.150
and we went into another road. Now
we sit down there crying,

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.015
“Oh, we have made the mistake, better
sit down.”

00:36:42.216 --> 00:36:45.069
Here people are waiting for me, all right,
for the programme,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.442
and I am sitting down there crying,
“We have done the mistake,

00:36:47.643 --> 00:36:50.602
we have come to the wrong line, we
should not have been here.”

00:36:50.803 --> 00:36:55.509
If I have done the mistake, correct it
and come back to the right position!

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.389
Go on correcting it!

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.588
Instead of that, this is the best way
of sitting down saying,

00:36:59.789 --> 00:37:02.017
“We have done the mistake, I should
not have done this,

00:37:02.218 --> 00:37:04.642
I should not have done this.” Putting
down yourself,

00:37:04.843 --> 00:37:10.789
“I can’t do it” – to be diffident all
the time – “Oh, I just can’t do it.”

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.380
This could be very dangerous, very
dangerous.

00:37:13.581 --> 00:37:18.988
For example, supposing in an accident
you have harmed somebody.

00:37:19.189 --> 00:37:22.136
Now you sit down there, “Oh I have done
the mistake, I’ve committed the mistake.”

00:37:22.337 --> 00:37:25.270
Oh please, get hold up of that person whom
you have harmed,

00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:29.699
take him to the hospital, get him treated!

00:37:30.837 --> 00:37:34.269
This is the way we do not face by feeling
guilty.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:39.509
It’s a very good way of Mr. Ego to coil up
into the left Vishuddhi

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:45.510
and say, “Oh, you are guilty.” Who are
you to judge yourself?

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.989
Why do you judge yourself? How do you
judge yourself?

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:51.526
You have no method of judging yourself.

00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:56.549
All the time you find out ways and methods
of feeling diffident in life.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:00.030
And such diffident people, what are they
going to do?

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.230
You have to take swords in your hand
of honesty

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.070
and of dedication to God’s work.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:10.069
There they are standing with the sword
like this [shaking].

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:15.325
They can’t even handle a little stick in
their hand, what are they going to do?

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:20.270
Because they are all very guilty people,
all the time shaking.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.330
Why to feel guilty, by making yourself
so diffident

00:38:24.531 --> 00:38:29.309
and useless warrior of God’s work?

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.092
This guilt is the worst thing, and in
Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:32.293 --> 00:38:38.541
the first mantra always I ask to say,
“I am not guilty.”

00:38:39.831 --> 00:38:43.158
You don’t judge yourself like that. You
have no business to condemn yourself.

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:47.327
God has created you with such difficulties,
now understand it.

00:38:47.528 --> 00:38:49.910
You are above everything that is
[Indistinct],

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:52.430
much above these things, much above
all these flowers,

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.509
much above all the stars, all the sky
that is created.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.070
And here you are, like fools you are
feeling guilty and sitting down at home

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:04.509
and spoiling the work of God!

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:08.580
You have to get to your realisation, you
have to get to your absolute,

00:39:08.781 --> 00:39:11.510
you have to get to your own being!

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.910
And become what you are, and not to waste
all the work that He has done here.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:22.589
How He must be feeling! How much He has
done for you, to become this!

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:28.869
And here you are, on a small thing you just
slip out, and spoil the complete work.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:34.429
Is this the way to behave towards your
Father? And towards your Mother?

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:41.910
And towards Christ, their son? Is this
the way to treat?

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.109
We have to stand up with courage,
with fearlessness.

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:49.709
This gives you fear, unnecessary
botheration, and worries

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:54.841
and you start thinking about things which
do not exist, all imaginary.

00:39:55.042 --> 00:39:57.950
Left Vishuddhi is a curse of modern times.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.669
And I would request you all to come out
of it.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:07.293
Every morning you tell yourself that
“I’m not guilty!”

00:40:07.494 --> 00:40:10.789
You must say it thrice in the morning
and thrice in the evening.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:14.826
What is there to feel guilty about?

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:21.998
I wish Christ had included this
in the prayer.

00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:25.189
But you have to forgive yourself,
first of all.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.419
I mean, He could never have imagined that
humans – human beings –

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:36.762
would be so stupid as to all the time say
that “I am guilty, I can’t forgive myself.”

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.869
Human beings have escapes for everything.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:45.069
Now this is a new modern method they have
devised of running away from reality.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:51.182
Reality is to be faced, and to be enjoyed.

00:40:52.677 --> 00:40:59.229
It is called as veeraja, is the one that
has to permeate into, joy.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:07.016
You come and sit on the throne
and enjoy.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:13.459
Today my Vishuddhi is out – now see.

00:41:20.595 --> 00:41:25.621
Now, I have been able to tell you in short
about Vishuddhi chakra.

00:41:25.822 --> 00:41:31.978
Let’s go to the another chakra here which
is called as the Agnya chakra.

00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:38.669
Agnya chakra resides in the centre
of optic chiasma.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.909
Optic chiasma is the one which crosses
each other,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:52.650
and in the centre of it is the special
centre called as Agnya chakra.

00:41:52.851 --> 00:42:05.589
Is a very subtle centre, and this centre
is adorned by our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:10.972
He is the son of Mahalakshmi.

00:42:11.173 --> 00:42:15.349
Is the son of the entire Power that resides
here.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.949
Is the Mahalakshmi, the Viratangana,
the wife of Virata,

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:23.189
the power of the Primordial.

00:42:23.397 --> 00:42:27.341
He is the son created by Her and is very
well described

00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:30.294
in the Devi Purana and other books,

00:42:30.495 --> 00:42:36.188
which are not yet translated, I think,
in English, as Mahavishnu.

00:42:36.389 --> 00:42:41.137
He is called as Mahavishnu, so the Vishnu’s
greater form;

00:42:41.338 --> 00:42:46.289
but He is the son of Vishnu, He is the son
of Shri Krishna.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:53.109
Shri Krishna had described Him as
somebody who is the Adhara,

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:56.257
is the support of the whole universe.

00:42:56.458 --> 00:43:00.389
He has given him a higher position
than Himself, see.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:04.150
And He said, “This One, when He will be
coming on this earth,

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.989
He will prove all that I have said.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:12.211
He’ll prove because He will be the essence,
He will be the Omkara,

00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:18.097
He will be the all-pervading power, He’ll
walk on the water.

00:43:18.298 --> 00:43:21.710
Not only, but He’ll be resurrected, His
body will be resurrected.”

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.251
He has described Him fully there, and He
has given Him

00:43:25.452 --> 00:43:30.754
the highest position that He is the Adhar,
He is the support,

00:43:30.955 --> 00:43:36.068
because He lives there at the Mooladhara
also, at the support of the root.

00:43:36.269 --> 00:43:41.030
And He resides – actually, He is the vice-
chancellor of this university, we can say,

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:46.389
that at every point we have to have Him
to certify.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:53.189
If He is not there, you cannot, you cannot
awaken the Kundalini,

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:58.709
if you don’t believe in Him you cannot
retain your realisation.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:02.780
Yesterday, a lady asked me, “Can we not
do it without Christ?”

00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:05.831
I said, “I’m sorry.” Without Christ –

00:44:06.032 --> 00:44:12.917
because He is all-pervading, He is the
Omkara, He is the One who is the power,

00:44:13.118 --> 00:44:16.923
He is the One who is flowing in us,
He is the Spirit.

00:44:17.124 --> 00:44:20.700
Now, if you are seeking the Spirit, how
can you do it without it?

00:44:20.901 --> 00:44:23.669
It’s an absurd question.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:29.269
It is He came on this point [Agnya], and
this being a narrow path,

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:33.709
He had to pass through it to prove what
Krishna had said,

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:38.429
that it cannot be killed, He got Himself
crucified.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:44.450
It was a drama played by Him. His Mother
was the Holy Ghost,

00:44:44.651 --> 00:44:48.510
was the part that is the Mahalakshmi, but
He didn’t say a word about Her.

00:44:48.711 --> 00:44:53.222
He didn’t say, because if He had said it,

00:44:53.423 --> 00:44:56.813
people would have put their attention
to Her,

00:44:57.014 --> 00:45:01.750
and He is bestowed with eleven powers
of destruction.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.389
He is such a powerful person.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.710
You may show Him as a lanky-panky fellow
because that satisfies your sadism,

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.750
you want to see Christ like that – He was
not like that.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:15.949
He was, He is only painted by, I think,
Rubens very well,

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.109
but the best is that in the Sistine Chapel,

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:24.629
where Michelangelo has really boldly
painted Him the way He was.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.023
He was a tall – not very tall, quite tall –

00:45:28.224 --> 00:45:31.749
and a very healthy and a hefty person
with a big stomach.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.109
He is known as Lambodara, with a big
stomach.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:41.149
And He could carry such a huge, big cross
on His back.

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.253
So people when they showed Him, I mean,
then I was amazed at it,

00:45:45.454 --> 00:45:48.034
how could they show Christ in such
a miserable state,

00:45:48.235 --> 00:45:51.989
how could they do it, I mean, horrible
it is!

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.680
This is just their own expression, that’s
how they wanted Him to be,

00:45:55.881 --> 00:45:59.014
these are the people who must have
definitely crucified Christ.

00:45:59.215 --> 00:46:02.749
Because they liked to see Him so miserable
and unhappy.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:06.429
How can a person who is a realised soul
be that way?

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:13.270
He has to be a cheerful person, fiery,
dynamic! It has to be a healthy person!

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.870
A miserable person supposing before you
stands and talks like this –

00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:18.996
are you going to believe that person?

00:46:19.197 --> 00:46:22.612
But this is the way they have treated
Christ throughout – they have maligned Him,

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:27.390
and they have treated Him, they have –
He has been crucified so many times.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:32.916
I find it impossible to believe that how
these people are reborn

00:46:33.117 --> 00:46:37.989
who crucified Him again! And again and
again they are crucifying Him.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:43.469
The crucifixion is not the message
of Christ.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:49.069
That’s why I also don’t like people to wear
the cross, I can’t see the cross.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.349
It’s not! Cross, of course, is very
helpful,

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:57.466
because if the bad spirits see the cross
they run away.

00:46:57.667 --> 00:47:01.843
But it is a reminder of something which
was unbearable.

00:47:02.044 --> 00:47:05.389
Because the Mother had all the power,
She was Mahalakshmi.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.549
He had eleven powers, eleven powers
to destroy.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.829
You can imagine, He has still those powers.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:17.734
And He had to go through all that without
destruction.

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.174
He saw through it.

00:47:21.375 --> 00:47:25.430
Now, people may say, “How was He
resurrected?”

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.509
First of all, they have an objection
to Immaculate Conception.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:34.069
I mean, they have objection for everything.
He was not a human being.

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:40.110
He was the Divine Power! I conceive you
in my heart.

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:43.597
Do you know that? And I put my Kundalini

00:47:43.798 --> 00:47:50.109
and I put you on my - from my heart into it
and I take you out from here (Sahasrara).

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.390
The way you have got your second birth,

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.543
in the same way, Christ got His
immaculate birth.

00:47:56.744 --> 00:48:04.229
She put Him in the heart and into the
uterus down below and She created Him.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:09.990
It’s very easy to doubt Him and say things
against Him because He is no more.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.453
And the Jews must learn a lesson now.

00:48:12.654 --> 00:48:14.670
They denied Him once and they have
suffered.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:17.399
Now, don’t deny Him again.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:24.949
You cannot deny the person, the embodiment
of this Divine Power.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.949
Christians may be blown off, if Christians
have tortured you,

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:31.749
forget them, they are just the same as
you are - fanatics, fanatics, fanatics.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:34.818
Whether they are Christians or they are
Muslims -

00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:37.150
Khomeini is the same as any other person.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:44.030
I do not find any difference whatsoever.
Dogmatic, ignorant, fanatic.

00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:46.954
Forget these people, they do not stand
for Christ.

00:48:47.155 --> 00:48:51.270
Christ Himself has said in second chapter
of Matthews, II verse,

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:57.226
“You’ll be calling Me, ‘Christ, Christ, I
won’t recognise you.’ Who are these?”

00:48:57.427 --> 00:49:02.189
The people who say, “Christ - we are
the solicitors of Christ.

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:06.509
We are the people who are in charge
of Christ.”

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:12.412
All of these people will be charged, and
they will be thrown away in the hell

00:49:12.613 --> 00:49:15.990
the way they have managed things about
Christ.

00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:19.544
Some of them are genuine - they don’t know
that this is artificial,

00:49:19.745 --> 00:49:23.509
they are genuinely in it, but they must
get their realisation.

00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:28.269
They must ask for their real realisation

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.656
and they must know what is Christ within
themselves,

00:49:31.857 --> 00:49:35.609
they have to awaken this Christ here.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:45.390
Now, as I was telling you that Christ said
that “You are to be born again”,

00:49:45.590 --> 00:49:48.671
that “I’m to be born in your heart.”

00:49:48.872 --> 00:49:52.523
Now, the heart centre is here as well
as here

00:49:52.724 --> 00:49:56.989
because the heart is controlled by this
centre at the fontanel bone area.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.110
And that’s what He said that “You should
get your realisation”,

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.830
when He said, “You should be put
in the heart.”

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:09.429
Now, the people of various countries, even
your country, went down to India.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:13.782
And they never told that Christ was born
who was the Mahavishnu.

00:50:13.983 --> 00:50:18.400
Because He is already described in
the Puranas that He is the Adhara -

00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:21.413
He is the One who will be - once awakened
in the Kundalini,

00:50:21.614 --> 00:50:24.590
by the Kundalini – will suck your karmas.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.222
They never went and told, so the Indians
went on with their karma-theory,

00:50:28.446 --> 00:50:31.469
and these gurus have come here to teach
you karma.

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:35.350
It is amazing how you accept all these
theories of nonsense.

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:40.589
Like they’ll say that “You have to suffer,
because you have done bad karmas.”

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.159
Then they may say that “Yes, you can
give you a balance,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.637
but you go this way or that way and you
just keep into balance”.

00:50:46.838 --> 00:50:50.094
If that is so - that you have to go to one
extreme and to another extreme -

00:50:50.295 --> 00:50:53.223
then what are they doing here? Why are
they talking?

00:50:53.424 --> 00:50:56.973
They too should shut up, because they
cannot do anything.

00:50:57.174 --> 00:51:00.830
They cannot give you realisation. They
cannot save you from this situation.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:07.110
So, it’s better that you suffer. But why do
they say you should suffer?

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:12.695
Why should they say? Because they want
to enjoy your sufferings.

00:51:12.896 --> 00:51:16.309
They want you to suffer because they
enjoy it.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:20.390
So many of these disciples who came
from these horrible gurus,

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.755
who said, “You must have your karmas
and you must suffer”,

00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:30.709
told me that they saw their gurus giggling
at them and mocking at them.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:34.110
And they showed me some of the photographs
they had taken of these gurus,

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:39.129
which show complete mockery of these
stupid disciples who were suffering

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:43.869
in their body and suffering in their mind,
in the presence of these gurus.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:48.430
So they have a double enjoyment - one
the money, another is the sadism,

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.867
and third, the greatest of all, that their
purpose is to kill you all

00:51:54.068 --> 00:51:57.402
and to destroy you all, because you are
God’s men.

00:51:57.603 --> 00:52:02.121
That they achieve by their falsehood,

00:52:02.322 --> 00:52:04.710
because you are impressed by their
falsehood.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:07.829
Now, see, if there was any false guru here
this hall would be filled,

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.507
the whole thing would be filled,
on the road there would be a jam.

00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:17.949
But the real guru - I have seen not only
here - everywhere it starts very slowly.

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:20.950
Of course, in a place where people are
very simple

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.826
and who are very sensitive it’s a different
point.

00:52:24.027 --> 00:52:29.452
But the people in a city specially, they
are so insensitive to reality

00:52:29.653 --> 00:52:35.211
and so sensitive to devils that it is
surprising, they feel very much at home

00:52:35.412 --> 00:52:39.947
with the devils and very much lost with
the reality.

00:52:40.148 --> 00:52:43.509
Because you are in falsehood!

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:46.910
So you must know that you have to become
the real.

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:51.549
You have to become that which is
the Spirit, which is not so far,

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:58.669
is shining in your central nervous system,
in your awareness.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:03.456
And this is the Spirit, is the One,
is Christ.

00:53:03.657 --> 00:53:07.498
I’ve spoken before also in the churches,
but today for the first time

00:53:07.699 --> 00:53:11.925
I am speaking about Christ in a church.
And that’s why I was very happy

00:53:12.126 --> 00:53:16.478
that at least in this church I would say
something that could establish Him,

00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:20.749
and that when people will come here,
I hope they get their realisation

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:23.989
and that something works out here, they
get at least the awakening,

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:26.540
because so many saints are sitting in front
of me.

00:53:26.741 --> 00:53:29.637
Maybe that one day will come in this
church, maybe,

00:53:29.838 --> 00:53:34.847
it may work out that people will get their
realisation.

00:53:35.613 --> 00:53:40.110
Christ’s life was only for three, four
years.

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:45.149
Nobody allowed Him to live longer than
that.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:49.590
Whatever was possible was done, but
such stupid people,

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:53.149
such stupid people, you could not talk
to them.

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:57.030
And that’s how they killed Him.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:02.947
He could not speak to them anymore and
that’s how His life was finished.

00:54:03.148 --> 00:54:07.117
But in that small life of His - what
a spark it was!

00:54:07.318 --> 00:54:10.349
What a spark it was!

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:15.510
The way people have behaved towards Him
is atrocious, I must say.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:20.611
I must say the apostles themselves, because
this Matthews and this -

00:54:20.812 --> 00:54:23.390
he was such an intellectual, such
an intellectual -

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:26.229
he would not accept the idea of Immaculate
Conception.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:28.731
Very difficult man - he would argue it out.

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:32.726
He said, “If a virgin is going to give the
child then everybody is going to say

00:54:32.927 --> 00:54:35.260
that it’s a very, very blasphemous thing,

00:54:35.461 --> 00:54:40.526
it’s a very, very illegitimate thing and
it should not be spoken of.”

00:54:40.727 --> 00:54:43.109
Horrible fellow and one better than
the other.

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:47.469
And when they took up about the spreading
of Christianity,

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:51.589
they took it in such a funny way, because
they became supra-conscious before that.

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:54.628
They started speaking the languages
of so many people.

00:54:54.829 --> 00:55:00.450
That part of Bible is wrong where they
became not realised.

00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:05.270
The wind part is all right, but so many
people I’ve seen who come to my program,

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:09.445
when they come for realisation, they feel
the wind for a while

00:55:09.646 --> 00:55:13.669
and immediately they shunt off and become
supra-conscious.

00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:17.550
Now, we’ll see what is supra-conscious
entry and the subconscious entry.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:23.147
Now you see here there are two buds.

00:55:23.348 --> 00:55:25.303
These are the two petals.

00:55:25.504 --> 00:55:31.870
One controls, of course, the pituitary,
that controls the ego,

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:38.078
and the pineal, that controls the superego.

00:55:38.279 --> 00:55:42.629
But this also has a capacity to bloat this
out this way,

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.269
and bloat this out this way.

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:51.830
Supposing you become supra-conscious:
for start, you start thinking too much,

00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:55.749
about - something about the future, what
must be the galaxy,

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:59.636
we should find out about it and you must
find out about the stars

00:55:59.837 --> 00:56:02.671
and about all these things and about
future, about -

00:56:02.872 --> 00:56:09.311
say – prophecies, what else is that is,
astrology, and all these,

00:56:09.512 --> 00:56:12.590
you see, futuristic. You people are mostly
futuristic,

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:15.856
you try to plan, you try to do - and every
plan fails, of course.

00:56:16.057 --> 00:56:21.869
But this thinking of planning of too much
can push this up this side, too much.

00:56:22.070 --> 00:56:25.644
Actually, as shown here is this side,
but actually,

00:56:25.845 --> 00:56:28.583
when it is placed, it is placed like this.

00:56:28.784 --> 00:56:32.269
The ego is placed like this and
the superego is like this.

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:33.905
Here we could not show the three
dimensions.

00:56:34.106 --> 00:56:37.910
So, from the back to this side
is the superego,

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:40.589
and from here to here is the ego.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:45.229
Now, this ego bloats out this way -
into this side.

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:49.653
And when it bloats out this side it goes
into the supra-conscious area.

00:56:49.854 --> 00:56:53.333
So it comes up this side. Now,
the supra-conscious area

00:56:53.534 --> 00:56:58.444
gives you visions, hallucinations. LSD does
that, LSD does that.

00:56:58.645 --> 00:57:03.502
Then you start seeing some eye of a person,
who is a dead person,

00:57:03.703 --> 00:57:09.789
but a very ambitious person, for example
you might get the vision of Hitler.

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:17.149
You might get the vision of, say, all these
horrible kings who ruled here.

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:21.910
You might get, you see, colours. You may
see auras.

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:25.878
And one has to understand here that
these auras start coming to us,

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:32.748
because we shift, we disintegrate from
our being.

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:36.610
That’s how we start seeing something else
separated from us.

00:57:36.811 --> 00:57:40.629
To see auras is not a good sign in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:44.723
If you are seeing auras, we have to bring
you back to the same position,

00:57:44.924 --> 00:57:48.209
because you have to be in the present
and not in the future.

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.878
You get disintegrated.

00:57:50.079 --> 00:57:55.235
For example, if there’s a machine, say,
which takes the auras - auras,

00:57:55.436 --> 00:58:00.523
I was talking to someone, who has done
that work of aura-picturing.

00:58:00.724 --> 00:58:04.909
Now, before - after realisation you don’t
get any auras in a person,

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.788
cannot get any auras in a person, because
he is integrated, completely integrated.

00:58:09.989 --> 00:58:14.389
But when he is in a mess, you start
getting the auras.

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:19.046
Like if he has cancer you’ll get auras,
if he is an alcoholic you’ll get auras,

00:58:19.247 --> 00:58:24.453
the kind with crazy auras, a normal person
may have auras not so much crazy.

00:58:24.654 --> 00:58:29.499
But auras you cannot feel when the whole
thing is integrated.

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.678
You can see in a, say, light;

00:58:33.879 --> 00:58:37.270
if there is no aberration that means
it’s a good light.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:40.070
If there is aberration, then it’s a bad
light.

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:47.978
All the seven colours of a light has to be
concentrated and has to be integrated.

00:58:48.179 --> 00:58:51.429
If they are prismatic and if they are
giving you separately,

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:54.389
then it is not one integration.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:59.030
And when it is one integration, then
you cannot see seven lights.

00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:03.050
So the person is not integrated. Now,
all these auras come to us,

00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:09.190
because we are made of seven type
of cocoons within us.

00:59:09.391 --> 00:59:14.404
But the people who are on the right side
only believe in the five cocoons,

00:59:14.605 --> 00:59:18.256
they call them koshas. I don’t think
if I have time for that,

00:59:18.457 --> 00:59:25.706
but these are the koshas have been created
by - one is created by the first centre,

00:59:25.907 --> 00:59:30.754
by the second centre, by the third centre -
this is how the physical goes - thing.

00:59:30.955 --> 00:59:35.790
By the fourth one, then the fifth one.
And the sixth and the seventh

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.029
are the things that they do not create
auras outside -

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:45.985
they create inside near the heart. And
these are created near the heart,

00:59:46.186 --> 00:59:49.709
but as soon as you get your realisation,
they all become one.

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:54.749
They all merge into one and that is
the Spirit.

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:59.549
So, as if you can say when the Spirit
exists in a prismatic state,

00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:04.909
then you get the auras of seven, but
when it becomes integrated

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:10.804
that you become one, all the auras become
one.

01:00:11.005 --> 01:00:16.296
So, integration is the aim of Sahaja Yoga
and now, I think, I have told you

01:00:16.497 --> 01:00:20.709
how you can also go to the sub-conscious
area, the same way.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:23.589
The sub-conscious area is on the left-hand
side.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.710
If you move into collective sub-conscious
area, say for example,

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:29.149
you can be triggered into cancer.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:33.045
By this triggering you might get heart
attacks and things like that, diabetes.

01:00:33.246 --> 01:00:36.629
Now, many people believe sugar gives
you diabetes - is nonsense.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:39.309
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:42.509
What gives the diabetes is too much
thinking.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:44.429
Those who do not think too much never get.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:48.271
Indian farmers never get diabetes - they
don’t know what disease this is.

01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:53.397
Because you think too much, you work too
much, this centre works too much.

01:00:53.598 --> 01:01:00.589
It has to create food for the brain, it has
to replace the brain centres.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:07.189
And these brain centres are to be replaced.
For that it creates out of fat

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:12.575
the new centres, the evolved cells, like
I said here.

01:01:12.776 --> 01:01:17.549
And because of that work, if it is too
much, it neglects the other things

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:21.790
which it has to work out throughout, one
of them is the spleen, another is pancreas.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:26.362
And when it neglects the pancreas
you get diabetes.

01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:32.667
Not by sugar. Of course, sugar because
it has to convert it into fat.

01:01:32.868 --> 01:01:36.315
But if you do not have sugar then it’s
a double work.

01:01:36.516 --> 01:01:41.989
If you have sugar, it converts it into fat
and makes it useful for your brain.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:47.350
But if you think too much, then - and you
don’t take sugar - it’s a double action.

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:51.818
But if you just take sugar and do not think
also can be problem, I think,

01:01:52.019 --> 01:01:55.417
because he has to convert too much of -
into fat, you see.

01:01:55.618 --> 01:01:57.990
So, too much work is given, there is
no balance.

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:01.710
So, one has to understand that too much
sugar is not good,

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.230
but you must take sugar, because the sugar
is needed -

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:08.389
and stop your thinking. How do you
stop your thinking?

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:12.895
Only by rising above the Agnya chakra.

01:02:14.048 --> 01:02:17.310
This is a very, very important point
at Agnya

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.590
that you must know that the thinking stops.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:24.647
Now, the thinking comes to you like this -
like a wave.

01:02:24.848 --> 01:02:29.349
It rises the thought and falls off. Another
thought rises and falls off.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:32.850
In between there is a place called
as Vilamba.

01:02:33.051 --> 01:02:36.795
Now, when the thought rises it
automatically falls round;

01:02:36.996 --> 01:02:40.750
you can see the rising of the thought,
but not falling off.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:44.030
Now, this space is the place of present.

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:49.550
This rises either from the ego or superego
and goes into the past.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:55.510
The in-between space is the present.
One is the future, one is the past.

01:02:55.710 --> 01:03:01.181
Now, this place has to increase. When
it increases, then what happens

01:03:01.382 --> 01:03:07.683
is that Agnya chakra opens more, and you
become thoughtlessly aware.

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:10.310
You become thoughtlessly aware,

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:13.426
you come in the present. There’s no
thought.

01:03:13.627 --> 01:03:18.509
And thought is the barrier between
the creation and ourselves.

01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:21.522
For example, you look at this - say,
a beautiful stone

01:03:21.723 --> 01:03:25.279
that is placed there or anything.
You watch it.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.703
Now, if you want to think, “Oh, it looks
like a man,

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:31.110
it looks like a devil or it looks like
a God”, or whatever it is,

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:33.469
there’s a thought you are putting into.

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:37.389
So, what you do when you are realised,
you just watch - you watch.

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:42.750
And whatever the joy is put there
of the creator, of an artist,

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:46.389
completely is within you, because there is
no thought.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:55.629
There is no wave, there is no disturbance
in a completely silent lake.

01:03:55.830 --> 01:04:04.310
All that is around it, all that creation
comes into it, absolutely reflected,

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:09.189
and you enjoy it in thoughtless awareness -
called as Nirvichara Samadhi.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:13.349
There’s complete Nirvichara, where you
have no thought,

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:18.509
and you start enjoying that creation
completely,

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:22.589
the joy of that is there, nothing is lost.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:27.981
So the thoughtless awareness comes in when
the Kundalini crosses this Agnya chakra.

01:04:28.182 --> 01:04:33.709
It does double work. First it makes you
thoughtlessly aware.

01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:37.230
Secondly, because the Kundalini, if it has
pierced through,

01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:42.679
it pushes these, and She fills these with
the grace. The grace falls on these.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.047
When the grace comes in, you start
relaxing, these centres also relax.

01:04:46.248 --> 01:04:48.304
These centres are in a tension.

01:04:48.505 --> 01:04:51.991
But when the grace comes in, they go
back into normal.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:56.190
So, there is more sort of expansion

01:04:56.390 --> 01:05:02.408
and the thoughtless awareness starts
establishing itself at the Agnya chakra.

01:05:02.609 --> 01:05:05.150
Now, the mantra of Agnya chakra is
the Lord’s Prayer.

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:08.749
It has got two sides, Ham and Ksham.

01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:12.109
Ham means “I am” and Ksham means
“I forgive”.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.109
So, if supposing this is catching, you
have to say, “I forgive”.

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:19.949
If there is ego within us you should say,
“I forgive”.

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:25.549
If there is superego within us you should
say, “I am! I am!”

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.189
So, it is Ham and Ksham, is the Bija,
is the seed.

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:33.069
Is a seed of the prayer - Lord’s Prayer.

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:36.150
Now, there are people who are talking
the Lord’s Prayer is not all right.

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:39.024
I mean, who are you, what do you know
about it?

01:05:39.225 --> 01:05:43.071
Everybody is challenging everyone. What
do you know? What is your authority?

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:49.589
The trouble is everybody is entitled to do
what they like with religion and with God.

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:53.889
Though they do not know anything about it,
they are absolutely ignorant,

01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:59.768
but they think they have a right. Because
there is no political control over it.

01:05:59.969 --> 01:06:04.069
Even Hitler can talk about Christ, anybody
can talk about Him.

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:07.864
And about the Prayer that He taught you,
who are you to challenge it?

01:06:08.065 --> 01:06:09.891
Who are you to challenge Him?

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:13.488
I can’t understand how do you challenge
a person

01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:18.398
without knowing your own position
in relation to Him.

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:24.790
But this is a very, very common thing
that people do and is due to ego.

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:29.645
Ego makes you high-handed. And this is
the worst type of high-handedness

01:06:29.846 --> 01:06:31.950
that you challenge God, you challenge
Christ,

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:34.549
you challenge everything which you don’t
understand.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:39.429
Your mind is limited. It’s a very limited
vehicle.

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:43.710
You cannot do anything with this mind
of yours. You have to go beyond it.

01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:46.747
Somebody has to trigger you into the space,
you have to go into there.

01:06:46.948 --> 01:06:50.393
You have to become the Spirit. Only
by realising your Spirit

01:06:50.594 --> 01:06:56.670
you can get connected with God, which
before that you are not connected.

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.309
That’s why you have to become the Spirit.

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:05.234
And the Spirit is the connection, is
the link with God.

01:07:05.435 --> 01:07:08.074
There is no other way you can be linked
with God.

01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:11.861
If you want to keep yourself in delusion,
you go ahead with it.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:16.064
But this is the real thing I’m telling you,
it’s the true thing I’m telling you,

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:21.589
for which you should know you cannot pay,
you cannot purchase it,

01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:26.390
you cannot demand it, and you cannot work
it out.

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.750
The grace of God has to come, fall upon
you to do it,

01:07:30.951 --> 01:07:35.669
or a person who is enlightened can only
enlighten you.

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:40.030
Now, about Christ if I have to speak –

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:44.070
I’ve spoken once on Christ for seven days,
one after another.

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:48.789
There’s no end to it. He was such
a great incarnation

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:56.550
that I just do not know how to say that
He’s the – I’ve spoken all about Him there.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:08:00.030
As it is we have many tapes in London,
you can send for it.

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:04.870
We are now going to have a centre here.
Herman has offered his place.

01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:11.429
And we’ll be sending those tapes there,
at least 300 tapes we have got in London,

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.430
which you can listen to, and see
for yourself.

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:21.069
And all of these tapes are very good,
because they are actually mantras,

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:24.549
they work out the mantras and you also
get - listening to them -

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:28.021
opening of your centres and all that.

01:08:28.222 --> 01:08:32.918
Now the last of all, which is embarrassing,
because, you see, already he has told you

01:08:33.119 --> 01:08:38.080
that I’m supposed to have been here
at this.

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:45.669
It is the integration.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.195
The end of it is the integration of all
these seven centres.

01:08:50.396 --> 01:08:55.811
All these seven centres are placed around
this area called as the Limbic.

01:08:56.012 --> 01:08:59.570
This is the Limbic Area. Now, if you
cut it - the brain - like this,

01:08:59.771 --> 01:09:04.190
transverse section of the brain, you’ll
find it - it’s like a lotus.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:10.029
You can find it that there the marking
is like a lotus, opened out.

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:14.800
And its 1000 petals as called, are like
this.

01:09:15.001 --> 01:09:21.085
But the colouring is not all right, you
people are so fond of these pastel colours

01:09:21.286 --> 01:09:26.389
so they have used it, but we can say that
this kind of a 1000 petals is there.

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:31.629
Now it is said in the Bible that “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames.”

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:34.925
And these are, they appear, they all
appear.

01:09:35.126 --> 01:09:43.395
But these are very large ones and they
appear as living, living flames

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:48.148
in different colours, starting from one to
another and they are thousand in number.

01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:54.069
Now, the doctors argue that “They cannot
be thousand, they have to be 192.”

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:58.310
I mean, just imagine these foolish people -
to argue on that.

01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:02.193
But they do not know they are thousand
in number, and they are placed here.

01:10:02.394 --> 01:10:07.269
But in the limbic area, all the seven
centres are surrounding here.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:13.888
Like we have got now, you see, from here,
this is the Agnya chakra. Here.

01:10:14.089 --> 01:10:19.110
Behind it here at the back, just exactly
at the back, is the Mooladhara.

01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:22.682
Surrounding it is this Swadhishthana.

01:10:22.883 --> 01:10:25.742
Surrounding the Mooladhara is
the Swadhishthana.

01:10:25.943 --> 01:10:28.657
If you are catching on Swadhishthana,

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:32.001
you can feel it within yourself,
the heaviness here.

01:10:32.202 --> 01:10:36.038
If you are catching, say, you have
diabetes, give an example.

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:38.870
Diabetes people get blind after some time.

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:43.547
They lose the power of the eyes, because
this thing oppresses the optic lobe,

01:10:43.748 --> 01:10:50.100
which is controlled by the Mooladhara
chakra, we call it as Back Agnya,

01:10:50.301 --> 01:10:53.669
this portion at the back.

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:58.538
So, this is the Swadhishthana chakra
here at the back.

01:10:58.739 --> 01:11:01.989
In the centre here you find a bone -
that’s the Mooladhara -

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:06.189
and around it is the Swadhishthana chakra.

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:12.560
Then here is the Vishuddhi chakra, is
the Virata. Is the Vishuddhi chakra here.

01:11:12.761 --> 01:11:15.626
When you catch cold, you’ll find you’ll
have a problem here.

01:11:15.827 --> 01:11:19.430
But if you apply something here, you’ll
feel better.

01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:23.990
And this is the Vishuddhi chakra which is
related to your throat, this one.

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:27.110
Now, if you have problems with collectivity
also,

01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:31.829
you might find a big block here.

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:36.669
Now, at the back of it is the Nabhi here,
at the back.

01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:40.309
This Nabhi has a left and a right side
as we have shown here.

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:44.232
The left Nabhi and the right Nabhi, there
are two, left and right Nabhi -

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:48.512
I don’t know if I have told you about that,
left - right Nabhi - but, I mean, in the,

01:11:48.713 --> 01:11:51.710
you can find out from the book that there
is left and right Nabhi.

01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:53.990
So, you have got a left and a right Nabhi.

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:59.451
And also, you sometimes feel the Nabhi
in here. Some people do feel

01:11:59.652 --> 01:12:05.990
who have problems with their gurus and
things like that, you see.

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:10.614
Then you feel it. But the whole Void
is here.

01:12:10.815 --> 01:12:14.906
And this Void is called as Ekadasha Rudra.

01:12:15.107 --> 01:12:20.109
This Void. The whole of it. It goes like
a ring round it. Round.

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:23.950
And this ring is very important, because
this you get it from the Void.

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:27.926
If you go to a bad guru or someone
you get this.

01:12:28.127 --> 01:12:31.771
And this is the one that is of the Rider -
the Rider,

01:12:31.972 --> 01:12:34.849
the one who has eleven powers
of destruction,

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.206
the one who’s going to come to slash out.

01:12:37.407 --> 01:12:39.350
Then He’s not going to give you any
counsel,

01:12:39.550 --> 01:12:41.949
He is not going to redeem you,
no realisation.

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:44.483
He’ll slash out those who are not realised.

01:12:44.684 --> 01:12:47.510
And He will emancipate the ones who
are realised.

01:12:47.711 --> 01:12:50.088
That’s the last that you don’t ask just
now.

01:12:50.289 --> 01:12:54.510
Give some time more to save more people,
because He is not going to question anyone,

01:12:54.710 --> 01:12:59.429
He is not going to allow you any more time

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:05.260
and that will be the time of complete
destruction of all the satanic forces.

01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:08.247
So that is the Ekadasha here. That
collects,

01:13:08.448 --> 01:13:12.909
because all these horrible gurus are here.
These are the Ekadashas.

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:16.843
And this is one thing is to be understood

01:13:17.044 --> 01:13:19.829
that one should get rid of this very
easily.

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:24.510
Now, these two children of Rama who
were born here,

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:28.870
and they are endowed on the sun and
the moon.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:31.549
The sun and the moon both are here.

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:36.101
And the sun became - as I told you -
Buddha ultimately here,

01:13:36.302 --> 01:13:41.933
and he became the - not ultimately -
the Mahavira, they are here.

01:13:42.134 --> 01:13:46.598
But when they were on this earth, Buddha
talked about non-violence,

01:13:46.799 --> 01:13:54.233
and people thought non-violence
to chickens, to bugs.

01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:58.537
These Mahavira people, these Jains, we have
got horrible community

01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:02.910
called Jains in India. And they believe
in vegetarianism to this extent

01:14:03.111 --> 01:14:07.928
that they get a Brahmin, pay him money
and put him in a hut

01:14:08.129 --> 01:14:13.007
and bring all the bugs of the village,
put those in the hut

01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:16.710
and the bugs live on that Brahmin.
Is a fact, even today they do it.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:21.403
And then they pay some money
to the Brahmin, because the bugs are fed.

01:14:21.604 --> 01:14:25.189
Now, you just tell me this kind
of a nonsensical vegetarianism.

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:29.029
Am I going to give realisation to chickens?

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:32.750
Just think of it. Or to the bugs or
to the earthworms?

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:36.430
You are human beings, you should
eat a flesh

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:40.192
which is not of a bigger animal than
yourself, because that’s horrid.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:44.430
But you can eat the flesh of the animals
which are smaller than you.

01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:48.590
There’s no harm in eating that - and this
kind of a nonsensical vegetarianism,

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:52.531
“Don’t do any harm to the animals”, but
they don’t mind doing this.

01:14:52.732 --> 01:14:58.451
Jains are the greatest, they are, you see,
such - just like suckers.

01:14:58.652 --> 01:15:01.774
And they don’t mind killing people for
their money.

01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:08.063
They don’t mind going for - what you call -
shikars, in hunting and killing anything;

01:15:08.264 --> 01:15:15.190
but they will not eat a chicken or even
the garlic.

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:21.141
Now, garlic, as you know, is very good
for the heart. But they don’t eat garlic.

01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:24.793
It’s very good for the heart, it’s very
good for people who have got

01:15:24.994 --> 01:15:28.029
a tendency towards hardening
of the arteries,

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:32.309
when the circulation is a problem, it’s
very good to eat that, and for cold.

01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:35.545
Those people who suffer from cold, if they
regularly eat

01:15:35.746 --> 01:15:40.852
a fresh garlic thing in the night, brush
their teeth, they’ll be much better off.

01:15:41.053 --> 01:15:45.938
So, while talking about it I would say.
Now, these seven centres are here.

01:15:46.139 --> 01:15:52.507
Now, at the fontanel bone is the centre
of the heart.

01:15:52.708 --> 01:15:57.149
Now, just imagine, it is at the centre.
So, where do I exist?

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:02.207
I mean, all of them are seven centres,
so I am just like a bubble.

01:16:02.408 --> 01:16:05.509
But if I am in your heart, I’m there.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:12.242
So, the key of Sahaja Yoga that you have
to recognise me.

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:15.455
If you cannot recognise me you cannot
progress in Sahaja Yoga,

01:16:15.656 --> 01:16:19.149
I have to frankly admit it. Because
he’s already exposed me,

01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:21.587
I don’t tell this in my first lectures,

01:16:21.788 --> 01:16:24.869
but I have to say that “Please, now
recognise me.”

01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:28.030
As your Mother I would request you
to recognise me.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.819
And you don’t have to give me anything,
just take things from me.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.381
Just have it yourself. But recognise me.

01:16:34.582 --> 01:16:38.556
If you deny me then this won’t open,
this will be always covered.

01:16:38.757 --> 01:16:41.901
That’s why at the end when you say,
“Mother, give me my realisation.”

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:44.510
Because I have come on this earth to give
you realisation.

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:50.856
That’s my job. It’s one of the worst jobs
that one can have.

01:16:54.023 --> 01:16:58.291
Because it is so difficult with people:
to talk to them, to tell them about it,

01:16:58.492 --> 01:17:03.510
and they are all the time up in arms, they
are so aggressive, and they start fighting.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:07.538
It’s a Mother’s job, which is a thankless
job, absolute thankless job.

01:17:07.739 --> 01:17:11.308
I have to do it. And also only Mother can
do it. Because if you had Christ,

01:17:11.509 --> 01:17:14.350
He would have taken those eleven things
and finished off everyone.

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:18.439
If you had asked Christ – Krishna - He had
also Samhara Shakti, He would have killed.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.558
But to use the whole thing with integrated
idea and with balancing,

01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:25.670
with understanding human beings you have
to have a Mother.

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:29.230
And that’s why sometimes people try
to become very familiar

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:36.562
and start taking advantage or taking
liberties, which is a wrong thing.

01:17:36.763 --> 01:17:42.481
Whatever I am I am and I’m Love -
I can’t help it.

01:17:42.682 --> 01:17:45.714
I really can’t help it. I’m Compassion.

01:17:45.915 --> 01:17:50.039
One day I did feel very disgusted, really.
Once I did feel very disgusted with people

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.169
the way they were, and I was just saying
that “Forget it!”

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:59.550
And then suddenly, I saw my photograph
and I saw my eyes,

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:04.233
and I said, “Nirmala, you are Compassion,
you are Compassion, you can’t help it.

01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:07.150
YYou just can’t help it.” I have to work
it out.

01:18:07.351 --> 01:18:14.830
I know it means, it means sometimes too
much, too much, but I have to work it out.

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:18.630
Now, some people come out with
a question, “Why You, Mother?”

01:18:18.854 --> 01:18:23.878
I said, “Why not you, it’s a good idea!
Come along and do it!”

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:26.665
I’ll be the best - it will be the best
for me to retire,

01:18:26.866 --> 01:18:30.168
and my husband might give you a pension
for it, he’ll so happy

01:18:30.369 --> 01:18:32.606
that I’ve found out somebody who will
replace me.

01:18:32.807 --> 01:18:35.229
But I have not yet found out somebody
who will replace me,

01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:37.669
I wish you could, will be a good idea.

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:41.083
Now, the name Nirmala itself is, means
Immaculate.

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:46.731
Means, the one who is the cleansing power.
Is a name of the Goddess also.

01:18:46.932 --> 01:18:51.509
My, actually sign name is Lalita, is
the name of the Primordial Mother -

01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:56.269
that is the name of the Primordial Mother.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:19:00.889
But to be a human being with all these
centres around you working,

01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:04.368
for example for the last three days you
don’t know how much I am vibrating,

01:19:04.569 --> 01:19:08.185
you can ask Warren and other people,
I asked them to take the vibrations,

01:19:08.386 --> 01:19:10.339
and they were doing like this, where
they couldn’t touch me.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.949
They tried to put the hand on the head,
and they were just –

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:17.870
and they didn’t know how to touch me,
even it is so much vibrating.

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:22.909
So, it’s not easy to carry this, all this
load on this human body,

01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:26.052
appear like a human being, to act like
a human being,

01:19:26.253 --> 01:19:30.109
to behave like a human being, so that
there is a rapport.

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:33.781
Why an Incarnation is needed? There
has to be a rapport,

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:38.555
because the Unconscious cannot talk to you,
whatever you see in the dream

01:19:38.756 --> 01:19:42.084
comes back to you afterwards from
the subconscious area -

01:19:42.285 --> 01:19:49.990
all the ideas will be such a mess, such
a confusion and you cannot decide anything.

01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:56.709
So, it has to come on this earth as a human
being and tell you with a language.

01:19:56.910 --> 01:20:00.029
I never knew English all my life.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:03.629
So, first time I learnt English, but still
I don’t know American English.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:09.909
I hope I’ll be able to learn something more
when I travel around

01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:14.909
and it’s a thing that - it’s God’s desire
that you are to be realised.

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:19.870
It’s all written in the Bible; it’s all
written in all the books of the scriptures.

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:25.113
It is very largely written in the books
of Adi Shankaracharya,

01:20:25.314 --> 01:20:29.029
who had described me fully, in a very
full way.

01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:32.533
And it’s easy for Indians to get to me.

01:20:32.734 --> 01:20:37.411
I mean, though I have not much disciples
in the cities,

01:20:37.612 --> 01:20:41.070
but they are aware of my Advent and they
know that I am there.

01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:43.775
Most of them know about it.

01:20:43.976 --> 01:20:47.630
But they can’t understand why I have
come to America.

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:53.142
They say that “Why do you come here?
The people here won’t accept You.”

01:20:53.343 --> 01:20:58.673
But I don’t think so, because I think you
are great seekers, very great seekers,

01:20:58.874 --> 01:21:03.229
born in this country - you are a special
type, and I have to work for you.

01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:08.961
I must say the transformation that has
taken place in the western sahaja yogis

01:21:09.162 --> 01:21:11.142
has not been achieved by Indians so much.

01:21:11.343 --> 01:21:13.950
Though they have an advantage because
they are born in a country

01:21:14.151 --> 01:21:17.916
which has basics, which keeps the attention
intact.

01:21:18.117 --> 01:21:22.140
The attention is very much intact. So,
it is easy to work it out there -

01:21:22.341 --> 01:21:24.846
here it is difficult, it doesn’t appeal
to people,

01:21:25.047 --> 01:21:29.142
but still, you are all great people,
so many of you are lost,

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:33.310
but they can be all saved. But those
who are here should know

01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:37.436
that you have the greatest opportunity
in your lives today

01:21:37.637 --> 01:21:41.469
to be realised and to give realisation
to others.

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:46.790
First of all, you have to become all right.
Then you can give light to others.

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:52.538
Now, the greatest thing that is needed
for Sahaja Yoga is wisdom.

01:21:52.739 --> 01:21:57.237
And logically you will reach at
a conclusion and understand

01:21:57.438 --> 01:22:01.778
that Sahaja Yoga is the end of all
the problems of the world.

01:22:01.979 --> 01:22:06.229
Of all the problems of the world. For
example take the capitalism and communism.

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:09.558
Now, I am a capitalist, because I have
all the powers,

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:13.179
and I am the communist, because I cannot
enjoy it without giving it to you.

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.012
But it’s spontaneous, I have not to do it

01:22:16.213 --> 01:22:19.990
because I think about it, it just works.
It is like that.

01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:23.207
All the problems: political problems,
economic problems -

01:22:23.408 --> 01:22:28.270
everything can be solved. Krishna has
said, “Yoga Kshema Vahamyaham.”

01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:32.694
“When you get your Yoga, you get your
well-being.” He has promised it.

01:22:32.895 --> 01:22:35.389
He could have said it, “Kshema Yoga
Vahamyaham.”

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:39.755
He did not, he said, “Yoga Kshema
Vahamyaham.” First your yoga, first unite.

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:43.029
Unite with the Spirit, then you are
blessed by all these things.

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:47.843
This is the centre of even material wealth,
of Lakshmi, which works out.

01:22:48.044 --> 01:22:53.174
And all the sahaja yogis who have been to
me, are blessed by material wealth also,

01:22:53.375 --> 01:22:57.429
but not too much like Mister Ford - that’s
an extreme case, that’s a headache,

01:22:57.630 --> 01:23:03.430
but they get well-being from every angle,
in a balanced way and integrated way.

01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:07.789
So the last method is of integration - that
you get completely integrated.

01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:10.693
Whatever you do, your heart supports it,

01:23:10.894 --> 01:23:13.789
your mind supports it, and your body
supports it.

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:18.240
You are completely integrated in one
being - that is your Spirit.

01:23:18.441 --> 01:23:19.430
May God bless you all.

01:23:19.630 --> 01:23:23.350
So, now this is the last lecture and I’m
going to Philadelphia,

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:28.230
and you pray that Philadelphia people
get realisation more,

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:34.190
and we get more people into Sahaj Yog,
and that they become enlightened.

01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:40.030
Then I’ll be going to Houston, then to
Los Angeles and Vancouver for a day.

01:23:40.231 --> 01:23:44.230
If you have any friends or relatives there
you can write to them,

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:49.132
take the address, so that they contact
and they come down to the program.

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:52.285
May God bless you all.

01:23:59.669 --> 01:24:03.879
Normally, I don’t tell about myself, but
today he exposed me as soon as I came,

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:09.149
I had to tell, because it’s not tactful.
It’s not tactful to say anything

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:11.626
It’s better that you discover me than
I tell you,

01:24:11.827 --> 01:24:16.278
because Christ was crucified, everybody
was tortured.

01:24:16.479 --> 01:24:18.848
I do not want to hamper my work,

01:24:19.049 --> 01:24:22.644
because it makes no difference by telling
you anything before realisation.

01:24:22.845 --> 01:24:27.472
It’s better to tell you after realisation
that I am the Holy Ghost, no doubt.

01:24:27.673 --> 01:24:30.590
I am the one about which Christ has talked.

01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:37.350
I had told them, I had never said this
on - from a…

01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:42.695
[Yogini: “Platform”] platform, and I told,
they have been telling me,

01:24:42.896 --> 01:24:45.989
“Mother, You must say that once.”
I said, “In America I’ll declare it.”

01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:50.889
So, today I declare that I am the Holy
Ghost, I am the Holy Spirit,

01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:55.068
who has incarnated on this earth
for your realisation.

01:24:55.269 --> 01:24:58.053
May God bless you.

01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:05.580
Now, any questions?

01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:08.940
Man: Mother, I’d just like to say,
“I love You!”

01:25:09.141 --> 01:25:15.395
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Man: And I
would like to sometime tonight

01:25:15.596 --> 01:25:19.026
take the rest of the pictures because I’m
not sure the others still have.

01:25:19.227 --> 01:25:24.630
And this is my important question: how
can I still my thoughts?

01:25:24.831 --> 01:25:28.211
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Man: How can I still my thoughts?

01:25:28.412 --> 01:25:31.631
Warren: He wants to know how can he
still his thoughts. Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:25:31.845 --> 01:25:35.522
Warren: How can he still his thoughts.
Shri Mataji: How can he? What?

01:25:35.723 --> 01:25:39.349
Warren: Make himself thoughtless.

01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:41.711
Shri Mataji: You just say Lord’s Prayer.

01:25:41.912 --> 01:25:45.589
Now, before my photograph. All right?
It will work out.

01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:51.287
Lord’s Prayer is the entry, it’s
the entry, no doubt.

01:25:51.488 --> 01:25:56.989
Warren: There’s a little announcement
concerning all of you –

01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:02.776
there is a photograph of Mataji which
is available from Tracy,

01:26:02.977 --> 01:26:06.178
who is sitting over there, which you
can buy,

01:26:06.379 --> 01:26:11.704
it’s a very good quality black and white
photograph, and she has a few tonight.

01:26:11.905 --> 01:26:14.456
Christine will have a stock of those
photographs.

01:26:14.657 --> 01:26:19.002
There is also a book called “The Advent”,
which a few people already received,

01:26:19.202 --> 01:26:22.990
about Mataji’s advent and about Sahaja
Yoga,

01:26:23.191 --> 01:26:29.675
which you’ll be able to buy once you settle
into Sahaja Yoga.

01:26:31.037 --> 01:26:37.735
Don’t forget that Christine is here,
Herman is here...
