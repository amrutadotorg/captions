Talk to Yogis in Rahuri

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.952
(India) 7 January 1983.

00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:03.783
You have come here to learn

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:07.936
something, to go deep into your experiences

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:14.785
of the knowledge of your roots.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.994
Shri Krishna has said that this is

00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:23.737
a tree which is upside down, the

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:27.725
roots are upwards and the

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:30.684
leaves are outwards.

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:33.434
In the same way, you

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:36.893
know that Kundalini really, when

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:40.619
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:43.884
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:49.277
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:53.271
understand that when we are now getting

00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:56.325
subtler and subtler and trying to

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:58.887
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:04.092
get out of materialistic attitude and

00:01:04.092 --> 00:01:07.157
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:11.346
sticking point. I had met one

00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:13.815
guru before, because you know I went

00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:16.619
to all of them. And I asked one of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.553
them, I said, why do you take money,

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:22.562
so much money from these people who

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:25.618
are western people? So much, why do you

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.780
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.815
because you charge them so much and

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:36.608
so heavily??And he told me that unless

00:01:36.608 --> 00:01:38.836
and until you make them beggars

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:41.365
they will never take to God. They are

00:01:41.365 --> 00:01:44.456
too rich to be near God. I mean,

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:48.015
this explanation I just could not

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:51.275
understand, it was absurd, I could not

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:57.017
understand how can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:00.009
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.326
I said, in India we have
many beggars, do you think

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:06.206
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:08.456
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:10.839
stuck up with their money and you

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.176
must just make them absolutely without

00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:17.448
any money, moneyless people.

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:25.241
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.871
What can you convince?

00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:32.467
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money?

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:37.532
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:44.124
You see, anything one can say like that if you
start like that you cannot just stop it.

00:02:44.124 --> 00:02:50.066
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:55.598
and if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

00:02:55.598 --> 00:02:59.437
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

00:02:59.437 --> 00:03:01.648
body or anything, I dont mean that.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.498
But what Iam saying, your attention.

00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:09.491
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

00:03:09.517 --> 00:03:13.447
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

00:03:13.447 --> 00:03:15.899
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.033
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:22.300
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:43.114
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:04:21.230
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

00:04:21.256 --> 00:05:37.737
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:43.658
So now, when we are
dealing with our

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:49.071
roots we have to be in the center,

00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:53.985
in the core. In the core mean we are

00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:58.987
taking in, sucking in the feeling

00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:01.237
or you can say the?

00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:08.792
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:13.057
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:18.318
Is there Gavin?

00:06:18.318 --> 00:06:21.640
[answer: Experience]

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.157
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.910
experience into your awareness and feeling.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.638
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:36.339
In Marathi it is a very simple word Jaaniiv

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.616
comes from the word ja.

00:06:38.616 --> 00:06:44.076
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

00:06:44.076 --> 00:06:46.729
Also ja has two meaning.

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:55.395
Ja means also dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous zaaniiv.

00:06:55.395 --> 00:07:05.759
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.659
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.948
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

00:07:14.948 --> 00:07:19.523
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

00:07:19.523 --> 00:07:23.149
That iswhat we have to achieve.

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:27.938
So it is  not only materialism, also emotionalism,all kinds of isms.?

00:07:27.938 --> 00:07:31.280
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.403
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

00:07:38.403 --> 00:07:44.155
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

00:07:44.155 --> 00:07:50.833
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

00:07:50.833 --> 00:08:00.125
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:13.534
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:18.169
stepping in into the dissolution.

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:21.231
Very quick!

00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:25.126
And once you very quickly

00:08:25.126 --> 00:08:28.076
dissolve into it, the whole movement

00:08:28.076 --> 00:08:29.918
of your body is quick but not jerky,

00:08:29.918 --> 00:08:37.768
is smooth and quick, rhythmic, is musical,

00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:40.934
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

00:08:40.934 --> 00:08:44.010
but is musical, is as a rhythm about

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.973
it, is very gracious.

00:08:47.973 --> 00:08:52.563
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

00:08:52.563 --> 00:08:57.808
to you very easily if you dont allow

00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:05.135
your attention to be attacked by all these isms.?

00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:06.664
There is no end to it,

00:09:06.664 --> 00:09:10.914
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:16.999
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:21.306
Then the worst of all is now
I think Sahaja Yoga-ism

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:28.553
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

00:09:28.553 --> 00:09:33.736
it will happen Sahaja, sit down.
Mother will do everything for you.

00:09:33.736 --> 00:09:36.955
The another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:40.725
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there,

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:48.879
in which people sahajayogi's get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahajayogi's

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:54.807
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may.

00:09:54.807 --> 00:10:00.555
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

00:10:00.555 --> 00:10:06.996
But see the expression of the Indian,

00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:09.480
the enamored expression, see, it

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.450
so genuine, they can't control the singing.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:20.809
Now, see, it's like a ?I just dont know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:24.235
It's so nonsensical I tell you, that either

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:26.395
they could be taken out all their money

00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:31.752
or if they are to be told now for Puja,
all of them are paying twenty-one

00:10:31.752 --> 00:10:37.288
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one

00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:41.102
and if you tell them for Puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

00:10:41.102 --> 00:10:49.304
But I have told some of you have even refused
that I mean it's so shameful I tell you!

00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:53.976
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

00:10:53.976 --> 00:10:56.137
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

00:10:56.137 --> 00:11:03.783
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical,

00:11:03.783 --> 00:11:12.719
is a feeling , is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:16.323
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

00:11:16.323 --> 00:11:24.420
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:33.192
we have seen the cases like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:39.046
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people,

00:11:39.046 --> 00:11:44.694
they build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

00:11:44.694 --> 00:11:48.683
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

00:11:48.683 --> 00:11:53.018
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

00:11:53.018 --> 00:11:57.373
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

00:11:57.373 --> 00:11:59.862
We have that kind.

00:11:59.862 --> 00:12:06.771
At the same time I have seen in the
West also such materialistic people,

00:12:06.771 --> 00:12:13.741
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

00:12:13.767 --> 00:12:20.348
see that, should abhor that,
abhor, it's shameful!

00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.676
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

00:12:23.718 --> 00:12:29.264
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

00:12:29.264 --> 00:12:35.936
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

00:12:35.936 --> 00:12:41.242
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the center.

00:12:41.242 --> 00:12:44.284
Now you are in the center.

00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:52.148
In the center, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

00:12:52.148 --> 00:12:59.993
Just think how your Mother loves you, finished!
Can you? This very sweet feeling

00:12:59.993 --> 00:13:03.309
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:09.729
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:12.260
Just think how much your Mother loves

00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:20.776
that means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

00:13:20.776 --> 00:13:27.164
then there is no thought,
you cannot think.

00:13:27.164 --> 00:13:35.283
When you think that how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini and

00:13:35.283 --> 00:13:38.577
that time there is no thought.

00:13:38.577 --> 00:13:41.916
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

00:13:41.916 --> 00:13:44.656
because you have somebody in person.

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:47.968
They never had somebody in person.

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:50.429
So I can understand their problems,

00:13:50.469 --> 00:13:52.646
there was nobody in person;

00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:56.361
they had to do it in the air.

00:13:56.361 --> 00:14:02.746
But here a sure shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

00:14:02.746 --> 00:14:13.094
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

00:14:13.094 --> 00:14:19.577
It's very simple.

00:14:19.577 --> 00:14:27.731
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:31.195
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

00:14:31.195 --> 00:14:36.115
She is going to do
everything.

00:14:36.115 --> 00:14:41.691
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:47.425
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:50.224
What does She need? She needs nothing.

00:14:50.224 --> 00:14:57.107
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

00:14:57.107 --> 00:14:59.703
Which is the best flower

00:14:59.703 --> 00:15:07.875
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:12.778
and He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:22.532
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

00:15:22.532 --> 00:15:26.240
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.744
He said, I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram.?

00:15:31.744 --> 00:15:40.104
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out, otherwise why should I wear it?

00:15:40.104 --> 00:15:43.377
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:50.780
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:56.014
So it is never one sided sort
of a thing, it is a thing that

00:15:56.014 --> 00:16:00.352
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:13.080
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:22.001
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and super ego.

00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:28.090
There is no way out.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:33.956
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

00:16:33.956 --> 00:16:39.217
know their Mother's love.

00:16:39.217 --> 00:16:44.181
I know there has been an attack on that point and

00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:46.297
the mothers have been funny there.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:51.313
But doesn't matter, when you see
something just put yourself to it.

00:16:51.313 --> 00:16:56.269
To feel your roots.

00:16:56.269 --> 00:17:01.369
These are your roots, and then you see the enjoyment.

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:04.916
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:11.733
She is sucking you down.

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:14.182
That is how you meditate now.

00:17:14.225 --> 00:17:19.992
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

00:17:19.992 --> 00:17:24.084
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:36.291
And that enamored expression that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:45.221
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini,

00:17:45.221 --> 00:17:57.294
but not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

00:17:57.294 --> 00:18:00.984
It's very joy giving.

00:18:00.984 --> 00:18:03.833
Just feel the joy of that.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:12.097
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts

00:18:12.097 --> 00:18:17.825
and then, then you can give it to others.

00:18:17.825 --> 00:18:21.321
You don't have to be crazy about these things

00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:29.793
but just to feel it within yourself.

00:18:29.793 --> 00:18:35.942
All right, now I move on to Indians because

00:18:35.942 --> 00:18:40.048
they are different style of people.

00:18:40.048 --> 00:18:44.703
May God bless you!

00:18:44.703 --> 00:18:46.914
(Marathi talk)

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.880
Now, I was telling them, I must

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:44.305
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:49.880
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.799
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:59.141
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

00:31:59.141 --> 00:32:04.381
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:10.993
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:18.846
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

00:32:18.846 --> 00:32:28.230
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:33.770
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:39.043
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

00:32:39.043 --> 00:32:44.134
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

00:32:44.134 --> 00:32:47.397
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

00:32:47.397 --> 00:32:53.983
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

00:32:53.983 --> 00:32:59.687
has been in other things like in money, or in

00:32:59.687 --> 00:33:04.085
power or in love or whatever it was.

00:33:04.085 --> 00:33:09.416
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

00:33:09.416 --> 00:33:14.308
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

00:33:14.308 --> 00:33:20.635
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

00:33:20.635 --> 00:33:24.546
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

00:33:24.546 --> 00:33:30.507
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

00:33:30.507 --> 00:33:36.867
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:39.406
Now you all have become Gurus.

00:33:39.406 --> 00:33:42.476
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

00:33:42.476 --> 00:33:48.422
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

00:33:48.422 --> 00:33:53.837
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

00:33:53.837 --> 00:33:57.104
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

00:33:57.104 --> 00:34:03.168
you can really impress
people and work it out.

00:34:03.168 --> 00:34:05.388
It has to be done very fast.

00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:09.140
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:12.595
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

00:34:12.595 --> 00:34:16.451
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

00:34:16.451 --> 00:34:21.382
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

00:34:21.382 --> 00:34:29.181
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:38.059
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:41.322
And those who have been given have a chance

00:34:41.322 --> 00:34:44.334
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:49.898
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

00:34:49.898 --> 00:34:53.533
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:56.742
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

00:34:56.742 --> 00:35:02.410
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.532
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

00:35:05.532 --> 00:35:10.073
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

00:35:10.073 --> 00:35:15.237
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

00:35:15.237 --> 00:35:21.115
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

00:35:21.115 --> 00:35:23.035
They cannot reach Ganesha;

00:35:23.035 --> 00:35:26.820
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:30.790
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.761
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:41.459
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

00:35:41.459 --> 00:35:48.025
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

00:35:48.025 --> 00:35:52.419
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

00:35:52.419 --> 00:35:56.500
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:02.722
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

00:36:02.722 --> 00:36:07.179
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:11.309
Then only it's going to work out.

00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:19.951
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:23.416
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

00:36:23.416 --> 00:36:26.342
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

00:36:26.342 --> 00:36:29.960
is within every human being and after

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.924
that you have to know that this

00:36:31.924 --> 00:36:35.843
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

00:36:35.843 --> 00:36:41.278
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

00:36:41.278 --> 00:36:43.895
you can release it back.

00:36:43.895 --> 00:36:49.085
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

00:36:49.085 --> 00:36:54.860
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.107
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

00:36:58.107 --> 00:37:01.883
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

00:37:01.883 --> 00:37:04.778
Guru then you can give the peace

00:37:04.778 --> 00:37:12.038
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

00:37:12.038 --> 00:37:15.305
But first achieve it within yourself.

00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:21.893
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

00:37:21.893 --> 00:37:25.562
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

00:37:25.562 --> 00:37:27.653
sometimes to your western mind.

00:37:27.653 --> 00:37:34.817
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

00:37:34.817 --> 00:37:41.187
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

00:37:41.187 --> 00:37:50.315
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

00:37:50.315 --> 00:37:54.443
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

00:37:54.443 --> 00:37:57.222
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

00:37:57.222 --> 00:37:58.293
So may God bless you!

00:37:58.293 --> 00:38:05.200
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.122
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:14.911
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:18.289
that you can give peace to others.

00:38:18.289 --> 00:38:24.445
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

00:38:24.445 --> 00:38:26.310
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.933
Just leave them alone.

00:38:27.933 --> 00:38:32.386
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

00:38:32.386 --> 00:38:37.277
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

00:38:37.277 --> 00:38:43.190
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.234
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

00:38:47.234 --> 00:38:49.806
was all right because I have to come to the program.

00:38:49.806 --> 00:38:53.228
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

00:38:53.228 --> 00:38:58.033
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

00:38:58.033 --> 00:39:02.152
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

00:39:02.152 --> 00:39:06.489
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:07.474
There is no need.

00:39:07.474 --> 00:39:08.987
Tell them, tell Mother.

00:39:08.987 --> 00:39:10.481
Let you talk to Mother.

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:14.019
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:17.318
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

00:39:17.318 --> 00:39:20.373
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

00:39:20.373 --> 00:39:23.145
the compassion that works, that flows.

00:39:23.145 --> 00:39:27.117
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

00:39:27.117 --> 00:39:32.712
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

00:39:32.712 --> 00:39:39.381
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

00:39:39.381 --> 00:39:41.979
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:48.101
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

00:39:48.101 --> 00:39:53.019
It's not mental.

00:39:53.019 --> 00:39:58.596
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.569
All right?

00:39:59.569 --> 00:40:04.065
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

00:40:04.065 --> 00:40:08.537
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

00:40:08.537 --> 00:40:14.084
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

00:40:14.084 --> 00:40:18.549
is in the heart, it should work.

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:22.093
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

00:40:22.093 --> 00:40:25.296
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

00:40:25.296 --> 00:40:28.187
is embodied with the working capacity,

00:40:28.187 --> 00:40:31.038
embodied with the working out capacity

00:40:31.038 --> 00:40:34.074
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

00:40:34.074 --> 00:40:35.114
It should work.

00:40:35.114 --> 00:40:39.466
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

00:40:39.466 --> 00:40:44.315
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

00:40:44.315 --> 00:40:52.559
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

00:40:52.559 --> 00:40:59.590
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.855
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

00:41:02.855 --> 00:41:06.724
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

00:41:06.724 --> 00:41:11.320
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.386
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

00:41:16.386 --> 00:41:19.925
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

00:41:19.925 --> 00:41:29.442
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

00:41:29.442 --> 00:41:32.856
that you have to ascend faster.

00:41:32.856 --> 00:41:39.269
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

00:41:39.269 --> 00:41:43.997
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

00:41:43.997 --> 00:41:47.403
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

00:41:47.403 --> 00:41:51.236
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

00:41:51.236 --> 00:41:57.370
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.431
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:05.702
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

00:42:05.702 --> 00:42:08.212
You have come here for a training,

00:42:08.212 --> 00:42:16.561
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:20.792
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:24.449
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

00:42:24.449 --> 00:42:27.207
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

00:42:27.207 --> 00:42:30.660
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:34.673
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

00:42:34.673 --> 00:42:37.599
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:43.831
That's My compassion for them and for you.

00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:46.751
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

00:42:46.751 --> 00:42:49.814
They will be all right.

00:42:49.814 --> 00:42:50.970
So, may God bless you!

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:58.040
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.701
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

00:43:10.328 --> 00:43:16.955
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
