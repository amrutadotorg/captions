04:16.789 --> 04:19.855
May God bless you all.

04:19.887 --> 04:23.701
And all the blessings of Lakshmi,
all the Ashta Lakshmis upon you.

04:23.726 --> 04:26.207
May God bless you.

05:44.901 --> 05:48.505
I want to see all of them.

05:52.145 --> 05:58.054
In the night I need it,
not in the day time.

06:32.304 --> 06:41.712
Today we have come here to celebrate
a great festival of Deepavali,

06:41.737 --> 06:49.525
meaning the rows of lights,
or the festival of lights.

06:49.550 --> 06:52.652
Somebody has to translate.

07:07.560 --> 07:14.831
It was to celebrate the coronation
of Shri Rama also,

07:20.579 --> 07:27.825
that is to say symbolically to celebrate
the establishment of a kingdom

07:27.850 --> 07:33.575
which has a benevolent
administration.

07:45.629 --> 07:53.260
Today I find all of you here
as the lights sitting before Me.

07:57.069 --> 08:03.185
And with these lights I feel
the Deepawali really celebrated,

08:03.210 --> 08:08.380
I see the twingling of those eyes,
twinkling in the eye

08:08.405 --> 08:12.615
of that light which is within you.

08:23.130 --> 08:31.864
In the lamp of light we have to put
something that is soft, like ghee,

08:31.889 --> 08:39.914
that’s something very mild and soft,
is the love of our heart.

08:52.835 --> 09:01.894
And that burns to give this soothing
light of love to others.

09:09.768 --> 09:15.237
Such a person who has this light
of love, loves himself as well,

09:15.262 --> 09:19.437
and emits love for others.

09:28.661 --> 09:34.599
I’ve been hearing about the way people
used to torture themselves

09:34.624 --> 09:37.341
to become saintly.

09:44.947 --> 09:51.516
There’s no need at all for sahaja yogis
- at all - to torture themselves.

09:55.891 --> 10:03.764
But to be the light of a higher
magnitude,

10:03.789 --> 10:09.902
they have to be full of love.

10:17.733 --> 10:22.781
And this love they get it
from where?

10:25.368 --> 10:28.821
You may say it is from Me,

10:30.261 --> 10:36.256
is true, but the sap of the tree
flows all over,

10:41.623 --> 10:45.674
and all the tree must live
together.

10:47.503 --> 10:52.928
Any leaf that wants to separate itself
will die out.

10:56.445 --> 11:02.311
So is the collectivity which is going
to make you grow.

11:04.566 --> 11:10.782
Any ideas which you have of keeping
yourself out,

11:10.807 --> 11:18.882
or preserving yourself out, or having
your houses separate

11:18.907 --> 11:23.685
from the collectivity, may be
dangerous.

11:37.621 --> 11:45.127
The houses may be separate, but they must
be the houses of all the sahaja yogis.

11:50.312 --> 11:54.837
Anybody who comes to your house,
who is a sahaja yogi,

11:54.862 --> 11:59.400
is owner of that house.

12:07.715 --> 12:12.021
That sort of a feeling should be
developed,

12:16.170 --> 12:21.621
when the light you take out from
one room to another room,

12:21.653 --> 12:25.029
it does not say: “This is my room
so I give light,

12:25.054 --> 12:28.563
if I go to another room I will not
give light.”

12:38.746 --> 12:43.529
Now, light is absolutely detached.

12:46.394 --> 12:51.657
If you do not look after your light,
it will extinguish.

12:56.520 --> 13:01.884
You have to look after it till it takes
its proper stand.

13:07.965 --> 13:10.772
And once it takes a particular
stand,

13:10.797 --> 13:16.118
then you are a strong sahaja
yogi.

13:24.047 --> 13:27.852
Then they see the light
on your face.

13:29.735 --> 13:34.004
And then you manifest light
in their lives.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.710
This light, if you put finger on it,
it will burn.

13:46.416 --> 13:50.920
But the light of love never
burns.

13:52.814 --> 13:56.231
It dissolves all that is bad.

13:59.708 --> 14:05.113
It rejects, it turns away from whatever
that is wrong.

14:10.489 --> 14:13.014
It has patience

14:14.562 --> 14:19.319
and it expels the darkness.

14:26.452 --> 14:29.888
Darkness within and without.

14:33.217 --> 14:37.913
Diwali day is specially meant
to celebrate with the lights,

14:37.938 --> 14:41.869
on a day when Lakshmi
was born.

14:50.333 --> 14:56.356
Now this Lakshmi came out
of the sea,

14:59.771 --> 15:06.467
and even today there’s lot of Lakshmi
lying under the beds of the sea.

15:16.568 --> 15:23.143
But when you do not understand
the real significance of Lakshmi,

15:27.247 --> 15:30.267
then it brings darkness

15:31.801 --> 15:34.761
and Lakshmi disappears.

15:35.736 --> 15:40.133
For example, somebody gets
lots of money:

15:42.638 --> 15:48.419
immediately he will have his first-class
bar in the house.

15:53.947 --> 15:58.317
Then he’ll have his friends to come
and have drinks.

16:01.272 --> 16:04.092
He’ll drink with them

16:04.117 --> 16:08.747
and suddenly find that Lakshmi
has disappeared.

16:14.661 --> 16:20.064
So wherever there is wine,
there is darkness.

16:23.729 --> 16:31.956
And that darkness which comes to you
with the Lakshmi,

16:31.981 --> 16:36.263
makes Lakshmi just disappear.

16:42.307 --> 16:46.961
The whole of the universe, the whole
cosmos is so well-knit

16:46.993 --> 16:53.558
that if you try to do one thing wrong
this side, everything goes off.

17:02.614 --> 17:10.165
It is so well connected, like one bulb
fuses everything fuses off.

17:20.377 --> 17:25.238
In Sahaja Yoga also, it happens
like this,

17:25.263 --> 17:31.664
that a person who is enlightened,
and tries to be nasty,

17:31.689 --> 17:37.157
tries to create problems, can make
others negative.

17:52.375 --> 17:56.868
In the beginning it used to happen
very often,

17:58.944 --> 18:04.538
like one bad apple can spoil
all the good apples.

18:08.749 --> 18:15.731
But one bad apple cannot be corrected
by all the good apples.

18:21.382 --> 18:25.695
One Hitler could make many
Hitlers,

18:28.207 --> 18:33.116
but in Sahaja Yoga when you are
grown up and established,

18:33.141 --> 18:40.905
then one bad man if comes, either he has
to run away or he has to get well.

18:55.477 --> 19:01.365
A person like that himself he tie up
all his luggage and go away.

19:08.350 --> 19:16.107
But the main people, the people
who are grown up

19:16.132 --> 19:22.906
and who are matured, should keep
their maturity and assert it.

19:32.226 --> 19:35.847
It’s in the form of light, again.

19:37.715 --> 19:43.240
Now, if there are many lights
like these are,

19:43.265 --> 19:47.857
and one of them goes out, doesn’t
matter, because it’s,

19:47.882 --> 19:51.242
there are so many others
like that.

19:59.369 --> 20:03.467
But if there is one light which is
matured enough,

20:03.492 --> 20:07.704
even all of them go away,
doesn’t matter.

20:16.113 --> 20:24.346
So the people who are half sahaja
yogis, or quarter sahaja yogis

20:29.545 --> 20:35.635
have to understand that they play
no important role in Sahaja Yoga.

20:44.826 --> 20:50.478
Everybody has to become a full-fledged
sahaja yogi.

20:55.756 --> 20:59.083
Then it matters a lot

21:00.889 --> 21:05.980
if a such sahaja yogi is sick,
or is in problem,

21:06.005 --> 21:11.961
all the angels would run to help
them.

21:21.330 --> 21:24.920
So today is a special day
to celebrate

21:24.945 --> 21:31.131
the kingdom of God on earth.

21:36.447 --> 21:42.397
As we used to pray: “Thy Kingdom
come, on this earth.”

21:45.936 --> 21:50.513
And it has come today on this
mountain.

21:53.482 --> 21:59.516
And we are here to celebrate
the coming

21:59.838 --> 22:10.850
of the kingdom of God, as we have
been praying for ages!

22:20.181 --> 22:29.828
And the blessings of kingdom of God is
that you get drenched in joy.

22:34.831 --> 22:39.731
Joy which has no duality, like
happiness and unhappiness.

22:42.917 --> 22:48.443
Is an experience of absoluteness.

22:49.474 --> 22:54.272
And just that joy is sufficient,
you don’t want any food,

22:54.297 --> 22:58.550
you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind
where you are,

22:58.575 --> 23:02.401
just in joy drenched completely.

23:14.007 --> 23:17.668
There’s no place for unhappiness,

23:18.466 --> 23:21.419
we have no heart for it.

23:23.755 --> 23:27.594
Italians were known to be
melancholic people,

23:31.709 --> 23:36.930
but now I find all of them are so joyous
that nobody can believe

23:36.955 --> 23:41.112
that they could have been melancholic
once upon a time.

23:47.590 --> 23:51.666
Not only that, but they are giving
so much joy.

23:53.910 --> 23:58.886
The program should open our eyes
of all the Europeans to see

23:58.911 --> 24:02.607
how on the stage they were singing
songs to Me,

24:02.632 --> 24:08.327
and everybody in the audience
was clapping and enjoying it.

24:20.811 --> 24:24.606
Because Italians are very humble
people.

24:26.614 --> 24:30.407
And it is the humble who will be
entering into the kingdom of God,

24:30.432 --> 24:33.131
and not the arrogant.

24:37.652 --> 24:42.521
They’ll have to go to hell to get rid
of their arrogance.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.987
This is something is very great that
we are celebrating Diwali here,

24:51.012 --> 24:54.921
that in the place where people
are humble,

24:59.836 --> 25:04.273
and they have the right to be
joyous.

25:06.341 --> 25:10.283
They have the right on their
Mother,

25:13.210 --> 25:17.789
they have the right to ask for anything
that they want.

25:20.356 --> 25:23.974
This is what is surrendering.

25:25.880 --> 25:30.519
Humble person means the person
who doesn’t have ego.

25:33.235 --> 25:38.343
So to burn off ego, and to burn off
our conditioning,

25:38.368 --> 25:42.260
we had this festival called Holi.

25:51.057 --> 25:55.333
But now we have a new festival,
which is a festival

25:55.358 --> 25:58.998
of singing songs of joy,

26:05.008 --> 26:08.063
and joy alone.

26:09.414 --> 26:13.583
In this Diwali day, let us wish

26:13.608 --> 26:19.611
that so many people fall into
this ocean of joy,

26:29.197 --> 26:38.889
and the ocean of joy has to expand
its borders, shores.

26:43.382 --> 26:46.600
A sea never does that,

26:48.472 --> 26:55.423
but sahaja yogis can do it because
they have ocean of love in their hearts.

27:00.402 --> 27:06.010
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali,
in the sense

27:06.035 --> 27:10.725
that you will enlighten more lights,
every sahaja yogi

27:10.765 --> 27:17.056
should enlighten at least hundred
lights in this year.

27:30.082 --> 27:36.645
Every person you meet, you can talk
to them about Sahaja Yoga.

27:39.505 --> 27:45.060
Not about Me. Later on,
gradually.

27:49.756 --> 27:55.151
So I hope you’ll enjoy your Diwali here,
all of you,

27:55.176 --> 28:01.290
and we’ll create an ocean which
will expand, grow,

28:01.315 --> 28:07.459
and engulf more and more people
into this joyous company.

28:16.369 --> 28:20.089
Today, I don’t want to say that
I’m sorry because I came late,

28:20.122 --> 28:24.421
which won’t be good on a joyous
day like this.

28:29.795 --> 28:33.418
But waiting has so dividends
to play, pay

28:33.443 --> 28:41.435
– waiting gives you another kind
of appreciation of meeting.

28:52.334 --> 28:55.729
May God bless you all.

29:00.577 --> 29:04.600
So we should continue with music…
