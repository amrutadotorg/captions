00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.855
May God bless you all.

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:23.701
And all the blessings of Lakshmi,
all the Ashta Lakshmis upon you.

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:26.207
May God bless you.

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:48.505
I want to see all of them.

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:58.054
In the night I need it,
not in the day time.

00:06:32.304 --> 00:06:41.712
Today we have come here to celebrate
a great festival of Deepavali,

00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:49.525
meaning the rows of lights,
or the festival of lights.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.652
Somebody has to translate.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.831
It was to celebrate the coronation
of Shri Rama also,

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:27.825
that is to say symbolically to celebrate
the establishment of a kingdom

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:33.575
which has a benevolent
administration.

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:53.260
Today I find all of you here
as the lights sitting before Me.

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:03.185
And with these lights I feel
the Deepawali really celebrated,

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:08.380
I see the twingling of those eyes,
twinkling in the eye

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:12.615
of that light which is within you.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:31.864
In the lamp of light we have to put
something that is soft, like ghee,

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:39.914
that’s something very mild and soft,
is the love of our heart.

00:08:52.835 --> 00:09:01.894
And that burns to give this soothing
light of love to others.

00:09:09.768 --> 00:09:15.237
Such a person who has this light
of love, loves himself as well,

00:09:15.262 --> 00:09:19.437
and emits love for others.

00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:34.599
I’ve been hearing about the way people
used to torture themselves

00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:37.341
to become saintly.

00:09:44.947 --> 00:09:51.516
There’s no need at all for sahaja yogis
- at all - to torture themselves.

00:09:55.891 --> 00:10:03.764
But to be the light of a higher
magnitude,

00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:09.902
they have to be full of love.

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:22.781
And this love they get it
from where?

00:10:25.368 --> 00:10:28.821
You may say it is from Me,

00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:36.256
is true, but the sap of the tree
flows all over,

00:10:41.623 --> 00:10:45.674
and all the tree must live
together.

00:10:47.503 --> 00:10:52.928
Any leaf that wants to separate itself
will die out.

00:10:56.445 --> 00:11:02.311
So is the collectivity which is going
to make you grow.

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:10.782
Any ideas which you have of keeping
yourself out,

00:11:10.807 --> 00:11:18.882
or preserving yourself out, or having
your houses separate

00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:23.685
from the collectivity, may be
dangerous.

00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:45.127
The houses may be separate, but they must
be the houses of all the sahaja yogis.

00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:54.837
Anybody who comes to your house,
who is a sahaja yogi,

00:11:54.862 --> 00:11:59.400
is owner of that house.

00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:12.021
That sort of a feeling should be
developed,

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:21.621
when the light you take out from
one room to another room,

00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:25.029
it does not say: “This is my room
so I give light,

00:12:25.054 --> 00:12:28.563
if I go to another room I will not
give light.”

00:12:38.746 --> 00:12:43.529
Now, light is absolutely detached.

00:12:46.394 --> 00:12:51.657
If you do not look after your light,
it will extinguish.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.884
You have to look after it till it takes
its proper stand.

00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:10.772
And once it takes a particular
stand,

00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:16.118
then you are a strong sahaja
yogi.

00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:27.852
Then they see the light
on your face.

00:13:29.735 --> 00:13:34.004
And then you manifest light
in their lives.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.710
This light, if you put finger on it,
it will burn.

00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:50.920
But the light of love never
burns.

00:13:52.814 --> 00:13:56.231
It dissolves all that is bad.

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:05.113
It rejects, it turns away from whatever
that is wrong.

00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:13.014
It has patience

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:19.319
and it expels the darkness.

00:14:26.452 --> 00:14:29.888
Darkness within and without.

00:14:33.217 --> 00:14:37.913
Diwali day is specially meant
to celebrate with the lights,

00:14:37.938 --> 00:14:41.869
on a day when Lakshmi
was born.

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:56.356
Now this Lakshmi came out
of the sea,

00:14:59.771 --> 00:15:06.467
and even today there’s lot of Lakshmi
lying under the beds of the sea.

00:15:16.568 --> 00:15:23.143
But when you do not understand
the real significance of Lakshmi,

00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:30.267
then it brings darkness

00:15:31.801 --> 00:15:34.761
and Lakshmi disappears.

00:15:35.736 --> 00:15:40.133
For example, somebody gets
lots of money:

00:15:42.638 --> 00:15:48.419
immediately he will have his first-class
bar in the house.

00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:58.317
Then he’ll have his friends to come
and have drinks.

00:16:01.272 --> 00:16:04.092
He’ll drink with them

00:16:04.117 --> 00:16:08.747
and suddenly find that Lakshmi
has disappeared.

00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:20.064
So wherever there is wine,
there is darkness.

00:16:23.729 --> 00:16:31.956
And that darkness which comes to you
with the Lakshmi,

00:16:31.981 --> 00:16:36.263
makes Lakshmi just disappear.

00:16:42.307 --> 00:16:46.961
The whole of the universe, the whole
cosmos is so well-knit

00:16:46.993 --> 00:16:53.558
that if you try to do one thing wrong
this side, everything goes off.

00:17:02.614 --> 00:17:10.165
It is so well connected, like one bulb
fuses everything fuses off.

00:17:20.377 --> 00:17:25.238
In Sahaja Yoga also, it happens
like this,

00:17:25.263 --> 00:17:31.664
that a person who is enlightened,
and tries to be nasty,

00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:37.157
tries to create problems, can make
others negative.

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:56.868
In the beginning it used to happen
very often,

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:04.538
like one bad apple can spoil
all the good apples.

00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:15.731
But one bad apple cannot be corrected
by all the good apples.

00:18:21.382 --> 00:18:25.695
One Hitler could make many
Hitlers,

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:33.116
but in Sahaja Yoga when you are
grown up and established,

00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:40.905
then one bad man if comes, either he has
to run away or he has to get well.

00:18:55.477 --> 00:19:01.365
A person like that himself he tie up
all his luggage and go away.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:16.107
But the main people, the people
who are grown up

00:19:16.132 --> 00:19:22.906
and who are matured, should keep
their maturity and assert it.

00:19:32.226 --> 00:19:35.847
It’s in the form of light, again.

00:19:37.715 --> 00:19:43.240
Now, if there are many lights
like these are,

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:47.857
and one of them goes out, doesn’t
matter, because it’s,

00:19:47.882 --> 00:19:51.242
there are so many others
like that.

00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:03.467
But if there is one light which is
matured enough,

00:20:03.492 --> 00:20:07.704
even all of them go away,
doesn’t matter.

00:20:16.113 --> 00:20:24.346
So the people who are half sahaja
yogis, or quarter sahaja yogis

00:20:29.545 --> 00:20:35.635
have to understand that they play
no important role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:44.826 --> 00:20:50.478
Everybody has to become a full-fledged
sahaja yogi.

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:59.083
Then it matters a lot

00:21:00.889 --> 00:21:05.980
if a such sahaja yogi is sick,
or is in problem,

00:21:06.005 --> 00:21:11.961
all the angels would run to help
them.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.920
So today is a special day
to celebrate

00:21:24.945 --> 00:21:31.131
the kingdom of God on earth.

00:21:36.447 --> 00:21:42.397
As we used to pray: “Thy Kingdom
come, on this earth.”

00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:50.513
And it has come today on this
mountain.

00:21:53.482 --> 00:21:59.516
And we are here to celebrate
the coming

00:21:59.838 --> 00:22:10.850
of the kingdom of God, as we have
been praying for ages!

00:22:20.181 --> 00:22:29.828
And the blessings of kingdom of God is
that you get drenched in joy.

00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:39.731
Joy which has no duality, like
happiness and unhappiness.

00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:48.443
Is an experience of absoluteness.

00:22:49.474 --> 00:22:54.272
And just that joy is sufficient,
you don’t want any food,

00:22:54.297 --> 00:22:58.550
you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind
where you are,

00:22:58.575 --> 00:23:02.401
just in joy drenched completely.

00:23:14.007 --> 00:23:17.668
There’s no place for unhappiness,

00:23:18.466 --> 00:23:21.419
we have no heart for it.

00:23:23.755 --> 00:23:27.594
Italians were known to be
melancholic people,

00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:36.930
but now I find all of them are so joyous
that nobody can believe

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:41.112
that they could have been melancholic
once upon a time.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.666
Not only that, but they are giving
so much joy.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:58.886
The program should open our eyes
of all the Europeans to see

00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:02.607
how on the stage they were singing
songs to Me,

00:24:02.632 --> 00:24:08.327
and everybody in the audience
was clapping and enjoying it.

00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:24.606
Because Italians are very humble
people.

00:24:26.614 --> 00:24:30.407
And it is the humble who will be
entering into the kingdom of God,

00:24:30.432 --> 00:24:33.131
and not the arrogant.

00:24:37.652 --> 00:24:42.521
They’ll have to go to hell to get rid
of their arrogance.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.987
This is something is very great that
we are celebrating Diwali here,

00:24:51.012 --> 00:24:54.921
that in the place where people
are humble,

00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:04.273
and they have the right to be
joyous.

00:25:06.341 --> 00:25:10.283
They have the right on their
Mother,

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.789
they have the right to ask for anything
that they want.

00:25:20.356 --> 00:25:23.974
This is what is surrendering.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.519
Humble person means the person
who doesn’t have ego.

00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:38.343
So to burn off ego, and to burn off
our conditioning,

00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:42.260
we had this festival called Holi.

00:25:51.057 --> 00:25:55.333
But now we have a new festival,
which is a festival

00:25:55.358 --> 00:25:58.998
of singing songs of joy,

00:26:05.008 --> 00:26:08.063
and joy alone.

00:26:09.414 --> 00:26:13.583
In this Diwali day, let us wish

00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:19.611
that so many people fall into
this ocean of joy,

00:26:29.197 --> 00:26:38.889
and the ocean of joy has to expand
its borders, shores.

00:26:43.382 --> 00:26:46.600
A sea never does that,

00:26:48.472 --> 00:26:55.423
but sahaja yogis can do it because
they have ocean of love in their hearts.

00:27:00.402 --> 00:27:06.010
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali,
in the sense

00:27:06.035 --> 00:27:10.725
that you will enlighten more lights,
every sahaja yogi

00:27:10.765 --> 00:27:17.056
should enlighten at least hundred
lights in this year.

00:27:30.082 --> 00:27:36.645
Every person you meet, you can talk
to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:39.505 --> 00:27:45.060
Not about Me. Later on,
gradually.

00:27:49.756 --> 00:27:55.151
So I hope you’ll enjoy your Diwali here,
all of you,

00:27:55.176 --> 00:28:01.290
and we’ll create an ocean which
will expand, grow,

00:28:01.315 --> 00:28:07.459
and engulf more and more people
into this joyous company.

00:28:16.369 --> 00:28:20.089
Today, I don’t want to say that
I’m sorry because I came late,

00:28:20.122 --> 00:28:24.421
which won’t be good on a joyous
day like this.

00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:33.418
But waiting has so dividends
to play, pay

00:28:33.443 --> 00:28:41.435
– waiting gives you another kind
of appreciation of meeting.

00:28:52.334 --> 00:28:55.729
May God bless you all.

00:29:00.577 --> 00:29:04.600
So we should continue with music…
