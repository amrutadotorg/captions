01:40:23.029 --> 01:40:29.090
I bow to all those who have found the truth

01:40:29.741 --> 01:40:35.296
and those who are still trying to find.

01:40:38.153 --> 01:40:42.766
The greatest problem of human beings is,

01:40:43.195 --> 01:40:47.416
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:50.844
They don’t know what powers they have.

01:40:51.122 --> 01:40:54.530
They don’t know what properties they have.

01:40:54.704 --> 01:40:57.956
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

01:40:58.630 --> 01:41:03.928
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

01:41:04.619 --> 01:41:08.699
If you could just peep in your heart

01:41:08.850 --> 01:41:13.865
and start thinking about the spiritual life

01:41:14.019 --> 01:41:19.823
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:24.736
treasure of powers of love,

01:41:24.986 --> 01:41:30.886
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

01:41:31.434 --> 01:41:38.364
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

01:41:39.349 --> 01:41:42.925
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

01:41:43.076 --> 01:41:46.953
that they do not realize what powers they have,

01:41:47.072 --> 01:41:52.061
and sometimes I find they are little shy
to talk about Sahaja Yoga

01:41:52.294 --> 01:41:58.612
or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

01:41:59.641 --> 01:42:06.062
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:11.411
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

01:42:12.483 --> 01:42:14.737
Unless and until you face others

01:42:14.864 --> 01:42:18.573
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

01:42:18.843 --> 01:42:26.313
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

01:42:27.028 --> 01:42:32.446
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

01:42:33.112 --> 01:42:39.677
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:46.437
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

01:42:46.597 --> 01:42:49.282
you are cleansing yourself.

01:42:49.438 --> 01:42:56.849
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

01:42:56.983 --> 01:43:03.420
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

01:43:03.611 --> 01:43:11.592
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

01:43:12.623 --> 01:43:15.994
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

01:43:16.217 --> 01:43:22.072
that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

01:43:23.093 --> 01:43:25.888
they all drop out.

01:43:26.341 --> 01:43:29.208
But we must face ourselves.

01:43:30.031 --> 01:43:32.902
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

01:43:33.235 --> 01:43:37.193
that we can become a very great people

01:43:37.242 --> 01:43:40.958
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

01:43:41.188 --> 01:43:44.242
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

01:43:44.551 --> 01:43:47.136
It’s not the outside ambition,

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:52.794
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

01:43:53.537 --> 01:43:57.560
All of you are quite intelligent

01:43:57.735 --> 01:44:01.552
and are experts, I should say,

01:44:01.655 --> 01:44:05.280
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

01:44:05.509 --> 01:44:08.959
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

01:44:09.338 --> 01:44:12.097
Do you know about yourself

01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:16.105
what you can do, what you are capable of?

01:44:16.367 --> 01:44:19.440
That’s the point where we are missing.

01:44:19.527 --> 01:44:22.409
All right, it is the urge within

01:44:22.529 --> 01:44:25.735
because you have got your self-realization.

01:44:26.153 --> 01:44:33.128
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

01:44:33.414 --> 01:44:35.975
that you know the truth.

01:44:36.192 --> 01:44:41.419
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

01:44:41.545 --> 01:44:45.303
is to spread the truth to make

01:44:45.335 --> 01:44:51.386
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:55.193
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

01:44:55.383 --> 01:45:00.521
they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

01:45:00.521 --> 01:45:03.103
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

01:45:03.854 --> 01:45:09.431
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

01:45:09.566 --> 01:45:14.227
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

01:45:14.457 --> 01:45:17.909
by giving realizations to others,

01:45:18.068 --> 01:45:21.822
by making them understand what are

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.259
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

01:45:26.335 --> 01:45:28.008
What they can achieve.

01:45:28.218 --> 01:45:33.243
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:38.005
But this fear that we may develop ego,

01:45:38.156 --> 01:45:41.805
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

01:45:42.084 --> 01:45:44.182
You cannot.

01:45:44.406 --> 01:45:49.063
Because the more you will meditate,
the more you will face yourself,

01:45:49.274 --> 01:45:55.207
you will know that you have so many great things within you

01:45:55.351 --> 01:46:01.317
just like a storehouse of jewels.

01:46:02.153 --> 01:46:05.073
You must respect yourself

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:09.526
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

01:46:09.638 --> 01:46:12.563
Not what you want to achieve outside.

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:17.409
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

01:46:17.542 --> 01:46:22.222
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

01:46:22.411 --> 01:46:27.978
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

01:46:28.336 --> 01:46:31.510
of great value system within you

01:46:31.684 --> 01:46:34.893
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

01:46:35.023 --> 01:46:39.409
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

01:46:39.575 --> 01:46:44.339
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

01:46:45.735 --> 01:46:49.067
But as it is I find,

01:46:49.417 --> 01:46:52.513
the people are either money oriented

01:46:52.648 --> 01:46:56.576
or power oriented outside.

01:46:57.503 --> 01:46:58.612
Not inside.

01:46:58.764 --> 01:47:03.238
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

01:47:03.421 --> 01:47:07.691
inside everything that you can think of.

01:47:08.085 --> 01:47:13.006
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

01:47:13.792 --> 01:47:16.662
Now, they have become great speakers.

01:47:16.868 --> 01:47:21.318
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

01:47:21.519 --> 01:47:27.207
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

01:47:27.326 --> 01:47:30.972
and that with that knowledge you change others.

01:47:31.153 --> 01:47:34.554
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

01:47:34.702 --> 01:47:37.381
You have to spread out.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.094
This power has been given to you

01:47:40.275 --> 01:47:43.943
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

01:47:44.238 --> 01:47:46.696
and to be kind and gentle

01:47:46.903 --> 01:47:50.214
and talk to people in that way that they know

01:47:50.381 --> 01:47:53.547
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:47:55.189 --> 01:48:00.736
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

01:48:00.847 --> 01:48:03.712
but to know yourself fully,

01:48:03.814 --> 01:48:09.060
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

01:48:09.337 --> 01:48:13.898
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
millions and millions.

01:48:14.135 --> 01:48:17.086
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

01:48:17.512 --> 01:48:20.174
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

01:48:20.465 --> 01:48:24.674
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

01:48:24.817 --> 01:48:27.682
that “there must be something in me

01:48:27.933 --> 01:48:30.712
that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

01:48:30.879 --> 01:48:33.387
and to understand the subtle system."

01:48:33.586 --> 01:48:35.384
It’s a very subtle system

01:48:35.577 --> 01:48:39.178
and it can be known only to very subtle people

01:48:39.281 --> 01:48:41.549
and not to gross people.

01:48:41.838 --> 01:48:47.476
But if you yourself discover yourself

01:48:47.706 --> 01:48:51.920
and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

01:48:52.091 --> 01:48:53.974
because you are not ego.

01:48:54.512 --> 01:48:57.066
Those who have ego, as I told you,

01:48:57.203 --> 01:49:00.719
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

01:49:00.888 --> 01:49:06.891
to organize things something to promote them.

01:49:07.272 --> 01:49:09.785
They are on a very different level.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.930
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

01:49:15.033 --> 01:49:18.713
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

01:49:19.506 --> 01:49:20.920
What am I?

01:49:21.193 --> 01:49:23.425
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

01:49:23.576 --> 01:49:26.174
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

01:49:26.283 --> 01:49:29.583
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:32.644
That means you are something great.

01:49:32.747 --> 01:49:37.988
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

01:49:38.173 --> 01:49:41.866
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

01:49:41.993 --> 01:49:45.915
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

01:49:45.994 --> 01:49:48.641
But you will be an ocean of love.

01:49:49.483 --> 01:49:51.225
That’s what it has to be.

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:53.251
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

01:49:53.344 --> 01:49:56.666
I understand that these are the worst days,

01:49:56.753 --> 01:49:59.461
it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

01:49:59.507 --> 01:50:03.654
But why are you here during this time?

01:50:04.137 --> 01:50:06.553
To enlighten people.

01:50:06.764 --> 01:50:09.320
To give them the right ideas.

01:50:09.467 --> 01:50:13.370
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

01:50:13.505 --> 01:50:16.725
that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

01:50:16.951 --> 01:50:22.531
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

01:50:23.332 --> 01:50:29.301
He realized in very young age that he has to

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.939
assert on others his own value system

01:50:34.034 --> 01:50:36.894
by showing his own example.

01:50:38.174 --> 01:50:42.698
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

01:50:42.891 --> 01:50:47.209
still he has shown such results.

01:50:47.454 --> 01:50:50.325
I have read many lives of this kind.

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:53.311
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

01:50:53.436 --> 01:50:55.816
We had everywhere one person like that.

01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:58.945
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

01:50:59.089 --> 01:51:03.472
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

01:51:03.607 --> 01:51:05.838
who used to respect Me so much.

01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:08.623
People would wonder why should he respect Me

01:51:08.758 --> 01:51:11.472
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

01:51:11.724 --> 01:51:14.521
because he realized what I was.

01:51:14.704 --> 01:51:18.084
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

01:51:18.243 --> 01:51:20.141
Now, you people have a chance.

01:51:20.326 --> 01:51:23.286
All right, I am quite old now.

01:51:23.467 --> 01:51:26.879
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

01:51:27.196 --> 01:51:30.370
Till I live I’ll work very hard

01:51:30.537 --> 01:51:34.100
to convince you about your own,

01:51:34.933 --> 01:51:39.638
your own personality, your own self.

01:51:39.789 --> 01:51:42.369
That’s what I am living for.

01:51:42.539 --> 01:51:45.437
Till you are completely convinced.

01:51:45.568 --> 01:51:49.172
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

01:51:49.252 --> 01:51:53.079
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

01:51:53.409 --> 01:51:55.614
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

01:51:55.717 --> 01:51:59.182
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

01:51:59.555 --> 01:52:04.994
unless and until you find out what is your personality

01:52:05.248 --> 01:52:07.526
in the real sense of the word,

01:52:07.876 --> 01:52:14.638
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

01:52:15.106 --> 01:52:17.208
Sahaja means spontaneous.

01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:19.856
It comes spontaneously to you.

01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:24.433
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:28.583
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

01:52:28.853 --> 01:52:33.193
But that torsion area is there behind you,

01:52:33.272 --> 01:52:36.757
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

01:52:36.867 --> 01:52:40.171
All of you have got this, but despite that

01:52:40.298 --> 01:52:43.633
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

01:52:43.696 --> 01:52:46.692
You have that power within you.

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:50.361
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

01:52:50.603 --> 01:52:54.352
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

01:52:54.384 --> 01:52:56.679
I should we have lost him.

01:52:57.275 --> 01:53:02.282
So, one day he was going to another island

01:53:02.711 --> 01:53:06.988
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:14.315
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

01:53:15.119 --> 01:53:17.759
So he came out and he threatened them,

01:53:17.902 --> 01:53:21.404
“I am going for my Mother’s work.

01:53:21.638 --> 01:53:25.344
How dare you bring the rain?

01:53:25.509 --> 01:53:29.651
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

01:53:30.025 --> 01:53:31.874
And, it was surprising.

01:53:32.011 --> 01:53:37.069
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
came back after five hours.

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.550
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:46.575
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

01:53:46.964 --> 01:53:48.331
It helps us.

01:53:48.511 --> 01:53:52.811
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

01:53:52.993 --> 01:53:57.094
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

01:53:57.427 --> 01:54:01.662
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

01:54:01.786 --> 01:54:08.778
but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

01:54:09.021 --> 01:54:11.828
And that I am to be supported.

01:54:12.137 --> 01:54:16.844
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

01:54:17.042 --> 01:54:21.468
that you are the people who are here to

01:54:21.698 --> 01:54:26.099
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

01:54:26.126 --> 01:54:30.372
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

01:54:30.475 --> 01:54:31.759
But, how can I do it?

01:54:31.759 --> 01:54:34.358
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

01:54:34.453 --> 01:54:35.985
I have to have channels.

01:54:36.088 --> 01:54:39.228
And, these channels who know their job,

01:54:39.284 --> 01:54:44.298
they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.521
You are special people no doubt.

01:54:46.593 --> 01:54:48.853
Otherwise why are you here?

01:54:48.916 --> 01:54:58.398
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

01:54:58.588 --> 01:55:00.757
You are a wonderful conductor.

01:55:00.952 --> 01:55:02.553
You are an expert on that.

01:55:02.617 --> 01:55:04.396
It just works.

01:55:04.603 --> 01:55:11.497
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

01:55:11.902 --> 01:55:15.520
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

01:55:15.682 --> 01:55:20.356
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

01:55:20.571 --> 01:55:24.769
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

01:55:24.817 --> 01:55:27.875
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

01:55:28.086 --> 01:55:30.622
I am just an ordinary housewife.

01:55:31.622 --> 01:55:34.382
What? It’s just My love.

01:55:34.587 --> 01:55:38.722
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

01:55:39.428 --> 01:55:43.752
that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

01:55:43.975 --> 01:55:47.904
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

01:55:47.988 --> 01:55:51.319
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

01:55:51.486 --> 01:55:55.143
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:59.004
The point is, I knew what I was.

01:55:59.157 --> 01:56:03.696
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

01:56:03.942 --> 01:56:06.231
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

01:56:06.444 --> 01:56:13.064
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:17.714
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

01:56:17.841 --> 01:56:22.599
you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

01:56:22.774 --> 01:56:25.390
All these drop out like that.

01:56:25.729 --> 01:56:30.609
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

01:56:30.874 --> 01:56:37.630
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

01:56:38.664 --> 01:56:41.844
And we should get concerned about that.

01:56:42.012 --> 01:56:45.442
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

01:56:45.475 --> 01:56:47.771
I went to jail, everything I did.

01:56:47.879 --> 01:56:53.808
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:55.366
That was different.

01:56:55.544 --> 01:56:58.712
But after that independence what should have happened

01:56:58.791 --> 01:57:03.270
is to make people realize what they are.

01:57:04.047 --> 01:57:08.039
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:11.063
what is the need of that country.

01:57:11.245 --> 01:57:19.596
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

01:57:19.936 --> 01:57:24.752
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

01:57:24.816 --> 01:57:28.742
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

01:57:28.877 --> 01:57:34.763
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

01:57:35.264 --> 01:57:37.295
You are so empowered.

01:57:37.581 --> 01:57:42.573
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

01:57:42.646 --> 01:57:46.872
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

01:57:47.052 --> 01:57:50.406
But still all of you have to do it.

01:57:50.598 --> 01:57:55.556
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

01:57:55.644 --> 01:57:59.989
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

01:58:00.132 --> 01:58:03.567
I have not changed much because within Myself

01:58:03.638 --> 01:58:08.884
I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

01:58:09.313 --> 01:58:12.359
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

01:58:12.526 --> 01:58:18.424
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

01:58:18.734 --> 01:58:25.650
that nothing is important than to know what you are.

01:58:25.849 --> 01:58:28.821
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

01:58:29.152 --> 01:58:30.655
Nothing matters.

01:58:30.792 --> 01:58:33.702
What is important is to know yourself.

01:58:33.933 --> 01:58:37.848
I’m surprised very little has been written

01:58:37.984 --> 01:58:41.348
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

01:58:41.554 --> 01:58:44.085
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

01:58:44.316 --> 01:58:49.131
about Tao and meaning that what you are.

01:58:49.488 --> 01:58:52.858
Tao means what you are, and he describes

01:58:53.049 --> 01:58:58.509
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:02.112
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

01:59:02.216 --> 01:59:05.908
how to reach that state was not given. He only described

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:10.359
people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

01:59:10.462 --> 01:59:13.525
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:17.295
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

01:59:17.525 --> 01:59:20.138
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

01:59:20.254 --> 01:59:24.523
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

01:59:24.763 --> 01:59:29.328
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

01:59:29.956 --> 01:59:32.912
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

01:59:32.975 --> 01:59:35.132
he described so beautifully.

01:59:35.631 --> 01:59:40.000
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

01:59:40.222 --> 01:59:42.743
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

01:59:43.692 --> 01:59:47.843
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

01:59:47.914 --> 01:59:51.363
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

01:59:51.553 --> 01:59:55.993
it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

01:59:56.104 --> 01:59:59.631
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

01:59:59.835 --> 02:00:03.780
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.796
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

02:00:07.181 --> 02:00:09.443
that you should be in your balance.

02:00:09.596 --> 02:00:12.988
Now many people say who have given up smoking

02:00:13.131 --> 02:00:18.039
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.700
That means you have lost your maryadas.

02:00:20.850 --> 02:00:25.090
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

02:00:25.233 --> 02:00:28.439
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

02:00:28.864 --> 02:00:30.725
You must watch yourself.

02:00:30.843 --> 02:00:32.673
You call him, “Hello Mister.

02:00:32.673 --> 02:00:34.613
So now, what are you up to?”

02:00:34.722 --> 02:00:37.908
Then you will see how your mind is working.

02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:41.956
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

02:00:42.171 --> 02:00:46.752
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

02:00:47.927 --> 02:00:50.394
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

02:00:50.593 --> 02:00:53.791
that ocean is the lowest thing.

02:00:54.147 --> 02:00:58.179
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

02:00:58.345 --> 02:01:01.752
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

02:01:02.134 --> 02:01:04.923
So, it keeps at the lowest.

02:01:05.163 --> 02:01:09.229
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

02:01:09.348 --> 02:01:13.846
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

02:01:14.203 --> 02:01:18.825
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:22.559
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

02:01:22.781 --> 02:01:28.792
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

02:01:29.059 --> 02:01:32.730
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

02:01:32.895 --> 02:01:36.733
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

02:01:37.003 --> 02:01:41.993
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

02:01:42.227 --> 02:01:43.816
At the lowest point.

02:01:44.015 --> 02:01:47.916
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

02:01:48.004 --> 02:01:50.944
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

02:01:51.008 --> 02:01:53.558
But see that you are the lowest.

02:01:53.645 --> 02:01:58.793
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

02:01:58.928 --> 02:02:01.929
that everything will come to you.

02:02:02.768 --> 02:02:06.308
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

02:02:06.507 --> 02:02:11.179
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

02:02:11.290 --> 02:02:14.365
that you know that you are the highest.

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:18.028
You are the highest

02:02:18.053 --> 02:02:21.638
But you are highest because you stand at the lowest point.

02:02:22.764 --> 02:02:25.948
It’s true that I have tremendous love for the poor people.

02:02:26.756 --> 02:02:30.498
It’s true also that I have been really very much yearning to do something

02:02:30.531 --> 02:02:36.151
for that and that’s how we have started at least sixteen projects in India.

02:02:37.573 --> 02:02:44.500
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

02:02:44.775 --> 02:02:48.203
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

02:02:48.356 --> 02:02:50.766
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

02:02:51.235 --> 02:02:53.805
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

02:02:53.969 --> 02:02:56.776
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

02:02:57.002 --> 02:02:58.629
What is the problem there?

02:02:58.915 --> 02:03:02.690
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

02:03:02.738 --> 02:03:11.265
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

02:03:13.528 --> 02:03:17.937
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

02:03:18.421 --> 02:03:24.394
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

02:03:24.996 --> 02:03:30.476
Same in our country, same in your country and everybody’s country.

02:03:30.698 --> 02:03:35.526
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

02:03:35.653 --> 02:03:40.013
and we must have Sahaja Yogis who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

02:03:40.926 --> 02:03:47.349
To be very much confident of the fact that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

02:03:47.744 --> 02:03:48.865
And why not?

02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:51.971
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

02:03:52.348 --> 02:03:54.840
You are My children. You can do it.

02:03:54.989 --> 02:03:58.869
But the confidence should be there that as

02:03:59.092 --> 02:04:04.548
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

02:04:04.691 --> 02:04:08.387
because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

02:04:08.602 --> 02:04:12.281
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

02:04:12.408 --> 02:04:15.194
which stands at the lowest point.

02:04:15.916 --> 02:04:17.896
In the same way, it works out.

02:04:18.087 --> 02:04:20.693
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

02:04:20.821 --> 02:04:25.975
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:29.339
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

02:04:29.466 --> 02:04:34.238
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

02:04:34.422 --> 02:04:39.045
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

02:04:39.291 --> 02:04:42.143
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

02:04:42.309 --> 02:04:47.124
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

02:04:47.257 --> 02:04:50.837
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.373
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

02:04:54.548 --> 02:04:59.510
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

02:04:59.727 --> 02:05:03.690
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

02:05:03.886 --> 02:05:07.338
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

02:05:07.426 --> 02:05:10.195
in case your peace is established.

02:05:11.086 --> 02:05:17.100
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

02:05:17.842 --> 02:05:23.677
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

02:05:23.821 --> 02:05:27.911
and findout what is lacking.

02:05:28.307 --> 02:05:34.386
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

02:05:36.455 --> 02:05:40.610
They can explode all the myths of the world.

02:05:40.755 --> 02:05:42.221
I know that.

02:05:42.590 --> 02:05:47.792
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

02:05:47.998 --> 02:05:51.392
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

02:05:51.543 --> 02:05:56.046
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

02:05:56.236 --> 02:06:00.852
then give Me this, that you show your confidence

02:06:01.027 --> 02:06:03.461
and you work it out wherever you are.

02:06:03.649 --> 02:06:05.390
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

02:06:05.508 --> 02:06:07.111
You don’t have to change anything.

02:06:07.255 --> 02:06:11.571
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

02:06:11.651 --> 02:06:17.551
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

02:06:18.384 --> 02:06:22.770
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:28.040
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

02:06:28.183 --> 02:06:32.529
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:37.375
subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:39.120
May God Bless you.
