00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring its viewers
along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.000
The human brain is a universe within us,
and understanding its complex geography

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.800
is a grand adventure of our time,
said David Van Essen.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.040
Also, the relationship between the brain
and spirituality has been studied

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.960
by several different fields,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.400
and we are also on this very
fascinating exploration

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.000
with our esteemed guest,
Dr. Ashish Pradhan,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.920
who is a neurologist,
a meditation practitioner, and a coach.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.840
So without any delay,
I would like to welcome
Dr. Ashish on the program.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.640
Welcome, doctor.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.600
How are you?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.040
I'm very well, thanks, Monika.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.480
Glad to see you again.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.720
It's really nice always talking to you.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.880
You bring such wealth of information,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.440
and I am really looking forward
to talking to you

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.680
about the sixth energy center today.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.440
We would like to start
with that question

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.280
of the relationship between the sixth energy center
and the autonomic nervous system,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.600
and what organs the center controls.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.720
As we have seen in the first
part of this series,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.960
the first five energy centers,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.000
the way the energy center
potentially looks after the plexuses,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.120
and through the plexuses

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.280
of the autonomic nervous system
has influence over various organs

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.480
within the body.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.800
So today, we are going to talk about again,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.960
a very important,
critical center.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.400
So this is the sixth energy center,
the so-called Agnya chakra.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.040
A lot has been written about it
in multiple spiritual treatises,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.440
It is also referred to
as the third eye in spirituality.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.880
The Agnya chakra,
or the sixth energy center,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.520
is, as all of these energy centers go,
very, very subtle.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.720
It is located at a midpoint,
one might say,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.960
if we draw a line from the center
of the forehead to the back,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.840
and from the top of the ears,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.920
where it crosses,
at that intersection deep within our brain.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.720
The physical manifestation
of this energy center,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.920
not the energy center itself,
but the manifestation of this,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.920
could be in the form of the optic chiasma.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.200
What is optic chiasma?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.800
So, we have our eyes
and the retina

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.560
that is at the back of the eye,
that is the back end.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.240
From the retina, you have nerves,
and these nerves have their cell bodies.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.760
The axons from these bodies
form the nerves,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.040
which together make up the optic nerve.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.680
The optic nerve is a collection
of these axons, or these long tails.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.440
And the optic nerves from each,
the left and the right eye,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.560
they go back and they cross over.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.960
That's called optic chiasma.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.360
And they cross over and then they go
and they terminate at the back of the brain,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.760
in what is called the occipital cortex.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.360
So the impulses from the eye,
the light that goes in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.440
through our pupils falls on the retina,
creates a chemical reaction,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.560
and that impulse travels back
and through the various connections that it has,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.480
it interprets vision,
or what it is that we are seeing.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.360
So the physical manifestation
is considered to be the optic chiasma,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.440
but that's not the energy center.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.080
This energy center
controls our eyes,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.480
our vision in terms of what it sees,
what it interprets.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.400
So that's the first part.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.920
The second organ this energy center
relates to is the master,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.160
or the conductor of the orchestra.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.440
You see, like a big philharmonic orchestra,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.200
there is a conductor -
and that conductor is the hypothalamus.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.000
The hypothalamus is a very small organ
situated in the middle of our brain.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.400
And we'll talk more about it also
in the context of the limbic system,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.320
which is the seven so-called
energy center complex.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.200
But the hypothalamus is an organ
that sits at the crossroads

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.160
between the endocrine system
and the nervous system.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.520
So it secretes a number of hormones.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.480
And these hormones in turn control
other endocrine organs,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.080
such as the pituitary,
such as the adrenal cortex,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.800
such as the male and the female
reproductive endocrine systems

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.480
that give rise to the ovarian cycle
or the spermatogenesis in males,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.160
ovarian cycles in females.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.240
So the hypothalamus
has four or five key functions.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.120
And the first one is to maintain
the internal homeostasis

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.680
by regulating the temperature
and the basic biological functions

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.840
through the autonomic nervous system.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.480
So that includes our blood pressure,
that includes our thirst,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.960
our hunger or our appetite.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.640
It controls our urges.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.280
It regulates our
body temperature as well.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.680
It has endocrine functions,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.640
and through the hormones it secretes,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.720
it also controls
the autonomic nervous system

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.200
via these secretions.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.040
So say, for example,
the adrenal cortex secretes cortisol,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.120
and that is our stress hormone.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.680
So flight and fight reactions, for example,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.840
which is a very well-known response
within human physiology,

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.120
you see something that is a grave danger,
you run away from it.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.080
Or if it is something you want to overcome,
you fight it.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.440
So all of these are controlled
through this hormonal system.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.000
The hormonal system receives input -

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.440
the hypothalamus gets signals
from multiple nervous systems.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.400
This enables it

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.160
to control the functioning
of the body.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.680
And that hypothalamus is believed to be
under the control of this sixth energy center.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.680
So you can say that the sixth energy center
practically is the lord and master

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.320
or mistress of the autonomic nervous system.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.800
So as part of this series,
we have now reached a point

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.640
where we talk about the master control
of this entire orchestra,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.800
and that is the hypothalamus.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.920
So that is another
very important organ

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.680
that this center refers to.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.360
The third organ that we would want to
consider in this context

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.200
is the pineal gland.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.200
The pineal gland is a very, very small body
that also sits very close to the hypothalamus.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.840
And this pineal body
secretes a hormone you're all familiar with,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.360
it's called melatonin.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.520
And melatonin
controls our sleep cycle.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.640
It's extremely important.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.640
Anyone who's crossed time zones
knows jet lag -

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.840
it's caused by the circadian rhythm,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.600
the 24-hour sleep cycle
controlled by melatonin.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.240
As the sun goes down,
as the light goes down,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.040
melatonin secretion
starts going up.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.320
And that is controlled
by the pineal gland.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:47.840
So within that framework,
if we go back to the Sahaj subtle system,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.760
you have the left side,
which is the so-called passive side,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.760
you have the right side,
the so-called active side

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.560
that we have in the subtle system
within our body,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.360
and then of course, the evolutionary side,
which is the central channel.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.200
So you can see how there is a beautiful
correlation between the function

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.160
of the hypothalamus by regulating
the body's requirements.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.040
In the morning, we feel hungry,
at night, not so much after we have had the day,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.840
the whole body temperature actually
starts falling down towards the evening,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.200
and it reaches its lowest temperature at night,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.040
which is why we sleep better
in the cooler environments.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.360
If it's very hot,
we can't sleep very well.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.600
And it is also believed that when
the body temperature starts going down,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.800
it starts inducing
the state that we call sleep,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.920
that we just lie down and go to sleep.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.960
Through this energy center,
we can say that

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.920
by monitoring our internal body
through the autonomic nervous system,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.720
by managing our sleep cycle,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:08.880
it manages our both:
passive behaviors such as sleep

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.200
but also the active side,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.600
which happens during the daytime,
when melatonin levels are very low.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.400
So it is this magnificently managed control,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.960
extremely finely done by regulation
of the nervous system

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.670
to these two or 
three organs that relate

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.520
to the sixth energy center.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.280
As laymen we seldom
get a chance to understand

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.880
or admire these complex communications,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.160
rhythms and patterns
that have been designed into us.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.000
This is really very, very
wonderful information, Dr. Ashish.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.240
We would like to know
the evolutionary significance

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.640
and where the center is most likely located?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.400
So this center - hypothalamus -
as you can imagine,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.600
the regulation of the body of an organism
was a requirement

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.520
from an evolutionary point of view,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.920
it's putting maybe
the cart before the horse

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.920
or effect before the cause.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.240
But even as we start looking at again,
the aquatic life forms,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.080
and then amphibians and early terrestrial,
so on and so forth,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.840
as the bodies became more complex,
multicellular with more

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.960
and more defined organ systems,
cardiovascular system,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.520
respiratory system,
digestive system,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:38.480
they needed a master control
over that organism so as to survive.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.720
If any of these systems are not well controlled,
it can go out of whack,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.240
and then that starts creating its own issues.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.560
So which is why 
the hypothalamus is believed

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.960
that hypothalamic nuclei,
like any organ in the brain,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.800
is like anything else,
it's just a group of cells.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.480
So anything in the brain is composed
of cells that are called neurons.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.320
The hypothalamic neurons,
maybe not the organ,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.040
but the neurons have been found
in very primitive life forms as well.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:17.520
So that is the evolutionary relevance
of this particular energy center, if you will,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.880
as manifest through the existence
of the anatomical organ,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.760
which is manifest in vertebrates,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.520
and particularly, of course,
in the Homo sapiens as hypothalamus.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.880
So its evolutionary significance is profound,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.880
without the hypothalamus
or a hypothalamic like body,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.520
controlling the entirety
of our vegetative functions,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.000
which is why we don't have to think
about how many times our heart has to beat,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.040
we don't have to think

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.960
what should be the force
of the digestive propulsive forces?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.960
How many times should we breathe?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.960
What is the extent of breathing?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.120
All of these functions,
that is circulatory system,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.280
respiratory system
or digestive system,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.080
and the thousands and thousands
of processes in the body that are controlled,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.800
that needed that sort of system -
you can think of it as,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.520
as almost like a fly-by-wire technology
that exists now in modern aircraft,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.760
but the pilot doesn't really have to think,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.720
just switches on as a master computer
that takes over

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.840
and on a second to second,
not even a minute to minute,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.480
just as the aircraft maintains its altitude,
its speed, its direction,

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.400
that's exactly how
the hypothalamus functions.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.720
And that is its evolutionary significance.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.480
It has evolved to allow us to survive

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.480
without having to put in a lot
of cognitive effort,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.120
conscious effort into our survival.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.680
So that's basically
its evolutionary importance.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.840
It is located

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.480
just maybe below the optic chiasma
that we spoke about.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.240
And it is again, very difficult
to maybe just pinpoint

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.560
because it exists in the form of energy.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.280
We discussed that in one
of the first episodes.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.840
So these don't exist
in the state of matter,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.160
but it's most likely situated, as we said,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.720
you draw a straight line
from the middle of her forehead,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.440
right at the back, and then 
from across from the top of her ears.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.200
And where these two lines
will intersect somewhere in the middle,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.560
just below the optic chiasma in that area

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.320
is where near the hypothalamus is probably
where this energy center is located.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.160
I really like the analogies that you use
to explain complex concepts,

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.680
because if we do not have a lot 
of science background,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.120
it just gets so much easier for us
to just understand that whole concept.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.600
That's very, very beautifully explained, doctor.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.400
When we come to
the functioning of the center,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.760
how does it relate to
the maintenance of balance

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.800
within a human being?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.760
And is there, is this related
to a direct control of actions, emotions,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.280
the active passive aspects
of human behavior?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.080
Absolutely.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.000
So as we said, the neuroendocrine system
is closely linked to —

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.640
there's so much literature on stress
and stress management

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.360
and what causes stress
and whether stress is even

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.600
a physiologically good thing to have
because it is something called eustress,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.440
distress, so on and so forth.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.200
But when we look at the normal
physiologic functioning of a human being,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:38.160
it comprises a minute to minute
or even a second to second awareness

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.000
of our own selves as well as
that of our surroundings.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.240
And it brings into focus our attention,
our memories,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.440
and we'll talk about this, of course,
in the next episode as well.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.840
Our memories, attention, our awareness,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.360
our place within the universe around us,

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.760
whether it is our societies,
whether it is our families,

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.600
whether it is our workplaces.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.680
And in this minute to minute, literally,
existential sort of environment,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.640
we react, we respond.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.880
And we respond in a way
that is a very complex integral,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.800
if you will, of who we are as individuals.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.440
And who we are as individuals
is again a function of our collective past,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.920
our individual past, our cultures,
our ethnic identities,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.960
our languages, our geographies,
where we come from,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.760
the way we were raised,
not everybody's raised the same.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:46.080
So whoever we are, this huge amalgam
of our memories,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:53.840
of our conditionings, all are governed by
what constitutes the brain.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.880
And within the brain, it is this energy center
that plays a particular role,

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.080
because it is also related
to the notion of ego and superego.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.200
And we have these two institutions,
there are other videos

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.400
that Sahaja Yoga gives us, that speak to it,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.280
but it gives you that sense of I-ness
versus the others.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.920
And that is where this energy center
comes into play.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.440
So in individuals who are well balanced,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.360
'balanced' is more
of a metaphorical term

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:31.600
or of a spiritual term,
but individuals who do not react

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.160
unnecessarily or excessively,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.560
if you see a cat and you start running
in the opposite direction, that's a problem.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.960
If you see a tiger and you start running
in the opposite direction, not a problem.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.360
Why?

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.960
Because although they both belong
to the cat family,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.920
those are two
very different situations.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.600
So that is where this center
comes into play.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.440
And if there are individuals who react
in a very different way,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.480
in these kinds of situations,
those are very generic situations,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.840
very obvious ones.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.680
But that is what defines a healthy state
of this energy center versus not.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.000
And therefore, it is very important
to keep this energy center

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.400
in a very healthy state
or might say in a balanced state

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.160
by developing through
the Sahaj meditation process,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.080
what we call a balanced, forgiving
and a charitably disposed personality.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.240
Because that way, as you can now see
the function of the hypothalamus,

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.680
it does not have to secrete these hormones
that will raise your blood pressure,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.560
that will raise your heart rate,
that will allow you to react more aggressively

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.120
to an environment which you perceive
to be aggressive,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.640
which may not be aggressive,
which may not be threatening to you.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.160
So life then becomes more a matter
of perception rather than reality.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.560
And the calibration of one's response
to that environment

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.920
is what defines an individual
from being relatively

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.480
what we call in conventional terms
as reactive, immature,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.600
to somebody who is, we say,
more mature, sagacious.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.280
So think of a Lincoln
or a Gandhi like personality

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:23.440
relative to somebody who is
much more reactive or gets easily ruffled,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.680
we say, we just know some people
who are just calm, more composed,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.160
they don't react that negatively
or excessively.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.600
And that is where it kind of comes in,
the importance of this center

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:44.160
to maintain that balance within us,
right action and right behavior.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.120
It does not mean
we remain constantly passive.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.223
It does not mean
we remain constantly active.

00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:52.000
Where is that fine balance?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.640
How do you calibrate
back to that aircraft?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.280
How do you maintain your speed,
your altitude and your course

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.480
from a, shall we say,
an emotional perspective

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:08.080
or from a spiritual perspective
is what this center is really about.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.720
And that's why it plays such a vital role
in human spirituality.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.520
Thank you, Dr. Ashish, for bringing up
that very wonderful point,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.760
a very relevant point about
the level of reactions that we all may have.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.200
And it is for each of us to,
just look inside us, look around us

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.600
to see where we find just giving reactions
more than needed.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.200
Like you explained with the example
of the cat and the tiger responses

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.520
to a similar situation
or a different situation,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.960
how they need to be.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.000
But this is something that we are seeing
a lot around us on social media

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
and different platforms.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.880
So, anything that you want
to add to that

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.640
just so that we can be more aware
of our surroundings,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.440
our environments where we are?

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.240
Fabulous. That's such a great point,
Monika,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.800
if we think of our evolution,

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.040
but we don't have to go back
to the aquatic stage.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.920
Just about 100 years ago,
just about 50 years ago,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.360
there was no social media,

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.960
television and media did not play
such a big role in our lives.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.720
People had a much more
quote-unquote pastoral lifestyle,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.640
certainly pre-industrial societies.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:27.120
But even in post-industrial societies,
it was not that much of a deal.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.560
This influence of media
and the environment around us,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.800
there were communities,
there were neighbors,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:41.360
but with the advent of social media,
particularly, life has become very reactive.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.600
You are part of some kind of
a social media platform,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.080
whichever it is, with your friends,
with your office colleagues or neighbours,

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.880
as the case may be,
you read a post about a topic,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.960
whether it is political, whether it is social,
whether it is cultural,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.240
and the brain processes it.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.600
Within our brain is a very
important group

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.480
of neurotransmitters -
one of them is dopamine.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.200
Dopamine is a pleasure giving molecule.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.880
Whenever we do or feel
something pleasurable,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.280
there is a part of the brain called
a substantia nigra that secretes dopamine.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.320
Dopamine gives us that high, that rush.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.000
And where social media comes in,
social media algorithms.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.680
I'm not a tech expert,
but I saw a couple of documentaries,

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.960
and they explained beautifully
that there is a full blown understanding

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:47.600
of the human nervous system,
and particularly of how the dopamine

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.800
system works to produce that rush.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:23:00.400
So we are constantly through algorithms
that are designed to generate that rush within us.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.520
So we are constantly hooked onto it.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:08.480
We are given content or fed content
that is based on these algorithms

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.000
that grab our attention and hold it.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.440
And that is where this center is also
where it's damaged the most,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.320
because it keeps us on this endless loop.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:26.560
We are essentially like animals
that are on treadmills,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.680
that you're constantly fed
that morphine of information, if you will,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.880
and that triggers dopamine within us.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.560
And that gives us that sense of high
and that high keeps us hooked onto social media.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:50.160
So the Agnya Chakra or the sixth energy center
probably in the entirety of human civilization,

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.320
recorded and unrecorded history,
and this is not a hyperbole,

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:59.200
I genuinely feel it has never probably
been more stressed due to social media.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.480
But what is the solution?

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.000
It's easy to identify a problem,
but then what is the solution?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.120
The solution is that through meditation,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.160
we can begin to stay away from that rush.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.080
We don't need that rush.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.320
You don't need to constantly feel
your presence on social media

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:23.280
or see what is the
latest post out there?

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.320
Or if you posted something,
has somebody read it or not?

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.080
How many likes have you received?

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.680
Or have you not received it?

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.560
So if you have not received anything,
no responses,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.360
you kind of go down and then
that dopamine rush goes down,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.720
you'll start feeling depressed.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.120
And we see this particularly in teenagers,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.240
which is why the US Congress
is acting very wisely.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:47.680
So to try to see if these
social media platforms

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.878
can actually be modulated

00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:55.489
to avoid creating mental health issues

00:24:55.489 --> 00:24:59.920
for susceptible age groups
such as teenagers,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.120
whose use can lead to extreme outcomes.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.240
So yes, that's a phenomenal point
that you raised.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.360
And this energy center in particular
plays a very critical role

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.480
in either being susceptible
and being influenced by social media.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.240
But then through meditative practice,
such as the Sahaj meditation,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.240
you can actually maintain
a healthy boundary.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.600
So nobody's saying here,
you should not interact with social media,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.640
not use social media,
social media is a way of life now.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.160
We all have to live with it.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.400
The question is how and to what extent?

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.120
And I think with what you have shared,
it seems like,

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.720
with this meditation, not only an individual
is going to benefit,

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.360
in the ability
to self-regulate themselves,

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.360
it'll also impact the society at large.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.680
Think about it like,
if each of us just gets a little bit better

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.200
in terms of how we react,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.920
it's really going to impact the health
of the society as well.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.440
Thank you, Dr. Ashish.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.920
Thank you so much for this
very wonderful information.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.600
And we look forward to speaking
to you again soon next time.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.680
Thank you Monika, thanks for having me.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.400
Thank you.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.080
We would encourage
our audiences to follow

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.280
the guided meditation video
by the founder of this meditation,

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.200
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.960
And do join us next time
for yet another exciting conversation

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.640
with Dr. Ashish Pradhan.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.097
Thank you.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:38.700
Shri Mataji: Today we are going to understand
the center of Agnya,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:48.220
Agnya chakra which is placed
on the crossing of the optic chiasma.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:56.700
The nerves that supply the eyes
go backwards in the opposite direction,

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:06.620
and wherever they cross,
this subtle center is situated.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.660
It has a continuous connection
with the other center

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.500
through the medulla oblongata.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:37.020
This center has got two petals
and this subtle center on one side

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:48.860
acts through the eyes and at the back
of the head where you have some protrusion.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.340
This is the physical side of the center.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:28:03.642
The people who talk of the third eye,
this is the third eye.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.000
Keep your eyes closed.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.880
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.880
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:34.200
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.840
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.950
This is a very fundamental question.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:06.200
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.120
in the upper part.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.480
Here press it.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:19.960
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.360
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.680
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:32.511
Mother, am I my own master?

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:52.440
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:30:00.120
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.920
all the pure work is done.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:08.040
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.720
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.920
Six times you just ask.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:22.151
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:37.800
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.960
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:51.160
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.840
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:03.560
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.800
This you have to say ten times.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.840
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.575
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:56.360
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:06.440
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:13.320
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.720
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.120
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:23.560
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.316
This you have to say twelve times.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:02.920
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.800
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.640
So He forgives.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.280
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:19.960
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:28.440
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.600
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.360
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.640
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.080
Sixteen times.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.443
I am not guilty at all.

00:33:46.443 --> 00:33:54.579
Please say it.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:34.120
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:44.920
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.160
Please say it from your heart.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.240
How many times is not the point.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.640
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.320
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:03.240
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.120
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.120
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:17.108
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:31.720
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:36.760
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:44.120
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:50.600
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.910
please forgive me.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:08.120
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:14.680
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:23.480
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.680
Press it hard.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.200
Press hard your scalp.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.440
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.720
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.440
So you have to ask for it.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:51.000
Seven times press it hard
and move it seven times very hard.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.294
Slowly saying that.
