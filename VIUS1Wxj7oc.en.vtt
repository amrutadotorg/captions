WEBVTT

00:06.523 --> 00:09.805
and the three processes

00:09.862 --> 00:13.182
through which we pass.

00:15.366 --> 00:17.859
First is the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:19.415 --> 00:24.340
Actually, this is celebrated mostly on the thirteenth day

00:25.047 --> 00:28.465
of the moon, where they say that

00:28.571 --> 00:32.379
the housewife has to be given some present.

00:34.819 --> 00:38.848
And the best thing she can have is a some sort of an utensil.

00:39.574 --> 00:44.305
So people give her some utensils, actually

00:44.330 --> 00:46.330
it’s a very mutual thing, because

00:46.464 --> 00:50.622
if you give an utensil, she is supposed to cook for you.

00:55.205 --> 00:59.520
It’s a very sweet way of suggesting that you cook something for us.

01:02.469 --> 01:06.426
Then the fourteenth day is very important,

01:06.932 --> 01:15.614
because that is the day the Goddess as a power,

01:16.142 --> 01:22.763
as a power, because it was Kartikeya who killed Narakasura, the devil.

01:25.083 --> 01:30.485
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.

01:32.538 --> 01:36.667
So Shiva and Parvati were married

01:36.750 --> 01:41.968
for this special purpose to produce this powerful Shaktiputra,

01:41.999 --> 01:46.120
means the son of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

01:48.005 --> 01:51.567
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil,

01:53.143 --> 01:54.503
called as Narakasura.

01:55.709 --> 02:00.468
And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day.

02:01.017 --> 02:03.670
It is something like Halloween, that day.

02:03.695 --> 02:05.695
Because that is the day they opened

02:06.239 --> 02:12.820
the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.

02:13.260 --> 02:19.140
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible.

02:19.390 --> 02:22.990
So that let all the devils be put in nicely

02:23.268 --> 02:27.357
because some of them might be hanging around still.

02:28.017 --> 02:31.207
It’s better to allow them to get out.

02:31.751 --> 02:34.230
I mean in the realm that you are

02:34.456 --> 02:36.943
you do not feel much their existence.

02:37.110 --> 02:41.064
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or collective subconscious,

02:42.630 --> 02:45.206
people see even some of the spirits

02:45.276 --> 02:47.281
and also can feel their existence,

02:47.361 --> 02:49.221
they see the black spots and all that.

02:51.388 --> 02:55.359
So that day is very dangerous,

02:55.706 --> 02:59.088
but because Narakasura was killed,

03:01.037 --> 03:03.126
people celebrated.

03:03.225 --> 03:08.301
That celebration is expressed next day,

03:08.446 --> 03:12.988
which that day is the day of Diwali they say.

03:13.027 --> 03:16.951
That is the day they also worship Lakshmi, because

03:17.826 --> 03:20.300
they think that

03:20.463 --> 03:22.512
that’s the day Lakshmi was born on this earth

03:24.306 --> 03:27.913
from the sea as I told you last time.

03:29.923 --> 03:33.530
Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards,

03:35.247 --> 03:38.439
because in India in the north,

03:38.650 --> 03:41.842
that’s the time people finish their crops

03:42.659 --> 03:47.523
and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year.

03:48.571 --> 03:49.309
And,

03:52.235 --> 03:58.238
that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India,

03:58.495 --> 04:00.784
we need not use that,

04:01.553 --> 04:05.998
what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south,

04:06.333 --> 04:11.023
say in Maharastra they have another New Year, as I told you where

04:11.323 --> 04:15.842
Shalivahana in his dynasty started another

04:16.159 --> 04:18.566
calendar and they celebrate that.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.932
So all these things are nothing is rigid

04:22.666 --> 04:25.297
about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid.

04:26.265 --> 04:28.896
Rigidity comes from ignorance.

04:29.572 --> 04:32.715
It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness.

04:32.974 --> 04:35.501
The whole festival system is for your happiness

04:35.686 --> 04:39.308
and not for the happiness of the time or date.

04:39.619 --> 04:43.633
It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your

04:44.796 --> 04:47.708
needs and understanding.

04:49.067 --> 04:51.979
And also according to your

04:53.163 --> 04:55.203
national way you live.

04:55.396 --> 04:59.343
They should be no addiction to any

04:59.360 --> 05:04.192
particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas.

05:04.524 --> 05:07.905
It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for gods.

05:08.184 --> 05:09.828
They don’t have these festivals.

05:10.236 --> 05:13.143
It’s only for you people these festivals are there.

05:13.368 --> 05:17.286
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness.

05:17.645 --> 05:20.103
And that’s how you should celebrate in a way

05:20.326 --> 05:24.082
that gives you the greatest amount of happiness.

05:24.562 --> 05:28.589
And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

05:28.901 --> 05:31.461
The more you are festive, the happier it is.

05:32.238 --> 05:34.852
Why miss the chance, you see.

05:35.245 --> 05:40.883
So as Sahaja Yogis you can celebrate, you can’t put yourselves in yawn.

05:53.866 --> 05:57.543
So as a Sahaja Yogi you don’t belong to any particular

05:57.653 --> 06:01.020
caste or community anymore now, you belong to universal caste.

06:01.216 --> 06:04.595
Once you start belonging to the universal thing,

06:04.801 --> 06:07.846
then you can celebrate all the festivals of all the religions.

06:08.046 --> 06:09.797
And have the best of it.

06:11.717 --> 06:15.247
All the year out, you can celebrate all the festivals. Know about them,

06:15.479 --> 06:17.609
the more you know, the better it is.

06:18.242 --> 06:20.334
And have all kinds of sweets,

06:20.544 --> 06:23.923
whatever you use, whatever type you use, in whatever

06:24.229 --> 06:27.625
areas and countries and cultures. And that’s how

06:27.598 --> 06:33.580
we have to be more festive.

06:34.785 --> 06:38.180
Now the last day is very important,

06:38.329 --> 06:41.175
is a very universal day I should say, called as

06:41.393 --> 06:44.788
Bhaiya Duja, this day,

06:44.754 --> 06:47.536
or they call it also in Marathi Vao Dijum,

06:48.001 --> 06:51.396
different names. The brothers and sisters day.

06:55.713 --> 07:01.517
Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship

07:02.273 --> 07:07.523
has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship

07:08.057 --> 07:09.459
is to be maintained.

07:10.599 --> 07:14.110
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters,

07:14.470 --> 07:15.553
not necessary.

07:16.314 --> 07:19.463
But you are born, because if you are

07:19.631 --> 07:22.510
realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters.

07:23.111 --> 07:26.989
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.

07:27.489 --> 07:33.386
Very important, that we should try to develop this

07:33.733 --> 07:39.166
situation that brothers and sisters

07:39.490 --> 07:44.452
are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.986
And they should not be at all challenged.

07:50.391 --> 07:53.915
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother,

07:54.463 --> 07:59.202
he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship,

07:59.554 --> 08:04.434
the better your left Vishuddhi will be. Because left Vishuddhi

08:04.576 --> 08:08.623
is the relationship with God as a brother

08:08.870 --> 08:11.427
or with a Goddess as a sister.

08:12.678 --> 08:17.745
So, Shri Krishna’s sister, as you know was

08:17.991 --> 08:21.443
born to Nand

08:21.687 --> 08:25.138
and Shri Krishna himself was born in a prison.

08:25.632 --> 08:29.083
So there was an exchange that took place.

08:29.945 --> 08:34.921
They had to replace Her in His place.

08:37.593 --> 08:40.881
And then when Kamsa,

08:40.973 --> 08:46.965
the uncle of Krishna, tried to kill that girl,

08:47.224 --> 08:49.224
She went into the sky

08:49.868 --> 08:54.321
and like a lightning She said that “Your killer is still living in Gokul,

08:54.666 --> 08:58.925
is still there.” So this lightning that we see,

08:59.381 --> 09:02.665
is representative of that power,

09:02.993 --> 09:07.903
which we call as Vishnumaya, is the sister’s. If your sisterly feelings

09:08.097 --> 09:11.643
towards women are good and strong,

09:13.753 --> 09:17.212
your left Vishuddhi will be very good.

09:17.616 --> 09:19.616
It has many other qualities.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.863
For example a person, who has a very good left Vishuddi,

09:23.616 --> 09:25.616
is a very confident person.

09:27.110 --> 09:30.192
Not only that, but whatever he says comes out true.

09:33.335 --> 09:35.866
Even by mistake, he says something, it comes true.

09:37.568 --> 09:40.881
It’s a very powerful center left Vishuddhi is.

09:42.796 --> 09:51.459
Such a person, whenever he speaks to, say, criticize something

09:52.202 --> 09:55.722
or to cut down something or to be against something,

09:56.189 --> 09:59.271
then it has the power to crash

10:00.299 --> 10:06.170
all that he doesn’t want. See like, you can say

10:07.554 --> 10:10.726
Christ, His left Vishuddhi

10:10.990 --> 10:14.872
is expressed through His relationship with Mary Magdalene.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.183
When He stood up and said that

10:21.874 --> 10:26.482
“Those who have not committed any sin can stone her,” so this is His power.

10:28.247 --> 10:33.411
The sin of the people just crashed them completely;

10:33.478 --> 10:36.967
they were finished, because the sin was there. And the sin was

10:37.189 --> 10:42.486
of left Vishuddhi. There was no purity. And when there is no purity,

10:42.704 --> 10:45.525
the person who is so pure says such a thing,

10:45.943 --> 10:50.036
all these people lost their powers; they couldn’t even stone.

10:51.850 --> 10:57.226
Now this sister of His was born later on as Draupadi

10:57.873 --> 11:01.230
and that to very near the place we have been to, Vani,

11:01.338 --> 11:06.152
you know, where we saw. Gavin do you remember when we were going to Nagpur?

11:06.315 --> 11:14.157
Near Vani she was born, that place and there’s a very big temple of that.

11:14.997 --> 11:20.141
She was called as Draupadi and you know how Shri Krishna tried to save

11:20.219 --> 11:22.219
Her chastity.

11:23.336 --> 11:26.961
Now people,

11:28.196 --> 11:33.400
I have heard, are trying also to say things against Mary Magdalene

11:33.778 --> 11:38.074
and against Christ and all kinds of things, you see. This is the sign of

11:38.091 --> 11:42.144
the decadence of our brains and of our morality

11:42.265 --> 11:45.830
that we cannot see purity in any relationship.

11:47.309 --> 11:50.593
We cannot see any purity in any relationship.

11:51.609 --> 11:54.502
So we as sahaja yogis have to develop

11:55.002 --> 11:59.140
more of that. Instead of that what I find that people,

11:59.640 --> 12:03.355
specially in the West, try to think whom we are going to marry whom.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.095
These relationships are established, is wrong.

12:09.272 --> 12:12.715
There is no need to go on organizing marriages

12:12.875 --> 12:16.071
and playing these games of romance and all that.

12:16.935 --> 12:19.077
If marriage has to take place, it will take place.

12:19.577 --> 12:21.760
But don’t spoil the atmosphere.

12:21.850 --> 12:24.225
There are some people who are just like

12:25.226 --> 12:28.590
barbers, who try to organize marriages

12:29.682 --> 12:32.166
you see and take a great pride in arranging marriages

12:32.165 --> 12:34.499
with this one to that one and that one to that one.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.616
Is not a desirable thing; one should not do it. There’s no

12:40.574 --> 12:44.141
virtue in these things, is to organize marriages all the time.

12:45.005 --> 12:47.005
When the marriage time comes,

12:47.004 --> 12:47.955
it takes place.

12:48.683 --> 12:50.683
Now at the time of Mohammed Sahib

12:51.775 --> 12:57.908
a big question arose, because there were very few man

12:58.049 --> 13:00.741
many ladies of all age groups.

13:01.241 --> 13:03.429
And they didn’t know what to do, how to save these girls

13:03.701 --> 13:06.391
because so many men died in the war.

13:07.665 --> 13:12.510
So then they asked, “What to do now at this juncture in a position, when such

13:13.647 --> 13:15.962
a catastrophe is there and so many women are

13:16.007 --> 13:19.389
there, and very, very few men?” Then He said, “All right, you can marry

13:19.616 --> 13:23.379
four or five wives and you can marry in any age group.”

13:23.469 --> 13:25.469
Because if you have to

13:25.969 --> 13:30.066
live with dharma, means marriage, means collective sanction,

13:30.566 --> 13:32.566
not without marriage.

13:32.747 --> 13:34.747
So He said, “All right, you can even marry five times,

13:35.202 --> 13:37.577
but you must marry, without marriage you cannot live.”

13:40.080 --> 13:42.080
And that is why He was particular

13:42.580 --> 13:46.546
that every person should be married and should have no relationship

13:46.591 --> 13:47.978
without marriage, was sin.

13:49.546 --> 13:51.563
Instead of that now Muslims think that it

13:51.608 --> 13:52.866
is there right to marry five persons.

13:52.911 --> 13:55.279
I mean, when the men are more and women are less.

13:57.918 --> 14:01.056
Is a wrong thing. You have to find out the solution.

14:01.419 --> 14:05.918
And at that time the relationship between

14:06.929 --> 14:10.149
even the sisters and brothers had to delimit,

14:10.649 --> 14:11.997
because there was a big problem.

14:12.648 --> 14:17.644
So He said, “All right, the children born of the same parents cannot marry,

14:18.144 --> 14:20.927
but cousins could marry,” that time.

14:22.656 --> 14:25.034
Now that time is changed, all right,

14:25.534 --> 14:27.629
it’s not that time. We are not on war,

14:28.129 --> 14:31.488
there is nothing happening like that. There is no such problem.

14:31.988 --> 14:33.988
So let us develop now our

14:34.943 --> 14:37.920
pure relationship of brothers and sisters.

14:38.056 --> 14:40.768
Actually, first time when we had this

14:40.995 --> 14:43.716
this Diwali function, I asked people

14:44.216 --> 14:46.216
to find one sister for yourself.

14:46.944 --> 14:48.944
Every gentleman must have one sister,

14:50.172 --> 14:57.643
to find out one. And then that is the day, I said, let us start this way

14:57.824 --> 15:03.651
that next time when we meet on another day called as

15:05.380 --> 15:07.380
Rakhi Purnima,

15:07.561 --> 15:11.158
that you tie the rakhi in the hand, the same brothers and sisters.

15:12.386 --> 15:14.891
In India also we did like that and it worked very well.

15:15.391 --> 15:19.366
But there the relationships are so strong. Once Dhumal, you see,

15:19.866 --> 15:22.959
I think tied it to Raulbai.

15:23.277 --> 15:26.040
And now even if I say something to Raulbai, he doesn’t like.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.928
It exceeded to that extent. It’s so sweet you know.

15:30.428 --> 15:34.839
And even Dhumal’s wife respects Raulbai as an elder sister, you see.

15:35.066 --> 15:39.011
It’s very sweet. Like that many relationships are established.

15:39.511 --> 15:41.179
And next year I think Raulbai

15:41.360 --> 15:45.614
became the sister of one of our trustees, who was no more there.

15:45.977 --> 15:48.352
And she always carried on all that

15:48.397 --> 15:51.593
relationship, and they also, I mean imagine.

15:52.093 --> 15:56.506
The whole thing is that, that relationship is so special,

15:57.006 --> 15:59.006
so close and so pure.

16:02.237 --> 16:04.237
And such a relationship one should develop

16:04.965 --> 16:07.671
with a lady, any woman

16:08.171 --> 16:11.360
or any friend you want to have.

16:12.998 --> 16:14.799
One should remember that it cannot

16:14.980 --> 16:17.477
cross a certain limit, there has to have a maryada.

16:17.522 --> 16:19.331
Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters

16:19.330 --> 16:20.964
and then they marry, it’s not possible.

16:22.784 --> 16:25.654
So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important.

16:26.154 --> 16:28.383
In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas

16:28.382 --> 16:32.453
and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody

16:32.484 --> 16:36.339
brother or a sister, is absolutely pure relationship.

16:37.612 --> 16:39.424
Little further we’ll go with that

16:39.696 --> 16:43.425
and that the relationship with a, as I have told you before,

16:43.925 --> 16:50.224
that with your, say, husband’s younger brothers

16:50.724 --> 16:53.318
is just like that they are like your younger brothers,

16:53.454 --> 16:55.734
all of them, husband’s younger brothers

16:56.234 --> 16:58.906
or younger Sahaja yogis than your husbands, are.

16:59.690 --> 17:01.690
The other way round is for all the ladies,

17:07.323 --> 17:14.638
we can say, all the men, their wives, elder ladies, elder to your wives,

17:15.138 --> 17:17.998
are like sisters, elder sisters.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.612
I mean this relationship is so sweet and

17:22.112 --> 17:24.560
gives you a certain amount of understanding

17:24.654 --> 17:27.232
how much distance is kept with whom,

17:27.489 --> 17:29.811
with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance.

17:30.311 --> 17:33.043
And this must be maintained with such a beautiful way

17:33.178 --> 17:36.993
that this purity is not corrupted.

17:37.817 --> 17:42.153
You keep to pure standards. This is

17:42.653 --> 17:45.705
the nourishment of Sahaja yoga, is the nourishment

17:45.962 --> 17:47.962
of your growth, purity.

17:48.178 --> 17:50.961
Purity is the most important thing for us,

17:51.461 --> 17:59.397
purity in every way. If you are pure, you will not do anything

17:59.853 --> 18:08.263
that is, we can say, that is not pure.

18:10.264 --> 18:12.060
So first of all you’ll be pure yourself

18:12.560 --> 18:15.290
and you’ll accept purity, you’ll appreciate purity,

18:15.628 --> 18:19.323
you will be sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate

18:19.945 --> 18:23.632
or try to compromise with you.

18:25.227 --> 18:29.544
That’s why purity is your Mother’s name.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.409
You know that My name is purity.

18:32.747 --> 18:36.881
And this purity is such that it pures everything,

18:37.381 --> 18:38.856
it just purifies.

18:39.032 --> 18:41.729
The purity should be such that it should purify,

18:43.527 --> 18:45.527
otherwise that purity has no meaning.

18:46.351 --> 18:50.998
For example, a soap purifies, all right. But you don’t purify the soap.

18:52.431 --> 18:55.966
Do you clean the soap? I mean some crazy people might be.

18:57.074 --> 18:59.074
I know some people, who even wash

18:59.574 --> 19:01.574
the tap and also the water.

19:04.548 --> 19:07.822
And that’s why, that’s why

19:07.875 --> 19:12.311
this water, which is the purifier, water is the purifier,

19:12.852 --> 19:14.852
water purifies us physically.

19:16.204 --> 19:20.484
And also our poisons are driven out of our liver

19:20.578 --> 19:23.772
also by water. Water is a very great element

19:23.826 --> 19:25.826
element in removing all problems.

19:26.042 --> 19:29.157
You use water for so many things; you know how it works it out.

19:29.454 --> 19:36.045
So this Lakshmi, which is purification, was born out of water.

19:36.545 --> 19:39.125
That’s why She was called as Mary as I told you.

19:39.949 --> 19:43.513
And I’m also called as Nira, meaning born out of water.

19:48.272 --> 19:51.586
So one has to understand that today’s message

19:51.721 --> 19:56.616
is that we inculcate purity.

19:58.333 --> 20:04.134
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat, but we should inculcate

20:05.121 --> 20:07.698
purity within ourselves

20:08.414 --> 20:17.906
as a matter of our own maturity, as our own decoration, as our own beauty

20:18.406 --> 20:24.362
and not just because it’s a laborious thing

20:24.603 --> 20:27.261
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

20:29.529 --> 20:33.294
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

20:33.794 --> 20:35.794
How do we like to have a bath

20:36.122 --> 20:39.593
or to be clean and to be presentable?

20:39.834 --> 20:43.488
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

20:44.893 --> 20:47.091
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

20:48.195 --> 20:51.960
Thoughts must be made clean. First of all why have thoughts at all.

20:53.754 --> 20:57.103
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

20:58.552 --> 21:03.641
Even if you have to have, don’t have thoughts full of arrogance,

21:04.141 --> 21:06.141
aggression or of fear.

21:06.469 --> 21:08.691
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

21:08.760 --> 21:10.760
it’s a very good thing; “Oh I'm frightened,

21:10.786 --> 21:14.748
I am afraid.” It’s impurity. Why should you be afraid?

21:16.973 --> 21:18.973
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

21:19.473 --> 21:23.022
There’s no need to have any fear of any kind;

21:23.522 --> 21:25.522
no need to have any fear of any kind.

21:26.108 --> 21:28.815
If you have to have fear

21:29.186 --> 21:30.845
that means there’s something wrong with you.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.373
If you believe that God is above all,

21:34.701 --> 21:37.296
you are a realized soul and that

21:37.796 --> 21:39.796
God is going to look after you,

21:40.296 --> 21:42.296
that He is your father,

21:42.537 --> 21:44.537
that He’s open His gates to you,

21:45.037 --> 21:46.555
what is there to be afraid of?

21:47.055 --> 21:49.903
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

21:50.662 --> 21:53.907
you are humble. Humility is different

21:54.148 --> 21:56.148
from a frightened person.

21:56.519 --> 21:58.519
It’s absolutely a egible thing

21:58.631 --> 22:00.251
it has nothing to do with humility.

22:00.751 --> 22:03.673
So to be humble is different

22:05.423 --> 22:09.281
and to be frightened is different. For Sahaja yogis

22:09.997 --> 22:14.472
it is very easy to find out through their vibratory awareness

22:15.533 --> 22:19.360
what is fear and what is humility.

22:19.774 --> 22:24.468
As humility will give you vibrations and fear will catch all your left side.

22:30.272 --> 22:34.312
So our purification of our mind

22:34.510 --> 22:36.903
comes through certain methods

22:37.187 --> 22:39.187
of understanding ourselves.

22:39.687 --> 22:42.898
First of the understandings one has to have

22:52.990 --> 22:58.841
is that we are born

22:59.341 --> 23:02.591
in a family, born in a society, born in a so-called

23:03.091 --> 23:04.235
religious sect or whatever it is.

23:06.227 --> 23:13.298
So all these fixations have put into us certain amount of impurities.

23:14.295 --> 23:17.349
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

23:18.702 --> 23:23.228
So to keep it pure and simple is:

23:25.220 --> 23:28.149
take to water element as much as you can.

23:29.360 --> 23:34.424
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego. Take to water element.

23:34.924 --> 23:42.470
And that is what Lakshmi is. Lakshmi is the one that gives you

23:42.970 --> 23:44.970
the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

23:45.470 --> 23:49.440
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi’s principle comes in.

23:49.443 --> 23:53.901
And this is after the purification through the Lakshmi process.

23:54.401 --> 23:56.401
Christ has said, “If you want

23:57.327 --> 23:59.327
I can give you gold, gold parts,

24:00.893 --> 24:02.049
you can live with it.

24:03.188 --> 24:07.539
But those who love Me will only enter into the Kingdom of God.

24:08.039 --> 24:10.039
And I will eat with them,”

24:10.113 --> 24:12.262
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

24:12.554 --> 24:14.762
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

24:17.251 --> 24:22.391
He was so, I mean, every, all the incarnations are aware of it,

24:24.312 --> 24:26.151
that they have to be with the pure people

24:26.190 --> 24:29.761
and they have to help the pure people. But He so clearly said it

24:31.360 --> 24:33.360
that if you want Lakshmi,

24:33.506 --> 24:35.791
you can have it, that’s money.

24:37.744 --> 24:41.861
But that’s not Mahalakshmi, so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

24:43.089 --> 24:45.682
You’ve already got your Realization,

24:45.682 --> 24:47.398
you do not know how much you have got it already

24:47.398 --> 24:50.451
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

24:50.451 --> 24:53.654
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle? That’s the point.

24:53.852 --> 24:56.472
Can I ask this question?

25:04.605 --> 25:07.843
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

25:11.516 --> 25:13.740
It’s all for the Spirit.

25:13.740 --> 25:14.240
Hum?

25:14.243 --> 25:16.820
It’s all for the Spirit, Mother.

25:17.056 --> 25:19.056
No, no. But you have a power.

25:21.505 --> 25:25.121
You have got MahaLakshmi’s powers within you, do you know that?

25:26.449 --> 25:28.380
Mother? The pleasure it gives you.

25:28.380 --> 25:28.880
hmm?

25:28.880 --> 25:30.402
The pleasure it gives you.

25:30.402 --> 25:30.902
I beg your pardon?

25:30.902 --> 25:32.330
The pleasure it gives you.

25:32.330 --> 25:32.843
The pleasure?

25:32.843 --> 25:33.343
Yes.

25:33.343 --> 25:34.279
No, no, no.

25:34.279 --> 25:36.279
The power of giving Realization.

25:37.651 --> 25:40.122
Go ahead still, a little more, move.

25:42.112 --> 25:45.530
Pleasure is not a power.

25:45.530 --> 25:49.643
Pleasure is what you enjoy. But it's, you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

25:51.634 --> 25:52.962
Sustaining power?

25:52.962 --> 25:53.485
What's it?

25:53.485 --> 25:56.179
Sustaining power.

25:56.573 --> 26:03.920
That’s no power. Power means, you have that power to do something.

26:07.363 --> 26:08.742
Potential?

26:08.742 --> 26:09.943
The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

26:09.943 --> 26:10.523
Hum?

26:10.523 --> 26:12.523
The power to spread Sahaja yoga, Mother.

26:12.940 --> 26:16.204
That’s rather vague: particular one.

26:16.503 --> 26:18.503
Power to give Realization.

26:18.503 --> 26:21.017
To give Realization, other.

26:22.724 --> 26:23.743
To evolve Mother.

26:25.305 --> 26:26.687
To evolve.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.674
But to evolve is your own.

26:31.093 --> 26:34.010
Power is what you do to others.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.466
The whole thing, I told you just now, is to purify.

26:43.406 --> 26:49.996
You have the power to purify. How do you cure people?

26:50.856 --> 26:56.991
By purifying them. All right?

26:59.842 --> 27:04.776
Now just think how you purify others, by talking to others

27:04.909 --> 27:06.909
you can purify them.

27:09.713 --> 27:15.171
By touching others, you can purify them. By looking at them,

27:15.487 --> 27:16.860
you can purify them.

27:18.283 --> 27:20.668
One person who is a Realized soul,

27:20.668 --> 27:24.488
purifies the whole atmosphere. The atmosphere is purified.

27:24.868 --> 27:27.214
Since I’ve come, it has been warm enough.

27:31.093 --> 27:36.187
You purify everything. You purify this light, do you notice that?

27:38.026 --> 27:40.026
You awaken the light.

27:45.005 --> 27:48.125
Now what other powers you have?

27:54.789 --> 27:55.899
To raise the Kundalini.

27:55.919 --> 27:56.473
Hum?

27:56.473 --> 27:57.434
Raise Kundalini.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.843
That’s awakening.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.406
You see, Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

28:05.691 --> 28:07.575
You purify yourselves,

28:08.810 --> 28:10.810
others and yourselves.

28:10.810 --> 28:14.726
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let’s have it.

28:16.157 --> 28:18.507
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them,

28:18.507 --> 28:20.449
this is the best part of it!

28:22.688 --> 28:25.764
Can’t follow it now. Now let’s have it.

28:25.764 --> 28:28.258
The power to arrange time to suit you, Mother.

28:28.258 --> 28:29.211
What's this?

28:30.560 --> 28:32.560
Power over time.

28:32.767 --> 28:35.267
Arranging time to suit yourself.

28:35.960 --> 28:38.917
But that’s not the power of Mahalakshmi.

28:38.917 --> 28:42.088
That’s another one, I’ll tell you, who does that.

28:46.953 --> 28:49.211
Balance.

28:53.306 --> 28:54.617
What do you say?

28:54.617 --> 28:58.541
It gives a balance between ego and superego.

28:58.541 --> 29:02.252
That’s true. That is one of them. But that is guru power.

29:02.252 --> 29:03.982
That is the guru’s power.

29:04.258 --> 29:06.019
Balance comes from guru.

29:08.943 --> 29:12.284
You see, Mahalakshmi is water. So, now you tell Me.

29:13.807 --> 29:14.593
To cleanse.

29:15.032 --> 29:18.683
That’s all done now, one cleansing is done. What else water does?

29:20.191 --> 29:21.654
It quenches the thirst.

29:21.654 --> 29:22.154
Ha?

29:22.154 --> 29:23.092
Quenches.

29:23.834 --> 29:24.917
Satisfy.

29:24.917 --> 29:25.845
Satisfaction.

29:25.845 --> 29:28.354
Now coming to the heart.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.249
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

29:33.664 --> 29:37.747
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power it is,

29:37.747 --> 29:39.747
because even you doing Realization,

29:39.747 --> 29:44.101
done! The seeking is over. All right?

29:44.887 --> 29:48.132
Then another one. Now come along.

29:48.132 --> 29:49.791
What other power?

29:52.672 --> 29:54.319
Think of the water.

29:58.724 --> 30:03.540
Nourishment, you nourish.

30:04.196 --> 30:07.917
You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power;

30:08.023 --> 30:11.666
even if you are standing there you are nourishing others.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.591
Then it's a solvent.

30:18.533 --> 30:21.209
You dissolve their ego, you dissolve their superego.

30:22.452 --> 30:25.798
All these powers you own now, after Realization.

30:28.413 --> 30:32.843
Just think of it. What else?

30:32.963 --> 30:33.926
Divinity.

30:37.396 --> 30:39.396
That’s very vague,

30:39.396 --> 30:44.357
because divinity is how to relate it with water, people won’t understand.

30:44.357 --> 30:46.841
So, let us put it the other way round.

30:46.841 --> 30:49.261
What is it?

30:49.261 --> 30:50.711
To cool down emotions.

30:50.711 --> 30:51.443
What?

30:51.443 --> 30:53.939
To cool down emotions and conscience.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.604
You become a cool down person.

30:59.410 --> 31:00.781
Very good!

31:04.623 --> 31:09.784
Very good. You become cool,

31:11.175 --> 31:13.702
a cool personality. You have a cooling effect, very good.

31:13.702 --> 31:14.819
What else?

31:14.819 --> 31:16.075
You can carry others.

31:16.075 --> 31:16.575
Hum?

31:16.575 --> 31:18.575
You can carry others.

31:18.934 --> 31:21.807
With you, you can, very gently

31:22.011 --> 31:23.637
and also drown some of them.

31:29.309 --> 31:33.409
Drown into the love, into the ocean of love.

31:33.409 --> 31:34.393
All right?

31:34.893 --> 31:39.336
But you can also push them with two running jumps, all right?

31:40.171 --> 31:43.335
That also can be done.

31:44.482 --> 31:48.718
It has another very great quality that water permeates

31:49.482 --> 31:53.897
into the smallest particle. It goes to the roots and it suck through the roots.

31:56.019 --> 31:59.471
So, Mahalakshmi power, you just see the roots of a person.

31:59.611 --> 32:01.412
You just know where the problem comes from,

32:02.278 --> 32:03.280
you jump to it.

32:03.293 --> 32:07.625
Actually, it is the awareness, it is the intelligence which

32:07.625 --> 32:12.359
sucks the truth part of it, which gets enlightened.

32:12.594 --> 32:19.238
And you understand that now where is the problem, and you just go near the root

32:19.453 --> 32:24.251
when you suck through it, you can be easily sucked through, you permeate.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.964
You see, when you are sitting near a person

32:27.609 --> 32:31.920
and you tell Me, “Mother, this is catching at the back,

32:32.225 --> 32:33.578
the person doesn’t know.”

32:33.578 --> 32:35.578
You have permeated. Your personality has

32:35.578 --> 32:37.578
permeated into that person. He doesn’t know.

32:38.505 --> 32:41.664
You have permeated into that person and you are feeling the roots, you see

32:42.164 --> 32:44.164
where is the problem.

32:44.164 --> 32:45.410
The water is flowing into that being.

32:45.410 --> 32:48.468
The divine water is flowing into that being

32:48.553 --> 32:50.542
and you, the obstruction is felt

32:50.542 --> 32:52.990
through that divine water.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.497
And you can say that, "This is catching, that is catching."

32:59.823 --> 33:01.823
So, the permeating.

33:01.823 --> 33:04.539
And the another one is the glistening of the water.

33:04.904 --> 33:10.556
So, your skin starts glistening, your skin becomes very radiant.

33:13.186 --> 33:16.260
And the last of all is the reflection.

33:17.540 --> 33:19.540
A person, who sees you,

33:20.659 --> 33:24.033
sees his own reflection. He gets frightened.

33:26.028 --> 33:28.028
With Me, it this happens sometimes.

33:28.487 --> 33:30.595
And I don’t mean anything bad to anyone,

33:31.155 --> 33:34.722
but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

33:34.722 --> 33:36.049
because they see their reflection.

33:37.198 --> 33:40.013
So, when they meet you, they see their reflection can be very aggressive,

33:40.013 --> 33:43.898
because they see their reflection. They can be very hard on you

33:43.898 --> 33:45.898
because they see their reflection.

33:51.897 --> 33:58.296
And if it is clear-cut water, then you see the depth of the person.

34:00.407 --> 34:02.407
If you are clear-cut Sahaja Yogi

34:02.744 --> 34:10.285
they feel the depth, clean, and they can see through  the Spirit shining.

34:13.214 --> 34:18.229
These are the qualities of water within us.

34:20.462 --> 34:24.694
The more of that, I would say, especially in my body,

34:26.022 --> 34:28.022
the water, I actually buffer

34:28.379 --> 34:30.379
to protect the chakras.

34:30.379 --> 34:32.379
If I don’t have water in the body,

34:32.379 --> 34:34.848
then I may have problems.

34:34.848 --> 34:36.848
So, it acts as a buffer.

34:37.758 --> 34:43.120
Also, it soothes your epidermal cells, you can say.

34:43.120 --> 34:46.877
it soothes your linings, you see?

34:46.877 --> 34:50.651
If there is no moisture, it will all give dryness and all that.

34:51.418 --> 34:53.418
It soothes everyone.

34:56.483 --> 35:04.204
And there are other types of powers of water, which we know of that when

35:04.204 --> 35:05.878
it comes out of your eyes

35:07.044 --> 35:09.492
it expresses your compassion,

35:11.038 --> 35:13.038
your love, your emotions.

35:14.104 --> 35:16.104
That is the only thing,

35:17.366 --> 35:20.863
out of all the elements, which expresses emotions,

35:24.424 --> 35:27.037
water power, I mean.

35:28.924 --> 35:34.497
Water has other qualities also which physics people know as hydrostatics,

35:34.497 --> 35:35.534
it has the pressure.

35:36.222 --> 35:37.772
It has a pressure

35:38.897 --> 35:40.897
and a person who exists

35:41.357 --> 35:42.668
like a Sahaja Yogi,

35:42.843 --> 35:46.895
will definitely put a pressure on others. He will not,

35:47.027 --> 35:50.726
he will not aggress but there will be a pressure and pressure.

35:50.950 --> 35:57.003
And another person, if he receives it, then he gets the advantage of it.

35:57.003 --> 35:59.180
But if he does not receive it,

35:59.180 --> 36:03.599
then he feel pressurized and he feels a little bit dominated.

36:04.975 --> 36:07.138
Your neigbhors, your family people,

36:07.353 --> 36:09.751
at the beginning will feel, "Oh, there's a pressure"

36:09.870 --> 36:13.770
because the body achieves a kind of a weight.

36:15.422 --> 36:18.666
And that’s how the Guru tattva is formed out of water.

36:20.896 --> 36:22.896
And if there is salt,

36:24.004 --> 36:27.207
that's Guru principle, then the weight is even more.

36:29.690 --> 36:34.926
So, today for water, you should really know that

36:35.594 --> 36:38.885
water is a very holy thing.

36:39.283 --> 36:42.107
And in our pujas also, we use -

36:42.621 --> 36:47.098
especially this thing signifies the Kundalini,

36:47.098 --> 36:51.653
that means the Kundalini is the water jar,

36:51.653 --> 36:54.819
or the carrier of Aquarius.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.880
And this is the Age of the Aquarius.

36:58.104 --> 37:01.263
So, how important is water!

37:01.263 --> 37:10.215
And the water is the carrier of divine love, is the best carrier.

37:10.215 --> 37:18.102
And this is the time of Aquarius means the Kundalini is made of divine water.

37:20.413 --> 37:25.448
So, the whole idea of celebrating,

37:25.978 --> 37:32.724
today is the Lakshmi’s day, is to understand that in us

37:32.724 --> 37:35.481
She has become a Mahalakshmi.

37:35.481 --> 37:41.530
And by that, we have so many powers of which we are not aware,
I mean we do not know also that we are Realized souls,

37:41.530 --> 37:42.843
some of us do not know,

37:42.843 --> 37:46.605
and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others.

37:46.605 --> 37:49.308
We can project our personalities onto others.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.940
We can find out what’s wrong with them.

37:53.088 --> 37:58.264
We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves,
we can go into - our permeation  is like water

37:58.264 --> 38:02.668
it's going, it's flowing all the time. And this

38:03.886 --> 38:07.399
is a very important thing that we should be aware

38:07.399 --> 38:09.107
of our powers that we have achieved.

38:09.107 --> 38:12.781
Then we start respecting ourselves then the Rajalakshmi comes in

38:13.044 --> 38:14.740
and then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

38:15.037 --> 38:18.683
and everything comes with it when we become aware

38:19.061 --> 38:24.198
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem,

38:25.829 --> 38:27.829
of our dignity.

38:28.553 --> 38:32.427
So, this gives us dignity, Mahalakshmi gives us dignity.

38:33.039 --> 38:36.626
And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity.

38:38.070 --> 38:41.813
We should have also the idea of human dignity

38:42.313 --> 38:45.075
that we cannot insult human dignity,

38:49.439 --> 38:52.897
like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against

38:54.262 --> 38:56.475
or all the time asserting themselves about

38:56.456 --> 38:59.103
something making everybody’s life miserable.

38:59.315 --> 39:03.311
It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another's life,

39:03.465 --> 39:08.572
you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable

39:08.784 --> 39:12.629
and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time.

39:13.129 --> 39:15.304
And if you nag that’s not a Gruhalakshmi;

39:15.516 --> 39:18.319
that is not a Gruhalakshmi. You should not nag, “Do this, do that,

39:18.473 --> 39:21.424
stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.”

39:21.693 --> 39:24.087
It’s all a nonsense. You /?/ the person to do it;

39:24.472 --> 39:26.310
the human dignity is the most important thing.

39:26.810 --> 39:28.810
Must respect the human dignity.

39:29.310 --> 39:32.208
And that’s possible because now you have got the Mahalakshmi power.

39:32.708 --> 39:35.831
Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you

39:36.043 --> 39:37.627
because you are dignified now.

39:38.761 --> 39:41.351
If you have sense of dignity, you will never insult other’s dignity.

39:41.851 --> 39:43.851
For small, small things we insult others

39:43.890 --> 39:47.305
“Why did you put the soap here, why did you do this, why did you do that?”

39:48.728 --> 39:50.475
And the another side coud be that others

39:50.629 --> 39:53.990
have no dignity so they go on doing things just like animals.

39:54.490 --> 39:56.490
The both things are wrong.

39:57.336 --> 40:02.577
But one must respect and respect brings the best results I have seen.

40:03.077 --> 40:06.525
That’s the best result, once you respect and love

40:08.813 --> 40:10.813
and then the trust is grown

40:10.852 --> 40:12.494
and one should keep the trust.

40:12.648 --> 40:15.636
And that’s how the human dignity /?/

40:16.136 --> 40:18.136
We must respect every Sahaja yogi

40:18.982 --> 40:22.697
because we are all saints, to respect each other,

40:23.197 --> 40:25.197
absolutely respect because you are all saints.

40:25.351 --> 40:27.351
I don’t know you realize what I am saying.

40:28.774 --> 40:33.038
Each one of you is capable of giving realization to the whole world,

40:33.538 --> 40:34.624
each one of you

40:37.604 --> 40:41.700
and if we realize then we must respect ourselves and respect others.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.912
You should do not talk frivolously about others, make fun.

40:46.392 --> 40:48.392
And specially your Mother,

40:48.719 --> 40:50.719
you can’t take liberties with Her.

40:51.969 --> 40:53.969
That is something one has to know

40:54.469 --> 40:58.627
in the west is important. This is very important

40:59.300 --> 41:01.300
that one has to know about it.

41:02.550 --> 41:04.550
The other day I was correcting somebody.

41:05.050 --> 41:07.050
So Hugh said that “You are a very lucky person

41:07.146 --> 41:09.009
that Mother is correcting you; you are very lucky

41:09.163 --> 41:11.163
that She is correcting you, telling you something,

41:11.432 --> 41:15.890
because you are naive you see, that is why you start taking liberties.”

41:16.621 --> 41:20.241
First of all you must respect the divinity of your Mother.

41:20.510 --> 41:24.922
That’s very important. And that gives you the greatest dignity.

41:26.114 --> 41:31.272
I am telling you this because unless and until you do that, your growth

41:31.772 --> 41:33.772
cannot come up well.

41:33.811 --> 41:35.811
So that is a very important point

41:36.311 --> 41:40.639
and like in India supposing somebody is going to a temple

41:40.735 --> 41:43.506
or they come to - for example, today

41:43.833 --> 41:46.318
She has come or somebody has come they will better,

41:46.414 --> 41:47.772
they will wear a nice dress.

41:48.560 --> 41:51.407
You see, you are going to a temple and all the ornaments they will wear,

41:51.561 --> 41:52.978
everything they will wear.

41:53.132 --> 41:55.485
That is the day they have to present all their dignity.

41:55.985 --> 41:58.159
So one should not come with

41:58.371 --> 42:01.395
dishevel hair or things like that.

42:03.337 --> 42:07.051
That is not a good thing because all these things are important,

42:07.263 --> 42:09.263
how you respect.

42:09.763 --> 42:14.248
How you have to be dressed

42:14.517 --> 42:16.745
how you have to presentable, because these things

42:16.841 --> 42:19.084
Some people say that oh /?/

42:19.584 --> 42:21.584
we don’t need to be tidy because we are the spirit

42:22.084 --> 42:24.084
Spirit is the most tidy thing.

42:24.296 --> 42:26.657
It tidies everything you see.

42:26.754 --> 42:29.812
It tidies everything. It goes into proper synthesis, proper

42:30.081 --> 42:31.727
concord, a complete,

42:32.458 --> 42:34.641
beautiful music is created out of that.

42:35.141 --> 42:38.641
How can a chaotic person be called spiritual man? Cannot,

42:38.680 --> 42:41.575
anybody who is chaotic, their house is chaotic, their things are chaotic,

42:41.671 --> 42:43.974
you must know there is something bhootish in them,

42:43.998 --> 42:45.998
absolutely.

42:47.363 --> 42:49.363
But you should not be other way round, that

42:49.575 --> 42:52.102
so meticulous that you eat others’ heads.

42:52.615 --> 42:55.783
That’s another side. So both things should not be done.

42:56.108 --> 42:59.288
And I go on insisting on this point because it is very important

42:59.788 --> 43:01.305
for ego-oriented people

43:01.805 --> 43:03.805
because they can become anything.

43:04.478 --> 43:07.529
The other day I was going on King’s Road and I was surprised

43:08.087 --> 43:10.087
what sort of dresses people are wearing

43:10.126 --> 43:12.246
and they think that “whatever we wear, we are.”

43:12.342 --> 43:14.038
That means you must be monkeys,

43:14.538 --> 43:16.538
you wear such dresses and go about it.

43:17.038 --> 43:19.506
If you believe in that then you should be decent people,

43:19.718 --> 43:21.068
there should be decorum about it.

43:26.700 --> 43:33.380
So today we have learnt about Lakshmi's growth into Mahalakshmi

43:33.995 --> 43:37.476
but it is not that when you grow into something the rest of it is finished,

43:37.572 --> 43:41.362
is not so, that some people think that they become

43:41.399 --> 43:45.106
spiritual personality now Lakshmi Tattwa is not there, is not true.

43:45.952 --> 43:47.952
You have to be decent person,

43:48.452 --> 43:53.109
properly dressed according to your status in life, the way you live.

43:53.609 --> 43:57.960
And there should be no, what you call, hypocrisy about it,

43:58.460 --> 44:01.609
no hypocrisy. By doing any

44:01.763 --> 44:03.763
nonsensical thing,

44:03.802 --> 44:06.630
like some people think becoming a primitive or anything,

44:06.842 --> 44:09.018
you will impress others. You will never impress,

44:09.230 --> 44:11.230
you see. It’s beggar’s thing,

44:11.499 --> 44:15.259
see, doing beggary you will get some beggars bhoot into you.

44:16.336 --> 44:19.154
So we are not to be beggars, neither we have to be

44:19.654 --> 44:23.198
a sort of dandies, but we are Sahaja yogis, dignified people.

44:23.698 --> 44:27.436
We have our own self-esteem and we live with our own dignity,

44:27.705 --> 44:31.948
and that’s how we should be pure

44:32.967 --> 44:34.967
transparent, honest,

44:36.044 --> 44:37.659
within ourselves we should be honest,

44:37.813 --> 44:40.852
absolutely honest. Water is so honest with itself.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.640
We put anything to the water it will show.

44:44.890 --> 44:46.890
Put any color into it, it will show.

44:47.390 --> 44:49.390
Put any mud it will show.

44:49.486 --> 44:52.196
You have to be so honest, honest to yourself.

44:53.215 --> 44:56.296
And the whole thing should work out to be a personality

44:56.796 --> 45:01.550
and be congenial, beautiful, permeating, no doubt

45:01.877 --> 45:03.757
but very beautifully enlightened

45:04.257 --> 45:06.257
because Mahalakshmi Tattwa itself

45:06.296 --> 45:08.296
is enlightenment in our awareness.

45:08.796 --> 45:11.261
Such a person cannot be an idiot. If there is an idiot

45:11.357 --> 45:13.357
he is not a Sahaja yogi, definitely he is not.

45:14.261 --> 45:17.300
Idiotic person cannot be a Sahaja yogi - nitwits,

45:19.472 --> 45:22.943
absent-minded, all that has to go away.

45:23.443 --> 45:25.443
If you all have to be sahaja yogis, you cannot be,

45:25.770 --> 45:28.883
“Oh, I know, I know, I know.” All that nonsense is not be there,

45:29.383 --> 45:30.266
should not be there.

45:31.883 --> 45:39.389
The lakshanas or what do you call, the seed tops, or you can say,

45:40.523 --> 45:44.223
what do you call lakshanas,

45:44.723 --> 45:48.354
is the way you can make out a Sahaja yogi, should be

45:48.854 --> 45:53.566
a Lakshmi putra is the sign of Lakshmi like a king /?/

45:54.585 --> 45:57.385
That doesn’t mean that he has everything to him self, no.

45:58.116 --> 46:00.116
That doesn’t mean that, king gives.

46:00.328 --> 46:02.522
He gives with generosity, known by his generosity.

46:02.791 --> 46:05.634
He is not known by how much he grabs, does he?

46:06.134 --> 46:09.368
He is a king, as it is, is giving.

46:12.292 --> 46:14.522
Then he should be cool personality.

46:16.406 --> 46:19.294
He should not be frozen. He should be cool personality,

46:20.428 --> 46:23.280
not hot- tempered. Those who are hot-tempered,

46:23.780 --> 46:26.513
I have seen people, you see, here

46:27.013 --> 46:29.359
they first take to violence. I mean violence is

46:29.398 --> 46:31.574
something out of question for Sahaja yogis,

46:32.820 --> 46:36.789
no question. If somebody beat you also you are not to beat him back.

46:37.520 --> 46:39.520
We have ways to beat them

46:40.885 --> 46:42.885
but you are not to beat them back.

46:43.904 --> 46:45.904
You are not to resist them,

46:46.116 --> 46:50.068
but if you are a sahaja yogi you have no business to be violent to anyone,

46:50.568 --> 46:53.051
even with your tongue. Some people are

46:53.147 --> 46:55.147
more with the tongue provocating type.

46:55.647 --> 46:58.559
You must know that you must correct all these points.

46:59.059 --> 47:03.041
It is important because tomorrow if you are going to show to the world

47:03.541 --> 47:05.541
what Sahaja Yoga is not /?/

47:10.828 --> 47:12.828
So we have to dedicate ourselves

47:13.040 --> 47:14.573
to our purification,

47:14.958 --> 47:17.605
to our glorification because water glorifies,

47:18.105 --> 47:20.105
gives you glory.

47:20.201 --> 47:23.524
You are all looking so nice and glistening on the face and I can see

47:23.562 --> 47:25.444
the Ganti Rupena Samasthita.

47:25.598 --> 47:29.939
He said that “Ya Devi Sarva Butheshu Ganti Rupena,” the glistening,

47:29.978 --> 47:34.692
the light and that’s there I can see you in you all.

47:34.904 --> 47:40.271
It has already come but it should be inside also.

47:41.636 --> 47:44.679
And that person who is a realized soul

47:44.833 --> 47:47.234
one doesn’t have to vow for it.

47:48.022 --> 47:50.022
people just know that he is realized soul.

47:51.041 --> 47:55.023
You don’t have to tell anyone people just know the way he is.

47:57.657 --> 47:59.657
So many points we have covered today.

47:59.984 --> 48:01.984
I hope you will

48:02.023 --> 48:03.497
again listen to them because,

48:03.593 --> 48:06.987
see, Mataji’s lecture goes from one ear and comes out from the other.

48:07.890 --> 48:11.740
Thank God we have a way of localizing it.

48:12.009 --> 48:14.009
I hope you people will take these tapes

48:14.105 --> 48:17.371
and listen to them everyday one by one

48:17.583 --> 48:20.659
and also act, not planning

48:20.871 --> 48:24.865
in the paper or in the ear. But it should go in the heart.

48:27.268 --> 48:29.268
That’s how we are all going to mature

48:29.480 --> 48:32.796
beautiful children. I’m just counting

48:33.296 --> 48:39.149
now again C.P. will be elected for four years and then I have to

48:39.649 --> 48:44.994
there is hardly three years it will pass away and

48:46.071 --> 48:48.372
I won’t be able to go so much in U.K.

48:48.872 --> 48:51.509
The responsibility, such a lot on you people.

48:53.970 --> 48:56.637
I hope we celebrate some more Diwalis together.

48:57.465 --> 48:59.465
May God bless you!
