00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.805
and the three processes

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:13.182
through which we pass.

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.859
First is the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:24.340
Actually, this is celebrated mostly on the thirteenth day

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:28.465
of the moon, where they say that

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.379
the housewife has to be given some present.

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:38.848
And the best thing she can have is a some sort of an utensil.

00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:44.305
So people give her some utensils, actually

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
it’s a very mutual thing, because

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:50.622
if you give an utensil, she is supposed to cook for you.

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:59.520
It’s a very sweet way of suggesting that you cook something for us.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.426
Then the fourteenth day is very important,

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:15.614
because that is the day the Goddess as a power,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:22.763
as a power, because it was Kartikeya who killed Narakasura, the devil.

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:30.485
And he was one of the worst of all, could not be killed.

00:01:32.538 --> 00:01:36.667
So Shiva and Parvati were married

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.968
for this special purpose to produce this powerful Shaktiputra,

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.120
means the son of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:51.567
And He was just born to kill this horrible devil,

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:54.503
called as Narakasura.

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.468
And He killed. That is the day, fourteenth day.

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:03.670
It is something like Halloween, that day.

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:05.695
Because that is the day they opened

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:12.820
the gates of hell and put all the devils into hell.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.140
And that’s why that day one has to rest in the morning time as long as possible.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.990
So that let all the devils be put in nicely

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.357
because some of them might be hanging around still.

00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:31.207
It’s better to allow them to get out.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.230
I mean in the realm that you are

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.943
you do not feel much their existence.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.064
But if you were in the realm of subconscious area or collective subconscious,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.206
people see even some of the spirits

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:47.281
and also can feel their existence,

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.221
they see the black spots and all that.

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:55.359
So that day is very dangerous,

00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:59.088
but because Narakasura was killed,

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:03.126
people celebrated.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:08.301
That celebration is expressed next day,

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:12.988
which that day is the day of Diwali they say.

00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:16.951
That is the day they also worship Lakshmi, because

00:03:17.826 --> 00:03:20.300
they think that

00:03:20.463 --> 00:03:22.512
that’s the day Lakshmi was born on this earth

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:27.913
from the sea as I told you last time.

00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:33.530
Then the day of the New Year comes in afterwards,

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:38.439
because in India in the north,

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.842
that’s the time people finish their crops

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.523
and they found that day was very good to celebrate the New Year.

00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:49.309
And,

00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:58.238
that is actually more, sort of, we can say is a social thing in India,

00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:00.784
we need not use that,

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:05.998
what ever suits us. You can have your own New Year. Because in the south,

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:11.023
say in Maharastra they have another New Year, as I told you where

00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:15.842
Shalivahana in his dynasty started another

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.566
calendar and they celebrate that.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.932
So all these things are nothing is rigid

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.297
about anything, one must know. Nothing is rigid.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.896
Rigidity comes from ignorance.

00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:32.715
It’s all for you, for your joy and happiness.

00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:35.501
The whole festival system is for your happiness

00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:39.308
and not for the happiness of the time or date.

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:43.633
It’s for you, so it should be adjustable according to your

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:47.708
needs and understanding.

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:51.979
And also according to your

00:04:53.163 --> 00:04:55.203
national way you live.

00:04:55.396 --> 00:04:59.343
They should be no addiction to any

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.192
particular type of culture, a particular type of ideas.

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:07.905
It’s all for you. All these festivals are for you, not for gods.

00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:09.828
They don’t have these festivals.

00:05:10.236 --> 00:05:13.143
It’s only for you people these festivals are there.

00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:17.286
And when you celebrate them, that’s only for your joy and your happiness.

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.103
And that’s how you should celebrate in a way

00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:24.082
that gives you the greatest amount of happiness.

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:28.589
And the festivals, all the festivals of the world must be celebrated.

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.461
The more you are festive, the happier it is.

00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:34.852
Why miss the chance, you see.

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:40.883
So as Sahaja Yogis you can celebrate, you can’t put yourselves in yawn.

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:57.543
So as a Sahaja Yogi you don’t belong to any particular

00:05:57.653 --> 00:06:01.020
caste or community anymore now, you belong to universal caste.

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:04.595
Once you start belonging to the universal thing,

00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:07.846
then you can celebrate all the festivals of all the religions.

00:06:08.046 --> 00:06:09.797
And have the best of it.

00:06:11.717 --> 00:06:15.247
All the year out, you can celebrate all the festivals. Know about them,

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.609
the more you know, the better it is.

00:06:18.242 --> 00:06:20.334
And have all kinds of sweets,

00:06:20.544 --> 00:06:23.923
whatever you use, whatever type you use, in whatever

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.625
areas and countries and cultures. And that’s how

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:33.580
we have to be more festive.

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:38.180
Now the last day is very important,

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:41.175
is a very universal day I should say, called as

00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:44.788
Bhaiya Duja, this day,

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:47.536
or they call it also in Marathi Vao Dijum,

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:51.396
different names. The brothers and sisters day.

00:06:55.713 --> 00:07:01.517
Now the brothers’ and sisters’ relationship

00:07:02.273 --> 00:07:07.523
has to be very, very strong. And the purity of that relationship

00:07:08.057 --> 00:07:09.459
is to be maintained.

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.110
It is not necessary that you should be born as brothers and sisters,

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.553
not necessary.

00:07:16.314 --> 00:07:19.463
But you are born, because if you are

00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:22.510
realized souls you are born as brothers and sisters.

00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:26.989
So that purity must be maintained in the society of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:33.386
Very important, that we should try to develop this

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:39.166
situation that brothers and sisters

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.452
are something very pure. Their relationships are very pure.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.986
And they should not be at all challenged.

00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:53.915
It is so much so that even if you call somebody your brother,

00:07:54.463 --> 00:07:59.202
he is your brother and the more you develop this relationship,

00:07:59.554 --> 00:08:04.434
the better your left Vishuddhi will be. Because left Vishuddhi

00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:08.623
is the relationship with God as a brother

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.427
or with a Goddess as a sister.

00:08:12.678 --> 00:08:17.745
So, Shri Krishna’s sister, as you know was

00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:21.443
born to Nand

00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:25.138
and Shri Krishna himself was born in a prison.

00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:29.083
So there was an exchange that took place.

00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:34.921
They had to replace Her in His place.

00:08:37.593 --> 00:08:40.881
And then when Kamsa,

00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:46.965
the uncle of Krishna, tried to kill that girl,

00:08:47.224 --> 00:08:49.224
She went into the sky

00:08:49.868 --> 00:08:54.321
and like a lightning She said that “Your killer is still living in Gokul,

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:58.925
is still there.” So this lightning that we see,

00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:02.665
is representative of that power,

00:09:02.993 --> 00:09:07.903
which we call as Vishnumaya, is the sister’s. If your sisterly feelings

00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:11.643
towards women are good and strong,

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:17.212
your left Vishuddhi will be very good.

00:09:17.616 --> 00:09:19.616
It has many other qualities.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.863
For example a person, who has a very good left Vishuddi,

00:09:23.616 --> 00:09:25.616
is a very confident person.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.192
Not only that, but whatever he says comes out true.

00:09:33.335 --> 00:09:35.866
Even by mistake, he says something, it comes true.

00:09:37.568 --> 00:09:40.881
It’s a very powerful center left Vishuddhi is.

00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:51.459
Such a person, whenever he speaks to, say, criticize something

00:09:52.202 --> 00:09:55.722
or to cut down something or to be against something,

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:59.271
then it has the power to crash

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:06.170
all that he doesn’t want. See like, you can say

00:10:07.554 --> 00:10:10.726
Christ, His left Vishuddhi

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.872
is expressed through His relationship with Mary Magdalene.

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:20.183
When He stood up and said that

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:26.482
“Those who have not committed any sin can stone her,” so this is His power.

00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:33.411
The sin of the people just crashed them completely;

00:10:33.478 --> 00:10:36.967
they were finished, because the sin was there. And the sin was

00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:42.486
of left Vishuddhi. There was no purity. And when there is no purity,

00:10:42.704 --> 00:10:45.525
the person who is so pure says such a thing,

00:10:45.943 --> 00:10:50.036
all these people lost their powers; they couldn’t even stone.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:57.226
Now this sister of His was born later on as Draupadi

00:10:57.873 --> 00:11:01.230
and that to very near the place we have been to, Vani,

00:11:01.338 --> 00:11:06.152
you know, where we saw. Gavin do you remember when we were going to Nagpur?

00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:14.157
Near Vani she was born, that place and there’s a very big temple of that.

00:11:14.997 --> 00:11:20.141
She was called as Draupadi and you know how Shri Krishna tried to save

00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:22.219
Her chastity.

00:11:23.336 --> 00:11:26.961
Now people,

00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:33.400
I have heard, are trying also to say things against Mary Magdalene

00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:38.074
and against Christ and all kinds of things, you see. This is the sign of

00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:42.144
the decadence of our brains and of our morality

00:11:42.265 --> 00:11:45.830
that we cannot see purity in any relationship.

00:11:47.309 --> 00:11:50.593
We cannot see any purity in any relationship.

00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:54.502
So we as sahaja yogis have to develop

00:11:55.002 --> 00:11:59.140
more of that. Instead of that what I find that people,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.355
specially in the West, try to think whom we are going to marry whom.

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.095
These relationships are established, is wrong.

00:12:09.272 --> 00:12:12.715
There is no need to go on organizing marriages

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:16.071
and playing these games of romance and all that.

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:19.077
If marriage has to take place, it will take place.

00:12:19.577 --> 00:12:21.760
But don’t spoil the atmosphere.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.225
There are some people who are just like

00:12:25.226 --> 00:12:28.590
barbers, who try to organize marriages

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:32.166
you see and take a great pride in arranging marriages

00:12:32.165 --> 00:12:34.499
with this one to that one and that one to that one.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.616
Is not a desirable thing; one should not do it. There’s no

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:44.141
virtue in these things, is to organize marriages all the time.

00:12:45.005 --> 00:12:47.005
When the marriage time comes,

00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:47.955
it takes place.

00:12:48.683 --> 00:12:50.683
Now at the time of Mohammed Sahib

00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:57.908
a big question arose, because there were very few man

00:12:58.049 --> 00:13:00.741
many ladies of all age groups.

00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.429
And they didn’t know what to do, how to save these girls

00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:06.391
because so many men died in the war.

00:13:07.665 --> 00:13:12.510
So then they asked, “What to do now at this juncture in a position, when such

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:15.962
a catastrophe is there and so many women are

00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:19.389
there, and very, very few men?” Then He said, “All right, you can marry

00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:23.379
four or five wives and you can marry in any age group.”

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.469
Because if you have to

00:13:25.969 --> 00:13:30.066
live with dharma, means marriage, means collective sanction,

00:13:30.566 --> 00:13:32.566
not without marriage.

00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:34.747
So He said, “All right, you can even marry five times,

00:13:35.202 --> 00:13:37.577
but you must marry, without marriage you cannot live.”

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.080
And that is why He was particular

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.546
that every person should be married and should have no relationship

00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:47.978
without marriage, was sin.

00:13:49.546 --> 00:13:51.563
Instead of that now Muslims think that it

00:13:51.608 --> 00:13:52.866
is there right to marry five persons.

00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:55.279
I mean, when the men are more and women are less.

00:13:57.918 --> 00:14:01.056
Is a wrong thing. You have to find out the solution.

00:14:01.419 --> 00:14:05.918
And at that time the relationship between

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:10.149
even the sisters and brothers had to delimit,

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:11.997
because there was a big problem.

00:14:12.648 --> 00:14:17.644
So He said, “All right, the children born of the same parents cannot marry,

00:14:18.144 --> 00:14:20.927
but cousins could marry,” that time.

00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:25.034
Now that time is changed, all right,

00:14:25.534 --> 00:14:27.629
it’s not that time. We are not on war,

00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:31.488
there is nothing happening like that. There is no such problem.

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:33.988
So let us develop now our

00:14:34.943 --> 00:14:37.920
pure relationship of brothers and sisters.

00:14:38.056 --> 00:14:40.768
Actually, first time when we had this

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:43.716
this Diwali function, I asked people

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.216
to find one sister for yourself.

00:14:46.944 --> 00:14:48.944
Every gentleman must have one sister,

00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:57.643
to find out one. And then that is the day, I said, let us start this way

00:14:57.824 --> 00:15:03.651
that next time when we meet on another day called as

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.380
Rakhi Purnima,

00:15:07.561 --> 00:15:11.158
that you tie the rakhi in the hand, the same brothers and sisters.

00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:14.891
In India also we did like that and it worked very well.

00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:19.366
But there the relationships are so strong. Once Dhumal, you see,

00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:22.959
I think tied it to Raulbai.

00:15:23.277 --> 00:15:26.040
And now even if I say something to Raulbai, he doesn’t like.

00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:29.928
It exceeded to that extent. It’s so sweet you know.

00:15:30.428 --> 00:15:34.839
And even Dhumal’s wife respects Raulbai as an elder sister, you see.

00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:39.011
It’s very sweet. Like that many relationships are established.

00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:41.179
And next year I think Raulbai

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.614
became the sister of one of our trustees, who was no more there.

00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:48.352
And she always carried on all that

00:15:48.397 --> 00:15:51.593
relationship, and they also, I mean imagine.

00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:56.506
The whole thing is that, that relationship is so special,

00:15:57.006 --> 00:15:59.006
so close and so pure.

00:16:02.237 --> 00:16:04.237
And such a relationship one should develop

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.671
with a lady, any woman

00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:11.360
or any friend you want to have.

00:16:12.998 --> 00:16:14.799
One should remember that it cannot

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.477
cross a certain limit, there has to have a maryada.

00:16:17.522 --> 00:16:19.331
Otherwise they will become brothers and sisters

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.964
and then they marry, it’s not possible.

00:16:22.784 --> 00:16:25.654
So we have to have the boundaries; that is very important.

00:16:26.154 --> 00:16:28.383
In Sahaja Yoga we have to have maryadas

00:16:28.382 --> 00:16:32.453
and boundaries. And one of them is this: that once you call somebody

00:16:32.484 --> 00:16:36.339
brother or a sister, is absolutely pure relationship.

00:16:37.612 --> 00:16:39.424
Little further we’ll go with that

00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:43.425
and that the relationship with a, as I have told you before,

00:16:43.925 --> 00:16:50.224
that with your, say, husband’s younger brothers

00:16:50.724 --> 00:16:53.318
is just like that they are like your younger brothers,

00:16:53.454 --> 00:16:55.734
all of them, husband’s younger brothers

00:16:56.234 --> 00:16:58.906
or younger Sahaja yogis than your husbands, are.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.690
The other way round is for all the ladies,

00:17:07.323 --> 00:17:14.638
we can say, all the men, their wives, elder ladies, elder to your wives,

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:17.998
are like sisters, elder sisters.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.612
I mean this relationship is so sweet and

00:17:22.112 --> 00:17:24.560
gives you a certain amount of understanding

00:17:24.654 --> 00:17:27.232
how much distance is kept with whom,

00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:29.811
with whom to be free and with whom to have the distance.

00:17:30.311 --> 00:17:33.043
And this must be maintained with such a beautiful way

00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:36.993
that this purity is not corrupted.

00:17:37.817 --> 00:17:42.153
You keep to pure standards. This is

00:17:42.653 --> 00:17:45.705
the nourishment of Sahaja yoga, is the nourishment

00:17:45.962 --> 00:17:47.962
of your growth, purity.

00:17:48.178 --> 00:17:50.961
Purity is the most important thing for us,

00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:59.397
purity in every way. If you are pure, you will not do anything

00:17:59.853 --> 00:18:08.263
that is, we can say, that is not pure.

00:18:10.264 --> 00:18:12.060
So first of all you’ll be pure yourself

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.290
and you’ll accept purity, you’ll appreciate purity,

00:18:15.628 --> 00:18:19.323
you will be sustained by purity. Any impurity will not collaborate

00:18:19.945 --> 00:18:23.632
or try to compromise with you.

00:18:25.227 --> 00:18:29.544
That’s why purity is your Mother’s name.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.409
You know that My name is purity.

00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:36.881
And this purity is such that it pures everything,

00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:38.856
it just purifies.

00:18:39.032 --> 00:18:41.729
The purity should be such that it should purify,

00:18:43.527 --> 00:18:45.527
otherwise that purity has no meaning.

00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:50.998
For example, a soap purifies, all right. But you don’t purify the soap.

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:55.966
Do you clean the soap? I mean some crazy people might be.

00:18:57.074 --> 00:18:59.074
I know some people, who even wash

00:18:59.574 --> 00:19:01.574
the tap and also the water.

00:19:04.548 --> 00:19:07.822
And that’s why, that’s why

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:12.311
this water, which is the purifier, water is the purifier,

00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:14.852
water purifies us physically.

00:19:16.204 --> 00:19:20.484
And also our poisons are driven out of our liver

00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:23.772
also by water. Water is a very great element

00:19:23.826 --> 00:19:25.826
element in removing all problems.

00:19:26.042 --> 00:19:29.157
You use water for so many things; you know how it works it out.

00:19:29.454 --> 00:19:36.045
So this Lakshmi, which is purification, was born out of water.

00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:39.125
That’s why She was called as Mary as I told you.

00:19:39.949 --> 00:19:43.513
And I’m also called as Nira, meaning born out of water.

00:19:48.272 --> 00:19:51.586
So one has to understand that today’s message

00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:56.616
is that we inculcate purity.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:04.134
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat, but we should inculcate

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:07.698
purity within ourselves

00:20:08.414 --> 00:20:17.906
as a matter of our own maturity, as our own decoration, as our own beauty

00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:24.362
and not just because it’s a laborious thing

00:20:24.603 --> 00:20:27.261
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:33.294
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

00:20:33.794 --> 00:20:35.794
How do we like to have a bath

00:20:36.122 --> 00:20:39.593
or to be clean and to be presentable?

00:20:39.834 --> 00:20:43.488
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:47.091
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

00:20:48.195 --> 00:20:51.960
Thoughts must be made clean. First of all why have thoughts at all.

00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:57.103
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

00:20:58.552 --> 00:21:03.641
Even if you have to have, don’t have thoughts full of arrogance,

00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:06.141
aggression or of fear.

00:21:06.469 --> 00:21:08.691
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.760
it’s a very good thing; “Oh I'm frightened,

00:21:10.786 --> 00:21:14.748
I am afraid.” It’s impurity. Why should you be afraid?

00:21:16.973 --> 00:21:18.973
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

00:21:19.473 --> 00:21:23.022
There’s no need to have any fear of any kind;

00:21:23.522 --> 00:21:25.522
no need to have any fear of any kind.

00:21:26.108 --> 00:21:28.815
If you have to have fear

00:21:29.186 --> 00:21:30.845
that means there’s something wrong with you.

00:21:31.082 --> 00:21:34.373
If you believe that God is above all,

00:21:34.701 --> 00:21:37.296
you are a realized soul and that

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:39.796
God is going to look after you,

00:21:40.296 --> 00:21:42.296
that He is your father,

00:21:42.537 --> 00:21:44.537
that He’s open His gates to you,

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:46.555
what is there to be afraid of?

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:49.903
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

00:21:50.662 --> 00:21:53.907
you are humble. Humility is different

00:21:54.148 --> 00:21:56.148
from a frightened person.

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:58.519
It’s absolutely a egible thing

00:21:58.631 --> 00:22:00.251
it has nothing to do with humility.

00:22:00.751 --> 00:22:03.673
So to be humble is different

00:22:05.423 --> 00:22:09.281
and to be frightened is different. For Sahaja yogis

00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:14.472
it is very easy to find out through their vibratory awareness

00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:19.360
what is fear and what is humility.

00:22:19.774 --> 00:22:24.468
As humility will give you vibrations and fear will catch all your left side.

00:22:30.272 --> 00:22:34.312
So our purification of our mind

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.903
comes through certain methods

00:22:37.187 --> 00:22:39.187
of understanding ourselves.

00:22:39.687 --> 00:22:42.898
First of the understandings one has to have

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:58.841
is that we are born

00:22:59.341 --> 00:23:02.591
in a family, born in a society, born in a so-called

00:23:03.091 --> 00:23:04.235
religious sect or whatever it is.

00:23:06.227 --> 00:23:13.298
So all these fixations have put into us certain amount of impurities.

00:23:14.295 --> 00:23:17.349
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

00:23:18.702 --> 00:23:23.228
So to keep it pure and simple is:

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.149
take to water element as much as you can.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.424
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego. Take to water element.

00:23:34.924 --> 00:23:42.470
And that is what Lakshmi is. Lakshmi is the one that gives you

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.970
the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.440
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi’s principle comes in.

00:23:49.443 --> 00:23:53.901
And this is after the purification through the Lakshmi process.

00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:56.401
Christ has said, “If you want

00:23:57.327 --> 00:23:59.327
I can give you gold, gold parts,

00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:02.049
you can live with it.

00:24:03.188 --> 00:24:07.539
But those who love Me will only enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:10.039
And I will eat with them,”

00:24:10.113 --> 00:24:12.262
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

00:24:12.554 --> 00:24:14.762
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

00:24:17.251 --> 00:24:22.391
He was so, I mean, every, all the incarnations are aware of it,

00:24:24.312 --> 00:24:26.151
that they have to be with the pure people

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.761
and they have to help the pure people. But He so clearly said it

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.360
that if you want Lakshmi,

00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:35.791
you can have it, that’s money.

00:24:37.744 --> 00:24:41.861
But that’s not Mahalakshmi, so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

00:24:43.089 --> 00:24:45.682
You’ve already got your Realization,

00:24:45.682 --> 00:24:47.398
you do not know how much you have got it already

00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:50.451
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:53.654
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle? That’s the point.

00:24:53.852 --> 00:24:56.472
Can I ask this question?

00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:07.843
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

00:25:11.516 --> 00:25:13.740
It’s all for the Spirit.

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.240
Hum?

00:25:14.243 --> 00:25:16.820
It’s all for the Spirit, Mother.

00:25:17.056 --> 00:25:19.056
No, no. But you have a power.

00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:25.121
You have got MahaLakshmi’s powers within you, do you know that?

00:25:26.449 --> 00:25:28.380
Mother? The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:28.880
hmm?

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.402
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:30.402 --> 00:25:30.902
I beg your pardon?

00:25:30.902 --> 00:25:32.330
The pleasure it gives you.

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.843
The pleasure?

00:25:32.843 --> 00:25:33.343
Yes.

00:25:33.343 --> 00:25:34.279
No, no, no.

00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:36.279
The power of giving Realization.

00:25:37.651 --> 00:25:40.122
Go ahead still, a little more, move.

00:25:42.112 --> 00:25:45.530
Pleasure is not a power.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.643
Pleasure is what you enjoy. But it's, you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:52.962
Sustaining power?

00:25:52.962 --> 00:25:53.485
What's it?

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:56.179
Sustaining power.

00:25:56.573 --> 00:26:03.920
That’s no power. Power means, you have that power to do something.

00:26:07.363 --> 00:26:08.742
Potential?

00:26:08.742 --> 00:26:09.943
The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:10.523
Hum?

00:26:10.523 --> 00:26:12.523
The power to spread Sahaja yoga, Mother.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.204
That’s rather vague: particular one.

00:26:16.503 --> 00:26:18.503
Power to give Realization.

00:26:18.503 --> 00:26:21.017
To give Realization, other.

00:26:22.724 --> 00:26:23.743
To evolve Mother.

00:26:25.305 --> 00:26:26.687
To evolve.

00:26:28.674 --> 00:26:30.674
But to evolve is your own.

00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:34.010
Power is what you do to others.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.466
The whole thing, I told you just now, is to purify.

00:26:43.406 --> 00:26:49.996
You have the power to purify. How do you cure people?

00:26:50.856 --> 00:26:56.991
By purifying them. All right?

00:26:59.842 --> 00:27:04.776
Now just think how you purify others, by talking to others

00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:06.909
you can purify them.

00:27:09.713 --> 00:27:15.171
By touching others, you can purify them. By looking at them,

00:27:15.487 --> 00:27:16.860
you can purify them.

00:27:18.283 --> 00:27:20.668
One person who is a Realized soul,

00:27:20.668 --> 00:27:24.488
purifies the whole atmosphere. The atmosphere is purified.

00:27:24.868 --> 00:27:27.214
Since I’ve come, it has been warm enough.

00:27:31.093 --> 00:27:36.187
You purify everything. You purify this light, do you notice that?

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:40.026
You awaken the light.

00:27:45.005 --> 00:27:48.125
Now what other powers you have?

00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:55.899
To raise the Kundalini.

00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:56.473
Hum?

00:27:56.473 --> 00:27:57.434
Raise Kundalini.

00:27:57.843 --> 00:27:59.843
That’s awakening.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.406
You see, Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

00:28:05.691 --> 00:28:07.575
You purify yourselves,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.810
others and yourselves.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.726
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let’s have it.

00:28:16.157 --> 00:28:18.507
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them,

00:28:18.507 --> 00:28:20.449
this is the best part of it!

00:28:22.688 --> 00:28:25.764
Can’t follow it now. Now let’s have it.

00:28:25.764 --> 00:28:28.258
The power to arrange time to suit you, Mother.

00:28:28.258 --> 00:28:29.211
What's this?

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.560
Power over time.

00:28:32.767 --> 00:28:35.267
Arranging time to suit yourself.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.917
But that’s not the power of Mahalakshmi.

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:42.088
That’s another one, I’ll tell you, who does that.

00:28:46.953 --> 00:28:49.211
Balance.

00:28:53.306 --> 00:28:54.617
What do you say?

00:28:54.617 --> 00:28:58.541
It gives a balance between ego and superego.

00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:02.252
That’s true. That is one of them. But that is guru power.

00:29:02.252 --> 00:29:03.982
That is the guru’s power.

00:29:04.258 --> 00:29:06.019
Balance comes from guru.

00:29:08.943 --> 00:29:12.284
You see, Mahalakshmi is water. So, now you tell Me.

00:29:13.807 --> 00:29:14.593
To cleanse.

00:29:15.032 --> 00:29:18.683
That’s all done now, one cleansing is done. What else water does?

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.654
It quenches the thirst.

00:29:21.654 --> 00:29:22.154
Ha?

00:29:22.154 --> 00:29:23.092
Quenches.

00:29:23.834 --> 00:29:24.917
Satisfy.

00:29:24.917 --> 00:29:25.845
Satisfaction.

00:29:25.845 --> 00:29:28.354
Now coming to the heart.

00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:32.249
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

00:29:33.664 --> 00:29:37.747
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power it is,

00:29:37.747 --> 00:29:39.747
because even you doing Realization,

00:29:39.747 --> 00:29:44.101
done! The seeking is over. All right?

00:29:44.887 --> 00:29:48.132
Then another one. Now come along.

00:29:48.132 --> 00:29:49.791
What other power?

00:29:52.672 --> 00:29:54.319
Think of the water.

00:29:58.724 --> 00:30:03.540
Nourishment, you nourish.

00:30:04.196 --> 00:30:07.917
You give spiritual nourishment to people through your power;

00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:11.666
even if you are standing there you are nourishing others.

00:30:14.898 --> 00:30:17.591
Then it's a solvent.

00:30:18.533 --> 00:30:21.209
You dissolve their ego, you dissolve their superego.

00:30:22.452 --> 00:30:25.798
All these powers you own now, after Realization.

00:30:28.413 --> 00:30:32.843
Just think of it. What else?

00:30:32.963 --> 00:30:33.926
Divinity.

00:30:37.396 --> 00:30:39.396
That’s very vague,

00:30:39.396 --> 00:30:44.357
because divinity is how to relate it with water, people won’t understand.

00:30:44.357 --> 00:30:46.841
So, let us put it the other way round.

00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:49.261
What is it?

00:30:49.261 --> 00:30:50.711
To cool down emotions.

00:30:50.711 --> 00:30:51.443
What?

00:30:51.443 --> 00:30:53.939
To cool down emotions and conscience.

00:30:54.053 --> 00:30:56.604
You become a cool down person.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:00.781
Very good!

00:31:04.623 --> 00:31:09.784
Very good. You become cool,

00:31:11.175 --> 00:31:13.702
a cool personality. You have a cooling effect, very good.

00:31:13.702 --> 00:31:14.819
What else?

00:31:14.819 --> 00:31:16.075
You can carry others.

00:31:16.075 --> 00:31:16.575
Hum?

00:31:16.575 --> 00:31:18.575
You can carry others.

00:31:18.934 --> 00:31:21.807
With you, you can, very gently

00:31:22.011 --> 00:31:23.637
and also drown some of them.

00:31:29.309 --> 00:31:33.409
Drown into the love, into the ocean of love.

00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:34.393
All right?

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:39.336
But you can also push them with two running jumps, all right?

00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:43.335
That also can be done.

00:31:44.482 --> 00:31:48.718
It has another very great quality that water permeates

00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:53.897
into the smallest particle. It goes to the roots and it suck through the roots.

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:59.471
So, Mahalakshmi power, you just see the roots of a person.

00:31:59.611 --> 00:32:01.412
You just know where the problem comes from,

00:32:02.278 --> 00:32:03.280
you jump to it.

00:32:03.293 --> 00:32:07.625
Actually, it is the awareness, it is the intelligence which

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:12.359
sucks the truth part of it, which gets enlightened.

00:32:12.594 --> 00:32:19.238
And you understand that now where is the problem, and you just go near the root

00:32:19.453 --> 00:32:24.251
when you suck through it, you can be easily sucked through, you permeate.

00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:26.964
You see, when you are sitting near a person

00:32:27.609 --> 00:32:31.920
and you tell Me, “Mother, this is catching at the back,

00:32:32.225 --> 00:32:33.578
the person doesn’t know.”

00:32:33.578 --> 00:32:35.578
You have permeated. Your personality has

00:32:35.578 --> 00:32:37.578
permeated into that person. He doesn’t know.

00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:41.664
You have permeated into that person and you are feeling the roots, you see

00:32:42.164 --> 00:32:44.164
where is the problem.

00:32:44.164 --> 00:32:45.410
The water is flowing into that being.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.468
The divine water is flowing into that being

00:32:48.553 --> 00:32:50.542
and you, the obstruction is felt

00:32:50.542 --> 00:32:52.990
through that divine water.

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:56.497
And you can say that, "This is catching, that is catching."

00:32:59.823 --> 00:33:01.823
So, the permeating.

00:33:01.823 --> 00:33:04.539
And the another one is the glistening of the water.

00:33:04.904 --> 00:33:10.556
So, your skin starts glistening, your skin becomes very radiant.

00:33:13.186 --> 00:33:16.260
And the last of all is the reflection.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.540
A person, who sees you,

00:33:20.659 --> 00:33:24.033
sees his own reflection. He gets frightened.

00:33:26.028 --> 00:33:28.028
With Me, it this happens sometimes.

00:33:28.487 --> 00:33:30.595
And I don’t mean anything bad to anyone,

00:33:31.155 --> 00:33:34.722
but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

00:33:34.722 --> 00:33:36.049
because they see their reflection.

00:33:37.198 --> 00:33:40.013
So, when they meet you, they see their reflection can be very aggressive,

00:33:40.013 --> 00:33:43.898
because they see their reflection. They can be very hard on you

00:33:43.898 --> 00:33:45.898
because they see their reflection.

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:58.296
And if it is clear-cut water, then you see the depth of the person.

00:34:00.407 --> 00:34:02.407
If you are clear-cut Sahaja Yogi

00:34:02.744 --> 00:34:10.285
they feel the depth, clean, and they can see through  the Spirit shining.

00:34:13.214 --> 00:34:18.229
These are the qualities of water within us.

00:34:20.462 --> 00:34:24.694
The more of that, I would say, especially in my body,

00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:28.022
the water, I actually buffer

00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:30.379
to protect the chakras.

00:34:30.379 --> 00:34:32.379
If I don’t have water in the body,

00:34:32.379 --> 00:34:34.848
then I may have problems.

00:34:34.848 --> 00:34:36.848
So, it acts as a buffer.

00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:43.120
Also, it soothes your epidermal cells, you can say.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.877
it soothes your linings, you see?

00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:50.651
If there is no moisture, it will all give dryness and all that.

00:34:51.418 --> 00:34:53.418
It soothes everyone.

00:34:56.483 --> 00:35:04.204
And there are other types of powers of water, which we know of that when

00:35:04.204 --> 00:35:05.878
it comes out of your eyes

00:35:07.044 --> 00:35:09.492
it expresses your compassion,

00:35:11.038 --> 00:35:13.038
your love, your emotions.

00:35:14.104 --> 00:35:16.104
That is the only thing,

00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:20.863
out of all the elements, which expresses emotions,

00:35:24.424 --> 00:35:27.037
water power, I mean.

00:35:28.924 --> 00:35:34.497
Water has other qualities also which physics people know as hydrostatics,

00:35:34.497 --> 00:35:35.534
it has the pressure.

00:35:36.222 --> 00:35:37.772
It has a pressure

00:35:38.897 --> 00:35:40.897
and a person who exists

00:35:41.357 --> 00:35:42.668
like a Sahaja Yogi,

00:35:42.843 --> 00:35:46.895
will definitely put a pressure on others. He will not,

00:35:47.027 --> 00:35:50.726
he will not aggress but there will be a pressure and pressure.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:57.003
And another person, if he receives it, then he gets the advantage of it.

00:35:57.003 --> 00:35:59.180
But if he does not receive it,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:03.599
then he feel pressurized and he feels a little bit dominated.

00:36:04.975 --> 00:36:07.138
Your neigbhors, your family people,

00:36:07.353 --> 00:36:09.751
at the beginning will feel, "Oh, there's a pressure"

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.770
because the body achieves a kind of a weight.

00:36:15.422 --> 00:36:18.666
And that’s how the Guru tattva is formed out of water.

00:36:20.896 --> 00:36:22.896
And if there is salt,

00:36:24.004 --> 00:36:27.207
that's Guru principle, then the weight is even more.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:34.926
So, today for water, you should really know that

00:36:35.594 --> 00:36:38.885
water is a very holy thing.

00:36:39.283 --> 00:36:42.107
And in our pujas also, we use -

00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:47.098
especially this thing signifies the Kundalini,

00:36:47.098 --> 00:36:51.653
that means the Kundalini is the water jar,

00:36:51.653 --> 00:36:54.819
or the carrier of Aquarius.

00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:57.880
And this is the Age of the Aquarius.

00:36:58.104 --> 00:37:01.263
So, how important is water!

00:37:01.263 --> 00:37:10.215
And the water is the carrier of divine love, is the best carrier.

00:37:10.215 --> 00:37:18.102
And this is the time of Aquarius means the Kundalini is made of divine water.

00:37:20.413 --> 00:37:25.448
So, the whole idea of celebrating,

00:37:25.978 --> 00:37:32.724
today is the Lakshmi’s day, is to understand that in us

00:37:32.724 --> 00:37:35.481
She has become a Mahalakshmi.

00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:41.530
And by that, we have so many powers of which we are not aware,
I mean we do not know also that we are Realized souls,

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.843
some of us do not know,

00:37:42.843 --> 00:37:46.605
and that we have those powers within us that we can permeate into others.

00:37:46.605 --> 00:37:49.308
We can project our personalities onto others.

00:37:49.308 --> 00:37:51.940
We can find out what’s wrong with them.

00:37:53.088 --> 00:37:58.264
We can find out about ourselves. We can go into ourselves,
we can go into - our permeation  is like water

00:37:58.264 --> 00:38:02.668
it's going, it's flowing all the time. And this

00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:07.399
is a very important thing that we should be aware

00:38:07.399 --> 00:38:09.107
of our powers that we have achieved.

00:38:09.107 --> 00:38:12.781
Then we start respecting ourselves then the Rajalakshmi comes in

00:38:13.044 --> 00:38:14.740
and then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

00:38:15.037 --> 00:38:18.683
and everything comes with it when we become aware

00:38:19.061 --> 00:38:24.198
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem,

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:27.829
of our dignity.

00:38:28.553 --> 00:38:32.427
So, this gives us dignity, Mahalakshmi gives us dignity.

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:36.626
And that’s how we start understanding the value of human dignity.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.813
We should have also the idea of human dignity

00:38:42.313 --> 00:38:45.075
that we cannot insult human dignity,

00:38:49.439 --> 00:38:52.897
like people who are nagging others all the time. It’s against

00:38:54.262 --> 00:38:56.475
or all the time asserting themselves about

00:38:56.456 --> 00:38:59.103
something making everybody’s life miserable.

00:38:59.315 --> 00:39:03.311
It’s against human dignity. You have to decorate another's life,

00:39:03.465 --> 00:39:08.572
you have to make it beautiful, you have to make it enjoyable

00:39:08.784 --> 00:39:12.629
and happy, make everyone happy, not to nag all the time.

00:39:13.129 --> 00:39:15.304
And if you nag that’s not a Gruhalakshmi;

00:39:15.516 --> 00:39:18.319
that is not a Gruhalakshmi. You should not nag, “Do this, do that,

00:39:18.473 --> 00:39:21.424
stand up, what are you doing, stand this side, do, go that side.”

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:24.087
It’s all a nonsense. You /?/ the person to do it;

00:39:24.472 --> 00:39:26.310
the human dignity is the most important thing.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.810
Must respect the human dignity.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.208
And that’s possible because now you have got the Mahalakshmi power.

00:39:32.708 --> 00:39:35.831
Those who do not have the dignity also will get it from you

00:39:36.043 --> 00:39:37.627
because you are dignified now.

00:39:38.761 --> 00:39:41.351
If you have sense of dignity, you will never insult other’s dignity.

00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:43.851
For small, small things we insult others

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.305
“Why did you put the soap here, why did you do this, why did you do that?”

00:39:48.728 --> 00:39:50.475
And the another side coud be that others

00:39:50.629 --> 00:39:53.990
have no dignity so they go on doing things just like animals.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.490
The both things are wrong.

00:39:57.336 --> 00:40:02.577
But one must respect and respect brings the best results I have seen.

00:40:03.077 --> 00:40:06.525
That’s the best result, once you respect and love

00:40:08.813 --> 00:40:10.813
and then the trust is grown

00:40:10.852 --> 00:40:12.494
and one should keep the trust.

00:40:12.648 --> 00:40:15.636
And that’s how the human dignity /?/

00:40:16.136 --> 00:40:18.136
We must respect every Sahaja yogi

00:40:18.982 --> 00:40:22.697
because we are all saints, to respect each other,

00:40:23.197 --> 00:40:25.197
absolutely respect because you are all saints.

00:40:25.351 --> 00:40:27.351
I don’t know you realize what I am saying.

00:40:28.774 --> 00:40:33.038
Each one of you is capable of giving realization to the whole world,

00:40:33.538 --> 00:40:34.624
each one of you

00:40:37.604 --> 00:40:41.700
and if we realize then we must respect ourselves and respect others.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.912
You should do not talk frivolously about others, make fun.

00:40:46.392 --> 00:40:48.392
And specially your Mother,

00:40:48.719 --> 00:40:50.719
you can’t take liberties with Her.

00:40:51.969 --> 00:40:53.969
That is something one has to know

00:40:54.469 --> 00:40:58.627
in the west is important. This is very important

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.300
that one has to know about it.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.550
The other day I was correcting somebody.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.050
So Hugh said that “You are a very lucky person

00:41:07.146 --> 00:41:09.009
that Mother is correcting you; you are very lucky

00:41:09.163 --> 00:41:11.163
that She is correcting you, telling you something,

00:41:11.432 --> 00:41:15.890
because you are naive you see, that is why you start taking liberties.”

00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:20.241
First of all you must respect the divinity of your Mother.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.922
That’s very important. And that gives you the greatest dignity.

00:41:26.114 --> 00:41:31.272
I am telling you this because unless and until you do that, your growth

00:41:31.772 --> 00:41:33.772
cannot come up well.

00:41:33.811 --> 00:41:35.811
So that is a very important point

00:41:36.311 --> 00:41:40.639
and like in India supposing somebody is going to a temple

00:41:40.735 --> 00:41:43.506
or they come to - for example, today

00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:46.318
She has come or somebody has come they will better,

00:41:46.414 --> 00:41:47.772
they will wear a nice dress.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.407
You see, you are going to a temple and all the ornaments they will wear,

00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:52.978
everything they will wear.

00:41:53.132 --> 00:41:55.485
That is the day they have to present all their dignity.

00:41:55.985 --> 00:41:58.159
So one should not come with

00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:01.395
dishevel hair or things like that.

00:42:03.337 --> 00:42:07.051
That is not a good thing because all these things are important,

00:42:07.263 --> 00:42:09.263
how you respect.

00:42:09.763 --> 00:42:14.248
How you have to be dressed

00:42:14.517 --> 00:42:16.745
how you have to presentable, because these things

00:42:16.841 --> 00:42:19.084
Some people say that oh /?/

00:42:19.584 --> 00:42:21.584
we don’t need to be tidy because we are the spirit

00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:24.084
Spirit is the most tidy thing.

00:42:24.296 --> 00:42:26.657
It tidies everything you see.

00:42:26.754 --> 00:42:29.812
It tidies everything. It goes into proper synthesis, proper

00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:31.727
concord, a complete,

00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:34.641
beautiful music is created out of that.

00:42:35.141 --> 00:42:38.641
How can a chaotic person be called spiritual man? Cannot,

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.575
anybody who is chaotic, their house is chaotic, their things are chaotic,

00:42:41.671 --> 00:42:43.974
you must know there is something bhootish in them,

00:42:43.998 --> 00:42:45.998
absolutely.

00:42:47.363 --> 00:42:49.363
But you should not be other way round, that

00:42:49.575 --> 00:42:52.102
so meticulous that you eat others’ heads.

00:42:52.615 --> 00:42:55.783
That’s another side. So both things should not be done.

00:42:56.108 --> 00:42:59.288
And I go on insisting on this point because it is very important

00:42:59.788 --> 00:43:01.305
for ego-oriented people

00:43:01.805 --> 00:43:03.805
because they can become anything.

00:43:04.478 --> 00:43:07.529
The other day I was going on King’s Road and I was surprised

00:43:08.087 --> 00:43:10.087
what sort of dresses people are wearing

00:43:10.126 --> 00:43:12.246
and they think that “whatever we wear, we are.”

00:43:12.342 --> 00:43:14.038
That means you must be monkeys,

00:43:14.538 --> 00:43:16.538
you wear such dresses and go about it.

00:43:17.038 --> 00:43:19.506
If you believe in that then you should be decent people,

00:43:19.718 --> 00:43:21.068
there should be decorum about it.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:33.380
So today we have learnt about Lakshmi's growth into Mahalakshmi

00:43:33.995 --> 00:43:37.476
but it is not that when you grow into something the rest of it is finished,

00:43:37.572 --> 00:43:41.362
is not so, that some people think that they become

00:43:41.399 --> 00:43:45.106
spiritual personality now Lakshmi Tattwa is not there, is not true.

00:43:45.952 --> 00:43:47.952
You have to be decent person,

00:43:48.452 --> 00:43:53.109
properly dressed according to your status in life, the way you live.

00:43:53.609 --> 00:43:57.960
And there should be no, what you call, hypocrisy about it,

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.609
no hypocrisy. By doing any

00:44:01.763 --> 00:44:03.763
nonsensical thing,

00:44:03.802 --> 00:44:06.630
like some people think becoming a primitive or anything,

00:44:06.842 --> 00:44:09.018
you will impress others. You will never impress,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.230
you see. It’s beggar’s thing,

00:44:11.499 --> 00:44:15.259
see, doing beggary you will get some beggars bhoot into you.

00:44:16.336 --> 00:44:19.154
So we are not to be beggars, neither we have to be

00:44:19.654 --> 00:44:23.198
a sort of dandies, but we are Sahaja yogis, dignified people.

00:44:23.698 --> 00:44:27.436
We have our own self-esteem and we live with our own dignity,

00:44:27.705 --> 00:44:31.948
and that’s how we should be pure

00:44:32.967 --> 00:44:34.967
transparent, honest,

00:44:36.044 --> 00:44:37.659
within ourselves we should be honest,

00:44:37.813 --> 00:44:40.852
absolutely honest. Water is so honest with itself.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.640
We put anything to the water it will show.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.890
Put any color into it, it will show.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.390
Put any mud it will show.

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:52.196
You have to be so honest, honest to yourself.

00:44:53.215 --> 00:44:56.296
And the whole thing should work out to be a personality

00:44:56.796 --> 00:45:01.550
and be congenial, beautiful, permeating, no doubt

00:45:01.877 --> 00:45:03.757
but very beautifully enlightened

00:45:04.257 --> 00:45:06.257
because Mahalakshmi Tattwa itself

00:45:06.296 --> 00:45:08.296
is enlightenment in our awareness.

00:45:08.796 --> 00:45:11.261
Such a person cannot be an idiot. If there is an idiot

00:45:11.357 --> 00:45:13.357
he is not a Sahaja yogi, definitely he is not.

00:45:14.261 --> 00:45:17.300
Idiotic person cannot be a Sahaja yogi - nitwits,

00:45:19.472 --> 00:45:22.943
absent-minded, all that has to go away.

00:45:23.443 --> 00:45:25.443
If you all have to be sahaja yogis, you cannot be,

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.883
“Oh, I know, I know, I know.” All that nonsense is not be there,

00:45:29.383 --> 00:45:30.266
should not be there.

00:45:31.883 --> 00:45:39.389
The lakshanas or what do you call, the seed tops, or you can say,

00:45:40.523 --> 00:45:44.223
what do you call lakshanas,

00:45:44.723 --> 00:45:48.354
is the way you can make out a Sahaja yogi, should be

00:45:48.854 --> 00:45:53.566
a Lakshmi putra is the sign of Lakshmi like a king /?/

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:57.385
That doesn’t mean that he has everything to him self, no.

00:45:58.116 --> 00:46:00.116
That doesn’t mean that, king gives.

00:46:00.328 --> 00:46:02.522
He gives with generosity, known by his generosity.

00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:05.634
He is not known by how much he grabs, does he?

00:46:06.134 --> 00:46:09.368
He is a king, as it is, is giving.

00:46:12.292 --> 00:46:14.522
Then he should be cool personality.

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:19.294
He should not be frozen. He should be cool personality,

00:46:20.428 --> 00:46:23.280
not hot- tempered. Those who are hot-tempered,

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.513
I have seen people, you see, here

00:46:27.013 --> 00:46:29.359
they first take to violence. I mean violence is

00:46:29.398 --> 00:46:31.574
something out of question for Sahaja yogis,

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.789
no question. If somebody beat you also you are not to beat him back.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.520
We have ways to beat them

00:46:40.885 --> 00:46:42.885
but you are not to beat them back.

00:46:43.904 --> 00:46:45.904
You are not to resist them,

00:46:46.116 --> 00:46:50.068
but if you are a sahaja yogi you have no business to be violent to anyone,

00:46:50.568 --> 00:46:53.051
even with your tongue. Some people are

00:46:53.147 --> 00:46:55.147
more with the tongue provocating type.

00:46:55.647 --> 00:46:58.559
You must know that you must correct all these points.

00:46:59.059 --> 00:47:03.041
It is important because tomorrow if you are going to show to the world

00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:05.541
what Sahaja Yoga is not /?/

00:47:10.828 --> 00:47:12.828
So we have to dedicate ourselves

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.573
to our purification,

00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:17.605
to our glorification because water glorifies,

00:47:18.105 --> 00:47:20.105
gives you glory.

00:47:20.201 --> 00:47:23.524
You are all looking so nice and glistening on the face and I can see

00:47:23.562 --> 00:47:25.444
the Ganti Rupena Samasthita.

00:47:25.598 --> 00:47:29.939
He said that “Ya Devi Sarva Butheshu Ganti Rupena,” the glistening,

00:47:29.978 --> 00:47:34.692
the light and that’s there I can see you in you all.

00:47:34.904 --> 00:47:40.271
It has already come but it should be inside also.

00:47:41.636 --> 00:47:44.679
And that person who is a realized soul

00:47:44.833 --> 00:47:47.234
one doesn’t have to vow for it.

00:47:48.022 --> 00:47:50.022
people just know that he is realized soul.

00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:55.023
You don’t have to tell anyone people just know the way he is.

00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:59.657
So many points we have covered today.

00:47:59.984 --> 00:48:01.984
I hope you will

00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:03.497
again listen to them because,

00:48:03.593 --> 00:48:06.987
see, Mataji’s lecture goes from one ear and comes out from the other.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.740
Thank God we have a way of localizing it.

00:48:12.009 --> 00:48:14.009
I hope you people will take these tapes

00:48:14.105 --> 00:48:17.371
and listen to them everyday one by one

00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:20.659
and also act, not planning

00:48:20.871 --> 00:48:24.865
in the paper or in the ear. But it should go in the heart.

00:48:27.268 --> 00:48:29.268
That’s how we are all going to mature

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.796
beautiful children. I’m just counting

00:48:33.296 --> 00:48:39.149
now again C.P. will be elected for four years and then I have to

00:48:39.649 --> 00:48:44.994
there is hardly three years it will pass away and

00:48:46.071 --> 00:48:48.372
I won’t be able to go so much in U.K.

00:48:48.872 --> 00:48:51.509
The responsibility, such a lot on you people.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.637
I hope we celebrate some more Diwalis together.

00:48:57.465 --> 00:48:59.465
May God bless you!
