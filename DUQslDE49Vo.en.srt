1
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:15,013
Put your right hand on the Brahmarandhra.

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:23,891
Just here. Push it! Move it. Clockwise.

3
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:30,028
Now the whole of this parting you can move.

4
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:33,340
All the seven chakras are here.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,133
You can start it from here (the back) if you want.

6
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:42,188
Back side you should move the other way round (anti-clockwise).

7
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:45,741
Here also (apex of the head at the back) the other way round.

8
00:00:46,382 --> 00:00:56,039
Now. Especially here, Left Nabhi.

9
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:04,747
Now, put it on the Brahmarandhra. Move it.

10
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:08,047
Now, in the clockwise manner.

11
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,445
Now bring it here.

12
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:19,969
Vishuddhi. Must move Vishuddhi quite a lot.

13
00:01:21,945 --> 00:01:23,833
This is the Viraata’s thing.

14
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,601
Now the Agya (with the Agya finger only).

15
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:34,992
Now the Hamsa, just with this finger (the Vishuddhi finger).

16
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,328
Better now?

17
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:53,219
Relieved?

18
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,656
Much better.

19
00:01:56,258 --> 00:02:04,047
Also you can, for your Vishuddhi, you should put your right hand here

20
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,724
and rub it the other way round, means anti-clockwise.

21
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:11,719
Vishuddhi. Move it!

22
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,945
No with your fingers! Press it hard with your fingers!

23
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,289
You can massage yourself I mean to say.

24
00:02:22,437 --> 00:02:26,055
Just do it like that. It will be nice.

25
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,523
Other way round!

26
00:02:35,852 --> 00:02:43,500
Better now ???. Now much better. Not this way but take it this way.

27
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,774
More on the Left Vishuddhi now.

28
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,601
With a little oil it will be alright.

29
00:02:54,721 --> 00:03:00,391
It’s good! Feeling better now?

30
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:03,423
Much better?

31
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:10,844
Cleared out. Much better now.

32
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:13,320
Alright.

33
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,512
So you can yourself massage.

34
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,146
For example if your eyesight is not alright, massage it here (on back Agnya).

35
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:29,193
You can take the name of Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava here

36
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:31,360
and it will work out.

37
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:37,130
With your fingers please, with your fingers.

38
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,164
You have to rub it with your fingers. Press it hard!

39
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,672
If it is on the Left Side you can feel it or it is on the Right Side.

40
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,568
That’s why I said, “Put oil.”

41
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,044
That doesn’t mean putting oil means just straight forward

42
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:56,250
pour it into your head but rub it with your fingers. Now better?

43
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:01,883
Stopped? Coughing has stopped now.

44
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:06,266
Alright. Better now. See now it’s coming out.

45
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:12,281
Good! The heat is coming out a little bit.

46
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:19,649
Now put the right hand towards me and left hand (above Sahastrar).

47
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,571
Haaa, better!

48
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:37,473
Try with the left hand again. Left hand and right hand (above Sahastrar).

49
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:39,977
Bend your heads! Bend your head!

50
00:04:41,203 --> 00:04:44,547
Haaa! That’s like humbling down! You know?

51
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:51,579
Good? Fine? Feeling better now?
