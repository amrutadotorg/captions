00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:07.263
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:16.233
as a very great personality.

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:22.443
And you know why He came on this earth –

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:32.323
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:44.213
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:57.233
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

00:00:57.363 --> 00:01:06.403
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:11.343
And you had very great leaders

00:01:14.253 --> 00:01:16.293
who followed Him

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:24.213
and who worshipped Him in a way,

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:31.243
and created a new world of this America.

00:01:33.383 --> 00:01:36.373
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:44.423
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:50.333
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:56.213
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

00:01:56.373 --> 00:01:59.303
about Shri Krishna:

00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:10.343
that He was a great master of wealth,

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:18.243
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

00:02:18.373 --> 00:02:22.373
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:28.383
They all forgot about it completely

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:33.273
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:43.303
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:52.203
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:59.323
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:03.413
He achieves money;

00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:08.213
and not only that,

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:12.223
He is living, He lived in money.

00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:19.363
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:25.283
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:28.323
but it submerged in the water,

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:35.303
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:40.303
But now they have found out His house under the water,

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:42.233
very deep waters,

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:50.233
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:54.403
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:56.403
by dharma.

00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:02.253
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:05.243
out of gold.

00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:09.333
It is still there and people have found it,

00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:13.363
but under the sea.

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:19.203
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

00:04:20.223 --> 00:04:23.403
Only because perhaps it belonged to Shri Krishna,

00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:26.273
it is still existing.

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:31.293
That’s what it is, because He was the one

00:04:31.423 --> 00:04:35.303
who was for satya first – truth.

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:42.353
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

00:04:43.243 --> 00:04:46.413
on the principle of truth.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:51.243
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

00:04:51.383 --> 00:04:58.283
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:05.403
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

00:05:06.323 --> 00:05:10.393
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

00:05:11.363 --> 00:05:16.233
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:23.203
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.273
money at all,

00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:30.203
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

00:05:30.403 --> 00:05:33.363
I’m so hopelessly bad –

00:05:34.273 --> 00:05:38.443
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

00:05:39.353 --> 00:05:44.273
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

00:05:45.273 --> 00:05:47.443
But He’s there to look after,

00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:52.433
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

00:05:53.443 --> 00:05:58.223
wealth, it’s all full of it.

00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:04.293
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:08.383
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

00:06:09.253 --> 00:06:13.433
you don’t look for money.

00:06:14.323 --> 00:06:18.363
What happened in your country that some people got money.

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:23.233
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:26.243
They’re not satisfied people.

00:06:26.373 --> 00:06:31.403
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:36.383
It is something very much human.

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:40.433
After your human evolution,

00:06:41.303 --> 00:06:45.263
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:52.443
then all these demeaning things like greed

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:57.293
all disappear from your character.

00:06:57.293 --> 00:07:01.383
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:07.213
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:11.433
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

00:07:13.213 --> 00:07:21.333
It is just that you think you don’t need it, and you’ll get it.

00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:25.443
All done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:29.323
He’s doing all this, looking after you

00:07:30.203 --> 00:07:33.443
and helping you with money.

00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:37.413
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

00:07:38.303 --> 00:07:41.303
I don’t, never had any problem.

00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:49.293
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:53.223
He looks after people who don’t have money.

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:57.263
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

00:07:57.423 --> 00:08:02.353
who enjoy the life of truth.

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:17.383
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

00:08:18.423 --> 00:08:20.343
They have this much, they want to have more;

00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:23.353
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

00:08:24.223 --> 00:08:27.243
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

00:08:27.383 --> 00:08:32.293
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:36.353
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

00:08:37.253 --> 00:08:39.353
whatever you have.

00:08:40.223 --> 00:08:43.303
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

00:08:43.413 --> 00:08:47.313
and you don’t hanker after something, that is not there.

00:08:47.413 --> 00:08:50.223
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

00:08:51.243 --> 00:08:53.213
Many a times people have asked Me,

00:08:53.343 --> 00:08:58.353
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:00.323
I said, “All right.

00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:03.273
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

00:09:03.403 --> 00:09:05.363
Let them learn a lesson,

00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:09.373
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

00:09:10.223 --> 00:09:15.263
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

00:09:16.443 --> 00:09:21.323
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:26.353
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:32.213
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

00:09:32.313 --> 00:09:35.443
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

00:09:36.273 --> 00:09:38.363
Where is that money gone?

00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:40.253
They’re very clever.

00:09:40.343 --> 00:09:43.443
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

00:09:43.443 --> 00:09:46.323
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

00:09:46.403 --> 00:09:48.433
you can’t get out that money.”

00:09:49.293 --> 00:09:53.283
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:59.263
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:03.433
that they'll be caught up,

00:10:04.363 --> 00:10:08.243
and they continued for so many years.

00:10:09.343 --> 00:10:12.283
But I’m sure one day

00:10:12.353 --> 00:10:16.373
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

00:10:17.303 --> 00:10:22.293
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:28.283
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:33.213
what lies behind the money,

00:10:37.363 --> 00:10:43.203
what is the point of having money.

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:45.243
This country had money.

00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:50.363
As a result so many good people came here to work,

00:10:51.213 --> 00:10:54.273
and you had so many complementary things.

00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:58.383
You had lots of people who have complemented,

00:10:59.223 --> 00:11:03.203
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

00:11:03.303 --> 00:11:07.283
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

00:11:07.353 --> 00:11:09.423
they were little bit lacking.

00:11:10.273 --> 00:11:13.253
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

00:11:13.343 --> 00:11:18.383
and also they were very focused people,

00:11:19.213 --> 00:11:21.313
so they worked it out very well.

00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:26.243
Also they respected people who came with brains.

00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:29.423
So this is what happens when you forget

00:11:30.313 --> 00:11:34.213
that truth is the main point.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:39.223
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:44.203
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:50.353
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

00:11:52.203 --> 00:11:55.373
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas, lastly.

00:11:57.223 --> 00:11:59.323
And when we stopped at that airport

00:12:00.233 --> 00:12:03.243
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

00:12:03.403 --> 00:12:05.393
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

00:12:06.273 --> 00:12:07.383
in their family or what has happened.

00:12:08.303 --> 00:12:10.263
First I couldn’t understand.

00:12:10.383 --> 00:12:14.323
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

00:12:18.413 --> 00:12:22.313
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:24.443
they are crying because they have lost the money.

00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:27.323
What’s the use of such a money

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:32.213
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:37.443
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

00:12:38.353 --> 00:12:45.213
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

00:12:45.403 --> 00:12:50.293
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

00:12:50.433 --> 00:12:54.413
with that little money, they buy something.

00:12:55.283 --> 00:12:58.263
Then they think money is very important.

00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:01.303
You see, you can buy lots of things,

00:13:01.403 --> 00:13:04.313
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:10.323
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

00:13:10.443 --> 00:13:15.213
after that mad money which makes you mad.

00:13:15.323 --> 00:13:19.423
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:23.403
the falsehood of this maya money.

00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:28.223
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

00:13:28.353 --> 00:13:34.213
and all their power of money was finished.

00:13:34.373 --> 00:13:39.323
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

00:13:40.363 --> 00:13:46.283
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

00:13:46.423 --> 00:13:52.443
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

00:13:54.223 --> 00:13:56.283
Now money matters:

00:13:56.423 --> 00:14:02.213
He first befools you that you run after it,

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:07.383
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:13.203
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

00:14:13.313 --> 00:14:15.283
He got little money,

00:14:15.423 --> 00:14:21.263
and he got into the grab of this maya.

00:14:21.383 --> 00:14:24.423
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

00:14:25.273 --> 00:14:28.223
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

00:14:28.373 --> 00:14:32.243
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:37.243
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:40.293
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:42.303
and it was like that he was talking.

00:14:43.253 --> 00:14:48.433
And while thinking about it in his mind, he went off to sleep,

00:14:49.293 --> 00:14:52.393
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

00:14:53.233 --> 00:14:56.283
and all the eggs broke.

00:14:56.393 --> 00:14:59.333
So the maya was over.

00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:03.303
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:08.303
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

00:15:08.443 --> 00:15:15.223
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

00:15:15.303 --> 00:15:18.273
complete vision of the destruction

00:15:18.393 --> 00:15:23.213
that can follow this maya business.

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:28.273
It is something, such an insight

00:15:28.403 --> 00:15:31.303
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

00:15:32.243 --> 00:15:36.213
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

00:15:36.323 --> 00:15:40.213
But even if you understand the value of money,

00:15:40.313 --> 00:15:44.223
even if you understand that money can bring

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:49.293
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

00:15:49.373 --> 00:15:55.363
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:59.283
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:04.223
It’s not that he does something for that, or tells his mind, nothing.

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:09.263
Temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

00:16:09.353 --> 00:16:13.343
just because he’s above it.

00:16:13.443 --> 00:16:17.373
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

00:16:18.213 --> 00:16:21.403
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:26.223
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:28.333
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

00:16:28.413 --> 00:16:31.203
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:35.323
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

00:16:36.203 --> 00:16:39.303
we have certain viruses in India also.

00:16:39.443 --> 00:16:42.213
So they still go on running after money,

00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:44.333
to them money is important.

00:16:45.243 --> 00:16:48.423
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

00:16:49.293 --> 00:16:52.343
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:58.203
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money is not so important,

00:16:58.313 --> 00:17:00.373
it’s not so important.

00:17:05.243 --> 00:17:14.233
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

00:17:15.393 --> 00:17:17.433
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:22.343
they have, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

00:17:23.213 --> 00:17:28.203
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:34.323
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

00:17:34.433 --> 00:17:39.303
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

00:17:41.233 --> 00:17:43.443
Come here and fix it please.

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:52.373
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

00:17:57.303 --> 00:18:01.293
Correct, now all right.

00:18:03.393 --> 00:18:11.393
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

00:18:19.293 --> 00:18:21.413
to their spirit,

00:18:22.313 --> 00:18:28.293
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:35.263
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

00:18:36.303 --> 00:18:38.233
This is something

00:18:38.403 --> 00:18:43.203
very, very simple,

00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:46.283
but sometimes you don’t do it.

00:18:46.423 --> 00:18:52.213
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:55.323
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

00:18:56.213 --> 00:19:00.223
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

00:19:01.383 --> 00:19:03.343
But people have;

00:19:04.233 --> 00:19:06.263
they think by that people are impressed,

00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:09.353
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

00:19:10.273 --> 00:19:13.423
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

00:19:14.283 --> 00:19:16.403
What do we get out of it?

00:19:17.263 --> 00:19:22.323
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:24.303
more than anything else.

00:19:25.213 --> 00:19:26.423
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

00:19:27.293 --> 00:19:30.223
It’s a headache to possess things also.

00:19:30.363 --> 00:19:34.313
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

00:19:35.303 --> 00:19:38.383
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:41.403
you’ll have never a problem of money.

00:19:42.273 --> 00:19:45.283
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

00:19:45.413 --> 00:19:49.423
So far as I am concerned,

00:19:50.283 --> 00:19:54.343
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

00:19:55.223 --> 00:19:57.313
because I don’t know from where it works out,

00:19:57.433 --> 00:20:03.343
how it works out, without any effort.

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:10.443
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

00:20:11.323 --> 00:20:13.403
temperamentally.

00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:21.323
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

00:20:23.253 --> 00:20:27.213
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

00:20:27.363 --> 00:20:31.423
it will sell at least ten times more.

00:20:32.313 --> 00:20:36.363
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

00:20:37.423 --> 00:20:43.333
It’s very surprising – automatically.

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:51.203
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

00:20:51.393 --> 00:20:56.423
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

00:20:57.343 --> 00:21:01.363
So what I have to tell you is this,

00:21:02.273 --> 00:21:07.393
that you should not worry about your financial situations

00:21:08.243 --> 00:21:10.233
at all.

00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:12.293
Do not go on calculating,

00:21:12.413 --> 00:21:17.203
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

00:21:17.323 --> 00:21:19.203
what you have to do with your money,

00:21:19.313 --> 00:21:20.343
where you should invest.

00:21:21.243 --> 00:21:25.203
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

00:21:25.373 --> 00:21:29.293
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:21:29.423 --> 00:21:33.203
It all works automatically.

00:21:33.313 --> 00:21:37.293
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

00:21:37.433 --> 00:21:41.253
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

00:21:41.413 --> 00:21:45.343
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:46.253 --> 00:21:54.433
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

00:21:56.263 --> 00:21:59.353
You don’t know what is greed is.

00:22:00.443 --> 00:22:05.323
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

00:22:05.433 --> 00:22:08.293
generous.

00:22:08.433 --> 00:22:13.223
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

00:22:13.353 --> 00:22:16.323
That may be another way of doing it.

00:22:17.313 --> 00:22:23.253
Supposing you get something in your house

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:27.273
and you think it is too much.

00:22:28.203 --> 00:22:31.233
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

00:22:31.233 --> 00:22:33.253
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:35.253
whom can you give?

00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:37.443
And immediately you’ll remember,

00:22:38.303 --> 00:22:42.303
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

00:22:43.203 --> 00:22:46.363
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

00:22:47.243 --> 00:22:50.313
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:55.203
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:04.293
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

00:23:04.413 --> 00:23:09.243
how people like your generosity.

00:23:09.363 --> 00:23:12.363
So you have to be generous, just generous;

00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:15.333
not with yourself, but with others.

00:23:16.223 --> 00:23:21.253
As much as possible, be generous.

00:23:22.313 --> 00:23:30.293
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

00:23:30.413 --> 00:23:33.293
of your love.

00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:37.393
Many a times it has happened with Me

00:23:38.273 --> 00:23:42.393
that I saw somebody needed something,

00:23:44.223 --> 00:23:46.283
and kept it in My mind.

00:23:46.443 --> 00:23:50.293
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

00:23:51.213 --> 00:23:56.343
And the amount of love that person gave Me

00:23:57.223 --> 00:23:59.243
was thousand time more

00:23:59.383 --> 00:24:07.203
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:11.303
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

00:24:11.403 --> 00:24:16.243
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

00:24:16.353 --> 00:24:18.423
I mean, I was surprised.

00:24:19.283 --> 00:24:21.383
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:24.373
I said, “Just out of love.”

00:24:25.253 --> 00:24:28.283
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

00:24:28.373 --> 00:24:31.233
“What a generosity is!”

00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:35.423
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

00:24:37.303 --> 00:24:41.203
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:45.413
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

00:24:46.263 --> 00:24:48.383
If you do that,

00:24:49.273 --> 00:24:54.283
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

00:24:55.293 --> 00:25:02.403
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

00:25:04.203 --> 00:25:09.323
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:15.353
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

00:25:16.213 --> 00:25:20.313
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

00:25:21.433 --> 00:25:23.443
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

00:25:24.313 --> 00:25:26.233
in what conditions.

00:25:26.343 --> 00:25:30.313
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

00:25:31.293 --> 00:25:34.263
That will be just shocking.

00:25:34.373 --> 00:25:37.323
Sometimes, you see, you see people

00:25:38.433 --> 00:25:42.353
in India also in a very bad condition.

00:25:43.213 --> 00:25:45.373
Once I went to Calcutta

00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:52.403
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

00:25:53.263 --> 00:25:58.243
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

00:25:58.423 --> 00:26:03.353
very great poverty, even the children.

00:26:04.223 --> 00:26:07.413
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

00:26:08.303 --> 00:26:12.243
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

00:26:12.343 --> 00:26:14.303
what to do.

00:26:14.413 --> 00:26:17.423
Because I felt, “What is this?

00:26:18.323 --> 00:26:21.323
Why these people are so poor?”

00:26:21.423 --> 00:26:25.323
And I was helpless so I was crying,

00:26:25.413 --> 00:26:31.303
that one day I should try to do something for them.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:36.213
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

00:26:36.433 --> 00:26:45.263
I started a leper home, I started an infirmary, a refugee home,

00:26:46.293 --> 00:26:48.323
all kinds of things.

00:26:50.283 --> 00:26:55.413
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

00:26:57.273 --> 00:27:04.273
if I gave to these people I may have to give up some things.

00:27:05.283 --> 00:27:07.343
I also sold some of My things,

00:27:08.213 --> 00:27:12.333
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

00:27:13.213 --> 00:27:16.363
so joy-giving to be generous.

00:27:17.343 --> 00:27:24.263
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

00:27:24.433 --> 00:27:27.373
That is the quality of Kubera.

00:27:28.283 --> 00:27:32.273
He’s an extremely generous personality,

00:27:33.283 --> 00:27:37.343
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:41.353
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

00:27:42.353 --> 00:27:48.213
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

00:27:48.343 --> 00:27:51.303
so far, so far.

00:27:52.263 --> 00:27:57.443
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

00:27:58.303 --> 00:28:02.213
of very high quality.

00:28:02.323 --> 00:28:06.283
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:12.333
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

00:28:13.213 --> 00:28:18.443
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

00:28:19.303 --> 00:28:22.323
Don’t give up anything.

00:28:22.423 --> 00:28:26.423
You have to give up from your heart.

00:28:27.303 --> 00:28:29.423
Just it should happen in your personality.

00:28:30.273 --> 00:28:32.413
You don’t have to give up.

00:28:33.293 --> 00:28:42.213
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

00:28:43.223 --> 00:28:50.263
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

00:28:51.353 --> 00:28:54.303
On the contrary,

00:28:54.443 --> 00:28:57.393
you would like to give up everything.

00:28:58.263 --> 00:29:01.263
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

00:29:02.313 --> 00:29:05.333
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:10.343
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

00:29:11.203 --> 00:29:13.313
So one day a thief came

00:29:14.203 --> 00:29:17.363
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

00:29:18.213 --> 00:29:21.393
these big horn ones – he took away.

00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:25.363
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

00:29:26.243 --> 00:29:27.303
So My mother asked him,

00:29:27.403 --> 00:29:29.333
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

00:29:30.213 --> 00:29:33.323
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

00:29:33.443 --> 00:29:40.313
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

00:29:41.313 --> 00:29:44.443
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

00:29:45.313 --> 00:29:48.263
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

00:29:48.383 --> 00:29:51.413
your records?”

00:29:53.353 --> 00:29:59.273
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:02.423
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

00:30:03.283 --> 00:30:07.423
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

00:30:08.303 --> 00:30:13.233
But if you force it through religion,

00:30:13.373 --> 00:30:18.203
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:21.213
don’t have to give up.

00:30:21.343 --> 00:30:25.343
You give up from within.

00:30:26.293 --> 00:30:30.323
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

00:30:30.443 --> 00:30:34.263
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

00:30:34.403 --> 00:30:39.403
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

00:30:40.303 --> 00:30:44.403
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:49.243
but they lack generosity.

00:30:49.363 --> 00:30:52.363
That is another quality of Kubera.

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:56.393
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

00:30:57.263 --> 00:31:01.253
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

00:31:01.353 --> 00:31:04.233
because the way He manages banks, you know,

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:08.283
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

00:31:08.403 --> 00:31:13.213
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

00:31:13.363 --> 00:31:14.413
I don’t know.

00:31:15.283 --> 00:31:21.293
But He’s a very clever person,

00:31:23.443 --> 00:31:25.423
very intelligent,

00:31:26.293 --> 00:31:28.313
very alert,

00:31:29.353 --> 00:31:34.353
which is important if you have to deal with money –

00:31:35.403 --> 00:31:40.253
though He was absolutely detached from money.

00:31:41.213 --> 00:31:44.223
And just see His life, what He did.

00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:49.243
He lived in childhood with His guru,

00:31:49.403 --> 00:31:51.363
and He used to take

00:31:52.243 --> 00:32:01.323
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:09.333
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

00:32:12.223 --> 00:32:16.433
He was playing with the boys

00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:21.433
who were looking after the cows in a very,

00:32:22.333 --> 00:32:25.273
I mean, ordinary family.

00:32:29.253 --> 00:32:32.323
He never hankered after money.

00:32:33.293 --> 00:32:34.433
He used to steal,

00:32:36.423 --> 00:32:42.223
used to steal the butter,

00:32:42.413 --> 00:32:48.323
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

00:32:52.323 --> 00:32:55.253
military people.

00:32:56.203 --> 00:32:58.303
So He used to eat that,

00:32:58.403 --> 00:33:02.233
so that this lady should not give it to them.

00:33:02.373 --> 00:33:06.293
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

00:33:06.413 --> 00:33:13.313
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

00:33:14.203 --> 00:33:17.413
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

00:33:18.293 --> 00:33:20.423
to these horrible soldiers,

00:33:21.283 --> 00:33:26.273
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

00:33:26.383 --> 00:33:29.323
In everything that He did,

00:33:30.203 --> 00:33:35.353
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

00:33:37.203 --> 00:33:42.223
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

00:33:46.443 --> 00:33:50.403
And He killed

00:33:54.433 --> 00:33:58.413
His own uncle, I should say;

00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:03.293
but for Him it is, was not important,

00:34:04.293 --> 00:34:07.363
so-called relations were not important.

00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:11.363
But what you see in our India specially,

00:34:12.243 --> 00:34:14.383
that relations are very important.

00:34:15.243 --> 00:34:19.333
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

00:34:19.423 --> 00:34:24.293
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:30.293
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

00:34:30.393 --> 00:34:35.213
any one his progeny are honest.

00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:40.373
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

00:34:41.373 --> 00:34:45.353
that they don’t think is important.

00:34:46.233 --> 00:34:51.353
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

00:34:52.253 --> 00:34:56.393
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

00:34:57.203 --> 00:34:58.283
I have seen our servants.

00:34:58.423 --> 00:35:01.383
They never steal anything, nothing, never.

00:35:02.343 --> 00:35:04.413
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

00:35:05.273 --> 00:35:07.253
it’s a matter of habit.

00:35:07.343 --> 00:35:12.423
They never steal anything – very surprising.

00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:18.373
Why, why don’t they steal?

00:35:19.353 --> 00:35:24.333
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

00:35:24.423 --> 00:35:30.213
They don’t want to have these horrible things

00:35:30.343 --> 00:35:32.393
that can put them in jail.

00:35:33.243 --> 00:35:35.293
But they don’t know,

00:35:35.373 --> 00:35:40.203
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

00:35:41.203 --> 00:35:46.323
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

00:35:47.223 --> 00:35:50.433
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

00:35:51.273 --> 00:35:53.213
very developed.

00:35:53.303 --> 00:36:01.253
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

00:36:01.343 --> 00:36:04.243
honest, and they are all honest.

00:36:04.403 --> 00:36:08.443
One of them may be not,

00:36:09.303 --> 00:36:12.443
but they have no respect for such a person,

00:36:13.343 --> 00:36:18.413
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:22.293
Can you imagine these poor people?

00:36:22.403 --> 00:36:26.323
They have food once a day,

00:36:26.423 --> 00:36:30.313
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

00:36:30.423 --> 00:36:36.393
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

00:36:37.403 --> 00:36:40.433
your self-respect.

00:36:41.283 --> 00:36:43.343
Why should you steal,

00:36:43.443 --> 00:36:46.273
why should you have anything that is stolen,

00:36:46.403 --> 00:36:48.393
or why should you have anything that belongs

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:51.343
to another person?

00:36:52.263 --> 00:36:54.373
If you have that self-respect within you,

00:36:55.233 --> 00:37:00.283
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

00:37:01.363 --> 00:37:04.413
When the servants can do that, why not people

00:37:05.273 --> 00:37:09.263
who are not that badly off?

00:37:09.373 --> 00:37:15.233
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

00:37:15.353 --> 00:37:18.253
which they develop, where their self-respect

00:37:18.373 --> 00:37:23.223
is much more important than all kinds of

00:37:23.323 --> 00:37:27.323
other things that may satisfy their greed.

00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:33.213
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

00:37:33.323 --> 00:37:36.203
It is never satisfied.

00:37:36.313 --> 00:37:39.203
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

00:37:39.303 --> 00:37:41.393
became very, very poor.

00:37:42.283 --> 00:37:45.273
So to them life has become hell.

00:37:45.393 --> 00:37:51.253
They can’t live with, without their great,

00:37:52.363 --> 00:37:57.343
I should say, pomp and show,

00:37:58.213 --> 00:38:01.223
but they don’t understand that it was false.

00:38:01.373 --> 00:38:06.303
They just go on feeling extremely

00:38:07.313 --> 00:38:11.353
downtrodden when they lose their money.

00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:16.353
Then there are people who want to have money;

00:38:17.213 --> 00:38:23.203
they’ll do anything but get money.

00:38:23.323 --> 00:38:29.353
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

00:38:30.223 --> 00:38:32.353
If you have your own powers,

00:38:33.203 --> 00:38:35.363
you don’t hanker after these powers.

00:38:35.363 --> 00:38:37.433
But they want to have power because

00:38:38.273 --> 00:38:42.353
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

00:38:42.433 --> 00:38:44.323
can you imagine?

00:38:44.423 --> 00:38:47.423
Where are human beings, at what level?

00:38:48.283 --> 00:38:51.243
At what level of evolution they are?

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:56.443
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

00:38:57.353 --> 00:39:00.393
This is Nabhi Chakra

00:39:01.253 --> 00:39:03.293
which has to improve,

00:39:03.373 --> 00:39:06.393
which gives you satisfaction.

00:39:07.263 --> 00:39:10.223
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

00:39:10.323 --> 00:39:14.303
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

00:39:14.403 --> 00:39:18.203
That’s very important, to see

00:39:18.303 --> 00:39:22.433
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:27.273
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

00:39:27.393 --> 00:39:31.313
but I think now the worst is this greed.

00:39:31.423 --> 00:39:36.333
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

00:39:36.423 --> 00:39:39.333
brought to its own level,

00:39:39.433 --> 00:39:43.283
then I think world will improve very much.

00:39:43.283 --> 00:39:45.213
May God bless you.
