00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.750
So yesterday was a nice day for all of us, and I said something

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.500
of a different level.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.375
We've been talking all the time

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.083
about the mundane things

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:33.792
and these things sometimes are very ...

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:47.999
are of so much importance, we think.

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.750
But when I talked to you yesterday,

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.999
I hope you all realized

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.291
that we have to now jump into

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:03.291
another realm of a subtler understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.500
First we are worried about

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:09.875
our families, our children,

00:01:11.792 --> 00:01:13.208
our households;

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.667
then, our marriages.

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:24.375
One after another all these questions came up,

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.208
and we were concerned about all these things;

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.999
little, little things.

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.375
Then we also got concerned about the ashrams

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:35.917
which we were running:

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.999
the problems of the ashram,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.625
what we have been doing,

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:46.417
how we have been facing the problems,

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:48.875
how people are creating problems.

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:54.208
That's how our humanity started

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.417
acquiring a subtler understanding.

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.999
And then we also realized that

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.041
we are blessed by God,

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:08.166
that there's something great

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.625
that is always looking after us,

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.792
some higher Force,

00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:21.166
some special Attention is there about us.

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.875
This is what we realized.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:30.417
Today I was explaining how it happens,

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.625
that how we realize

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:44.875
that God is helping us too.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.834
Any problem is an effect of some sort of a cause

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:53.333
- every problem.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.709
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.041
in a motorway

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.500
and the car went out of control,

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.333
and the brake would not act.

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:13.083
And there was a car coming from the right,

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:14.709
car coming from the left,

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.667
cars going through in front and behind.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:21.125
And she felt that they'll be finished

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:24.458
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:32.667
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:37.250
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.333
So now, how to overcome that problem?

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:46.792
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:48.667
because cause is still there.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.917
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:53.959
Then what to do?

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:58.125
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:04.709
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:07.792
so the cause does not exist for you,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.959
so the effect does not exist for you.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.542
As long as the cause exists in your attention,

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:14.667
the effect will be there.

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:16.792
So what did she do?

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:19.750
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.667
"Mother, now it's my last chance" - that's all.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.999
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:33.166
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:42.750
So you must ascend away from the cause.

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.750
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.166
"my husband like this," "my family life is this,"

00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:55.083
"Sahaja yogis are like this" - all kinds of things are there.

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:58.166
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:01.375
- is such and such person.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.959
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:05.875
Surrender it.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:09.542
You are, you have the right to do that.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:13.500
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.875
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.625
- but you don't do it, you forget.

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.959
You just forget.

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:27.834
If you surrender that cause,

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:29.999
the effects will go away.

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:33.667
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:36.208
that you have to ascend.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.875
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:46.375
So I've been playing with you.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:47.792
You had causes to say,

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:49.999
"Oh Mother, this is the problem. I have no job."

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.417
Now I have a job, then the job is to be hard.

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:55.291
Then the wife is not there, so must have a wife.

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:57.667
The wife has a problem, so she is to be divorced

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:00.792
- and that and that, and this is that.

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:02.291
Then, "I am like that.

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:05.166
I am very bad because there's a bhoot in me."

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.083
So the bhoot is the cause.

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:13.792
"And I am behaving like this because there's a bhoot in me."

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:17.417
That's also a scapegoat, I think.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:23.208
So first you go beyond that, saying,

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.291
"What is bhoot? Who is bhoot?

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.041
I know my Mother.

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:35.083
And Mother, You look after this bhoot of mine" - that's all.

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:40.333
But for that an emergency has to come to you,

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:44.417
otherwise you just don't do it, with that power.

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:47.792
When you are in emergent condition,

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:49.917
then it works out faster.

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:53.625
When it is not emergency then it's half-hearted,

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:56.041
like Mona's condition.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:58.375
There was another case where a

00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:04.166
journalist was traveling from ...

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:10.041
or something and his brakes broke down,

00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:11.959
and he was with another journalist,

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:15.000
so both of them were coming - this another journalist told me.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.166
The another one was Sahaja yogi.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:20.500
So he found his brakes are not working

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:26.834
and he found his car is going,

00:07:26.834 --> 00:07:29.125
in front there is a big truck coming up

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:31.375
and another truck coming from behind.

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:34.959
And there was no way for him to turn or to get out of it,

00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:36.750
and his brakes were horrid.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.125
That was a emergency, you see.

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.458
Such an emergency that developed into his mind,

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:45.041
that "Oh God, now the last moment has come.

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:46.458
Now we're finished."

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:49.166
There is a truck coming from there and another truck,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.709
and within a split of a second he was to be finished.

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:56.834
And he just told his friend, "Think of Mother" - that's all.

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:01.959
And what he found, that he was nicely crawling on the road

00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:05.709
and the trucks were left behind, and the brake was working.

00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:11.625
But that emergency has to come.

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.917
Human beings are such that unless and until

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:18.041
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.125
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:26.834
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

00:08:26.834 --> 00:08:30.250
because if you are an ascetic then you are in a tight corner.

00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.375
They go to Gobi Desert to create that emergency within you,

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:35.959
so that you think of God.

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:41.041
But that's too late to go to the Gobi Desert.

00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:45.500
They create problems for them to get into tight corners,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.083
so that they can get out of it.

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:55.083
But for Sahaja yogis if they are wise, they need not have.

00:08:56.667 --> 00:09:02.000
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.417
Only way is meditation.

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:09.083
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:12.208
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.417
You may be all right for a while

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:18.125
for two, three months, maybe two years,

00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:20.875
but then you drop out.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.583
Many people think, "Oh, what's the need to meditate?

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:25.000
You see, it's all right.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.208
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:32.917
Because in meditation only you grow.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:36.208
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:39.792
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

00:09:39.792 --> 00:09:42.083
You just come up with a spring.

00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:46.083
But if you have to have continuous growth

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.208
then you must meditate,

00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:55.709
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.709
and then allow them to subside,

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.667
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:05.999
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:09.291
And you grow in your detachment

00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:12.917
to the cause of all the effects.

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:17.709
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:22.000
But this is the problem with us,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.083
is that we do not meditate, normally.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.291
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:35.250
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:39.125
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.083
but you don't grow.

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:48.542
Growth can only come if you meditate.

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:52.542
That is one very important part,

00:10:52.875 --> 00:11:01.208
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:04.999
In the normal life, how do we grow?

00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:07.792
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:10.333
We have to have sufficient oxygen,

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:12.125
we have to have sufficient food,

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:14.083
we have to have all these things.

00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:17.667
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:19.125
There's no way out.

00:11:19.125 --> 00:11:22.542
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.417
actually bumptious people,

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:29.458
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:32.999
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:33.208 --> 00:11:35.417
They can give big lectures, this, that,

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:38.083
but have no vibrations at all.

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:40.083
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:40.083 --> 00:11:41.291
they are not collective,

00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:43.667
they have no sense to be collective,

00:11:43.917 --> 00:11:45.250
all kinds of problems.

00:11:45.917 --> 00:11:51.999
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.

00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:55.333
That is one part of it.

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:59.333
That is, we can say, is the worship, is the puja.

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:05.667
Then you don't have to give up anything,

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:07.458
you just become detached,

00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:11.083
detached from the cause itself.

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:16.125
That's one part of it.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:20.834
Secondly, that this I would say will

00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:24.917
take you to the subtler side of your emotional bindings,

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:28.583
because emotional binding has given you

00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:30.000
certain identification:

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.417
you are a Christian or a Hindu or a Muslim,

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:37.083
or this and that, or a British or any kind of a race,

00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:39.250
or whatever you have to call it.

00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:41.542
All those things will drop out,

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:44.417
because you get a detached personality.

00:12:46.667 --> 00:12:49.250
So these emotional bindings - "he is my brother,"

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.917
"she is my sister," "I am worried about my wife,"

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:53.834
"I am worried about my child"

00:12:53.834 --> 00:12:56.125
- all these emotional bindings which

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:02.999
make you a smaller personality will drop out,

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:04.917
and you'll have one emotional binding,

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:09.792
is that "I am growing in my compassion.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.125
Compassion is active, my compassion is effective.

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:17.000
My compassion is alight.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.083
My compassion is this discretion.

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:25.709
I am a yogi."

00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:34.125
And secondly you read about Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:36.250
you know about Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:40.083
you know the technique of Sahaja yoga,

00:13:41.083 --> 00:13:42.834
you raise your kundalini,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.875
you clean your chakras,

00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:48.667
try to understand about mantras.

00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:51.000
You master your mantras,

00:13:51.834 --> 00:13:54.083
you master your deities,

00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:56.333
you please them.

00:13:56.834 --> 00:14:00.667
All these things when they are done properly,

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:04.583
then your mental bindings will drop out.

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:10.583
Those who think they are great scientists,

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.999
they will know that all this is no science;

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:16.709
the science of God's technique is much more.

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.959
Those who think that they are over-read,

00:14:18.959 --> 00:14:22.375
well-read people, when they read about Sahaja Yoga

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:25.375
and work it out on themselves and see for themselves,

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:27.208
and on others,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.417
they will know that whatever they have read is all stupid,

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:32.792
has no meaning, is empty.

00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:37.500
And that's how a kind of an emptiness will come in,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.999
emptiness of ego,

00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:45.375
because they'll see that knowledge is so great.

00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:49.083
Like Newton said that "Knowledge is like an ocean,

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:51.083
and I am like a little child

00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:54.750
collecting some pebbles at its shore."

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:58.166
What an understanding!

00:14:58.542 --> 00:15:01.500
So that emptiness comes in you,

00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:05.417
and then the real knowledge starts coming into you.

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:09.750
The identification with real knowledge comes.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.208
You talk;

00:15:11.208 --> 00:15:14.375
when you talk, that talk has an effect - that's a mantra.

00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:15.667
You just don't jabber,

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:17.208
"Oh, I am in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:19.500
I have been in Sahaja Yoga for fifteen years"

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.417
- good for nothing.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.625
You may be there

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:28.959
for a hundred years but you may remain a donkey as donkey is,

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.750
absolutely.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.875
But you may have been there only for one year,

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:40.417
and you may become from a donkey a human being,

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:42.166
and a yogi too.

00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:47.542
But that is what we have to first of all

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:49.792
recondition ourselves,

00:15:50.041 --> 00:15:55.750
by attaching ourselves emotionally to Mother.

00:15:56.959 --> 00:15:58.625
I mean, you have an advantage

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:04.875
over many other yogis of the world who came, poor things,

00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:07.041
they had nothing to look forward.

00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:10.500
They knew of a Primordial Mother, they knew about this,

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.999
but they had no Form.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.667
You have a Form.

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:19.375
You are very fortunate and lucky people; you have a Form.

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:23.959
It's easy to adore a Form than to adore something abstract

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:25.291
in the air, do you see;

00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:26.542
absolute consciousness,

00:16:26.542 --> 00:16:29.625
how do you adore it when you can't see it?

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:35.208
But that attachment doesn't mean in any way

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:38.333
that you have to give Me anything.

00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:39.625
What do you give Me?

00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:43.333
Nothing, but detachment from the cause.

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.792
And this works out - you have seen it in your lifetime.

00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:51.792
You also say that "It works out, Mother,

00:16:51.792 --> 00:16:53.250
somehow it worked out."

00:16:53.709 --> 00:16:54.917
What is bandhan?

00:16:54.917 --> 00:16:58.125
It's nothing but you are attaching yourself to your Mother,

00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:00.333
you're just telephoning to Her.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.959
This is a telephone going to your Mother,

00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:06.500
that's all.

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.583
You know I also play with you, I also say,

00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:11.000
"All right, I am giving you a bandhan."

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:14.583
I am giving bandhan to Myself!

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:16.208
It's a telephone call,

00:17:16.208 --> 00:17:18.083
just a telephone call.

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:20.834
But the faith has developed now that yes,

00:17:20.834 --> 00:17:22.834
this is the real faith,

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:27.458
where you get completely detached in your emotional things.

00:17:27.917 --> 00:17:30.667
It's just "My mother" - all right, just give her a bandhan,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.959
finished. "My father" - give him a bandhan.

00:17:32.959 --> 00:17:34.041
"My brother" - give him a bandhan,

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:35.625
whatever it is.

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:37.333
Bandhan, whatever it is.

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:41.208
You are putting that ... in the bonds of your Mother.

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:44.750
But you are not conscious that you are doing that.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.959
You are just binding them with the love of your Mother

00:17:46.959 --> 00:17:48.583
which is flowing through your hands.

00:17:50.959 --> 00:17:53.959
What are these vibrations, is your Mother's love.

00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:57.750
You've got it,

00:17:58.542 --> 00:17:59.625
it is flowing through you.

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:02.542
But what about your love for your Mother?

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.083
And that is what I find,

00:18:06.083 --> 00:18:09.875
that at the time when there is complete emergency

00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:16.542
that surrender comes in, and it works.

00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:21.959
So there's no need to create any emergencies.

00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:26.417
You must slow and steadily work it out,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.291
and it will build up by itself within you.

00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:34.041
You will have that power within you, I assure you.

00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:35.959
But meditation is one way;

00:18:35.959 --> 00:18:39.041
another is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:41.417
Not showing off, not telling others,

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:44.291
but working it out in yourself - different chakras,

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:45.542
how they work out,

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.166
on yourself, not on others.

00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:50.542
Once you start teaching others, it's a bhoot in you.

00:18:50.875 --> 00:18:53.999
You'd better learn it for yourself, even within yourself.

00:18:55.959 --> 00:18:59.834
I know who has mastered which chakra, which ....

00:19:00.041 --> 00:19:01.750
Nobody tell others that

00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:06.500
"this is the way to do it," that's absolute nonsensical ego.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.625
So such things should not be done.

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:14.166
If somebody asks you, you can tell

00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:19.500
individually, but on a large scale you do not give lectures

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:22.834
on that, and don't confuse people.

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:25.834
Now, so we have two things,

00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:29.083
that we have to get over our emotional

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:34.542
grossness and our mental grossness;

00:19:35.166 --> 00:19:37.625
same with our physical grossness.

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:42.166
Physical grossness can be overcome

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.417
if you surrender yourself,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.291
to one medicine, is vibrations.

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:56.542
Like Anupama, My grandchild, told her mother,

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:58.500
"You are born in allopathy,

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.625
then you are following homeopathy.

00:20:00.625 --> 00:20:02.999
Tomorrow you'll find out some jumbopathy,

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.250
then some numbopathy!

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.959
So, but I am born in God

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:13.625
and I follow only God's pathy,

00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:15.500
and God will look after me

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.834
and God will cure me."

00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:21.291
So My daughter said, "Why? You may also change."

00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:22.834
She said, "Why?

00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:25.417
Because God never changes."

00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:30.083
Simple answer: God will cure you.

00:20:30.709 --> 00:20:36.999
But you must have that much ascent to say that,

00:20:36.999 --> 00:20:40.375
as you just jump out at the time of emergency.

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.375
Same sort of an urge,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.542
that same sort of a personality should be within you

00:20:45.542 --> 00:20:47.959
to say that. Just if you say,

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.834
"Oh God, please save me,"

00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:54.166
God has no time for such people.

00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:57.999
You have no time for God, God has no time for you either

00:20:58.208 --> 00:20:59.999
- a simple thing.

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:04.166
So from sublime to mundane things when we come,

00:21:04.417 --> 00:21:06.417
we exist in both the things

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:08.083
and we are effective.

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:13.083
Whether we are in the lamp or in the light or in the oil,

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:16.375
we are at a subtler point;

00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:17.834
and we,

00:21:17.834 --> 00:21:21.625
if we give the effectiveness

00:21:22.041 --> 00:21:24.542
without being the cause.

00:21:24.834 --> 00:21:27.500
Because you are beyond the cause,

00:21:27.834 --> 00:21:31.667
so there is no need to create any cause for anything,

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.291
but you see the effect.

00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:39.542
So once the cause is finished effect is achieved,

00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:43.166
and it's achieved what is to be achieved,

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:45.500
the correctness of it.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.166
The correct thing you get.

00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:49.083
You do not get perverse thing,

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:52.291
but if you go with a cause then you can have perversity,

00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:54.417
you can have all kinds of problems.

00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:58.417
So the best thing is to detach yourself from causes

00:21:59.667 --> 00:22:01.208
and then you get the effect,

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:04.291
like as I told you that the brake got all right.

00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:05.458
The effect was there,

00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.917
the car was all right,

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:10.583
everything was fine so the effect was all right;

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:13.333
but the cause was lost.

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:14.458
There was no cause.

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.166
Why? How?

00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:20.208
How the thing was perfected?

00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:24.583
If you ask the effect of it, you say how did you get it?

00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:26.458
You can't explain, it didn't work out.

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.709
So because the cause is missing

00:22:28.709 --> 00:22:30.375
you cannot put it to any cause;

00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:33.583
you sometimes say it's divine the way it's worked out.

00:22:35.709 --> 00:22:42.250
So the only cause that is really effective is divinity.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.750
But the divinity should not be just as

00:22:50.959 --> 00:22:52.291
a mundane sort of a thing,

00:22:52.291 --> 00:22:55.041
"All right, yes, Mother's photograph is there, namaste.

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:58.750
Good. Namaste. Good morning, Mother" - finished.

00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:01.125
That's not the way.

00:23:01.125 --> 00:23:03.375
You have to know your Mother,

00:23:03.709 --> 00:23:06.375
and you have to love your Mother

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:08.500
- that is what it is.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.417
It's very embarrassing to say that you must love Me.

00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:17.291
But as a Mother in this lifetime

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.250
I have had many embarrassing things,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.750
and one of them is this,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.250
that I don't know how to tell the children.

00:23:24.709 --> 00:23:26.709
Now this is the fact.

00:23:26.959 --> 00:23:29.250
So you need not go through any emergencies

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:30.750
or any such problems.

00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:33.250
You just develop yourself in such a way

00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:39.375
that you are so developed that it just acts and works out.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:51.625
So I'll give you a example of that.

00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:53.375
It works the least in England,

00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:56.750
surprisingly, where I've worked the most

00:23:58.291 --> 00:23:59.750
- least in England.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.750
I'll give you a simple example, now.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.959
You see, your coming to India was decided

00:24:03.959 --> 00:24:05.583
I don't know how many months back.

00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:09.250
I have been to India once and I'm going second time,

00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:12.000
and England is the only place

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
where you have to pay your money directly.

00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:17.041
People have not yet paid,

00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:19.000
but Australians have done it.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:22.959
Australians, who are eighty, eighty-five people have done it,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.625
but English have not done - everything they are slow.

00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:28.166
But when it comes to ego they are the first,

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:29.959
their flags are the first.

00:24:29.959 --> 00:24:34.250
In the ego, where is it generated? - in England the great.

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:39.709
So when it comes to doing something they are the slowest,

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:41.959
when it comes to criticism they are the highest,

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.333
and then when it comes to the ego suddenly you'll see,

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:45.999
give them any position,

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:48.917
it's ....

00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:54.709
Why? Again you can explain, because there is a cause.

00:24:55.208 --> 00:24:56.709
You'll say it is inertia,

00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:01.792
blame someone, or it's a bhoot,

00:25:02.917 --> 00:25:07.000
or it's my ego or my superego, it's not myself.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.792
Myself, I am all right.

00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:10.834
Some cause.

00:25:11.458 --> 00:25:13.834
Why you have not paid so far?

00:25:14.083 --> 00:25:15.208
It's such a problem;

00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:16.917
I have to go now.

00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:21.208
If you were not coming you should not have come,

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:22.917
but if you are paying, you better pay for it.

00:25:22.917 --> 00:25:24.959
Now, what's the matter with you?

00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:27.375
They started with fifty people,

00:25:27.667 --> 00:25:29.375
now they end up with thirty-five.

00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:30.667
We have arranged for it,

00:25:30.667 --> 00:25:31.917
we have ordered for things and

00:25:31.917 --> 00:25:34.000
we have got the buses and all that;

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.542
now they are missing.

00:25:35.792 --> 00:25:37.250
Nobody asked you to come.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.792
On the contrary I was saying,

00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:42.250
"Keep it low. Keep it low, so that we'll make it nice."

00:25:42.542 --> 00:25:45.083
But you cannot have less than 350

00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:46.500
or you can have three hundred,

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.959
you can have two hundred,

00:25:47.959 --> 00:25:51.166
but you cannot just have 210.

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:52.792
Where to put them?

00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:55.375
A simple thing - see all the mundane style.

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:57.999
But in other places what they have done?

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:00.291
"All right, we have to go. Mother will work it out."

00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:01.083
It's worked out.

00:26:01.083 --> 00:26:03.999
Everybody has got money, everything done, it's all here.

00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:07.083
Americans have done it, surprisingly,

00:26:07.083 --> 00:26:08.792
but English

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.792
- they don't know whether they are going or not.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.500
Still there are some.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.542
Poor Gavin has to run up and down for all of you.

00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:23.500
I tell you, he is the one who has such patience.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.041
And I was amazed

00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:30.083
that there are still eleven people who have not paid,

00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:31.875
can you believe it?

00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:34.041
I mean, it's such a simple thing.

00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:35.667
If you don't want to go, don't go.

00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:36.959
If you want to go, you go.

00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:39.667
Tell him you are not going or you are going, finished.

00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:42.166
I mean, nobody wants you there.

00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:44.375
But even this little thing you cannot because

00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:46.667
you have a kind of a ...

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:50.041
because, because this has happened,

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:54.000
because that has happened, because ...

00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:00.458
So the English have to come up much more,

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:03.208
because I have really worked for you people very, very hard,

00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:06.458
and again God has given Me work again five years more;

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:08.125
I don't know what we are going to do.

00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:13.000
Sometimes I feel I should not be back, because no use.

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:17.625
This is a small example I am giving,

00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:19.834
very small example,

00:27:19.834 --> 00:27:21.125
it's very mundane type.

00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:24.125
You can see in other places also, like that.

00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:25.458
You tell them anything,

00:27:25.458 --> 00:27:28.583
"But why, Mother, it happens like that?

00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:30.375
Why do I do like this?"

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:34.709
I mean, asking Me a question, asking Me the cause!

00:27:34.709 --> 00:27:38.959
"Why did I behave like this? Why do I get into temper?"

00:27:41.125 --> 00:27:42.625
Like I have known people

00:27:42.625 --> 00:27:44.041
who have been coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:45.792
doing Sahaja Yoga and all that,

00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:50.208
but then they go to some other Steiner's place.

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:52.208
Then they go to some other courses.

00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:56.917
I mean, they have no faith in Me - Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:58.125 --> 00:28:01.250
They are practicing this, they are practicing that like mad,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.709
still going on.

00:28:02.709 --> 00:28:05.250
That's only possible in England, I tell you,

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.000
nowhere else - it's a speciality.

00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:11.709
I have known of so many people who came to Sahaja Yoga;

00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:13.917
without practicing Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:17.458
curing, helping them in Sahaja Yoga, working it out.

00:28:17.709 --> 00:28:19.667
They leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.041
They're going to this place, that place, that ....

00:28:23.917 --> 00:28:25.500
Is this the way?

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.625
Now I have known lots of people who

00:28:33.625 --> 00:28:35.959
try to blame the leadership.

00:28:35.959 --> 00:28:37.667
I am telling you all these things because

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:40.542
I was very sick when I came here, really I tell you,

00:28:40.542 --> 00:28:43.750
I was sick for eight days and I was sick even afterwards;

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.959
because you know, you are all in My body and I suffer,

00:28:46.959 --> 00:28:48.500
so I must tell you.

00:28:49.583 --> 00:28:51.166
And then they say the leadership is no good,

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:53.792
leader should be very strong, the leader should be this,

00:28:53.792 --> 00:28:56.333
and their leader must have a big thing in his hand,

00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:57.583
and they said if he hits us,

00:28:57.583 --> 00:29:00.000
we are not going to be all right.

00:29:00.375 --> 00:29:04.041
Again the cause; again the cause.

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:07.625
I tell you, you have one of the best leaders in Gavin,

00:29:07.959 --> 00:29:09.250
and I must tell you,

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.041
he is the man who spent a lot of money.

00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:14.625
Without telling Me he has covered many expenses,

00:29:14.917 --> 00:29:16.500
his office has worked for us.

00:29:16.834 --> 00:29:18.583
He took all nonsensical people.

00:29:18.834 --> 00:29:20.959
If I told him, "This fellow is getting some ego,"

00:29:21.166 --> 00:29:22.917
he'll employ in his office.

00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:24.625
If I say, "This fellow has got bhoots,"

00:29:24.917 --> 00:29:26.375
he'll employ in his office.

00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:29.333
He has worked with such bhoots

00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:32.000
that I could not manage them even for a day.

00:29:35.458 --> 00:29:39.333
He tries his level best to go to people and tell them that,

00:29:39.583 --> 00:29:40.458
"See now, come."

00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:42.625
He has saved so many people

00:29:42.917 --> 00:29:44.959
by his sense, by his understanding;

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:47.166
but the only thing is he, openly he doesn't lead,

00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:48.333
that's his mistake.

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:49.375
He should openly tell,

00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:52.375
"You are a bhoot and get cured, then you'll be all right."

00:29:52.875 --> 00:29:53.542
But if you say,

00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:55.542
"Come here. You see, you are a bhoot, doesn't matter.

00:29:55.542 --> 00:29:57.792
I have got lemons, ..., chillies. You sit down."

00:29:57.792 --> 00:29:58.792
Then, "Mother,

00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:01.625
he is identifying himself with the greatest bhoot."

00:30:04.208 --> 00:30:05.875
Let us face it.

00:30:07.917 --> 00:30:11.208
If you have understanding of your leader,

00:30:11.542 --> 00:30:15.166
then you should know that I know better than you know

00:30:16.083 --> 00:30:17.583
about it.

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:21.750
And this is very saddening sometimes.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.875
Why don't you understand the sheer goodness of a person?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.542
The amount of bhoots he has tolerated in his office,

00:30:28.542 --> 00:30:31.458
I tell you, I can't stand them for more than one day,

00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:32.959
some of them.

00:30:32.959 --> 00:30:35.667
So egoistical, some of them, off their heads,

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.458
and some of them are so bhootish

00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:40.709
that even if they come downstairs

00:30:40.709 --> 00:30:44.458
I get a pain in the stomach, in My house.

00:30:44.458 --> 00:30:46.583
But he stood them.

00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:49.333
Why? What was the need?

00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:52.500
Just that he thought that he'd help them.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.583
Whenever I told him that "This person is bhootish,"

00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:57.250
I find him employed by Mr Gavin Brown.

00:30:58.834 --> 00:31:01.375
Then one day I had to tell him, "Sack all of them,"

00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:03.500
and they were sacked.

00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:07.834
Why do we have the maximum number of bhoots in England,

00:31:07.834 --> 00:31:09.542
I can't understand.

00:31:09.917 --> 00:31:11.792
Is it necessary to have them around?

00:31:14.125 --> 00:31:17.000
On the day when I am going I should not tell you these things,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.250
but when I go away I find these bhoots come back,

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.917
and they become the causes, and the effects are shown.

00:31:26.208 --> 00:31:31.333
So I have to make a complete open picture to you

00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:35.333
to see that you can ascend to the highest of highest,

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:38.458
being born on this great land of this country.

00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:42.959
But you can also go very down, I have seen that.

00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:45.959
Because you're always blaming someone,

00:31:48.583 --> 00:31:49.458
last of all Gavin,

00:31:49.458 --> 00:31:52.709
and this is the worst thing that you have done.

00:31:52.709 --> 00:31:54.792
Let anybody say that to Gregoire -

00:31:54.792 --> 00:31:56.709
he'll chop that person off ten times

00:31:56.709 --> 00:31:59.750
and bring that person to me in chopped stages!

00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:03.125
Really, I mean!

00:32:03.917 --> 00:32:05.333
He'll say, "What nonsense!

00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:07.500
All right, it's ... go ahead."

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.750
You tell Mr.Warren,

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.709
I don't know what he'll do with all of the Australian type.

00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:16.917
They are all gems, no doubt.

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:20.375
But you deserve a man like Gavin.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.458
I thought, they are special people

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.917
that I've worked for you so much,

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:28.959
but I am amazed.

00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:33.458
The decent people don't need such leaders, do you?

00:32:34.709 --> 00:32:36.750
But the people who are decent now

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.500
turn out to be Australians, surprisingly,

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.834
the way they behave towards Me:

00:32:41.834 --> 00:32:44.125
so sweet they are, you'd be surprised,

00:32:44.125 --> 00:32:45.625
the children you know.

00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:49.208
Gavin, he bought some cups and saucers for Me

00:32:49.208 --> 00:32:52.458
because when I go there they thought they'll give Me tea

00:32:52.458 --> 00:32:54.208
in good cups and saucers.

00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:56.667
So he bought for all the centers one cup and saucer,

00:32:56.917 --> 00:32:57.917
good one.

00:32:57.917 --> 00:32:59.583
So the children, little, little children,

00:32:59.583 --> 00:33:00.750
they collected money;

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:04.333
after all, Mother will have a cake, also must have a plate.

00:33:04.583 --> 00:33:07.875
So they sent a check here, just see - how sweet!

00:33:09.083 --> 00:33:11.667
But I never eat cakes, you know that, but still

00:33:13.417 --> 00:33:17.000
- so sweet the children, I should say.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.917
What is the reason?

00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:24.917
Why do we dominate or get dominated?

00:33:24.917 --> 00:33:25.917
Why?

00:33:29.583 --> 00:33:32.166
Again the cause.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.750
Go beyond the cause.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:38.417
I bless you again and again that when I come next time,

00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:41.291
see that you don't make any mistakes anymore.

00:33:41.291 --> 00:33:43.291
Meditate and meditate and meditate,

00:33:43.291 --> 00:33:45.041
and when you come to India some of you,

00:33:45.041 --> 00:33:47.999
I would like to show you as my prize things

00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:50.291
from where I've worked, you know.

00:33:50.542 --> 00:33:52.083
Even where I've not been, you see,

00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:56.417
somebody else has given realization to someone in Nepal,

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:58.041
you see,

00:33:58.041 --> 00:33:59.834
and they are wonderful flowers;

00:33:59.834 --> 00:34:02.999
and here am I, something wrong with Me!

00:34:03.417 --> 00:34:05.250
Where I have worked,

00:34:07.166 --> 00:34:10.542
people are more worried about the causes.

00:34:10.834 --> 00:34:13.125
I have to really make a very, very

00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:17.041
straightforward appeal to you that now,

00:34:17.458 --> 00:34:19.458
grow within yourself.

00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:20.999
Are you magnanimous,

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.166
are you generous,

00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:23.750
are you systematic?

00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:25.834
Are you impressive,

00:34:25.834 --> 00:34:26.709
are you kind,

00:34:26.709 --> 00:34:28.375
are you collective?

00:34:29.375 --> 00:34:32.999
Are you attached to all these nonsensical things still?

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:34.875
Do you talk big,

00:34:34.875 --> 00:34:36.875
do you give big lectures?

00:34:38.041 --> 00:34:39.999
Humble down yourself,

00:34:40.625 --> 00:34:42.250
and then you'll see your greatness.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.667
Unless and until you put your head down to your heart,

00:34:44.917 --> 00:34:46.583
how will you see your Mother?

00:34:52.709 --> 00:34:54.917
I wish you all great luck now,

00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:59.250
and happy Christmas to you and happy New Year,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.500
and a very great New Year in spiritual growth.

00:35:02.792 --> 00:35:03.792
Let's show it.

00:35:03.792 --> 00:35:05.667
Let all of us decide today.

00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:08.250
Forget about your wives and husbands and children,

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:09.583
and this and that nonsense.

00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:14.000
Now you are yogis, you are united with Divine.

00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:16.208
Grow in it, prosper in it.

00:35:17.375 --> 00:35:19.250
May God bless you all.

00:35:33.959 --> 00:35:35.667
Now the today's program

00:35:35.917 --> 00:35:37.834
should not be very big because we are not allowed

00:35:37.834 --> 00:35:39.083
lot of time,

00:35:39.083 --> 00:35:42.917
but it's nice that today we could have a little puja of farewell.

00:35:42.917 --> 00:35:45.542
But it should be a very small ... because it is,

00:35:45.542 --> 00:35:48.250
how much you receive is the point,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.583
because before going I don't want to have all kinds of chakras,

00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:54.000
you see, going into spasms.

00:35:55.542 --> 00:35:58.250
I am sometimes afraid of a puja in England.

00:36:01.999 --> 00:36:06.333
Gavin, I think you can just ...

00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:16.208
It's the mastery.

00:36:16.208 --> 00:36:17.875
You must have the mastery,

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:19.417
upon yourself first of all.

00:36:19.417 --> 00:36:21.208
If you are not a master you cannot act

00:36:21.208 --> 00:36:24.083
- and upon your instrument, that's the point.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.917
And I would not like anybody to disrespect

00:36:33.917 --> 00:36:35.999
the leaders at all.

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:39.208
You may be very intelligent, that's outside Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:39.542 --> 00:36:41.750
In Sahaja Yoga you have to listen to your leaders

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:44.792
and respect, and nobody should try to find faults.

00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:47.999
I know his faults, what are his faults are,

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:50.083
and I know how to deal with them.

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.166
Everybody should try to strengthen.

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:57.291
Now I would say in Australia, which is a modern thing,

00:36:57.542 --> 00:37:02.542
I should say that the whole thing works like one body.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.999
Nobody questions Warren.

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:10.333
They telephone to him, they tell him, they collect money,

00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:13.875
they put the money - it's all working like one body.

00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:16.917
Here everybody is trying to cut the head

00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:18.250
- or attack the heart;

00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:27.667
that's your heart, that's your brain.

00:37:28.458 --> 00:37:33.000
So please remember all of you should offer services

00:37:33.667 --> 00:37:34.999
to Gavin,

00:37:35.208 --> 00:37:36.458
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:36.709 --> 00:37:38.750
before criticizing.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.500
Those who say the books are not arriving,

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.125
let them take over the books.

00:37:44.792 --> 00:37:51.709
Even booking My seats and all that he has to run, I know;

00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:55.792
whatever you may say about ... he used to do all this.

00:37:57.583 --> 00:38:01.333
So you should offer your services also,

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.709
to do these jobs.

00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:06.333
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out.

00:38:06.709 --> 00:38:08.917
We are not only here to take blessings

00:38:08.917 --> 00:38:11.375
but we have certain duties also,

00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:13.583
and that's what everybody should offer,

00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:17.667
their measure: what can I do, how can I help?

00:38:19.542 --> 00:38:22.125
What is the work? Let's see now.

00:38:24.458 --> 00:38:26.709
I hope in the next meeting you all should sit down

00:38:26.959 --> 00:38:28.917
and find out what you can do.

00:38:29.417 --> 00:38:32.792
A group can be formed: two, three persons can sit and do it

00:38:32.792 --> 00:38:35.333
with love, with attention,

00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:38.458
so that his burden will be reduced, and you will all feel

00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:40.709
the joy that you are doing something for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:40.999 --> 00:38:42.417
Mother has done so much for you,

00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:44.542
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:38:46.542 --> 00:38:48.083
You want to have nice ashrams,

00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:49.709
nice place to live there,

00:38:49.999 --> 00:38:51.333
all right.

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:53.792
You want to have comfortable places, cheaper places,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.083
all right.

00:38:55.417 --> 00:38:56.458
You want to have good health,

00:38:56.458 --> 00:38:57.417
all right.

00:38:57.417 --> 00:39:01.083
You want to have fine children, all right; enjoy your life.

00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:04.750
But what about giving,

00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:08.917
giving your heart,

00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:11.792
your respect?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.166
Next time when I come back,

00:39:16.458 --> 00:39:20.542
I want to see that you are all growing as one body.

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:22.999
At least the Heart should be integrated,

00:39:23.208 --> 00:39:24.667
if nothing else.

00:39:24.917 --> 00:39:26.166
Imagine a heart

00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:28.999
which has the valves which pulsates at various times,

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:34.333
all muscles going at different wavelengths.

00:39:35.083 --> 00:39:38.333
How can this universe survive with a heart like this?

00:39:40.542 --> 00:39:43.333
So I have to request all the,

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:47.333
all the cells of the Heart to be alert,

00:39:47.333 --> 00:39:49.917
to be one in unison with God,

00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:52.875
and in loving care of the whole universe.

00:39:54.542 --> 00:39:56.458
May God bless you.

00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:05.542
So what is this puja supposed to be today?

00:40:07.417 --> 00:40:09.458
It's farewell puja

00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:13.250
today, so let's have it,

00:40:13.583 --> 00:40:15.709
just before the birth of Christ.

00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:18.333
Let Christ be born within us.

00:40:18.583 --> 00:40:20.999
Let's be, like Him,

00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:24.709
the one who always insisted,

00:40:25.458 --> 00:40:28.125
"Love your brothers. Love your sisters."

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:30.000
Who are your brothers and sisters?

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:31.667
He asked the question too,

00:40:31.917 --> 00:40:34.583
"Who are My brothers and sisters?"

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:37.583
"Sahaja yogis are my brothers and sisters."

00:40:39.583 --> 00:40:41.291
Somebody offered at the altar.

00:40:41.291 --> 00:40:44.125
He said, "What are you to offer at the altar?

00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:46.625
Have you reconciled with your brother?"

00:40:46.917 --> 00:40:48.750
Have you reconciled?

00:40:49.166 --> 00:40:52.750
First reconcile, and then bring flowers to Mother.

00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:57.709
He said it already.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:02.917
Think of Him, how forgiving He was,

00:41:03.709 --> 00:41:06.834
how magnanimous, how great, and how

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.750
He thought of His Father all the time,

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.583
completely dedicated,

00:41:13.583 --> 00:41:15.291
doing His work.

00:41:18.166 --> 00:41:21.166
So with all praises to Christ

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.917
and to His Mother who worked

00:41:24.166 --> 00:41:26.166
in a very potential manner,

00:41:27.625 --> 00:41:30.583
we have to today within ourselves

00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:34.166
awaken that great Spirit,

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:37.583
which is actually the Aumkara.

00:41:41.959 --> 00:41:43.709
Even the memory,

00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:45.917
even the idea of that

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:48.834
is so joy-giving.

00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:53.166
Let His life be reflected in your lives.

00:41:54.125 --> 00:41:57.917
You have to be true Christians.

00:42:05.834 --> 00:42:08.083
Let's have ... what is it? ....

00:42:11.208 --> 00:42:16.834
I think ... Now I would say, next time when you come to puja,

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:18.542
all of you must have

00:42:18.792 --> 00:42:21.208
the hundred-and-eight names of the Goddess.

00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:23.583
You must have all the papers that are there.

00:42:23.834 --> 00:42:25.709
Like we have these books,

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.583
all of us must have these papers,

00:42:28.834 --> 00:42:30.999
not only one person should have.

00:42:31.375 --> 00:42:34.125
We should try to remember certain things also:

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:35.375
the names of the Goddess,

00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:37.208
the names that we recite.

00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:39.709
We should read them again and again and understand them,

00:42:39.709 --> 00:42:41.375
the Sanskrit meaning of it.

00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:45.250
And it should come to us very easily,

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.583
because that is how we are going to work out our chakras.

00:42:50.083 --> 00:42:53.000
I don't think we have names of Christ,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.291
it's all right,

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.417
and this time I hope we will try to

00:42:58.542 --> 00:43:00.542
read some names of Christ.

00:43:00.542 --> 00:43:03.999
But we have the names of Ganesha but not of Christ,

00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:07.917
so we'll say the hundred-and-eight names of Shri Ganesh,

00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:11.750
and somebody can wash My feet, all right ....

00:43:16.834 --> 00:43:17.875
Have you?

00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:20.375
Well really, that's the best.

00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:29.083
But so, I would say somebody should say now, let's see.

00:43:29.083 --> 00:43:30.500
How many names we have? ....

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.417
Let Me create the names, and we'll give it to others.

00:43:34.999 --> 00:43:37.959
Why should only Gavin keep the names?

00:43:45.542 --> 00:43:49.375
It's not like a prime minister of this country,

00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:51.166
you have chosen the leader.

00:43:51.166 --> 00:43:53.417
Prime minister is paid money for,

00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:58.041
she's - that's her job she is doing.

00:43:58.625 --> 00:44:00.625
He is not doing his job.

00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:05.750
You all are doing the job of God.

00:44:06.625 --> 00:44:09.166
So why should there be any such thing that ...

00:44:12.291 --> 00:44:14.083
Now somebody should read it,

00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:16.291
and somebody can.

00:44:23.917 --> 00:44:25.000
Now who will read it?

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.208
Now somebody should read it and somebody can wash My feet.

00:44:28.208 --> 00:44:29.917
But don't do it too much, eh?

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:34.000
This is Christ - it's not easy to absorb.

00:44:34.709 --> 00:44:36.458
All right, let's see.

00:44:36.834 --> 00:44:39.667
Let's see how much love you have for Him,

00:44:39.917 --> 00:44:42.000
how much you absorb Him ...

00:44:47.375 --> 00:44:47.959
Get up now.

00:44:48.166 --> 00:44:50.750
So you must get up to help, some of you.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.834
And others also.

00:44:56.834 --> 00:45:00.083
There's nothing to fear that there is ego or anything.

00:45:00.083 --> 00:45:01.999
Don't keep back thinking,

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:04.875
"Oh, they think I'm just being ... " -  no, run!

00:45:05.083 --> 00:45:06.625
Run for the job.

00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.166
Now, what is it?

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:14.542
Get some things what you need.

00:45:14.959 --> 00:45:17.542

in rituals - what makes you  think?

00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:12.375
The rituals which are real ...

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.083
See, the one who is riches,

00:51:19.333 --> 00:51:21.417
how can He be interested in riches?

00:51:23.166 --> 00:51:26.083
That's the point ...

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:27.999
Riches He is.

00:51:27.999 --> 00:51:30.999
Not interested at all, because He being the riches

00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:33.917
- that is gunatita, as you call it - you see,

00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.291
the being and the non-being.

00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:36.792
When you are the non-being,

00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:38.999
you cannot be interested in the being.

00:51:41.625 --> 00:51:43.542
Beyond, He is beyond.

00:51:49.333 --> 00:51:51.166
He is the  sacred heart.

00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:56.875
He wears a crown of thorns.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.917

He is angry with materialists.

00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:30.583
He destroys ego and absorbs superego.

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:34.750
He is the destroyer of desires.

00:53:35.417 --> 00:53:37.917
He is the pure power of desire.

00:53:40.542 --> 00:53:42.917
His church is the heart.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.291
He has the eleven destroying powers.

00:53:48.667 --> 00:53:50.583
He is the destroyer of false prophets.

00:53:51.333 --> 00:53:53.125
He is the destroyer of untruth.

00:53:53.875 --> 00:53:55.917
He is the destroyer of intolerance.

He is the destroyer of racialism.

00:53:59.875 --> 00:54:01.750
He is the destroyer of anger.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.875
Of fanaticism - it's very much so.

00:54:09.417 --> 00:54:11.458
He is the herald of the Golden Age.

00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:15.291
He is worshipped by our Mother.

00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:18.125
He is praised by our Mother.

00:54:18.917 --> 00:54:20.875
He is loved by our Mother.

00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:23.792
He is the one who is chosen.

00:54:25.667 --> 00:54:28.291
He is awakened in all Sahaja yogis.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.417
He who rides the white horse at the end of the age.

00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:37.458
He is the end of our fears.

00:54:39.291 --> 00:54:41.542
He guards the gate of our Mother.

00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:45.291
He is the only way to the Kingdom of God.

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:50.125
Aum Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahavishnu sakshat

00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:51.667
Shri Mahavirata sakshat

00:54:51.667 --> 00:54:53.917
Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

00:54:53.917 --> 00:54:56.875
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

00:57:51.542 --> 00:57:54.291
I think the word "worshipped" should be "adored by our Mother"

00:57:54.625 --> 00:57:55.917
because He didn't like it, I think,

00:57:55.917 --> 00:57:57.333
it's catching on the Agnya.

00:57:57.999 --> 00:57:59.792
So it's "is adored by."

00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:02.875
See, He's so particular - you see,

00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:05.792
the protocol is not all right, that's why.

00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:09.792
See - better!

00:58:09.792 --> 00:58:11.750
Agnya was fine. See?

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:13.750
Some catches there are.

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.458
I was wondering which one of them was.

00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:19.291
Now we'll say, "He is adored by our Mother."

00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:20.999
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:22.166 --> 00:58:23.333
Again, three times.

00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:25.041
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:25.792 --> 00:58:26.458
Again.

00:58:26.458 --> 00:58:27.999
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:30.792
He is adored by our Mother.

00:58:30.792 --> 00:58:34.500
See? He's very particular.

00:58:34.959 --> 00:58:37.041
May God bless you.

00:58:46.583 --> 00:58:47.333
You got the meaning of that?

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:14.750
The description of Mahalakshmi, what She gives you,

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:21.542
and also the description about Her relationship with Vishnu,

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:24.291
with Hari - is Shri Krishna,

01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:27.208
that She is the beloved of Shri Krishna (Hari)

01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:30.417
Is the beloved of Shri Krishna;

01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:33.208
and that's how it explains how Mahalakshmi,

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:36.750
if She is Mary, then Mary is Radha.

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.792
This has to be done by boys

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.542
who haven't got the feeling of marriage,

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:15.999
or think of it. It has to be that pure.
