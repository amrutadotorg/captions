00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:03.896
It’s nice today is Mother’s Day,

00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:08.854
and You find so many people waiting
for You.

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:13.083
And also You see Yourself as a Mother,

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.158
the heart which is pining to meet you,

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.566
then You can’t get out of some things.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:28.207
And then You enjoy that pining and
that longing

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:34.325
to see Your own, Your own children whom
You love so much.

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:38.067
It’s such a great joy;

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.790
in these modern times,

00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:53.622
it is described that in this Kali Yuga
everything will go upside down

00:00:53.823 --> 00:00:58.638
because people will not recognize
the motherhood.

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:03.867
The mothers won’t be respected

00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:08.870
and won’t be respectable either.
Is a fact.

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:16.422
And imagine now this has brought this
Mother’s Day to this country.

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:20.538
It’s something, such a recognition

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:27.292
from the Divine, that one has to

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:35.453
remember that motherhood is very important.

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:43.303
It is the Mother who created the universe;

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:47.585
the Father was just a witness
to the whole show.

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:51.344
It is She works it out the whole thing.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.039
It is She makes it beautiful so that
He sees

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.812
the show, that He becomes the spectator,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:08.083
because She loves Her creation.

00:02:08.423 --> 00:02:12.984
The Father wants that it should be such
that He should be able to love it.

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:19.595
He is a perfectionist, he wants everything
to be perfect.

00:02:19.796 --> 00:02:23.211
But a Mother accepts as the child is,

00:02:23.412 --> 00:02:26.421
because that is Her own creation.
If there is a defect in the child,

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:30.583
She accepts that defect as Her own

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.309
and She works for it; She works very hard.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.130
It’s no sacrifice, because you enjoy it.

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:50.132
You enjoy doing that. You enjoy working
for your children.

00:02:54.454 --> 00:03:00.964
And if it was not so, this world would
never have existed.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:07.067
You know what untold things mother has
to bear when the child is to be born.

00:03:07.268 --> 00:03:10.657
Actually, it is a test of her love,
I feel, at that time.

00:03:10.873 --> 00:03:16.677
Still she goes on with it because she wants
that child.

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:23.344
But when this motherhood is spoilt
in its image,

00:03:23.545 --> 00:03:28.858
when the mothers are no more mothers,
they are not respectable,

00:03:30.764 --> 00:03:36.550
then they are not respected. And when
the children don’t respect their mothers

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:42.341
because they have no respect for anything
else whatsoever…

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:46.743
I mean, the first thing and the last thing
is the respect for the mother.

00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:51.279
If one does not respect the mother,
or the motherhood,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.508
that means he has no respect for himself
either.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.464
So how does he exist? He exists through
his mother.

00:03:59.665 --> 00:04:05.261
So, mother is a very, very important
institution

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:09.323
for the whole creation, for your creation

00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:15.898
and for the creation of your children and
all the progeny that has to come.

00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:21.677
Now let us see what does the Mother
provide us with,

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:25.733
what part of our being She is.

00:04:27.468 --> 00:04:30.543
I would say that She is everything.

00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:35.113
But your personal mother who has given you
this birth,

00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:40.109
this body, is your own mother

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:45.694
whom you know very clearly that she is
your mother.

00:04:47.022 --> 00:04:50.557
As you know, she gives you

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:57.048
the nourishment when you are in a fetus
stage;

00:04:57.257 --> 00:05:01.688
and later on when you grow up she,
she gives you

00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:09.431
all the physical nourishment that is needed
for your growth and she enjoys it.

00:05:11.806 --> 00:05:15.441
Otherwise she feels over-burdened.
She wants to give it.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:19.096
And everyone appreciates that.

00:05:20.074 --> 00:05:24.353
It’s a collective enjoyment.

00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:34.511
And it’s going on, and it could be seen
from all the paintings of the world,

00:05:34.712 --> 00:05:42.099
all over the world, in every language,
in every country, every religion.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.284
The mother and the child has been
the main theme of paintings

00:05:47.486 --> 00:05:54.132
and expression of the most joyous moment
for painters.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.862
Poets also have written such a lot on that.

00:06:01.601 --> 00:06:07.525
Every way of manifestation of joy,

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:15.860
in all the human endeavor has been on this
thing, revolving on this thing.

00:06:17.338 --> 00:06:21.441
But the mother who is your own mother,
whom you know as your mother,

00:06:21.642 --> 00:06:30.567
who gives you physical birth, is the mother
who gives you much more than you know of.

00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:37.695
Because her blood has her vibrations,

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:51.058
and when she gives you her blood she gives
you her vibrations,

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.378
she gives her sustenance,

00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:07.607
she gives you her desires and also
she gives you

00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:13.422
a push in your evolution if she is
an evolved person.

00:07:23.358 --> 00:07:31.727
Now, in mother and the child relationship,
mother gives a lot.

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:39.442
She gives, makes your complete left side.
She creates all that left side in you,

00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:45.655
because she has desired for you; so
she creates that.

00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:54.227
On the right side she gives you
all the beauty of delicate things,

00:07:55.718 --> 00:08:05.857
and also the hunches that you get
in your business

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:12.942
or all the flexible moments of your life
that you think,

00:08:13.143 --> 00:08:19.231
“From where unknown I got something?” -
that’s your mother’s blessings on you.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:24.356
You choose your own mother, too,
when you are born.

00:08:24.556 --> 00:08:27.472
So no use just condemning your mother
because she’s like this,

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:29.995
she’s a horrid woman, and she’s this
and that and that.

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:33.920
Now, you have chosen her; so better
have it.

00:08:35.826 --> 00:08:39.960
And she is a very big part of you,
I must say.

00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:44.621
But she has to be also something to be
a mother.

00:08:44.822 --> 00:08:51.175
It’s a most responsible position is that
of a mother.

00:08:51.376 --> 00:09:01.481
It is even a - much more responsible than
that of a king has, to be a mother,

00:09:01.682 --> 00:09:13.391
because the king can only go up to material
level, or up to physical level.

00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:19.113
And up to rational level, at the most,
a philosopher can go.

00:09:19.647 --> 00:09:24.962
And the emotional level may be fulfilled
by the wife.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:31.833
All these things may be done by other
people,

00:09:32.034 --> 00:09:37.870
but spiritual level you can only achieve
from your mother’s grace.

00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:46.510
Any hampering you get in your spiritual
ascent could be

00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:53.648
from so many other problems, but basically
it could be from your mother’s side.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.019
So mother also can give you
her nervousness,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.653
she can give you her irritative nature,
she can give you her bad temper,

00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:08.109
she can give you a very cunning nature;

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:13.995
she can give you all that is bad in her,
just in a bundle.

00:10:17.774 --> 00:10:22.257
But you can also give her back something
special.

00:10:22.465 --> 00:10:30.989
Supposing a child which is a realized soul
is taking birth in a mother

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:39.635
and the, if the mother is not a realized
soul,

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:46.047
then the child will try to clear the Nabhi
of the mother

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.470
and give her lots of vomiting,

00:10:49.671 --> 00:10:52.958
by which she’ll clear out, or diarrhea
or something like that,

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:57.066
and try to clear the Nabhi and the Void
of the mother.

00:10:57.267 --> 00:11:02.087
If she has been going to some guru and
all that, the child will take full care

00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:10.547
to see that she gets rid of all the bad
things she has received from a bad guru.

00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:18.430
And tremendous things happen when a woman
conceives a realized soul.

00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:21.531
But even a non-realized soul, when a mother
conceives,

00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:26.376
her face just starts glowing because,
see, she is creating something.

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:31.274
Is a special blessings of God come
on her.

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:36.034
But as a Sahaja yogi, when you are reborn
as Sahaja yogi,

00:11:36.235 --> 00:11:39.291
you have your vibrations,

00:11:39.492 --> 00:11:48.777
then what you do is to give back to your
mother by giving her realization.

00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:55.865
Giving realization is an obligation which
cannot be repaid back.

00:11:56.074 --> 00:12:03.531
Every obligation of this world can be
repaid back

00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:10.764
and the last obligation, is the obligation
of mother giving you birth on this earth,

00:12:10.965 --> 00:12:17.938
can be also repaid back by giving her,
her own second birth.

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:25.654
You becoming the mother of your mother
is the best way you can repay her back.

00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:35.106
And so - though it is a difficult thing
under the circumstances as they are -

00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:39.995
I know you are all quite worried
about this.

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:44.945
Not easy, because due to war or whatever
it is,

00:12:45.146 --> 00:12:48.524
in the Western countries the mothers
have lost their position,

00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:52.371
they have lost their moorings, they have
lost their significance

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:57.589
and they think that they have not been
all right as mothers.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:04.219
They think they have not been very helpful
to the society by only by being mothers.

00:13:04.514 --> 00:13:08.224
But they can be brought round gradually
by showing

00:13:08.432 --> 00:13:13.006
that you are so significant yourself
and that they are the mothers.

00:13:13.207 --> 00:13:17.089
They are the mothers who have brought you
to this world.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.960
Once they start realizing that significance
within themselves,

00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:25.988
I'm sure it will work out. And that’s how
you are going to repay it back.

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:28.755
And once you have done it, you have done
the job.

00:13:28.956 --> 00:13:32.685
So you don’t have to worry about the other
things. You have repaid it.

00:13:32.886 --> 00:13:35.284
So be happy about it, those who have done
that,

00:13:35.485 --> 00:13:38.080
and those who have not done it will be
doing it.

00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:43.141
So on this day of Mother Day I would like
to bless you,

00:13:43.342 --> 00:13:49.941
that now you have to give birth to so many
thousands of people.

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:56.126
So the power that your Mother has,
of giving birth, the spiritual birth,

00:13:56.327 --> 00:14:00.204
be bestowed upon all of you so that you
do this work

00:14:00.405 --> 00:14:05.154
with the same grace and with the same
patience and love and enjoyment.

00:14:05.355 --> 00:14:08.227
May God bless you.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.381
Are you better now?

00:14:42.017 --> 00:14:45.277
So now, what is it?
