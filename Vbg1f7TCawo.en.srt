00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,533
Talk to Yogis in Rahuri

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,952
(India) 7 January 1983.

3
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:03,783
You have come here to learn

4
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:07,936
something, to go deep into your experiences

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,785
of the knowledge of your roots.

6
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:19,994
Shri Krishna has said that this is

7
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:23,737
a tree which is upside down, the

8
00:00:23,737 --> 00:00:27,725
roots are upwards and the

9
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,684
leaves are outwards.

10
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:33,434
In the same way, you

11
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:36,893
know that Kundalini really, when

12
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:40,619
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

13
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,884
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

14
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:49,277
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

15
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:53,271
understand that when we are now getting

16
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:56,325
subtler and subtler and trying to

17
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:58,887
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

18
00:00:58,887 --> 00:01:04,092
get out of materialistic attitude and

19
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:07,157
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

20
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:11,346
sticking point. I had met one

21
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:13,815
guru before, because you know I went

22
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:16,619
to all of them. And I asked one of

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,553
them, I said, why do you take money,

24
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:22,562
so much money from these people who

25
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,618
are western people? So much, why do you

26
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,780
take and just they become beggars, 
absolutely, like beggars they become

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,815
because you charge them so much and

28
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:36,608
so heavily??And he told me that unless

29
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,836
and until you make them beggars

30
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,365
they will never take to God. They are

31
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:44,456
too rich to be near God. I mean,

32
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:48,015
this explanation I just could not

33
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:51,275
understand, it was absurd, I could not

34
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:57,017
understand how can this explanation 
have any proper meaning that you should

35
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,009
make people beggars and 
then they be nearer to God.

36
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:02,326
I said, in India we have 
many beggars, do you think

37
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:06,206
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

38
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,456
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

39
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:10,839
stuck up with their money and you

40
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,176
must just make them absolutely without

41
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:17,448
any money, moneyless people.

42
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:25,241
So, I mean, of course to such a 
stupid person what can you talk?

43
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,871
What can you convince?

44
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:32,467
I couldn't say to him, then 
why are you taking the money?

45
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:37,532
Then he would have said, 
because I am detached.?

46
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:44,124
You see, anything one can say like that if you 
start like that you cannot just stop it.

47
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:50,066
But one has to understand that 
materialism has gone into our roots

48
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:55,598
and if we have to clear out our roots 
we must get out of materialism.

49
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,437
That's important, but that does not 
in any way mean that you torture your

50
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:01,648
body or anything, I dont mean that.

51
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,498
But what Iam saying, your attention.

52
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:09,491
[Shri Mataji addresses some 
children] you shouldn't do like that.

53
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:13,447
Always Natali you get up which you know is not 
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

54
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:15,899
Now even if there are so many 
childrens sitting down here.

55
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:19,033
Please sit down and dont 
disturb any more sit down.

56
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,300
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better.... 
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

57
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:43,114
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a 
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

58
00:03:43,140 --> 00:04:21,230
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and 
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

59
00:04:21,256 --> 00:05:37,737
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please 
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

60
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:43,658
So now, when we are 
dealing with our

61
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:49,071
roots we have to be in the center,

62
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:53,985
in the core. In the core mean we are

63
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:58,987
taking in, sucking in the feeling

64
00:05:58,987 --> 00:06:01,237
or you can say the?

65
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:08,792
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you 
say to that in English, is there any word?

66
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:13,057
Is there any word which makes 
awareness and feeling put together?

67
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:18,318
Is there Gavin?

68
00:06:18,318 --> 00:06:21,640
[answer: Experience]

69
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,157
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

70
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,910
experience into your awareness and feeling.

71
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,638
You have to get the experience 
into your awareness and feeling.

72
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:36,339
In Marathi it is a very simple word Jaaniiv

73
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,616
comes from the word ja.

74
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:44,076
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

75
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,729
Also ja has two meaning.

76
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:55,395
Ja means also dnyana, awareness, and 
also it means spontaneous zaaniiv.

77
00:06:55,395 --> 00:07:05,759
So you start sucking that within yourself, when 
you are not entangled into other things.

78
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,659
If your attention is entangled 
outside, you cannot enjoy.

79
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:14,948
So, to be lost into which is 
samaadhi you see, is the one where

80
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:19,523
your attention is completely 
drowned into the experience.

81
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:23,149
That iswhat we have to achieve.

82
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:27,938
So it is  not only materialism, also emotionalism,all kinds of isms.?

83
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:31,280
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

84
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,403
since the history of word started in this 
world I think and now the unholy thing that

85
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:44,155
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja 
Yoga-ism?

86
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:50,833
also could be the greatest word because now 
there has to be attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

87
00:07:50,833 --> 00:08:00,125
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain 
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

88
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:13,534
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or 
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

89
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:18,169
stepping in into the dissolution.

90
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:21,231
Very quick!

91
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:25,126
And once you very quickly

92
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:28,076
dissolve into it, the whole movement

93
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:29,918
of your body is quick but not jerky,

94
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:37,768
is smooth and quick, rhythmic, is musical,

95
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,934
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

96
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:44,010
but is musical, is as a rhythm about

97
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,973
it, is very gracious.

98
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:52,563
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

99
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:57,808
to you very easily if you dont allow

100
00:08:57,808 --> 00:09:05,135
your attention to be attacked by all these isms.?

101
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:06,664
There is no end to it,

102
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:10,914
I mean, if I have to write all of them I 
think we will have to need at least one book

103
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:16,999
to write all the ism's of the world, there 
is no end to it, which we have created.

104
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:21,306
Then the worst of all is now 
I think Sahaja Yoga-ism

105
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:28,553
in which first of all is 
the feeling of lethargy:

106
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:33,736
it will happen Sahaja, sit down. 
Mother will do everything for you.

107
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:36,955
The another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

108
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:40,725
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there,

109
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:48,879
in which people sahajayogi's get into tantrums, try 
to show off that they are great Sahajayogi's

110
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,807
they have reached the third stage 
or the seventh stage or whatever they may.

111
00:09:54,807 --> 00:10:00,555
Now it's good this example is a very 
good example, I wish you had taken up.

112
00:10:00,555 --> 00:10:06,996
But see the expression of the Indian,

113
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:09,480
the enamored expression, see, it

114
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,450
so genuine, they can't control the singing.

115
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:20,809
Now, see, it's like a ?I just dont know, but people 
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

116
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:24,235
It's so nonsensical I tell you, that either

117
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:26,395
they could be taken out all their money

118
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:31,752
or if they are to be told now for Puja, 
all of them are paying twenty-one

119
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:37,288
because they have to do this or this extra work, so 
they are charging twenty-one

120
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:41,102
and if you tell them for Puja they 
will even give them fifty-one.

121
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:49,304
But I have told some of you have even refused 
that I mean it's so shameful I tell you!

122
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:53,976
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

123
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:56,137
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

124
00:10:56,137 --> 00:11:03,783
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of 
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical,

125
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:12,719
is a feeling , is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

126
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:16,323
It's a problem. Materialism 
it's complete materialism.

127
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:24,420
Those who have been, say, doing 
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

128
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:33,192
we have seen the cases like you see the Jains 
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

129
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:39,046
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people,

130
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:44,694
they build some temples also and sometimes 
they give to poor people also and

131
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:48,683
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna 
who are begging in India.

132
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:53,018
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

133
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:57,373
They are more compassionate to 
chickens than to human beings.

134
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:59,862
We have that kind.

135
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:06,771
At the same time I have seen in the 
West also such materialistic people,

136
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:13,741
I mean, they have no shame. 
So when you just turn and

137
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:20,348
see that, should abhor that, 
abhor, it's shameful!

138
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,676
How could you be like that even 
in Sahaja Yoga?

139
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:29,264
So as I have told you, there are 
some people who are materialistic,

140
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:35,936
some people who are emotionalistic 
and some people who are egoistic.

141
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:41,242
Now leave all these things on the 
sides, then you come in the center.

142
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:44,284
Now you are in the center.

143
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:52,148
In the center, people enjoy just the love 
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

144
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:59,993
Just think how your Mother loves you, finished! 
Can you? This very sweet feeling

145
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:03,309
And who is your Mother if you 
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

146
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:09,729
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem. 
No more thinking.

147
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:12,260
Just think how much your Mother loves

148
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:20,776
that means you are jumping onto My Kundalini 
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

149
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:27,164
then there is no thought, 
you cannot think.

150
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:35,283
When you think that how much your Mother loves 
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini and

151
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:38,577
that time there is no thought.

152
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:41,916
It is very simple to 
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

153
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,656
because you have somebody in person.

154
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:47,968
They never had somebody in person.

155
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,429
So I can understand their problems,

156
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,646
there was nobody in person;

157
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:56,361
they had to do it in the air.

158
00:13:56,361 --> 00:14:02,746
But here a sure shot thing: 
you can feel your vibrations

159
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:13,094
you can feel My love and you 
can feel your own quality.

160
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:19,577
It's very simple.

161
00:14:19,577 --> 00:14:27,731
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

162
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:31,195
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me, 
She will do everything for me,

163
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:36,115
She is going to do 
everything.

164
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:41,691
It's the love that other loves me so much, 
what can I do for Her?

165
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:47,425
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

166
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:50,224
What does She need? She needs nothing.

167
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:57,107
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything. 
What can I give Her?

168
00:14:57,107 --> 00:14:59,703
Which is the best flower

169
00:14:59,703 --> 00:15:07,875
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji

170
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:12,778
and He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

171
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:22,532
He was breaking one by one all of those 
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

172
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:26,240
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

173
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,744
He said, I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram.?

174
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:40,104
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking 
them to find out, otherwise why should I wear it?

175
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:43,377
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

176
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:50,780
He opened His chest. He said, 
see in My chest. He exists there.

177
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,014
So it is never one sided sort 
of a thing, it is a thing that

178
00:15:56,014 --> 00:16:00,352
exists within you and you feel that 
and then has to be reciprocal.

179
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:13,080
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes 
to the shores and then it returns back.

180
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:22,001
So with this force only, I tell you, you 
can conquer your ego and super ego.

181
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:28,090
There is no way out.

182
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,956
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

183
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:39,217
know their Mother's love.

184
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:44,181
I know there has been an attack on that point and

185
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,297
the mothers have been funny there.

186
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:51,313
But doesn't matter, when you see 
something just put yourself to it.

187
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:56,269
To feel your roots.

188
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:01,369
These are your roots, and then you see the enjoyment.

189
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:04,916
The Mother Earth Herself 
is sucking you now.

190
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:11,733
She is sucking you down.

191
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:14,182
That is how you meditate now.

192
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:19,992
This is how you have to meditate, and it's 
such a security giving thing.

193
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:24,084
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

194
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:36,291
And that enamored expression that you find in these 
people will be on your face very soon

195
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:45,221
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini,

196
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:57,294
but not through your mental projections, but 
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

197
00:17:57,294 --> 00:18:00,984
It's very joy giving.

198
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:03,833
Just feel the joy of that.

199
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:12,097
You are all with Me here and the joy of that 
feeling will really enlarge your hearts

200
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:17,825
and then, then you can give it to others.

201
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:21,321
You don't have to be crazy about these things

202
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:29,793
but just to feel it within yourself.

203
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:35,942
All right, now I move on to Indians because

204
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:40,048
they are different style of people.

205
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:44,703
May God bless you!

206
00:18:44,703 --> 00:18:46,914
(Marathi talk)

207
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,880
Now, I was telling them, I must

208
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,305
translate it to you in English is the 
most important point

209
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:49,880
I was telling that now you are transformed, 
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

210
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,799
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

211
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,141
but, now what should happen to you? 
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

212
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:04,381
How it has happened that now you 
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

213
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:10,993
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same 
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

214
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:18,846
Now you have become a Ganesha, 
and from this Ganesha stage,

215
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:28,230
which you think you are a Ganesha now, 
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

216
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,770
if you have to sit on that throne 
as a king, then what should happen?

217
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:39,043
Actually, that now your Kundalini should 
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

218
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:44,134
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's 
Kundalini is in the stomach.

219
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:47,397
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

220
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:53,983
Means all your seeking has been 
so far in materialism,

221
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:59,687
has been in other things like in money, or in

222
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:04,085
power or in love or whatever it was.

223
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:09,416
But now your Kundalini itself 
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

224
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:14,308
your seeking is nothing but 
itself has become the Kundalini.

225
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:20,635
Your seeking has become the Kundalini, 
means that you are the giver,

226
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:24,546
now you are the Guru, you have 
now become the Guru.

227
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:30,507
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi 
that means now you are the Guru,

228
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:36,867
now you have to give all the 
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

229
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:39,406
Now you all have become Gurus.

230
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:42,476
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

231
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:48,422
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum 
to the stomach,

232
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:53,837
and this stage, unless and until it has 
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

233
00:33:53,837 --> 00:33:57,104
Once that has happened you 
become a Guru and then

234
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:03,168
you can really impress 
people and work it out.

235
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,388
It has to be done very fast.

236
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:09,140
It has to work out very fast 
and for that, first of all,

237
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,595
please get rid of your 
entanglements which are stupid.

238
00:34:12,595 --> 00:34:16,451
If you really believe that you 
have to progress in your seeking,

239
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:21,382
that you have to have your Kundalini 
coming up from your Nabhi,

240
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:29,181
then please, please hurry up, please try to 
work out, otherwise you are very few who

241
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:38,059
have been given also the privilege of 
doing My Puja, very few.

242
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,322
And those who have been given have a chance

243
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:44,334
to develop to that stage, and 
once you become that, all

244
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:49,898
of you who have achieved that 
stage can become the Gurus.

245
00:34:49,898 --> 00:34:53,533
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

246
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:56,742
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

247
00:34:56,742 --> 00:35:02,410
and like Shri Ganesha has His 
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

248
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,532
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

249
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:10,073
and that He doesn't have to worship 
anybody else but His Mother.

250
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:15,237
And He has to have all the 
powers which are granted by Her.

251
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:21,115
His powers, no one, even Brahma, 
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

252
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:23,035
They cannot reach Ganesha;

253
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:26,820
They cannot reach His stage because 
They are one-sided but

254
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,790
Shri Ganesha has all the powers, 
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

255
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,761
So to become like that, to be like 
that,He should be your ideal:

256
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:41,459
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice 
anything for the sake of Mother.

257
00:35:41,459 --> 00:35:48,025
Here there are people who don't even 
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

258
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:52,419
which you may just spend away 
somewhere in nonsensical things,

259
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:56,500
because your attention has to 
be brought round completely.

260
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,722
It has to be completely severed from 
all these nonsensical entanglements

261
00:36:02,722 --> 00:36:07,179
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

262
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:11,309
Then only it's going to work out.

263
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:19,951
It's a good pleasure and a great 
thing to be here in this holy land,

264
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:23,416
it's a very holy place 
you can see it, so peaceful.

265
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,342
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

266
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:29,960
is within every human being and after

267
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,924
that you have to know that this

268
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:35,843
peace that you are achieving 
has to be given to others.

269
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:41,278
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized, 
whatever you have got from the nature,

270
00:36:41,278 --> 00:36:43,895
you can release it back.

271
00:36:43,895 --> 00:36:49,085
For example if you give vibrations 
to a plant you can make it grow.

272
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:54,860
If you give vibrations to a flower 
you can make it sustain its life.

273
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,107
For the first time you are giving 
something to the nature,

274
00:36:58,107 --> 00:37:01,883
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

275
00:37:01,883 --> 00:37:04,778
Guru then you can give the peace

276
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:12,038
that is in the nature, you can give the 
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

277
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:15,305
But first achieve it within yourself.

278
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:21,893
Make this go inside you and see 
that bliss settle down within you.

279
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:25,562
You don't see other nonsensical 
things which are very disturbing

280
00:37:25,562 --> 00:37:27,653
sometimes to your western mind.

281
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:34,817
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the 
bathroom is not this.

282
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:41,187
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but 
feel the peace outside,

283
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:50,315
try to establish that peace within because 
this peace you have to give to others.

284
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:54,443
The whole development plan 
that I have is very fast

285
00:37:54,443 --> 00:37:57,222
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

286
00:37:57,222 --> 00:37:58,293
So may God bless you!

287
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:05,200
When you sit down just feel the peace and 
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

288
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,122
Don't pay attention to nonsensical 
things and this with this your little

289
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:14,911
brain trying to criticize, but try to 
achieve the peace within yourself so

290
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:18,289
that you can give peace to others.

291
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:24,445
It's not proper that some of you are looking after 
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

292
00:38:24,445 --> 00:38:26,310
You don't have to look 
after the negative people.

293
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,933
Just leave them alone.

294
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:32,386
Keep out of that because negative 
people can always bring you down.

295
00:38:32,386 --> 00:38:37,277
Don't try to improve the conditions of the 
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

296
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:43,190
Once you have achieved that state 
then we can arrange for them to come.

297
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:47,234
For example, if My car has failed, all 
right, I got into another car, which

298
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,806
was all right because I have to come to the program.

299
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:53,228
Then I can send the tempo 
from here to get that another

300
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:58,033
car where there were some people who 
were not supposed to be at the program.

301
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:02,152
That's how you have to be quick and 
not bother your heads too much

302
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:06,489
about the negative people who are sick 
people, trying to be compassionate.

303
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:07,474
There is no need.

304
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:08,987
Tell them, tell Mother.

305
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,481
Let you talk to Mother.

306
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,019
Look after yourselves and 
don't be bothered about them.

307
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,318
This is another nonsensical 
idea of compassion you have got.

308
00:39:17,318 --> 00:39:20,373
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

309
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:23,145
the compassion that works, that flows.

310
00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:27,117
It's all mental you see for us 
compassion is mental, every idea,

311
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:32,712
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God 
is mental, everything is mental for us.

312
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:39,381
He is not. He is the one that 
resides in the heart as Spirit.

313
00:39:39,381 --> 00:39:41,979
He is the one who works 
through the compassion.

314
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:48,101
And now you know My compassion is 
that it flows, it works, it acts.

315
00:39:48,101 --> 00:39:53,019
It's not mental.

316
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:58,596
So don't try to be mentally concerned 
with people and try to be compassionate.

317
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,569
All right?

318
00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:04,065
I hope you understand that the 
compassion is not a mental idea

319
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:08,537
that we are compassionate, we are working 
for the unity of the world.And all that.

320
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:14,084
Even unity and all those ideas, even 
the idea of collective understanding

321
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:18,549
is in the heart, it should work.

322
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,093
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

323
00:40:22,093 --> 00:40:25,296
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

324
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:28,187
is embodied with the working capacity,

325
00:40:28,187 --> 00:40:31,038
embodied with the working out capacity

326
00:40:31,038 --> 00:40:34,074
actually working out capacity 
you can translate like that.

327
00:40:34,074 --> 00:40:35,114
It should work.

328
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:39,466
If it does not work out then what's the use 
of looking after somebody who is sick?

329
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:44,315
all right, come along This is 
nonsense, this is very mental.

330
00:40:44,315 --> 00:40:52,559
Just don't waste your energy; you have 
not come here to look after the sick.

331
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:59,590
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the 
sick and being very

332
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,855
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

333
00:41:02,855 --> 00:41:06,724
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

334
00:41:06,724 --> 00:41:11,320
Another superego-oriented that we 
are sacrificing this and that and

335
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:16,386
we are becoming beggars in India like the 
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

336
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:19,925
Both are just the same, now 
please don't do all these things

337
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:29,442
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

338
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:32,856
that you have to ascend faster.

339
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:39,269
You have to individually ascend faster 
and collectively pull out everyone

340
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:43,997
but not those who are heavily 
laden with problems and

341
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:47,403
who are creating problems and 
objecting your progress.

342
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:51,236
That doesn't mean that you are 
not compassionate.

343
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:57,370
You know how much compassion that I have but 
My compassion doesn't make stories,

344
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,431
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

345
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:05,702
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much 
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

346
00:42:05,702 --> 00:42:08,212
You have come here for a training,

347
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:16,561
a training into the understanding 
of awareness which is compassion.

348
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:20,792
You all have to, even, when you go to the 
school, you are not bothered about a person

349
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:24,449
who is lacking in the 
class, do you?

350
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,207
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

351
00:42:27,207 --> 00:42:30,660
In the same way, I would 
request you not to bother your

352
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,673
heads too much about people who 
are trying to pull you down

353
00:42:34,673 --> 00:42:37,599
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

354
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,831
That's My compassion for them and for you.

355
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:46,751
Let Me look after them and you just 
don't worry your heads about them.

356
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:49,814
They will be all right.

357
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:50,970
So, may God bless you!

358
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:58,040
Lets have a puja today, and 
this puja will be simple today.

359
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,701
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and 
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

360
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:16,955
and then we will have a good havan. 
That is a good place for havan.
