1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:09,320
That, the central one is the sustaining power
means is the power by which we evolve, that

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,309
means we get our sustenance as it is.

3
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:19,870
This sustenance that we have got as a human
being when it is to be manifested on the five

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:28,340
elements that we have within ourselves, the
source is there but we have to reach it through

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,890
its different elements.

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:41,320
When this interchange takes place or, we can
say, when we have to put this force outside,

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,460
that is to be done through establishment of
Dharma on these.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,750
Like a superimposition or, you can say, the
connection.

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,550
Like you can say, say there is sun.

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:07,680
Sun is the source of light and the source
of light has (to?) come to this earth which

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,680
is created out of the five elements.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:21,861
So the sun’s rays have to come, but when
they come inside, in this move, what do they

13
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:24,250
do?

14
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,400
They enlighten this world.

15
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,030
But it’s only possible if there is Dharma,
means the light is there, the rays are there.

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,350
The rays can be obstructed by many things.

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:46,440
If the rays are obstructed, then there is
a-dharma.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:55,970
So the source of Dharma, the spreading of
Dharma and ultimately the manifestation onto

19
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,229
the five elements is a complete thing that
is Void.

20
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,479
This play goes on within us.

21
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,039
Our evolutionary power which has worked from
the very beginning, from matter state, when

22
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,870
the matter got itself as organized then we
had carbon as tetravalent, then from carbon,

23
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,810
the life started – all this is the work
of the sustaining force.

24
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,630
Then we became human beings.

25
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:36,040
Now we have got ten dharmas within us which
we have to keep alright.

26
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,300
These are the main ten commandments.

27
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,840
These ten commandments we have to look after.

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:03:05,819
And these are looked after by the people who
are the primordial masters, as you call them

29
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:16,620
“incarnations”…(a noise covers the voice)
like Raja Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates,

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:25,470
like Nanaka, the last one was the Shirdi Sai
Nath.

31
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:38,450
This is the principle is there, is the primordial
master.

32
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:55,510
Now, there is another principle that is in
there by which you receive it.

33
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:13,840
This is called as the disciple principle,
the primordial disciple principle, represented

34
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:25,680
by the moon and the sun, presided by Buddha
and Mahavira.

35
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:39,460
So, this disciple element if it is not in
you, you cannot receive it.

36
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:59,129
But when you start getting – receiving it,
this Dharma gets into you and then you become

37
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,129
the guru.

38
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:08,729
You become the guru when this is completely
sustained in you.

39
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:17,150
It starts as a disciple and then ends up as
a Guru.

40
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,240
This is the Void part within us.

41
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:37,120
First of all, as the human beings are, we
do not observe the first ten basic principles.

42
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:49,759
In this country for example, or in the West,
we have – we observe the five of them because

43
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,580
of laws.

44
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:05,189
In the countries like India, they observe
the rest five, because of their society.

45
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:11,490
So in any way we are lacking some of them.

46
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,159
Five are missing here or five are missing
there.

47
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:34,319
This is the situation of the Dharma today.

48
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:48,129
The Gurus and their disciples they do this
connection and then the matter, which is created

49
00:06:48,129 --> 00:07:00,050
out of five elements, get vibrated.

50
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,259
You can enlighten the matter.

51
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:22,219
When the Dharma is complete you can enlighten
the matter.

52
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:41,870
The rituals that these people used which was
called as you see, do Dharmik rituals, they

53
00:07:41,870 --> 00:08:04,680
call them do dharmik, these are the deeds
of Dharma, is to worship, to do Puja and to

54
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:14,469
pray to God and to do all these things, prayer.

55
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:28,610
All these things after some time became absolutely
deadened because there was no realized soul

56
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:38,029
as a Guru and no realized soul as a disciple.

57
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:47,740
So it was just a joke going on, you see.

58
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,959
It has no meaning.

59
00:08:51,959 --> 00:09:06,260
Supposing I tell somebody who is not realized
to give himself a bandhan, he cannot.

60
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,819
[Aside: “He is coming back, don’t you
worry!

61
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:19,120
Both of them have run away.

62
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,329
He’ll agree then somehow.

63
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:31,649
The sister is realized, the wife is realized.

64
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,019
Born.

65
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:40,440
But the husband is like that, what to do?

66
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,570
He came…

67
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,759
Yogi: He came.

68
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,949
Shri Mataji: Eh?

69
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:52,149
He came in.

70
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:54,269
(Yogis: “Came”.)

71
00:09:54,269 --> 00:10:07,050
Came, ran away half-way, he still cannot decide
which way to go.

72
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,300
(A yogi says something)

73
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,320
Shri Mataji: He is alright.

74
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,009
Should be alright.

75
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,930
Yogi: I’m wondering where he’s gone.

76
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,850
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?

77
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:36,220
Yogi: I would like to know whether he’ll
come.

78
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,860
(Indistinct words)

79
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:46,870
Shri Mataji (laughs): So you will see gradually
how it works.]

80
00:10:46,870 --> 00:11:02,279
So this Void is so important because that
is how you establish your receiving ends in

81
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:12,279
your being, the five elements within you.

82
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:24,660
Meaning the five elements that exist (within
you?

83
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,139
– Not clearly audible).

84
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:40,650
In Sahaja Yoga, we try the other way round
stuff.

85
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,029
Yes, I have tried it this (way?).

86
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,390
Now, what to do?

87
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,310
The Dharma is all ruined.

88
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,860
It is.

89
00:11:49,860 --> 00:12:16,920
There is another way: all these elements are
represented in your chakras, different chakras.

90
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,920
So why not take the Kundalini through these
chakras and enlighten the elements themselves?

91
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,730
Even there is no Dharma in a person you can
do it.

92
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:38,949
But then the Kundalini goes back to all the
places which you have missed.

93
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:57,470
But if you have been to some guru and you
have bent your head before him, then the Kundalini

94
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:05,389
stops at that Void.

95
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:16,990
It doesn’t move, it goes here, and there,
and there.

96
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:29,730
It just stops, it doesn’t go further, it’s
very difficult.

97
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:39,680
You have seen the Void pulsating so badly.

98
00:13:39,680 --> 00:14:01,339
It just doesn’t rise, it always goes back
into that bottomless pit as you can call it.

99
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:12,149
It’s always sucked into that again and again
if you have had a guru.

100
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:27,809
So we try to remove the guru from your mind
by so many ways.

101
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:42,029
Deny them completely, absolutely, so that
they get out of your minds.

102
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:52,889
And again raise the Kundalini, and from the
innermost, the Brahma Nadi as they call it,

103
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,439
the innermost Nadi, the Sukshma Nadi.

104
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:03,120
Otherwise, you cannot reach there.

105
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:28,439
From outside you go on cleansing, cleansing,
cleansing until you reach there, you find

106
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:33,680
you cannot pierce through.

107
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:50,300
But outside cleaning helps you in one way,
that the Brahma Nadi becomes wider, the Nadi

108
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:58,699
that is in the center of Sushumna.

109
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:10,680
If you – there’s less pressure then it
is a wider one so for Kundalini rising there

110
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,570
is a better chance.

111
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,050
But in Sahaja Yoga, the subtlest of subtlest
Kundalini we catch, and thread it microscopically

112
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:24,079
inside, and take it out.

113
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:38,869
And by taking it out what happens, these chakras
definitely get enlightened, they expand.

114
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:43,839
That’s how we expand the Sushumna.

115
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,839
Expanding Brahmanadi.

116
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,999
This was – this is the trick of Sahaja Yoga.

117
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:57,600
Because this cleansing is going to take too
much time as you said.

118
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:18,159
The whole thing is to be cleansed out and
then it is to be released and then you have

119
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:23,209
to meet some guru who has to take it.

120
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:30,659
So the Sadhachar [virtue, correct action],
whatever Buddha has said, the right, the right

121
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:38,860
action, the right that he has said it, is
the one that is Dharma.

122
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,230
That’s what is described.

123
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:50,419
But that doesn’t work out with human beings,
it’s meant for people who are realized souls.

124
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:57,630
Most of these religions are meant for realized
souls, you can find out.

125
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,060
Actually realized souls only took to religion
before.

126
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:10,520
Those who were born again, Dwijah, Brahmins,
who took to religion.

127
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:22,740
But the time has come for people who are not
realized also to take to religion and to receive

128
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,120
His blessings.

129
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:35,559
Sahaja Yoga is the only way one can do it
– is to take it in the subtle-most – innermost

130
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:46,289
Nadi, enlightened every chakra, increase the
size of the chakra, pierce a little bit here,

131
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:56,000
then again raise the another thread, then
again the third thread, like that, go on expanding.

132
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,160
[Aside: “This is it, you are alright.

133
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Good.

134
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,260
Good, that’s it…”]

135
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,029
This is how it works out.

136
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:17,471
In her case I did the same, I was just talking
to you.

137
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:25,820
Now the main thing about Void one has to remember:
there is no rationality.

138
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:36,990
It’s the hunger inside the stomach, and
hunger has no rationality: if it is hungry

139
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,670
it will eat.

140
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:51,520
It has to eat, no rationality can satisfy
it: if you are hungry you are a bhakta (seeker).

141
00:19:51,520 --> 00:20:01,520
And when you have spiritual hunger, the same
hunger becomes subtler and subtler, ultimately

142
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
it becomes a spiritual hunger.

143
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,080
First, the hunger starts of, say, food, of
primitive things.

144
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:22,309
Then hunger for sex life, hunger for women,
hunger for men, then for power, then for money.

145
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:29,010
Then the hunger for spirituality starts.

146
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:40,090
When that hunger is concentrated and starts
rising without any rationality about it: you

147
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,860
don’t know why you are seeking.

148
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:53,430
Like Buddha: he had everything, he had a wife
and his father had provided him with everything.

149
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,200
Still, his heart was seeking.

150
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,080
Why was he seeking?

151
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,470
It’s the hunger that is not rationality,
that isn’t explained.

152
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:19,049
And then this hunger starts and the way we
quench that hunger is Dharma.

153
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:24,010
The way we keep it intact is the Dharma.

154
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:30,580
Supposing you are hungry: you go and eat some
poison: then it is a-dharma.

155
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,630
I know you are hungry, but you have to eat
proper food.

156
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,169
The knowledge about that is Dharma: what food
you must eat, what books you must read, what

157
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:49,740
people you must meet, how you should live,
what should be your attitude towards others,

158
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,570
others’ things, others’ wives, children,
daughters.

159
00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:15,550
Everything related to the other, all that
knowledge is Dharma.

160
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,659
But it has no rationality.

161
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:28,370
Like, you see, a man ran away, say, with somebody’s
daughter, he would say: «What’s wrong?»

162
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,370
I cannot answer it.

163
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,370
I cannot answer it.

164
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,370
If a man has bad relations, say, with his
own mother.

165
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,570
He says: «What’s wrong in this?».

166
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,260
You cannot answer, there’s no rationality.

167
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,320
It is so, it’s a fact: «Thou shall not
commit adultery.»

168
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,630
Christ has said even to have adulterous eyes
is wrong.

169
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:48,580
But at the time, it was Christ who came in.

170
00:22:48,580 --> 00:23:00,140
At the Moses’ time people did not know this
eyes business, but Christ could see that and

171
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,789
He had said it, that: «Those who have even
adulterous eyes are committing a sin.»

172
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:07,880
So, how to deal with the others?

173
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:23,799
Say, materialism now: we are so attached to
matter, is also problem of the Nabhi.

174
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:34,230
Materialism is a false identification with
matter, all falsehood – with matter, with

175
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:46,490
human beings, with books, with all that is
created, is the problem of Nabhi, so you can

176
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,490
understand how important is Nabhi.

177
00:23:51,490 --> 00:24:00,820
And the one that prescribes it, is the Dharma,
is the Guru.

178
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:12,690
They did not come like Me to convince you
and argue out with you.

179
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,940
They said: «Thou shalt not…».

180
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,780
That’s a commandment.

181
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:25,090
Commandment means there’s not to reason
why.

182
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,649
It’s a commandment.

183
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:34,580
There’s no rationality in Dharma.

184
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,750
Now, the one who is dharmic does not think
about sin at all.

185
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,070
Now, I’ll tell you about Myself.

186
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:58,130
Say, I go to a party and they start a cabaret
dance.

187
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:15,630
I do not think about it whether it is illegal
or whether it is wrong with this adharma,

188
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,180
nothing.

189
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:29,679
I do not think, but immediately I vomit.

190
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:48,710
My grand-children, you see, they one day were
watching the TV and three of them came vomiting.

191
00:25:48,710 --> 00:26:05,770
I went and saw the TV and it was a horrid
thing going on.

192
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:12,740
They just came and started vomiting.

193
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:20,210
There’s no rationality about it: it is against
human sustenance.

194
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:26,220
It is sub-human.

195
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:37,610
Like animals cannot feel the dirt or filth,
we can.

196
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:42,690
We feel horrible smell coming.

197
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:50,889
But those who work, say, in filth cannot feel
any smell.

198
00:26:50,889 --> 00:27:07,690
If you go near a factory where sugar is produced
you feel terrible there, get the smell of

199
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:28,190
these molasses and you can’t bear it, but
those who are working there are so much used

200
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:35,610
to it that they cannot feel it.

201
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:45,190
Those who live in sin cannot feel the sin
after some time, they become insensitive to

202
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,190
it.

203
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:52,090
But sin is a sin.

204
00:27:52,090 --> 00:28:00,559
So the insensitivity when we develop within
ourselves we become adharmic.

205
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,679
When we are sensitive about it, we are dharmic.

206
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:28,130
On the left-hand side, the intuition about
it, the auspiciousness of it – is the thing

207
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:38,710
that one has to learn, the auspiciousness.

208
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,850
A housewife is to be respected, honoured and
comforted because it is auspicious.

209
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,809
A wife has to be respectable.

210
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:57,660
A housewife doesn’t – It doesn’t look
nice for a housewife, you see, to be dressed

211
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,309
in a funny way.

212
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:09,570
Once a chief cabinet secretary from India,
his wife had come and she used to think she

213
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:19,160
is very young and smart or something.

214
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:35,039
She was wearing those tight jeans and things
like that, you see.

215
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:47,600
And the poor husband, you see, looked at this
side, that side.

216
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,990
He didn’t know what to do.

217
00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:20,799
And she is – I mean, very big man.

218
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:31,429
Alright.

219
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:45,840
And she came down in London, she was thinking:
«Oh, she is a great, smart thing», you know.

220
00:30:45,840 --> 00:31:00,419
And they were invited to a dinner – it’s
a real thing, you know, real thing that has

221
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:01,419
happened.

222
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:16,690
And when this man was to go from somewhere
and she had to go from somewhere else.

223
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:23,330
So, when he went there, he said: «Where is
my wife?»

224
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:28,240
Said: «She hasn’t come right now.»

225
00:31:28,240 --> 00:32:11,580
He said: «No, she was to come, she is not
like that, she is much smarter than me, she

226
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:18,809
must have arrived.»

227
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:26,820
He looked around, he couldn’t find her.

228
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:46,580
And there was a lady standing, he said: «There’s
your secretary has come, she is standing there.»

229
00:32:46,580 --> 00:33:02,149
And he didn’t know what to say because she
really looked like a secretary and not his

230
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,149
wife.

231
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:13,909
So the housewife has to be dignified and respectable
and she is to be respected.

232
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,200
It’s the part of that auspiciousness.

233
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:23,600
And the wife, that essence of a wife is the
governing…

234
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:32,279
So you can imagine those women who used to
stand for lib and all that and those who tried

235
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:40,779
to sort of say that: «Why should we be respectable
if the husband is not if he is carrying on

236
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:48,010
with the other women I should also carry on
with the other men.»

237
00:33:48,010 --> 00:34:02,049
You must know that you are withholding that
great position in the stomach, on the left-hand

238
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:07,149
side of every human being.

239
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:38,710
And that’s why the left Nabhi catches in
England so much; and in America, I think it’s

240
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,770
missing already (laughter).

241
00:34:41,770 --> 00:35:05,430
So, that is to ask to, say, to a man you see,
who is so developed, and is so, he thinks

242
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:23,030
no ends of himself, you see, and the civilization
where work is so important and money is even

243
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,160
more important than work is.

244
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:35,650
To him, it’s silly to think that a housewife’s
respectability is so important in the play

245
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,310
of the universe.

246
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,970
Yes, it is.

247
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:47,820
Where the women become dis-respectable the
whole – you see, that’s the breaking point

248
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,870
of the society.

249
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:56,500
There the human beings will start destroying.

250
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,760
That’s the real atomic bomb you have got.

251
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,270
But it is so, I cannot rationalize it, it
is made like that.

252
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:07,640
All the Gurus have said: «You should not
drink.»

253
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,060
Even Moses.

254
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:19,250
Every one of them has said: «You cannot drink»,
means take any kind of ann alcohol or any

255
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:29,770
things that will take away your awareness,
because that is the place of your awareness.

256
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:42,250
In the sense that whatever goes wrong here
spoils your attention, and if your attention

257
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:47,110
is spoiled, your awareness is spoiled.

258
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:53,190
The attention is in here.

259
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,210
The attention is in the stomach, in the Void.

260
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,010
So, how important is your attention.

261
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,840
Wherever you put your attention, that works
out.

262
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,320
When you are realized, then your attention
is realized.

263
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:23,610
Wherever you put your attention it works like
a spade, it works like a sword, it works like

264
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:34,550
a loving hand, it works like a kiss, it works
like a comforting heart.

265
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:43,970
It is an enlightened attention in your stomach.

266
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:53,850
You see, the mother has the child in the stomach,
in the womb, and how it looks after the child,

267
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,100
a little baby, how it protects.

268
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:07,510
All that is there is given to us through our
Gurus, our own beings which are our masters,

269
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,370
who teach us.

270
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,720
The stomach teaches you, your stomach is your
Guru.

271
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:22,440
Amoeba became a human being through the stomach
only, through the hunger it had.

272
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:30,310
If it did not have hunger it would not have
evolved.

273
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:44,690
And the hunger teaches you.

274
00:38:44,690 --> 00:39:04,640
And when you learn it properly, then you become
the Guru yourself of the whole world and the

275
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
universe.

276
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:12,180
Void, that’s why is very important, and
when you have had bad gurus, you have read

277
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:20,400
horrible books, accepted them as facts and
truths, then your Void gets spoiled, your

278
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
attention gets spoiled.

279
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,840
It goes to wrong things.

280
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:35,330
Attention, when it works through your eyes,
can also go to wrong things.

281
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:50,560
Everywhere wherever the attention moves it
can do wrong things if it is adharmic.

282
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,160
But as I said there is no rationality about
it.

283
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Dharma is to be accepted.

284
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,160
You cannot rationalize it.

285
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:06,900
To a point, you may try, but how far it harms
you, you cannot rationalize.

286
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,690
And then the curses of Divine comes on you.

287
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:17,050
Any kind of fanaticism or identification with
one ideal – like Muslims thinking they are

288
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,050
Muslims.

289
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,660
They are adharmic.

290
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,260
They are not dharmic.

291
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:29,230
Dharma is that you have to respect all the
religions.

292
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:34,670
It is a sin not to respect any incarnation.

293
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:47,450
It is a sin not to respect any religion.

294
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:55,620
And to identify with one and denounce the
other.

295
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:03,240
So, give up all these false dharmas and come
to that one Dharma which evolves you, which

296
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:14,440
gives you light by which you can see the oneness
among all these religions.

297
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:25,080
As I’ve said it before, that they are like
beautiful flowers on one tree nurtured by

298
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:33,820
one sap, adorned by one tree; but fools take
the flowers out, say that “These are our

299
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,270
flowers” and kill them.

300
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,890
And when these flowers die, ugliness becomes
the so-called religions.

301
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:47,850
So, in essences, respect all the religions,
and all the incarnations.

302
00:41:47,850 --> 00:42:01,220
Fanaticism is absolutely against the Nabhi
and against the Void because the whole balance

303
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,450
of your Void is to be kept.

304
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:15,450
In a very subtle and subtler form, you will
be sticking onto it.

305
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:30,990
Say, you are born a Christian, so whatever
you may try you cannot get out of this feeling

306
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,040
that “We are Christians”.

307
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:48,180
You’ll have much more respect for Mary in
heart than for, say, Lakshmi.

308
00:42:48,180 --> 00:43:00,120
While you are a Hindu, you will have much
more respect for Radha than for Mary.

309
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,400
That will be lingering on and lingering on.

310
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,680
When you develop that balance alright, then
you are dharmic.

311
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,980
That balancing has to be done.

312
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:27,030
So one realization is within you like this.

313
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:36,500
And one realization is this way, among you,
and this is Dharma.

314
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:50,210
Among all of you, there has to be another
integration, a complete integration of understanding.

315
00:43:50,210 --> 00:44:01,480
Whether you are white, black or red, whether
a Hindu, Christian or anything, you must know

316
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:25,980
that there is only one way that is the living
way of evolution and that there is only one

317
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,980
God.

318
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:36,700
And all of them are aspects of the same God,
and there is no quarreling among them.

319
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,390
Why are you quarreling?

320
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,150
This goes against the Void.

321
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:48,500
Complete integration works out in the stomach.

322
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,440
And when you are completely integrated, you’ll
be surprised, rationality drops out.

323
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,980
Automatically it drops out.

324
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:07,720
Rationality keeps disintegration because if
your heart says something, rationality says:

325
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,730
«No, it’s not right.».

326
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:22,230
But, if you take out your rationality there
and just see for yourself, then wisdom comes

327
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:28,800
in and you just do it whatever is wise and
good for your spirituality.

328
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,560
[Aside: “How are you now?

329
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,940
It’s better, it’s working out”.]

330
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:41,690
So, Void we use in Sahaja Yoga in many ways.

331
00:45:41,690 --> 00:46:02,890
First of all, we have to, first of all, see
the Void of a person, how he has got the Void.

332
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,320
You can see it very easily because it might
be pulsating.

333
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,590
Maybe not be in your presence, I don’t know,
but in My presence it does.

334
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:15,250
But immediately you can feel the Void.

335
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:21,660
The Void you feel on here, or on here.

336
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:40,890
Now, just see these are the bases of all the
chakras.

337
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:48,000
You feel the Void here, or here.

338
00:46:48,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Basis of all the chakras you can feel, so
you can understand how important is Void.

339
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:14,240
Now, if it is catching here anywhere, or catching
over here, you see, then you have to ask the

340
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:50,450
questions about these various points: whether
he is a materialist, whether he is a fanatic.

341
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:58,120
But these questions you cannot ask that directly,
because if I say: «Are you a fanatic?»,

342
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,570
he’ll hit Me hard.

343
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,570
[Laughter]

344
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,480
You have to be very, very clever about it.

345
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:17,690
Now, how to ask a person whether you are a
fanatic or not?

346
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:21,150
Very easy.

347
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:30,780
Say, he 
is a Muslim.

348
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:50,480
So, you just ask him to put your hand, saying
that: «Should I put some Kumkum on your head?»

349
00:48:50,480 --> 00:49:01,650
So his fanaticism will come out immediately:
«I can’t do this!»

350
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:23,760
If he is a Christian then you just ask him:
«Can you put a Swastika on your hand?»

351
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,640
Cross he’ll accept.

352
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,620
Swastika: «No, I’m not Hitler!»

353
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,640
(Laughter)

354
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:45,170
That’s how you can make it out whether he
is open-minded or not, by suggesting things

355
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,120
like this.

356
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,130
So then he comes out with his fanaticism.

357
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,070
Then what do you do?

358
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:00,770
You do not condemn him as fanatic, no.

359
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:03,700
That won’t be Sahaja style.

360
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:32,630
You say: «Alright, alright I’ve got it.

361
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,320
The cross, will that be alright?

362
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,370
Alright, take the cross.

363
00:50:39,370 --> 00:51:07,910
Now, if I say that cross was first Swastika
then it became cross, will you be angry?»

364
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:15,750
Gradually it will work out.

365
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:37,060
But if he is a fanatic you go outside and
tell Mohammad Sahib to beat him nicely.

366
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,460
So He’ll do the job.

367
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,680
Shoebeating is very necessary for all the
fanatics.

368
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,520
Nice shoebeating.

369
00:51:50,520 --> 00:52:01,930
But fanatics are one of the most difficult.

370
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:29,900
Then those who have been to other gurus also
will be showing up.

371
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:39,350
These days you don’t get fanatics so many
who’d come to Sahaja Yoga.

372
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:44,870
Mostly they are guru-bitten (Shri Mataji laughs).

373
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:53,220
You see, there are frostbitten people, there
are guru-bitten also (She laughs).

374
00:52:53,220 --> 00:53:01,420
I mean, you see, mostly they are guru-bitten.

375
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:10,720
Then you ask them: «Have you been to a guru?

376
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,530
What your guru has done?

377
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:16,380
This, that.»

378
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:28,380
If you tell them sometimes they can be fanatically
attached to their gurus.

379
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,880
Then they might be angry.

380
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,540
They do it, but what to do?

381
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:41,530
You see sometimes you have to tell them.

382
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,530
[A ring bells – apart:

383
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,680
Shri Mataji: It’s the food?

384
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,110
Yogi: Yes.

385
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,960
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

386
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:57,030
Shri Mataji: It’s good they are looking
after the food very nicely.

387
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:11,290
(Laughter) Otherwise, if you have to cook
also, then all your attention is there.

388
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:17,230
So, much better than your ashram.

389
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,010
(Laughter)

390
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,570
Yogi: Agreed!

391
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:49,300
Shri Mataji: No headache, nothing, you are
having a nice time here and their food is

392
00:54:49,300 --> 00:55:02,910
ready, now serve, come along, have your food.

393
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:11,420
Much better than your ashram.

394
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:24,520
So, the right time, we are talking about Void.

395
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,710
(Laughter) Alright.

396
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:32,500
I’ll sit here –

397
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:46,880
(Yogi speaks: “All our hunger has been satisfied
today."

398
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,670
Shri Mataji laughs)

399
00:55:51,670 --> 00:56:03,220
Shri Mataji: Yes, make the food also dharmic
and then eat it.

400
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,220
Good.

401
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,920
How are you now?

402
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,920
Better?

403
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,130
Yogini: Yes!

404
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,350
Shri Mataji: Yes!

405
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:29,270
This will do good to many because so many
have had this problem with guru business.

406
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:33,330
How are you now?

407
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:36,020
It’s good…]

408
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,710
[Tape interruption]

409
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:57,500
It’s such a wide subject that I cannot cover
it in one lecture, you’ll require many more;

410
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:10,970
but the most important thing about Void is
that that once you are enlightened, you become

411
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,710
dharmic yourself.

412
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:26,090
The Dharma starts flowing through your hand.

413
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:32,670
These vibrations have a capacity to establish
Dharma.

414
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:53,680
So, when you put your hands now towards the
five elements, say you put your hands towards

415
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:03,870
the water, or you put your hand in the water
– the water gets enlighted, vibrated.

416
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:15,830
Then if somebody takes that water, it will
establish Dharma into that person.

417
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:27,420
Supposing somebody is a drunkard, now you
put this vibrated water to him, give him to

418
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,420
drink.

419
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,420
He’ll feel nauseated after drinks.

420
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:39,880
He’ll throw away the drinks, then he will
stop.

421
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:51,820
Some of you have noticed that when you came
to Me first you felt a terrible nausea within

422
00:58:51,820 --> 00:59:03,400
you and you felt like vomiting, sometimes
you felt uneasy, you see.

423
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:20,220
So these vibrations through the water now
pass into your stomach and they establish

424
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:27,650
Dharma there, the proper relationship.

425
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:44,320
It so happens that if you go on taking this
water, the right-side is that physically you

426
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:58,310
feel alright, and the water can give you such
a power that you will never get cancer of

427
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:06,100
the stomach, never get any trouble with the
stomach.

428
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:13,710
But left-side side it has greater power, this
water, that it cleanses you – your sins

429
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:19,860
– and puts your attention, fixes it up on
Dharma.

430
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:31,270
So, your attention doesn’t do – you are
not tempted, that’s how you have seen people

431
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:35,380
who come to Sahaja Yoga can give up drinks
easily.

432
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:43,360
Because it turns your attention towards Dharma.

433
01:00:43,360 --> 01:01:13,340
Then if you want to take drinks you just don’t
feel like after some time.

434
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:18,410
You feel like vomiting, you feel like headache,
and all that.

435
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,880
And it happens so easily.

436
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:31,680
Now we know somebody’s reaction – he gave
up with all his drinking in no time.

437
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:44,470
Otherwise, it’s not possible to do it, but
because of this happening in the stomach,

438
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,260
now you cannot drink.

439
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,260
Just imagine.

440
01:01:47,260 --> 01:02:02,950
This is the great thing about Void is that
once you are enlightened you can give something

441
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:07,070
to the nature.

442
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:22,830
You have been drawing everything from nature
so far.

443
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:33,401
First time now you start giving something
to the nature.

444
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:37,230
And what you give to the nature is so nourishing
to it also.

445
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:46,000
Supposing you give vibrations to, say, fruits,
or to trees, or to flowers.

446
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:54,890
You will find they will be ten times more,
the growth will be much more, they will be

447
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:55,890
lustrous.

448
01:02:55,890 --> 01:03:06,820
And they will be very juicy, very tasty and
the whole atmosphere will be different.

449
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:30,150
Maybe after some time these trees, if they
will be standing there, anybody will be passing

450
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:47,860
that way, if he touches the tree they will
get the vibrations also from there.

451
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:54,060
So maybe a tree may become a curer, something
like that.

452
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,450
All those waters and all that, we talk of
«curing water», are nothing but vibrated

453
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,450
waters.

454
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:59,450
They are vibrated.

455
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:00,450
So, if the vibrated water goes inside, you
get cured.

456
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,560
So, this is on the left-hand side it works,
that it establishes your religion within you.

457
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,560
All the problems you have had is all completely
cleansed out by that.

458
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:16,790
In the same way, if you enlighten a light
– now here [Mother turns to the flame of

459
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:23,940
the candle] you have seen so many times just
here, what you can enlighten a light is.

460
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:29,840
So it starts going, see, both are there but
this one is working as if…

461
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:37,410
It’s actually also going vertically, but
this and this you have taking out the black.

462
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:44,930
It is because it is enlightened.

463
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,590
That is also enlightened, no?

464
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,780
So it may also take out.

465
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:52,140
But this one actually in the hand is taking
away the…

466
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,610
If you see these lights you can feel they
are like pulled out like this.

467
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,480
As if, you see, the realized lights are pulled
out like this, straight.

468
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,780
And, I’ve been to some of these churches
where they have these lights, and as soon

469
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,160
as I enter inside they all go “kakakakakak”.

470
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,390
(Shri Mataji laughs)

471
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:07,830
It is interesting to see how they start suddenly
glowing like that.

472
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:21,160
But people do not notice it because they do
not understand how, why it has happened, but

473
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,790
you can understand that.

474
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:30,740
So, if you put the light, enlightened light
–

475
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:32,960
Say, yesterday – the other day we had that
Havana, is the enlightened light.

476
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,310
Havana we had made it enlightened, Jagrut.

477
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:51,270
Then whatever we put into it, you see, our
badhas and everything, it burned whatever

478
01:05:51,270 --> 01:06:03,210
we wanted to burn away.

479
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:08,957
What is the beauty of fire is that, say, if
you have some mixed-up gold and you put it

480
01:06:08,957 --> 01:06:15,550
to fire, you will find the gold will be separated
and the filth or dirt or whatever is inside

481
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,550
it will be separated.

482
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,550
So, this quality, which is the right-hand
side quality of the fire is, becomes in the

483
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,140
left-hand side is that when you go near such
a fire, or you use such a fire or a light,

484
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,451
then what happens that whatever is unwanted
in you is burned away, and you get the pure

485
01:06:21,451 --> 01:06:22,451
thing.

486
01:06:22,451 --> 01:06:23,451
So it purifies.

487
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:26,587
Fire is a purifier and it is a melter, it
melts your heart.

488
01:06:26,587 --> 01:06:28,770
This fire melts your heart and you feel the
compassion.

489
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:38,430
So that’s how every element can be enlightened,
and this is the work done in the Void by your

490
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,430
Kundalini.

491
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,430
Kundalini goes to various places and She enlightens
all these elements in your stomach.

492
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,510
In the stomach, the basic principle is of
water.

493
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:52,230
The Void is covered with water, and in the
water there is salt, and the salt is nothing

494
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,230
but is the Dharma.

495
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,230
Is the Dharma, the salt.

496
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:55,320
That’s why when we give you salt what happens
– the salt that is vibrated goes and helps

497
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,270
you in the stomach.

498
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,270
And salt shows its own nature there by absorbing
all that is in you which is, we can say, is

499
01:06:58,270 --> 01:06:59,270
mobile there.

500
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:00,270
A person supposing is, has got a cancer problem,
then he should take salt.

501
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,270
If he has a right-hand side problem, he should,
she should just take sugar.

502
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:04,760
So these are the two qualities, you see, the
five of dharmas are done by salt and five

503
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,080
by sugar.

504
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:22,610
And these are the best solvents in the water,
as you know.

505
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,940
So, all these three things put together: water,
then salt, then the sugar, they solve the

506
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,460
problem of the Void.

507
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,480
That’s why we use these two things.

508
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,900
If you remember Christ has said that “you
are the salt”.

509
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:40,480
That means you are the Gurus.

510
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,240
Salt is the Guru.

511
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,240
That’s why he said: «You are the salt.»

512
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,240
Because you are the Gurus.

513
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:46,240
And salt dissolves into water.

514
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:58,030
Water is the Dharma.

515
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:11,440
They are the absorbers – (a noise covers
some words… probably “salt”) always

516
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,440
has a water of crystallization.

517
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,440
They, it cannot exist without, the salt cannot
exist without water.

518
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,820
So, the water and salt put together means
ocean.

519
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:20,210
So Void is the ocean within us.

520
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,069
That’s why it is called as Sagara.

521
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:26,069
That means all the oceans of the world are
in our stomach.

522
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:29,650
And if you want to hear them sometimes, you
can put your thumb in my ears and you can

523
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:34,630
hear it coming (as a sound?

524
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:36,449
Indistinct), you can hear it.

525
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:45,569
So this is all the time this ocean is churned
and out of it comes out all that is good,

526
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:57,230
and whatever is bad is burnt away, or washed
away, or made to – with the air – it is

527
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,789
made to be swept off.

528
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:15,059
So the air element is also there, air element
that we see all around.

529
01:09:15,059 --> 01:09:27,650
[Recording cut] … so the vibrated air is
a very important thing and it helps a lot.

530
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:28,650
[Recording cut]

531
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:29,650
So I’ve talked to you about all the four,
but the fifth one is Akasha, it’s the ether,

532
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:30,650
you can say.

533
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:37,650
That works out when you are a realized soul.

534
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,079
Then you, you also vibrate the Ether.

535
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:48,449
That’s how our main collective work is done,
through the Ether, you see.

536
01:09:48,449 --> 01:09:55,320
Now, supposing I want that you should get
a proper seat – “Whether you are going

537
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,320
or something, alright, take a seat, alright”
– anything materialistic you can say, or

538
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,320
My chair how do you down there, how will this…

539
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,320
I have to just worry about it, immediately
[Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers] the orders

540
01:09:58,320 --> 01:09:59,320
are sent, alright?

541
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,349
So, Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel, both
of them say: «Now what should we do?

542
01:10:00,349 --> 01:10:01,349
We must find a proper place.»

543
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:02,619
So, they take Don into consideration, [Shri
Mataji points to a yogi in the audience who

544
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:03,619
has just arrived and miraculously got a good
seat through Shri Mataji’s direction] then

545
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:04,619
they bring him down here and find out a nice
place for him.

546
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:05,619
Is all done through Ether.

547
01:10:05,619 --> 01:10:06,619
Ether, it becomes – when it is enlightened,
you see, then it communicates the ideas, the

548
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:07,619
things which are Divine or the desires, the
Divine desires are carried out.

549
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:08,619
And then you are placed into his hands, sometimes
you are surprised: «How am I here?

550
01:10:08,619 --> 01:10:09,619
How are you here?

551
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:10,619
How do I meet you?

552
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:11,619
I mean, I was not to come this side and then
now how did I come?»

553
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:12,619
All these things can be done through the Ether
which…

554
01:10:12,619 --> 01:10:13,619
Even we get our television and everything
through Ether.

555
01:10:13,619 --> 01:10:14,619
But on the television, if the Ether, if you,
if you, say, enlighten it, then it will so

556
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:15,619
happen, that a bad [spread?] program won’t
materialize.

557
01:10:15,619 --> 01:10:16,619
It won’t materialize.

558
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:17,619
It can work very dynamically.

559
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:18,619
You cannot imagine how these miracles take
place.

560
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:19,619
And real miracles are felt, you know of course
we do feel the miracles of all the other elements,

561
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:20,639
but it’s not so obvious as that of the Ether
because you are suddenly surprised: «How

562
01:10:20,639 --> 01:10:21,639
this?

563
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:22,639
Why?»

564
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:23,639
And it’s – everybody is surprised at it,
all here in in the plate you get all this.

565
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:28,651
So, this is done by Ether and it is so miraculous.

566
01:10:28,651 --> 01:10:29,651
It is so miraculous, that it is hard to believe
that it is possible.

567
01:10:29,651 --> 01:10:30,651
Now, this Ether works day-time and night-time.

568
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:31,651
It doesn’t take rest anywhere.

569
01:10:31,651 --> 01:10:32,651
It’s all the time up for us, means it is
all the time ready to work out the divine

570
01:10:32,651 --> 01:10:33,651
work.

571
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:34,651
All the time it is ready to work out the divine
work.

572
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:35,651
It doesn’t wait.

573
01:10:35,651 --> 01:10:36,651
It doesn’t wait for anyone to give orders
or anything; it’s just, just waiting there.

574
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:38,380
As soon as it sees that this is desired, alright,
nothing is to be told, just to desire and

575
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:39,980
you say that: «Oh, what will be happening
to such and such person?»

576
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:40,980
Finished, it’s done.

577
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:41,980
It has been transmitted.

578
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,449
The same Ether that transmits the – what
you call?

579
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:52,679
– the air transmissions which you receive
on the radios, radio transmissions.

580
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:54,199
The same one, when enlightened, does all this
job.

581
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:55,199
He works it out, everything.

582
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:56,199
Everything that you want it works it out.

583
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:57,199
And there’s how the angels show their…

584
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:58,199
[Shri Mataji searches the word in Marathi]
their miraculous feats.

585
01:10:58,199 --> 01:10:59,199
But it is worth noticing all that and watching
it, and witnessing it and noting it down:

586
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,199
«Oh, how it helped and how it worked out!»

587
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:01,199
And it also Ether when enlightened brings
people closer to Divine power.

588
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,199
It arranges and organizes.

589
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:03,199
But now, one would ask what is the necessity
for God to have such complicated methods of

590
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,199
“enlightening the matter”?

591
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:05,199
Why not it has already the enlightened matter?

592
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,199
It’s the question one should ask, I mean,
I’m asking as you people are there, so I’m

593
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:07,199
asking you.

594
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:08,199
Let’s see the answer.

595
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:09,199
[Recording interrupted.

596
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,199
Continuing of the recording is a conversation
about personal matters:

597
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,199
That’s your problem.

598
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:12,199
Yesterday I told you to say that “I’m
not guilty”.

599
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:13,199
It’s just a joke you are enjoying, you are
just playing games with yourself when you

600
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:14,199
say that.

601
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:15,199
Because you like to play such terrible jokes
with yourself.

602
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,199
Don’t say that you are guilty.

603
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,199
At all.

604
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,199
By saying that, you see, you are trying to
enjoy a sort of a sadism against yourself.

605
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:19,199
You are against yourself.

606
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,199
Self that is your Spirit.

607
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:21,199
The yogi: That’s what it feels like, it
feels like…

608
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,199
(Indistinct words)

609
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:23,199
Shri Mataji: That’s not a good thing.

610
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,199
That’s not what is wanted, is not what is
desired, so just don’t play on them.

611
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,199
Whatever are your moods are not correct.

612
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,199
They should not be there.

613
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,199
By your moods, you are lost.

614
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,199
Sometimes you get this mood, sometimes you
get another mood of aggression.

615
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:29,199
Whether is a temper or something like that.

616
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,199
And sometimes you get into this kind of an
apologetic mood.

617
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:31,199
Both are useless, absolutely useless.

618
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,199
Just throw them away.

619
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:33,199
Why should we do it?

620
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,199
Both are mythical.

621
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:35,199
– (The yogi speaks) – Yes, this positivity
also – this so-called positivity means aggression

622
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,199
on others, you start showing your aggression
on others.

623
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:37,199
You can aggress others also.

624
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,199
That’s even worse.

625
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:39,199
– (The yogi speaks) – That’s, that’s,
that’s, that’s the thing I was saying.

626
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:40,199
Be joyous, be happy for what God has given
you.

627
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:41,199
Watch the birds in the morning time.

628
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,199
See the flowers in the morning time.

629
01:11:42,199 --> 01:11:43,199
What do they have?

630
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,199
They are standing in the sun, in the rain,
they are facing the nature all the time.

631
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,199
Imagine the delicate petals of the flowers.

632
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,199
Do they show any signs of negativity or of
aggression?

633
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,199
They only emit fragrance.

634
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,199
Till they live they will emit fragrance.

635
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:49,199
When they will die, they are not bothered.

636
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:50,199
Aggressive person cannot come to Sahaja Yoga,
he cannot go very far.

637
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:51,199
Neither a negative person, but aggressive
cannot.

638
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:52,199
He’ll drop out.

639
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:53,199
Sahaja Yoga recedes from such people.

640
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:54,199
You have to be humble, but you are not to
be slaves.

641
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:55,199
In extremes at least one should know the difference
between the two.

642
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,199
You see, there is extremes, say something
is very black – then you can see the white

643
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:57,199
very clearly against it, isn’t it?

644
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,199
And when you know how to move from one extreme
to another extremes, you should be able to

645
01:11:58,199 --> 01:11:59,199
see both the things very clearly.

646
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:00,199
And that’s how you come to the center.

647
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:01,199
I mean, it is for your own good to be like
that.

648
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,199
You may say: “Yes, we understand, Mother,
but we can’t do it”.

649
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:03,199
Could try.

650
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,199
You just watch yourself and see how it works,
how your mind is working: it’s your horse

651
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:05,199
and you have to master it.

652
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,199
You are supposed to be a rider and the horse
is taking you somewhere wherever it feels

653
01:12:06,199 --> 01:12:07,199
like, either to negativity or to the positivity
so-called – means the aggressiveness.

654
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:08,199
It’s the horse that is leading you, not
you are leading the horse.

655
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,199
What kind of a rider it is?

656
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,199
And the horse is like a pendulum and you are
led by it.

657
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:11,199
And when you identify yourself with that horse
you think: “What to do?

658
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:12,199
It is happening."

659
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:13,199
You can control it.

660
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,199
You have to tell yourself, that is to tell
your mind to behave itself.

661
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:15,199
Otherwise, you people cannot go very deep
into Sahaja Yoga.

662
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,199
You have to go much deeper.

663
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,199
If you are worried about superficialities
you cannot go deeper.

664
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,199
Deep down is the Truth.

665
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:19,199
There lies all the joy.

666
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,199
All the trees, all the big trees have their
roots deep down.

667
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:21,199
Find out your roots: where are they?

668
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,199
They are all embedded in your heart and in
your Spirit, not in these superficial things

669
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:23,199
where your mind is moving with the wind, here
and there, just like a dead leaf.

670
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:24,199
If a big train arrives, and the train is faced,
say – with a – some sort of an obstacle,

671
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:25,199
it cannot stop.

672
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:26,199
But if there’s a little worm and if it wants
to save itself from the train it can.

673
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:27,199
It can hide itself away somewhere.

674
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:28,199
You are not a worm.

675
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,199
You are a human being.

676
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:30,199
A little living thing can do that much.

677
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:31,199
You are a human being and if you cannot stop
yourself from your destruction, then who can

678
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,199
stop you?

679
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:33,199
You see the nature: people live together.

680
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,199
Tiger lives in a forest and there are many
creatures who exist, too.

681
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:35,199
But if human beings cannot save themselves
with all the brain that they have, their dynamic

682
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,199
styles you see, with all the energy that they
have, with all the discoveries that they have

683
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:37,199
made, then who is going to save mankind?

684
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,199
Either you aggress on others or you kill yourself:
and then what should Mataji do?

685
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:39,199
Or what should anyone do under these circumstances
– but to make you face it?

686
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,199
In Sahaja Yoga, you can face it very clearly.

687
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:41,199
You can see others doing it also, but first,
you must see it in yourself.

688
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,199
Unless and until you see it in yourself what
you are doing to yourself, you cannot see

689
01:12:42,199 --> 01:12:43,199
in others.

690
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,199
When I say “you see it in yourself” you
become self-centered.

691
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:45,199
I mean, anything You say can be twisted.

692
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,199
When I say “you see it in yourself”, that
means you detach yourself and see in yourself:

693
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:47,199
what is your mind doing?

694
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,199
That’s how you can love others also that
they are doing the same.

695
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:49,199
Like a person, say, is fond of good food all
the time.

696
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,199
If he can see that he is hankering after good
food all the time, he is thinking about good

697
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,199
food, his mind is working like that – if
he can see that he can correct it also.

698
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,199
If he can see it.

699
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:53,199
Apart from that, when he sees somebody doing
it, he would not hate that person, but he

700
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:54,199
would help him to cure.

701
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:55,199
On the contrary, I have seen those who are
like that, hate the other person, make fun

702
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:56,199
of the other person, while they have the same
weakness.

703
01:12:56,199 --> 01:12:57,199
Why, why it happens?

704
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,199
There’s a, there’s a psychological reason.

705
01:12:58,199 --> 01:12:59,199
Because that point which is doing like this,
wrong in him – you hate that point in you,

706
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,199
subconsciously, and that’s what you hate
in others; but that is consciously.

707
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:01,199
If you hate that part in you consciously,
there wouldn’t be any problem.

708
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,199
That part which is negative, the part that
is telling you all these things, the part

709
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,199
that misleads you, the part that spoils you,
the part that covers the Self – you see

710
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,199
– in you, if you could manage to see that
and say: “No, not that part, no."

711
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:05,199
But then you start despising the rule (unclear
word).

712
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,199
It’s a very subtle thing: either you move
from this side to that side.

713
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:07,199
If I try to push you, you’ll just go like
a spring to the other end.

714
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,199
If I try to push on that side like a spring
you go to the other end.

715
01:13:08,199 --> 01:13:09,199
Thing is, the basic thing is the extremes
are to be avoided.

716
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,199
This is the basic point is: extremes to be
avoided.

717
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:11,199
If you feel you are getting negative, take
your shoe and beat yourself nicely.

718
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,199
Go out and shout or take a pillow and hit
it hard, alright?

719
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:13,199
But if you are negative inside, what you will
do you will go and beat your wife or beat

720
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:14,199
your husband, whatever may be the case.

721
01:13:14,199 --> 01:13:15,199
It’s a very simple thing for a Sahaja Yogi
to do, is to be amused about yourself.

722
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,199
Just be amused: “Look at this Mr.

723
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:17,199
So and So, now it’s me."

724
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,199
When you start seeing yourself like that,
you see, be amused at yourself.

725
01:13:18,199 --> 01:13:19,199
“Ah, so now, Mr.

726
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,199
So and So is coming up like this!

727
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:21,199
Oh, come along, come along, now the vanity,
come along!

728
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:22,199
I would like to see the vanity that I am.

729
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:23,199
See Mr.

730
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,199
Ego coming up.

731
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:25,199
Now, here Mr.

732
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,199
Ego stands."

733
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:27,199
(Laughter)

734
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,199
Then (Shri Mataji laughs) you will start seeing.

735
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,199
Be amused about it in the real sense, and
you will be surprised that these things will

736
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:30,199
drop out.

737
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:31,199
Yogi (not clearly audible): You know this,
I mean when You observe something, and You

738
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,199
say what You observed….

739
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,199
(rest is indistinct).

740
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,199
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, very much
so.

741
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:35,199
Yes.

742
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:36,199
Yogi: You’ll say that…

743
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:37,199
Shri Mataji: Yes.

744
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,199
Yogi: But we – but we’ll still not correct
it.

745
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:39,199
What’s wrong?

746
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,199
Shri Mataji: No, you should say: “Get away,
you take two running jumps and go away”.

747
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,199
That will help Me.

748
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,199
If you want to have phraseologies, I can tell
you, but I think you are much more equipped

749
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:43,199
in English language with all the beautiful
humour that have – you have.

750
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,199
Just play that on yourself, you see.

751
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:45,199
Humour is a beautiful thing that you can really
play on yourself, instead of playing these

752
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,199
melancholy songs (laughter) and foolishly
indulging into all this romantic nonsense.

753
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:47,199
(Laughter)

754
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:48,199
Better play some humour on yourself, sit down,
(with a deep sense of humour?

755
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:49,199
– Not clear) and enjoy the humour upon yourself.

756
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,199
It works wonders, you see.

757
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:51,199
And those who know how to laugh at themselves
are the best people.

758
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,199
[Tape cut]

759
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,199
All that was foolish is chiselled out and
you see the beautiful joy-giving Spirit manifesting

760
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,199
itself beautifully within you alone.

761
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:55,199
And all your worries, all your problems and
all negativity and so-called aggressiveness

762
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,199
and everything just disappears and you are
one with that.

763
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,199
And you are seeing through (all?) that, the
brilliance that it is giving.

764
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,199
You are seeing through and feeling the dignity
of that and the joy of it, the brilliance

765
01:13:58,199 --> 01:13:59,199
it is giving.

766
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:00,199
Just think, if you are the sun and you come.

767
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:01,199
And you see the sun coming, the rays coming
and working it out and curing and changing

768
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,199
the colours and giving life.

769
01:14:02,199 --> 01:14:03,199
Imagine, how dignified you feel and how beautiful
you feel.

770
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,199
But you don’t feel vain about it.

771
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:05,199
If you are that you just don’t feel that
there’s something special about it.

772
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,199
You just see it.

773
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:07,199
Vanity comes when you don’t have something.

774
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,199
When you have it, you say: “It’s alright,
it’s me”.

775
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:09,199
It’s just flowing.

776
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,199
It’s just watching how it’s beautifully
it is flowing.

777
01:14:10,199 --> 01:14:11,199
Because of scientific research in the psychological
sphere, this myth has come to us that if we

778
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,199
try to enjoy something like that then you’ll
become proud.

779
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:13,199
So you just don’t enjoy.

780
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,199
I mean the subtotal of the whole thing is
– psychologists – is this that you don’t

781
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:15,199
enjoy anything in life.

782
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,199
It’s the subtotal it comes to (She laughs).

783
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:17,199
If it is not worked with a Realized soul,
with the compassion and love and proper understanding,

784
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:18,199
it amounts to that.

785
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:19,199
That you just don’t enjoy anything in life.

786
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:20,199
You analyze everything: this way you are bad,
that way you are bad.

787
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:21,199
This way you are wrong, that way you are wrong.

788
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,199
So you are wrong completely, you should be
finished: you are good for nothing, useless,

789
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:23,199
thrown away.

790
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:24,199
End up in the lunatic asylums or in some other
wretched place, which is not meant for human

791
01:14:24,199 --> 01:14:25,199
habitation at all.

792
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,199
Idiotic it is, I must say.

793
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:27,199
Stupid it is!

794
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,199
It is like a – we call it in Marathi Dhoopatne,
is the thing we use for burning the incense,

795
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,199
you see.

796
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,199
It is hollow on this side and hollow on the
other side also because one side is the stand

797
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,199
and the another side is where you put the
incense.

798
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,199
So you take that Dhoopatna, and you ask for
something, you see.

799
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:33,199
So something is given on this cup, you turn
it round for the other side.

800
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:34,199
So, the other side you can see it, but see
this side that is filled in it’s gone, so

801
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:35,199
you go to see, you want to see the other side
now, that what is left in the other one, it’s

802
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,199
nothing is left altogether, it’s finished.

803
01:14:36,199 --> 01:14:37,199
So it is said that: ‘Hati Dhoopatne dene’
means this dhupatne is the thing is given

804
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,199
to you in the hand.

805
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:39,199
So first you see this side, you try to fill
the joy in the cup, alright?

806
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,199
Then you turn it around to fill the other
side of it.

807
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:41,199
But this side you receive it and the other
side is the support.

808
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,199
So you need not go to the right, then to the
left.

809
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:43,199
By the time you go to the left, the right
is over, and the right side you run up to,

810
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:44,199
the left is over.

811
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:45,199
Just be in the center!

812
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:46,199
Push yourself in the center.

813
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:47,199
Just be there.

814
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,199
See the silence.

815
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:49,199
Silence of joy crawls in.

816
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:50,199
[Long silence]

817
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:51,199
What’s it?

818
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,199
What happens?

819
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:53,199
[A yogi was asleep, exchanges on that, “Sleeping!”
people laugh]

820
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,199
That’s the best!

821
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:55,199
(A yogini says: “Still sleeping beautifully!”.)

822
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,199
Eh?

823
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:57,199
(More laughter and exchanges) That is the
best, this… (indistinct words).

824
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,199
Now, any questions?

825
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,199
Yogi: How far should we be concerned with
other people, Shri Mataji…

826
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,199
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

827
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:01,199
Yogi: (Not clearly audible) How far… should
we be concerned with other people, I mean,

828
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,199
in a situation where are other people there
who should now better understand…

829
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:03,199
Shri Mataji: Yes.

830
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,199
Yogi: … (Unclear audio) And yet you know,
you are dependent for them on the stupid ones.

831
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,199
(Shri Mataji laughs.

832
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,199
The yogi continues speaking but it is not
clearly audible)

833
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:07,199
Shri Mataji: Yes.

834
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:08,199
I would say, you see, Regis, that you have
wisdom.

835
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:09,199
All of you have your wisdom.

836
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:10,199
And you tell them in a way that you carry
the [boat?] as they say.

837
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:11,199
Because if you tell somebody: “You are stupid."

838
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,199
I mean, he will make hell for Me.

839
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:13,199
You’d better not do that (She laughs).

840
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,199
Alright.

841
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,199
Now, if you tell somebody that: “You are
very clever” when he is stupid (laughter)

842
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,199
if he is really…

843
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:17,199
Yogi (not clearly audible): When they think,
they know that, and then it’s not a stupid.

844
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,199
Shri Mataji: Yes, they will know that, too.

845
01:15:18,199 --> 01:15:19,199
Because people here are very clever, you see.

846
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,199
They are stupid in their wisdom.

847
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:21,199
But understanding that – what others are
talking and all that, they know very well.

848
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:22,199
So, best thing is whenever you have to work
on them, work on them secretly.

849
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:23,199
Give them a bandhan, give them shoe-beating.

850
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,199
But openly you give them tea.

851
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:25,199
[Laughter.

852
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:26,199
Yogi speaks…

853
01:15:26,199 --> 01:15:27,199
Vibrated…]

854
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:28,199
Vibrated, of course, of course, of course,
of course.

855
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:29,199
Keep Mataji’s photograph and a candle there
and then invite.

856
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:30,199
Give them tea.

857
01:15:30,199 --> 01:15:31,199
Give them some chanas.

858
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,199
You see, that’s how you have to work with
these people.

859
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:33,199
Because they don’t understand this, they
may be clever.

860
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:34,199
So, give them some Chanas.

861
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:34,699
When they want to have some water, give them
vibrated water.
