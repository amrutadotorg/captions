00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Every year comes a new year, and the last year gets completed.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:18.405
For Sahaja yogis every moment is a new year because they stay in the present.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:31.705
They stay neither in the future, nor in the past.

00:00:31.705 --> 00:00:41.588
Every moment for them is a new year, a new hope, a new wave.

00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:54.237
Just like while swimming in the ocean, every moment you are lifted by the love of the ocean.

00:00:54.237 --> 00:01:03.779
In the same manner, every Sahaja yogi is constantly feeling the bubbling of joy, love and peace.

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:09.527
But the actual point is whether we have learnt to swim or not.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:19.558
In Sahaja Yoga, whoever has learnt how to swim, he will always swim in joy, will swim in the ocean of joy.

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:30.215
If there is any shortcoming or flaw in Sahaja Yoga, it is that after Realisation, you have to become.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:34.903
Without achieving your becoming, you cannot achieve Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:56.868
Mother has put you in the water, but even after becoming a swimmer, you have to learn how to make others swim, how you can save others, how you can teach others to swim.

00:01:56.868 --> 00:02:01.616
You have to become that completely.

00:02:01.616 --> 00:02:08.605
If this is one flaw, it is in Sahaja Yoga, but it covers many flaws.

00:02:08.605 --> 00:02:16.031
Like in the past, gurus did not arrange straight away for your peace and joy.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:23.554
Earlier, they used to make you work hard, ask you to work hard, make you cleanse.

00:02:23.554 --> 00:02:28.552
Before getting peace of mind, you were made to cleanse your mind.

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:37.133
Before enjoying bodily comfort, you had to give a lot of hardship to the body.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:49.644
After great penance, people could achieve God Almighty, and these vibrations which you have achieved in Sahaja, they could know.

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:52.450
But Mother has made a different arrangement for you.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.882
First receive your vibrations [Chaitanya]. Come to understand that God Almighty [Paramatma] is there.

00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:04.131
Have faith in Him, that faith which is not blind but is built on truth.

00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:07.680
And now, with a little effort, you can accomplish a lot.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.238
Like when you teach somebody  you say, “Look, do not be frightened of the water.” You give them a lecture about it.

00:03:15.238 --> 00:03:20.495
First, you show the swimming on the land. Try the swimming strokes at that place, two to four times with your hand.

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:25.953
And after working hard for some days, then slowly they should be brought into the water. Soon after seeing the water, again they run away.

00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:30.445
Another method is to push them into the water. Then they keep learning.

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:36.918
In the same manner, you have been thrown into the ocean of joy.

00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:47.949
Now if you want to enjoy it fully, you have to make some effort, and that effort is that you have to become.

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.050
Without becoming it is not going to happen.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:04:01.494
A Sahaja yogi is a person who has total satisfaction, who has achieved, whose pure desire has been fulfilled, because Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

00:04:01.494 --> 00:04:11.396
In a person whose pure desire has been fulfilled, one whose power of pure desire has shown its miracles completely, there is no desire left.

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:15.351
A person who is fully satisfied is a real Sahaja yogi.

00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:21.836
If there is any unfulfilled desire still remaining, then it means that the awakening of the Kundalini is not complete.

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:24.073
You have not yet become a fully-fledged Sahaja yogi.

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:35.633
It is so surprising that even without becoming a proper Sahaja yogi, blessings keep coming, and miracles keep happening.

00:04:35.633 --> 00:04:44.555
You keep getting the benefits. You continue to be aware that “We are moving, everything is in place, things are happening, and we are progressing”.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:53.595
But the biggest blessing for a Sahaja yogi is that he gets the ability to give, and he gives.

00:04:53.595 --> 00:05:05.388
And he not only gives; he enjoys giving, which is a very unique joy, and that joy that you can never get from any worldly things.

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:10.218
And all other such blessings cannot bring about this kind of joy.

00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:18.062
The biggest blessing is that your power of the Guru Principle increases, and you develop the ability  to give it to others.

00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:25.851
When you gain this ability, then understand that the work of Mother is complete, and now your work has commenced.

00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:33.671
That state is not achieved until you have made the effort and you have become.

00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:44.398
This is the only condition of Sahaja Yoga, which I say as a Mother, that I  do  My best not to leave anything wanting.

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:56.754
From My side. I do as much as possible to see that nothing is incomplete from My side so that on account of Me, My children should not have any shortcomings.

00:05:56.754 --> 00:06:00.437
But your penance [tapasya] is also important.

00:06:00.437 --> 00:06:08.793
Without that, no work can be done. But it should not be that such penance is aggressive [ugra] or painful [santapta]). It is a peaceful penance.

00:06:08.793 --> 00:06:13.763
There is nothing hard in this penance. It is not a laborious penance.

00:06:13.763 --> 00:06:20.237
So, first of all Sahaja yogis should learn to love. This is a very big thing. Like, I hear complaints about some Sahaja yogi.

00:06:20.237 --> 00:06:24.773
When you say that Sahaja Yoga is a very good thing, still he insults his own mother.

00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:35.307
Then we talk about his wife. He beats his sister. He beats his wife. There are some who do not take care of their husband.

00:06:35.307 --> 00:06:44.018
There is no attention on children. In Sahaja Yoga, all this should be spontaneous. It happens spontaneously.

00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:49.367
If this does not happen, then what has Sahaja Yoga achieved?

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:59.433
When you have become a tree, whoever is sitting in the shelter of the tree, no problem can come on them. A tree can take on all the burden of difficulty.

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:07.424
Whoever is under your shelter, your relationship with them should be very loving and one of closeness.

00:07:07.424 --> 00:07:14.408
Now, whatever I am saying is being said individually to all of you, not to anybody else. Please understand this and listen.

00:07:14.408 --> 00:07:19.632
There are many people who feel that when I am talking to them, they think it’s about others; perhaps Shri Mataji is talking about them.

00:07:19.632 --> 00:07:32.094
So one should keep the attention on ourselves, that Mother loves each one of us individually.

00:07:32.094 --> 00:07:35.616
She knows about each one of us individually.

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:40.744
In the same manner we also should know everybody individually.

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:45.078
When we are unable to love our family, then we cannot love others.

00:07:45.078 --> 00:07:51.728
Understanding the needs of family, agreed many of these people [family members] may not get their realisation.

00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:56.164
It could be that they have some faults, but whatever is their need, do that.

00:07:56.164 --> 00:08:05.645
The idea of Realisation will be accepted only when they see some change in you. If you just take a stick and say, “Why do you not get your Realisation? Why don’t you come to Sahaja Yoga?”, then nobody will come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:08.362
On the contrary, this is not the way of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:08.362 --> 00:08:15.290
The system of Sahaja Yoga is that you have to impress others by your own ideals and your own personality.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.862
When the other person gets impressed, then you slowly bring him into Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:18.862 --> 00:08:26.152
Even if you somehow drag somebody and bring him to Sahaja Yoga, and make him sit, will he then get his Realisation?

00:08:26.152 --> 00:08:35.183
You only need to tell him. In full freedom he should come. If not today, he will be all right tomorrow.

00:08:35.183 --> 00:08:49.432
So, it should be kept in mind that when we are achieving our becoming, then along with us, many are also getting their becoming. And the attention of all these people is on us.

00:08:49.432 --> 00:08:51.551
How we are developing is a very important thing.

00:08:51.551 --> 00:09:01.332
And you should understand one thing, that suppose you have a guru, even if he is a realised soul, poor thing, he does whatever has to be done with his own effort.

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:05.875
He will not say that you become [a realised soul].  He will say, “He is already hopeless.

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:10.738
Okay. He has accepted me as guru and that itself is a great achievement. Let us see about it in his next lifetime.”

00:09:10.738 --> 00:09:20.344
But Mother has undertaken a much bigger job. Her desire is that everybody should be made a guru. It is a slightly difficult job, and also not so difficult.

00:09:20.344 --> 00:09:25.735
You all know that you all are in the making, slowly, slowly. Everybody is refining and becoming ready.

00:09:25.735 --> 00:09:34.795
That is why, when you are achieving your becoming, you should take more care of others. Do you forgive your neighbours and others?

00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:46.000
Have you forgiven everyone? There is a lot to learn about forgiving others. Many times I have said that forgiving others is the biggest means and weapon available to us.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:57.008
And if we do not use this weapon, we do not apply it, then we will not be able to arrange any other means in this Kali Yuga.

00:09:57.008 --> 00:10:02.632
After  acquiring this means of forgiveness, we have to look at people with forgiveness.

00:10:02.632 --> 00:10:07.950
Peace will come only when you forgive. Whoever does not forgive will not be able to get peace.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.037
Firstly, you forgive everybody and then you forgive yourself also.

00:10:12.037 --> 00:10:18.633
When you are able to do both these things, then you see that peace will come within you by itself.

00:10:18.633 --> 00:10:23.336
When the Agnya Chakra opens, then the door of peace opens up.

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:37.839
[Mother is talking to a Sahaja yogi in the background (not clearly audible).]

00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:52.352
Now another thing which is always there before Me, and I also tell you, is that a kind of discipline is required in the hard work put in by you for achieving your becoming.

00:10:52.352 --> 00:11:06.824
Many people say, “Mother, I do not have time.” And then you say that, “Mother, see I had this problem, and this problem has not become all right.”

00:11:06.824 --> 00:11:09.094
Then I can also say that I had no time.

00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:15.606
Whether I meet you or not, I will always have time for you.

00:11:15.606 --> 00:11:18.787
My work goes on 24 hours a day.

00:11:18.787 --> 00:11:22.128
You have to just look after your own work.

00:11:22.128 --> 00:11:27.596
For this, you have to combine both time and discipline.

00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:35.913
This body, without being disciplined, will become like a motor car which runs over all and does not know which ditch it will fall into.

00:11:35.913 --> 00:11:39.618
There is an easy way of disciplining your body.

00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:47.988
First of all, look at yourselves to see if two powers are active; one is the power of desire, and the other is the power of action.

00:11:47.988 --> 00:11:53.437
In the case of the power of desire, it should be such that there is only one desire, that is, pure desire.

00:11:53.437 --> 00:12:03.291
What is this pure desire? That we should unite with our spirit. We should become one with the spirit. This is pure desire. Give up all other desires now, this moment.

00:12:03.291 --> 00:12:06.307
Give up at least for a moment.

00:12:06.307 --> 00:12:09.725
Do not desire anything else from Mother. Just become one with the spirit.

00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:18.739
Ask only for this pure desire. Give up all other things, like this should happen, want this, want that, want a house. Give up all these things at this moment.

00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:28.105
At this time, just hold this thought in your mind: “This pure desire is to become one with God Almighty, and to become one with the spirit and have no other desire.”

00:12:28.105 --> 00:12:30.296
You will see that your Kundalini rises immediately.

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:37.787
And secondly, in your power of action, it should be such that whatever has to be done, it is to happen spontaneously [Sahaja].

00:12:37.787 --> 00:12:44.485
People think that the meaning of Sahaja is that we keep sitting, and everything will come in our lap. This is a very wrong way of thinking.

00:12:44.485 --> 00:12:53.735
This extremely wrong feeling has come in us about Sahaja that we keep sitting and things should come to us.

00:12:53.735 --> 00:13:07.222
You have seen that there is a seed which when we put it in the womb of Mother Earth, it looks like the seed has sprouted spontaneously. But is it Sahaja?

00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:20.570
Have you seen its effort – that poor small sprout which breaks open the  ground to come up?

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:36.800
Have you  seen the efforts of the small root, whose small cell on the tip, on the edge, digs itself in with a lot of effort? Now, what is its pure desire? It is how to secure  this tree in the Earth somehow.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.925
w, what is its pure desire? It is how to secure  this tree in the Earth somehow. Have you seen it have any other desire ?

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:53.168
Its only thought is how to go under the ground and find the place where there is water or the source of water,

00:13:53.168 --> 00:13:58.595
and from there  I can draw the water and give it to the tree.

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:08.073
It does not think of anything else. And with how much effort it fights with the stones, fights with the mud, and somebody else crushes it or troubles it in another way.

00:14:08.073 --> 00:14:12.157
Passing through all these slowly and with a lot of wisdom, it goes on its way.

00:14:12.157 --> 00:14:23.599
If any tree comes in its way, or anything comes in its way, it will go around it. If any roots of the tree come, it will go around it. And if any stone gets in the way, it will also go around the stone and make its way.

00:14:23.599 --> 00:14:35.015
In the same manner, a Sahaja yogi has to go about with a lot of wisdom and be a sensible person, and should take up responsibility in a way that “We are wise people”.

00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:51.214
The inner wisdom that we have is our quality, our symbol, our custom. The wisdom within us, that we should present on ourselves, like somebody proudly applies a vermilion [tilak], we  have to present our wisdom like with a tilak.

00:14:51.214 --> 00:15:00.810
And we are wise. The meaning of wisdom is that a person who is wise does not go in for tantrums and does not get upset.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:07.555
He does not slip onto small things and does not comment that, “This is not good. That is not good.” He speaks with wisdom.

00:15:07.555 --> 00:15:14.744
This is a sign of greatness, a sign of maturity. In Sahaja Yoga, a person who cannot be mature is not fit for Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:14.744 --> 00:15:19.267
You have to become mature, and wise as well.

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:31.582
It seems like a very difficult task, but it is actually not so much. We have seen small children in Sahaja Yoga. They are very wise, and they understand everything wisely.

00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:43.195
In the same manner, you also have a tilak of wisdom that you are now a Sahaja yogi, and wise also, and this is a subject of your Mother’s honour.

00:15:43.195 --> 00:15:51.391
Those who are not sensible – people will say that their Mother [Guru] has not taught them anything and not good.

00:15:51.391 --> 00:15:55.266
They call Her Adi Shakti, and some of these children are not good.

00:15:55.266 --> 00:16:08.950
With this wisdom in mind you should look at yourself that “We have a responsibility. It is essential that we become wise people before the world”.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:20.365
Today, on the occasion of this auspicious day of New Year, I would like to tell you that in Sahaja Yoga, we people should become very mature.

00:16:20.365 --> 00:16:27.838
New people have come; it is a matter of great joy. Before them are  old Sahaja yogis; their wisdom can be seen.

00:16:27.838 --> 00:16:34.350
They have come, they have not got their Realisation; yet something is there. Some are getting a few vibrations, and some are not getting it.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:42.736
There is something lacking; some problem is there somewhere. Some have got their Realisation so quickly and they feel that they have become great people.

00:16:42.736 --> 00:16:48.361
All sorts of mistakes happen. It should not be forgotten that you have also made mistakes.

00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:55.071
That is the reason you should show some maturity [badappan] to them. Showing maturity does not mean that we throw tantrums or project ourselves as if we are a big personality.

00:16:55.071 --> 00:17:01.392
Maturity means having a kind of paternal feeling, a fatherly feeling, a motherly feeling.

00:17:01.392 --> 00:17:12.396
You need to look after the new seekers with this feeling, having love towards them like the love your Mother has for you.You should love them like that.

00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:20.988
If we think that the people of the world are absolutely useless, then would we have been able to work out Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:20.988 --> 00:17:27.162
And if we only go on comparing ourselves, then we are alone in this world.

00:17:27.162 --> 00:17:34.981
With whom can we compare ourselves? But that question does not arise at all. Here it is like how many can we bring in to our shelter?

00:17:34.981 --> 00:17:42.694
Now our numbers are less. In this shelter, who do we bring? Who can we keep? This is the concern.

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:46.507
In the same manner, in your attention there should be maturity with love.

00:17:46.507 --> 00:17:59.368
It should not be such that some people call you a very great person. I prefer you should have very simple, Sahaja love within you.

00:17:59.368 --> 00:18:05.400
And in that simple Sahaja love, you should have a fatherly feeling, and a feeling of understanding.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:15.428
I have a lot of confidence in you, a lot of confidence In any matter, whether it is the matter of money, or your wisdom.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:20.963
I always think that My children can never be unwise.

00:18:20.963 --> 00:18:30.815
Sometimes they are, but I have full faith that you all are very wise and of very high quality.

00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:34.913
Now, you see how bad the condition of our country is.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:38.006
Even if you search, you will not find a single upright person.

00:18:38.006 --> 00:18:48.006
Now even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you do not improve your condition, then you will be like the crores of other such people in this country. How you can you be anything special?

00:18:48.006 --> 00:18:53.999
You have to be a special kind.

00:18:53.999 --> 00:19:01.634
Now, many people say that, “Mother, these days if we don’t cheat, we cannot survive.” This is not correct.

00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:10.523
You give it up and see. In the Kingdom of God, nobody can die of hunger. “Yoga Kshema Vahamyaham.

00:19:10.523 --> 00:19:15.869
Yoga Kshema Vahamyaham”. We will say again, “Yoga Kshema Vahamyam”.

00:19:15.869 --> 00:19:19.525
After you get your Yoga, your wellbeing [Kshema] is My responsibility.

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:26.661
So, there is no necessity to do anything which is wrong. I will look into the rest.

00:19:26.661 --> 00:19:33.385
God Almighty has saved you from so many bad circumstances and He will continue to save you.

00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:35.984
Rest assured about this.

00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:40.817
That is why you do not need to fall into any trap. These days, thousands of traps have come about.

00:19:40.817 --> 00:19:46.659
There are thousands of traps from which Sahaja yogis have to come out. What is the wise thing?

00:19:46.659 --> 00:19:51.044
Now, the dowry system is still continuing as a practice here.

00:19:51.044 --> 00:20:00.867
For Sahaja yogis, it is not appropriate to give a dowry to anybody, or to take a dowry.

00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:07.293
Firstly, you should not do such lowly things. Secondly, many people feel that we have to marry in our own caste.

00:20:07.293 --> 00:20:09.469
This is also a sign of foolishness.

00:20:09.469 --> 00:20:14.228
What is your caste?  You do not have any caste. You have become a yogi.

00:20:14.228 --> 00:20:18.974
There is no caste for yogis. Is there is any caste for a sanyasi?

00:20:18.974 --> 00:20:33.471
Recently, we went to a Dargah [tomb or shrine of a Muslim saint]. There he said that, “Sir, this is Auliya Chishti [a Sufi saint].” He said his nephew was also Auliya.

00:20:33.471 --> 00:20:39.735
Then I asked, “What is the caste of this Auliya?” They said, “Auliya has no caste. I am also Auliya. We have no caste.”

00:20:39.735 --> 00:20:47.831
The meaning of caste is aptitude. Caste – that which you have since your birth.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:53.316
This cannot be acquired  from the time of birth that you are born in Brahmin caste, or in Vaishya, or Shudra caste.

00:20:53.316 --> 00:20:57.979
Not this.  When you were born, what was  your aptitude ?

00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:05.880
This is another problem in our country, the caste system, which Shri Guru Nanak has broken to a great extent. Shri Guru Nanak  broke it to a great extent.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.870
Saint Kabir broke it. But now their followers have made another caste, Even in that caste, other castes have been made.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.253
Among Sikhs are there any fewer castes?

00:21:14.253 --> 00:21:19.079
They have also become caste-based. Sikhs cannot have a caste at all. Whoever is a Sikh cannot have a caste at all.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:24.838
This is the thing: whatever got broken, they have become just that.

00:21:24.838 --> 00:21:33.356
Amongst Hindus, whatever castes  were there, were all according to their Karma.

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:52.547
Matsyagandha was a fisherwoman whose son, who was born outside marriage, turned out to be such a child, Vyas, who wrote the Geeta.

00:21:52.547 --> 00:22:02.710
Just think where this has taken us. Why? Why this way? Why not someone from a Brahmin family  who was a so-called “pure” person?

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.685
This is a really big joke.

00:22:06.685 --> 00:22:10.419
Why hasn’t such a person written the Geeta? Think about it.

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:16.073
Why did Shri Krishna get it written by Vyas? What was the reason?

00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:24.355
This was because he wanted to break this very thought, and he wanted to get it written by such a person who was the son of Matsyagandha.

00:22:24.355 --> 00:22:27.222
He went to the house of Vidur, and ate food. Why?

00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:36.523
Just in order to break the custom. Shri Rama ate an already eaten fruit given by a woman of the Bhil caste. Why? Just in order to break this kind of foolish customs.

00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:41.931
Could he not have survived without the jujube fruit [Ber]?

00:22:41.931 --> 00:22:50.464
And even in case somebody eats because Shri Ramachandraji tasted, they would immediately go and wash their mouth.

00:22:50.464 --> 00:23:00.383
Why did he do all this? It has to be thought about. Knowing full well, why did he do all this?

00:23:00.383 --> 00:23:12.437
Because such types of beliefs were getting strengthened in our country. Caste, creed and all such foolish and useless things had to be completely broken.

00:23:12.437 --> 00:23:16.215
Just think, thousands of years ago such things took place.

00:23:16.215 --> 00:23:19.994
Prahalad was born in the house of a demon [Rakshasa].

00:23:19.994 --> 00:23:30.292
Shri Krishna’s own uncle was a Rakshasa, and see how he jumped from one place to another.

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:34.505
Shri Krishna also landed where his own uncle was a demon. Could he not have got anyone better?

00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:44.027
Why did he have Kansa as his maternal uncle? Why did he make him? Have to think.

00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:50.164
Because in spite of being his uncle, he had to kill him.

00:23:50.164 --> 00:24:02.849
This relationship business, for which we sell our country, these relatives, my brother, my son, my so and so relation, and all this, we give so much importance to these wasteful things.

00:24:02.849 --> 00:24:14.964
Shri Krishna said that, “If Kansa is a demon, even if he is my maternal uncle, I will kill him.” This is the special quality in Indians.

00:24:14.964 --> 00:24:18.556
It is a different matter with the Western people. While talking to them, we have to say something else.

00:24:18.556 --> 00:24:25.562
There is a difference while talking to them. Those people do not pay heed to anybody, not even their own son.

00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:28.398
If they understood, then there would not be any other closer relationship for them. A son will kill his father; a father kills his son.

00:24:28.398 --> 00:24:33.408
It seems everybody is a demon in this matter.

00:24:33.408 --> 00:24:42.641
In India, there are such people that even if their son is a murderer, his mother will say, “Son, it does not matter. You have only committed  a murder. Just wash your hands, come and have your food.

00:24:42.641 --> 00:25:00.082
It does not matter. You are my life, no problem. Have your food – no matter that you have committed a murder – and come.” This is our country.

00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:07.868
These blind eyes that we have, this has been done only to open them.

00:25:07.868 --> 00:25:25.643
In the same manner, these caste and traditions, our blind faith in temples, mosques and all such things and even in Gurudwaras also, to open the eyes towards such blind faith, people have done a lot of hard work, put in a lot of effort, a lot of effort.

00:25:25.643 --> 00:25:34.251
Shri Guru Nanak himself wrote.  He got the Granth Sahib made because people give their own interpretations to the religious texts [Shastras].

00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:40.034
So he got the Granth Sahib made by such Gurus who were realised souls.

00:25:40.034 --> 00:25:44.580
Now Granth Sahib is being read, but at least  take note of what has been written in Granth Sahib.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:50.928
Whatever truth he has written, at least understand the essence of that. Otherwise you will be disrespecting Shri Guru Nanak.

00:25:50.928 --> 00:26:00.482
For the very same reason such confusion and illusion  has affected all the religions so badly.

00:26:00.482 --> 00:26:10.244
To the extent that people say that Shri Krishna had incarnated as Mohammad Ghazni, because Brahmins had been robbing the people [loot machana], and that is why Shri Krishna had incarnated as Mohammad Ghazni.

00:26:10.244 --> 00:26:21.995
This is the story. When he looted the Somnath temple, Shri Shiva [Shankarji] ran away from there and reached Shri Bhairavnath temple

00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:28.983
and said, “My friend, please save me from this person. He has been following me.” Shri Bhairavnath said, “You are Shri Shiva. You are not afraid of anyone.

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:33.026
What is the necessity for you to feel frightened? You just open your one eye and everything will be all right.”

00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:43.660
Shri Shiva said, “You go and see who he is. He is sleeping.” When Shri Bhairavnath went and saw that Virat himself was sleeping,

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:50.120
he said, “Who in the name of God, will kill him?” Then Shri Bhairavnath said, “Mother has given me one power. I will use that power.”

00:26:50.120 --> 00:27:02.400
Shri Brahmari Devi had given the power of beetles ([hrunga]. So, by using the power of beetles, the bees [Bhramar] went and by continual humming, they did not allow Shri Krishna to sleep.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:11.463
It is important for Shri Krishna to sleep at intervals, without which a lot of havoc would be created in the world, because his power of destruction [Hanana Shakti] is quite powerful.

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:16.505
People say that Shri Krishna got frustrated and he went away.

00:27:16.505 --> 00:27:21.770
Whether there is any truth in this story or not, I will not say anything on that matter.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:34.823
But this much I will say, that when people trouble a person to this extent, then this kind of a story can also come about.

00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:42.772
When in the name of God they are torturing others, having bloodshed [khoon kharaba], all these kinds of things are happening,

00:27:42.772 --> 00:27:47.177
then people will say about God that there is no such thing as God.

00:27:47.177 --> 00:27:51.284
To have faith in God becomes impossible.

00:27:51.284 --> 00:27:58.729
I do not consider it their fault, because those who are doing such things in the name of God are so evil [mahadushta].

00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:02.975
Now imagine if a yogi is making a gun [banduk].

00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:12.467
Now, I am not able to understand what the relationship between a yogi and a gun is. “My friend, you tell Me, is your name Yogi?”

00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:20.881
Many people have asked Me what the relationship between yoga and a gun is.

00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:25.484
I said that it is neither Shri Krishna’s battle nor the Devi’s battle. What gun?

00:28:25.484 --> 00:28:29.444
They must be imagining some weapons.

00:28:29.444 --> 00:28:36.764
So, such type of insane [vikshipta] and bizarre [vichitra] people have come in the present world.

00:28:36.764 --> 00:28:44.184
Such things also reflect God’s name. So some people think that God is just a myth, or cannot be actually there.

00:28:44.184 --> 00:28:46.402
Now, only Sahaja yogis know the actual truth.

00:28:46.402 --> 00:29:00.073
Clearly they know and not just by intellect, but through vibrations, that God is there and His All-pervading Power is operating everywhere. Only Sahaja yogis know this.

00:29:00.073 --> 00:29:07.637
Now, you people have understood quite a lot. Now, I am telling you that whatever you people know, even great, great yogis do not know – I mean the real yogis.

00:29:07.637 --> 00:29:16.724
I am talking about real yogis; they also may not know. But having this knowledge is such a thing. It is like music coming from the radio, and has no effect on the radio.

00:29:16.724 --> 00:29:24.266
This and beyond [aar-paar]! Whatever you had to know, you have come to know quite a lot.

00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:31.589
And you also know on the vibrations. But these vibrations are not working within us.

00:29:31.589 --> 00:29:34.941
They are working outside.

00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:37.306
They have to be made to work inside as well.

00:29:37.306 --> 00:29:45.455
That is the reason I tell you to discipline yourself. Make your instrument all right, and take these vibrations inside yourselves.

00:29:45.455 --> 00:29:52.237
In this regard, I say that people from Maharashtra work very hard. They are very hard-working.

00:29:52.237 --> 00:29:58.722
That is the reason their progress in Sahaja Yoga is very deep. It is becoming deeper.

00:29:58.722 --> 00:30:08.300
That is the reason you should take care to get up every day, early in the morning.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:16.504
Now in England, it is so cold, and it is the biggest sin for the Britishers. If you want, kill them, murder them, they will not say anything.

00:30:16.504 --> 00:30:19.889
But if you wake them up in the morning, then the person is gone, finished.

00:30:19.889 --> 00:30:23.063
There is no other sin greater than this in England.

00:30:23.063 --> 00:30:30.376
If you wake up anybody before 9 o’clock in the morning, there is no bigger sinner, wicked, demon other than you.

00:30:30.376 --> 00:30:36.409
In such a country these people [Sahaja Yogis] get up in the morning at 4 o’clock and have a bath at 4 o’clock.

00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:41.795
The reason for this effort is that whatever discipline they had before, now they have put it into Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:41.795 --> 00:30:48.712
We people were never disciplined. We are all liberated people. We are all the spirit. “I am Brahma.”

00:30:48.712 --> 00:30:56.371
All have become the spirit [Brahma]. When they have done so much hard work, can’t we?

00:30:56.371 --> 00:31:00.530
“Now Shri Mataji, do not ask us to get up at 4 o’clock in the morning. It will be too much.”

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:05.805
I will not say. But you must think, when do you have time?

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:10.798
They get up in the morning and sit for meditation in the cold of London.

00:31:10.798 --> 00:31:16.826
And with that hard work only, they have achieved.

00:31:16.826 --> 00:31:24.448
It is hell there. In that hell they have created heaven. Then to light a few lamps in heaven should not be difficult.

00:31:24.448 --> 00:31:28.773
This is heaven only. Leave alone other matters.

00:31:28.773 --> 00:31:36.281
This is a big thing. This country is a great country. To do this work in this country is not a hard task.

00:31:36.281 --> 00:31:45.090
That is the reason I am telling you that the future leaders are you yourselves, sitting here.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:59.865
Now, any political or social and any other such movements, in all of them there should be the principle of the spirit. Otherwise, it will not work out.

00:31:59.865 --> 00:32:06.976
Now, you all are tomorrow’s leaders. They will be from you. Only through Sahaja Yoga will you be ready.

00:32:06.976 --> 00:32:33.980
Now, I have to ask you how many of you will be ready and want to make your life pure, beautiful and completely dynamic, becoming fearless, completely fearless, and will become special people?

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.787
And we are. You have become.

00:32:36.787 --> 00:32:47.338
As you say, you have become twice-born [Dwija]. An egg was there, the egg of Ego, Superego. After it is broken open, you become a bird.

00:32:47.338 --> 00:33:03.319
Like a small bird is even weaker than the egg, for that reason should be given a lot of encouragement, should be protected, should be cherished [sanjona] and kept pure.

00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:08.391
Love should be pure. Pure love. Very few people understand the meaning of this.

00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:25.929
What is pure love? Pure love is that which has no greed, nor does it have lust; no greed, and no lust, and there is no type of filth.

00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:28.856
It goes on flowing endlessly.

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:34.271
The light of this pure love should flow from within us.

00:33:34.271 --> 00:33:44.654
This pure desire should be within us. When this starts happening, then you will become an admired Sahaja yogi – not before that.

00:33:44.654 --> 00:33:51.975
And this speciality of becoming should be given due attention.

00:33:51.975 --> 00:33:57.085
Today, you will say, “Mother, please make this all right. Mother, please make that all right.” OK, I will do it.

00:33:57.085 --> 00:34:06.775
I will do it. I will do it. But nothing will happen for you. A child will say, “Mother, please give this to me.” OK, child, take it. You want it, take it.

00:34:06.775 --> 00:34:09.161
But you have not become anything special.

00:34:09.161 --> 00:34:11.988
You have not achieved anything.

00:34:11.988 --> 00:34:16.871
You just went on running after Mother. What is the benefit?

00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:25.868
Whatever Mother wants to make of you, if you do not become that, then even Mother’s pure desire will not be fulfilled.

00:34:25.868 --> 00:34:33.931
It is an odd direction that you should become, and that is My pure desire from within.

00:34:33.931 --> 00:34:38.709
And you have pure desire from within that you want to become something.

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:43.994
When we are in unison like this, let us just be with pure desire.

00:34:43.994 --> 00:34:48.719
And the first thing that is required to be with pure desire is pure love.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:53.542
And in order to bring purity in us, we have to purify our attention.

00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:59.725
When we go to someone’s place, then what do we see first?

00:34:59.725 --> 00:35:06.416
“Oh, they have got this good thing. Where has it come from? How did they get it?”

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:09.691
The brain starts to run.

00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:18.433
They do not see how nice this thing is, how has it been made. Praise, Praise, Praise [Wah-wah-wah]. See and enjoy. Good, it is not our headache. It is somebody else’s, and it is very nice.

00:35:18.433 --> 00:35:35.917
When you look at others, you should have an appreciative temperament, but mostly the gaze goes on the defects of the person.

00:35:35.917 --> 00:35:43.388
Like somebody says, “My friend, the girl is good, but not attractive.”

00:35:43.388 --> 00:35:54.962
What is the meaning of attractive? What? Will you get stuck to her at once? What is being attractive?

00:35:54.962 --> 00:36:00.506
Till today, I have not understood the meaning of the word attractive.

00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:09.245
Especially the meaning of the word attractive, I have not been able to understand till today.

00:36:09.245 --> 00:36:17.868
Like, “Sir, she is not attractive.” I said, “My friend, what is the meaning of attractive? What things attract you?

00:36:17.868 --> 00:36:25.557
Their nose, face, hands, skin, clothes or what? What is the thing?”

00:36:25.557 --> 00:36:32.329
Only one thing should attract: another person’s spirit.

00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:35.466
That is the only thing that gives joy.

00:36:35.466 --> 00:36:42.058
By keeping our attention outside, our attention gets entangled.

00:36:42.058 --> 00:36:48.326
The attention should become deep, penetrating, deep.

00:36:48.326 --> 00:36:49.805
How is it possible?

00:36:49.805 --> 00:36:54.085
The moment you meet somebody, “Sir, he is not all right. This person’s state is not all right”.

00:36:54.085 --> 00:37:01.413
The effort is wasted. That person is finished; his spirit is also gone. All the hard work done by God Almighty on that person has been wasted. He is not all right. It’s all over then.

00:37:01.413 --> 00:37:06.344
Did you go into its depth? Did you see? Did you search for what it is?

00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:16.202
Go deep and see, and then you will see that he is great at the depth within, whatever he may be externally.

00:37:16.202 --> 00:37:22.677
Even if they seem to be great externally and think they are great, they are sometimes very jumbled up inside.

00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:28.999
That is why you have to judge from your depth what is there, and put your attention on his depth. Then you see how much love flows. Love is of the  depth.

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:34.213
When you look at anyone, measure their depth.

00:37:34.213 --> 00:37:37.683
Then you yourself will start going deeper into it.

00:37:37.683 --> 00:37:46.949
It is like “In the heart, I am making somebody’s way. I am making a way into somebody’s heart. I am going on making the path”.

00:37:46.949 --> 00:37:50.582
In a similar manner, just get into their depth.

00:37:50.582 --> 00:37:58.517
By remaining in superficiality, your attention will not be able to go deep, and till such time as the attention goes deep, your depth will not increase.

00:37:58.517 --> 00:38:01.115
So, you have to first get your attention deeper.

00:38:01.115 --> 00:38:07.863
The attention is currently on many external things. Like our ladies – I will talk about men also – like whether the blouse is matching or not.

00:38:07.863 --> 00:38:10.122
For that they will break their heads.

00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:13.880
Blouses should be matching.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.990
In our times nobody ever wore matching blouses.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.035
With a blue sari we used to wear a yellow blouse.

00:38:22.035 --> 00:38:25.279
It was straightforward.

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:28.388
If there was no yellow, red would be all right.

00:38:28.388 --> 00:38:34.968
Like, previously, there never used to be a contrast border; it would become a contrast. If it was not, then just wear it as it is.

00:38:34.968 --> 00:38:40.751
Now in the past, how many saris did a person have? Two or three, however rich they were. Nobody used to keep lots of clothes.

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:49.217
Now everything is about matching. Now ladies have a problem that if they do not wear matching clothes, then there will be an uproar in the whole city.

00:38:49.217 --> 00:38:53.312
“Look at the type of clothes she is wearing and how stupid she looks.”

00:38:53.312 --> 00:39:07.043
But if she wears a funny type of jeans and comes with two horns, then she is modern.

00:39:07.043 --> 00:39:16.894
She is modern. Such norms, such things that have been made by us, we go on getting tied up in those norms.

00:39:16.894 --> 00:39:18.620
Now men have a different kind of problem.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.688
When do they have the time for matching their clothes? They keep seeing the watch.

00:39:22.688 --> 00:39:33.777
Every man has a watch. “What is the time”? “How much  time has gone?”

00:39:33.777 --> 00:39:43.092
When it is time to leave, instead of leaving the place, being leisurely, they are after the ladies. “Come on, there are only two minutes left, just one minute left.”

00:39:43.092 --> 00:39:45.084
Must have been timekeepers.

00:39:45.084 --> 00:39:50.203
In that time, the women forget some twenty-five odd things; they also forget, and run out.

00:39:50.203 --> 00:39:58.021
So much hurrying, so much hurrying. “It has become  late.” Look at the watch, state the time and pester; this is also a modern thing.

00:39:58.021 --> 00:40:08.442
In the olden times, nobody used to behave this way, because previously there were no trains. And which train was on time, that you are hurrying so much?

00:40:08.442 --> 00:40:13.305
Nor do planes stay on time. You keep running for the plane.

00:40:13.305 --> 00:40:21.523
Did you know, yesterday, we sat there from morning to evening; the plane did not arrive.

00:40:21.523 --> 00:40:27.144
We were just sitting. But while leaving the house, there was so much hurrying, we forgot this, forgot that.

00:40:27.144 --> 00:40:31.908
Three times the vehicle was sent to get it, still the plane did not come.

00:40:31.908 --> 00:40:38.595
You will say that, “Mother is only doing all this, because we are slaves of the clock.” It is possible.

00:40:38.595 --> 00:40:43.689
To be so much of a slave of the clock also makes a person mad.

00:40:43.689 --> 00:40:52.442
When you come to Sahaja Yoga, you should know that the plane will be waiting for you.

00:40:52.442 --> 00:40:55.752
You come leisurely like a King [Raja Sahib].

00:40:55.752 --> 00:40:58.552
The plane will not take off, whatever happens.

00:40:58.552 --> 00:41:03.236
The plane will be standing there, or maybe will arrive late.

00:41:03.236 --> 00:41:12.474
If you are delayed, there is no problem. Go like a King, and in case you miss the plane, then go by another plane. Perhaps something may be working out.

00:41:12.474 --> 00:41:18.431
Maybe from that, someone has to come into Sahaja Yoga. Like this, so many things happen.

00:41:18.431 --> 00:41:23.268
If you go on linking the events, you will reach from some place to somewhere else you can’t know.

00:41:23.268 --> 00:41:28.203
Once, I was going through Geneva. I have never missed a flight till now.

00:41:28.203 --> 00:41:33.359
This is also an amazing thing. One gentleman had missed his flight.

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:39.552
He came hurriedly into the plane. By coincidence, he got a seat by My side.

00:41:39.552 --> 00:41:41.911
He was very nervous. His condition was quite bad.

00:41:41.911 --> 00:41:47.183
He was a Maharashtrian. I understood that he had come into My fold.

00:41:47.183 --> 00:41:57.047
I said to Myself, “Bitter gourd flavoured with neem” [for him a situation that turned out to be even worse than expected]. He has to be taken into the fold now.

00:41:57.047 --> 00:42:04.147
I spoke in Marathi, “Sir, what is the problem?”

00:42:04.147 --> 00:42:11.438
He started speaking in Marathi, pure Marathi. He said, “I missed my flight. See what has happened.”

00:42:11.438 --> 00:42:14.853
I said, “Nothing has happened to you. Some good things are going to happen to you in this flight.”

00:42:14.853 --> 00:42:18.974
He saw Me. He asked, “What good things will happen?”

00:42:18.974 --> 00:42:21.588
Then he realised. “Are you Mataji Nirmala Devi?” I said, “Yes.”

00:42:21.588 --> 00:42:27.717
He was taken aback. He got his Realisation during the flight.

00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:32.101
His name is Dr. Muthalik.

00:42:32.101 --> 00:42:38.803
He said, “Oh, I was so anxious, and how could I know that I am going to get my Self-realisation [Aatma Sakhatkar]?”

00:42:38.803 --> 00:42:42.715
I said, “Yes, relax now.” And after that, you know what happened.

00:42:42.715 --> 00:42:48.647
It was brought to the United Nations. He brought this one, that one. He is a very big personality. He is the Director of the World Health Organization.

00:42:48.647 --> 00:42:54.081
Perhaps he would not have come just like that.

00:42:54.081 --> 00:43:01.805
And by coincidence – Sahaja – he got his Realisation. All these have to be seen with interest.

00:43:01.805 --> 00:43:05.006
There is no need to be such a slave of the watch.

00:43:05.006 --> 00:43:09.545
Ultimately, think about it that after being a slave of the watch for so long, what have we achieved?

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:15.645
It means that even our forefathers had worn watches, although their watches seldom used to work.

00:43:15.645 --> 00:43:23.859
By being tied to our watches, besides nervousness, we have not achieved anything more.

00:43:23.859 --> 00:43:33.956
And on account of slavery to this watch, what we have understood and what has emerged in this modern world is leukaemia.

00:43:33.956 --> 00:43:39.727
If you do not want to suffer from leukaemia, then say goodbye to the clock.

00:43:39.727 --> 00:43:44.081
Sometimes you keep the time forward and sometimes behind. I also do the same thing.

00:43:44.081 --> 00:44:01.427
Or keep just only one watch-hand. So when somebody asks, “What is the time?”, then say, “Half past” or “Quarter past.” OK.

00:44:01.427 --> 00:44:05.083
You can add the balance of the time to it. Think of any number you wish.

00:44:05.083 --> 00:44:13.892
Otherwise, there will be no time to enjoy.

00:44:13.892 --> 00:44:19.530
If you are always being a slave to the clock, where will be the time for you to enjoy?

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.048
“My friend, I don’t have the time for enjoyment.”

00:44:22.048 --> 00:44:29.248
But where are you going? To catch this, to catch that. You should stop running a race. Everybody is running like mad.

00:44:29.248 --> 00:44:36.763
In this way, women behave differently, and men also behave differently. But we have made our norms.

00:44:36.763 --> 00:44:41.679
Like, we have to go on time. I am not saying that this is wrong.

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:46.226
Now, English people had made this statement that by going on time they won the battle of Waterloo.

00:44:46.226 --> 00:44:50.498
But they could have lost, too. Being on time does not make any difference.

00:44:50.498 --> 00:44:53.301
When the time came, they won and lost.

00:44:53.301 --> 00:44:57.663
This does not mean that when the programme of Shri Mataji is at 6 o’clock, you can come at 9 o’clock.

00:44:57.663 --> 00:45:04.365
About this, a yogi is frustrated.

00:45:04.365 --> 00:45:07.856
Also Mr Verma.

00:45:07.856 --> 00:45:14.122
When Mother is giving Her speech, still they are coming. The wife, children, all are coming in line.

00:45:14.122 --> 00:45:20.523
Mother is speaking, and they all keep coming. So, it is said that the door of the Mother is not closed to anyone.

00:45:20.523 --> 00:45:26.961
But it is the Court of your Mother. It may be a door, but it is a Darbar (court of royalty). All are sitting.

00:45:26.961 --> 00:45:31.249
All [deities and ganas] are sitting, of whom we should be careful.

00:45:31.249 --> 00:45:35.064
You should know about this. They have come and gathered and are sitting here from even before I have come.

00:45:35.064 --> 00:45:37.514
They are sitting here, there and everywhere.

00:45:37.514 --> 00:45:41.713
That is why we should not take such liberties with Mother.

00:45:41.713 --> 00:45:44.683
We have to arrive before time.

00:45:44.683 --> 00:45:47.608
This is the work of God Almighty.

00:45:47.608 --> 00:45:56.190
You should come well prepared for the work of God Almighty. You should know about it. You should inculcate this discipline in yourself: “I am not going to do that”.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.298
When you get two-four smacks, you will realise and be all right again.

00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:01.848
You should arrive well before time.

00:46:01.848 --> 00:46:05.734
You should take responsibility. You are all responsible people.

00:46:05.734 --> 00:46:09.128
You should arrive on time. Teach your children also: “This is Mother’s programme.”

00:46:09.128 --> 00:46:13.025
It does not matter if you drink one less cup of tea; does not matter.

00:46:13.025 --> 00:46:16.293
“Come on, there is the programme of Mother.” It is a very big thing.

00:46:16.293 --> 00:46:22.598
That is why we should arrive before time. But I will not say anything. I have told these people to keep the door open.

00:46:22.598 --> 00:46:34.532
But you yourself have to understand, you yourself have to know, and you yourself have to have faith. You yourself have to handle it.

00:46:34.532 --> 00:46:40.126
Nobody is forced or punished, nor is there any kind of restriction in Sahaja Yoga from My side.

00:46:40.126 --> 00:46:45.824
But it somehow happens automatically, as you know.

00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:54.731
This discipline  automatically comes about in you. You are already getting the joy of the Kingdom of God Almighty.

00:46:54.731 --> 00:47:00.697
It is always there [Aadi], but the rules and regulations are also there simultaneously, and they are wonderful rules and regulations.

00:47:00.697 --> 00:47:11.874
That is why we have to prepare and present ourselves properly. We must humble ourselves and think that, “Today, we have to go to the Court of God.”

00:47:11.874 --> 00:47:15.916
You understand that people used to go previously to Delhi Darbar [Court of Viceroy of Delhi].

00:47:15.916 --> 00:47:20.266
You may be aware. So preparations used to start two months earlier. Special clothes used to be worn,

00:47:20.266 --> 00:47:31.571
there would be rehearsal as to how to go, and if you went, you were not allowed to show your back to the Viceroy. You had to bow and walk straight backwards.

00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:34.723
What is the might of this Viceroy?

00:47:34.723 --> 00:47:39.094
He was not even equal to the dust of the feet of God Almighty.

00:47:39.094 --> 00:47:44.248
Even less than that. There is nothing so great about him.

00:47:44.248 --> 00:47:50.177
So it may be only our Mother, but Her entire Court is full.

00:47:50.177 --> 00:47:56.253
And all those great Gods are sitting with discipline, laden with all their weapons.

00:47:56.253 --> 00:48:00.590
All the arrangements have been made. They are all standing. They have all come with full preparedness.

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:03.969
See, the vibrations have also come.

00:48:03.969 --> 00:48:06.571
What strong vibrations are flowing!

00:48:06.571 --> 00:48:11.736
They are all properly attired [Sajja] at this time. When I am speaking, see how strong the vibrations are coming.

00:48:11.736 --> 00:48:18.985
Therefore, you should also be alert. They are watching all of you, as to how you are all behaving.

00:48:18.985 --> 00:48:24.336
That is the reason you should be careful and come humbly.

00:48:24.336 --> 00:48:39.901
This you will understand gradually, as to where you have reached, what is your position, which state you are in.

00:48:39.901 --> 00:48:42.224
You start behaving according to that state.

00:48:42.224 --> 00:48:50.437
Recently, the marriage of the prince took place in London.

00:48:50.437 --> 00:48:54.462
People had come from far and wide. What a show [Tamasha] it was.

00:48:54.462 --> 00:49:04.352
But to attend, the wife of Mr. Reagan had come from America, and she was fifteen minutes late.

00:49:04.352 --> 00:49:09.666
She came running in. And the commentary of the people was that, “What will this lady understand?

00:49:09.666 --> 00:49:15.151
She was a model. Now she has become the wife of the President.” So what?

00:49:15.151 --> 00:49:19.224
What was really there has come into the open. What does she understand about rules?

00:49:19.224 --> 00:49:27.563
So, that is nothing at all. That is nothing at all.

00:49:27.563 --> 00:49:34.451
But you need to understand that what you have received is a big thing, it is such a height, and is so great.

00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:40.140
And as soon as you understand this greatness, you yourself will give special respect to this greatness.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.736
I am not going to put any restrictions on you.

00:49:43.736 --> 00:49:52.815
You only have to grow. And whoever grows by themselves, those who rise by themselves, will conduct themselves accordingly.

00:49:52.815 --> 00:49:54.395
We need not say anything to that person.

00:49:54.395 --> 00:49:58.353
If any growth takes place after telling someone, then it is not spontaneous [Sahaja].

00:49:58.353 --> 00:50:06.147
You, by your own sense [Samajhdhari] should rise, and gain greatness and self-respect.

00:50:06.147 --> 00:50:12.413
Your Self is awakened, and, being aware of that, you move forward.

00:50:12.413 --> 00:50:18.918
When you talk with each other, in your behaviour with others, in all this, the Self should manifest.

00:50:18.918 --> 00:50:22.514
Let owner-driven  be called self-driven.

00:50:22.514 --> 00:50:24.818
But the Self [Swa]) is missing in that.

00:50:24.818 --> 00:50:29.161
Your Self has been awakened. You go on in that path [tantra] of the Self.

00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:31.679
That is emancipation [Swatantra].

00:50:31.679 --> 00:50:43.535
And walking along on this path, you gain a special presence, and seeing that, the people will start thinking, “What is this that is so special coming before us?”

00:50:43.535 --> 00:50:49.596
This mad world requires this the most now.

00:50:49.596 --> 00:50:54.471
I need a little help from you.

00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:59.372
And if that happens, this world is going to change. It will change very fast.

00:50:59.372 --> 00:51:06.869
All of you get together and try. Give your best. Understand your greatness.

00:51:06.869 --> 00:51:10.292
A lot has been written about Shri Mataji’s greatness. Now you must write about your greatness.

00:51:10.292 --> 00:51:16.944
And understand, from where to where you people have reached, and where to where we have to reach.

00:51:16.944 --> 00:51:30.015
On New Year’s Eve, especially, I had to say, “Live joyfully, live comfortably, live peacefully, and be happy,” but  governed by your awakened Self.

00:51:30.015 --> 00:51:31.767
Never leave your awakened Self.

00:51:31.767 --> 00:51:40.435
That day is not far off, when you see that you people will enlighten the entire world.

00:51:40.435 --> 00:51:45.027
My eternal blessings to you all.
