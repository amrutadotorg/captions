00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.580
TC BC 2017-0317

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.200
So first of all we’ll start talking about energies.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.999
These energies are moving

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.879
within us and how they activate

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.200
and we’ll talk about the third energy

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.440
which is the one which has evolved us

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.680
and that’s how we are here.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.879
And we’ll talk about your Self, the controlling part,

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.999
which is controlling you, the Spirit.

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:46.879
So if you go on an abstract line,

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.560
it will be very appealing [?]  with it.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.879
Then afterwards, you see,

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.400
when we have talked about energies, this, that,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.640
once the people- that is within you- you see,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.600
sort of they’ll feel ego, this ego: “we have these energies

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.640
we can utilize these energies, do this, do that”

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.720
and then you’ll bring them down to Sahaja Yoga, later on.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.800
But to begin with, better talk of abstract.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:20.040
Because Indians are different, Western people are different,

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.879
they are fed up of religion, they are fed up of all this.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.999
So if you talk of religion, it gives, creates a problem.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.200
That’s why in the beginning, you see, Vedas, they were written down.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.680
They didn’t talk of God or Deities at all.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.800
They talked about God, God the Creator,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.400
but just about Brahmadeva,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.999
throughout Hiranyagarbha, Brahmadeva, right side they talked, you see.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.879
And the all thing is said, mantra is like :

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.999
“Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha”. 3 things. Now, Bhur is actually

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.680
the Mooladhara, is the earth upper it, the Mooladhara.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.879
Mooladhara chakra and Mooladhara itself.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:13.080
Then Bhuvah. Bhuvah is the one which is called the antariksha

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.879
[atmosphere, intermediate space], is the one which is all created,

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:20.760
in talks of Brahmadeva.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.680
Then swaha. Swaha is capacity to burn out,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.999
of the agny [fire] you see?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.879
It is so surprising and then they talk of mahatapa,

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:44.999
tapaha and maha. “Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha, maha tapa”.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.879
So when they talk of swaha, they talk of maha.

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:58.760
Maha is what you call the great, Allah Hou Akbar, and of tapa.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.440
Tapa is the one where you have to become a tapasuy,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.920
means a person who is going into penance, that of Christ.

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.640
And they say that you have to penetrate through the Surya,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.040
that is this. And the all thing is such an obstacle,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.040
and then you get your moksha.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.320
So they have talked of all the chakras.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.800
But if you talk about the abstract part of it,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.879
people have no objection, they listen to it,

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:36.999
listen as [inaudible] there’s no religion as such.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.040
Today specially I'm talking about the Vedas

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:50.800
and these havanas we do.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.999
When we do the havana it is a Yagnya.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.560
Yagnya means "by which you know". ‘nya’ means to know. Yagna.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.520
And this is done where you use 'Svaha' as the word.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.879
That means you use the principle of fire

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:25.400
to burn off all that is wrong in you, 'Svaha'.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.360
And you awaken it by taking the different names of the God.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.280
And it started at the time of Rama.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640
Today is Ram Navami.

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.120
I should say it was not started, we should say,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.280
but it was very much invoked when Rama lived

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.360
and they used to do Yagnyas at that time.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.879
The reason was, the people had just started realizing

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.999
that there is something higher

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.360
and you have to worship that higher Self, the seers said,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.999
and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagnyas.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.120
On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.879
and the dedication to God and all those things,

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.879
that is Bhakti , but mainly what they did

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:28.200
before Rama was the Yagnyas, the Vedas,

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.879
with which they prayed to different elements

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.879
- elements have made our chakras –

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:39.040
and tried to evoke the deities of the Elements.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.999
But actually it amounts to the same.

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:56.640
So as a child, Rama was studying with a very great saint,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.999
and when he was studying with him,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.200
Vashishta was the name of the great saint.

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:16.879
And Vashishta had an ashram where Rama and his brothers studied.

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.600
Shri Mataji to a lady: come along, come in, come forward.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.879
Give her a chair to sit down. Can you, is there a seat here?

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:28.400
I think Gavin can go, lots of seats are there.

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:49.160
Rama was studying with this Vashishta

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.400
and they used to come for holidays to father's place.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:04.879
Then, he had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow.

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.879
It’s called as ekabani. One arrow was sufficient of Sri Rama.

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:14.280
And he was a small little child, say about seven, eight years of age.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.999
And people were surprised how he could do it.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.160
So whenever they had a yagnya

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.760
– now these yagnyas were created to awaken, evoke, the Deities

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.320
inside the spinal chord – actually.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.879
And for these yagnyas they used to sit down

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:38.360
and do all these havanas the way we do it.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.760
But at that time, the rakshasas would come and try to spoil the yagnyas,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.920
because yagnyas are to be done with pure heart

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.640
and with cleanliness and with purity, it should not be insulted,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.879
there’s a protocol about it.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:58.879
While they thought that, “If we insult the Deities there,

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:02.879
then the Deities will disappear and their yagnyas will be spoiled.”

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:08.920
Now these yagnyas were done, in the olden times even, even when

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.440
Rama was not here. But at the time of Rama also,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.640
there were some rakshasas

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.280
who took a special pleasure in spoiling these yagnyas

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.680
and Rama as a child would go and protect them from the demons.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.879
And the demons would take some sort of a funny form

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:39.960
and come like invisible creatures and put some bones

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.879
of animals and things like that in the yagnya.

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:48.200
And that would spoil the effects of the yagnya.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.680
And Rama would protect that, as a child.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.560
Imagine, as a child he used to do that!

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.879
They would be doing the yagnya and he would be sitting outside

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:02.560
with all his small brothers around him

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.360
and they would kill the demons who would try to destroy the yagnyas.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:14.999
This is the early life of Rama in which you see

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:24.280
how, as a child also, he showed an amount of

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:34.879
expertise, you can say, in arrow and bow.

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:37.920
So any time you see a statue

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.920
– how to make out a Shri Rama’s statue, is to see if there’s an arrow

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.800
and a bow, then its a Rama’s statue.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.879
Now his coming on this Earth,   gave us the development of the Right Side

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.680
and so the yagnyas were also on the Right Side.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.760
Because first of all when human beings came on this Earth,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.999
they were frightened of all the animals who would invade them

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.640
and all kinds of horrible rakshasas and all those people,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.040
and negative forces they would trouble them.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:25.879
So, in that state they needed to create a king, a ruler,

00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:31.840
who was an ideal king and he would rule according to the laws of dharma.

00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:38.120
So He was the one in charge of that era,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.760
what we call as Satya Yuga you can say, but actually,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.800
He was here in Treta Yuga.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.879
That’s the time when He as here, that’s Treta Yuga,

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:55.080
and Krishna came at the lime of Dwapar Yuga.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.879
And today is the time, when I came it was Kali Yuga.

00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:05.960
But now, today, the time is of Krita Yuga,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.879
the Yuga where work will be done: ‘Krita’ means, “work will be done”.

00:11:10.999 --> 00:11:14.879
This is the time where work will be done.

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:17.400
So how things have moved from one to another?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.960
Now in the Dwapar Yuga when Shri Rama came,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:30.640
the idea of kingship and rulership started.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:43.120
So the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people.

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.879
The people had to have goodwill:

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:57.840
for the people and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity.

00:11:57.999 --> 00:12:00.879
The will, that is the Right Side.

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:04.280
So how to create the goodwill in people?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:11.080
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.520
in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.560
So the Right Side was created by the advent of Shri Rama

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:30.999
because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.999
that they should be ruled, that they should not be anarchist,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.840
there should be one head who should be able

00:12:41.999 --> 00:12:48.800
to organize, co-ordinate and work out a collective thing.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.999
You see, when we think of a king we want to oust him

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.999
because we don’t like the idea of being ruled someone.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.080
Because he’s not a good king perhaps, o

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.879
or he doesn’t represent that will of the people

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:14.879
which is a common will which creates this king

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:19.200
who rules for the maintenance of that goodwill.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.320
It is a symbolic expression of your goodwill.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.200
So when you create a law, it is also the expression,

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.520
common expression, of all the common people,

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.520
of the common feeling that they should abide with law.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:44.600
It doesn’t come to you that you are a slave,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.879
or you are to be dominated, or you have to be put down,

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:51.879
but it is only your common will, which is good.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:14:01.999
The desire of all the people which is the good, righteousness,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.040
incarnates as Shri Rama and He looks after that will.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.960
Because, supposing an individual may start saying that,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.999
“This is not good,” “This is not good.”

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.879
An individual might take a different attitude about things.

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:24.040
But you must have some symbol of that goodness

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.999
placed onto someone.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:35.879
And those symbols were created to symbolize your righteousness,

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:40.280
your sense of good, so that you can be saved yourself!

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.999
Supposing, today, somebody comes and hits you. Alright?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.640
Now you can feel how bad it is

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.680
to be hit by someone or murdered by someone,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.920
so you decide there should be a law protecting you.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.040
But tomorrow you may do the same thing.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.999
So what you do is to take out your goodwill,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:11.999
represent it as the kingdom or a king or a governing body.

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:18.400
So, the government as it is represents,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.999
should represent, also – in both ways.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.879
It’s not that it always represents.

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:27.360
It may not at all represent, may not, possibly.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.999
But, that the government itself should represent the good in you,

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.879
the purity in you, the pure will to be good, to be protected.

00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:45.440
And that you also should abide by it. It’s a very mutual thing.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.080
But what happens that, once you start electing someone like that,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.600
or making someone like that, or appointing someone like that,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.160
as usual, he goes into an ego trip.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.560
[It’s] a simple thing like that. It’s absolutely a simple ego trip.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.160
The government gets into an ego trip,

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.760
people get amazed how people behave.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.040
They’ll elect, supposing, a Prime Minister

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.879
and suddenly you find the Prime Minister behaves like a brute

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.280
and you can’t understand – “We have elected somebody

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.360
like a Prime Minister thinking that he will do the good to us.”

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.879
You see. It’s possible.

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:29.080
And then the revolutions take place while people revolt, fight it out.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.560
Again the will of the people fights it and makes it alright.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.800
So we have to have something absolute

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.879
because all these values are changing every moment.

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:51.872
Isn’t it? We think that this government did not do so well

00:16:51.993 --> 00:16:55.360
– for example, we think like that – so we want to demolish this government.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.699
Then we bring another one and we find the same thing happening.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:04.879
See, whether you bring a communist or you bring a socialist

00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:09.280
or you bring a democrat or you have a monarchy,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.999
whatever you may have!

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.800
But still, what happens actually is that,

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.040
all these things that come up and go away…

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.120
(aside: Gavin come here. Can you move forward a little bit so that everybody can be seated?)

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.999
All these changes that take place

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:39.680
go on creating a feeling in a man that we should be anarchist.

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:45.680
Why should we have any government? Why should we have any king?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.960
Why should [we] be ruled by anyone?

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.999
Because you find the person who’s ruling is not up to the mark

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.999
and he is just trying to deceive you.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.160
At that point you have to have some absolute standards.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.920
If you have an absolute standard then you can always judge

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.280
that this king is deviating from the right path,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.840
is not doing what a king should do.

00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:20.600
A king has to be like Rama. He has to be like Rama.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.320
Representing your will, your goodwill,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:33.040
your sense of proper judgement, fair play and righteousness.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.360
If the king is not righteous

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:41.600
then your collective goodwill will go against the king.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.680
Now you go and throwing one from another.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.680
Say, I’ve seen now for example in France:

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.600
We had one kind of a Prime Minister.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.879
He did lots of things which were not good so he was thrown away.

00:18:55.999 --> 00:18:57.879
So you had another one kind of one.

00:18:57.999 --> 00:19:00.600
Now he’s doing another thing, so he’s going to be thrown away.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.879
And we are just going, playing games you see.

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:06.040
First of all we have say, Labour Government. We don’t like it.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.680
So then we have another Government, Conservative Government.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.640
We don’t like it. Throw it away! Go on playing with it all the time.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.040
But in this relativity we are improving – definitely.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.879
We are more aware, understanding the value of these people,

00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:25.879
and also the public is understanding.

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:34.640
But then when too many such people come in who are negative,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.999
they also bring down the will, the collective will, very low.

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:47.920
And people start identifying themselves with these autocrats

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:54.840
or those people who are ego-orientated, who have no moral values,

00:19:54.999 --> 00:20:05.040
who have no fear of God, who deny religion,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.879
who deny evolution

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:13.560
and the Government starts behaving in such a manner

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.879
that you are amazed – how this is the Government?

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:19.840
Like in Chile and Argentina, the way the Government is behaving

00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:22.389
and is putting down the people.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.838
All these things are happening. You don’t know.

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:27.570
It’s such a relative terminology.

00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:30.760
Like El Salvador, you don’t know what to do over there now

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.879
– whom to support. Whether to support the Americans,

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.960
or to support the Russians and all that.

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.999
Now, under these circumstances a Sahaja Yogi can stand and say,

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.120
“Now, what to do? Should we join this or that?”

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.400
All is a wasteful thing. It’s just a game going on.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.879
Let them break their heads. They are good for nothing. Useless people.

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.280
So you cannot solve these problems

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.560
and you are not supposed to solve them.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.200
They must get their Realisation and establish the Kingdom of God.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:10.879
So [that] really Rama rules on this Earth

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:14.840
and not these horrible kings who change their morality every day,

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:16.879
who change their ideas every day,

00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:22.360
those whose will is sometimes for something materialistic.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.440
Like I would say now in our country (UK)

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.800
we thought that we’ll have Mrs. Thatcher.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.760
Good, very good, she’s coming up well I should say,

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.280
certain good things she is saying, like self-restraint and all that,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.360
those things she’s talking good things.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.200
But what about herself following this!

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.040
Shri Rama, not only propounded what was good but he followed that.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.879
He sacrificed for that and he established his own symbol

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:53.879
as a pure symbol of that righteous will,

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:59.040
that is within the people, which is the collective righteous will.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.960
Now, for example, you can see clearly

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.920
how the ego oriented things work out, first of all,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.280
by the misidentifications we can have.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.400
Now if you are a communist, you have to be out and out communist!

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.920
You cannot have compromise between democratic methods and communism.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.360
They can’t find any integration.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.200
They think  if you have to be this you have to be absolutely this.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.879
If you have to be that it has to be absolutely that.

00:22:21.999 --> 00:22:26.600
But, in Sahaja Yoga, what you find is both are integrated

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.640
because you have the complete capital and have now to distribute it.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.840
This is a complete integration here.

00:22:37.999 --> 00:22:42.200
All these ‘isms’ and all that are experiments of the artificial,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.680
of the mind, just a projection of the mind,

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.879
which is, whatever [is] man-made is artificial, you know that.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:50.879
But what is God made is all integrated.

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:57.680
That, whatever you have within yourself, you must give it to others.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.680
Now see for administration also, what happens after Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.400
Say, I am your Mother, here, sitting down.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:13.760
You like me to guide you. You like me to govern you.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.640
You like me to correct you, you like me to scold you

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.760
and to even go to a great extend to see that your life improves.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.280
Supposing I say, “Alright, I give up. I don’t want to trouble you!”

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.320
You will not like. None of you will like such a situation

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.360
where I say, “Alright you are a gone case,

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.320
I have nothing to do. You get out.”

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.879
Nobody will like such a situation. You want me to govern you.

00:23:39.999 --> 00:23:43.080
You want me to look after you. You like that.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.999
Automatically you have started liking it.

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:50.760
There’s no domination, but you want my domination.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.640
You want me to dominate you.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.600
You want that all my desire should be dominated – automatically.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.800
Why you feel that, “It is alright, it is very good

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.800
if Mother takes interest in me, corrects me. It’s a privilege”?

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.120
Why do you think like that?

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:13.880
Because by that there is a general good created.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.879
It’s a general good created in you.

00:24:16.999 --> 00:24:19.879
Because you have become integrated.

00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:29.760
Your body, your mind and your soul, all of them think the same way.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:33.560
They all want the same. There’s no difference.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.879
Once there is integration

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:38.999
you will find that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest way to live it.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.400
But if there is not, then it is no.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.879
For example, if you are a lazy person, say for example,

00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:47.440
or you are a very hot-tempered person

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:54.999
or you are a sort of a dual person,

00:24:55.999 --> 00:25:00.440
or you are playing tricks with yourself, you are playing games,

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.999
then you won’t like Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.999
As long as these situations are in you,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.640
you will not like Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.440
But once this situation is overcome, then you will like it

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:19.879
because then you will know that whatever is good for your Spirit

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:27.280
is for the well-being of you all and of all the people.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.360
Once this well-being comes in,

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.520
everyone feels absolutely nourished and fresh.

00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:43.999
So the governing part is enjoyable.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:47.879
The correction part is even more enjoyable.

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:52.800
And that you are in the attention of your Mother

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.120
is such a great feeling within yourself that,

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.999
“Yes. No, nothing will go wrong with me. She’ll look after me.”

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.280
“She’s there to look after me.”

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.680
But this integration part comes very late because of ego problems.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.600
You have built up egos because of

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.640
wrong type of people administering you.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.040
From your childhood you might have had bad parents

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.680
who never talked of God, of good things of life.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.879
They themselves did not lead a life of sacrifice.

00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:28.760
Very self indulgent parents can create a problem like that.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.840
They never gave you the right type of life,

00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:34.879
a proper value system which should have been there.

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:39.879
They never educated how to enjoy righteousness, virtues, in life.

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:43.520
Possibly, later on, the country in which you are born,

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.080
the other people who surround you also might have done that.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.879
Also, your government, whichever you have known, must have done that.

00:26:51.999 --> 00:26:56.879
So when these things change, when you find that you have achieved

00:26:56.999 --> 00:26:59.520
that kind of integration within you:

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.879
that whatever your body likes is good for your Spirit also.

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:08.879
Like say for example, I don’t like certain things myself.

00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:12.520
I don’t like drinks, I don’t like it.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.879
I just don’t like it. Nobody can tempt me.

00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:17.879
I mean, no question of temptation, I just don’t like.

00:27:17.999 --> 00:27:21.320
I will hate the things which are really bad for my Spirit

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.160
– automatically. I don’t have to tell myself, it’s just there.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:32.080
To tell lies I don’t like because it harms me there. I don’t like it.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.879
Whatever is good for your Spirit will automatically work out

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:38.280
as soon as this integration takes place

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.800
and this is the work of Sahaja Yoga today.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.360
That’s why I said it is Krita Yuga, is to be done.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.840
And this integration must be achieved within ourselves.

00:27:49.999 --> 00:27:54.600
So sometimes you have to make your body come to this level.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.440
Maybe you are under the influence of some bhoots

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.999
your body doesn’t help you.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.840
Little bit of tapasvita, or penance,

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:06.920
is needed after Sahaja Yoga to make this possible.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.999
And then once you start enjoying it then you like it.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.560
Like driving a car – in the beginning it’s difficult.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.879
Or swimming, anything,

00:28:17.999 --> 00:28:20.840
when you try to do it’s rather difficult in the beginning.

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.760
If I say, “You forget it now, whatever

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.879
you have done in the past you forget it now

00:28:24.999 --> 00:28:27.200
get to the new things now. You have to do it.”

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:34.680
So you have to put your mind to it with all your full zest.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:38.360
That, “Alright, if my body’s not helping me – alright –

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.600
then I’ll try to improve the body because I’m not the body.”

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.879
“If my mind is not helping me, I must improve my mind.

00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:51.400
If my intellect is standing in the way

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.680
I’ll have to put my intellect right

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.320
because after all I have to be integrated.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.879
If I am not integrated I’m not going to enjoy anything

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:03.879
nor am I going to do anything good to myself or to others.

00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:07.640
So why am I here? Why am I trying to destroy myself?”

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.879
But when you are disintegrated, you will be surprised.

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:14.640
your one action will destroy your second action

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.120
and second action will destroy third action – when you are disintegrated.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.080
I’ll give you an example: Supposing now I am sitting here

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.879
and somebody tells me that this will burn you.

00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:31.872
This is my own maya. But the body wants to burn itself.

00:29:31.993 --> 00:29:35.040
It says, “No, alright, don’t listen to this, just burn itself.”

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.560
Now, when I say this it sounds absurd.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.880
But, say, the mind says you should not take to alcohol,

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:49.040
but still you’ll go to the pub, then you are disintegrated.

00:29:49.999 --> 00:29:52.879
Gradually once you start listening to your body too much,

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:55.879
your mind just gives in. It just gives in.

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:59.040
In every thing that you do, if you are integrated,

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.160
you will be amazed that you will really become dynamic.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.960
Integration is nothing but your complete connection with your Spirit.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.280
The Spirit starts flowing into it.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.879
In every walk of life you will be amazed how dynamic you’ll become

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:18.880
if you are integrated.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:27.879
Just the connection is to be absolutely achieved with your Spirit.

00:30:27.999 --> 00:30:29.680
Whenever you think of something,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.999
“Is it good for my Spirit?”

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:39.999
Some people have a habit of thinking that spiritual life is such

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.640
that you hang by the shoestring somewhere, in the air

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.999
and there is no connection to the day to day life.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.879
So many people think like that.

00:30:49.999 --> 00:30:53.960
They think such a man should be a thin, miserable creature

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.760
hanging onto some tree or something

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:06.879
and should be absolutely in a paranoid state or something.

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:09.600
That he is frightened of the whole world;

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.400
who cannot talk to anyone,

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.879
who is so much exclusive that he becomes a recluse.

00:31:16.999 --> 00:31:20.879
These absurd ideas should to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:20.999 --> 00:31:26.080
You have to be very much there, absolutely there between all of them.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.879
But something: you should be rare, a different type,

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:30.879
a unique personality.

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:34.640
You are to be there with all these things that are going on.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.879
Now people are frightened, you know, even of Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:40.879
They are frightened of Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:43.360
[If] they see somebody negative, they [say],

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.560
“Oh, this thing, that thing.” Now take a fight with that person.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.080
Take a fight. “How could you dare to do this, such a thing?

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.999
You are a Sahaja Yogi! Come up! What do you mean by this?”

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.080
You have to fight it out.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.400
As long as possible you should try to salvage a person,

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.760
talk to him in that manner.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.680
The other side of it is that when you talk to others,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.879
when they come to you, then there has to be a kind

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:18.920
of a tremendous sincerity within you.

00:32:19.816 --> 00:32:21.696
If you are doing with that sincerity

00:32:21.817 --> 00:32:24.079
people will know you are doing with sincerity.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.640
When you talk to a person they should know there’s sincerity

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.360
your heart is there.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.680
For example, you may talk to that person very sweetly,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.628
but your heart may not be there and the person might think,

00:32:36.749 --> 00:32:38.990
“Oh, he’s just seeking elections.”

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.600
Alright? But if you talk to someone with the sincerity you’ll say,

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.879
“How could you do such a thing? Can’t you see yourself?

00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:51.160
Can’t you work it out? That’s what it is. You are here for that.”

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:57.840
Now in saying so, your sincerity, which is coming from your heart,

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.840
is to be seen, and that’s what is Shri Rama’s character is:

00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:07.080
that he was on the right side of the heart,

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.520
means the heart put to activity.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.560
Do you understand that, where Kabira has said,

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.080
“Mana mamata ko thira kara Lau.”

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:28.840
“I will make my compassion of my heart – mana – from my heart,

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:33.360
the compassion, make it steady. “aur pancha hi tattva milau,”

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.760
“and put them into five elements.”

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.879
You see, in the same way, when you are in the left heart,

00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:44.040
that’s your sincerity. It’s your heart-felt thing.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.320
But the heartfelt thing, what’s the use?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.080
You see, there are many Sahaja Yogis who really feel,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.040
this world is horrible and something must be done,

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.160
Sahaja Yoga must be brought in.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:00.400
But how many of you are really putting that to action?

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:05.999
Absolutely into action?

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.999
Without that, your Rama’s tattwa cannot be improved.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.960
Rama’s tattwa is only improved when

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:19.520
you put all the things into action that exactly Shri Rama did.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.560
So in the ascent of man, when he came up to Rama’s place,

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.920
the advent of Rama was not in the centre, but on the right-hand side.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.879
He moved aside. So much so, that he forgot about his past.

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:36.879
He’s never mentioned that He’s an incarnation.

00:34:36.999 --> 00:34:39.600
He never told His father. He never told his mother.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.999
He never told anybody that He was an incarnation.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.640
Of course it was evident that he was.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:53.360
His brother knew about it. Now he had two brothers.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.600
Very interesting. I mean he had other brothers also,

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.600
but Bharat and another was Lakshmana.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.640
These two brothers were with him.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.080
Now they show the two sides of a human being.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.879
One was Lakshmana and he was that fiery type, you see.

00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:13.879
He couldn’t bear anybody misbehaving towards Rama.

00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:19.879
He couldn’t bear anybody talking in a very mundane type to Shri Rama.

00:35:19.999 --> 00:35:23.999
And he used to get so angry with all these people

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.360
that he would just come out like a big thunderbolt

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.520
on anybody who tried to say anything about Shri Rama.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.040
Even Parashurama, who was there,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.960
a contemporary incarnation of Shri Rama Himself was Parashurama.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.360
It’s a very interesting story about that.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.800
But, he could not bare Parashurama in any way…

00:35:49.999 --> 00:35:51.999
(break in recording)

00:35:54.999 --> 00:35:58.999
…He is the Shesha as they call it.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:06.040
The serpent which sleeps in the bhavasagara.

00:36:06.999 --> 00:36:09.879
On which Shri Vishnu rests.

00:36:09.999 --> 00:36:13.440
The same Shesha had taken birth as Shri Lakshmana.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.160
Now for a western mind, to them, snakes are sort of…

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.560
if you talk about snakes for them, only they know

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.560
the Adam and Eve snake that’s all,

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.200
they don’t understand anything.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.640
And they can’t understand why people worship snakes.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.760
You see, snakes are, like cobra and all that, they are like the kings.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.400
They are the kings of the underground.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:44.640
And Shesha is the one who supports the whole Universe.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.879
So this Shesha is worshipped

00:36:46.999 --> 00:36:50.920
as the cobras are worshipped in many villages in India, even today,

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.680
because they don’t trouble anyone there.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.520
Because they are like deities, are worshipped in India.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:04.280
And sometimes they do, but mostly they do not bite a good religious man.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.520
There’s a story of Sai Nath

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:17.200
where a snake charmer

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.560
was given a lot of money just to kill Shri Sai Nath.

00:37:22.999 --> 00:37:25.840
And because Sai Nath, used to, in the night,

00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:30.200
suddenly goes up to his own swing he had made,

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.400
about thirty feet above the ground.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.120
God knows, nobody knew how he used to go there.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.960
But they would find him sleeping up there. (Laughs).

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:45.280
So this snake was taken by this snake charmer

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.120
and he put the snake on to Sai Nath.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.400
And the snake went there, and Sai Nath talked to him and He said,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.320
“Oh God, you’ve come here to meet me after such a long time.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.920
What is your job?”

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.879
He said, “This horrible snake charmer has asked me to bite you.

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:07.879
So I’ve come to tell you to be careful about these people.”

00:38:07.999 --> 00:38:12.160
The snake charmer was looking with amazement that he was talking to him!

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.680
He said, “Alright, you go now.” He talked to him.

00:38:14.811 --> 00:38:16.879
These are age-old snakes, you see.

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:21.440
So the snake went and bit the snake charmer.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.800
But then he came down you see, from his thing,

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.880
and he sucked his poison and threw it away.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.999
“Because, after all, you see,” he said, “the snake is angry with you

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.480
because you tried such a trick.” So he sucked in.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.879
That’s compassion. That’s compassion.

00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:44.840
And he sucked his venom out and the fellow was completely changed

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:48.879
and he said, “Now I’m going to announce it to all the people

00:38:48.999 --> 00:38:53.160
what, these brahmins tried to kill,”

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.359
that they wanted to kill Shri Sai Nath.

00:38:56.479 --> 00:38:58.959
And why? Why were they so frightened of this man?

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.520
He used to live outside the village

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.840
and they were so frightened of him because they were doing all wrong things

00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:09.999
in the name of God. So they were all frightened that they’ll be exposed.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.920
So, this is what it is, that He sleeps on the Shesha.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:19.200
And Shesha is the one who is sometimes expressed in Sahaja Yogis,

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.879
I have seen, as anger, when you try to be non protocolish

00:39:24.999 --> 00:39:29.760
or when you try to be funny or you don’t behave yourself.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.640
That’s the Shesha in them.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.560
That is also sometimes needed.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.960
You have to be a Shesha sometimes because

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.080
otherwise people will start misbehaving

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.160
and by that they will be harmed.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.879
Not that I will be harmed, but they will be harmed.

00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:46.280
So that kind of temperament is also needed.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.440
But the other one is very interesting, is that of Bharata, the brother.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.640
He showed how Shri Rama bestowed the kingdom to him

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.960
because of his mother’s agitation.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:05.520
And he didn’t know what to do.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.760
So he went back to Rama and he said that, “You take back your kingdom.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.800
I don’t want anything. You are the one who should govern.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.999
Why should I have it?”

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.960
So Rama said, “Alright, you just be there in charge of the kingdom.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.280
I have to obey my father, I have to obey my mother

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.320
because I have given them a promise.”

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:34.280
So Shri Rama’s another great quality was once given a promise

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.800
is to be kept.

00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:39.360
This is another quality we have to have that,

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.999
if you have promised anything, you have to keep it.

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:47.800
If you have said, “I will do this,”, you must do it.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.200
You should not find out excuses to avoid it.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.600
It’s absolutely an anti-God activity to avoid doing

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.760
things that you have promised.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.800
Your Deities will never be happy.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.999
You must see that, whatever you have promised you must do.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.879
Now, when Bharata was sent back by Him

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:13.960
he said, “Alright, give me your sandals which I’ll take there.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.879
And I’ll use them as if that’s the symbol of you being there.”

00:41:19.999 --> 00:41:22.320
And he put those sandals on the throne

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.400
and he ruled that kingdom and looked after – Bharata.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.760
Though when he was going to see Rama

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.200
then Lakshmana saw him coming and he said, “Look at this!

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.879
He’s coming here to invade you now! He has thrown you out of the kingdom

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:38.840
and now he’s coming to invade you.”

00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:41.800
So this is also, I’ve seen, among Sahaja Yogis, is there,

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.640
that the Sahaja Yogis who are like Shesha

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.960
cannot see also the goodness of other Sahaja Yogis

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:55.080
who are very good people, extremely sacrificing, nice people

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.360
but their intentions are not understood, are misunderstood,

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.040
which is a very sad thing.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.800
You must see the intentions of another type of people also,

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.879
who may not be so hot tempered, may not be so much angry

00:42:08.999 --> 00:42:11.520
but their intentions are very good.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.999
They have come actually to ask for the sandals of Shri Rama.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.520
So among this two type of people, I have seen

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.440
there is always a misunderstanding going on.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.520
So both the types of people should try to understand

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.640
that we both are needed for Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.879
I cannot only do with one type of people.

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:35.920
We have to have both types of people

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.680
who will look after both the styles of the thing.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.840
But when you are dealing with others one should go as one.

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:51.879
For example, if a person is coming to Caxton Hall

00:42:51.999 --> 00:42:54.600
and he says something

00:42:55.999 --> 00:42:59.879
then you should weigh it whether he’s a new one or an old one.

00:42:59.999 --> 00:43:03.920
If he’s a new one then you must show all gentleness, kindness,

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.280
all kinds of exterior things which will please him.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.480
The reason is: he’s not a realised soul,

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.200
he doesn’t see your subtle thing.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.879
What he sees is what you are, outside.

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:21.400
How you are dressed, how you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.680
All these things they see first of all.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.879
They don’t see what you have got inside.

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:30.840
They can’t see your heart, they can’t feel your vibrations,

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.560
so you have to be very kind to them, you have to be very sweet to them.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.360
I received a letter from someone saying that “The Sahaja Yogis

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.760
have been very, very rude to me and have been angry.”

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.040
Like the other day, somebody came and was sitting at the back:

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.200
they are trying to salvage, salvage what you call

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.920
the people who are lost by the cults or whatever it is.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.999
He was sitting at the back and when I said, “Come forward.”

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.560
And and he didn’t come so you said, “You get out!”

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:03.320
You should not say! Let me say. That time you should keep quiet.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.879
Nobody should say, “Get out! If you are not going.”

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:11.280
Because the thing is if we say,

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.879
“We don’t care for people who are not humble!”

00:44:13.999 --> 00:44:16.440
Then they are going to be lost in any case.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.120
Let us give them a fair chance.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:22.320
Let us give them a fair chance to come into Sahaja Yoga;

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.879
first by your behaviour.

00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:28.879
Now, some people have a habit of, sort of talking to them

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:33.160
a bit too much. They should not talk. That’s one thing I feel,

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.520
that, while giving vibrations and all that,

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:44.160
at the most you should ask, “Are you feeling any cool breeze?”

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.720
in a very humble way. And this is another quality of Shri Rama,

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.560
is a sankoch. There’s no word in English language

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.520
because you have ‘formality’

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.079
which is a very insipid word to describe ‘ ‘sankoch’.

00:44:58.199 --> 00:45:01.800
Because, there is no integration between your heart and formality.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.640
But if you can think of a ‘formality of the heart’

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.640
then what do you call that?

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.199
What will you call in English language?

00:45:15.199 --> 00:45:18.240
The formality of the heart.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.480
Yogini: Sincerity.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.199
Shri Mataji: No, sincerity is different. It’s an action.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:31.079
Sincerity is an abstract thing. But formality, from the heart.

00:45:31.199 --> 00:45:35.199
You see, how to say such a thing?

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.199
Yogini: ‘Honestly’ Mother. ‘Honestly’.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:46.079
Shri Mataji: No, no. Not ‘honesty’. These are all abstract words.

00:45:46.199 --> 00:45:48.079
In action.

00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:51.079
You see, say for example, now, I am sitting.

00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:54.199
Now if they bring me a cup, alright?

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.079
It’s a broken cup, for example, you go to somebody’s house,

00:45:57.199 --> 00:45:59.000
and it’s a little broken.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.800
So, if an Indian is there -I don’t know about Western style

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.720
– he will drink it off.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.320
He will not say anything, “It’s broken,” or anything.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.800
But maybe somebody might say, “It’s a broken cup!”

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.560
Or say, you go to somebody’s house

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:22.040
and you don’t like a colour scheme or something.

00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:27.079
So for an Indian person it would be not proper

00:46:27.199 --> 00:46:33.360
to immediately say like that – for an Indian person.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.840
You see, “formality of the heart”.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.199
Not to say something in such a way that

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:49.600
you touch the wrong side of the person is sankoch.

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.560
Now to such an extent Shri Rama had that there’s a good story

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.079
– I think I had said it before also, but again I’ll repeat it to you –

00:46:58.199 --> 00:47:02.560
which is described in another Ramayana written by Tulsidasa.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.079
Although Tulsidasa was not a Realised soul,

00:47:05.199 --> 00:47:08.000
but some points he has brought out very well.

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.079
He says that:

00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:19.400
Shri Rama was putting the arrows

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.400
against the heads of Ravana.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.040
And he had ten heads. And he had a boon that,

00:47:30.199 --> 00:47:33.079
every head that falls off, another head will come up.

00:47:33.199 --> 00:47:35.800
He had a boon like that. So his brother says,

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.520
“What are you doing? You know that he cannot die

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.880
by putting the arrows across his head.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.880
You have to put it in his heart otherwise he will not die.”

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.079
So the sankocha comes in Him and He said,

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:52.960
“See, in his heart he has got my wife

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.840
because he loves Her and She’s sitting in his heart.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.840
How can I hit him in the heart? She’ll be hurt.”

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.120
See the delicacy of his understanding.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.240
So he said, “Then by hitting his head is he going to be killed?”

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:12.079
He said, “You see, attention, once it going towards his head,

00:48:12.199 --> 00:48:15.199
his attention will be withdrawn from his heart.

00:48:15.388 --> 00:48:17.190
And once the attention is withdrawn,

00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:19.520
my wife will not be there any more,

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:23.120
then Ill hit him and I’ll kill him.”

00:48:24.199 --> 00:48:27.040
So see, the sankoch! You see, then you will understand that

00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:30.000
how we are rude and arrogant.

00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:40.280
This kind of arrogance and rudeness comes to us because we have no sankoch.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.979
We should not say everything to everyone. We need not.

00:48:45.099 --> 00:48:49.525
Should we say everything? Say, for example, in your puja

00:48:49.646 --> 00:48:52.566
maybe you are doing something which should not be done.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.620
I know it’s wrong. Unless and until it’s absolutely wrong,

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.979
I will not tell. I said, “Gradually they will learn.”

00:48:58.099 --> 00:49:01.020
Because otherwise you become like this, you see, tensed up.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:07.420
You must see Linda’s face if I tell her anything! She goes into…

00:49:07.899 --> 00:49:13.740
So that sankocha, that understanding comes if you love someone

00:49:13.899 --> 00:49:16.899
and understand. Now, you have to love all the seekers of the world.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.779
They have done wrong, they have done all kinds of ego-trips,

00:49:19.899 --> 00:49:22.899
they have done all kinds of mistakes but your Mother loves them

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.420
and you have to love them.

00:49:25.899 --> 00:49:28.940
If they are to be corrected I’ll do that.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.779
You just don’t do that way that they feel hurt.

00:49:31.899 --> 00:49:34.100
Put a sankocha.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.779
While talking to each other educate yourself,

00:49:37.899 --> 00:49:43.899
train yourself to say things which are sweet and nice,

00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:48.779
which will make another person feel

00:49:48.899 --> 00:49:53.779
that this person is a properly brought up person

00:49:53.899 --> 00:49:55.340
in Sahaja Yoga tradition.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.779
So we have a Sahaja Yoga tradition also,

00:49:57.899 --> 00:50:00.420
in which, when we speak to each other,

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:04.100
we have that sankocha within us of Shri Rama.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.260
And if you do not have that sankocha

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.779
you get the Right Heart.

00:50:08.899 --> 00:50:14.420
And that Right Heart is a very dangerous thing in a country like England,

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.220
where the climate is so bad,

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:21.700
because it gives you a horrible thing like asthma.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:26.060
I’m not frightening you, but it’s true.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.779
You get asthma if your Right Heart is caught.

00:50:29.899 --> 00:50:32.460
Not necessarily that asthma comes from Right Heart only

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.309
– can also come from centre heart –

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.779
but [if] you get Right Heart you definitely get asthma.

00:50:38.899 --> 00:50:42.500
So the attitude you see, like your father.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:46.100
I’ve heard people talking to father also in such a funny way.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.660
You can’t talk to your father like that.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.420
They talk to me also very rudely.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.540
I mean, I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis, shockingly sometimes

00:50:54.700 --> 00:51:00.340
– on a very mundane level or you can say in a very unprotocolish way.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.500
you will get into Right Heart.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.060
So this sankoch one has to learn,

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:10.180
the maryada: means the boundaries of your relationships.

00:51:10.301 --> 00:51:12.580
You see, “we love each other,” doesn’t mean

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:17.779
that we go on aggressing other’s privacies.

00:51:17.899 --> 00:51:21.260
To what extent you love each other doesn’t mean

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:25.180
that you go on in way that you try to transgress

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.580
all the beauties and all the privacies of another person.

00:51:30.899 --> 00:51:33.860
You see, [if] someone walks into the bedroom directly

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:37.180
is not the way Sahaja Yoga should be. I need not tell.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.860
But you must knock if you have to.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.779
And knock at a time when you need it!

00:51:40.899 --> 00:51:45.980
All the time to knock or to hang onto someone all the time is not proper.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.220
The sankocha is a complete cultural stuff.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:57.660
So we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Shri Ram.

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:01.340
He’s known for his sankocha. Every time, how to say this,

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:07.340
I cannot say that. We have this very much engrained within us.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.540
The children are to be educated in that way,

00:52:12.661 --> 00:52:17.061
and once they are educated that way they will learn the sankoch,

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:24.220
and that will give them a proper understanding of social life.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.740
Like you now see, this light is here: if you put your finger to it,

00:52:28.899 --> 00:52:31.020
it might burn and you may remove your finger.

00:52:31.141 --> 00:52:33.540
But if you are with another person

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.940
and if you try to take liberties with that person

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.580
a day may come when that person will misbehave

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.340
or will harm you or do something to you. But still you will not realise

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.580
[that] it is because you have no sankoch [that] it has happened.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:52.779
So this sankoch has to be worked out very beautifully in every way:

00:52:52.899 --> 00:52:56.980
in thanks-giving, in accepting some body’s gratitude,

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.260
in expressing your love to another person

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.820
– in a way that is a sankoch.

00:53:05.899 --> 00:53:10.260
Now Shri Rama is known for his boundaries.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:15.220
He doesn’t cross the limit. Yesterday, the other day I told you about

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.580
food, that you don’t cross the boundaries of food,

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.020
like being compassionate to the bugs and to the mosquitoes.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:29.779
In the same way in every thing discretion of the heart should be there.

00:53:29.899 --> 00:53:34.180
Now, there is no word for “discretion of the heart”

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.460
in the English language, which is maryada.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:47.420
Discretion of the heart is, to understand, say, example,

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.540
that if you are rude to your father what do you gain?

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:54.180
You gain nothing. But if you are humble you might gain over,

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.779
with your father alright. Even if he’s a bad man!

00:53:58.899 --> 00:54:02.779
Because what happens in reaction, if you say psychologically:

00:54:02.899 --> 00:54:07.779
Supposing you are the son of a father who is doing something wrong

00:54:07.899 --> 00:54:10.779
and you are obedient to him,

00:54:10.899 --> 00:54:15.980
he will always have a fear that he will lose you if he falls in your ideals.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:21.060
So by that humility you will raise him.

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.940
If you are humble, if your behaviour towards your parents

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:31.060
is like Shri Rama’s, there’s nothing to lose.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:34.779
You don’t compromise in your principles or anything.

00:54:34.899 --> 00:54:38.220
In day to day things, like that, [if] your father is sitting…

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.340
I mean in India if the father is there,

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.047
you won’t sit down before him, you won’t sit, at any cost.

00:54:44.168 --> 00:54:47.101
Till he tells you ten times, you won’t sit before him.

00:54:47.222 --> 00:54:50.779
It helps, you know. Then it reacts on the father

00:54:50.899 --> 00:54:54.980
that,  “Supposing I misbehave much my son will not respect me.”

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.899
So the sense of respect also comes from your heart.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:07.260
That’s only possible if you know that maryada from your heart

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:10.779
how far to go. What is the need to be rude to your father?

00:55:10.899 --> 00:55:14.740
No need at all, at any cost! What is the need?

00:55:14.899 --> 00:55:17.220
Or to your husband or to your wife?

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.899
Why to say anything harsh to anyone? What is the need?

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.300
What are you going to gain out of it?

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.420
By saying anything harsh I have not seen people have improved.

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:29.580
Only when a guru is harsh or,

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:32.899
I mean, the mother or father are harsh to the children it helps.

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.700
Nowhere else it helps you in common relationships.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:42.100
Like brothers and sisters, it does not, and higher and lower.

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:45.340
The lower person have to bear the harshness of the elders

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.428
if they want to improve. There’s nothing!

00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:49.990
After all they’re not going to throttle you.

00:55:50.111 --> 00:55:53.220
Supposing even if he says something bad to you – doesn’t matter.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.779
You try to. And there, what one has to remember [is]

00:55:55.899 --> 00:55:59.899
what Christ has said that, you must put another cheek.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:05.020
So use the heart’s discretion – how far to go to a person.

00:56:05.899 --> 00:56:10.260
In the effect of it you will be a very, very powerful person,

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.740
in your family, in Sahaja Yoga, anywhere.

00:56:14.899 --> 00:56:19.860
Those people who are obedient to me are very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.899
You know that.

00:56:22.899 --> 00:56:26.460
And those who are not go down very fast.

00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.779
I try to save them, by everything, but I have seen

00:56:30.899 --> 00:56:34.300
– those who are disobedient, who don’t listen to me,

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.420
who are rude to me, who do not understand the protocol,

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:39.500
go down very much in Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.779
Absolutely (clicking fingers) like that!

00:56:41.899 --> 00:56:48.460
In a second I find they are going hundreds of feet down. It’s true.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.779
Because what is lacking in you is the discretion, the maryada

00:56:52.899 --> 00:56:56.500
– how far to go. And that’s another thing we have to learn

00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:58.180
to educate ourselves.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:02.340
So the education of Shri Rama as it was, I told you, that

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.779
he could kill a demon with one arrow.

00:57:05.899 --> 00:57:09.100
You don’t have to beat them a hundred and eight times,

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.899
one beating should be sufficient.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.740
But you have to be powerful people

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:20.220
and the power of a person increases by putting maryada.

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:24.779
Supposing you have wheat, and you just spread it,

00:57:24.899 --> 00:57:28.779
it will spread all over, anybody will, birds will come and eat it off,

00:57:28.899 --> 00:57:32.660
it will be finished. But if you put them in a sack

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:39.420
it will have a weight, it will have a size, it will rise in height

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.860
and it is useful. It will have respect.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:46.820
But the thing that is all spread all over, which has no maryada,

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.779
will never be respected.

00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:54.740
Nothing works out without maryada. Even the light keeps to a maryada.

00:57:54.899 --> 00:57:59.820
You have to keep your maryadas. That is part of our training, you see.

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:02.980
Say, for example, an aeroplane is there

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.820
and it is not bound by any maryadas.

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.940
You see, it is not bound. When it goes in the air

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:10.899
it will be all finished!

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:17.660
All our ideas of freedom are to be bound by maryada.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.340
If the freedom has no maryada it is abandonment,

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:25.020
it is nonsense, it is not going to help us.

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.779
So we have to create out of Sahaja Yogis great politicians.

00:58:29.899 --> 00:58:34.940
It has been predicted that if Sahaja Yoga does not spread

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.300
then the third world war is inevitable.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.740
People will suffer a lot with a third world war.

00:58:41.899 --> 00:58:48.260
It is possible to avoid it if people take to Sahaja Yoga in a big number.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.700
But if they do not, there will be a third world war

00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.779
and the effects of that will harm people so much

00:58:54.899 --> 00:58:59.020
that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:01.300
and not the diplomats.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:03.540
The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted,

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.380
and they will decide what is to be done for the world

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:10.779
and they will become the rulers of tomorrow’s world.

00:59:10.899 --> 00:59:16.180
So we must have a full idea [of] how to be rulers like Shri Rama.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:20.740
We have to go too far with ourselves, to training up ourselves,

00:59:20.899 --> 00:59:23.860
educating ourselves, getting rid of our egos

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.180
and understanding that we have to grow.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:31.779
It’s a very big task, it’s a great task and sometimes you might think,

00:59:31.899 --> 00:59:34.340
“How can Mother expect us to do it?”

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:37.020
But I think you are the people who are chosen for it

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.580
and you have to get to it and work it out.

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:43.779
So we have to train up ourselves to be first good rulers of ourselves

00:59:43.899 --> 00:59:45.779
and the rulers of others.

00:59:45.899 --> 00:59:48.198
First we must learn to rule ourselves. You see,

00:59:48.319 --> 00:59:53.020
here in this body only you’ll learn how to rule yourself.

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:55.980
Comfort, if you get fond of comfort,

00:59:56.100 --> 01:00:00.899
make your body work it out that there’s no comfort needed.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.020
If your body indulges into too much eating or anything,

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.540
make your body learn that it’s not good to indulge into it.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.340
If you speak too much, talk too much, if you are rude,

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.779
just say that, “I’m not going to say a word from morning till evening.”

01:00:14.899 --> 01:00:19.660
Take to mauna (silence). So the tapah, is the penance time,

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.220
is now ahead of us.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.820
With that penance, the greatest thing that is going to help you

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:32.460
is to go and talk of Sahaja Yoga – give the message of my advent –

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:37.300
and also talk about how the transformation, the blossom time has come.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:42.260
This you have to do, plus you have to learn how to rule yourself

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.427
and then how to rule others through your heart, not through your mind.

01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:49.933
You have to rule through your hearts by learning all the qualities

01:00:50.054 --> 01:00:52.540
of the heart which I have told you.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.420
And I must congratulate you for the article you have written on Blossom Time.

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.340
I have gone through it. I have really enjoyed it, thoroughly.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.460
He’s done very well. May God bless you!

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.660
And I think it will have a good [effect]…

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.500
I’m surprised how they published it:

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.580
have they changed their mind or what happened?

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.779
It’s amazing! Have you seen that article?

01:01:11.899 --> 01:01:13.500
It’s great.

01:01:17.899 --> 01:01:23.060
And thank you very much for the nice creepers you have sent me.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.779
They are so beautiful you see, they still are under a shock

01:01:26.899 --> 01:01:30.300
because I removed them from your gentle care to mine.

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.980
And mine is a little sort of flippant one now.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.260
But today we tried to do some justice to them.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:39.060
I’m sure they’ll. We gave them a bandhan.

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:45.300
Shri Mataji: You mean you want to be more intelligent?

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.779
Yogi: No, to get rid of the rubbish Mother.

01:01:47.899 --> 01:01:50.300
Shri Mataji: Rubbish that is in the head?

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.740
You see, the best one, in Sanskrit it is said,

01:01:52.899 --> 01:01:55.779
“Ya neti neti wachane nigamor avochus.”

01:01:55.899 --> 01:02:00.020
means, you go on telling your mind, “This is not, this is not, this is not.”

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.860
Any thought that comes to your mind, you go on telling,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.940
“this is not the thought. Not this, not this, not this.”

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.220
Then the inspiration starts coming.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.020
You see, what I feel, people are not inspired.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:18.060
They have got fear on one side.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.779
Suddenly, you do something to them they go into a fear, a trauma.

01:02:21.899 --> 01:02:27.100
Or else, if you try to be good to them, they go into an ego-trip.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.779
So to stay in the centre, what you have to do,

01:02:29.899 --> 01:02:32.779
is to go on saying “Not this thought,” and, “not this thought.”

01:02:32.899 --> 01:02:36.220
Then you will be a deep Sahaja Yogi.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.779
Best is this. Because intellect is nothing – so-called intellect.

01:02:39.899 --> 01:02:45.540
Only God has intelligence, nobody has! To be very frank.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.700
It’s a big joke, isn’t it?

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:56.420
Every one thinks they are intelligent but they are not, they are stupid.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.899
You see, all stupidity is considered as intelligence these days.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.779
For example, cunningness – it never pays you dividends.

01:03:03.899 --> 01:03:08.100
What is intellect? Is the only understanding of intellect

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:13.580
as Adi Shankaracharya had put it –

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.500
“Na yoge, na sankhya,”

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.779
All these things are good for nothing.

01:03:17.899 --> 01:03:22.180
Only service to your Mother is the best way.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:26.700
Ask your intellect, “Is it serving my Mother?”

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:31.660
Intellect will tell you, the so-called intellect of human beings,

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:36.740
to cheat yourself. It cheats you. It gives you escapes. It cheats you.

01:03:36.899 --> 01:03:39.340
All the time the intellect is working by saying,

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.779
“This may be good, that may be good” you see,

01:03:42.899 --> 01:03:45.820
but the real good, it never sees.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.260
It’s a trick of the ego, trick of the ego.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.779
Is the choices. Ego likes choices, you see.

01:03:52.899 --> 01:03:56.779
So, “This is good, this is bad, this I don’t like this, this.”

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:59.660
All ‘I’ business should be given up and say that,

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.899
“Not this, not this, not this.”

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.540
“We” should come in, “we”, not “I”.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:13.340
Now you are not anymore ‘I’s, you are ‘we’ now.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:18.700
That’s how the intellect will go away.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.500
Because this intellect has gathered all kind of nonsense

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.820
and it doesn’t exist! That’s the biggest maya!

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.700
It doesn’t exist! There is no intelligence at all!

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.500
What is the intelligence, is just to understand

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:36.460
that there is nothing like this intellect – you are nothing.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.580
You see, to explain His intellect would be something

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.060
like explaining human civilisation to an ant!

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:47.300
Even that is easier! It’s like that – His intellect.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:59.899
And He’s innocent. So simple. I mean, anybody is amazed how can that be.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:07.100
So the most intelligent person is the one who knows

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:12.660
that our intellect is just a ego-trip.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.780
This is the sign of pure intelligence,

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:26.779
is the sign of pure understanding

01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:32.860
that the heart is the ruler, there resides the Spirit

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:37.220
which is the most intelligent thing within us.

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:42.420
And the inspiration of the Spirit is the manifestation

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:45.899
of the pure intellect of God.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:52.899
And what I told you today is the intellect of the heart.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.580
But of the brain – zero!

01:06:01.899 --> 01:06:04.420
But then, what’s the use of the brain?

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.300
Why have brain? Why not only have heart? It would be alright.

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:11.860
But the brain is the one which acts.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:16.260
Heart gives the inspiration but the brain acts on it,

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.220
it’s communicating.

01:06:19.899 --> 01:06:23.460
But the inspiration, the source, is the heart, is the Spirit.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.899
Again connect yourself to the Spirit.

01:06:30.796 --> 01:06:38.717
Intelligently, how will you explain Kundalini awakening?

01:06:38.899 --> 01:06:42.260
Leave alone Kundalini, how can you explain sprouting of the seed

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.980
intelligently, through your intellect?

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:55.899
Explain, means, explain why, how.

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.779
Sprouting of the seed, a simple thing

01:06:58.899 --> 01:07:01.899
which you see thousand and one times.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:10.180
How will you explain? Intellect is that says, “I cannot explain.”

01:07:11.899 --> 01:07:16.899
A very limited thing. It’s ego, nothing but ego.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:25.740
And once you get rid of it then the pure intellect starts coming in.

01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:29.779
You see, with [Mr.] Yoga Singh, you will be amazed, you see, who is,

01:07:29.899 --> 01:07:33.580
I mean he came to us as a bhoot absolutely. He’s so much changed.

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.779
Now he speaks, I tell you, he speaks like a saint.

01:07:36.899 --> 01:07:38.940
I was amazed!

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.060
He speaks so well sometimes that I want to quote him sometimes

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:46.420
– the way he speaks about certain things.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:50.540
I am amazed how he has started talking like that.

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.779
So whatever you have to say relate it to the Spirit

01:07:57.899 --> 01:07:59.860
you will talk like saints.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.540
Relate it to Spirit, not to anything else,

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.060
relate it to Spirit and you will be amazed.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:18.779
He told me that, “There are many people in this world who are absurd.”

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:20.580
I said, “How do you know?”

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.899
He says “Because they don’t want to know anything about you.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:31.940
I don’t know why are they here and why have you created them!”

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:38.540
You see, he was a person with so many bhoots on his head.

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.779
He’s such a beautiful man, I tell you.

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:48.220
He says this, “This is your servant is alright,

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.779
but he has to learn certain things if he has to live well.

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:57.700
He doesn’t have neatness. Because his mind is not neat.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:03.899
He has to be a cleaner person. But his mind is not clean.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:08.899
His heart is alright. But the mind should be clean.”

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:11.899
I was amazed at him.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:17.580
He’s not an educated man or anything, just an ordinary person.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:20.060
But they start talking like prophets.

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.380
I think you’d better read some of the prophets

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.300
you will also start talking like them.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:29.940
You read Kabir, Khalil Gibran, all these people.

01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:33.700
What is Blake? He was a prophet too.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:38.220
You can talk like him. Why not?

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:43.340
He talked through his Spirit isn’t it? Pure intelligence.

01:09:44.899 --> 01:09:48.899
Then you’ll become Shri Rama if you can do that.

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:54.779
So today’s a great day. I’m happy you all could come.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:58.660
And it has worked out so well that this is,

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:03.460
I was going to come here and talk about Shri Rama

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:08.899
and wish you all that you follow Him up.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.779
Respect yourself!

01:10:10.899 --> 01:10:15.660
And it’s your responsibility to be good, to be like that,

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.899
to work it out that way.

01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:21.940
May God bless you.

01:10:39.899 --> 01:10:44.740
Alright.  You wanted to do a small, little puja? You can wash my feet.

01:10:44.899 --> 01:10:49.500
And have you got Shri Rama’s anything

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:59.540
