00:47:53.484 --> 00:47:56.684
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:48:03.744 --> 00:48:09.124
At the very outset I have to say that truth is what it is

00:48:10.464 --> 00:48:15.344
You cannot change it, you cannot transform it

00:48:16.224 --> 00:48:22.604
and unfortunately at this human awareness, you cannot know what is the truth.

00:48:24.104 --> 00:48:27.424
You may describe, you may talk about it

00:48:28.324 --> 00:48:34.124
but to know the truth, something more has to happen to you.

00:48:38.824 --> 00:48:45.084
Now whatever I'm going to tell you today, you need not accept it blind-folded.

00:48:45.284 --> 00:48:49.404
We have had lots of problems with the blind faith

00:48:49.964 --> 00:48:53.804
but if it is proved, then

00:48:55.864 --> 00:49:02.144
as honest people you have to accept it. So please keep your mind open

00:49:03.644 --> 00:49:08.924
like a scientist because

00:49:09.524 --> 00:49:14.324
it's very important to know the Absolute Truth in these modern times.

00:49:15.864 --> 00:49:20.484
That's the solution for all our problems

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:26.724
physical, mental, emotional and also spiritual.

00:49:29.384 --> 00:49:33.884
Seekers of Truth are people who have problems of spirituality

00:49:34.964 --> 00:49:38.884
and they don't know what to seek, where to go, how to find it.

00:49:39.764 --> 00:49:45.124
They are mislaid by many people because the market is full of such people

00:49:48.304 --> 00:49:51.184
so I would like to tell you what is the truth.

00:49:52.204 --> 00:49:59.124
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions

00:50:00.524 --> 00:50:07.364
this ego and these conditionings but you are much beyond that, is the spirit.

00:50:08.384 --> 00:50:14.884
So the truth is that you have to become the spirit and the second truth is

00:50:16.704 --> 00:50:23.884
something we are not aware of at all. We see all these beautiful flowers around us

00:50:24.864 --> 00:50:31.604
and we take them for granted. Actually, it's a miracle to have these different flowers

00:50:31.924 --> 00:50:39.984
of different shapes and different fragrance uh.. to come out of the same Mother Earth.

00:50:41.124 --> 00:50:45.284
We don't know who works it out, who works out the seasons

00:50:45.684 --> 00:50:52.424
or if you ask a doctor, "Who runs your heart?" he'll tell, it's an Autonomous Nervous System

00:50:52.684 --> 00:50:56.644
but if you ask him, "Who is this auto?" he won't be able to tell you.

00:51:00.764 --> 00:51:04.384
Who is doing this work, I say, is

00:51:05.704 --> 00:51:13.064
the All-Pervading Divine power of love. We have never known the power of love -

00:51:13.684 --> 00:51:20.504
we have only worked with the power of hatred but this is The One that exists all over

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:24.584
and works in every human-being in the same manner.

00:51:28.124 --> 00:51:32.524
As you must have been told about the subtle system that is within us -

00:51:33.064 --> 00:51:38.024
I mean, it's not easy for people to believe that there is another subtle system within us

00:51:38.984 --> 00:51:44.964
but we have to understand that the Creator who has created us

00:51:45.464 --> 00:51:52.264
is the greatest organizer and He must organize something within us to achieve

00:51:53.584 --> 00:51:59.304
our last breakthrough in our evolution.

00:51:59.944 --> 00:52:04.964
We have not reached to that point where we can say we know the Absolute Truth

00:52:05.524 --> 00:52:12.564
that's why there are so many problems, so many philosophies, so many ideologies and people just fighting among themselves

00:52:12.864 --> 00:52:15.844
even in the name of God.

00:52:18.504 --> 00:52:22.664
The people who started all these great religions

00:52:24.544 --> 00:52:32.584
like, we can say Moses, Christ, Mohammad Sahab, Rama, Krishna, all of them

00:52:33.764 --> 00:52:40.624
knew the Truth and they established their religion

00:52:41.284 --> 00:52:47.584
in a way that shows it is more the evolutionary process they were talking about.

00:52:48.444 --> 00:52:55.544
They all said that, "The time has to come when you'll get your resurrection." Mohammad Sahab has called is the 'Kiyama',

00:52:55.864 --> 00:52:58.984
in the Bible it's called as the Last 'Judgment'.

00:53:02.704 --> 00:53:08.004
They were very great people, I must say, and very pure, extremely pure

00:53:08.564 --> 00:53:12.484
and they never realized what sort of people they're facing,

00:53:13.764 --> 00:53:20.124
how people were ignorant about the Divine Power, about the Divinity within themselves.

00:53:20.884 --> 00:53:28.024
So they propounded many things which were really an impossible task for human-beings to do.

00:53:29.224 --> 00:53:35.184
To call yourself a Christian is easy but to follow Christianity is very difficult.

00:53:36.704 --> 00:53:42.684
Christ has said that, "If one eye commits the sin, you take it out,

00:53:43.464 --> 00:53:47.504
if one hand does something wrong, you take it out."

00:53:48.444 --> 00:53:55.344
I haven't seen anybody without one eye or without one hand in the whole Christian Kingdoms I have moved about.

00:53:56.124 --> 00:54:02.744
So that means that it's not so easy to follow Christ, who was such a pure soul,

00:54:03.364 --> 00:54:08.484
who thought all the human-beings were angels or some sort of

00:54:08.744 --> 00:54:14.044
Divine people that they will follow whatever He has said it. Then came Mohammad Sahab and He

00:54:14.344 --> 00:54:19.464
thought that why only the men are being told, why not the women?

00:54:21.504 --> 00:54:26.804
So His sense of morality was more sharp, specially for women.

00:54:27.084 --> 00:54:35.244
He said that, any woman who has bad feelings uh.. towards, I mean, unholy feelings towards another man

00:54:36.024 --> 00:54:43.824
should be buried half-way into the Mother Earth and should be killed with stones

00:54:45.244 --> 00:54:51.884
because, perhaps, Mohammad Sahab must have said what Christ has said that you should do it and nobody is going to do it,

00:54:52.104 --> 00:54:55.964
so people incharge of religion should do it - imagine!

00:54:57.344 --> 00:55:03.104
If this kind of a law was applied in America, how many women could survive, I don't know.

00:55:08.124 --> 00:55:12.924
So, I don't blame them because their idea about human-beings was very different

00:55:13.524 --> 00:55:21.264
and they couldn't understand the inability of a human-being to take to something that is higher.

00:55:21.904 --> 00:55:26.664
Normally, the tendency is to take to something uh.. destructive,

00:55:27.284 --> 00:55:31.804
to take to something that takes you away from reality

00:55:32.424 --> 00:55:39.604
and this, you cannot stop, you cannot tell them don't do it. Many people promise in the morning, "All right, I'll not do it,"

00:55:40.104 --> 00:55:46.124
but they cannot keep to it because they haven't got the light of the Spirit in their life.

00:55:47.044 --> 00:55:53.584
So we have to have the light of the Spirit in our heart. People talk of peace.

00:55:55.704 --> 00:56:02.764
There are organizations after organization for peace. I met many people who have got awards for peace

00:56:03.024 --> 00:56:08.924
but they are very disturbed people, very angry people, very hot-tempered people -

00:56:09.864 --> 00:56:14.024
I could not imagine how they got this award for peace because there's no peace within.

00:56:15.484 --> 00:56:23.284
There is a way to achieve that peace within yourself. Unless and until we become peaceful within ourselves

00:56:23.724 --> 00:56:30.764
where there is no problem between our heart, our brain and our attention,

00:56:31.764 --> 00:56:37.024
then only we could be peaceful. This can be very easily achieved

00:56:38.124 --> 00:56:43.544
through this happening where this power of Kundalini has to rise.

00:56:45.004 --> 00:56:50.224
It's like a primule in a seed. It's a living process.

00:56:50.504 --> 00:56:57.624
As you can put a seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself, spontaneously - sahaja.

00:56:58.884 --> 00:57:06.384
'Saha' means born, 'ja', 'Saha' means with and 'ja' is born - is born with you, this power

00:57:07.044 --> 00:57:10.944
to attain this higher level of awareness

00:57:11.344 --> 00:57:17.004
which in Sanskrit we call it as 'Turiya' or you can say the fourth dimension of awareness.

00:57:17.544 --> 00:57:25.184
It's not at all difficult, you're all capable of getting that - only thing you have to have earnest desire to get it.

00:57:25.744 --> 00:57:32.304
Ofcourse you can't give realization or awakening to people who are

00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:40.944
stupid, idiotic or who are arrogant. You have to have earnest desire to achieve that state

00:57:42.104 --> 00:57:48.104
because this power, which we call as Kundalini, is nothing but pure desire

00:57:49.624 --> 00:57:54.064
because other desires are not pure.

00:57:54.904 --> 00:58:01.984
Today we want to have a car, then we want to have a house, then we want to have a helicopter, I don't know

00:58:02.304 --> 00:58:08.844
goes on and on and on. We're never satisfied with what we have . That shows the desires we had

00:58:09.064 --> 00:58:15.344
were not pure. The pure desire is to be one with this Divine power.

00:58:16.484 --> 00:58:23.724
But if this desire, whether you are aware or not aware, is not fulfilled

00:58:24.864 --> 00:58:32.664
then you become seekers of truth and this is the state, I find, is now

00:58:33.084 --> 00:58:37.884
in this horrible modern times, is so much evident.

00:58:38.564 --> 00:58:43.804
In every country I have visited I was surprised, whether it was Islamic or Russian,

00:58:44.564 --> 00:58:52.264
England, Australia, anywhere, I was surprised that people are earnestly seeking the Truth.

00:58:53.344 --> 00:59:00.784
They might make mistakes, as I said, they might go to wrong paths but definitely there are seekers

00:59:01.064 --> 00:59:07.004
and restlessly they're seeking the Ultimate, which is the Absolute Truth.

00:59:09.464 --> 00:59:12.824
Spirit is the source of Absolute Truth.

00:59:15.184 --> 00:59:22.044
You cannot know anything without

00:59:22.304 --> 00:59:28.924
becoming Self-realized as far as it's own

00:59:30.204 --> 00:59:38.164
understanding is, like supposing somebody says that democracy is right, somebody says that uh...

00:59:38.844 --> 00:59:46.964
another style of uh.. communism is good or socialism is good on politics or economics, anywhere

00:59:47.504 --> 00:59:52.564
they never agree, even the religions don't want to agree - they want to be exclusive -

00:59:54.184 --> 01:00:00.404
but if you see the thing what Mohammad sahab has written, He never was exclusive.

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:06.324
He talked about Moses, He talked about Christ, He

01:00:07.144 --> 01:00:13.664
talked about Christ's Mother with great reverence, so He was not exclusive.

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:20.044
I don't know how people have found exclusive religions. Must be some sort of a

01:00:21.844 --> 01:00:27.944
selfish interest that people started saying this religion is good, that religion is good, that religion is good.

01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:33.584
And when we don't know the Absolute Truth, we start believing in all this kind of things.

01:00:34.484 --> 01:00:40.044
To believe into anything blindly, is not going to help us.

01:00:40.684 --> 01:00:47.424
We have to have the insight, insight to see what is really the Truth.

01:00:48.464 --> 01:00:54.044
So when this happening takes place, what happens is that you feel a cool breeze

01:00:54.304 --> 01:01:00.224
of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head. You'll be amazed to know that

01:01:01.604 --> 01:01:07.024
the Kundalini is your own mother, individual mother.

01:01:07.924 --> 01:01:14.104
and She's the reflection of the Holy Ghost within you. She knows everything about you -

01:01:15.944 --> 01:01:22.864
your past, your aspirations, everything She knows and She is your individual mother very anxious

01:01:23.284 --> 01:01:29.944
to give you your second birth. She has been waiting and waiting and waiting and when

01:01:30.664 --> 01:01:36.844
the chance comes, She really shoots up like a jet, I must say, in this jet age.

01:01:37.284 --> 01:01:42.504
Is very surprising, how in these modern times it is working so fast.

01:01:42.704 --> 01:01:50.224
Maybe the pure desire of people is very strong and it has been predicted that at this time all these things will happen.

01:01:51.064 --> 01:01:58.424
I must say, you're all very lucky people to be born at this time and that you are seekers

01:01:59.144 --> 01:02:06.484
of ancient ages and then you should really get it. And you get it also,

01:02:07.604 --> 01:02:15.424
you must have faith in yourself. We have no faith in ourselves, not in our identity.

01:02:15.784 --> 01:02:22.744
We take to all kinds of nonsensical things because we don't know what we are. If we know how glorious we are,

01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:29.684
how great we are, what is our potential, what we can do, how many powers we have

01:02:30.104 --> 01:02:36.464
then we would not indulge into all these things. We'll not go to that extent

01:02:37.084 --> 01:02:44.484
that one becomes really mad and crazy. This identification can be easily found out

01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:49.704
once you know yourself. We know the whole world but we don't know about ourselves.

01:02:50.124 --> 01:02:55.984
First of all, you will know about your own centers that are. These centers represent

01:02:56.344 --> 01:03:02.864
all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being and on your finger-tips you know,

01:03:03.484 --> 01:03:09.524
very clearly, what centers are catching. Now supposing, you know how to cure them

01:03:10.984 --> 01:03:18.064
and if you know how to cure for others also, so you can cure yourself and cure others

01:03:18.364 --> 01:03:26.084
because you develop a new dimension in your awareness which we call as Collective Consciousness

01:03:26.864 --> 01:03:34.244
where you can feel others, very clearly, on your finger-tips. This is your potential, this you have within yourself.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:41.064
It just starts working and you're amazed how you can feel the centers that are within yourself

01:03:41.324 --> 01:03:49.224
and the centers that are with other people. You can feel for the people who are dead, who are living, who are far away

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:56.044
when you grow into your awareness which is, I said, the fourth dimension, then it starts working

01:03:56.464 --> 01:04:03.024
and you're amazed the way you can cure yourself and you can cure others.

01:04:03.544 --> 01:04:09.204
There are three doctors, who have got MD, in Delhi, for curing incurable diseases

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:15.144
and now we're trying to put down how many cancer patients have been cured in sahaja yoga.

01:04:16.884 --> 01:04:23.504
Christ cured so many people. How did He cure, nobody bothers to know and to find out what did He do?

01:04:23.844 --> 01:04:29.584
When He cured people, He must be having some powers and what were His powers by which He cured?

01:04:30.904 --> 01:04:36.364
There are so many diseases we have which we call incurable, can be easily cured with sahaja yoga.

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:42.664
First of all, what we need are people who are evolved

01:04:43.764 --> 01:04:49.924
and who are matured in sahaja yoga. Once you're matured, you become an expert

01:04:50.724 --> 01:04:56.364
and also very humble, very compassionate, very loving.

01:04:56.764 --> 01:05:01.164
All your temper and all your anger and hatred falls out.

01:05:01.484 --> 01:05:09.664
It's a fact, I'm not telling you some stories. We have many here, at least, I think, 30% people who're sitting here, have got it.

01:05:10.284 --> 01:05:15.624
But they dress-up like you, they live like you but they're very peaceful and

01:05:16.304 --> 01:05:20.704
they have given up all that was destructive in them, all that was

01:05:21.024 --> 01:05:28.644
spoiling their lives - their married lives are very good, they have beautiful children. So, there's a vision.

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:36.604
One can see clearly that this whole world will one day become a beautiful place for all of us to live together happily

01:05:36.944 --> 01:05:44.564
and without any uh.. grievances about others. All these

01:05:45.804 --> 01:05:51.724
uh.. different ideas of racialism or caste-system and all those,

01:05:51.984 --> 01:05:55.604
will just drop out because you become a universal being.

01:05:58.884 --> 01:06:04.964
When you go to, say America - you are a sahaja yogi - all the sahaja yogies will come to see you.

01:06:05.824 --> 01:06:09.844
One person falls sick, say in Australia,

01:06:10.064 --> 01:06:14.544
all the sahaja yogies from all the world will make inquiries and find out how is he?

01:06:15.344 --> 01:06:23.144
You have so many who are talking about brotherhood, friendliness but cannot be because there is this

01:06:23.544 --> 01:06:31.404
uh.. we can say, a partition within us between the Divine and ourselves

01:06:32.224 --> 01:06:40.004
but once you know the Divine, you're amazed to see that the Divinity just gives you that confidence

01:06:40.244 --> 01:06:46.884
and that understanding on your Central Nervous System. It is not just talking and lecturing.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:54.444
In Sanskrit the word is 'bodh' from the word 'Buddha', means to know on your Central Nervous System.

01:06:55.284 --> 01:07:02.384
Even 'Vedas' means 'Vid'. Vid also
Sanskrit means to know on your Central Nervous System.

01:07:02.604 --> 01:07:06.624
The truth is to be known on your Central Nervous System.

01:07:07.264 --> 01:07:15.044
You don't have to do absurd things for that at all. For example, I was there this year in Chicago and it was very, very cold

01:07:15.704 --> 01:07:21.804
and a gentleman came with a dhoti and all his head was shaved.

01:07:22.704 --> 01:07:26.244
I asked him, "In this cold why are you shivering in a dhoti?"

01:07:26.624 --> 01:07:34.644
So he told Me, "My guru has said that if you wear a dhoti, you'll get your Nirvana, you'll get your, your salvation."

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:42.724
"And what about this head of yours?" He said, "Yes. That also he has said that you must shave your head and must have a pigtail

01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:47.724
so you'll get your Nirvana." I said, "How could you believe such a nonsensical thing?"

01:07:48.204 --> 01:07:56.064
In India, 80% people wear dhoties, they must already be there and what, what about this shaven head.

01:07:57.404 --> 01:08:02.844
Kabira has said, "If by shaving head, if you can go to Heaven,

01:08:03.404 --> 01:08:10.624
what about the lamb which is shaved every uh.. year twice? That would be there already to welcome you."

01:08:11.904 --> 01:08:19.864
So all these nonsensical things people try to do meditation and they say that you can rise above

01:08:20.524 --> 01:08:27.444
the Mother Earth. What is the need, I don't understand? As it is we have problem of jams and why do you want to

01:08:27.664 --> 01:08:34.144
go on three feet troubling everybody. All these funny ideas

01:08:34.684 --> 01:08:41.404
I don't know how people accept and pay thousands and thousands of dollars on that.

01:08:42.624 --> 01:08:48.624
Actually you must understand that you cannot pay for Divine love, you cannot pay

01:08:50.464 --> 01:08:56.344
because God doesn't understand money, He doesn't understand bank - that's your headache not His.

01:08:57.064 --> 01:09:04.084
So once you realize that you cannot pay, most of these people will disappear from this earth

01:09:04.424 --> 01:09:11.104
but it's very difficult for human-beings to say that you cannot pay because they want to purchase everything.

01:09:11.464 --> 01:09:16.504
Even Me, they would say, "Mother, why shouldn't You take some money?" I said, "But for what, how much are you going to pay?"

01:09:16.984 --> 01:09:22.344
This is something invaluable - you cannot value it, how much are you going to pay?

01:09:23.384 --> 01:09:30.424
Then, you don't have to do any exercise for it like standing on your head or doing all kinds of these

01:09:31.924 --> 01:09:37.424
asanas and this - it's alright for your health but it's not for achieving

01:09:38.664 --> 01:09:42.784
your ascent. It's not for that. Some people

01:09:43.084 --> 01:09:48.084
fast and starve and torture the body, which is absolutely wrong.

01:09:49.924 --> 01:09:57.764
You see, God Almighty is your Father, Father of all the fathers, all the compassion is with Him.

01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:03.244
Which father would like his son to torture because he wants to meet the father?

01:10:03.704 --> 01:10:08.964
So He's the Father of fathers. How will He expect you to torture your body like this?

01:10:09.324 --> 01:10:15.764
But this idea from where it has come, I don't know, that you must torture your life just to achieve your ascent.

01:10:18.004 --> 01:10:24.724
It's very simple, you have to be normal people and as normal people, you get your Self-realization.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:31.124
Self-realization, you can say, goes into two unnh..stages.

01:10:31.684 --> 01:10:36.704
First you achieve a state when you are thoughtlessly aware.

01:10:38.244 --> 01:10:41.764
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of thoughts

01:10:41.964 --> 01:10:49.504
which come from the future or from the past. We cannot be in the present - it's impossible.

01:10:50.244 --> 01:10:54.324
But when this Kundalini rises, She elongates those thoughts

01:10:54.704 --> 01:10:59.284
and creates a space in between, which in Sanskrit called as 'Vilamba' is the pause

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:07.544
and there it is you are thoughtlessly aware and that is the point where you grow spiritually,

01:11:08.384 --> 01:11:12.644
that is the point where you become a witness of the whole play

01:11:12.844 --> 01:11:17.244
and also, that is the point where you become absolutely peaceful.

01:11:17.924 --> 01:11:25.004
You watch everything happening, you see everything going on but you are just watching it.

01:11:25.564 --> 01:11:32.164
Like when you are in the water, the water creates waves and you're afraid of the waves

01:11:33.004 --> 01:11:38.204
but supposing you get on to a boat, you can see the same waves and enjoy

01:11:38.444 --> 01:11:45.624
but supposing you learn how to swim, you can jump down and save many people. In the same stages you have to pass through.

01:11:46.284 --> 01:11:52.824
So the first one is where you become thoughtlessly aware and the second stage is

01:11:53.064 --> 01:11:59.184
where you're doubtlessly aware - you have no doubts about yourself, about Divinity, about anything.

01:11:59.844 --> 01:12:04.464
But it happens to some people, both things together, somehow and

01:12:04.704 --> 01:12:08.544
they achieve a state of complete peace within.

01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:14.384
They also emit peace, they also emit Divine vibrations

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:18.444
by which many problems can be solved, many

01:12:20.564 --> 01:12:25.024
people who need peace, can achieve it.

01:12:26.064 --> 01:12:32.544
The another quality of Spirit is that when it is in attention, it enlightens your attention.

01:12:33.124 --> 01:12:39.844
By that enlightenment you can see things which normal you don't see, you feel which you never felt.

01:12:40.604 --> 01:12:45.604
It's very surprising that this attention is so

01:12:46.584 --> 01:12:54.644
active, so meticulously working. If you pay attention to something, it works out.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:13:02.204
It works, this attention works and this is a kind of an attention you have which is potential

01:13:02.484 --> 01:13:08.744
but once it becomes enlightened, it becomes such a dynamic force within yourself and

01:13:09.504 --> 01:13:16.764
you pay attention to yourself and attention to others and amazingly you help people by your attention.

01:13:17.904 --> 01:13:25.004
The another greatest quality of Spirit is that it is the source of joy.

01:13:26.744 --> 01:13:33.484
Not that only it is the source of Absolute Truth but it's a source of joy.

01:13:35.404 --> 01:13:43.144
You work very hard, you do everything but you are a witness of the whole work. You don't think you're doing anything but you're just enjoying everything.

01:13:43.884 --> 01:13:51.904
You're enjoying your value system, you're enjoying your morality, you're uh.. enjoying your virtues.

01:13:53.004 --> 01:14:00.964
This joy is the source of doing everything effortlessly -

01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:08.404
sahaja. It all works out, it works out so beautifully that amazingly

01:14:09.424 --> 01:14:12.944
we find in a new world which we call the Kingdom of God.

01:14:14.224 --> 01:14:20.224
When I went to America, they had a problem of this school going on, so -

01:14:20.864 --> 01:14:26.944
no I'm sorry, to Russia - and the Russians were least disturbed, who were sahaja yogies.

01:14:27.344 --> 01:14:31.844
I said, "Aren't you worried about this school which's going on?" He said, "Why should we, Mother?

01:14:32.124 --> 01:14:36.244
We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry. We are not in the kingdom of Russia. "

01:14:36.684 --> 01:14:43.844
Can you imagine, such a confidence! And we have thousands and thousands of Russians who have taken to sahaja yoga

01:14:44.084 --> 01:14:51.384
because they're not conditioned. They're very clean people and they have understood what is Truth is.

01:14:51.804 --> 01:14:57.724
In the same way it's working out everywhere, no doubt but in the West I find people are very

01:14:57.984 --> 01:15:03.464
conditioned about things and these conditionings sometimes stops them from achieving

01:15:03.824 --> 01:15:10.244
Self- realization. Slowly, slowly they also start taking to it.

01:15:10.644 --> 01:15:17.024
First time we had two people from Australia who came to see Me in Bombay -

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:23.864
they got their realization, only two persons and today we have so many in Australia

01:15:24.724 --> 01:15:31.304
because definitely they're very nice people, they want to be good, they want to achieve

01:15:31.684 --> 01:15:36.604
something higher, they are all sincere about it and

01:15:37.624 --> 01:15:41.744
we have to now think about our younger people

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:46.944
who are supposed to be mislaid by many wrong things.

01:15:47.444 --> 01:15:53.804
These also have come to sahaja yoga and have become quite alright, very normal, very beautiful people.

01:15:54.504 --> 01:15:58.464
We have no problems of younger people, even of smaller children.

01:16:00.104 --> 01:16:08.084
It's the times, I call it the blossom time, which is here and we should take full advantage of that.

01:16:09.924 --> 01:16:17.424
I'm sure all of you are going to get your realization. Only one thing you have to remember that you must have faith in yourself.

01:16:17.764 --> 01:16:20.864
Do not doubt yourself for anything whatsoever.

01:16:21.304 --> 01:16:26.764
As long as you don't doubt yourself, you'll get your Self-realization without any difficulty.

01:16:28.824 --> 01:16:35.304
May God bless you! Can we have some lights there also?

01:16:35.784 --> 01:16:44.124
[ALL CLAP]

01:16:44.684 --> 01:16:48.244
Can we have some lights at the back, I can't see them.

01:17:12.564 --> 01:17:20.564
Can't have lights underneath that? Can't have? You can have lights there - please, alright, it's good.

01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:37.244
Those who are standing, can you sit down or you can come here in this room to sit -
it's better to sit down.

01:17:47.804 --> 01:17:52.444
It will hardly take ten minutes and

01:17:53.424 --> 01:17:57.724
only thing is, I would request you, not to disturb others

01:17:58.104 --> 01:18:02.184
by walking out or getting up at that time - hardly ten minutes.

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:29.084
Of course you have questions, so you may write to Me and I will definitely try to answer them.

01:18:30.684 --> 01:18:37.304
I have been doing this work for the last 25 years now and I'm quite an expert in answering all kinds of

01:18:37.524 --> 01:18:42.284
questions whether they are funny, stupid or anyway genuine.

01:18:43.204 --> 01:18:51.504
Ah..So, but it's an mental acrobat. There's nothing so great. It's only up to the mind - you have to go beyond the mind, so

01:18:51.844 --> 01:18:57.404
it's better that we should forget about those questions just now, get your realization

01:18:58.344 --> 01:19:01.464
and then I'll see how many have questions.

01:19:05.644 --> 01:19:08.924
Now

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:36.024
of course there are some conditions, which are very simple conditions, which, I hope, you can follow.

01:19:40.224 --> 01:19:43.224
One of them,

01:19:52.424 --> 01:19:59.964
one of them is that you have to know at this moment

01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:07.584
you are not guilty of anything. If you were, you would have been in jail.

01:20:08.764 --> 01:20:14.184
But when you are sitting here, please forgive yourself - very important.

01:20:15.484 --> 01:20:22.984
If you don't forgive yourself and you call yourself always guilty of something - I mean,

01:20:23.244 --> 01:20:29.664
the norms of life in the West is so funny that even if you put your spoon like this, then you feel guilty.

01:20:30.844 --> 01:20:33.824
It's nothing important.

01:20:36.584 --> 01:20:43.584
But if you feel guilty, then you catch on this center on the left-hand side, which we call as Left Vishudhdhi

01:20:44.964 --> 01:20:48.584
and it's very dangerous because it causes

01:20:51.804 --> 01:20:57.764
a very big damage. You might get Angina,

01:20:59.364 --> 01:21:04.504
you might get spondylitis or you might get lethargic organs.

01:21:05.404 --> 01:21:12.664
So, what is the use of feeling guilty - it's not your job to feel guilty and carrying these

01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:19.724
dangers with you. So, in all compassion and love of God, please forgive yourself

01:21:20.164 --> 01:21:25.324
and know that you're not guilty at all. It's a fashion also to be guilty for anything.

01:21:26.324 --> 01:21:32.724
Like, I met one lady, she was guilty because in Afghanistan people were starving. I said, "Why're you feeling guilty?

01:21:33.984 --> 01:21:39.584
If they're starving, send some money. What's the use of sitting down and feeling guilty?" It's a kind of a, you see,

01:21:39.844 --> 01:21:45.384
a melodramatic uh.. attitude, I think, that people think, "Oh, I'm guilty, how can I?"

01:21:45.664 --> 01:21:52.664
And to Me, some people told Me that, "You look so joyous, that's not good," in France once, first when I went there.

01:21:53.004 --> 01:21:58.204
"You shouldn't look so joyous." I said, "But I am, what can I do?" They said, "No,

01:21:59.104 --> 01:22:06.624
here people are very miserable and you must say you're miserable." So, I said, "Why are they miserable here?"

01:22:07.544 --> 01:22:12.324
So, I started My lecture with Les Miserable

01:22:13.724 --> 01:22:19.124
and I said if every tenth lamp-post has got a pub and

01:22:20.844 --> 01:22:25.124
about twelfth lamp-post there's a prostitute standing, what else will it be?

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:34.864
You're inviting your own miseries and sitting outside on the street they were discussing when the world is going to end.

01:22:35.824 --> 01:22:39.964
That's the best - because now they're fed-up with themselves so they wanted to end the world also.

01:22:41.164 --> 01:22:47.864
So all this is more sort of a, mental attitude to feel guilty, "I should not have done that, I should not have done that."

01:22:48.144 --> 01:22:52.164
So at this moment, I would request, don't feel guilty

01:22:55.024 --> 01:22:58.964
because if this center is in jeopardy,

01:22:59.824 --> 01:23:03.644
this Kundalini won't rise, it cannot penetrate.

01:23:04.444 --> 01:23:08.364
So, you'll also miss such a nice opportunity.

01:23:09.344 --> 01:23:16.604
Then there is another problem is with the center on the optic chiasma

01:23:16.964 --> 01:23:19.924
which we call as Agnya chakra.

01:23:20.764 --> 01:23:27.284
If you do not forgive people, it becomes like this. It's a very constricted center

01:23:28.644 --> 01:23:35.484
so you have to forgive others also. If you forgive others, then this center opens out like this

01:23:36.284 --> 01:23:39.304
otherwise it's impossible.

01:23:40.504 --> 01:23:46.664
You cannot crossover this center, it's one of the most difficult ones, so please,

01:23:47.264 --> 01:23:53.484
just at this moment, forgive everyone in general. Don't even think about people

01:23:53.764 --> 01:23:59.704
whom you have to forgive because it's a headache even to think of them. So just in general you forgive everyone,

01:23:59.964 --> 01:24:05.304
just forgive everyone. You'll feel very happy and much lighter just now.

01:24:07.324 --> 01:24:13.004
These are the two conditions we have, the third one is easier, is to take out your shoes.

01:24:14.524 --> 01:24:21.524
When I said this in England, half of them walked out on the first day - they couldn't take out their shoes, so much attached to them.

01:24:33.144 --> 01:24:40.604
Because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. it helps us a lot to achieve

01:24:41.664 --> 01:24:49.044
the, achieve our ascent. She sucks our problems.

01:24:49.964 --> 01:24:57.924
You don't know what this Mother Earth is. It's a very great blessing, specially in Australia, is a very great land.

01:25:04.484 --> 01:25:12.064
Now, in the beginning we'll tell you how we'll be nourishing our centers

01:25:13.564 --> 01:25:19.864
which is very simple. This is only once you have to do tonight - you don't have to do it again, it's alright, very, very simple.

01:25:21.744 --> 01:25:28.144
Now after taking out your shoes, you please put both your feet apart from each other - that's all.

01:25:29.804 --> 01:25:37.704
Because as there are two powers within us, left and right, which are very different, so better keep them away from each other.

01:25:42.264 --> 01:25:50.244
The left power, which we call as the Left Sympathetic Nervous System, which is nourished by Ida Nadi

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:57.724
is for our desire, works out our desires which is, uh..

01:25:57.924 --> 01:26:02.304
I should say, not a concrete thing, just you desire through this Nadi.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:10.324
So, you have to put your left hand, like this, on your lap - very comfortably you should sit down -

01:26:10.944 --> 01:26:16.704
uh.. indicating that you're desirous of getting your Self-realization, that's all.

01:26:17.544 --> 01:26:25.024
Just put your left hand towards Me like this all the time. With the right hand is for your action.

01:26:27.004 --> 01:26:34.064
The right Nadi, which is Pingala Nadi, works out for your action. So you have to use your right hand

01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:43.244
on different centers on the left-hand side - we work only on the left-hand side. So put your right-hand on your heart, please.

01:26:45.764 --> 01:26:52.564
In the heart resides the Spirit. I've already told you about the Spirit.

01:26:57.164 --> 01:27:01.244
If you become the Spirit, you have the light of the Spirit

01:27:01.504 --> 01:27:06.264
and you become your own guide, you become your own master, you become your own guru.

01:27:07.304 --> 01:27:12.564
So we take our right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:27:12.964 --> 01:27:16.984
which is the center of your mastery.

01:27:24.184 --> 01:27:28.484
Then we take our hand in the lower portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:27:30.164 --> 01:27:36.864
Surprisingly, this is the center of pure knowledge of the Divine.

01:27:41.124 --> 01:27:44.444
Then we take our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen,

01:27:49.304 --> 01:27:52.224
then on our heart again.

01:27:54.084 --> 01:28:02.044
Now, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder - I've already told you about this chakra - and turn your head to your right.

01:28:04.324 --> 01:28:10.144
I think, is really very caught up here -

01:28:10.764 --> 01:28:13.964
please forgive yourself, please forgive yourself.

01:28:16.864 --> 01:28:24.084
Now, then we take our right hand on top of our forehead across like this and bend our head slowly.

01:28:26.084 --> 01:28:33.444
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

01:28:34.984 --> 01:28:40.444
Then we take our right hand on the back side of our head and push back our head as far as possible.

01:28:41.804 --> 01:28:48.124
This is the center where, just for your satisfaction,

01:28:48.644 --> 01:28:56.664
you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine power without feeling guilty, again.

01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:01.484
Now, you have to stretch your palm fully, like this

01:29:03.064 --> 01:29:07.004
and put the center of your palm on top of your head

01:29:07.444 --> 01:29:12.104
on to the fontanel bone, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:29:13.144 --> 01:29:19.564
Now, please put down your head as far as possible. Push back your fingers as far as possible

01:29:21.024 --> 01:29:28.664
and press it hard, your scalp, which you have to move clockwise, slowly, seven times.

01:29:37.644 --> 01:29:42.124
Push back your fingers - that's very important - push back your fingers so there's a better pressure.

01:29:43.484 --> 01:29:49.404
That's all you have to do. Bend your heads, please bend your heads, push back your fingers.

01:29:51.424 --> 01:29:58.564
That's all. This is all we have to do and now we have to close our eyes.

01:29:59.724 --> 01:30:06.724
Before closing our eyes, I would say, better take out your spectacles uh.. because it might help your eyesight also

01:30:07.624 --> 01:30:14.904
and please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Don't press very hard just

01:30:15.604 --> 01:30:21.864
ordinarily as we sleep, [UNCLEAR - YOU SEE IS?] very gentle way of closing the eyes.

01:30:24.544 --> 01:30:31.744
We have to have respect for ourselves and understanding that we are capable of achieving this higher state.

01:30:32.964 --> 01:30:37.664
So now please, put your left hand again towards Me, both the feet away from each other

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:42.444
and close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.

01:30:43.924 --> 01:30:47.704
[UNCLEAR] I think you can go now.

01:30:55.724 --> 01:31:03.704
Now, here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself to Me

01:31:04.064 --> 01:31:09.804
in your heart, not loudly - nothing to be said aloudly. So please, ask a question -

01:31:10.804 --> 01:31:15.344
you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you like -

01:31:15.784 --> 01:31:20.944
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question, three times, in your heart.

01:31:29.864 --> 01:31:32.904
I've already told you that

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:42.044
if you become the Spirit, you become your own guide and your own master.

01:31:42.424 --> 01:31:47.984
So now, please take your hand the upper portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side and press it

01:31:48.244 --> 01:31:53.644
and here you ask another fundamental question about yourself, three times, saying,

01:31:53.984 --> 01:31:58.624
"Mother, am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

01:32:04.604 --> 01:32:11.244
I must tell you I respect your freedom. If you don't want to have your realization, I cannot force you,

01:32:11.504 --> 01:32:18.364
if you don't want to know about the pure knowledge of the Divine, I cannot force it on you - you have to ask for it.

01:32:18.964 --> 01:32:26.644
So please, put your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left-hand side and here you please ask

01:32:28.384 --> 01:32:32.064
six times, because this center has got six petals,

01:32:34.884 --> 01:32:39.084
"Mother, please let me know the

01:32:39.484 --> 01:32:43.964
pure knowledge of the Divine." Please ask six times.

01:32:57.444 --> 01:33:05.824
As soon as you start asking this question, the Kundalini has started rising. It won't trouble you, it won't give you any shock.

01:33:06.264 --> 01:33:12.024
At the most some people might feel a little heat on their hands but it has started.

01:33:12.504 --> 01:33:17.764
So now, please raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:33:20.484 --> 01:33:27.564
Now these are the upper centers which we have to open with our full self-confidence.

01:33:28.684 --> 01:33:33.044
Here you have to say ten times with full self-confidence,

01:33:33.504 --> 01:33:40.144
"Mother, I am my own master." Please say this ten times,

01:33:40.344 --> 01:33:44.404
"Mother, I am my own master," with full confidence.

01:33:54.544 --> 01:34:01.304
At the very outset I've told [UNCLEAR - ME?] that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions,

01:34:02.024 --> 01:34:09.944
this intelligence, this ego or your conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:34:10.944 --> 01:34:16.224
So now, please raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence,

01:34:16.924 --> 01:34:22.944
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit." Please say it twelve times,

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:27.324
twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:34:44.424 --> 01:34:50.784
I have already request you to forgive yourself because

01:34:51.924 --> 01:34:59.544
this All-Pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of compassion and love

01:35:00.484 --> 01:35:04.944
and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:35:05.384 --> 01:35:12.284
and whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved in this ocean of forgiveness.

01:35:13.404 --> 01:35:19.804
So please forgive yourself, raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder please

01:35:20.644 --> 01:35:28.684
and here press it hard. Put your head towards your right and here, please, you have to say

01:35:30.804 --> 01:35:33.784
sixteen times,

01:35:34.384 --> 01:35:40.764
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times - it's very important.

01:35:54.144 --> 01:36:02.064
I've already told you, that you have to forgive everyone, in general, not thinking about them

01:36:02.484 --> 01:36:09.264
because if you don't forgive, this center of Agnya won't open out. As it is

01:36:09.624 --> 01:36:16.384
whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything but if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:22.484
So at this moment, try to understand that as it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving

01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:30.384
but at this moment if you forgive, this center will open and you will achieve what you have to really achieve -

01:36:31.184 --> 01:36:38.184
your Self-realization. So please, forgive all the people in general.

01:36:39.064 --> 01:36:44.524
Raise your right hand on top of your forehead and slowly put down your head

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:48.044
and here you have to say,

01:36:54.404 --> 01:36:57.784
not how many times but from your heart

01:36:58.364 --> 01:37:03.564
you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone

01:37:05.504 --> 01:37:11.884
in general." From your heart you have to say, not how many times.

01:37:16.524 --> 01:37:21.764
You have to now ask forgiveness from the Divine power

01:37:22.204 --> 01:37:27.844
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction.

01:37:34.184 --> 01:37:41.384
So now, take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head fully, push back.

01:37:42.984 --> 01:37:49.444
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

01:37:49.764 --> 01:37:55.024
without counting your mistakes - from your heart, not how many times,

01:37:56.184 --> 01:38:01.384
"Oh Divine power, if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me,"

01:38:03.064 --> 01:38:06.964
from your heart you have to say, not counting.

01:38:13.524 --> 01:38:21.464
Now the last center is very important, is the most important so stretch your palm fully

01:38:26.684 --> 01:38:32.184
Now, you have to put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

01:38:34.064 --> 01:38:38.304
properly and now bend your head as far as possible.

01:38:39.404 --> 01:38:43.644
Stretch back your fingers, stretch back your fingers.

01:38:48.884 --> 01:38:56.704
At this moment, I have to again say, that I cannot give you Self-realization unless and until you ask for it because

01:38:57.004 --> 01:39:02.124
I respect your freedom. So here, you move your scalp slowly, ten times,

01:39:03.264 --> 01:39:08.504
scalp by stretching your fingers out. Please put down your head, please put down your head.

01:39:08.844 --> 01:39:16.124
And now move your scalp, ten times - I'm sorry, seven times.

01:39:17.864 --> 01:39:20.864
Hmm.

01:39:23.304 --> 01:39:30.684
Seven times, slowly, clockwise saying, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:39:31.444 --> 01:39:37.784
Please move your scalp slowly, clockwise.

01:39:42.984 --> 01:39:47.484
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:39:53.564 --> 01:39:59.224
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:39:59.464 --> 01:40:05.544
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:40:08.764 --> 01:40:15.724
Now take down your hand and please open your eyes slowly.

01:40:18.924 --> 01:40:22.724
Put both the hands towards Me, like this, just like this

01:40:29.344 --> 01:40:34.384
and put the right hand towards Me and bend your head

01:40:36.484 --> 01:40:44.484
and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:40:53.344 --> 01:41:00.084
Hot or cold breeze might be coming, doesn't matter. It is hot means you have not forgiven

01:41:00.344 --> 01:41:04.304
yourself or forgiven others so it's still hot.

01:41:06.504 --> 01:41:13.244
Again, take your left hand towards Me like this, put down your head and see with your right hand

01:41:13.504 --> 01:41:17.944
if there's a cool or a hot breeze like

01:41:21.344 --> 01:41:28.144
vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please see with your right hand.

01:41:36.564 --> 01:41:43.024
Sometimes some people get it closer, sometimes they get it very far away, so you have to move your hand to see.

01:41:43.284 --> 01:41:49.904
If it is hot or cold doesn't matter but if you forgive just now yourself or others,

01:41:50.324 --> 01:41:57.564
it will definitely will become better and cooler. Alright, now again once more.

01:41:58.924 --> 01:42:04.084
Put your left hand towards Me again and put your right hand

01:42:04.424 --> 01:42:08.904
on top of your fontanel bone area and bend your head and now see yourself.

01:42:15.844 --> 01:42:20.984
Now, don't doubt yourself, that's the main point.

01:42:21.284 --> 01:42:24.784
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky like this

01:42:25.824 --> 01:42:30.344
and ask a question. Put your head up and ask

01:42:31.184 --> 01:42:35.004
one of the questions out of these three questions

01:42:37.324 --> 01:42:41.864
three times. "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:42:42.744 --> 01:42:48.604
Second, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of Divine love?"

01:42:49.404 --> 01:42:55.644
Third one, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:42:59.964 --> 01:43:08.084
It's alright - vibrations are coming from you to Me. Alright, put it down, please put it down.

01:43:10.664 --> 01:43:17.244
Now please put your hands like that. Now watch Me without thinking - you can do that - watch Me without thinking.

01:43:28.104 --> 01:43:34.364
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on the finger-tips or on the palms

01:43:34.604 --> 01:43:39.184
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:43:42.304 --> 01:43:45.244
[UNCLEAR - DID OR DIDN'T?] feel it? Good.

01:43:48.104 --> 01:43:53.964
May God bless you! Most of you, surprisingly! Everyone of you.

01:43:54.584 --> 01:43:59.584
One or two haven't got it but we'll see them. May God bless you all!

01:44:01.884 --> 01:44:07.884
Now you have to know what are these vibrations, what is this cool breeze which you have felt for the first time -

01:44:08.084 --> 01:44:16.064
is the All-Pervading power of Divine love - and how to use it, how to work it out - that's what you have to do and grow into it.

01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:23.704
But I see when I come, I don't know, everywhere people somehow believe Me very much and they come to My programs

01:44:23.964 --> 01:44:30.884
and afterwards they just disappear. Some of them, I don't know, they don't trust their own fellow-men who are realized souls here

01:44:31.144 --> 01:44:38.024
who know so much about sahaja yoga. So please, do not waste this

01:44:38.824 --> 01:44:45.724
awakening. Like Christ has said in His parable, that some seeds were sprouted

01:44:46.224 --> 01:44:53.604
but they were thrown into wasteland. In the same way it should not happen.

01:44:54.384 --> 01:45:01.144
There will, it is not like other people that they take introduction and then take money. You don't have to pay anything

01:45:01.764 --> 01:45:08.824
but you have to respect your Self-realization and you have to come to our

01:45:09.524 --> 01:45:15.864
centers where you will grow. As it is we don't take money we don't have

01:45:16.204 --> 01:45:23.004
palaces for you to come and meditate but they're nice places and very good

01:45:23.644 --> 01:45:30.024
evolved people here, who are humble, kind and compassionate. They'll tell you all about it,

01:45:30.284 --> 01:45:38.104
they're not going to keep any secrets. Some people didn't feel it - doesn't matter. It can be worked out for them, all of them, maybe some reason

01:45:38.324 --> 01:45:43.604
they haven't felt, so don't feel disappointed, there's nothing to be disappointed about

01:45:44.124 --> 01:45:52.124
there is all worked out. Also the people who have problems can come and see those people in the center -

01:45:52.724 --> 01:45:58.404
I'm sure, they will solve your problems, whether it is physical, mental, emotional, anything.

01:45:58.804 --> 01:46:05.604
They are doing great work in all over Australia. We have centers all over - please come

01:46:06.184 --> 01:46:14.164
in a humble way because we have to grow and groom and become the great tree of Divinity

01:46:14.884 --> 01:46:20.644
