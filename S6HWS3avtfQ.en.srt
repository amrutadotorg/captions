1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,029
I'm really sorry for getting so late...It
happens and whatever happens one has to accept.

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:11,360
That's how the Divine works.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,260
Everything has some reasons.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:30,230
Now, they must been able to explain to you
what centers we have within ourselves and

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:43,120
he has told you 
what is the mechanism within ourselves.

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:53,660
It is all built within us during the different
periods of our evolution.

7
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,630
Every center is built like that.

8
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:09,590
Now, all this is built, like a pathway.

9
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:18,119
By left and right you create the central path
of your ascent.

10
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:31,689
And when this pure energy of your desire ascends,
is awakened, then it pierces through the last

11
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:48,039
center what we call as Sahasrara, meaning
the thousand petalled centre, which is the

12
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:58,700
brain, we can say, or part of the brain which
covers the limbic area.

13
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:17,030
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty
and it resides in our heart.

14
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:28,020
When the Kundalini touches the Sahastrara,
the seat of the Spirit, which is reflected

15
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,240
in the heart, gets enlightened.

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:41,280
That doesn't mean the Spirit gets enlightened
but the attention is like a sari, which is

17
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:52,400
pushed in like this, [AND] when it touches,
it pierces through and the Spirit in the heart,

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:02,120
which has the seat here, starts entering into
our central nervous system.

19
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,070
So the first feeling you get is a cool breeze
on top of your head.

20
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,210
That's the first feeling.

21
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:20,600
Second feeling you get is All Pervading Power
because now you have entered into the subtle

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,350
area of your awareness.

23
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:33,670
Human awareness is gross first but when you
touch the Spirit, you become thoughtlessly

24
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:42,150
aware but there is no thought, the grossness
goes away because thoughts disappear.

25
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,320
And you become subtler.

26
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,480
This subtleness gives you certain powers.

27
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:04,640
The first power that you get is that you become,
your awareness becomes collectively conscious.

28
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:13,990
That you can feel another person on your fingertips
- that means you become absolutely aware.

29
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:23,800
Like I went today to Mexico and I could feel
the whole country, I knew about it before

30
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,449
but my attention was not so deeply there.

31
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:36,550
I could feel the whole country has a very
bad left side problem and the left side problem

32
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:45,950
is affecting even this area and the left side
problem you can feel it very clearly that

33
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:55,750
your left side becomes heavy and you feel
the heat in all your centers.

34
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:09,850
So you start feeling the atmosphere, the country,
the people and individual and yourself.

35
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,199
So you know the problem of a particular place.

36
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,310
I mean you may not feel that much in the beginning,
you may just feel yourself to begin with.

37
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:31,639
Then you start feeling others, so thus the
awareness grows more and more.

38
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:44,400
In the central nervous system you start feeling
the problems of other people, your own problems.

39
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,960
But it is not that you feel them as something,
which is painful or troublesome, but you feel

40
00:05:51,960 --> 00:06:03,439
them as little heat or sometimes little pain,
very little, as if you are recording it like

41
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,999
a barometer.

42
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:14,229
And when that happens you want to get rid
of it as if they are your own problem, and

43
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,689
if you know how to get rid of it you can do
it.

44
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:24,809
That's what I was doing and that's how I'm
late, something on the collective.

45
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:34,520
If you are working on something you want to
finish the job and then you want to attend

46
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,680
to another.

47
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,360
Don't want to leave something half done.

48
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:50,870
For human beings it is difficult in the beginning,
because from human awareness you are rising

49
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:59,120
to super human awareness or you can call it
to super awareness, into a subtler awareness.

50
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,939
So first the awareness is gross and then your
awareness becomes subtler.

51
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:19,889
But with that you do not fell in any way uncomfortable
or upset, because you become extremely powerful.

52
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:30,500
Such power of compassion, that you don't feel
anything, no pain, no problems, the illusions

53
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,110
disappear completely.

54
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,599
There's no more illusion in the mind.

55
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:48,150
Like people say that when you face something
you are filled with the greed, or greed or

56
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,150
lust.

57
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,360
But when your eyes become pure, there is no
greed or lust.

58
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:10,449
But what happens that you start feeling the
oneness with another thing, whatever it is,

59
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,169
in a way that it is joy giving.

60
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:23,740
Like you see someone, an attractive person,
there is no sensation of [BERSERK] feelings

61
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:38,630
for that person but the sensation just disappears
and you start feeling the joy of the creation

62
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,979
of that person or the thing.

63
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,389
Like in Mexico, people have made so many things
with hand.

64
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:54,550
If you watch them you might think how much
it will cost, what will be the price, who

65
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,930
has made it.

66
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:05,630
But if there is no thought then you see something,
which looks very joyous, because you can feel

67
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,160
the vibrations.

68
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,750
And you know somebody has made it, who might
have been a Realized soul, who might have

69
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:22,529
been a very great devotee of God, might have
been a person who must have thought that:

70
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,730
"This is your creation, oh God."

71
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:35,589
Such a person might have made with that feeling
which is to be gratified and you feel that

72
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,300
we should take it.

73
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:44,269
The matter has only one capacity that it gives
joy in giving to others, so that you can express

74
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,040
your happiness into it.

75
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,690
So you become very subtly aware of the matter,
that you start understanding the matter, what

76
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,910
it means and what is the use of a particular
thing.

77
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:06,040
In the same way, when you meet people, new
people, absolutely never known, you know what

78
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,370
are their needs, what problems they have,
on a wider scale, on a collective scale, and

79
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:27,800
also you know one simple thing that there
are people in Mexico, who are seeking God,

80
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,920
who are to be helped, who are to be given
something that they want.

81
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,540
They may not be so much aware of it but we
become aware of them.

82
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:48,069
And a kind of a rapport of a very subtle type
is established and you get attracted towards

83
00:10:48,069 --> 00:11:00,420
other people not through any lust or greed
or any purpose but in oneness with the joy

84
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,210
that they have within themselves, the joy
of the Spirit.

85
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:16,699
You look at them and you feel: "This person
is such a wonderful person".

86
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:17,899
How do you know?

87
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:23,680
You start feeling the cool vibrations in your
hand from that person.

88
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,709
And you just enjoy that person for that person's
sake, not for anything, whether poor, rich,

89
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:34,790
good looking, bad looking, doesn't matter.

90
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:40,290
You approach the Spirit of another person
because you have become the Spirit.

91
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:48,940
People talk of big things, of organizing peace
missions, this mission, that mission, to create

92
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,470
a better relationship.

93
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:58,819
All relationships, which are at a gross level
create problems, because there is some sort

94
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02,820
of a lurking selfishness behind it.

95
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:10,300
But once it becomes the spiritual relationship
you just enjoy the other person without getting

96
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:21,459
into any discussion about what is your gain,
what is you are going to achieve through going

97
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:23,759
nearer to that personality.

98
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:31,250
Thus you become the receiver of the joy.

99
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:41,800
Like a lake, which is ripleless, which is
absolutely quiet and looks like a mirror.

100
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:55,360
It reflects all that is created round it completely
and emits complete joy of the creation.

101
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,709
In the same way the heart, which is filled
with the light of the Spirit, reflects the

102
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:11,890
complete joy of the creation of another person.

103
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,540
Whatever it has in a subtle way you enjoyed.

104
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:29,660
Then the time, you don't see, you go beyond
time, you go beyond time, you are not bothered

105
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,889
about time.

106
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:39,160
Everything has got a proper timing and you
start understanding that this is the time

107
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,600
it was to be.

108
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:48,300
You don't become a slave of time, you don't
become slave of any habits, you don't become

109
00:13:48,300 --> 00:14:03,959
slave of any temptations, but you enjoy the
complete freedom of enjoying the joy.

110
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:15,519
For example we are very tight thinking what
is to be done next, what this has to be, but

111
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,069
then you start seeing the purpose of your
life.

112
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:27,779
Like one day we had to have a Puja or a kind
of a worship.

113
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:36,380
They said: "We'll start at about 9 o'clock"
as it is today something happened.

114
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,490
And I said: "Alright, we'll start at 9.00."

115
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,670
But I knew 9.00 was not all right so I reached
the place at 11.00.

116
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,529
Of course those who had to stay, would've
stayed on.

117
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:57,300
Because you need people who understand that
time has no meaning when it is the Spirit.

118
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,480
And I said: "Now, just see the Panchanga,
that book which we consult for timing."

119
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,170
They said: "Today is the dark night Damasya."

120
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,079
"And when does it end?"

121
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,600
"Just now."

122
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,319
I said: "That's it."

123
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:20,180
So everything, the timing, everything has
to be worked out according to the need of

124
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,709
the Spirit and not need of the gross.

125
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:34,420
When that happens you [GO or KNOW] smoothly
and understandingly the whole pattern of the

126
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,000
Divine how it works out.

127
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:48,529
And that is how you understand the dynamism
of time, because you live in the present not

128
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,319
in the future or in the past.

129
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,120
Actually the past doesn't exist and future
has not come, we don't know what future is.

130
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,129
To come in the present you have to be the
Spirit.

131
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:09,660
And when you are in the Spirit then you realize
that this present is the reality, the rest

132
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,699
is a myth.

133
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:22,519
When the Kundalini rises She passes attention
into an area or She penetrates into an area

134
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:32,790
where there is silence because a thought rises
and falls off, another thought rises and falls

135
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,790
off.

136
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,180
In between these two thoughts this area exists,
of the present.

137
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:48,579
Now...But if I say you stop at this point,
to be at this point, you cannot.

138
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:55,570
Your mind is jumping either on the past or
on the future.

139
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:06,829
But the Kundalini is the only thing that stops
you at present moment so that you don't consider

140
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:16,100
the past and the future but you enjoy the
present, the complete dynamism of the present

141
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,880
and you are effective, you are dynamic.

142
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:31,220
You can do thousand and one thing, which normally
you cannot do and you are surprised how it

143
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,360
works out.

144
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,890
The Divine has Its own plans, has Its own
understanding and we cannot make the Divine

145
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,690
to work as we want.

146
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:49,500
We have to accept whatever the Divine does
and manages and then we see the miracles of

147
00:17:49,500 --> 00:18:00,039
the Divine and we are surprised how efficient
It is, how beautiful It is, like a machine.

148
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:09,470
We feel the efficiency of the Divine but above
all we feel the compassion, the love, the

149
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,360
understanding of the Divine.

150
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
But first we must rise up to that.

151
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,140
And for that one has to grow in the awareness
of the Spirit.

152
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:27,710
If we cannot develop the awareness of the
Spirit, we loose that magnitude which we have

153
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,970
to achieve.

154
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:39,590
So what is to be respected is the Spirit after
Realization, because it gives you the truth.

155
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:45,529
To understand the truth you have to be the
Spirit, otherwise whatever you understand

156
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:49,350
is falsehood, is not the truth.

157
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,850
Because of your mental projection you think
that that is the truth, is not so.

158
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:06,710
For example now, if I am sitting on this chair
you won't know anytime that I ever sat on

159
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,070
this chair.

160
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:15,100
But supposing there's a Realized soul who
comes round, immediately he will know that

161
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,330
there was someone like Me.

162
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,529
For example I say that Mozart was a Realized
soul.

163
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,230
How do I know?

164
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,460
He's dead now.

165
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:33,940
Because you can feel it on vibrations that
he was a Realized soul.

166
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,640
I say: "Abraham Lincoln was a Realized soul."

167
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,159
Not because the way he lived or what he did,
that what just an expression or was the symptom

168
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:53,370
of his greatness but because when you think
of him you get cool breeze in your hands,

169
00:19:53,370 --> 00:20:00,520
tremendously cool breeze, soothing, which
crawls over you: "Oh, that's Abraham Lincoln."

170
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:11,090
We do not know where we spend our time, what
people are important to us till we are the

171
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,090
Spirit.

172
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:21,320
We waste our time catering to something absolutely
useless, and then suddenly we discover: "Oh,

173
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,950
God, what a waste of time, what a waste of
energy, what a waste of money.

174
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,779
This man was a cheat.

175
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,549
He cheated me.

176
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,720
This work was all falsehood.

177
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,779
Why did I waste my time there?

178
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,750
After Realization you become the absolute.

179
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:49,100
There is no relative value, you do not judge
anything relatively, you just know what is

180
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:56,610
absolute and once you know the absolute you
are quite sure about it, there's no wavering.

181
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:04,390
Thus you become an extremely powerful person
and you know the truth about everything.

182
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:12,380
Now the truth is very simple that you are
the Spirit and you are not this body, you

183
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:19,950
are not this mind and you are not this ego
or your conditionings but you are the free

184
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,290
Spirit, that's the truth is.

185
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:35,100
But it is not just a mental truth but is actually
so and has to be actualized.

186
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,500
The third thing that happens to you apart
from your awareness becoming the truth, the

187
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,970
complete knowledge, you become the source
of joy, not that you only receive the joy

188
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:56,400
but you become the source of joy, the source
of bliss and the source of peace.

189
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,340
Wherever such a person goes, it just sooths.

190
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:09,640
Yesterday you saw a lady, she had very stiff
fingers, she couldn't move them... and as

191
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,580
soon as I said: "What's wrong with your fingers?"

192
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,539
she started moving them.

193
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,110
She was amazed how she started moving.

194
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,600
Just my attention, just one question.

195
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,169
I said: "What's wrong with your hands?"

196
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,559
she just started moving.

197
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,070
She said: "Am I cured?"

198
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:35,770
First she said is some nervous trouble and
then she saw: "Oh, it's moving, it's all right,

199
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,770
cured."

200
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,770
How?

201
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:42,400
Because you get that power within yourself
of compassion, which doesn't expect any thing,

202
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,240
it just works and acts silently.

203
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,850
Just paying attention to that person itself,
it's sufficient.

204
00:22:51,850 --> 00:23:01,059
Just one glance at that person can save that
person from any kind of malady.

205
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:10,320
It works but of course it is true also those
who are not deserving at all, those who are

206
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:21,250
crooked people, those who are cruel, say for
example Hitler, you cannot give him Realization,

207
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,320
can you?

208
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,309
He has to suffer.

209
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:37,640
So, also these illusions that we have about
people, [THAT OH], we should be kind to everyone,

210
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,940
we should be nice.

211
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:46,169
The kindness of the Divine to the crooks is
not the way we look at it.

212
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,470
The kindness to the crooks is punishment.

213
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,320
It's a wrathful God.

214
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,570
It punishes crooks.

215
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:03,240
Many people feel that, I mean it's a [MEREST]
mental attitude to say that everything is

216
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,140
illusion, so crookery is also an illusion.

217
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,399
It is not.

218
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:18,330
For you it is just a mental attitude, that's
all.

219
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:24,519
For the people who are in the boat is all
right to say that the ocean is an illusion

220
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,890
but not for the people who are in the water.

221
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:36,160
That's just a mental problem that they think
it's not an illusion or a illusion, it is

222
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,840
not the fact with them, it's not actually
with them.

223
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:48,750
But once you rise above that, to you it is
an illusion but to the Divine it's a duty

224
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,580
to correct it.

225
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,090
And Divine looks after you.

226
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,299
All the blessings of the Divine starts showering
upon you and you are amazed how it has worked,

227
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:03,840
how it has helped you, how it has done good
to you.

228
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:12,690
You are amazed how all the things that you
desire you get, your desires change, you ask

229
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,019
for something and you just get it.

230
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:23,570
Because these desires that are there are based
on something that Divine wants.

231
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:30,590
Like one we had a doctor who was working in
Riad, and he had a feeling that he should

232
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:37,679
go to Abba, which is a place very much down
trodden and where he thought Sahaja Yoga will

233
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,500
work better.

234
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,500
So he was very anxious, he wrote a very anxious
letter to Me, that: "Mother, please see that

235
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,019
I go to Abba."

236
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,799
That letter he had just posted, he tried his
level best, he couldn't do it.

237
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:55,170
Had just posted, I never received it, even
then he got the appointment.

238
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,390
So, the whole attitude towards life changes.

239
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,320
Like today if you ask Sahaja Yogis, they said:
"Mother, we must go to Mexico."

240
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,169
I said: "How far is?"

241
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:06,279
"Fifteen, twenty minutes."

242
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,279
"All right."

243
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,210
The reason is they wanted Me to put My attention
to Mexico.

244
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,049
They are not limited to America only.

245
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,529
Now, Mexico is important to them.

246
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:20,049
Let's do how we work it out.

247
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:23,090
Otherwise people could have had some other
desires, other things.

248
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:30,270
Little desires like having a house, having
a car, having a job, these are all fulfilled

249
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,270
in no time.

250
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,970
There's no problem on them.

251
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:40,679
Krishna has said: [Hindi talk], when you get
Yoga, when you get Realization, you get your

252
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:48,840
well being, your health improves, your mind
improves and last of all you become the giver

253
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,000
of gifts to others, in the sense wherever
you are, you are auspiciousness.

254
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,460
You are so pure that your purity fills the
atmosphere with auspiciousness and this auspiciousness

255
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:19,220
when acts, you are amazed how people are helped
and how people are granted these beautiful

256
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,130
blessings through you.

257
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,840
And you get aware of it, you understand it.

258
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,480
That's what we can learn from the lives of
Christ and all other such great personalities

259
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,399
who came on this earth, how they worked out
things for others and how they granted them

260
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,529
whatever they desired.

261
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:46,809
You become absolutely dynamic as far as the
creativity is concerned, you become great

262
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:52,580
creators if your interest is in that, you
become great healers as they call it, but

263
00:27:52,580 --> 00:28:00,389
not that you heal persons by charging them
money or talking about money, but only being

264
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:05,279
in the presence of these people you just heal
them.

265
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,049
You become the source of all corrections,
but the corrections are not mental that you

266
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,720
give a lecture to them: "Now you don't do
this any, don't do that any, you shouldn't

267
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
do that."

268
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,960
Just works out.

269
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:29,400
Just people just melt into that compassion
which you are.

270
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,289
You don't have to fight anyone, you don't
have to struggle.

271
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:34,730
It just works out.

272
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,669
It's so powerful.

273
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:45,820
The most powerful power is of love, of pure
love and this purity when emits through you,

274
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,090
you are amazed that why people have not used
this power of love.

275
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,550
They have only used the power of hatred.

276
00:28:53,550 --> 00:29:03,950
All these problems drop out, your family problems,
your city problems, your national problems,

277
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,450
your world problems all drop out.

278
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:16,450
Because all problems come from human beings
who are yet very selfish, very secluded, very

279
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:22,460
abnormally attached to limitations.

280
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,909
The whole thing works out so beautifully and
we have to create such personalities.

281
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:34,299
For that God has sent on this Earth great
people.

282
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:43,070
I see everywhere, they are very great people,
very special category of people who understand

283
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:49,580
that they have to play a role in the working
of the Divine, and they work it out in such

284
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:57,539
a manner, that they contribute to the well-being
of the whole Universe.

285
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:06,190
America, I must say, has been the least concerned
country about this, I must say.

286
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,200
Is the poorest as far as evolution is concerned.

287
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,600
I'm sorry, but has been so.

288
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,520
They have had all kinds of gurus here, all
kinds of things but in Sahaja Yoga I find

289
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,020
them, they are not there.

290
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm quite surprised at it, that their interests
are so funny, that they have such limited

291
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,049
interest in life or what I don't understand.

292
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:41,639
I've been to this country many a times, of
course not so much as I've been to other countries

293
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:49,110
it was every time I have come, I felt that
they have to still come up to a point to see

294
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:54,720
that truth has to be accepted, is to be received.

295
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:02,960
Because if the truth is exposed to people
who are not yet ready, maybe it will be all

296
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
lost.

297
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:15,390
It's like the story of Christ where He describes
the seeds, which fell on the rock, some fell

298
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,320
on the right ground.

299
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,970
This is what it is and I face it up.

300
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:31,240
I feel sometimes that such a great country
like India, which is now awakening very nicely

301
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,019
to Sahaja Yoga, which was just a slave country
for 300 years.

302
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:43,950
Or we can say there are countries like Italy,
which are very important but were sort of

303
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:50,460
always neglected, treated as something useless,
are coming up, because Spirit is higher than

304
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,620
anything else.

305
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,429
Politics, economics is nothing for Spirit.

306
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:57,950
Now, let us see what happens in America.

307
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,669
Let us see what is going to awaken them.

308
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:03,980
I don't know what is going to [STIRR] them.

309
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,080
Because they are also placed in the Vishuddhi
chakra.

310
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,270
This is the center where America is placed.

311
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,389
This is the most important center also.

312
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:26,500
And if this center is not going to be awakened
then one has to see to it that something happens.

313
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:33,420
The Divine might rock and shock and tell you
that better accept to your spiritual life,

314
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
is important.

315
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:48,860
Is very important that we should hold the
Divine in our arms and try to accept that.

316
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:57,510
People don't realize it, that it is not proper
to live with mundane life, day to day life

317
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:06,559
but should think of the wider repercussions
that can have on the people who do not think

318
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:15,940
of the calamities that can fall on upon them
if they don't accept the truth.

319
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,190
Truth must be accepted.

320
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,670
You see the countries, which have vanished,
like Romans who were such great countries.

321
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,840
They had a fall.

322
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Why?

323
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,880
Because they took to a life which was destructive,
to such a limit that I've heard some people

324
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,180
saying: "We, we have a right to destroy ourselves."

325
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,049
You have no right at all.

326
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:41,639
You cannot create yourself and you cannot
destroy yourself.

327
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:48,899
So one has to realize that if we have any
right that is one to be the Spirit, to be

328
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:57,909
that power, which can make others the Spirit,
which can make others the source of joy, what

329
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:58,909
they are.

330
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:01,100
This is the epitome of our evolution.

331
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:09,580
This is the last judgment as I told you and
the Kundalini is going to judge you, Kundalini

332
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,819
is going to judge you.

333
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:17,750
It is not anybody is going to weigh you and
say: "You are such a weight so you are all

334
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,050
right" or "Your brain has so much weight so
you are all right."

335
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,660
But the judgment will come to you when your
Kundalini will rise.

336
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,440
You will judge yourself.

337
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:37,250
And you will judge yourself by denying or
accepting the Spirithood, the oneness with

338
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,210
the Divine, that's a fact, I must declare
it to you.

339
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,819
Because that is what is very important to
understand and as a Mother I feel very concerned,

340
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:56,040
very concerned that such a big population
should not go a waste, just a waste because

341
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:07,420
they could not realize the importance of their
being, of their own life, of their own role

342
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,109
as spiritual beings.

343
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,609
May God bless you all.

344
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:20,089
The lecture can go on because on the Spirit
I must have given at least, I don't know,

345
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:24,619
about at least hundred lectures so far, only
on the subject of Spirit.

346
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,800
So it's an endless job.

347
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,080
And every time I say something people say:
"Mother you have said something very new."

348
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,750
So the knowledge is endless but you become
the knowledge, you yourself become the knowledge

349
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,960
and you start understanding it.

350
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:46,800
Only thing is you must have as a duty, respect
for yourself and the importance of responsibility

351
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,869
that you have to be the Spirit.

352
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:54,730
That's why you have come on this earth as
human beings, at this time.

353
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:02,099
This time is very precious and it's not a
fashion to be a seeker but it's something

354
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:05,510
that has to happen to all of you.

355
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,200
Yesterday you people asked me many questions
and I think I answered most of them.

356
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:19,730
Some of them were very good questions but
some of them were a little very simple I think,

357
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,480
but nobody was aggressive...

358
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,930
But on the whole I think that maybe San Diego
is a place from where we may be able to save

359
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,020
America.

360
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,160
I didn't have any program anywhere in Los
Angeles or anything, but I came to San Diego.

361
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:46,010
But you have to know that if this is the place
we have to get people who are of that quality.

362
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:52,119
I don't know when are we going to get them
but I hope we get those people of that quality.

363
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,190
Even a small nail can hold a sari.

364
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:03,440
In the same way a little place looking like
San Diego can save America.

365
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:13,560
May God bless you all.

366
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,420
So we'll have the experience now.

367
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,000
It will take about five minutes for you because
if all the chakras are discussed already the

368
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,500
attention is on that.

369
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,710
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

370
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,300
(It's better.

371
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:45,770
You've done a good job.)

372
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,260
Just put your hands towards Me.

373
00:37:49,260 --> 00:38:04,960
Just like this.

374
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:12,810
Left.

375
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:23,200
Now, left hand towards Me and right hand towards
the Mother Earth.

376
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,430
We'll give you a balance.

377
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,859
You need not close your eyes just now, let's
see.

378
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:31,740
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

379
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,359
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,
conditioning, subconscious and collective

380
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:41,450
subconscious, very much at work here.

381
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:49,990
But also is an emotional side.

382
00:38:49,990 --> 00:39:02,280
Now put your right hand towards Me and left
hand towards the sky.

383
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:14,950
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards
Me like this.

384
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:24,730
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

385
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:39,280
You are already thoughtless, there's no thought,
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

386
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:54,350
(Much better.)

387
00:39:54,350 --> 00:40:09,420
Are you?

388
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:24,490
Let's see.

389
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:39,550
All right?

390
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:56,880
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

391
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:08,089
All right, now put your left hand on top of
your head, just here, fontanel bone area.

392
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:11,780
Are you feeling?

393
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,700
It's a very subtle thing.

394
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,330
Are you?

395
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,960
Pay attention.

396
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,590
(Working out.)

397
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,900
Good?

398
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,530
All right.

399
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,480
Now, change over.

400
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,940
See the left hand, with the right hand.

401
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,180
Just pay attention there, see.

402
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,900
Believe that you are the Spirit.

403
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:55,780
So just you have to say in your heart: "I
am the Spirit", in your heart.

404
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:03,619
Say it seven times, it will work out.

405
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:04,619
Releasing.

406
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,510
Is it all right?

407
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:11,170
Are you feeling the heat coming out?

408
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,470
Little heat.

409
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:21,110
All right, now turn, change, see now.

410
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:31,340
Right Swadhishthan.

411
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,340
All right?

412
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,340
[UNCLEAR]

413
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:41,770
Now, just see, if it is working cool breeze...

414
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,619
Feel it.

415
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,579
Just put your hands like this.

416
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:54,020
It's good?

417
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:02,910
You are all thoughtless.

418
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:11,780
If you see, there's no thought in your mind.

419
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,050
And complete silence.

420
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:18,000
Enjoy this.

421
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,360
This moment is going to transform your life,
take it from Me.

422
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:35,369
You may not realize today but you'll realize
it very soon.

423
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:37,920
Stop.

424
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,670
Have faith in yourself, that's the main thing.

425
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,619
It's beautiful.

426
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:55,349
Now, all those who are feeling the cool breeze
in the hand or in the head, from the head,

427
00:43:55,349 --> 00:44:00,930
please raise your hands, all, both the hands
like this.

428
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:04,400
Could you believe it?

429
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,109
Most of you.

430
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:09,160
May God bless you.

431
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Except for one or two.

432
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,900
Maybe you have come for the first time.

433
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,310
Have you come for the first time?

434
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,970
All right, maybe, we'll see you, it's not
difficult.

435
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:22,770
Today it's very powerful day, is worked out.

436
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,790
Now know that you've found it but establish
yourself.

437
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,119
This is very important is to establish.

438
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,420
Luckily you have a very good center here.

439
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:40,910
And we have to work it out through San Diego,
from this side and from New Jersey from the

440
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:41,910
other side.

441
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,069
We have to work it out.

442
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:50,690
All of you must remember that you have got
your Realization.

443
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:57,640
I don't want to take any promises from you
because I depend on your Spirit.

444
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,710
Respect it.

445
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,730
Respect your Realization.

446
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:01,730
Respect yourself.

447
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:08,740
Now you will find you have a purpose in life
and just understand how this Divine power

448
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:20,800
works and how we can manage it and control
it, how we can maneuver it and how it works

449
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:28,280
in the larger interest, in the higher interest,
in the nobler interest, in the righteous life.

450
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,130
You become that and others also become.

451
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,020
May God bless you.

452
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:46,630
It's a time that clicks and that's why one
should understand why somebody's late, why

453
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,780
somebody's early.

454
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,849
All right.

455
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:54,720
These two gentlemen and there are some ladies
here who haven't got the Realization so I

456
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:10,309
hope the Sahaja Yogis will help them but I'll
come down to shake hands with you.

457
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,270
Those who haven't got Realization please raise
your hands and don't wear your shoes.

458
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,410
Just they'll come down and see for yourself.

459
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,589
Please be seated.

460
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:19,610
Just five minutes more.

461
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,720
Five minutes.

462
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,160
Don't be in such a great hurry.

463
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,069
(What she say?)

464
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:34,470
I'm sorry, I'm just saying that you wait for
five minutes, I'm coming down and we'll see,

465
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,740
those who haven't got Realization will get
it.

466
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,920
Don't be in a hurry.

467
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,750
What's the time now?

468
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:52,360
I better ask because you all seem to be very
much in a hurry.

469
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:59,100
For what?

470
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:12,450
Do you know I travel all over the world and
I mean you know I don't earn anything out

471
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:42,330
of it, as such money wise and tomorrow I go
to New York, then to Switzerland, then to

472
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:58,140
Spain, all over the places.

473
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:36,490
But how do I do it?

474
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:53,109
Because I'm paid in the way what we call is
beyond human awareness: the joy.

475
00:48:53,109 --> 00:49:00,099
And that's what one has to achieve.

476
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:19,660
So don't be 

477
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:26,700
in 
a hurry.

478
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:52,119
Nothing is going to run away from San Diego,
I can tell you.

479
00:49:52,119 --> 00:50:02,430
Let's see.

480
00:50:02,430 --> 00:52:03,039
(They are not so speedy, they are not so speedy
like New York...)
