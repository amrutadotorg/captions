00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.409
Seeker 1: This is my first time
Seeker 2: I'm very confused. I'm always

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.603
Seeker 2: thinking about something and the
next thing ahead and a lot of the things,

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:15.867
Seeker 2: so, I'm interested about the sort of to my help so
Interviewer: Good!

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.382
Seeker 2: but I'm not sure, I'm not sure
what that's going to work

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:21.893
Seeker: Find it hard to just not
think about anything?

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:27.923
Yogini: Purpose of today is to learn how
to meditate and we'll try to do that and

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:32.568
give you the experience of meditation
with minimum talking, so forgive us

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:36.644
if we don't give you too much explanation
of everything because that's not relevant.

00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:40.668
The relevant part is what 
we feel within ourself.

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:46.726
Seeker: I didn't feel it at first. Checked
next door. He's obviously brought into this

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:51.014
and he's set out into doing abroad. I didn't
have my hand far enough away and I felt

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:57.999
the tingling funny sensation in both
of my middle fingers and enough a while.

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:04.289
Another Seeker: I could feel a coolness
between my head - not a breeze but a coolness.

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:10.889
It wasn't particularly in my fingers but it was in
the palm of my hand which I thought was interesting.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:16.340
Seeker 1: It felt, kind of quite nice, quite
relaxing. I'm not sure I was getting any

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:21.692
chakras going anywhere or anything like
that. I'm a little skeptical to be honest.

00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:25.786
Seeker: I felt tingling in my hand.
Seeker: Excellent. It felt really very good.

00:01:25.786 --> 00:01:27.801
Seeker : Felt it?
Seeker: Yes

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.960
Seeker: Very refreshing. Absence of
high [UNCLEAR]

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.090
Seeker: Very relaxing!
Seeker: It was good to switch my mind off, I guess.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.910
Seeker: It happened quite spontaneously, not
for a long time, just for a short time, just in a wind.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.310
Seeker: First my mind was still going
through things but then, you know, we had

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.988
got three sessions of us and the last one
I felt, as if I was really, there much the time

00:01:53.988 --> 00:02:02.028
I wasn't drifting off for long today to have
that way. It was just nothing. That was wonderful!

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:10.309
Seeker: It felt quiet in my head and that
surprises me. You know, I think there's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:15.577
too much going on in my head, so its
very calm and quiet moment which is good.

00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:22.958
Seeker: I'm really, I just [UNCLEAR] I was
good, practice that and enjoy enhancing that.

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:28.627
Seeker: Interestingly, I felt calm as I 
came into the room and then it became

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:36.922
quieter and quieter. So, whether I'm just in
the right place, right now in learning this.

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:41.541
It just felt like it all just fell into
place, which was great.

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:46.781
Seeker: I generally am quite stressed and
I'm feeling very, very relaxed at the moment,

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:52.711
so I'm hoping that I'll be disciplined enough
to put it into practice when I get help.
