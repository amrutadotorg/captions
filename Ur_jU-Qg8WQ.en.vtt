00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.220
Nice to be back again in Hampstead.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.220
I always enjoyed Hampstead

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.260
because,as I have told, you in London,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.560
many people who were

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.380
great spiritual lived in this area.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.540
They preferred it to other places.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.600
So I believe that many people who live in this area

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.800
must be also spiritual,

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:12.960
must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-Realisation.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.480
It’s a very important time: when you are born.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.140
It’s the most important in the history of the universe.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.000
You are created a human being to become your Spirit.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.440
There’s nothing in between.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.300
If you have intelligence, pure intelligence,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.440
you can see through all that.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.180
You have to test your intelligence on this.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.960
Whatever we think and whatever we conceive

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:53.420
and whatever we try to organise ourselves into,

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.180
mostly comes from our conditionings,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.560
not from the Spirit, because we have not touched the Spirit.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:08.360
But innately we have got a sense to know

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.760
that these are very important times;

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.920
that there must be something great in the atmosphere,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.740
that there are so many people who are seeking.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.800
It’s something remarkable. If this misses your attention,

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.800
that means you are not alert.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.360
There are people of all types, all kinds. But seekers

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.800
of this calibre have been very few.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.960
Now England has its own problems,

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.220
and London has its own peculiarities.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.860
Despite the fact I have been in London for about

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600
eight and a half years,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.860
I feel that

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.900
the reception of the truth has been very, very poor.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.000
Maybe, I am luckier than others.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.980
It’s the conditioning, again I would say, of another type

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.760
that prevails [in] the minds.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.660
First we had, about twenty-five years back

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.300
the conditioning of the science,

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.800
but scientists themselves have refuted it.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.880
They themselves have challenged the science

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.860
and they themselves know that it’s not such a happy affair,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.780
just to be a scientist.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.080
Then comes the intellectuals.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.520
The books started pouring in, in the market:

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.220
all kinds of books.You can read about everything.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.220
Everyone knows about everything!

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.640
And once you start reading about them,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.760
you conceive something;

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.700
your conceptions are built about the truth also.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.140
The thing you have never seen,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.940
the thing you have never felt, you cannot conceive it,

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.020
it is to be seen.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.340
Like I had never seen Hampstead before,

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.200
and the first idea of my husband was to buy a house in Hampstead

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.700
it’s surprising! I was very happy at that point.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.860
So I said, “Let’s go and see!”

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.160
Without seeing it, if I had some conception about it,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.920
it would have been wrong.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.880
My seeing is different from others, I must say.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.260
I liked the place immensely,

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.220
but he,from the point of view [of] distances and all of that he said,

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.940
“It’s not good.” And naturally his ideas prevailed;doesn’t matter.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:54.660
But seeing, itself, makes you understand.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.040
But what is Self-Realisation? It’s not only seeing.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.600
When you come to Hampstead you don’t see it.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.040
You feel it.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:15.120
You feel it. Now many people say you can feel it, but the idea of feeling is also quite conditioned.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.440
Like, some children like to cuddle a little doll.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.200
They feel the doll. But God knows how far they feel it.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.380
They might be feeling it physically,

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:34.180
or emotionally also they might be feeling some sort of a security with the doll, maybe.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.920
Psychologically they might be deriving some joy out of that

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.880
doll itself.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.520
Or maybe the image,

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.760
which has some sort of an attraction

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.920
of some sort of a thing that is built within their unconscious,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920
that they feel so close to that.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.260
But a person who is a realised-soul

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.940
does not feel a doll that way, even if it’s a child.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.460
It’s surprising. You must watch a realised child

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.260
getting to a doll. It’s very surprising.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.840
For example, I bought two dolls from London for my grandchildren and they rejected completely.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.860
They said, “What sort of dolls these are?” I said, “Why?”

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.160
“They are unhappy!” I said, “They are not unhappy.”

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.200
“No, see their lips!”

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.360
You see, the lips of the dolls here is all just like a duck’s beak.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:37.260
They said, “They have resentment. They are angry.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.520
They are not realised!”

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.420
That’s it!

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:51.100
If you are a happy person then the whole get-up of your face changes,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.300
and they could see, they could feel it.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.300
They rejected: “We don’t want these dolls.”

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.940
And then next time when I had to go I had to go

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.820
round the whole places. First of all they were plastics;

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.820
so plastics they don’t like.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.220
They don’t like plastic. Somehow realised people don’t like plastics,automatically.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.300
They wouldn’t wear plastic clothes,  they wouldn’t wear nylon clothes,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.300
they wouldn’t wear mixed clothes: very difficult.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.340
They must have cotton clothes. Even if they have one, they’ll wear that the whole day,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.820
morning, evening, every time, the same thing.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.900
You see, it’s a different sensitivity which we do not have before Realisation.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.420
They have a different sensitivity.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:38.740
And the coefficients of a doll which emits vibrations they like.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.560
But it’s very difficult to get such dolls nowadays; impossible.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.340
Because where are these artists who are realised-souls who used to make dolls?

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.820
I have seen they make their own dolls,

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.320
out of something:. sometimes my saris they will use or something.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.800
And sleep with those.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.800
It’s something to be understood that, after Realisation,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.140
the thing you feel is not what you feel through your heart or through your conditioning of ages, also, maybe.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.140
Like if you have been living with a woman

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.820
for many years with blue eyes,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.140
then you may like a doll with blue eyes. You may,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.720
because you have that image into your head.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.940
You may like. Or you may have a nanny of with blue eyes

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.680
you may like a doll like that.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.500
It’s all psychological.  It’s conditioning very deep in you.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.080
But Spirit has no conditioning. It’s a free thing.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:42.980
What does it feel? It feels the joy of Creation,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.780
which we cannot.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.920
Before Realisation we cannot feel.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.500
You see, when we see something, where is the joy?

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.080
Now, for example, if a fussy man comes here he’ll say,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.500
“Oh, God, what a thing! I have to take out my shoes

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.700
and sit like that! And the chairs were horrible!

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.480
And couldn’t sit: very uncomfortable!

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.480
And the colour was all white.”

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.720
He couldn’t bear it.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.960
And I don’t know: all sorts of things.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.320
The thoughts will start.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.040
If you buy something – same thing.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.800
If you see something – same thing.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.760
There’s no joy!

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.900
We just start thinking!

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.480
Or if not, to avoid that, you may start a poetry about it.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:35.280
It’s sometimes so artificial, some of the poetry.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.320
So artificially put there that you can see it clearly

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:45.360
clearly that this man is just a sadist, wants to make you cry.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.640
Like Lord Byron!

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.620
You can see it so clearly that this man has no sincerity of purpose.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.480
He’s not sincere.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.020
That sincerity you cannot feel

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.120
unless and until you are realised

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.220
because such a poem you won’t like at all,

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.160
whether you understand the language or not.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.300
The whole tone of it will emit horrible vibrations;

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.380
it’s absolutely the essence of everything is nothing but vibrations.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.080
Everything is nothing but vibrations; the rest is all zero.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.360
We are nothing but our vibrations

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.840
which are

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.520
emitted because we are now connected with the Spirit.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.660
But otherwise also, whether you are connected with Spirit

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.520
or not, you emit vibrations.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.000
But these are the vibrations without the light in it,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.540
and you can feel the vibrations of a person out and out.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.160
You can feel, feel how.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.060
You can feel on your centres.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.600
All your centres become active and you start feeling on your centres.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.700
That means all these five centres, six, seven centres you start feeling.

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960
Even you may not feel in your fingers.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:07.500
Some of us Sahaja yogis may not feel also even today after so many days because their Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.760
They must have smoked in,  I think, ten lives,

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.480
and must have been horrible Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.160
and maybe that’s why it’s all on the myelin sheath of the nerves that you cannot feel it.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.360
That’s a different point.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.260
But you will feel it on your centres.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.700
And the feeling on the centre is emitted in your nervous system.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.980
And when it comes to it you feel it on your centres

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.120
and you know, you just know.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.880
And you know it as vibratory awareness.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.620
This vibratory awareness has to grow, no doubt.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.840
The sensitivity has to grow, no doubt.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.140
But, first you must touch it.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.320
If it has not even touched, then how can it grow?

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.720
But we are so conditioned that we take to things

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.680
which superficially are very appealing.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.240
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.140
It’s truth. It’s reality.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.900
Of course, you cannot pay for reality. I mean, how can you pay?

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.900
If it is reality, you cannot pay for it.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.780
That’s one simple thing.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.380
You cannot artificially say you are realised-soul.  You cannot.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.480
There was a girl, I met her in Portugal,

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.200
mischievous one, and she wanted to stick on with the Sahaja yogis

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.560
because she was very negative and she wanted to disturb the Sahaja yogis.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.140
And she came to the programme

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.540
and she told me, “Oh, I am feeling very well, Mother. I am feeling vibrations!”

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.080
I just looked at her.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.640
I kept quiet: because I knew she was not.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.100
I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to create trouble.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.980
But second day when she turned up I said, “Why are you telling me lies?”

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.220
“No, no, no!” I said, “Yes,

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.800
you are telling me lies. You have to be sincere.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.920
What are you going to gain?”

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.180
Say, you are mischievous.You are playing into the hands of negative forces:

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.820
what is your gain?

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.200
You are the Spirit. The Spirit is within you.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.980
You have to become the Spirit.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.740
It’s your own joy, is your own property, is your own Self:

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.800
which is not known to you.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200
Why not be honest about it

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.300
and get to it instead of playing tricks

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.820
with yourself?

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.280
And then playing tricks with other Sahaja yogis:

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.280
what is the use? What is the gain?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.780
Why are you playing into the hands of the satanic force?

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.080
Why don’t you play into the hands of the Divine force?”

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.500
She said, “No, no, Mother, I am feeling it!”

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.900
I said, “See, don’t tell me lies.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.100
I know for definite you are not feeling it,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.480
and if you are not going to be honest you are not going to come to my programme at all.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.980
You have to be honest yourself.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.920
If you are not honest I am not going to have you here.”

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.760
But dishonesty sometimes reaches a very absurd limit,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.040
because honesty is only up to which point you can see.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.720
Say, you can see the colour

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.360
is white – up to that you are honest.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
But if you start saying, “I know who has painted it,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.100
and I know who has done the job and I know who is the company,”

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.720
and all that, that’s not true.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.960
So honesty is up to the point you know.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.720
Beyond that, if you start saying things because you have read somewhere something

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.320
or you have heard something,

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.320
that’s wrong, that’s not being honest.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.040
So we have to have honesty and open-mindedness.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.360
You have to be open-minded and honest,

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.020
so that you see for yourself.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.040
Because as I told you it’s not like other places where you can just go and become members– nothing.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.680
First you have get your Realisation.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.080
Secondly, you have to grow into it.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.700
Those who cannot do, will be left out.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.360
You can’t help it.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.280
How far can you move it people?

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.480
How far can you tell them?

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.980
There’s no binding force.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.740
You are completely free to leave it or to take it.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.780
If you want to take it,

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.840
well and good. If you don’t want to take it,

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.780
no one is going to force you at all in this,! Because you cannot force.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.380
You can force a horse to eat,

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.720
that is possible;

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.000
but you cannot force any human being to be a realised-soul.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
You cannot.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.860
Not only that he has to ask for it

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.680
but he has to,later on, work for it.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.140
It is a tremendous thing you are asking for

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.840
and it’s the greatest thing that you are achieving.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.740
It is made easy, I should say.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:36.020
The times are such. It looks easy but it’s not so easy.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.240
In Sahaja Yoga there are more drop-outs than sticking people.

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.520
Naturally, because you have to be honest.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.480
You have to be very honest with it

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.640
and you have to give a try.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.960
Like in Spain I met about five, six ladies

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.860
and two men who came to see me.

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.940
When I came out I was very reluctant

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.860
to have anything to do with them.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.220
But, all the Sahaja yogis were so impressed.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.280
I don’t know why.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.000
“Oh, Mother they are so good. You don’t know,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.900
they came and looked at your photograph and they did this and all that.”

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.880
I said, “Now, it’s all right if you want I will try!

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.140
But somehow I don’t think much is going to work out.”

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.240
And they thought they had found such a great bunch of people,

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.800
who are real Sahaja yogis of the thing.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.000
I said, “Did you see their vibrations?”

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.940
They said, “No, Mother we were waiting for you.”

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.960
I said, “All right, doesn’t matter. I’ll have a look at them.”

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.460
And they said,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.200
first question they asked,“Mother, why is it Sahaja yogis don’t smoke?”

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.320
I said, “Because they don’t want to.”

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I mean, is that a question to ask?

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.420
I mean, if you smoke is it very normal?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.400
I just couldn’t understand this question.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800
She said, “No, we don’t want to lose our freedom

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.380
of smoking and freedom of drinking.”

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.500
I said, “Do you think you are free?

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.040
You are a slave.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.260
You can’t give up even if you want to.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.720
I can free you from that or your Kundalini can free you but you cannot.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.680
Even if you want you cannot give up,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:21.220
but here they just give up.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.380
I don’t tell them, I never force them,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.500
but it just happens because if you get the nectar of life you don’t care for other nonsensical things.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.980
It’s simple as that.”

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.660
But they were so frightened with the Sahaja yogis’ style of life,

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.660
means they don’t smoke and drink every night, they said, “This is impossible”.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.460
They gave up.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.380
Can you imagine? At the first talk we had!

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.980
But then we had people with such tremendous characters.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.620
They came for the program.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.820
I was so very happy, extremely happy and joyous.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.680
Everybody said, “Mother, why?”

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.080
They were little, sometimes,

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.640
not so much receptive, maybe, according to Sahaja yogis.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.760
But I could feel my vibrations sucked into them,

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.160
absolutely flowing: the energy just getting into them,

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.140
and suddenly they said, “Ah! Got it.”

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.920
And tremendous people!

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.960
Very well-educated also, some of them.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.840
But extremely well-versed about what we have to achieve.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.080
I was surprised

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.560
in Spain there are people who know Sanskrit so well and about everything,

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.080
about Chaitanya and all that.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.200
They know so well.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.880
It’s most surprising, and I used to think only scholarships exist in England.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.320
No. I was surprised.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.900
All of them knew about chakras.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.760
They knew about what it means. Everything they have sorted it out.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.740
I said,“When did you start?”

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.700
They said, “About, when we were, I think, ten years of age.”

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.160
I said, “Ten years of age? How?”

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.680
They said, “We, we just couldn’t be satisfied with what was the answer here.”

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360
“Such grown-up people,” I said.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.960
From ten years of age. So many of them!

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.960
And you should have seen the way they were!

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.960
And they recognise Sahaja Yoga and the tremendous effect it has and the work that it is doing.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.040
You will be amazed the way these people behaved towards Sahaj Yoga.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.820
Then I said, “Next time, I am not staying in London – Spain.”

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.380
Yeah, really, I tell you!

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.340
Just the kind of reception. There’s no barrier at all in their minds.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.360
It’s such pure intelligence, sharp, to see this is the thing

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.860
– where are we running.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.860
And really I felt that, eight years I have wasted in this country, that time.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.320
Really for a moment I just felt, “Oh, God!”

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.160
But you know the importance of this country is so great

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.160
because it’s the heart of the universe.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.880
I have to labour through it! And such lethargy and such inertia

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.820
and explanations.  Intellectuals have a very good,

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.980
an easy-chair way of looking at things, very easy-chair way of looking at things.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.760
Easy-chair politicians they are.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.620
“Well, it’s very interesting.”

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.920
Many a times I have heard [this], “It’s very interesting, you know, Mother, what you have given us.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.120
Very nice, yes, yes.”

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:23.220
It’s very common! But there, for them, it was a heavenly gift because they knew what it was.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.820
What’s the use of all the scholarship of Lord Byron

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.320
when you can’t recognise Christ?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.660
When you can’t recognise the truth?

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.600
What’s this education for?

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:41.500
I was amazed at these people. They never went to Cambridge and they were not Oxbridges.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.020
Most surprising!

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.780
And they were people of great intelligence, very well-versed.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.080
And in Spain!

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.340
Can you imagine?

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.460
The same I will say of Italy.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.540
Italians are supposed to be very dishonest and this,  that, I have heard.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.620
Nobody was dishonest with me

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:08.840
as far as I am concerned: very upright, straightforward and tremendous people.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.560
Just my photograph convinced them.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.960
They said, “The face shows!” They hate the Pope.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:24.500
They hate the Papal things. They know all about Pope. Everything they know.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.840
They have sorted out everything. But to know so much about chakras and things,

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.220
I was amazed.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.760
They knew about tantrism. They knew that Hitler used tantrikas.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.180
They knew that Hitler used all these things. Actually, they told me. So I was amazed how did they know?

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:44.180
I dared not say this before because everyone who is following all these tantrikas would have been angry with me.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.200
But that’s what Hitler did.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.740
And so much they knew!

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:54.180
One of the boys was just, you can call him a hippie or whatever he may be.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.920
He went on the street shouting, “Oh, Mother has come now!

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.280
The Mother has come! The Holy Mother has come! What are you doing now?

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.620
Come along to the programme!” He was shouting on the street like “Eureka!”

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.120
And a learned man, in the real sense of the word.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.380
It’s such a pleasure to talk to them, such a pleasure, I tell you.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.900
I think it is time that English should come down a little,

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.460
really.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.100
Australia again: just look at Australians,

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.800
they are supposed to be convicts.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.260
Supposed to be; I can’t understand.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.220
You see, this high-handedness, or we can call it

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.200
condescendingly to watch something

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.220
is not proper, it’s not proper.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.960
You must come down in humility, otherwise things will not work out,

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.960
I can tell you. You have to humble down.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.340
We have Hampstead: so what?

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.980
What have you done to Blake?

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.780
Can you understand him?

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.240
Do you know who he was?

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.320
Do you know what he wanted to say?

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.540
What he wanted to communicate?

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.620
Even in his programme, where I went,

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:18.040
to see his beautiful paintings, people were watching how many nude women and nude men he has produced.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:25.940
With all this, and this [low] level, I just couldn’t understand it.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.660
You must understand holiness.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.600
You must understand auspiciousness. You must understand sublime things.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.220
Something great that is beyond

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.820
just now, but is within your reach because you are sublime.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200
You are not a low-level animal.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.480
You are sublime.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.020
You are the Spirit.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.660
Unless and until you really assume that situation

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.560
with that pride and glory,

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.400
to God you are nothing.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.580
You are just zero, useless.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.280
And this is what I’ll find always, new people coming,

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.900
even in your Hampstead, Magda, and they just disappear.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.700
It’s like one lecture, it’s free. “All right, let’s go and see Mother.”That’s all.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.380
All these experiences, even in a country like Portugal,

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.740
Portugal.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.880
The way people have done, Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.180
I go there for three days only.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.800
Only for three days in a year. I must have gone there only twice so far.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.620
Look at them:

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:43.440
young people taking up responsibility, working it out for their country.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.440
So much they understand of auspiciousness.

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.120
How have we lost all that sense of holiness and auspiciousness?

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.900
We are running after people who are collecting money from you,

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.440
giving you a circus.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.560
How can you?

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:04.200
How can you not find out that this is not the truth, that you have to be the truth,

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.560
that you are something great?

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.120
Why can’t we assume that situation?

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.300
We are not our ego.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:11.880
No, we are not.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.780
We are the Spirit,the sublime, the great.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.760
And that’s what I find.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:21.540
Many new people coming, then they disappear, then they come after ten days,

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.540
then after they come after one month.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.040
They have this problem, that problem.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.820
Then why not grow?

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.740
When are we going to grow?

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:38.080
When are we going to become fully that?

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.300
Time is very short, my children.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.420
Time is very, very short. Believe me.

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.340
Some people advise me, “Mother, you have to be very strict and all that.”

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.980
I don’t know how a Mother could be strict.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:54.620
What should I do? Because, you cannot force it on anyone.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.980
The problem [I have / I’m helpless], is I cannot force it on to you

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.520
This is a big problem. You must understand this. You are seekers.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:11.120
You are seekers of very great times, born in this great country of yours, but so much conditioned.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.400
This is for you to take it within yourself, what you are, and to achieve that.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.120
This is something cannot be forced.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:28.980
I cannot mischievously do something or cleverly do something or cunningly say something to convince you.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.640
It is not that. It is something that has to happen within you,

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.080
that you have to be something more than what you are.

00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.360
It’s that concern of Mine

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:43.360
because it’s my job

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.680
that keeps me here.

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:54.960
You must know your real Self which is seeking,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.880
which is seeking the truth.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.160
It will never be satisfied with all these monkey tricks that people are indulging into.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.500
It’s no monkey tricks.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.720
You don’t become a monkey,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.460
like dancing, jumping, singing.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.920
This is not the thing.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.820
In your awareness, in your central nervous system

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.260
you should feel the presence of your Spirit.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.700
That’s it.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.060
If you have discarded Christianity ?

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.400
like, some people write to me,

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.380
“Mother, I have many problems. First begins with Christianity” ?

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.680
where do you land?

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.420
Even if you discard Christianity you can’t do without Christ.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.680
Christ is there. I mean, Christ is our soul. We cannot do without Him.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.660
Then you come into another thing,

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.000
then you fall into another trap, then fall into another trap.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.800
You miss the essence of it every time you fall into these peripheries.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.380
The essence is in the centre of it and that centre is within you; is your Spirit.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.400
You may ask me a hundred questions, I will give you two hundred answers;

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.580
makes no difference at all, I tell you.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.420
It is of no value,

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.060
of no availability

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.660
to you or any goodness out of it you, believe me.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.580
You have to be what you are.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.260
Unless and until that happens and you establish it within yourself,

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.980
it’s such a waste of life, waste of this Creation,

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.040
everything I feel wasted.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.740
So I have to request you again and again.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.940
Of course, in London now there are some very great Sahaja yogis, no doubt,

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.540
we have,

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.000
but the way it has been progressing if I were in any other country, I tell you,

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:48.180
things would have been very different.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.000
I can assure you this one, any other country.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.820
America? I’ve been there only once.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:55.880
Can you believe it?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Long time back, that too for about

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.560
four, five days, and this time when I went

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:03.180
I was hardly in any place for more than three days.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.380
Say, Houston, hardly for three days and how many people there are.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.020
I mean, you don’t know. Ask Gavin, he’ll tell you.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.380
What’s wrong with us? Let’s see.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.720
I just can’t understand

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.940
why we can’t grow.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:29.020
Why can’t we give up our conditionings easily and take to truth and get into it?

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:36.640
We don’t understand is it the importance of this time,

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.580
the vital nature of this happening.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:48.860
Or have we lost that sense of seriousness

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.080
where an emergency of this kind has arisen today which we don’t feel or fathom?

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.400
Or we just think that it’s just a joke going on?

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.940
Or our life we treat is just like

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.140
a joke or a frivolous thing?

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.220
What is it?

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.500
I still can’t understand what stops that truth…

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:15.880
beyond me.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.520
The land is fertile, beautiful.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.760
I am not sown my seeds in a wrong land;

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.300
I know that.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.620
But doesn’t grow; it doesn’t grow.

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.940
It doesn’t take shape.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.440
What’s the matter?

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.600
Today there are new people, I am happy to know,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
and I have to make a humble request to all of you.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.120
If you have to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:52.900
you have to be people who have to understand that reality is not a joke.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.400
It’s not a frivolous thing.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.280
You have to become

00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.520
a realised-soul

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:06.140
and you have to grow in the light of that Realisation and you have to master this art.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.280
We need now masters all over.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.600
Not that somebody else is your master but you become your own master.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.920
Such people are needed to channelise the energy of God.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.540
I am sure

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.660
Warren must have told you all about it.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.180
He’s another great character I have;

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.620
very proud of him,

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.980
the way he feels responsible for the whole world,

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.260
the way he came down.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.000
He sacrificed so much, so much.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.780
I mean we, I don’t need any money from an, anything as such,

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:50.660
but even money-wise I am sure he must have done something.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.380
I don’t know because I have never taken any money from him as such.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.620
But even there I am sure,

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:01.620
he established an ashram, he established people, he got them, he worked it out.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.940
I mean it’s remarkable, and how people followed him, seeing him the way he is.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:12.360
He doesn’t have any private life left except for to enjoy this privacy of the Spirit with others,

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:17.700
and if you see his background

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:21.800
he’ll tell you that he knew he was a seeker

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.280
but in the seeking he committed so many mistakes, so many mistakes.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.240
But look at his sensitivity.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:30.980
He knows where the Kundalini is,

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:36.100
he knows how to correct it and not him but most of the people from Australia know it so well.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.400
It’s nothing mundane.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.340
It will be very sad

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.060
and unhappy if you people get your Realisation

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.900
and lose it and do not develop into it.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.220
I don’t know what would be the category of such people

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:01.440
whom God has given the light and they didn’t give light to anyone.

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:05.200
I don’t know what should be the position.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.820
Today I am rather concerned,

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:13.740
very much concerned because I have come back from these three countries.

00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:17.620
I was amazed.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.120
France: tremendous.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.520
French people,

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.220
I used to always say that these “les miserables” and all that.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.980
Nothing of the kind.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:34.820
There’s a priest who got his Realisation.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.500
He formed an association called “Saving the people from gurus.”

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.140
Very clever,

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.420
and he is a priest still,

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.160
but he is a Sahaja yogi out and out.

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:55.620
And what he does,  those people who go to him and tell against the Christianity

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:57.620
he said,“Why don’t you go to Sahaja Yoga?”

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.700
Anybody whom he saves, he sends them to Sahaja Yoga…

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.200
all that.

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.560
But the other day he said, “Mother, why should we have Pope anymore?”

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.500
Look at that.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.280
And he stays in the church and works for Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.760
Can you beat that?

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:19.100
Because he thinks he has to save people who are misled.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.380
He does that.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.380
We have people of that calibre.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.700
Another one we met,

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.080
another one very great one,

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.740
in Portugal.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:37.700
He told me that the T.M. gentleman wanted to establish his kingdom in Portugal.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:40.000
He’s got a very big land and all that.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.860
And he told me all the secrets.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.400
He said, “I am going to talk to the people who are in charge here.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.340
They are sensible.”

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:48.280
I said, “Really? Are you sure?”

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.940
I said, “If you want to talk to anybody here in Mentmore, they’ll not listen.. They are very satisfied

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.040
with the yards of black suits they are wearing

00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:02.860
and with the so-called idea of sitting on a gold gilded chair.

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:08.520
All that stupidity.” He said, “No, not in Portugal. They are very sensible people.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.760
They realise it. I am going to talk to them.”

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:14.700
Because they are all suffering

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.320
so early. Only three years they have been doing it.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:21.560
They are all suffering on the left side, their ears are finished, somebody’s eyes are finished,

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:26.120
somebody’s problem is on the left side, somebody has a problem on the left Void and all that.

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.180
I cured, of course.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.460
But they said, “All of us are suffering.”

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.260
That means they are very sensitive also to suffer so fast.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.400
And they are realising, they are reaching all of them, even their administrators and their;

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:44.440
everybody’s realising that there’s some sort of a nonsense going on in this T.M.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.240
Just imagine.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.040
When I went back,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
so transformed and changed.

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.140
The one gentleman had an eye like this.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.700
It’s all opened out equally the same, everything,face so transformed.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.840
I said, “I can’t recognise you, the way you are changed.”

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.280
Such a short time, in eight days,

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:10.880
they worked it out.

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.640
Portugal is a country known for its escape nowadays.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:24.720
There are nobody, we should call,the real Portuguese

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.020
have run away from that country.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.600
They are settled in Brazil.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:33.780
Spain, people have not much hopes from Spain, politically.It’s a hopeless country, they say.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.940
Italy is the worst of all. They have Mafia, this.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.220
And in that Maya

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.640
these beautiful lotuses to see.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.480
What a joy it was;

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.940
what a joy.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.100
You can’t imagine.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.140
Even our Ambassador in Spain said, “The people here are very different, Mother.”

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.820
He said, “I talked to some people. They said, ‘When She is coming you have to call us.’”

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:05.740
I said, “Next year you have a big program. This year let’s have only the Indians.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.900
But next year, of course, you can call.”

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.280
You see, all of them here want to have Realisation.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.940
All big people, eminent people.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.320
You just come next year and you’ll see all of them.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:19.960
Here, do you think anybody?

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:26.360
An ambassador, can you imagine?

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.100
I can’t think.

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.300
Very funny people.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.660
I’ve met a very big man once in a dinner party

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:44.580
where one of the Sahaja yogis is the chairman of the Hague High Court, of course an Indian, Dr. Nagen Singh.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:48.520
And he told that gentleman that,

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.140
“This lady is a very well-known spiritual leader of India and She has given Realisation to many

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.920
and She has given Realisation to me also.”

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.780
He looked at me and he said, “No, I am also a realised-soul.”

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.060
What to say?

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.020
He said, “Christ has given me Realisation.

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.140
It’s Christ who is going to give me.”

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:17.980
So Nagen Singh in Hindi says,“There are no vibrations,the Kundalini is frozen

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.840
and this one is saying. How can Christ give him Realisation?”

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.880
I said, “This is the escape because Christ is no more.”

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.000
Of course, Christ gives him but where is Christ within himself?

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.700
So he asked him, “Where is Christ within yourself?”

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.580
“That Christ knows himself.”

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.860
He said, “I didn’t know these people were such buffoons.”

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Really, these were his words.

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:48.700
And my husband then couldn’t bear it any more

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.760
He said “Now, forget it.” You see, he was such a blind man.

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.680
I mean, in India people may not get Realisation,

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.480
may not, but they know what is Realisation.

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.820
They know who is truthful,

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.880
I must say.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.180
Whether they are ambassadors or Presidents, make no difference;

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.740
they know that definitely.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.260
Even President of India, say,

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.700
if he sees me he doesn’t sit down.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.420
He’ll stand up.

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.400
They have that sense.

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.580
That basic humility is missing.

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.840
That’s why we take to people who pamper our ego.

00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.840
We take to people who are nonsensical.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.540
We take to people who befool us.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.400
Only the egoistical can be befooled.

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:43.340
If you are not egoistical no one can befool you

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.420
How do you befool a person?

00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.880
By pampering the ego.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.140
So one has to understand

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:55.420
that unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.640
we are not going to do very well in England.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.980
It’s for all the Sahaja yogis as well as for people who have come here.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:07.660
It’s a very, very, serious problem,

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:17.380
and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe that is this England, that’s the Heart.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:23.180
And if you now any way escape your responsibility,

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.920
you will be held responsible,

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:30.420
I am telling you now very strongly.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.500
Because today I had big lectures from people saying that,

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:37.540
“Mother, you don’t say things strongly, and people are to be frightened.”

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.400
I don’t want to frighten you but you will be held responsible,

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.340
take it from me.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.100
You are born on this Earth,

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.660
on this

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:46.900
great land

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.240
for a very great purpose,

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.720
to create Jerusalem out of that.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.720
And now if you are not going to stand up,

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.200
you’ll be held responsible.

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.260
This is what it is.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.300
It’s a tremendous work one has to do,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.900
for which you must prepare yourself

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.340
Get to it.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.300
I can give Realisation;  that’s all.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.540
But I can’t give you strength.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.540
I mean, you can’t make the horse stand up on his forelegs, can you?

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.380
It’s a very, very, desperate situation sometimes the way things happen.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:31.100
After all, you must know that My coming here has some meaning of.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.700
I didn’t come here because

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.140
I chose to come in the way people,

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.380
the gurus walk into your country.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.700
I came here because something was done spontaneously.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:48.240
I had to stay here, I had to work for you,

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.100
I had to implore you and request you and tell you in every way possible your responsibility.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.800
But then you don’t tell me because I have not failed in my duties as far as I’m concerned.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.280
Of that I am very sure.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.660
But now I’ll leave it to you

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.940
because I may not be here next year. What can you say?

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.860
Depends on the moods.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:14.980
But we have to see what you are going to do for the whole world,

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.280
for the whole emancipation of the human being.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400
First you have to find your own beauty

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.180
and you have to give this beauty to others.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.660
This is a greatest artist’s job you have to do,

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.380
as a great master of art in divine life.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.940
You have to become divine.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.120
It’s you who has to become divine.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.600
You don’t worry about me.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:42.340
I don’t have to achieve anything.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.800
That’s the only problem.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.140
I don’t have to achieve it.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400
I have to only achieve you people.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:02:01.260
I have to only have ways and methods by which I could really make you grow.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:11.300
All that is possible I will do, but you must stand up on your legs, must ask for it.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.340
It’s a big problem.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.320
Not for others; for me.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.840
Because others have no such problem.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.720
They don’t want you to stand on your legs.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.820
They want you to crawl and they want you to disappear.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.420
This is a different thing. I want you to grow,

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.720
not because I want, but Divine wants it.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.600
The whole Creation wants it.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.160
Otherwise it will have no meaning.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:42.000
So the responsibility of English Sahaja yogis,

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.000
British Sahaja yogis is very great.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.900
Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible,

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.980
that establish yourself.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.300
You are lagging behind.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.500
I can tell you Spanish people will have to come and teach you Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.320
Already we have got somebody from Australia to teach that.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.540
You give up your old ideas and conditioning.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:13.240
Every Saturday, Sunday, must you go out of the country, out of London?

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.860
London is your place where you have to work.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.060
Unless and until you take it up upon yourself it’s not going to work out.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.060
Some people have to do it, someone.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:37.360
I am looking out for such people for whom this is their desire.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:42.480
We talk of big things. If we talk to anyone, I see in big, big parties they talk,

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:45.500
“Oh, what’s this?” and “We must become peaceful countries.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.360
We must do this and that must happen.”

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:54.280
And even if you’ll listen to the lecture of our great President of America,

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.940
you find, “Oh God, some angel is speaking,” or what?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.760
Like an angel, they speak.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:05.840
Angelic, prophetic, such big, big, words. I can’t understand even

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:12.880
it won’t come into the mouth of God Himself but the way people talk, ultimately what remains is nothing.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.100
So let us be that, what we talk.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.640
We can be.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.860
We all can be. It’s very simple.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:27.820
You have to decide.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.560
You have to really decide. The time has come.

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.720
I just pray may God give you strength to stand with the truth.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.940
It’s not difficult.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.900
It’s very joy-giving. But stand with it, grow with it.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:48.620
That’s what you are. Thank you very much.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:59.060
Now if you have any questions you can ask me and we should have Realisation.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:04:59.880
Hello.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.600
What’s that? What’s that here?

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:19.760
Right Swadisthana. She’s showing right Swadisthana.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:28.460
Oh, all right. Now you take this one.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:57.380
They are fighting. They are fighting, see, working it out.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.820
They are all fighting.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.340
How is your child,[Graham]?

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.060
That same thing?

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.600
Much less.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:22.280
Your Agnya? Have you brought her?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:28.260
No, because I haven’t the right, because she has [just come out of / to stay in the] hospital two or three weeks.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.620
“All right. On my way back if we have time I will go for see her.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.260
That child is fighting.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.060
What sufferings from the very beginning of life.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.020
That house also I think has problems.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:59.660
No questions? Are there any questions please?

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.640
Yes?

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:18.860
I’m from Holland and I wonder whether I should try to stay in England, in London for, should I remain in England to find work? ”

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.640
It’s difficult to find?

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:29.660
I am wondering whether I should try to find work here in England or, do you understand what I am saying?

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.800
You are English?

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.780
No, Holland.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.400
Yes?

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:33.180
Holland.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:33.940
Holland?

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:37.260
Yes.Oh, we need people in Holland.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.620
I haven’t yet touched it.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.720
Excuse me?

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800
I haven’t yet touched Holland.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.360
Haven’t been there. I went there once, a long time back, but we have to touch Holland

01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:53.240
There are lots of seekers, no doubt, but

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.780
drinking too much.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:06.080
Yeah. They drink too much, they told me, like Scotland, see,

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.880
chana. All right, you eat chana

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.860
and we have to look after them, no doubt.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.620
There are lots of seekers misled there are.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.180
In Holland we have one great soul.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:23.640
There’s a young boy of sixteen years, I think. Careen, his name is.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.520
They asked him about his father, mother, everything.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.360
He said, “my father is just like other fathers.”

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.380
I said, “Really? What does he do?”

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:37.000
“In the daytime he drinks beer. In the night he drinks whisky.”

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.500
I said, “Really?” “All fathers do that, Mother.”

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:44.240
“And what about the children?”

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.340
“Some of us, our friends, we meditate but most of them also are drinking beer.”

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.300
When he was twelve years he first came.

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:56.220
I think twelve or eight years he came here, I think.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.300
Yes, and he must be sixteen now, yes.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.960
Wonderful man. He is growing up there.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:05.040
I told him to gather more people who think like him.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.700
He might, he is a great person.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:13.620
His mother is French and father is this thing and divorced and another mother,

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.880
all kinds of problems.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:19.860
No, would be better in Holland, no doubt, but you get your Realisation,

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:24.460
you settle down here and we must start a centre in Holland and next year I am coming down there,

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:25.760
all right?

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.840
Holland is one place I have not been. I didn’t go to Austria.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.660
Now, we have a very powerful yogi there. So I am going this year.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.160
A few countries I have not tackled.

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.300
We should not go away from our country.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.720
We should work there.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.260
That’s the place we have to work, whatever is the condition.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.820
Switzerland now are doing very well. Switzerland is doing so well.

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.900
Those who were committing suicide are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and doing very well.

01:09:51.900 --> 01:09:56.820
I said, “The way you [are/were] doing suicide, if you can do Sahaja Yoga even once it will be all right.”

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:02.060
Because they did a perfect job always with their suicide things.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.880
They used to plan it out so well, the suicide,

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.920
in such a way, I mean, that it would not create any problems for anyone and sort of thing.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:19.160
They used to think about it all the time, how to commit suicide, and they, very great planning.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:22.540
But look at Switzerland.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.160
It’s a challenge to all of you.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.860
So it’s a good idea.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:41.500
You get your Sahaja Yoga here, settle down, master it and go to Holland.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:47.260
You would be the one of the—- I gave once a Realisation to one Mr. called August Tigger.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.960
He was the chairman of your, one of your very big companies.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.020
He was a very big man, no doubt, but he told me that,

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.440
“I cannot talk about to anyone. They will think I have gone crazy.”

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:06.820
And he died.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.940
He was a very old man when I met him.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.180
He was about eighty years of age when I first met him.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.860
And a very great seeker he was, very great seeker.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:27.940
Holland I’ll definitely come, no doubt.

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.940
And now we have reached Brussels also.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.840
So in Brussels and Holland we can do it, isn’t it?

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.860
From Brussels it is easier to go to Amsterdam.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:40.620
Where will you be in Holland?

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.620
I have no place at all.

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:43.220
Huh.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.220
have no place [where] to go for the moment.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.100
But you will be placed in Holland?

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.260
Then I have to go back. I have to.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.880
Yes, you should, you should.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.640
You see, I would request you, once you become a Sahaja yogi, you should go there,

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.800
and we’ll send some people to help you also.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.280
There is somebody very powerful in Brussels,

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.780
Very powerful in Brussels, who’ll help you, very powerful.

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.300
You remember that Rajneesh fellow who came?

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.760
Oh, he’s so powerful.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.900
You must see that.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.600
He’s brought about ten people from Brussels to Lille.

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:24.140
Can you imagine?

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.980
He’s already started his own centre.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.040
It can only work in the democratic countries, isn’t it?

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.540
And I think Holland is very important.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.460
And who is there is Dr Nagen Singh himself, is there in Holland.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.700
He’s in Hague.

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.800
Is he?

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:49.340
He’s in Hague.He’s the Chairman of your World Court.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:40.360
Look, what? What? Anand? Anand. This is Anand. Ananad. And this is?

01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:45.980
Sonu. Sonu. Sonu. Say Sonu.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.700
He’s a real joker, I tell you.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.220
What makes you laugh so much and look here?

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.980
All right now. Sit down, you sit down there.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.820
Sit down. All right. Be a nice girl, all right?

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.100
Ha, now sit down. Yes, we have to raise their Kundalini.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:24.160
Ha, come along, come along, come along, come along, come along now.) How is she [unclear name]?

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.160
All right now

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.280
Better?

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:38.560
She is better. How is the baby from Australia? Is he all right? Is he all right?

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.860
Much better.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.540
Much better now. I am sorry that day you had gone away.I wanted to see the baby.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:00.800
What? Ha. Ha. Hop. Hop.

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:09.040
Ha, up, up. Hop. Hop.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:16.180
Now, hop, hop. Come, come. Anna, come, come.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.180
These children.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.120
Give her, give her chana. Good.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.660
Give her some, give her, give some chana. Give her some chana.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.140
All right. Go and give her some chana. All right? Take this one

01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:02.760
You give her. I told you to give her.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.040
All right, let’s have it, for that.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:17.300
See how cheerful they are, how cheerful. All right, now we are going to keep quiet.Sit down here, sit down.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.360
All of us are going to sit down.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.220
All right? Sit down. Come here. Come here. Sit down.

01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:24.580
All sit down. You sit down. Olympia.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:30.440
You sit down. All right? Sit down. All right. Be a nice girl. Now, it’s all right.Let her be.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:37.140
She is not well. She is still little. All right, she’ll come.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.600
She’s, she will come.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:46.400
She can’t leave. She can’t enjoy herself, see. That’s what it is; everybody must enjoy.

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:53.540
All right. Now close your eyes, please. Just close your eyes.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.880
Put both your feet on the ground.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.380
Now, take out your shoes. Shoes, shoes.
