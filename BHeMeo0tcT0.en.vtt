00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:09.156
All these years

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:19.075
I have been waiting for this day.

00:03:24.817 --> 00:03:32.356
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:43.989
so is a very important turning point

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:57.908
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.398
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:11.519
And so now is a new change has to come

00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:16.857
and you can see the announcement.

00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:35.225
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

00:04:36.703 --> 00:04:44.640
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

00:04:46.444 --> 00:04:49.789
We are collectively conscious.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:01.610
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:10.144
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:18.914
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:29.952
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:36.316
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:43.085
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

00:05:55.549 --> 00:06:01.842
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:05.850
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

00:06:06.127 --> 00:06:12.323
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:26.204
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.834
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

00:06:33.035 --> 00:06:36.840
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:42.969
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.361
All the time they are helping you.

00:06:45.562 --> 00:06:49.430
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:53.721
they are using them at the right time.

00:06:53.922 --> 00:07:02.524
Now be confident that you have powers.

00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:14.536
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:19.464
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:25.359
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:34.879
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:42.576
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

00:07:42.777 --> 00:07:47.175
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

00:07:47.376 --> 00:07:52.069
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.742
and the new character is announcement.

00:07:55.956 --> 00:08:03.242
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

00:08:03.562 --> 00:08:09.209
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:12.728
Now you have to all start talking about it,

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:16.493
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

00:08:16.694 --> 00:08:22.612
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

00:08:23.216 --> 00:08:30.316
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

00:08:30.507 --> 00:08:34.342
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

00:08:34.543 --> 00:08:39.548
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:44.844
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

00:08:45.035 --> 00:08:48.800
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

00:08:49.021 --> 00:08:52.930
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:59.642
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:06.058
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:12.919
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:18.413
and very different type of people.

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:25.682
Now that assumption has to be there.

00:09:26.176 --> 00:09:33.331
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

00:09:33.512 --> 00:09:38.966
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:45.180
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:48.772
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

00:09:48.972 --> 00:09:56.103
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

00:09:56.305 --> 00:10:00.577
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

00:10:00.778 --> 00:10:07.340
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:12.607
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:27.128
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

00:10:27.329 --> 00:10:29.423
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

00:10:29.624 --> 00:10:32.521
now leave them in the water.”

00:10:32.722 --> 00:10:33.917
His attention was here and there,

00:10:34.118 --> 00:10:38.100
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:41.730
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:46.321
and lasted for five days more after that.

00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:49.852
Then he was convinced.

00:10:51.793 --> 00:10:59.550
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

00:10:59.751 --> 00:11:03.944
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

00:11:04.145 --> 00:11:07.798
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:13.097
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:17.554
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:23.530
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:28.709
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:36.316
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.264
for your countries and for the whole world.

00:11:41.772 --> 00:11:44.891
Now, assume your powers.

00:11:45.092 --> 00:11:50.998
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

00:11:51.228 --> 00:11:55.880
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

00:11:56.081 --> 00:12:02.478
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

00:12:02.702 --> 00:12:07.839
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.250
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

00:12:12.451 --> 00:12:15.414
Now you have to count your powers:

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:21.046
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

00:12:21.277 --> 00:12:24.945
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

00:12:25.136 --> 00:12:30.333
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

00:12:30.534 --> 00:12:33.236
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

00:12:33.436 --> 00:12:37.281
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

00:12:37.482 --> 00:12:41.001
and how you are going to work out.

00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:48.786
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

00:12:48.987 --> 00:12:54.380
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:58.668
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

00:12:58.869 --> 00:13:03.900
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:07.131
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

00:13:07.332 --> 00:13:11.302
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

00:13:11.503 --> 00:13:14.948
that I have put many a times before
you people,

00:13:15.149 --> 00:13:17.995
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:20.791
Now don’t have diffidence.

00:13:20.992 --> 00:13:25.666
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:30.076
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:32.625
This work is not going to be done
by special people

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:36.576
because they are suffering from ego.

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:40.341
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:47.255
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

00:13:47.456 --> 00:13:51.577
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:56.183
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

00:13:56.384 --> 00:14:07.742
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

00:14:07.943 --> 00:14:11.510
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:15.288
any animal you could think of.

00:14:15.489 --> 00:14:20.162
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

00:14:20.363 --> 00:14:27.305
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:34.249
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.541
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:42.494
So many letters of confessions come to me,

00:14:42.695 --> 00:14:46.608
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:50.112
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

00:14:50.313 --> 00:14:54.363
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

00:14:54.564 --> 00:14:57.725
I am a Maha Yogi.”

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.672
This is the confession you have to make.

00:15:01.873 --> 00:15:05.929
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.888
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:13.472
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

00:15:13.673 --> 00:15:18.611
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

00:15:18.812 --> 00:15:24.087
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

00:15:24.288 --> 00:15:31.291
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:41.233
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

00:15:41.434 --> 00:15:44.520
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

00:15:44.721 --> 00:15:46.746
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:50.532
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:52.809
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.627
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

00:15:56.828 --> 00:15:59.693
running after something that is a mirage

00:15:59.894 --> 00:16:04.015
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

00:16:04.216 --> 00:16:06.924
We have to openly say it, this thing.

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:08.809
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.599
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.585
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

00:16:14.786 --> 00:16:20.582
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:26.161
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

00:16:26.362 --> 00:16:29.074
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:32.319
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.266
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:47.275
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

00:16:47.476 --> 00:16:50.584
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:55.286
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

00:16:55.487 --> 00:16:59.798
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:05.634
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

00:17:05.835 --> 00:17:10.791
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

00:17:10.992 --> 00:17:16.982
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:20.074
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

00:17:20.275 --> 00:17:26.048
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:26.249 --> 00:17:29.034
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:33.777
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

00:17:33.978 --> 00:17:38.734
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

00:17:38.935 --> 00:17:42.290
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:45.265
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:49.646
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

00:17:49.847 --> 00:17:55.356
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

00:17:55.557 --> 00:18:01.625
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

00:18:01.826 --> 00:18:07.463
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

00:18:07.664 --> 00:18:12.219
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:18.375
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

00:18:18.576 --> 00:18:22.844
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

00:18:23.045 --> 00:18:28.146
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

00:18:28.347 --> 00:18:32.646
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

00:18:32.847 --> 00:18:36.066
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:38.285
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

00:18:38.486 --> 00:18:40.939
for every small little nonsensical things.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.157
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

00:18:43.358 --> 00:18:45.380
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

00:18:45.581 --> 00:18:48.929
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.500
they are not going to come out.”

00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:56.077
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

00:18:56.278 --> 00:18:59.353
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

00:18:59.554 --> 00:19:02.439
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.722
You are not entangled with anyone.

00:19:04.923 --> 00:19:07.733
You are not any way attached to anyone.

00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:11.680
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:15.104
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

00:19:15.305 --> 00:19:18.078
your country and ultimately the world.

00:19:18.309 --> 00:19:26.426
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

00:19:26.627 --> 00:19:29.771
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

00:19:29.972 --> 00:19:33.106
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

00:19:33.349 --> 00:19:36.026
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

00:19:36.227 --> 00:19:41.655
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

00:19:41.856 --> 00:19:47.178
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

00:19:47.379 --> 00:19:49.674
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:52.845
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

00:19:53.046 --> 00:19:55.347
But there is all knowledge within you.

00:19:55.548 --> 00:19:59.810
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:02.943
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

00:20:03.129 --> 00:20:06.894
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

00:20:07.095 --> 00:20:11.265
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

00:20:11.466 --> 00:20:15.739
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

00:20:15.953 --> 00:20:20.804
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

00:20:21.005 --> 00:20:25.058
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

00:20:25.239 --> 00:20:28.619
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.076
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

00:20:31.277 --> 00:20:35.078
But these are very, very mundane things

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:38.529
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.236
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

00:20:43.437 --> 00:20:45.702
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

00:20:45.903 --> 00:20:48.258
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:51.730
whether you are a child or a grown up.

00:20:51.931 --> 00:20:55.945
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

00:20:56.146 --> 00:21:00.858
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:03.937
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:06.853
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

00:21:07.054 --> 00:21:10.512
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

00:21:10.713 --> 00:21:15.440
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:18.781
is a commitment and complete involvement.

00:21:18.982 --> 00:21:22.460
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:25.342
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

00:21:25.543 --> 00:21:28.848
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

00:21:29.049 --> 00:21:32.818
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

00:21:33.019 --> 00:21:35.927
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:38.421
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:38.622 --> 00:21:42.721
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:46.080
The whole attention should be on that.

00:21:46.281 --> 00:21:50.905
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

00:21:51.106 --> 00:21:55.909
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.753
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

00:21:59.954 --> 00:22:04.824
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

00:22:05.025 --> 00:22:08.130
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

00:22:08.331 --> 00:22:11.990
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:17.599
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.595
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

00:22:20.796 --> 00:22:25.529
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.179
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.376
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

00:22:31.577 --> 00:22:36.082
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

00:22:36.283 --> 00:22:39.567
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

00:22:39.768 --> 00:22:44.382
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

00:22:46.077 --> 00:22:53.376
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

00:22:53.577 --> 00:22:57.524
because attention which was involved
into negative things

00:22:57.725 --> 00:23:03.021
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:03.222 --> 00:23:07.446
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

00:23:07.647 --> 00:23:10.617
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

00:23:10.818 --> 00:23:13.197
then we should think that you are still
backdated

00:23:13.398 --> 00:23:20.335
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:24.908
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:31.931
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

00:23:32.132 --> 00:23:36.877
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

00:23:37.078 --> 00:23:42.213
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

00:23:42.414 --> 00:23:49.944
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

00:23:50.145 --> 00:23:52.711
You just experiment and see for yourself.

00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:55.563
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

00:23:55.764 --> 00:23:58.622
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

00:23:58.823 --> 00:24:02.229
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:07.424
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:09.709
Now those days are gone!

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.708
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:20.407
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

00:24:20.608 --> 00:24:31.933
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

00:24:32.134 --> 00:24:34.944
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:38.257
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

00:24:38.458 --> 00:24:40.801
You can eat the way you want to eat.

00:24:41.002 --> 00:24:46.029
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:55.100
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

00:24:55.301 --> 00:24:58.960
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

00:24:59.161 --> 00:25:03.897
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

00:25:04.098 --> 00:25:07.375
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

00:25:07.576 --> 00:25:12.071
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:18.513
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

00:25:18.714 --> 00:25:22.143
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

00:25:22.344 --> 00:25:26.291
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:30.772
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

00:25:30.973 --> 00:25:33.223
and we have to work it out that way.

00:25:33.424 --> 00:25:36.207
Today we have here people from all over
the world

00:25:36.408 --> 00:25:39.528
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

00:25:39.729 --> 00:25:43.666
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

00:25:43.867 --> 00:25:48.947
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

00:25:49.148 --> 00:25:56.649
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

00:25:56.879 --> 00:26:00.889
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.068
May God bless you all.

00:26:16.707 --> 00:26:19.426
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

00:26:19.627 --> 00:26:22.072
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

00:26:22.273 --> 00:26:24.690
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:28.196
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

00:26:28.397 --> 00:26:33.487
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

00:26:33.688 --> 00:26:37.866
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:42.327
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

00:26:42.528 --> 00:26:48.111
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

00:26:48.311 --> 00:26:53.511
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

00:26:53.712 --> 00:27:01.039
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

00:27:02.069 --> 00:27:07.556
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

00:27:07.764 --> 00:27:14.045
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.866
But only thing what you need is a courage

00:27:19.067 --> 00:27:24.988
and a complete commitment to go forward

00:27:25.189 --> 00:27:32.424
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
