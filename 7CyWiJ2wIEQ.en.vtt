05:03.826 --> 05:22.176
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Krishna’s incarnation.

05:22.176 --> 05:30.966
As you know that Shri Krishna is the incarnation
of Narayana, of Shri Vishnu.

05:30.966 --> 05:42.055
So in every incarnation they carry all their
qualities, all their powers and all their

05:42.055 --> 05:46.285
nature with them.

05:46.285 --> 06:01.355
So when He incarnated He had all the qualities
of Narayana and then that of Rama, but every

06:01.355 --> 06:15.436
incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their
previous life has been misunderstood and have

06:15.436 --> 06:17.206
been carried to the extremes.

06:17.206 --> 06:48.916
That’s why they have to come back again
and again.

06:48.916 --> 07:02.356
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

07:02.356 --> 07:04.506
is the preserver.

07:04.506 --> 07:21.306
He’s the preserver of this creation and
also the preserver of dharma.

07:21.306 --> 07:32.796
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma.

07:32.796 --> 07:43.246
By keeping the dharma all right only, you
could get your realization.

07:43.246 --> 07:52.566
So the job was quite difficult one, I should
say, to keep people in the central path of

07:52.566 --> 07:56.896
Mahalakshmi.

07:56.896 --> 08:12.796
So by first incarnation, you can say that,
He tried to create a benevolent king, as Shri

08:12.796 --> 08:13.796
Rama.

08:13.796 --> 08:17.766
Socrates has described a benevolent king.

08:17.766 --> 08:25.986
But as a result of that, people started thinking
if they have become queen and king, born in

08:25.986 --> 08:33.286
the family of royalty, then they are gods.

08:33.286 --> 08:43.616
Shri Rama was the Purushottama – means He
was the best among all the human beings.

08:43.616 --> 08:52.476
That means He incarnated as a human being,
total human being, showing all the qualities

08:52.476 --> 08:54.706
of human beings.

08:54.706 --> 09:09.036
Like He was, He married the Lakshmi principle
that was Sita, and then also He lived a normal

09:09.036 --> 09:10.176
married life.

09:10.176 --> 09:20.266
When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic
to show how a man should lead his life in

09:20.266 --> 09:24.666
a proper dharma as a married man.

09:24.666 --> 09:34.496
And even when the wife has gone away, how
He was leading a life of complete chastity.

09:34.496 --> 09:40.886
And He never had another marriage, though
many people said that “You should have another

09:40.886 --> 09:42.426
marriage."

09:42.426 --> 09:55.666
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it.

09:55.666 --> 10:04.916
By His life, He showed how a husband should
be with his wife.

10:04.916 --> 10:08.916
But then later on He had another role as the
king.

10:08.916 --> 10:17.606
When He became the king then He found out
that people were criticizing Him because He

10:17.606 --> 10:22.456
brought Sita back from Ravana.

10:22.456 --> 10:29.846
So Shri Rama decided to send Her away from
Him.

10:29.846 --> 10:38.926
How many people in this world, who are in
power, would be that sensible about that power

10:38.926 --> 10:47.216
that they have, that they have to behave in
a manner that they should be ideals, for all

10:47.216 --> 10:52.996
other people who are working under them, for
the administration, for looking after the

10:52.996 --> 10:54.846
country?

10:54.846 --> 11:07.286
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

11:07.286 --> 11:16.666
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people.

11:16.666 --> 11:21.136
So they say the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

11:21.136 --> 11:32.196
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

11:32.196 --> 11:45.816
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace.

11:45.816 --> 11:53.675
So there was no need to have any struggle,
no competition, no fighting, nothing.

11:53.675 --> 12:03.436
So this Benevolent King came as a incarnation
to show us how a king should be, and He lead

12:03.436 --> 12:12.836
a life of a serious type, very dedicated and
serious type of life, how a benevolent king

12:12.836 --> 12:14.626
should be.

12:14.626 --> 12:25.026
As a result of His incarnation – always
people take to something, something which

12:25.026 --> 12:28.406
is not normal.

12:28.406 --> 12:38.156
So because He lived as an ascetic people started
following asceticism.

12:38.156 --> 12:44.876
“We’ll not marry, we’ll not have our
wives, we’ll live like Rama,” all these

12:44.876 --> 12:49.066
things they started, so asceticism grew up.

12:49.066 --> 12:56.536
Before that, before Shri Rama all the saints
used to marry, they used to have wives they

12:56.536 --> 12:59.836
used to have children, they lived a very normal
life.

12:59.836 --> 13:09.126
Only they were saints because they were very
highly evolved people and they lived in ashrams

13:09.126 --> 13:18.296
doing the work of realization and also other
corrections in human beings.

13:18.296 --> 13:27.826
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
“He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

13:27.826 --> 13:32.496
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic."

13:32.496 --> 13:43.305
So this foolish idea of asceticism crawled
in and then people became very austere type,

13:43.305 --> 13:46.086
very austere.

13:46.086 --> 13:53.485
Nobody would laugh, nobody would smile, everything
was very serious, absolutely, and everything

13:53.485 --> 13:58.315
was done in a very dry manner.

13:58.315 --> 14:06.406
So many seekers did not marry but apart from
seekers many seers and saints also did not

14:06.406 --> 14:13.305
marry and because they had no balance, because
marriage gives you a balance, they became

14:13.305 --> 14:21.255
very dry people, very hot tempered people,
and we have some examples of some rishis who

14:21.255 --> 14:30.836
are known for their hot temper and their ascetic
qualities by which they could destroy anyone,

14:30.836 --> 14:36.776
make them into ashes – in Sanskrit it’s
called as Bhasma Karoti.

14:36.776 --> 14:48.636
So these qualities developed, that is the
time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri Rama’s

14:48.636 --> 14:52.546
incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

14:52.546 --> 15:05.315
Sri Krishna’s incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela.

15:05.315 --> 15:09.235
That’s why He’s Leeladhar, He’s called
as Leeladhara.

15:09.235 --> 15:15.935
He was the one who showed that everything
is fun, there’s nothing to be serious, nothing

15:15.935 --> 15:26.185
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole
life is a fun.

15:26.185 --> 15:34.485
He gave this idea because people had become
so austere.

15:34.485 --> 15:43.435
And then also a kind of a funny Brahminism
started, like they would not eat, they created

15:43.435 --> 15:46.426
a caste system which started developing.

15:46.426 --> 15:54.886
The caste was determined by birth, which was
wrong, and they could not eat food.

15:54.886 --> 16:01.396
Then the Brahminism started growing up, quite
strong, and these Brahmins started dominating

16:01.396 --> 16:03.016
others.

16:03.016 --> 16:21.925
So Shri Krishna came and He came as a son
of a milkman (gwale ki ladke).

16:21.925 --> 16:33.766
But they were rich milkmen, very rich milkmen.

16:33.766 --> 16:43.865
Now that is the time, you see, the whole play
was brought forth, and the play was quite

16:43.865 --> 16:58.625
cruel I should say, because one horrible devil,
rakshasa, somehow or other used a lady who

16:58.625 --> 17:11.905
was
mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother also

17:11.905 --> 17:16.245
of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.

17:16.245 --> 17:23.935
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,
so it’s all a play of the same.

17:23.935 --> 17:33.745
So He had an uncle who was a devil, who was
a rakshasa and He was supposed to kill this

17:33.745 --> 17:39.656
uncle – see the play, this is a drama all,
just see the drama as it worked out.

17:39.656 --> 17:47.896
He was supposed to kill this uncle who was
very powerful and who was a devil.

17:47.896 --> 18:04.165
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

18:04.165 --> 18:07.985
He was very young, He was about five years
of age.

18:07.985 --> 18:17.146
And He did all kinds of pranks and He did
all kinds of leelas, like He killed one snake,

18:17.146 --> 18:22.696
very big snake – a cobra – very well known
cobra.

18:22.696 --> 18:30.295
And also He killed many rakshasas and rakshasinis
with His power – in a play.

18:30.295 --> 18:38.026
Just in a play, He used to do it, and you
must have read the stories about Him – how

18:38.026 --> 18:44.946
He showed that there is no need to have a
big army of people as Shri Rama had – He

18:44.946 --> 18:53.855
didn’t use any monkeys or anyone, though
Hanumana was always, was sitting on His chariot.

18:53.855 --> 18:58.466
But He never used all these outside powers.

18:58.466 --> 19:08.345
Only whatever He had the weapons that He used,
to show that there is no need to use any army

19:08.345 --> 19:16.165
or other people to kill a rakshasa.

19:16.165 --> 19:20.625
And all was in a very playful manner.

19:20.625 --> 19:31.416
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

19:31.416 --> 19:40.915
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

19:40.915 --> 19:44.285
accept it because He was not supposed to know.

19:44.285 --> 19:49.675
It’s something like Mahamaya.

19:49.675 --> 20:02.337
But say all the cameras are now giving you
all the evidence of the real Mahamaya, what

20:02.337 --> 20:04.305
She is like.

20:04.305 --> 20:11.726
But one may try to show that you don’t remember,
you don’t have, you have no memory of it.

20:11.726 --> 20:18.706
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

20:18.706 --> 20:25.425
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won’t be able

20:25.425 --> 20:32.516
to stand, or they’ll be frightened, they’ll
be such an awe.

20:32.516 --> 20:40.206
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person.

20:40.206 --> 20:47.415
Like in His childhood, He was very fond of
butter.

20:47.415 --> 20:50.045
And as you know butter is very good for the
throat.

20:50.045 --> 20:55.675
For Vishuddhi I’ve told you many-a-times
that on your tea you put some butter and take

20:55.675 --> 21:00.965
it so that your throat which is dried out
will feel better.

21:00.965 --> 21:10.785
So He was very fond of butter and He would
go and make His friends help Him, and made

21:10.785 --> 21:17.875
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and
break the butter container and would eat all

21:17.875 --> 21:19.836
that butter like a little baby.

21:19.836 --> 21:24.245
So one day His mother said, “All right,
why did you eat butter?”

21:24.245 --> 21:25.596
He said, “I never ate."

21:25.596 --> 21:27.555
She said, “Then what is this on your mouth?”

21:27.555 --> 21:31.206
He said, “This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth."

21:31.206 --> 21:36.675
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

21:36.675 --> 21:37.675
to that extent.

21:37.675 --> 21:39.505
Like “don’t tell lies!

21:39.505 --> 21:40.505
You must not!”

21:40.505 --> 21:43.275
No, there was no fun in this kind of thing.

21:43.275 --> 21:45.326
So He told her a lie.

21:45.326 --> 21:48.295
“See now, these people have put it on my
mouth.

21:48.295 --> 21:55.425
They have eaten all the butter and now I am
the one you are catching!” you see.

21:55.425 --> 21:58.216
So she said, “Really?

21:58.216 --> 22:00.505
Open your mouth!”

22:00.505 --> 22:07.175
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

22:07.175 --> 22:10.346
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth.

22:10.346 --> 22:14.326
The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi,
the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw, and

22:14.326 --> 22:16.196
she just bowed to Him.

22:16.196 --> 22:23.616
Then He says, “Why are you bowing to Me?”
as if nothing has happened.

22:23.616 --> 22:37.546
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

22:37.546 --> 22:47.336
of understanding, and it’s regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

22:47.336 --> 22:52.436
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

22:52.436 --> 22:56.696
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

22:56.696 --> 23:11.976
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

23:11.976 --> 23:13.077
are not attached to their children.

23:13.077 --> 23:14.916
They don’t love their children.

23:14.916 --> 23:20.736
They love their carpets, love everything else
because they can sell it, but they can’t

23:20.736 --> 23:23.275
sell their children.

23:23.275 --> 23:26.856
And that kills the joy.

23:26.856 --> 23:36.155
So the children and the parents are separated
by materialistic ideas that this material

23:36.155 --> 23:40.206
is more important than their own children.

23:40.206 --> 23:45.196
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

23:45.196 --> 23:46.476
steal also.

23:46.476 --> 23:49.226
Now stealing is supposed to be bad.

23:49.226 --> 23:54.216
Some, belongs to somebody else, if you steal,
is bad.

23:54.216 --> 23:58.436
But He was stealing only the butter of His
mother that He had made them.

23:58.436 --> 24:04.875
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

24:04.875 --> 24:12.366
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

24:12.366 --> 24:14.186
very powerful.

24:14.186 --> 24:19.446
So He thought best thing is to go and eat
all the butter so that these ladies won’t

24:19.446 --> 24:21.865
be able to go and sell it.

24:21.865 --> 24:30.456
Also if you see it significantly is this that
we starve our children, we starve our families,

24:30.456 --> 24:33.216
just to have some money.

24:33.216 --> 24:38.796
Money orientation is there, that you can go
and sell your butter to somebody.

24:38.796 --> 24:44.676
With this idea – everything to be sold out,
we have to sell out this, we have to sell

24:44.676 --> 24:46.226
out that.

24:46.226 --> 24:50.166
Nothing is going to be kept with ourselves.

24:50.166 --> 24:58.586
So the children are the only permanent liabilities,
so the children are treated as if they are

24:58.586 --> 25:03.865
just burdens while all other things are good
because you can sell it.

25:03.865 --> 25:09.966
So the whole value system, if it runs down
to money, then children have no place in the

25:09.966 --> 25:11.756
family.

25:11.756 --> 25:23.285
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

25:23.285 --> 25:26.116
and they are to be looked after that way.

25:26.116 --> 25:31.535
Of course they should be told what is dignity
is, how to behave themselves.

25:31.535 --> 25:36.766
But their little, little pranks are to be
understood and enjoyed because only as children

25:36.766 --> 25:43.086
they can do pranks, not as grown ups, so they
should have that much freedom to play pranks

25:43.086 --> 25:46.235
and to play some tricks on you.

25:46.235 --> 25:53.306
Otherwise, they’ll become very serious people
and might become ascetic.

25:53.306 --> 26:00.106
Those parents who are very strict, their children
are never normal; they either are extremely

26:00.106 --> 26:11.245
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down
and they cannot face life.

26:11.245 --> 26:18.765
So both are of the same style because one
cannot face life another cannot be faced by

26:18.765 --> 26:19.765
life.

26:19.765 --> 26:20.765
It’s like this.

26:20.765 --> 26:22.026
Nobody can face such people.

26:22.026 --> 26:26.405
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

26:26.405 --> 26:30.485
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.

26:30.485 --> 26:31.956
So children only care for love.

26:31.956 --> 26:33.405
They don’t know money.

26:33.405 --> 26:34.856
They don’t know anything.

26:34.856 --> 26:40.816
So the love that is you establish in your
child becomes very precious thing.

26:40.816 --> 26:49.006
So the system of Sahaja Yoga is based on divine
love and it can only work when people are

26:49.006 --> 26:50.006
loving.

26:50.006 --> 26:55.645
If they love money, if they love power, if
they love their reputation, they love this,

26:55.645 --> 27:02.775
love that, and not their own children or their
families then they are absolutely losing a

27:02.775 --> 27:09.735
very big part of the society and God knows
what’s going to happen to these children

27:09.735 --> 27:11.056
if you do not have love for your children.

27:11.056 --> 27:17.386
In Shri Krishna’s life, you can see various
things He has shown.

27:17.386 --> 27:27.596
In His, you can say in His epic or in His
biography if you see, you will find how many

27:27.596 --> 27:32.636
facets of life He has handled with such beauty.

27:32.636 --> 27:41.745
Then in His childhood, then He goes and kills
the devil of Kamsa.

27:41.745 --> 27:46.035
That too, how beautifully He does it.

27:46.035 --> 27:49.346
How He kills the people who are surrounding
Him.

27:49.346 --> 27:59.306
How He knows their secrets, how they can be
killed, it shows complete brilliance and very

27:59.306 --> 28:04.086
beautiful organizing the whole thing.

28:04.086 --> 28:14.426
Now imagine one Krishna fought, one Krishna
fought the whole army of that Kamsa, how He

28:14.426 --> 28:18.785
must have done it, because after all He’s
Viraat.

28:18.785 --> 28:26.676
And the, all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands.

28:26.676 --> 28:28.366
He can do whatever He likes.

28:28.366 --> 28:32.076
He can play around as He likes.

28:32.076 --> 28:40.615
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it
is so easy for Him to manage all these things

28:40.615 --> 28:42.995
simultaneously.

28:42.995 --> 28:47.035
Then came His life when He became the king.

28:47.035 --> 28:56.365
When He became the king He wanted, I should
say in a way that, He wanted to establish

28:56.365 --> 29:02.265
people in dharma and He needed the help of
the five elements.

29:02.265 --> 29:09.566
So He made them into five ladies whom He married;
so He has five wives but they are five elements,

29:09.566 --> 29:12.035
part and parcel of His being.

29:12.035 --> 29:20.515
But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached
in His yoga, but He had, for practical purposes

29:20.515 --> 29:22.686
we can say, five wives.

29:22.686 --> 29:28.206
And they were sixteen thousand women who became
His wives.

29:28.206 --> 29:33.495
These sixteen thousand women are nothing but
His sixteen thousand powers because you know

29:33.495 --> 29:44.796
His chakras they have got sixteen petals and
these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata’s

29:44.796 --> 29:50.486
one thousand petals each – so it comes to
sixteen thousand powers.

29:50.486 --> 29:56.996
So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated
as women, were taken away by some horrible

29:56.996 --> 30:03.326
king and He went there, fought that king and
brought these ladies.

30:03.326 --> 30:11.586
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

30:11.586 --> 30:12.836
think that there is good relationship.

30:12.836 --> 30:16.186
They’ll always think there must be something
wrong.

30:16.186 --> 30:20.876
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them.

30:20.876 --> 30:26.156
But mother’s position is different because
mother can have thousand children.

30:26.156 --> 30:32.756
But poor man, even if he has one woman around
him, everybody will say he’s a bad person.

30:32.756 --> 30:38.476
So He had to marry all of them, so-called
marriage, and these sixteen thousand powers

30:38.476 --> 30:46.735
stayed with Him by which He established our
Vishuddhi Chakra.

30:46.735 --> 30:52.586
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

30:52.586 --> 30:59.596
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us – that’s why we are

30:59.596 --> 31:00.596
suffering.

31:00.596 --> 31:10.035
Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when
we catch.

31:10.035 --> 31:18.416
Shri Krishna’s essence is sweetness – madhuriya,
madhuriya.

31:18.416 --> 31:19.605
And His power was Radha.

31:19.605 --> 31:24.775
“Ra” is energy “dha,” means the one
who has sustained the energy.

31:24.775 --> 31:28.096
And Her power was, She was called as Ahlada.

31:28.096 --> 31:32.535
“Ahlada” means joy giving qualities She
had.

31:32.535 --> 31:40.726
So Shri Krishna’s qualities were that He
was Yogeshwara, so He was the witness and

31:40.726 --> 31:41.796
sweetness.

31:41.796 --> 31:54.265
Now a person who shouts and screams and talks
loudly and loses his temper in a very loud

31:54.265 --> 32:03.556
voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time,
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi..

32:03.556 --> 32:10.015
So one should understand that even when you
have to scold somebody, you have to just say,

32:10.015 --> 32:11.035
“What are you doing?

32:11.035 --> 32:13.125
Why are you doing like this?”

32:13.125 --> 32:17.226
Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?”

32:17.226 --> 32:18.226
Finished!

32:18.226 --> 32:19.275
Right Vishuddhi over.

32:19.275 --> 32:20.826
It’s finished now.

32:20.826 --> 32:26.625
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

32:26.625 --> 32:32.535
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

32:32.535 --> 32:37.316
one boy who was serving his parents.

32:37.316 --> 32:44.775
And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing
their feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,

32:44.775 --> 32:47.346
they appeared in the door.

32:47.346 --> 32:51.416
But he said, “Now keep quiet.

32:51.416 --> 32:55.086
My parents are sleeping so you stay there!”

32:55.086 --> 33:01.496
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, “You stay on that."

33:01.496 --> 33:08.816
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping.

33:08.816 --> 33:10.176
Now this is the thing is.

33:10.176 --> 33:22.156
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

33:22.156 --> 33:27.386
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi.

33:27.386 --> 33:33.635
So for that best is to take some rest and
give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by

33:33.635 --> 33:35.796
stopping your talk.

33:35.796 --> 33:39.515
Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk.

33:39.515 --> 33:44.405
For some time if you don’t talk you will
see that your Vishuddhi will be improved,

33:44.405 --> 33:47.056
your problems will be improved.

33:47.056 --> 33:53.576
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

33:53.576 --> 33:56.416
It’s all in one play.

33:56.416 --> 34:03.076
From the, we can say, not from the stomach
but actually from the liver, the heat starts

34:03.076 --> 34:04.196
rising.

34:04.196 --> 34:10.816
It first goes into right heart, as a result
you might become a very hot-tempered husband

34:10.816 --> 34:13.096
or a father or something.

34:13.096 --> 34:15.885
You might get asthma, anything, with that
right heart.

34:15.885 --> 34:18.436
Then it passes on to your right Vishuddhi.

34:18.436 --> 34:24.135
When it goes to your right Vishuddhi then
you become a very irritable, hot-tempered

34:24.135 --> 34:25.135
person.

34:25.135 --> 34:27.806
All the time you shout at someone.

34:27.806 --> 34:28.926
Nobody can talk to you.

34:28.926 --> 34:32.306
If somebody has to talk to you, he has to
use a barge pole in between.

34:32.306 --> 34:34.706
God knows what time he’ll shout at you.

34:34.706 --> 34:40.446
Or maybe, I’ve seen many women lose their
hearing or men lose their hearing when there

34:40.446 --> 34:42.946
is somebody who is shouting at them.

34:42.946 --> 34:49.645
So shouting is a very bad thing for others
and also for yourself because, of course,

34:49.645 --> 34:55.246
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

34:55.246 --> 35:00.716
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet.

35:00.716 --> 35:08.296
But for others it’s even worse because if
you use your anger in that manner then that

35:08.296 --> 35:14.365
person might be just frightened of you, might
develop inferiority complex, might become

35:14.365 --> 35:20.775
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots
or God knows what can happen to a person who

35:20.775 --> 35:24.735
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

35:24.735 --> 35:28.755
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

35:28.755 --> 35:37.995
So from Shri Krishna’s life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

35:37.995 --> 35:51.235
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

35:51.235 --> 35:58.485
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful.

35:58.485 --> 36:02.095
But in modern times the other way round.

36:02.095 --> 36:06.535
They have the music where the right Vishuddhi
is about to break or burst.

36:06.535 --> 36:08.895
I don’t know what sort of a music it is.

36:08.895 --> 36:18.966
When they listen to this music, you see, then
it excites, then it excites you.

36:18.966 --> 36:20.596
It doesn’t make you peaceful.

36:20.596 --> 36:24.066
It excites you, excites you more and more.

36:24.066 --> 36:33.066
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it.

36:33.066 --> 36:40.296
And when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

36:40.296 --> 36:41.296
more.

36:41.296 --> 36:47.056
Then they have to put something near the ear
to hear something otherwise they have no excitement.

36:47.056 --> 36:56.176
All the exciting, we can say all the exciting
cells become numbed.

36:56.176 --> 37:04.946
And you have to really go in for tremendous
effort to create that excitement in those

37:04.946 --> 37:07.135
numbed cells.

37:07.135 --> 37:13.456
So it’s very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

37:13.456 --> 37:19.145
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain.

37:19.145 --> 37:24.706
So then you take to drugs because your brain
is numbed out.

37:24.706 --> 37:30.775
So you take to drugs and when you take to
drugs then you feel that you are all right.

37:30.775 --> 37:35.806
Then again you feel that this drug is not
sufficient then you take stronger drugs.

37:35.806 --> 37:37.125
Then you take more drugs.

37:37.125 --> 37:39.285
It goes on one after another.

37:39.285 --> 37:44.046
Ultimately, it reaches a stage when you are
nowhere.

37:44.046 --> 37:45.236
So it is all self-destructive.

37:45.236 --> 38:12.845
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

38:12.845 --> 38:26.385
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence.

38:26.385 --> 38:31.676
Those who think, who are very dominating,
who are talking in a very dominating manner,

38:31.676 --> 38:39.155
whose right Vishuddhi is catching, should
become silent and should, at least for some

38:39.155 --> 38:42.556
time, should not talk at all.

38:42.556 --> 38:48.865
Maybe you might fix one day, say you can do
it on a … say “I’ll not talk on Monday."

38:48.865 --> 38:53.956
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say “I’ll not talk on Sunday."

38:53.956 --> 38:58.128
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

38:58.128 --> 39:07.475
they will talk the most!

39:07.475 --> 39:13.596
And this shouting and then intimidating people
– you have no right.

39:13.596 --> 39:18.536
You have no business to shout at anyone whatsoever.

39:18.536 --> 39:20.736
What is the need to shout?

39:20.736 --> 39:25.196
After all, you are a human being, another
one is a human being.

39:25.196 --> 39:31.146
God has not given anybody whether it is a
husband, wife, children or anyone.

39:31.146 --> 39:36.196
But I find even these days children shout,
the mother shouts, the father shouts.

39:36.196 --> 39:41.666
If you go in the house, you feel like running
back because you’ll find, hear, nothing

39:41.666 --> 39:43.896
but shouts.

39:43.896 --> 39:51.356
So this kind of a family system will rock,
completely finish that family and there will

39:51.356 --> 39:58.756
be no beautiful relationship between each
other and between the other people.

39:58.756 --> 40:04.056
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

40:04.056 --> 40:05.056
at another.

40:05.056 --> 40:07.296
All over you go you find nothing but shouting.

40:07.296 --> 40:13.876
Even if you take your car little bit this
side there will be a shouting, I mean.

40:13.876 --> 40:18.966
For the slightest excuse, they start shouting
and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.

40:18.966 --> 40:25.316
Now, for politicians, they think it’s the
best way to shout because they can really

40:25.316 --> 40:29.136
impress people by their shouts you see.

40:29.136 --> 40:32.316
So they shout a lot, tell people this that.

40:32.316 --> 40:36.426
When they speak, you should hear there’s
no sweetness in their tongue, nothing of the

40:36.426 --> 40:37.426
kind.

40:37.426 --> 40:40.366
But they shout and by shouting a person gets
frightened.

40:40.366 --> 40:41.896
“All right, you want the vote?

40:41.896 --> 40:43.296
We’ll give you but don’t shout."

40:43.296 --> 40:49.506
That’s how many people get elected and become
big and think that they are very successful

40:49.506 --> 40:50.906
because they have been shouting (laughter).

40:50.906 --> 40:57.726
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

40:57.726 --> 41:04.556
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices.

41:04.556 --> 41:09.746
For Sahaja Yogis it doesn’t behove.

41:09.746 --> 41:19.646
Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet person
to talk, extremely sweet.

41:19.646 --> 41:28.046
Now when you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama
as a person who was a king, and then you have

41:28.046 --> 41:32.226
got Shri Krishna who was a diplomat.

41:32.226 --> 41:34.416
So what is the divine diplomacy?

41:34.416 --> 41:39.996
You don’t have to shout, but you change
the subject.

41:39.996 --> 41:50.506
If you want to bring somebody to a, some,
conclusion – then best thing is first you

41:50.506 --> 41:57.826
change the subject and gradually, if you are
clever enough, then you go on changing, changing

41:57.826 --> 42:01.946
and you bring it back to the right thing.

42:01.946 --> 42:05.456
That’s the clever thing to do.

42:05.456 --> 42:10.576
Otherwise, just by shouting if somebody may
say, “Yes, all right, I’ll do it,” by

42:10.576 --> 42:14.686
the time you are gone they’ll say, “Yah,
I’ll do it."

42:14.686 --> 42:17.206
That means something else.

42:17.206 --> 42:23.446
So you see, he might say, “yes” and “yah”
anytime.

42:23.446 --> 42:29.666
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person.

42:29.666 --> 42:32.456
That’s what I did also in Russia.

42:32.456 --> 42:36.906
I went round and round and round and round
and brought him to the point that we have

42:36.906 --> 42:40.826
to be very independent thing, and I managed
it.

42:40.826 --> 42:42.456
That is Shri Krishna’s style.

42:42.456 --> 42:44.376
You see, because to face it.

42:44.376 --> 42:51.316
Supposing somebody says, “Oh this is my
idea; I’ve decided to do this and that and

42:51.316 --> 42:56.656
everything,” then you should say slowly,
“All right, now I would say what you are

42:56.656 --> 42:58.456
saying is correct, absolutely correct.

42:58.456 --> 43:04.346
I agree with you and what do you think about
the other thing?”

43:04.346 --> 43:05.656
something like that.

43:05.656 --> 43:09.866
And then you should say, “Now, I can suggest.

43:09.866 --> 43:15.536
But I would like to suggest,” like this,
“if you can agree to it."

43:15.536 --> 43:21.086
You see, gradually if you go and talk like
this things can work out and people can feel

43:21.086 --> 43:30.986
really that you have taken time and you have
spent that much time and have accepted their

43:30.986 --> 43:33.067
proposal and things.

43:33.067 --> 43:36.346
And they don’t feel bad.

43:36.346 --> 43:46.596
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy.

43:46.596 --> 43:55.376
Can you tell me?

43:55.376 --> 44:06.546
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

44:06.546 --> 44:09.416
Is benevolence.

44:09.416 --> 44:15.816
You have to achieve the benevolence of the
whole humanity.

44:15.816 --> 44:17.806
This is the essence of it.

44:17.806 --> 44:20.606
If you are doing it, you are not doing for
yourself, for your gain.

44:20.606 --> 44:24.526
You are not doing for the gain of any particular
person.

44:24.526 --> 44:30.466
But you are doing it for the benevolence of
the whole humanity.

44:30.466 --> 44:35.606
So once, you know this is the essence, so
what is the need to shout?

44:35.606 --> 44:38.766
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

44:38.766 --> 44:43.206
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

44:43.206 --> 44:50.566
Like Krishna was asked that “You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

44:50.566 --> 44:52.386
also very pleasing.

44:52.386 --> 44:54.816
Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."

44:54.816 --> 44:58.456
He said, “how can it be?

44:58.456 --> 45:00.086
These two things cannot be.

45:00.086 --> 45:05.056
Supposing you tell the truth people may not
like it, may not please that person.

45:05.056 --> 45:06.266
So He said, “No.

45:06.266 --> 45:10.016
It should be ‘Satyam vadet, hitam vadet,
priyam vadet.'”

45:10.016 --> 45:20.646
That “Tell the truth, tell for the benevolence
and tell the pleasing thing."

45:20.646 --> 45:25.916
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time.

45:25.916 --> 45:29.526
Supposing you tell that person, “Now don’t
go today by plane."

45:29.526 --> 45:31.956
He will not like it, “What do you mean?

45:31.956 --> 45:33.296
I’m going to go."

45:33.296 --> 45:34.846
“No please don’t go.

45:34.846 --> 45:36.006
I request you."

45:36.006 --> 45:41.596
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash.

45:41.596 --> 45:45.646
So he thinks, “This was good because for
my benevolence this has worked out.

45:45.646 --> 45:47.256
So this is something so good."

45:47.256 --> 45:52.766
So immediately, he feels obliged to you and
he feels that you have told him the truth

45:52.766 --> 45:57.006
by which it was his benevolence and that’s
why he’s pleased.

45:57.006 --> 46:03.176
So in the long run if you talk something for
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence

46:03.176 --> 46:10.266
of the spirit, then such a person immediately
thinks that we have really done such a great

46:10.266 --> 46:21.066
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

46:21.066 --> 46:29.056
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter.

46:29.056 --> 46:33.486
It will not have any effect because Shri Krishna,
which is the deity, knows it.

46:33.486 --> 46:38.866
For example, a man is coming to kill somebody
and you know where that man is hiding.

46:38.866 --> 46:41.536
He comes and asks you “Where is that man?”

46:41.536 --> 46:45.506
Are you supposed to tell him the truth “All
right, he’s there.

46:45.506 --> 46:46.946
Go and kill him”?

46:46.946 --> 46:47.946
No.

46:47.946 --> 46:48.966
So what do you have to tell?

46:48.966 --> 46:51.366
You have to tell him that “See.

46:51.366 --> 46:53.726
I’m not going to tell you.

46:53.726 --> 46:55.146
I don’t know.

46:55.146 --> 46:56.146
Doesn’t matter."

46:56.146 --> 47:01.966
Because what he is asking is unauthorized
is anadhikar.

47:01.966 --> 47:06.676
He had no business, he has no authority to
ask such a question.

47:06.676 --> 47:11.326
And he had no authority to extract the answer
from you.

47:11.326 --> 47:14.796
Whether you give him the answer or not answer
is your right.

47:14.796 --> 47:20.726
If you understand that, it is not for the
benevolence for the man who wants to kill,

47:20.726 --> 47:26.886
because tomorrow he will be hanged, and not
also for the benevolence of the person whom

47:26.886 --> 47:28.686
he is seeking out.

47:28.686 --> 47:32.846
So if you do like that then there is no problem.

47:32.846 --> 47:39.906
You’ll find most of the people will just
like you because they will know that you are

47:39.906 --> 47:42.986
sincere, very honest, that you want to be
benevolent.

47:42.986 --> 47:51.296
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

47:51.296 --> 47:55.056
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time.

47:55.056 --> 47:59.956
I have to also tell lies little bit.

47:59.956 --> 48:06.676
But whatever I do you will find out is for
your benevolence, is for your good.

48:06.676 --> 48:08.476
I have to tell you.

48:08.476 --> 48:10.506
I cannot run away from that.

48:10.506 --> 48:12.876
I have to face it.

48:12.876 --> 48:17.546
So you cannot run away from telling people
what you think is right for them.

48:17.546 --> 48:22.286
Specially those about whom you are in charge.

48:22.286 --> 48:26.496
Like you have children, you’ve got a family,
you’ve got other relations, of whom you

48:26.496 --> 48:33.976
are in charge then best thing is that you
have to tell them frankly what you think and

48:33.976 --> 48:35.346
what is right.

48:35.346 --> 48:37.446
It’s your duty.

48:37.446 --> 48:39.436
Then people escape it also.

48:39.436 --> 48:43.416
Many people who don’t want to face their
children, I have seen, they’ll give them

48:43.416 --> 48:45.056
toys, toys after toys.

48:45.056 --> 48:47.786
They will not like to face their children,
tell them, “No, I don’t like it.

48:47.786 --> 48:48.786
This is not good.

48:48.786 --> 48:53.186
I would like you to do like this and this."

48:53.186 --> 48:58.976
So discipline doesn’t mean, discipline doesn’t
mean something very dominating of one person

48:58.976 --> 49:05.386
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

49:05.386 --> 49:09.936
of your spirit and the spirit of others.

49:09.936 --> 49:18.036
That is what is the Sahaj discipline where
you do everything for the benevolence of others

49:18.036 --> 49:22.216
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

49:22.216 --> 49:28.236
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

49:28.236 --> 49:34.956
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people.

49:34.956 --> 49:40.326
Because what They have done is for the benevolence
of the people.

49:40.326 --> 49:45.566
So I would say now we have the left Vishuddhi
and you know very well that left Vishuddhi

49:45.566 --> 49:48.936
is the lightning, in the lightning.

49:48.936 --> 49:51.306
Now what is lightning?

49:51.306 --> 49:56.956
He just shouts and roars.

49:56.956 --> 50:04.956
So a person who has got left Vishuddhi should
actually become a person who can shout and

50:04.956 --> 50:14.546
who can scream and who can, I should say,
expose others as She did.

50:14.546 --> 50:16.926
In the same way, you have to do it.

50:16.926 --> 50:20.936
In that you should not be afraid, you should
not worry, and you should not think “How

50:20.936 --> 50:22.816
can I do it after all?”

50:22.816 --> 50:30.576
But mostly the people who feel guilty is a
type which has lost his confidence and the

50:30.576 --> 50:36.586
ego has entered into the left side – it’s
a very complicated situation.

50:36.586 --> 50:41.206
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it’s very important.

50:41.206 --> 50:44.316
Guilty for this, guilty for that, it’s just
a myth.

50:44.316 --> 50:49.226
We want to escape reality that’s why we
say we are guilty.

50:49.226 --> 50:53.106
So you have to face, face it, your reality.

50:53.106 --> 50:58.406
Try to find out what’s wrong with you and
what’s wrong with another person and face

50:58.406 --> 50:59.406
it.

50:59.406 --> 51:06.866
That is much better than to just say, “Oh
I feel very guilty,” and sitting down, because

51:06.866 --> 51:19.606
Vishnumaya is nothing but like an electricity
and electricity exposes people, she screams

51:19.606 --> 51:26.866
at people, shouts at people, she roars at
people.

51:26.866 --> 51:31.486
So if you have a left Vishuddhi then you have
to use these methods.

51:31.486 --> 51:37.856
I would say a person who has an inferiority
complex should go to the sea and address the

51:37.856 --> 51:43.706
sea and tell, “I am the lord of the sea,
I am this, I am that!” loudly.

51:43.706 --> 51:48.686
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go – also

51:48.686 --> 51:52.046
same way – when they try they’ll become
great speakers.

51:52.046 --> 51:58.236
It will be a very good idea for you to go
and just to give a big lecture and with that

51:58.236 --> 52:09.966
big lecture you can always show that you are
not suffering from any inferiority complex

52:09.966 --> 52:22.806
but you are expressing yourself in a clear-cut
way.

52:22.806 --> 52:32.016
So now you will see the power of Shri Krishna
is of the throat, of the right side, where

52:32.016 --> 52:34.116
what is the power He has got?

52:34.116 --> 52:39.916
The power is that He is sweetness.

52:39.916 --> 52:46.416
He has the power of the shouting – or you
can say with which, the vocal chord as you

52:46.416 --> 52:47.416
call it.

52:47.416 --> 52:54.296
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

52:54.296 --> 52:55.976
a contrast.

52:55.976 --> 53:00.826
And the same thing happens with Vishnumaya
too.

53:00.826 --> 53:07.126
Now Vishnumaya is the potential power in the,
say, in the clouds, is a potential one.

53:07.126 --> 53:15.166
But what She does is to scream, shout and
show Her existence, that She exists.

53:15.166 --> 53:20.146
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

53:20.146 --> 53:23.836
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.

53:23.836 --> 53:27.286
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

53:27.286 --> 53:31.436
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well.

53:31.436 --> 53:38.856
So though She is the sister of Shri Krishna
She is in a way very much subtler because

53:38.856 --> 53:41.706
She helps you in such a subtle manner.

53:41.706 --> 53:47.676
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it – you’ll be surprised My vibrations

53:47.676 --> 53:49.716
are passing through this.

53:49.716 --> 53:56.906
It is bombarding this and from here, they
are going anywhere you want them to go.

53:56.906 --> 54:02.386
You can put a computer on the other side and
you can computerize Me.

54:02.386 --> 54:11.306
It is such a remarkable thing that the one
which is supposed to shout, scream and roar

54:11.306 --> 54:19.956
is the one which is on the left hand side
so that it exists in the people in a potential

54:19.956 --> 54:20.956
way.

54:20.956 --> 54:31.086
In the people who are feeling guilty, who
are suffering from inferiority complex, who

54:31.086 --> 54:35.826
are sly, who feel they are good for nothing.

54:35.826 --> 54:37.356
She exists in them.

54:37.356 --> 54:38.876
See the contrast again.

54:38.876 --> 54:49.626
She exists in them that Her power, She exists
in a person, or expresses in a person who

54:49.626 --> 54:55.396
is not self confident.

54:55.396 --> 55:00.796
And then She asserts Her power by which persons
become self confident.

55:00.796 --> 55:07.986
This is how Her working comes in and that
is potentially within us also.

55:07.986 --> 55:13.636
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there.

55:13.636 --> 55:19.896
Any moment we decide, we can become great
speakers, we can expose people.

55:19.896 --> 55:23.206
We’ll be like lightning, we can roar.

55:23.206 --> 55:26.306
But normally we are not.

55:26.306 --> 55:32.356
So it gives balance to both sides of people.

55:32.356 --> 55:39.466
But in the center when you rise – the kundalini
rises – most of the people have their Vishuddhi

55:39.466 --> 55:42.816
caught up, most of the people.

55:42.816 --> 55:47.356
So they have to either see that they are not
guilty or they have to see that there is no

55:47.356 --> 55:51.556
shouting – nothing – they are not aggressive
in their shouts.

55:51.556 --> 55:59.316
And, plus, they have to see that they are
completely in balance with themselves.

55:59.316 --> 56:05.816
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

56:05.816 --> 56:09.136
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet.

56:09.136 --> 56:10.346
Artificially.

56:10.346 --> 56:16.216
They have to take out some money so they’ll
be extremely sweet and nice.

56:16.216 --> 56:23.386
Such people are really going to go to hell
because they are using the power of Shri Krishna

56:23.386 --> 56:28.346
in a very absurd manner and for that, they
cannot be spared.

56:28.346 --> 56:31.786
So those who are artificially sweet are good
for nothing.

56:31.786 --> 56:40.016
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

56:40.016 --> 56:53.186
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

56:53.186 --> 56:58.206
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

56:58.206 --> 57:01.396
who might be feeling that “Mother is saying
to me."

57:01.396 --> 57:05.856
I’m not saying to anyone as such, it’s
a general talk.

57:05.856 --> 57:10.936
So what I’m saying is that if you are a
person who is a shouting type, please bring

57:10.936 --> 57:17.066
it round and keep it in check and take rest,
give rest to your throat.

57:17.066 --> 57:22.756
Some people are very happy if they are told
that “Today collector sahib is in rest."

57:22.756 --> 57:27.486
They said, “Permanently or for a short time?”

57:27.486 --> 57:31.856
Because he’s the one, if he’s a shouting
fellow, nobody wants to see him.

57:31.856 --> 57:37.026
No one likes any person who shouts, no one
likes.

57:37.026 --> 57:39.916
Even the nearest and dearest don’t like
it.

57:39.916 --> 57:46.326
Of course they tolerate, is different, but
they don’t like it they don’t want it.

57:46.326 --> 57:52.186
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

57:52.186 --> 57:59.916
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

57:59.916 --> 58:05.106
Shri Krishna’s melodious music.

58:05.106 --> 58:10.758
Unless and until we have a beautiful, sweet
music in our heart we can never be, never

58:10.758 --> 58:13.096
be good Sahaj Yogis.

58:13.096 --> 58:23.036
I hope today’s evening puja, though has
been rather late, doesn’t matter, will help

58:23.036 --> 58:28.416
you to think about it, improving your Vishuddhi,
working it out.

58:28.416 --> 58:36.886
And then to look at the Viraat and find out
what’s wrong with you, get it corrected

58:36.886 --> 58:48.176
– which can be done by anyone – and see
that you just have a full idea about yourself,

58:48.176 --> 58:49.526
about your Vishuddhi.

58:49.526 --> 58:55.446
And that’s only possible, only again it’s
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.

58:55.446 --> 59:00.116
If you don’t have a good Vishuddhi you can
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi

59:00.116 --> 59:03.496
point only, you become the witness.

59:03.496 --> 59:06.706
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point.

59:06.706 --> 59:10.446
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

59:10.446 --> 59:17.006
If you have achieved the witness nature then
you can see in your Vishuddhi what’s wrong

59:17.006 --> 59:23.076
with you, what’s wrong with your problems,
with your atmosphere, everything, and you

59:23.076 --> 59:27.296
will end up here only thinking, “Oh, this
is the one that is wrong."

59:27.296 --> 59:34.976
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

59:34.976 --> 59:41.606
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain.

59:41.606 --> 59:47.946
That’s what I told you that the fat of the
stomach goes in the brain.

59:47.946 --> 59:56.116
So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and
becomes what we call as Viraat, Akhbar.

59:56.116 --> 01:00:04.596
And when He becomes Akhbar, then He’s the
brain in the big macrocosm.

01:00:04.596 --> 01:00:09.266
He’s the brain.

01:00:09.266 --> 01:00:15.546
So people who worship Shri Krishna become
brainy people without ego.

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:21.036
Their brain develops and they have no ego
about it.

01:00:21.036 --> 01:00:33.086
Egoless intelligence, which I call as the
pure intelligence, starts manifesting.

01:00:33.086 --> 01:00:46.986
May God bless you all.

01:00:46.986 --> 01:01:00.516
After this puja now you know that I’m going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

01:01:00.516 --> 01:01:01.626
It’s terrible.

01:01:01.626 --> 01:01:09.417
And from Finland to Moscow, Moscow to India,
India to Japan, and Japan to Los Angeles and

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:12.676
Los Angeles to New Zealand, New Zealand to
Australia.

01:01:12.676 --> 01:01:16.176
So this will be like this everyday practically,
I think.

01:01:16.176 --> 01:01:20.496
But whatever it is I’m going now and now
you have some time.

01:01:20.496 --> 01:01:29.446
We have lot of time now in between till I
come in October to trouble you again.

01:01:29.446 --> 01:01:35.846
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

01:01:35.846 --> 01:01:39.116
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out.

01:01:39.116 --> 01:01:47.936
This is very important because I don’t need
any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the rest

01:01:47.936 --> 01:01:48.936
of the world needs it.

01:01:48.936 --> 01:01:50.696
But despite that I’m working so hard.

01:01:50.696 --> 01:01:53.266
So you have to think that “Mother is now
gone out, doesn’t matter.

01:01:53.266 --> 01:01:58.396
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it."

01:01:58.396 --> 01:02:01.046
So please work out something till I come back.

01:02:01.046 --> 01:02:10.036
I’ll be back here again in October, then
we’ll see what we can do and achieve further.

01:02:10.036 --> 01:02:15.236
But let’s see what you have achieved and
bring them to some conclusions, bring them

01:02:15.236 --> 01:02:17.646
to some fruits.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:19.986
And that is what I’m expecting.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:27.946
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

01:02:27.946 --> 01:02:33.746
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much.

01:02:33.746 --> 01:02:39.866
I don’t know if you know the names of all
the leaders or not, but it is worth knowing

01:02:39.866 --> 01:02:48.136
all the leaders of all the countries and paying
your attention to them and praying that they

01:02:48.136 --> 01:02:59.306
should be able to deliver blessings of Sahaja
Yoga to everyone.

01:02:59.306 --> 01:03:07.786
Also they should be able to have visions,
to see what they can do and how they can combine

01:03:07.786 --> 01:03:11.996
different countries and how they can work
out through their own countries.

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:18.466
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

01:03:18.466 --> 01:03:27.226
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did.

01:03:27.226 --> 01:03:30.906
They worked very hard and achieved such a
lot of things.

01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:36.886
And I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis
who are with them, who have helped so much.

01:03:36.886 --> 01:03:37.976
Thank you very much, all of you.
