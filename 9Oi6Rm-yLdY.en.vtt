00:01.720 --> 00:10.353
1987-0111 Commitment and Dedication Puja, Paithan, India

00:11.040 --> 00:14.488
You must have felt the vibrations of this place,

00:14.688 --> 00:18.938
they are tremendous. And that we should come here

00:19.138 --> 00:26.096
after so many years is really very much surprising.

00:29.258 --> 00:34.560
This place has a great connection with me, as such,

00:34.760 --> 00:40.028
because my forefathers ruled in this place.

00:40.228 --> 00:46.532
And this was the capital of Shalivahanas.

00:46.732 --> 00:52.164
It’s called as "Pratishthan" but then they made it easier as "Paithan".

00:52.364 --> 00:55.850
They were the rulers here for thousands of years

00:56.050 --> 01:01.303
and they are the ones who started this Shalivahan dynasty.

01:01.503 --> 01:09.220
Actually they called themselves as "Satvahan", means "seven vahanas".

01:09.420 --> 01:15.904
They represented the seven vahanas of the seven chakras.

01:16.104 --> 01:19.045
It’s surprising how it is so Sahaja.

01:19.245 --> 01:26.298
After that there was a great poet as you know about him, Gyaneshwara.

01:26.498 --> 01:30.551
He came here and he was born very close to this place.

01:30.751 --> 01:34.317
He was here for quite some time.

01:34.517 --> 01:40.757
And there was one fellow, who was a very supra-conscious person,

01:40.957 --> 01:48.370
who challenged him. His name was Changdev. So he said that,

01:48.570 --> 01:55.737
"What do you have with you to show that you have got God with you?"

01:55.937 --> 02:04.723
And there was a male buffalo with him, male buffalo,

02:04.924 --> 02:10.743
which was just walking on the road,

02:10.943 --> 02:17.826
and Gyaneshwara made that buffalo say Veda mantras.

02:19.569 --> 02:25.197
And this Changdev tried to show some tricks.

02:25.397 --> 02:28.192
And Gyaneshwara, with his brothers and sister,

02:28.392 --> 02:32.200
were sitting on a broken wall

02:32.400 --> 02:39.172
and he made the wall to move with all of them in the air.

02:39.372 --> 02:41.875
And then he realised, Changdev,

02:42.075 --> 02:47.184
that this is sort of an incarnation on this Earth.

02:47.384 --> 02:53.656
Apart from there is another great poet called Eknath

02:53.856 --> 02:59.046
who wrote lots of folk songs, like Namadeva,

02:59.246 --> 03:04.828
describing Sahaja Yoga.

03:05.726 --> 03:12.951
So this place had some sort of attractive focus of vibrations

03:13.152 --> 03:21.524
for all these great saint to come and settle down here.

03:21.724 --> 03:26.563
They have excavated lots of old things about this place

03:26.763 --> 03:33.853
and the sari that is given to Goddess here is made in this place,

03:34.053 --> 03:36.471
called as paithani.

03:36.672 --> 03:40.501
It started at the time of Shalivahana and that art is still there.

03:40.701 --> 03:45.029
That’s the only sari in which they use real gold

03:45.229 --> 03:51.632
as the thread, real gold,just for the Goddess.

03:51.832 --> 03:56.679
So this place is still very vibrating.

03:56.879 --> 04:03.108
It’s out of the way to the people to come down, thank God,

04:03.308 --> 04:09.362
so is still maintained its own vibrations,
and its goodness and its purity.

04:09.562 --> 04:14.096
And you are all very lucky people in this group to have come to this place

04:14.296 --> 04:19.146
and to have visited this.

04:19.346 --> 04:23.287
As you will go round, you will see there’s a beautiful garden next to it.

04:23.487 --> 04:29.653
The River Godavari is called The Ganga, The Ganges of the South.

04:29.853 --> 04:34.513
It starts from Nasik where you were before and then brought here.

04:34.713 --> 04:41.477
And a big dam is made for the supply of water all over,

04:41.677 --> 04:45.652
which you can see on your way. There’s a beautiful garden nearby.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.550
And Eknath’s temple is just behind here,

04:48.750 --> 04:55.034
so we can all go and have a look at it also.

05:00.183 --> 05:04.401
I’m happy you went and saw Ajanta Caves.

05:04.601 --> 05:08.424
It should show you how people were dedicated,

05:08.624 --> 05:11.901
to build all that in ten centuries.

05:12.101 --> 05:17.745
They had not seen Buddha at all. Buddha never came to the South of India.

05:17.945 --> 05:23.179
Just believing in Buddha, what work they did, what sacrifices.

05:23.379 --> 05:27.968
How they built it?

05:28.168 --> 05:31.198
They had to go through very difficult times

05:31.398 --> 05:36.408
because there was no water, there was no communication, nothing.

05:36.608 --> 05:39.177
And they used the stones, you must have seen there,

05:39.377 --> 05:43.255
of different colours and different hues,

05:43.455 --> 05:46.524
which are created by Mother Earth. And when you break them,

05:46.724 --> 05:50.805
inside those egg-like stones,

05:51.005 --> 05:56.644
you get beautiful semi-precious stones.

05:56.844 --> 06:00.871
They dissolve them in some sort of an indigenous solvent

06:01.071 --> 06:05.648
and use it for painting and that’s how the paintings are today surviving.

06:05.848 --> 06:07.848
You can’t see without lights,

06:08.049 --> 06:10.694
so how they must have painted it at that time?

06:10.894 --> 06:13.518
What sort of eyes they must be having?

06:13.718 --> 06:18.549
Their dedication gave them this power that they could build it.

06:18.749 --> 06:22.513
And they carried on for ten centuries this work.

06:22.713 --> 06:25.458
If Sahaja Yoga can carried for ten centuries,

06:25.658 --> 06:30.029
this world would be a different place.

06:30.229 --> 06:35.599
So, one has to learn that we have to dedicate.

06:35.799 --> 06:39.752
We must full dedicate ourselves.

06:39.952 --> 06:43.291
We are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga.

06:43.491 --> 06:48.935
Like, in the beginning people have problems about their families

06:49.135 --> 06:51.280
so they think that God should solve the problem

06:51.480 --> 06:54.247
because they have come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga now,

06:54.447 --> 06:56.450
so God must solve their problems.

06:56.651 --> 06:59.743
Now, they have problems with their jobs, God must solve their problem.

06:59.943 --> 07:03.602
If they have problems with their relations, God must solve the problem.

07:03.802 --> 07:05.817
That’s a sort of job given to God

07:06.018 --> 07:09.167
because they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.

07:09.368 --> 07:12.488
Then, after that God must give them money,

07:12.688 --> 07:17.069
He must provide them for everything and He must look after them,

07:17.269 --> 07:20.249
for no commitment at all, there’s no commitment,

07:20.449 --> 07:22.796
nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga.

07:22.996 --> 07:25.889
But God is committed and God has to work it out.

07:26.089 --> 07:29.890
Then they start, some people foolishly start using in Sahaja Yoga

07:30.090 --> 07:35.273
for other purposes, like earning money or earning power,

07:35.473 --> 07:41.422
or name or fame or domination or anything.

07:42.398 --> 07:48.802
These are the steps which are going down, not upwards.

07:49.003 --> 07:51.240
And then, once you go down, you don’t realise

07:51.440 --> 07:54.939
whether you are going upward or downward.

07:55.139 --> 08:00.790
So in dedication one has to see, "What have I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga?

08:00.990 --> 08:03.762
All the time, I have problems. All the time I say,

08:03.962 --> 08:07.208
'I can’t do this because of that. I can’t do that because of this,

08:07.408 --> 08:10.481
this is the problem, this I would like to do this I would like to do.'"

08:10.681 --> 08:14.160
All the time there’s an "I, I, I and I".

08:14.361 --> 08:20.218
"But what have I dedicated? What time have given to Sahaja Yoga?

08:20.418 --> 08:26.367
How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga?" Nothing at all.

08:27.414 --> 08:29.990
People don’t even take leave for Sahaja Yoga.

08:30.190 --> 08:33.764
They can’t do anything for it. These people not only took leave

08:33.964 --> 08:36.709
but permanently went and settled in that place,

08:36.909 --> 08:40.595
in that farfetched place, without any machinery, without anything.

08:40.795 --> 08:46.329
They did that whole painting and the whole excavation

08:46.529 --> 08:50.958
and all that, what you call, the entire work

08:51.158 --> 08:59.203
of such a tremendous volume that is impossible in these modern times.

08:59.403 --> 09:02.679
Nobody can recreate something like that, with your machinery,

09:02.879 --> 09:06.660
with everything because people don’t have dedication.

09:06.860 --> 09:09.762
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves onto a point,

09:09.962 --> 09:14.804
"What did I do? What did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing.

09:15.004 --> 09:19.288
It’s only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself,

09:19.488 --> 09:24.416
or for my job, or for something."

09:24.616 --> 09:28.650
What is our commitment?

09:28.851 --> 09:32.092
And without commitment purity cannot come in.

09:32.292 --> 09:37.436
You’ll go up and down like a yo-yo.

09:37.636 --> 09:40.603
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

09:40.803 --> 09:44.705
If there are even five people

09:44.905 --> 09:47.181
who were really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga,

09:47.381 --> 09:52.129
it can be built up that way.

09:54.892 --> 09:59.047
But the problem is everybody shares with each other,

09:59.247 --> 10:02.609
this kind of non-committal behaviour.

10:02.809 --> 10:06.328
And that’s something not good.

10:06.528 --> 10:09.707
Committed means that even if we have to give our life,

10:09.908 --> 10:12.306
we should do it;

10:12.507 --> 10:18.702
even if we have to give up everything, we should do it.

10:18.902 --> 10:22.100
But all other considerations are to be taken there,

10:22.300 --> 10:26.486
everything should work out, it all should be joy all the time,

10:26.686 --> 10:28.923
you must get your jobs, you must get your wives,

10:29.123 --> 10:31.564
you must get everything, children, properly done.

10:31.764 --> 10:37.470
Everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.

10:38.658 --> 10:40.950
And when this commitment will start,

10:41.150 --> 10:45.020
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will spread likely.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.676
Even falsehood when people are committed,

10:48.876 --> 10:50.883
like you see in all other religions,

10:51.084 --> 10:57.508
every religion they did that,
and how much it has spread.

10:57.708 --> 11:00.280
Of course Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful,

11:00.480 --> 11:02.899
it blesses you all the time.

11:03.099 --> 11:06.238
It gives you a very long rope to hang you also sometimes.

11:06.438 --> 11:10.512
One must know that is a blessing of that kind also.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.319
So one has to be very, very alert

11:13.519 --> 11:17.280
that God has chosen us for such a special work

11:17.480 --> 11:24.547
and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.

11:24.748 --> 11:29.651
All those who are wise will take this and understand

11:29.851 --> 11:35.169
that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it’s useless,

11:35.369 --> 11:39.352
it’s good for nothing,

11:39.552 --> 11:43.532
it has no meaning.

11:43.732 --> 11:49.179
And this has to come first from the leaders and then from others:

11:49.380 --> 11:56.190
complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.

11:56.391 --> 12:00.266
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up anything.

12:00.466 --> 12:03.523
For my sake, you don’t have to do anything, but for your own sake,

12:03.723 --> 12:08.254
for your own betterment, you have to do it.

12:08.454 --> 12:10.720
I hope next time when you come to India,

12:10.920 --> 12:17.501
you will be coming better prepared for commitments.

12:17.832 --> 12:21.660
It’s not only money, it’s not only

12:21.861 --> 12:24.835
your talking about, your saying about it, writing about it,

12:25.035 --> 12:29.493
but it is through your own being it should happen.

12:29.693 --> 12:33.235
You all should become the source of energy

12:33.435 --> 12:37.808
that I want to emit all over the world,

12:38.008 --> 12:41.730
that light which is going to enlighten.

12:41.930 --> 12:44.866
No amount of artificiality is going to work it out,

12:45.066 --> 12:47.678
but complete genuineness within you.

12:47.878 --> 12:50.920
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they didn’t have Mother

12:51.120 --> 12:55.268
to help them. Gyaneshwara’s life if you read, you will be shocked.

12:55.468 --> 13:01.825
He didn’t have even shoes to walk. He was treated so badly

13:02.025 --> 13:05.177
because his father was a sanyasi and was married

13:05.377 --> 13:08.036
so they said that, "These are the children of a sanyasi."

13:08.236 --> 13:12.672
They had no food to eat, and they have to walk for miles together barefoot.

13:12.872 --> 13:15.399
They had no blessings of The Mother on them.

13:15.599 --> 13:18.182
Despite that they kept to Sahaja Yoga,

13:18.382 --> 13:25.132
they kept to their blessings of being one with God.

13:26.244 --> 13:29.935
Because they achieved that state.

13:30.135 --> 13:38.664
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence

13:38.864 --> 13:41.539
that you get all the blessings. But that doesn’t mean

13:41.739 --> 13:45.652
that you should stagnate, that you should not progress.

13:45.852 --> 13:49.550
One has to progress higher and higher.

13:49.750 --> 13:54.924
One has to decide the commitment: "I am committed to Sahaja Yoga",

13:55.125 --> 14:00.335
That is what you have to be, committed.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.460
May God bless you all.
