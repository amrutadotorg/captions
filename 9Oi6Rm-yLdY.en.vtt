1987-0111 Commitment and Dedication Puja, Paithan, India

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.488
You must have felt the vibrations of this place,

00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:18.938
they are tremendous. And that we should come here

00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:26.096
after so many years is really very much surprising.

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:34.560
This place has a great connection with me, as such,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.028
because my forefathers ruled in this place.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:46.532
And this was the capital of Shalivahanas.

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:52.164
It’s called as "Pratishthan" but then they made it easier as "Paithan".

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:55.850
They were the rulers here for thousands of years

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.303
and they are the ones who started this Shalivahan dynasty.

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:09.220
Actually they called themselves as "Satvahan", means "seven vahanas".

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.904
They represented the seven vahanas of the seven chakras.

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:19.045
It’s surprising how it is so Sahaja.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:26.298
After that there was a great poet as you know about him, Gyaneshwara.

00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:30.551
He came here and he was born very close to this place.

00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.317
He was here for quite some time.

00:01:34.517 --> 00:01:40.757
And there was one fellow, who was a very supra-conscious person,

00:01:40.957 --> 00:01:48.370
who challenged him. His name was Changdev. So he said that,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.737
"What do you have with you to show that you have got God with you?"

00:01:55.937 --> 00:02:04.723
And there was a male buffalo with him, male buffalo,

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:10.743
which was just walking on the road,

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:17.826
and Gyaneshwara made that buffalo say Veda mantras.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.197
And this Changdev tried to show some tricks.

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:28.192
And Gyaneshwara, with his brothers and sister,

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:32.200
were sitting on a broken wall

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.172
and he made the wall to move with all of them in the air.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:41.875
And then he realised, Changdev,

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:47.184
that this is sort of an incarnation on this Earth.

00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:53.656
Apart from there is another great poet called Eknath

00:02:53.856 --> 00:02:59.046
who wrote lots of folk songs, like Namadeva,

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:04.828
describing Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:12.951
So this place had some sort of attractive focus of vibrations

00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:21.524
for all these great saint to come and settle down here.

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:26.563
They have excavated lots of old things about this place

00:03:26.763 --> 00:03:33.853
and the sari that is given to Goddess here is made in this place,

00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:36.471
called as paithani.

00:03:36.672 --> 00:03:40.501
It started at the time of Shalivahana and that art is still there.

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:45.029
That’s the only sari in which they use real gold

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:51.632
as the thread, real gold,just for the Goddess.

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:56.679
So this place is still very vibrating.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.108
It’s out of the way to the people to come down, thank God,

00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:09.362
so is still maintained its own vibrations,
and its goodness and its purity.

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:14.096
And you are all very lucky people in this group to have come to this place

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:19.146
and to have visited this.

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:23.287
As you will go round, you will see there’s a beautiful garden next to it.

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:29.653
The River Godavari is called The Ganga, The Ganges of the South.

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:34.513
It starts from Nasik where you were before and then brought here.

00:04:34.713 --> 00:04:41.477
And a big dam is made for the supply of water all over,

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:45.652
which you can see on your way. There’s a beautiful garden nearby.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:48.550
And Eknath’s temple is just behind here,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.034
so we can all go and have a look at it also.

00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:04.401
I’m happy you went and saw Ajanta Caves.

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.424
It should show you how people were dedicated,

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:11.901
to build all that in ten centuries.

00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:17.745
They had not seen Buddha at all. Buddha never came to the South of India.

00:05:17.945 --> 00:05:23.179
Just believing in Buddha, what work they did, what sacrifices.

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.968
How they built it?

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:31.198
They had to go through very difficult times

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:36.408
because there was no water, there was no communication, nothing.

00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:39.177
And they used the stones, you must have seen there,

00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:43.255
of different colours and different hues,

00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:46.524
which are created by Mother Earth. And when you break them,

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:50.805
inside those egg-like stones,

00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:56.644
you get beautiful semi-precious stones.

00:05:56.844 --> 00:06:00.871
They dissolve them in some sort of an indigenous solvent

00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:05.648
and use it for painting and that’s how the paintings are today surviving.

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:07.848
You can’t see without lights,

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:10.694
so how they must have painted it at that time?

00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:13.518
What sort of eyes they must be having?

00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:18.549
Their dedication gave them this power that they could build it.

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.513
And they carried on for ten centuries this work.

00:06:22.713 --> 00:06:25.458
If Sahaja Yoga can carried for ten centuries,

00:06:25.658 --> 00:06:30.029
this world would be a different place.

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.599
So, one has to learn that we have to dedicate.

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:39.752
We must full dedicate ourselves.

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:43.291
We are not here to gain everything out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:48.935
Like, in the beginning people have problems about their families

00:06:49.135 --> 00:06:51.280
so they think that God should solve the problem

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.247
because they have come to Sahaja Yoga to oblige Sahaja Yoga now,

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.450
so God must solve their problems.

00:06:56.651 --> 00:06:59.743
Now, they have problems with their jobs, God must solve their problem.

00:06:59.943 --> 00:07:03.602
If they have problems with their relations, God must solve the problem.

00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:05.817
That’s a sort of job given to God

00:07:06.018 --> 00:07:09.167
because they have very graciously joined Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:09.368 --> 00:07:12.488
Then, after that God must give them money,

00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:17.069
He must provide them for everything and He must look after them,

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:20.249
for no commitment at all, there’s no commitment,

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:22.796
nobody has any commitment in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:25.889
But God is committed and God has to work it out.

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:29.890
Then they start, some people foolishly start using in Sahaja Yoga

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.273
for other purposes, like earning money or earning power,

00:07:35.473 --> 00:07:41.422
or name or fame or domination or anything.

00:07:42.398 --> 00:07:48.802
These are the steps which are going down, not upwards.

00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:51.240
And then, once you go down, you don’t realise

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.939
whether you are going upward or downward.

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:00.790
So in dedication one has to see, "What have I dedicated for Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.762
All the time, I have problems. All the time I say,

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:07.208
'I can’t do this because of that. I can’t do that because of this,

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:10.481
this is the problem, this I would like to do this I would like to do.'"

00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:14.160
All the time there’s an "I, I, I and I".

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:20.218
"But what have I dedicated? What time have given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:20.418 --> 00:08:26.367
How much money have I given to Sahaja Yoga?" Nothing at all.

00:08:27.414 --> 00:08:29.990
People don’t even take leave for Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.764
They can’t do anything for it. These people not only took leave

00:08:33.964 --> 00:08:36.709
but permanently went and settled in that place,

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:40.595
in that farfetched place, without any machinery, without anything.

00:08:40.795 --> 00:08:46.329
They did that whole painting and the whole excavation

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:50.958
and all that, what you call, the entire work

00:08:51.158 --> 00:08:59.203
of such a tremendous volume that is impossible in these modern times.

00:08:59.403 --> 00:09:02.679
Nobody can recreate something like that, with your machinery,

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:06.660
with everything because people don’t have dedication.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.762
So for Sahaja Yoga we have to put ourselves onto a point,

00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:14.804
"What did I do? What did I sacrifice for Sahaja Yoga? Nothing.

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:19.288
It’s only for my own child, or maybe for my wife, or for myself,

00:09:19.488 --> 00:09:24.416
or for my job, or for something."

00:09:24.616 --> 00:09:28.650
What is our commitment?

00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.092
And without commitment purity cannot come in.

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:37.436
You’ll go up and down like a yo-yo.

00:09:37.636 --> 00:09:40.603
We are committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:40.803 --> 00:09:44.705
If there are even five people

00:09:44.905 --> 00:09:47.181
who were really, fully committed to Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:52.129
it can be built up that way.

00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:59.047
But the problem is everybody shares with each other,

00:09:59.247 --> 00:10:02.609
this kind of non-committal behaviour.

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:06.328
And that’s something not good.

00:10:06.528 --> 00:10:09.707
Committed means that even if we have to give our life,

00:10:09.908 --> 00:10:12.306
we should do it;

00:10:12.507 --> 00:10:18.702
even if we have to give up everything, we should do it.

00:10:18.902 --> 00:10:22.100
But all other considerations are to be taken there,

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.486
everything should work out, it all should be joy all the time,

00:10:26.686 --> 00:10:28.923
you must get your jobs, you must get your wives,

00:10:29.123 --> 00:10:31.564
you must get everything, children, properly done.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:37.470
Everything to be done by Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.950
And when this commitment will start,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:45.020
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will spread likely.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.676
Even falsehood when people are committed,

00:10:48.876 --> 00:10:50.883
like you see in all other religions,

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:57.508
every religion they did that,
and how much it has spread.

00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:00.280
Of course Sahaja Yoga is blessings, is blissful,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.899
it blesses you all the time.

00:11:03.099 --> 00:11:06.238
It gives you a very long rope to hang you also sometimes.

00:11:06.438 --> 00:11:10.512
One must know that is a blessing of that kind also.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.319
So one has to be very, very alert

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:17.280
that God has chosen us for such a special work

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:24.547
and we have to be fully committed to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:24.748 --> 00:11:29.651
All those who are wise will take this and understand

00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:35.169
that the life is only worth this. Otherwise it’s useless,

00:11:35.369 --> 00:11:39.352
it’s good for nothing,

00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:43.532
it has no meaning.

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:49.179
And this has to come first from the leaders and then from others:

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:56.190
complete commitment to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:56.391 --> 00:12:00.266
It doesn’t mean that you have to give up anything.

00:12:00.466 --> 00:12:03.523
For my sake, you don’t have to do anything, but for your own sake,

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:08.254
for your own betterment, you have to do it.

00:12:08.454 --> 00:12:10.720
I hope next time when you come to India,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.501
you will be coming better prepared for commitments.

00:12:17.832 --> 00:12:21.660
It’s not only money, it’s not only

00:12:21.861 --> 00:12:24.835
your talking about, your saying about it, writing about it,

00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:29.493
but it is through your own being it should happen.

00:12:29.693 --> 00:12:33.235
You all should become the source of energy

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:37.808
that I want to emit all over the world,

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:41.730
that light which is going to enlighten.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.866
No amount of artificiality is going to work it out,

00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:47.678
but complete genuineness within you.

00:12:47.878 --> 00:12:50.920
Look at these saints, they had nobody, they didn’t have Mother

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.268
to help them. Gyaneshwara’s life if you read, you will be shocked.

00:12:55.468 --> 00:13:01.825
He didn’t have even shoes to walk. He was treated so badly

00:13:02.025 --> 00:13:05.177
because his father was a sanyasi and was married

00:13:05.377 --> 00:13:08.036
so they said that, "These are the children of a sanyasi."

00:13:08.236 --> 00:13:12.672
They had no food to eat, and they have to walk for miles together barefoot.

00:13:12.872 --> 00:13:15.399
They had no blessings of The Mother on them.

00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:18.182
Despite that they kept to Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:18.382 --> 00:13:25.132
they kept to their blessings of being one with God.

00:13:26.244 --> 00:13:29.935
Because they achieved that state.

00:13:30.135 --> 00:13:38.664
Now all this is for your good, for your benevolence

00:13:38.864 --> 00:13:41.539
that you get all the blessings. But that doesn’t mean

00:13:41.739 --> 00:13:45.652
that you should stagnate, that you should not progress.

00:13:45.852 --> 00:13:49.550
One has to progress higher and higher.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.924
One has to decide the commitment: "I am committed to Sahaja Yoga",

00:13:55.125 --> 00:14:00.335
That is what you have to be, committed.

00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:03.460
May God bless you all.
