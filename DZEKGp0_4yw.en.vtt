“What Have You to Surrender?”
(aka “Being Connected to God”), Third Seminar Session,
January 24, 1982, Lonavala, Maharashtra, (India)

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:07.826
Before Realisation whatever you do,
as I told you, before this,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.760
is artificial, towards God,

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:12.504
because you are not connected.

00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:15.661
Any kind of worship you do, anything you do,

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:20.589
is not really reaching the principle of that.

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:23.412
Now, for example the flame:

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:26.445
the principle of flame is light.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.599
And unless until you are awakened,

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.966
you cannot awaken the principle,

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.796
you cannot touch the principle of flame.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.423
So, once you are awakened,

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:41.998
then, as you are on your principle,

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:47.496
you can go on the principle of the flame as well.

00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:51.520
After Realisation, when you start using the flame,

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:56.407
you must have seen that it gives soot,
black soot come out of it sometimes.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.304
I know of somebody who told me that

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.207
the whole wall became black
when he was putting hand towards me

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:06.416
and he was amazed how the wall became black!

00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:11.406
Then you have seen also that the flame reacts:

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.190
if my photograph is there

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:20.900
then you definitely awaken that flame,

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:23.508
because so many have been cured through my photograph.

00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:25.431
How it has happened?

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.409
What happens is that,

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:32.821
when my photograph is placed,

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.399
and you put the flame there,

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:37.332
the flame gets awakened,

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:45.492
and the light that passes through that flame
carries the vibrations over.

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:51.582
Material things carry [my vibrations], like sound.

00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:53.486
Now sound waves, you have seen that,

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.988
I get can clear you out
by touching my different chakras.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.409
Like today, I tried to clear you out
on your Hamsa, by touching this mic.

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.979
And on the Right Side there was a problem

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:10.715
so then I touched it to the right side.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.005
The vibrations were so much that
it was making a sound!

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.503
On the left side it was not.

00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:19.008
Then the problem of the fear on the Left Side
was just the other way around.

00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:22.904
So even sound carries the vibrations.

00:02:23.392 --> 00:02:24.554
For example, what is a mantra,

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:30.947
is nothing but a proper pocket, or you can say
a pot, which carries the vibrations.

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:33.824
But unless until you
are a realised-soul,

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:38.100
you cannot awaken the mantras.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:42.300
So to say mantras before the Realisation like mad
is wrong.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:49.193
Now doing trataka (त्राटक – fixing eyes on something)
with the photograph, is all right,

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.611
there’s nothing wrong,

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:54.990
but paying so much attention to one centre
is not necessary.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.710
Supposing there’s a photograph

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.706
and you are trying to look at the flame
in front of the photograph,

00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:13.323
then you are paying more attention to the flame
and not to the photograph.

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.792
On the contrary if you pay attention to the photograph,

00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:21.209
the flame puts the light to the photograph,

00:03:21.595 --> 00:03:23.643
and you get complete vibrations.

00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:31.198
Especially for people who suffer,
say, from the Right Side,

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:34.714
for them heat is not good so much,

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.360
because they are already heated up.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.190
To such people if they try
to take treatment from heat side,

00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:44.305
they won’t be helped.

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:51.008
They have to take vibrations from something
that is cold, like water and salt;

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:54.707
water and salt helps many people.

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.478
But some people it may not help also, possibly:

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:06.704
those who have temperament very, very sort
of, we can say, cold types of temperament,

00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:08.893
Left-Sided people.

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.004
It might not help those people.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.816
If they use a warm water it may help.

00:04:13.582 --> 00:04:17.594
So, [it] depends on
what sort of personality you are.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.014
For people who are very heated up:

00:04:20.273 --> 00:04:24.311
one should not take too hot water;
you should take cooler water.

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.953
The main thing is that,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.730
once you are Realised,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.302
then you can touch the principle of everything,
the tattwa, tattwa of everything.

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:42.009
Like if you have to treat the tree,

00:04:43.432 --> 00:04:50.899
you cannot treat individual petals
or individual leaves, even branches.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:53.709
But what you have to go into is the sap.

00:04:54.035 --> 00:04:55.969
And the sap is the principle.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.819
Now to get to the sap you have to use the water.

00:05:00.623 --> 00:05:04.853
So whatever medicine you have to give to the tree,

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:08.621
what you have to do is to mix it up in the water
[and] pour that water inside

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:19.078
so the water inside the sap sucks it
and manifests itself.

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:24.096
In the same way, when you are Realised
you become the principle.

00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:30.911
In the same way those people
who are supraconscious see colours;

00:05:31.488 --> 00:05:40.294
those who are subconscious they see other things,
like dead bodies, bhoots, this that.

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:48.906
Now if you are supraconscious

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.959
you see something [and] you think that is truth:

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.781
but you are in that area, that’s why you see.

00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:00.095
If you are in the subconscious
you see something that is the bhoot.

00:06:00.508 --> 00:06:07.099
But if you are in centre, in the present,
you see nothing, you just feel it.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.212
It is effective

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:13.199
because, in the centre,
you are on your principle.

00:06:15.307 --> 00:06:19.058
But you start seeing
the Kundalini is outside.

00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:26.609
Some people can even see in the sun’s rays,
you might see even, the vibrations.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.784
Many people can see vibrations

00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:34.517
because you have now jumped into your subtle being,

00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:36.542
you can see subtle things.

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:38.765
And when you use all these things:

00:06:38.977 --> 00:06:42.585
say, for example, “What is lemon and chilli?”
people might say,

00:06:42.733 --> 00:06:44.411
because those who do not understand;

00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:49.676
especially in the West where the mind is so much
conditioned by sophisticated things

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.917
that they can’t understand
what is [the] sense of putting lemon and chillies.

00:06:54.373 --> 00:06:56.306
Now lemon has a coefficience.

00:06:56.376 --> 00:07:00.627
Now you know that we have cured many people
with lemon and chillies, of their mental problems.

00:07:00.663 --> 00:07:02.008
We have seen it.

00:07:04.505 --> 00:07:10.706
So we have vibrated lemon and chillies,
and you have got and put them in the water.

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:16.269
Now what happens [is]
the lemon and chillies have a capacity,

00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.511
have a capacity, to suck my vibrations,

00:07:20.343 --> 00:07:25.410
or suck the vibrated water into themselves,
as vibrated ones.

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:30.884
They become vibrated themselves,
what is called as jagrut — they become awakened.

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:34.192
So in the night, when you open them,

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:37.110
the vibrations travel out

00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:47.983
and create an atmosphere
in which you start becoming one with your centre,

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:53.478
and you lose your left and right side movement

00:07:53.689 --> 00:08:00.838
and you become the sane one, you can say,

00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:03.470
because you have taken away from the left and right,

00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:05.679
and you come in the centre.

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:13.986
The question is whether the thing
has got vibrations or not, like this.

00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:19.095
What is vibrations?

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.161
Is the Brahma.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:27.003
Is the Divine Power of God,
is the Divine Power all around you.

00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:32.016
Now this Divine Power is in everything,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.848
but is not under your control, as yet;

00:08:36.387 --> 00:08:38.067
you have not touched it.

00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:41.020
Once you are awakened you touch it,

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:43.797
you awaken that in everything.

00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:45.700
Once you awaken that,

00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:47.914
then you start feeling the vibrations.

00:08:48.557 --> 00:08:53.667
Say I have stayed this house, in this place,
even on the seat,

00:08:54.445 --> 00:08:58.980
anybody who is sensitive Sahaja Yogi
will know where Mother has put (been).

00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:07.009
Certain things have greater capacity
to absorb vibrations.

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:14.010
This has been discovered in the ancient times
by many seers.

00:09:15.315 --> 00:09:21.310
All these techniques that we are using
are not necessarily all mine —

00:09:23.324 --> 00:09:28.615
they have been already seen by many ancient seers
who have seen it.

00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:44.712
So, you see, to understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:45.617
one has to know

00:09:45.714 --> 00:09:51.086
that there is a power, Divine Power,
which acts, which works out.

00:09:51.163 --> 00:09:54.572
And now you have become a medium of that power.

00:09:54.937 --> 00:09:57.801
That’s how now you have become samartha (समर्थ — powerful).

00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:04.601
Samartha also means strong, powerful, independent.

00:10:05.766 --> 00:10:09.821
But samartha also means ‘equal to your name’.

00:10:17.468 --> 00:10:20.323
So doing anything before Realisation is madness.

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.578
After Realisation also,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.202
paying attention to things
from where the vibration is coming, is better.

00:10:29.517 --> 00:10:32.113
Moreover, if your Agnya is broken

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.180
it’s better to avoid this,

00:10:34.965 --> 00:10:36.608
because you have already finished it,

00:10:36.978 --> 00:10:40.305
by doing over concentration at a point
where it was not needed.

00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:43.308
For example, supposing there is no door here

00:10:43.882 --> 00:10:46.149
and I am breaking it all the time,

00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:48.590
hitting it with my attention,

00:10:49.763 --> 00:10:51.017
the whole thing will collapse!

00:10:53.327 --> 00:10:54.687
The door is here.

00:10:55.702 --> 00:11:00.696
If you have paid attention in a place
where it doesn’t exist,

00:11:02.229 --> 00:11:04.763
you have not done justice to yourself.

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:07.710
It has to come out from here.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.014
And that is what, it said, that it is spoiled.

00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:16.853
It is very simple!

00:11:17.937 --> 00:11:19.705
In everyday life you see that way:

00:11:19.894 --> 00:11:23.492
a blind man, who doesn’t know the doorway out,

00:11:23.744 --> 00:11:25.424
can bang at any place,

00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:29.503
may break the wall,

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:31.095
may break himself also!

00:11:32.905 --> 00:11:38.298
So after Realisation and before Realisation
there’s a tremendous difference.

00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:43.303
One has to understand that
now you are a realised-soul.

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.917
This assumption you do not have yet.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.113
Surrender also, what do you surrender to me?

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:49.404
What do I want out of you?

00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:50.092
Nothing!

00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:53.107
What do you have to surrender to me?
I just don’t understand.

00:11:54.065 --> 00:11:56.786
Surrender you own ego, your own barriers.

00:11:57.703 --> 00:12:01.293
What you surrender is your own barrier,

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.411
so what is there to surrender?

00:12:05.716 --> 00:12:07.583
If you have your ego intact,

00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:09.894
you won’t work out Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:11.756
you will be insensitive.

00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:18.052
Supposing this thing is covered with some sort of cloth
and you cannot see,

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:20.305
then you remove the cloth from it,

00:12:20.712 --> 00:12:23.179
will you say it has been surrendered?

00:12:23.457 --> 00:12:25.627
This ‘surrender’ word itself is very treacherous

00:12:25.683 --> 00:12:27.817
because that immediately acts on your ego.

00:12:27.982 --> 00:12:30.293
Actually, surrender means surrender your ego.

00:12:30.462 --> 00:12:32.631
But when somebody says,
“You must surrender to Mataji!”

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:35.352
that means you think that
you have to surrender your money!

00:12:36.287 --> 00:12:38.704
What is there in money?
I don’t want your money.

00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:43.249
What is there to surrender to me?

00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:45.491
I mean just imagine!

00:12:45.614 --> 00:12:46.676
What are you going to give to me?

00:12:46.701 --> 00:12:48.419
I have nothing to get from you!

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.295
Is that there anything that I can get from you?

00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:52.523
Nothing!

00:12:53.275 --> 00:12:58.000
Luckily this time, even in this lifetime,

00:12:59.481 --> 00:13:04.500
I’m born in such way, in such family,
that I don’t need anything.

00:13:05.219 --> 00:13:10.817
I have even got paid and a position in that,
so even that I don’t need!

00:13:11.142 --> 00:13:13.112
What is there to surrender to me?

00:13:16.132 --> 00:13:20.196
You have to surrender your own ego, that’s all,

00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:24.996
and you will feel free with that,
because you are bound by your own ego.

00:13:25.402 --> 00:13:32.908
Supposing you are in the shackles of chains,
you are chained:

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:38.006
now if you want to remove the chains,
are you surrendering those chains?

00:13:38.916 --> 00:13:40.145
What you are surrendering

00:13:40.262 --> 00:13:49.089
is your own inhibitions, your own problems,
your own shackles,

00:13:50.554 --> 00:13:52.615
which do not give you freedom;

00:13:55.521 --> 00:14:01.408
your chains, your conditionings, your diseases, your troubles —

00:14:01.858 --> 00:14:03.406
that’s what you have surrendered.

00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:07.264
What is there to surrender?

00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:08.969
I just don’t understand.

00:14:09.513 --> 00:14:14.923
Just to remove the clouds
which are over your Spirit,

00:14:16.853 --> 00:14:21.601
you have to make Kundalini
rise with a great force

00:14:21.998 --> 00:14:24.101
so that they are all thrown away.

00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:30.409
I don’t know how you people have a misconception
that you must surrender to Mother.

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:31.369
What?

00:14:31.497 --> 00:14:37.012
Your negativity, your negative thinking,
all this must be surrendered.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:45.163
But I mean, imagine I having all your negativity,
all your burnings and all your heat.

00:14:45.188 --> 00:14:50.400
I mean, some people who touch my feet
really burn my feet, I tell you! Really! Horrible!

00:14:53.863 --> 00:14:56.700
It’s not easy to take everybody on my feet.

00:14:57.208 --> 00:15:00.463
I mean, even people who had leprosy,
who had this,

00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:01.474
they all touched my feet,

00:15:01.508 --> 00:15:03.498
the other day when I was in America.

00:15:03.984 --> 00:15:06.078
All kinds of people touched my feet.

00:15:06.713 --> 00:15:10.489
And they would think that,
“We are surrendering our leprosy to Mother!”

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.511
It is like that!

00:15:14.678 --> 00:15:19.862
For an ego-orientated person
it’s very easy to jump onto such conclusions.

00:15:20.307 --> 00:15:22.753
So you are surrendering nothing!

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.906
Whichever is valuable you cannot surrender.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.967
So, Indians, when they surrender,
they know what to do.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.374
But for a western mind
it is very difficult to understand surrendering.

00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:36.441
So far they have know gurus

00:15:36.536 --> 00:15:41.538
where they have surrendered their money, their wives, their children, everything!

00:15:43.092 --> 00:15:47.380
So they don’t understand
surrender in Sahja Yoga, what does it mean.

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:56.875
That means you have to become your principle
and give up all that is gross.

00:15:57.684 --> 00:15:59.502
But don’t give it to Guru!

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:02.212
Your gross should be thrown away.

00:16:02.505 --> 00:16:05.331
The Guru doesn’t want any gross from you, nothing.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:11.347
It is said, Buddha said it I think, they say so,
I don’t know if he would have said it

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:15.879
that, you must give all your tana, mana, dhana
(तना, body, मन mind, धन wealth) to your guru.

00:16:16.133 --> 00:16:20.170
I have said it at that time.

00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:23.118
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:23.293 --> 00:16:26.519
As I already told you,
you sacrifice nothing whatsoever.

00:16:26.868 --> 00:16:29.328
I mean on the contrary even on a material basis,

00:16:29.582 --> 00:16:38.123
say traveling in India, it’s the cheapest by Sahaja Yog —
cheaper by the dozen! (laughter)

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:40.721
It cannot cheaper than this.

00:16:41.372 --> 00:16:45.926
So, this is what one has to understand,
that you want to become the Spirit.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:52.762
And the Spirit means, the essence is that, you,
the principle that is you.

00:16:53.314 --> 00:16:56.313
You become the principle,
you touch every principle

00:16:56.401 --> 00:16:58.840
and that’s why everything has a meaning.

00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:03.317
Now in the book,
many people might have done that way,

00:17:04.122 --> 00:17:05.044
so they will not like it.

00:17:05.084 --> 00:17:06.600
If I tell them they will not like it.

00:17:06.703 --> 00:17:09.314
You see it’s a very funny reaction human beings have:

00:17:09.969 --> 00:17:11.319
if you are doing something wrong

00:17:11.682 --> 00:17:13.319
[and] if you tell them, “Don’t do it!”

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:22.251
then they will say that, “Why Mother said so?”

00:17:22.343 --> 00:17:23.648
I mean have to tell you!

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.196
After all you have come to me to ask the truth,

00:17:26.402 --> 00:17:28.088
so I have to tell you the truth.

00:17:29.065 --> 00:17:31.494
It is for your good only.

00:17:33.884 --> 00:17:37.487
Like yesterday I meet somebody
who was wearing three, four things in neck.

00:17:38.126 --> 00:17:40.054
He said, “I have high blood pressure.”

00:17:40.098 --> 00:17:43.114
I said, “All right.
For you a particular thing is all right.

00:17:43.223 --> 00:17:45.609
But all other things are no good.
You take it out!”

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.796
He said, “Yes, yes. I’ll take out everything you say
because I want get well.”

00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:56.511
This is what is. It’s so simple that
whatever is not good for you, I tell you.

00:17:57.178 --> 00:18:01.186
I am not here seeking elections,
that I should try to please you.

00:18:01.676 --> 00:18:11.698
I am here to comfort you, to help you,
and to give you counsel and to redeem you.

00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:16.599
How am I to do it when you come to tell me that,

00:18:16.874 --> 00:18:22.325
“This is wrong with a certain guru,
he has looted you, he has done this, that.”

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.301
That’s how I have come to know about gurus also.

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:28.551
But somebody’s still sticking onto that guru,

00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:30.548
when he comes to me, I tell that person that,

00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:34.539
“See, other people are saying about this,
you better be careful.”

00:18:35.193 --> 00:18:37.318
He feels very hurt!

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:41.576
And then when he’s hurt himself
later on with that guru,

00:18:41.814 --> 00:18:43.592
he comes back to me!

00:18:44.878 --> 00:18:49.490
My job is to warn you about all these people,
what they are doing.

00:18:53.457 --> 00:18:56.744
If there is a real guru,
I would say there is a real guru.

00:18:57.014 --> 00:18:59.851
But as I said, in Sahaj Yoga,
you don’t have to have any guru,

00:18:59.876 --> 00:19:02.276
because you your self becomes gurus.

00:19:02.638 --> 00:19:09.437
Gurus were required when we had to maintain our dharma,
when we had to maintain our balance.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.824
We needed it to tell us that,
“This is true, that is true.”

00:19:13.006 --> 00:19:15.765
In those days gurus are useless, absolutely useless.

00:19:16.607 --> 00:19:19.718
As it is gurus never treated with reverence, real gurus.

00:19:19.887 --> 00:19:21.186
They were never treated with reverence.

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:22.925
Nobody listened to them.

00:19:23.181 --> 00:19:29.444
They didn’t come to give you Realisation,
they came to establish you in your dharma.

00:19:30.141 --> 00:19:32.507
They didn’t have to give you Realisation at all.

00:19:32.662 --> 00:19:36.472
Like Guru Nanaka, whatever he said was the truth:

00:19:36.668 --> 00:19:41.020
just to establish you in dharma,
so that you get your Realisation later.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:44.881
But people make a cult out of that.

00:19:45.182 --> 00:19:48.421
Everything is made just [a cult] —
that’s not the thing.

00:19:48.658 --> 00:19:50.909
Guru is needed just to establish your dharma.

00:19:51.006 --> 00:19:53.330
But after Realisation you become the guru.

00:19:53.708 --> 00:20:00.556
That doesn’t mean you through disrespect in anyway to gurus
like Guru Nanaka and all this who are Sat Gurus.

00:20:01.418 --> 00:20:03.980
At their time, they were very much needed.

00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:10.088
If they were not there,
there would have no talk of principles of dharma.

00:20:10.434 --> 00:20:11.092
They were needed.

00:20:11.138 --> 00:20:15.738
Today you are Realised, you have become the guru.

00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:17.311
So you [should] talk of them also.

00:20:17.358 --> 00:20:21.518
But if you talk of them to anyone,
that person can go against you,

00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:26.994
if he is adharmic, he’ll not like if you tell him,
“Don’t do like this, don’t do like that!”

00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:29.609
It’s a very funny world.

00:20:30.587 --> 00:20:32.519
For Sahaj Yogis, you must understand that

00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:37.023
the task is very heavy and
you have to work it out with your discretion.

00:20:40.091 --> 00:20:42.091
If you want spread Sahaj Yoga,

00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:45.069
you have to be very, very careful with it,

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.797
because negativity is too much.

00:20:51.404 --> 00:20:54.070
And it is required that you should know,

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:57.301
how negativity works and acts on you.

00:20:58.624 --> 00:20:59.790
If there is any problem,

00:20:59.907 --> 00:21:03.488
you should let me know
what is the problem you have got or anything.

00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:08.325
But be direct and be simple about it.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.082
If you try to be cunning,
you will be the losers, isn’t it?

00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:15.615
So be direct.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:21.492
Tell me, “This is problem,”
and then try, and act [upon] what I say.

00:21:21.806 --> 00:21:25.835
It’s a free consultation given.

00:21:31.798 --> 00:21:39.775
So one has to assume, one has to believe
that you are realised-souls.

00:21:40.774 --> 00:21:42.518
This also when I say, people think that,

00:21:42.592 --> 00:21:46.078
“Mother is just forcing this idea into us!
It is auto-suggestion.”

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.098
Because I don’t know what to do sometimes.

00:21:50.899 --> 00:21:55.201
When they get Realisation,
they don’t want to believe they are realised-souls.

00:21:56.439 --> 00:21:59.419
Still they go on behaving in a way
as if they are not realised.

00:21:59.614 --> 00:22:01.491
Then I have to tell them, “You are realised-soul!”

00:22:01.673 --> 00:22:03.320
Now, know that you are realised-soul.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.986
Assume your powers as realised-souls.

00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:08.995
See if it acts or not or works it out or not.

00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:14.980
Once you have assumed that you are realised-soul,
immediately you will become responsible, I know that.

00:22:15.246 --> 00:22:25.996
But this assumption is very difficult:
that you are the essential of all the essences.

00:22:27.949 --> 00:22:32.484
If this is assumed within you,
I don’t have to tell you anything, I tell you,

00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:33.926
because once you know you are a guru,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.800
you will become responsible,

00:22:36.004 --> 00:22:38.616
you will see your own ego,
you will try to correct it.

00:22:38.865 --> 00:22:41.803
But if you come ask me,
I’ll have to tell you that,

00:22:41.908 --> 00:22:44.830
“This may be the reason.
That is the reason. [It’s] because of that.”

00:22:45.723 --> 00:22:48.623
I mean in Sahaj Yoga everything has a reason.

00:22:49.144 --> 00:22:50.900
But, of course, as you know,

00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:55.549
we allow very few people come in to the inner circle,
very few people.

00:22:55.705 --> 00:22:59.430
I mean, as it is
we don’t allow everybody come for puja,

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.391
because those who don’t understand, don’t understand.

00:23:02.796 --> 00:23:04.970
They jump back.

00:23:05.849 --> 00:23:09.617
Puja is more understood by Indians
than by the Western people also.

00:23:10.038 --> 00:23:17.209
But gradually, when they feel the effects of puja,
they want it, because it has an effect on them.

00:23:17.344 --> 00:23:18.709
It acts on you.

00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:23.404
Ninety-nine percent of people do feel,

00:23:23.927 --> 00:23:28.459
but one percent could be such that
they will act according to their egos.

00:23:28.524 --> 00:23:31.702
They may not accept anything, they react.

00:23:31.988 --> 00:23:33.912
So, in England we are very particular,

00:23:34.223 --> 00:23:36.289
but still some people creep in.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.118
Now questions and answers were very good.

00:23:43.368 --> 00:23:48.527
I liked the way they were asked, answers were given.

00:23:49.599 --> 00:23:55.695
But the best way to learn Sahaj yoga
is practical side of it — just like science.

00:23:56.824 --> 00:24:02.500
You must practice Sahaj Yoga:
practice on yourself and practice on others.

00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:04.865
And be a witness to it.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.703
These are the three things, if you do,

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:11.119
you will spread Sahaj Yoga better,

00:24:11.505 --> 00:24:13.902
you will grow better
and will understand Sahaj Yoga better.

00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:19.601
There are so many things that happen,
that cannot be explained.

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:23.892
For example, a gentleman came and told me,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:31.778
that, “The lady whom you have cured of cancer,
has now got pain in her kidneys.”

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:38.127
The moment he told, the lady felt better
and she got cured, that person.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.490
And she was not there, when he told me.

00:24:42.206 --> 00:24:44.006
Now, how it has worked out?

00:24:44.209 --> 00:24:45.138
How am I to explain this?

00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:46.193
It’s impossible!

00:24:46.227 --> 00:24:47.907
I cannot explain to you.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:53.384
Because human beings think that
everything is under their own understanding,
is a wrong thing.

00:24:53.478 --> 00:24:56.486
You can’t understand God and His ways. Can you?

00:24:57.158 --> 00:25:00.166
The only one thing one can do is to become one.

00:25:01.678 --> 00:25:05.115
Because you have a limited intellect.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.627
You can’t understand everything of Sahaj Yoga.

00:25:07.725 --> 00:25:11.211
You can’t understand how, under your hands,
the Kundalini is moving.

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:13.393
The how of nothing can be explained.

00:25:13.613 --> 00:25:19.032
That’s why I said, “Throw away ‘how’ in the sea!”
Because you cannot explain!

00:25:19.108 --> 00:25:24.366
Can you explain, why is it, when you raise the Kundalini,
it rises, and you can feel the chakras.

00:25:24.605 --> 00:25:28.559
Can you say how all of you feel the same centre?

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.985
In God’s realm it has so many dimensions.

00:25:44.188 --> 00:25:46.121
It has such tremendous speed.

00:25:48.178 --> 00:25:50.418
It is so effective.

00:25:50.863 --> 00:25:52.863
The attention is so effective.

00:25:53.606 --> 00:25:56.808
You bring something to the attention
and immediately it acts.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.804
And when she got cured, I went to her house,

00:26:03.303 --> 00:26:04.399
and I didn’t know what to do,

00:26:04.434 --> 00:26:08.820
because [it was] very embarrassing that I told.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.257
She said, “Why did I get it Mother?”

00:26:10.316 --> 00:26:14.888
I said, “You didn’t even write a letter of thanks to me.
At least a letter of thanks to God!”

00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:16.813
After all you must thank God.

00:26:16.994 --> 00:26:20.678
If you think that, “God has cured me so what?”
it’s not so.

00:26:24.286 --> 00:26:25.746
You have to be humble about it.

00:26:26.003 --> 00:26:28.896
At least a letter of thanks she should have sent to me.

00:26:29.227 --> 00:26:33.202
And that’s how she got out of my attention completely.

00:26:33.938 --> 00:26:35.972
I mean don’t do any harm to her,

00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:38.781
but she herself jumps into such things.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:44.627
And when she got out of my attention,
she got this trouble.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.961
Still she argued with me,

00:26:45.988 --> 00:26:51.279
“No, no. I didn’t want to write, because I was thinking
that I was cured by doctors.” this thing, that thing.

00:26:51.349 --> 00:26:53.513
I said, “All right, go ahead with it!”

00:26:53.906 --> 00:26:57.582
She wouldn’t even write a letter of thanks,
can you imagine!

00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:02.322
And then she got back her cancer.

00:27:03.059 --> 00:27:04.833
So a letter comes back to me,

00:27:04.968 --> 00:27:11.060
saying that, “Mother now she is writing
a letter of thanks to you.” (laughing)

00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:18.585
What am I to do? Isn’t it stupid?

00:27:20.452 --> 00:27:23.990
But it can be very serious!
It’s very stupid but very serious.

00:27:24.198 --> 00:27:28.721
You shouldn’t play with the Divine Power.
It’s very dangerous.

00:27:28.975 --> 00:27:33.539
Like one journalist, who
wrote something against me

00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:38.426
and people were very furious,
very, very furious with him.

00:27:38.586 --> 00:27:41.341
Everybody was angry with him,
I said, “Forget it!”

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.030
And now he’s got blood cancer.

00:27:44.834 --> 00:27:46.126
He sold his house.

00:27:46.163 --> 00:27:50.459
It was again published in the same newspaper
[that] he’s got blood cancer! (laughing).

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.738
I don’t know what to say!

00:27:51.791 --> 00:27:53.801
He’s sold his house.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:28:00.579
They told me that he sold his house and everything

00:28:00.841 --> 00:28:05.541
and he’s now going to America,
and his wife is now come to Sahaj Yoga.

00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:07.948
Why go that long way?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:13.009
If you forget God, God doesn’t forget you.

00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:16.132
But if you forget Him,

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:22.013
you get out of his attention,
and you go to something that is dangerous.

00:28:23.961 --> 00:28:27.532
You can see all this in Sahaja Yoga:

00:28:27.913 --> 00:28:31.684
those who have done like this,
gone out of the attention, have suffered.

00:28:31.863 --> 00:28:33.682
Not that God wants you to suffer,

00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:38.402
but, if there is light
you can see everything clearly.

00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:40.018
But when you go out of the light,

00:28:40.074 --> 00:28:43.078
you fall in a ditch, and you say,
“Why didn’t the light follow me?”

00:28:46.927 --> 00:28:50.526
It’s very stupid!
The whole thing is very stupid.

00:28:55.658 --> 00:28:56.991
When you surrender your ego,

00:28:57.092 --> 00:29:03.234
you realise that you are just
a part and parcel of the whole,

00:29:04.612 --> 00:29:07.226
and you are only are important
because you have become awakened;

00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:10.019
otherwise you are not important.

00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:27.695
All these things add up to a kind of a negativity
which gives you barrier to take Realisation.

00:29:28.944 --> 00:29:31.739
Take to your assumption
that you are a realised-soul.

00:29:35.065 --> 00:29:40.493
In a very simple way, now you have jumped in the sea,
that’s all — you have become the sea!

00:29:42.468 --> 00:29:50.306
What is there to give to Mother or to surrender —
[this is the] first point you should ask your Mr. Ego.

00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:54.276
“I myself is a problem to myself.”

00:29:55.344 --> 00:30:00.508
“If She is solving my problem,
She is taking up my problems to Herself,

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.596
what am I going to surrender to Her?”

00:30:06.061 --> 00:30:19.201
I mean you are so, sometimes, in the grip of the ego
that I don’t even try my tricks to test you,

00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:23.368
because you are so premature,
you are so sensitive still.

00:30:23.392 --> 00:30:25.459
I mean I don’t know what to do.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:29.808
You are to be tested, but even that I don’t do.

00:30:30.376 --> 00:30:32.120
No testing, direct.

00:30:34.715 --> 00:30:36.395
Some testing is needed.

00:30:37.237 --> 00:30:42.091
After all if you have to enter to the Kingdom of God,
you have to be tested, no doubt.

00:30:42.621 --> 00:30:47.496
You also know that, those who are realised,
that many centres you catch.

00:30:47.863 --> 00:30:53.627
You jump upon your ego and superego all the time,
you have problems, still doesn’t matter.

00:30:53.792 --> 00:30:59.603
Even if you have fifth-had car Sahaja Yoga accepts you.

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:10.182
Actually it Sahaja Yoga which is accepting all of you,
which is rendering all the help necessary.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:13.657
We have to be thankful to Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:14.162 --> 00:31:20.005
that it has brought such relief to all of us.
It’s such a relief.

00:31:20.315 --> 00:31:23.132
So one has to first assume
that you are realised-soul.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.804
That is the assumption you don’t have.

00:31:24.957 --> 00:31:27.466
And when you have that assumption
you think that you are realised-soul

00:31:27.522 --> 00:31:31.234
so you should shout at people,
and get angry and show off.

00:31:34.073 --> 00:31:36.915
Or you think you should extract money from Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:37.928 --> 00:31:49.814
you should try to take away sort of
like a businessman, something out of them.

00:31:50.213 --> 00:31:52.807
Or you should try to save money
at the cost of Sahaj Yoga.

00:31:52.855 --> 00:31:56.594
I mean this is absurd,
all these things are absurd.

00:31:58.309 --> 00:32:03.258
The absurdity is that you have come to gain something,

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.233
you have come to the River Ganges
to fill your pitchers — all right, fill it up.

00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:11.305
You fill up the water.

00:32:14.844 --> 00:32:19.492
But when you fill up the water,

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.302
you are going to use it for some purpose.

00:32:24.091 --> 00:32:27.572
Now, know that there is The Ganges within you.

00:32:27.952 --> 00:32:32.711
Assume it! Again and again I say to you,
that you assume it.

00:32:33.528 --> 00:32:38.847
The assumption will give you
whatever qualities are needed for the Spirit.

00:32:40.614 --> 00:32:45.862
You don’t need much of technique
as I told you this morning, not much of technique.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:55.151
What is needed is love, looking at things with love.

00:32:56.012 --> 00:32:57.310
If you are kind to someone,

00:32:57.449 --> 00:33:00.107
is it out of love or out of sympathy,

00:33:00.685 --> 00:33:06.167
or is it out of some sort of a power lust attitude,

00:33:06.238 --> 00:33:11.193
or is it out some sort of gain
that you want to get out of it.

00:33:11.812 --> 00:33:17.925
If your behaviour outside is artificial,
it is also of no use.

00:33:18.499 --> 00:33:20.211
So try to train yourself up that,

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:23.488
“Now I have come to Sahaj Yoga
I have to train myself!”

00:33:23.949 --> 00:33:25.929
It’s a very big training centre:

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:33.754
in you spiritual life, in your social life,
in your physical life, in your mental life.

00:33:34.453 --> 00:33:38.866
You have to cleanse your mind itself,
where the wrong things are coming from.

00:33:42.165 --> 00:33:46.005
You can cleanse
because your attention is now enlightened.

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:53.390
Just start looking at yourself,
“What kind of thought [is] there coming into my mind?”

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:58.826
And then once you have cleansed yourself

00:34:00.662 --> 00:34:03.696
you will feel your purity.
You will be very happy.

00:34:16.966 --> 00:34:20.803
Sahaja Yogis are my own children,

00:34:21.609 --> 00:34:24.244
they have got their own powers,

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:27.292
they have got it, because they have got it.

00:34:27.752 --> 00:34:29.701
Nobody need be jealous of them.

00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:31.510
Everybody can get it.

00:34:32.705 --> 00:34:35.134
God wants it to happen, it has happened.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.634
It is all prophesised that it is going to happen.

00:34:39.292 --> 00:34:43.709
But if you don’t understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga…

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.944
because if you judge from the gross angle
you cannot understand Sahaj Yoga.

00:34:50.615 --> 00:34:54.404
You have to know you have become a subtler being
and everything is on a subtle level;

00:34:54.694 --> 00:34:57.791
as I said in the morning only,
that you have become sukshma now.

00:34:58.024 --> 00:34:59.624
You have become now.

00:35:00.092 --> 00:35:02.723
You are different person.
You are not the same person.

00:35:03.024 --> 00:35:06.195
As the egg has become the bird,
it’s a different thing altogether.

00:35:06.552 --> 00:35:12.218
Take out all that was before — that,
if you call ‘surrender’, all right!

00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:19.412
and assume your own powers,
to become very powerful yourself.

00:35:31.286 --> 00:35:35.210
Now if there are any other questions
you ask me. Ask me.

00:35:40.226 --> 00:35:44.617
(In Marathi: You should all learn English.

00:35:45.028 --> 00:35:48.013
Your Mother has learned so you should also learn.

00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:50.785
Now the God understands English!

00:35:50.995 --> 00:35:55.309
I understand, that means that God understands!)

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.719
Yogis: Mother, can I ask a question.

00:35:58.822 --> 00:36:02.890
Today I was asked the following question
I didn’t know how to answer that.

00:36:03.679 --> 00:36:15.194
The person which usually feels very well in the fingers,
didn’t have ego finger burning, yet couldn’t surrender.

00:36:16.796 --> 00:36:26.006
So what is the position of not being capable of surrender,
fighting to surrender, yet the finger was not burning.

00:36:26.315 --> 00:36:30.100
Shri Mataji: The reason is stupidity,
is absolutely stupidity.

00:36:30.364 --> 00:36:31.796
I mean how can you explain this?

00:36:31.915 --> 00:36:35.818
You see, you are feeling the cool breeze in the hand,
you are feeling all right,

00:36:36.158 --> 00:36:37.859
still you are saying, “I am not going to surrender!”

00:36:37.938 --> 00:36:43.309
Must be some sort of a bull.
I mean you just see!

00:36:43.453 --> 00:36:45.108
How do you explain such a person?

00:36:45.285 --> 00:36:49.202
That person is not honest, [is] dishonest in simple words.

00:36:49.977 --> 00:36:53.716
Even if you are feeling the cool breeze
in the hand, you are feeling better,

00:36:53.843 --> 00:36:57.816
you are feeling the vibrations as promised by Adi Shankrachaya,

00:36:58.001 --> 00:37:02.276
everything you see, and also you
read Blake and you see all that,

00:37:02.406 --> 00:37:03.489
[and] still you don’t want to believe it,

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.091
that means you are stupid, you are just like a bull.

00:37:07.634 --> 00:37:14.063
Here a bull, is all right, healthy,
is perfectly in good condition

00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:18.510
and just sits on the street.

00:37:20.168 --> 00:37:22.811
And you ask him, “Why sir, why are you sitting on the street?”

00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:25.508
And he says, “I don’t want to surrender!”

00:37:25.871 --> 00:37:27.551
“Baba you are all right?

00:37:28.925 --> 00:37:29.807
What is matter with you?

00:37:29.924 --> 00:37:30.767
Why are you sitting here?”

00:37:31.167 --> 00:37:35.284
“No, I don’t want to surrender myself
to all the other traffic! I want sit here.”

00:37:36.938 --> 00:37:38.309
“But why?”

00:37:39.224 --> 00:37:44.905
Then there is a method (laughter).

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:52.386
For such stupid people there is method for that!

00:37:52.521 --> 00:37:55.609
And then they run! (laughter)

00:37:56.016 --> 00:37:57.219
This is absolute stupid!

00:37:57.311 --> 00:38:01.009
There’s nothing more than that
[which] can be said about a person like that!

00:38:01.131 --> 00:38:03.211
He doesn’t want to surrender, means what?

00:38:03.534 --> 00:38:06.116
What is he not wanting to do?

00:38:07.325 --> 00:38:10.108
I mean as surrender what do you do?
Just think about it.

00:38:10.356 --> 00:38:14.290
Then you tell them, you surrender, you surrender.
(break in recording)

00:38:14.483 --> 00:38:18.691
Such a person is possessed
and the possession comes back on the person.

00:38:19.148 --> 00:38:22.712
For a while it is all right
and then again there’s a possession which gives it ideas.

00:38:22.764 --> 00:38:24.017
Again it’s all right.

00:38:24.113 --> 00:38:26.117
It’s a wobbly character, that’s all we can say.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.895
It’s a very wobbly character.

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:32.135
And one should take oneself to task
for such a nonsensical thing.

00:38:32.903 --> 00:38:35.604
I mean, just think of it.

00:38:37.592 --> 00:38:42.010
Such behaviour is possible before Realisation.

00:38:42.373 --> 00:38:47.190
After Realisation, once you have felt something,
what is it?

00:38:50.643 --> 00:38:52.903
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity.

00:38:53.007 --> 00:38:55.177
Trying to show off, you can say, at the most.

00:38:55.361 --> 00:38:58.094
Such a person is just trying to show off,

00:38:58.472 --> 00:39:00.209
like a bull sitting on the street

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.054
is trying to show off,
“Every traffic is waiting for me!”

00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:06.512
He’s feeling very happy about it.

00:39:06.746 --> 00:39:07.905
It has a nuisance value.

00:39:08.607 --> 00:39:11.401
Such people are nothing but they are a nuisance value!

00:39:11.617 --> 00:39:14.496
They are nothing but a nuisance value.
They are a nuisance.

00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:21.404
By creating a nuisance, like in
England we have now these punk rocks —

00:39:21.689 --> 00:39:23.031
what do they achieve?

00:39:23.176 --> 00:39:28.614
Just create a disharmony,
a stupid feeling and a repulsion, that’s all.

00:39:29.492 --> 00:39:31.424
They just do it because, you see,

00:39:31.737 --> 00:39:35.077
if they feel they are neglected sometimes,
they do like this.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.719
Then they create a nuisance out of them[selves].

00:39:37.856 --> 00:39:40.756
So everybody pays attention to such a person.

00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:43.721
The best way is to neglect that!

00:39:44.228 --> 00:39:46.706
That is the best way is to neglect such people
who talk like this,

00:39:46.846 --> 00:39:51.280
then they will not have to surrender
and take two running jumps and go to hell!

00:39:53.817 --> 00:39:55.497
Then they are all right.

00:39:55.716 --> 00:39:57.649
Don’t fuss about such people.

00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:58.918
They are fussy people.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.238
They want to fuss about themselves.

00:40:00.302 --> 00:40:02.296
They want everybody to fuss about them.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.748
We should say, “You better spare Sahaj Yoga and us!”

00:40:09.602 --> 00:40:13.476
Yogi: Why the perfect God Mother,
this is a question they asked me, many people,

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:16.686
why the perfect God created the imperfect world

00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:22.012
and why so many people don’t have even the seeking
and they are going in the opposite direction?

00:40:23.282 --> 00:40:28.812
Shri Mataji: You ask the people.
(break in recording)

00:40:33.105 --> 00:40:36.506
Everyone! French should learn English!

00:40:37.216 --> 00:40:39.084
If you try to learn, it’s not difficult.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.931
If Indians can learn English why can’t you.

00:40:40.988 --> 00:40:42.918
Your Mother can’t speak French.

00:40:43.124 --> 00:40:44.191
It’s a very difficult language.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:52.214
You have to turn your tongue so much
that my Vishuddhi goes out of order.

00:40:53.535 --> 00:40:54.499
I can’t speak.

00:40:54.749 --> 00:40:57.220
I have tried to say your way,
but I just can’t say.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.830
I tried, you see.

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:04.108
So it’s better you learn English language.

00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:06.289
It’s not difficult for you.

00:41:07.103 --> 00:41:12.317
Most of the English words which are subtle
are borrowed from French!

00:41:13.742 --> 00:41:20.691
(Mother demonstrates a few words
similar between English and French)

00:41:28.318 --> 00:41:35.707
Now ‘Vincent’ everybody says, ‘Vincent’,
but you will say, ’Vanson’.

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:39.669
You see, this is individualism.

00:41:40.153 --> 00:41:41.728
Now we have become collective,

00:41:41.943 --> 00:41:45.207
try to learn a language which everyone understands.

00:41:46.033 --> 00:41:49.117
It’s not difficult
for French people to learn English words.

00:41:49.627 --> 00:41:53.213
Indians are very good at languages I tell you.

00:41:53.592 --> 00:41:55.659
They are the best in languages.

00:41:56.957 --> 00:42:01.757
If they want they can learn any language
so they should have no compunction.

00:42:02.535 --> 00:42:08.118
Should try to learn three languages,
as much as that you could follow me.

00:42:10.297 --> 00:42:17.902
Of course you can’t understand Hindi and Marathi so much
as you can understand English.

00:42:18.361 --> 00:42:20.203
So try at least.

00:42:20.544 --> 00:42:25.583
But that doesn’t mean that those who know English
should not know any other language!

00:42:25.805 --> 00:42:29.837
Like our Hindi speaking people,
they never try to learn any other language,

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.814
because everybody has to speak Hindi language.

00:42:34.844 --> 00:42:41.517
So those who are not well versed in other languages
should try to learn other languages.

00:42:41.758 --> 00:42:44.558
You must learn some language in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:45.238 --> 00:42:49.773
Say you may learn Sanskrit, you may learn Hindi, Marathi.

00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:53.615
If you know English,
that is not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:53.972 --> 00:42:56.505
You have to talk to other people also.

00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:02.485
If you really want to be effective
you have to know something.

00:43:05.173 --> 00:43:11.220
You will help me a lot if you know French,
because in France [when] I go, I get lost.

00:43:12.458 --> 00:43:13.901
In Spain [when] I go I get lost.

00:43:14.421 --> 00:43:20.889
We went to Spain and we had taken one lady with us
who was going to translate me

00:43:21.342 --> 00:43:26.291
and she got nervous
and I didn’t know how to talk to people.

00:43:26.728 --> 00:43:29.908
Then suddenly somebody came up
and he said, “I would like to translate you.”

00:43:36.924 --> 00:43:41.917
It is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis to do anything

00:43:42.496 --> 00:43:44.202
because they become so dynamic.

00:43:44.417 --> 00:43:46.024
If they get to it, they can do it.

00:43:46.268 --> 00:43:47.094
It’s very simple.

00:43:47.154 --> 00:43:51.803
So just think that you have to know
about other languages also,

00:43:52.065 --> 00:43:54.680
like Australians know only English, that’s not good.

00:43:54.917 --> 00:43:58.097
They must know one more language,
at least one more language.

00:43:58.522 --> 00:44:03.204
And for that they should try to get somebody
to teach them one more language.

00:44:03.964 --> 00:44:06.205
At least two languages you must know.

00:44:09.944 --> 00:44:12.672
I mean [if] you want to become
universal and stick onto one language,

00:44:12.743 --> 00:44:14.292
how will you become universal?

00:44:14.665 --> 00:44:17.465
Those who join maybe have to know English.

00:44:17.831 --> 00:44:19.837
Japanese also have to know English.

00:44:19.979 --> 00:44:24.497
I know this definitely, they have to know English,
because all naval terminologies are in English.

00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:31.397
Those who join airways, they have to know English
because everything is translated in English.

00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:43.362
Any other thing which is doing
a universal work or manifestation,

00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:46.601
they have to know English, it is important.

00:44:47.373 --> 00:44:48.988
So this will not be a waste.

00:44:49.228 --> 00:44:57.544
But in no way I would say that English language
is that perfect to describe Sahaja Yoga, in no way.

00:44:57.816 --> 00:45:01.415
But you have to know to understand anything.

00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:04.911
And we have to introduce new words also to explain.

00:45:05.054 --> 00:45:10.795
But for you people
it is important to know two languages.

00:45:11.218 --> 00:45:16.106
Either know Marathi and English or Hindi or English.

00:45:17.792 --> 00:45:22.288
But if it is easy and if you want to know,

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.408
you should know these three languages
if possible, little bit of it.

00:45:28.424 --> 00:45:33.998
Marathi is the most difficult,
but Hindi is not so difficult.

00:45:35.539 --> 00:45:37.708
Because we have to communicate.
We have to have a rapport.

00:45:38.061 --> 00:45:43.090
Or there is another language,
we can just sign — deaf and dumb language.

00:45:48.302 --> 00:45:49.765
You can try that.

00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:51.652
But it’s also complicated.

00:45:51.785 --> 00:45:54.652
You see, we had one deaf and dumb gentleman

00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:58.302
and for marriage he used to say like that, you see.

00:45:58.762 --> 00:46:01.010
So how will you know that marriage is this [sign].

00:46:01.122 --> 00:46:04.194
Because in marriage they put akshatas on people.

00:46:04.636 --> 00:46:08.376
So what he was [doing] was describing everything
according to his customs.

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:12.394
And in England people would not understand
what does that mean (laughter).

00:46:15.274 --> 00:46:19.165
They might think, ‘throwing stones’.

00:46:22.422 --> 00:46:26.191
Now those who have not used kumkum,
say for example, if you say this one.

00:46:26.632 --> 00:46:28.513
So that means the wife
according to (Indian sign language).

00:46:28.728 --> 00:46:30.661
Or mangala sutra he will say.

00:46:30.951 --> 00:46:33.598
And now those who never wear mangala sutra,
how will you know?

00:46:34.431 --> 00:46:41.717
So, you see, even deaf and dumb language is very much
affected by the locality or the place you live in.

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:45.497
All right, so let us decide
to know some other language also.

00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:48.211
What other question?
