“What Have You to Surrender?”
(aka “Being Connected to God”), Third Seminar Session,
January 24, 1982, Lonavala, Maharashtra, (India)

00:02.785 --> 00:07.826
Before Realisation whatever you do,
as I told you, before this,

00:08.025 --> 00:10.760
is artificial, towards God,

00:10.888 --> 00:12.504
because you are not connected.

00:12.761 --> 00:15.661
Any kind of worship you do, anything you do,

00:15.848 --> 00:20.589
is not really reaching the principle of that.

00:21.162 --> 00:23.412
Now, for example the flame:

00:23.777 --> 00:26.445
the principle of flame is light.

00:27.633 --> 00:29.599
And unless until you are awakened,

00:29.833 --> 00:31.966
you cannot awaken the principle,

00:33.129 --> 00:35.796
you cannot touch the principle of flame.

00:36.690 --> 00:38.423
So, once you are awakened,

00:38.862 --> 00:41.998
then, as you are on your principle,

00:42.723 --> 00:47.496
you can go on the principle of the flame as well.

00:48.486 --> 00:51.520
After Realisation, when you start using the flame,

00:51.689 --> 00:56.407
you must have seen that it gives soot,
black soot come out of it sometimes.

00:56.946 --> 00:59.304
I know of somebody who told me that

01:00.182 --> 01:03.207
the whole wall became black
when he was putting hand towards me

01:03.516 --> 01:06.416
and he was amazed how the wall became black!

01:06.931 --> 01:11.406
Then you have seen also that the flame reacts:

01:13.180 --> 01:15.190
if my photograph is there

01:15.333 --> 01:20.900
then you definitely awaken that flame,

01:21.096 --> 01:23.508
because so many have been cured through my photograph.

01:24.074 --> 01:25.431
How it has happened?

01:28.241 --> 01:29.409
What happens is that,

01:29.434 --> 01:32.821
when my photograph is placed,

01:32.954 --> 01:35.399
and you put the flame there,

01:35.652 --> 01:37.332
the flame gets awakened,

01:37.585 --> 01:45.492
and the light that passes through that flame
carries the vibrations over.

01:46.332 --> 01:51.582
Material things carry [my vibrations], like sound.

01:51.724 --> 01:53.486
Now sound waves, you have seen that,

01:53.719 --> 01:58.988
I get can clear you out
by touching my different chakras.

01:59.470 --> 02:06.409
Like today, I tried to clear you out
on your Hamsa, by touching this mic.

02:06.795 --> 02:08.979
And on the Right Side there was a problem

02:09.182 --> 02:10.715
so then I touched it to the right side.

02:10.979 --> 02:13.005
The vibrations were so much that
it was making a sound!

02:13.099 --> 02:14.503
On the left side it was not.

02:14.848 --> 02:19.008
Then the problem of the fear on the Left Side
was just the other way around.

02:19.241 --> 02:22.904
So even sound carries the vibrations.

02:23.392 --> 02:24.554
For example, what is a mantra,

02:24.612 --> 02:30.947
is nothing but a proper pocket, or you can say
a pot, which carries the vibrations.

02:31.302 --> 02:33.824
But unless until you
are a realised-soul,

02:33.929 --> 02:38.100
you cannot awaken the mantras.

02:38.622 --> 02:42.300
So to say mantras before the Realisation like mad
is wrong.

02:43.125 --> 02:49.193
Now doing trataka (त्राटक – fixing eyes on something)
with the photograph, is all right,

02:49.252 --> 02:50.611
there’s nothing wrong,

02:51.077 --> 02:54.990
but paying so much attention to one centre
is not necessary.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.710
Supposing there’s a photograph

03:02.959 --> 03:08.706
and you are trying to look at the flame
in front of the photograph,

03:09.531 --> 03:13.323
then you are paying more attention to the flame
and not to the photograph.

03:13.923 --> 03:16.792
On the contrary if you pay attention to the photograph,

03:17.083 --> 03:21.209
the flame puts the light to the photograph,

03:21.595 --> 03:23.643
and you get complete vibrations.

03:25.462 --> 03:31.198
Especially for people who suffer,
say, from the Right Side,

03:31.563 --> 03:34.714
for them heat is not good so much,

03:35.595 --> 03:37.360
because they are already heated up.

03:38.310 --> 03:42.190
To such people if they try
to take treatment from heat side,

03:42.264 --> 03:44.305
they won’t be helped.

03:45.075 --> 03:51.008
They have to take vibrations from something
that is cold, like water and salt;

03:52.275 --> 03:54.707
water and salt helps many people.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.478
But some people it may not help also, possibly:

03:58.676 --> 04:06.704
those who have temperament very, very sort
of, we can say, cold types of temperament,

04:07.525 --> 04:08.893
Left-Sided people.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.004
It might not help those people.

04:10.110 --> 04:11.816
If they use a warm water it may help.

04:13.582 --> 04:17.594
So, [it] depends on
what sort of personality you are.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.014
For people who are very heated up:

04:20.273 --> 04:24.311
one should not take too hot water;
you should take cooler water.

04:28.389 --> 04:29.953
The main thing is that,

04:30.050 --> 04:31.730
once you are Realised,

04:32.570 --> 04:38.302
then you can touch the principle of everything,
the tattwa, tattwa of everything.

04:39.286 --> 04:42.009
Like if you have to treat the tree,

04:43.432 --> 04:50.899
you cannot treat individual petals
or individual leaves, even branches.

04:51.135 --> 04:53.709
But what you have to go into is the sap.

04:54.035 --> 04:55.969
And the sap is the principle.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.819
Now to get to the sap you have to use the water.

05:00.623 --> 05:04.853
So whatever medicine you have to give to the tree,

05:04.895 --> 05:08.621
what you have to do is to mix it up in the water
[and] pour that water inside

05:08.991 --> 05:19.078
so the water inside the sap sucks it
and manifests itself.

05:19.565 --> 05:24.096
In the same way, when you are Realised
you become the principle.

05:25.572 --> 05:30.911
In the same way those people
who are supraconscious see colours;

05:31.488 --> 05:40.294
those who are subconscious they see other things,
like dead bodies, bhoots, this that.

05:45.844 --> 05:48.906
Now if you are supraconscious

05:50.799 --> 05:52.959
you see something [and] you think that is truth:

05:53.319 --> 05:55.781
but you are in that area, that’s why you see.

05:56.739 --> 06:00.095
If you are in the subconscious
you see something that is the bhoot.

06:00.508 --> 06:07.099
But if you are in centre, in the present,
you see nothing, you just feel it.

06:07.639 --> 06:09.212
It is effective

06:10.516 --> 06:13.199
because, in the centre,
you are on your principle.

06:15.307 --> 06:19.058
But you start seeing
the Kundalini is outside.

06:20.011 --> 06:26.609
Some people can even see in the sun’s rays,
you might see even, the vibrations.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.784
Many people can see vibrations

06:31.353 --> 06:34.517
because you have now jumped into your subtle being,

06:34.652 --> 06:36.542
you can see subtle things.

06:37.478 --> 06:38.765
And when you use all these things:

06:38.977 --> 06:42.585
say, for example, “What is lemon and chilli?”
people might say,

06:42.733 --> 06:44.411
because those who do not understand;

06:44.533 --> 06:49.676
especially in the West where the mind is so much
conditioned by sophisticated things

06:49.701 --> 06:53.917
that they can’t understand
what is [the] sense of putting lemon and chillies.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.306
Now lemon has a coefficience.

06:56.376 --> 07:00.627
Now you know that we have cured many people
with lemon and chillies, of their mental problems.

07:00.663 --> 07:02.008
We have seen it.

07:04.505 --> 07:10.706
So we have vibrated lemon and chillies,
and you have got and put them in the water.

07:12.429 --> 07:16.269
Now what happens [is]
the lemon and chillies have a capacity,

07:16.911 --> 07:19.511
have a capacity, to suck my vibrations,

07:20.343 --> 07:25.410
or suck the vibrated water into themselves,
as vibrated ones.

07:25.669 --> 07:30.884
They become vibrated themselves,
what is called as jagrut — they become awakened.

07:31.889 --> 07:34.192
So in the night, when you open them,

07:34.933 --> 07:37.110
the vibrations travel out

07:37.991 --> 07:47.983
and create an atmosphere
in which you start becoming one with your centre,

07:48.779 --> 07:53.478
and you lose your left and right side movement

07:53.689 --> 08:00.838
and you become the sane one, you can say,

08:01.126 --> 08:03.470
because you have taken away from the left and right,

08:03.724 --> 08:05.679
and you come in the centre.

08:08.768 --> 08:13.986
The question is whether the thing
has got vibrations or not, like this.

08:18.203 --> 08:19.095
What is vibrations?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.161
Is the Brahma.

08:23.169 --> 08:27.003
Is the Divine Power of God,
is the Divine Power all around you.

08:27.321 --> 08:32.016
Now this Divine Power is in everything,

08:33.450 --> 08:35.848
but is not under your control, as yet;

08:36.387 --> 08:38.067
you have not touched it.

08:38.806 --> 08:41.020
Once you are awakened you touch it,

08:41.634 --> 08:43.797
you awaken that in everything.

08:44.427 --> 08:45.700
Once you awaken that,

08:45.827 --> 08:47.914
then you start feeling the vibrations.

08:48.557 --> 08:53.667
Say I have stayed this house, in this place,
even on the seat,

08:54.445 --> 08:58.980
anybody who is sensitive Sahaja Yogi
will know where Mother has put (been).

09:01.448 --> 09:07.009
Certain things have greater capacity
to absorb vibrations.

09:07.943 --> 09:14.010
This has been discovered in the ancient times
by many seers.

09:15.315 --> 09:21.310
All these techniques that we are using
are not necessarily all mine —

09:23.324 --> 09:28.615
they have been already seen by many ancient seers
who have seen it.

09:41.423 --> 09:44.712
So, you see, to understand Sahaja Yoga,

09:44.789 --> 09:45.617
one has to know

09:45.714 --> 09:51.086
that there is a power, Divine Power,
which acts, which works out.

09:51.163 --> 09:54.572
And now you have become a medium of that power.

09:54.937 --> 09:57.801
That’s how now you have become samartha (समर्थ — powerful).

09:59.343 --> 10:04.601
Samartha also means strong, powerful, independent.

10:05.766 --> 10:09.821
But samartha also means ‘equal to your name’.

10:17.468 --> 10:20.323
So doing anything before Realisation is madness.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.578
After Realisation also,

10:23.620 --> 10:27.202
paying attention to things
from where the vibration is coming, is better.

10:29.517 --> 10:32.113
Moreover, if your Agnya is broken

10:32.240 --> 10:34.180
it’s better to avoid this,

10:34.965 --> 10:36.608
because you have already finished it,

10:36.978 --> 10:40.305
by doing over concentration at a point
where it was not needed.

10:40.408 --> 10:43.308
For example, supposing there is no door here

10:43.882 --> 10:46.149
and I am breaking it all the time,

10:47.241 --> 10:48.590
hitting it with my attention,

10:49.763 --> 10:51.017
the whole thing will collapse!

10:53.327 --> 10:54.687
The door is here.

10:55.702 --> 11:00.696
If you have paid attention in a place
where it doesn’t exist,

11:02.229 --> 11:04.763
you have not done justice to yourself.

11:05.352 --> 11:07.710
It has to come out from here.

11:11.350 --> 11:15.014
And that is what, it said, that it is spoiled.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.853
It is very simple!

11:17.937 --> 11:19.705
In everyday life you see that way:

11:19.894 --> 11:23.492
a blind man, who doesn’t know the doorway out,

11:23.744 --> 11:25.424
can bang at any place,

11:28.088 --> 11:29.503
may break the wall,

11:29.668 --> 11:31.095
may break himself also!

11:32.905 --> 11:38.298
So after Realisation and before Realisation
there’s a tremendous difference.

11:38.558 --> 11:43.303
One has to understand that
now you are a realised-soul.

11:44.039 --> 11:45.917
This assumption you do not have yet.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.113
Surrender also, what do you surrender to me?

11:48.259 --> 11:49.404
What do I want out of you?

11:49.451 --> 11:50.092
Nothing!

11:50.208 --> 11:53.107
What do you have to surrender to me?
I just don’t understand.

11:54.065 --> 11:56.786
Surrender you own ego, your own barriers.

11:57.703 --> 12:01.293
What you surrender is your own barrier,

12:03.756 --> 12:05.411
so what is there to surrender?

12:05.716 --> 12:07.583
If you have your ego intact,

12:08.363 --> 12:09.894
you won’t work out Sahaja Yoga,

12:10.076 --> 12:11.756
you will be insensitive.

12:12.239 --> 12:18.052
Supposing this thing is covered with some sort of cloth
and you cannot see,

12:18.299 --> 12:20.305
then you remove the cloth from it,

12:20.712 --> 12:23.179
will you say it has been surrendered?

12:23.457 --> 12:25.627
This ‘surrender’ word itself is very treacherous

12:25.683 --> 12:27.817
because that immediately acts on your ego.

12:27.982 --> 12:30.293
Actually, surrender means surrender your ego.

12:30.462 --> 12:32.631
But when somebody says,
“You must surrender to Mataji!”

12:32.669 --> 12:35.352
that means you think that
you have to surrender your money!

12:36.287 --> 12:38.704
What is there in money?
I don’t want your money.

12:41.049 --> 12:43.249
What is there to surrender to me?

12:44.155 --> 12:45.491
I mean just imagine!

12:45.614 --> 12:46.676
What are you going to give to me?

12:46.701 --> 12:48.419
I have nothing to get from you!

12:49.300 --> 12:51.295
Is that there anything that I can get from you?

12:51.523 --> 12:52.523
Nothing!

12:53.275 --> 12:58.000
Luckily this time, even in this lifetime,

12:59.481 --> 13:04.500
I’m born in such way, in such family,
that I don’t need anything.

13:05.219 --> 13:10.817
I have even got paid and a position in that,
so even that I don’t need!

13:11.142 --> 13:13.112
What is there to surrender to me?

13:16.132 --> 13:20.196
You have to surrender your own ego, that’s all,

13:21.149 --> 13:24.996
and you will feel free with that,
because you are bound by your own ego.

13:25.402 --> 13:32.908
Supposing you are in the shackles of chains,
you are chained:

13:33.779 --> 13:38.006
now if you want to remove the chains,
are you surrendering those chains?

13:38.916 --> 13:40.145
What you are surrendering

13:40.262 --> 13:49.089
is your own inhibitions, your own problems,
your own shackles,

13:50.554 --> 13:52.615
which do not give you freedom;

13:55.521 --> 14:01.408
your chains, your conditionings, your diseases, your troubles —

14:01.858 --> 14:03.406
that’s what you have surrendered.

14:06.004 --> 14:07.264
What is there to surrender?

14:07.312 --> 14:08.969
I just don’t understand.

14:09.513 --> 14:14.923
Just to remove the clouds
which are over your Spirit,

14:16.853 --> 14:21.601
you have to make Kundalini
rise with a great force

14:21.998 --> 14:24.101
so that they are all thrown away.

14:25.439 --> 14:30.409
I don’t know how you people have a misconception
that you must surrender to Mother.

14:30.579 --> 14:31.369
What?

14:31.497 --> 14:37.012
Your negativity, your negative thinking,
all this must be surrendered.

14:37.430 --> 14:45.163
But I mean, imagine I having all your negativity,
all your burnings and all your heat.

14:45.188 --> 14:50.400
I mean, some people who touch my feet
really burn my feet, I tell you! Really! Horrible!

14:53.863 --> 14:56.700
It’s not easy to take everybody on my feet.

14:57.208 --> 15:00.463
I mean, even people who had leprosy,
who had this,

15:00.567 --> 15:01.474
they all touched my feet,

15:01.508 --> 15:03.498
the other day when I was in America.

15:03.984 --> 15:06.078
All kinds of people touched my feet.

15:06.713 --> 15:10.489
And they would think that,
“We are surrendering our leprosy to Mother!”

15:13.019 --> 15:14.511
It is like that!

15:14.678 --> 15:19.862
For an ego-orientated person
it’s very easy to jump onto such conclusions.

15:20.307 --> 15:22.753
So you are surrendering nothing!

15:23.040 --> 15:25.906
Whichever is valuable you cannot surrender.

15:28.150 --> 15:30.967
So, Indians, when they surrender,
they know what to do.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.374
But for a western mind
it is very difficult to understand surrendering.

15:35.051 --> 15:36.441
So far they have know gurus

15:36.536 --> 15:41.538
where they have surrendered their money, their wives, their children, everything!

15:43.092 --> 15:47.380
So they don’t understand
surrender in Sahja Yoga, what does it mean.

15:52.139 --> 15:56.875
That means you have to become your principle
and give up all that is gross.

15:57.684 --> 15:59.502
But don’t give it to Guru!

15:59.668 --> 16:02.212
Your gross should be thrown away.

16:02.505 --> 16:05.331
The Guru doesn’t want any gross from you, nothing.

16:05.680 --> 16:11.347
It is said, Buddha said it I think, they say so,
I don’t know if he would have said it

16:11.458 --> 16:15.879
that, you must give all your tana, mana, dhana
(तना, body, मन mind, धन wealth) to your guru.

16:16.133 --> 16:20.170
I have said it at that time.

16:21.122 --> 16:23.118
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

16:23.293 --> 16:26.519
As I already told you,
you sacrifice nothing whatsoever.

16:26.868 --> 16:29.328
I mean on the contrary even on a material basis,

16:29.582 --> 16:38.123
say traveling in India, it’s the cheapest by Sahaja Yog —
cheaper by the dozen! (laughter)

16:38.564 --> 16:40.721
It cannot cheaper than this.

16:41.372 --> 16:45.926
So, this is what one has to understand,
that you want to become the Spirit.

16:46.150 --> 16:52.762
And the Spirit means, the essence is that, you,
the principle that is you.

16:53.314 --> 16:56.313
You become the principle,
you touch every principle

16:56.401 --> 16:58.840
and that’s why everything has a meaning.

16:59.099 --> 17:03.317
Now in the book,
many people might have done that way,

17:04.122 --> 17:05.044
so they will not like it.

17:05.084 --> 17:06.600
If I tell them they will not like it.

17:06.703 --> 17:09.314
You see it’s a very funny reaction human beings have:

17:09.969 --> 17:11.319
if you are doing something wrong

17:11.682 --> 17:13.319
[and] if you tell them, “Don’t do it!”

17:15.450 --> 17:22.251
then they will say that, “Why Mother said so?”

17:22.343 --> 17:23.648
I mean have to tell you!

17:23.751 --> 17:26.196
After all you have come to me to ask the truth,

17:26.402 --> 17:28.088
so I have to tell you the truth.

17:29.065 --> 17:31.494
It is for your good only.

17:33.884 --> 17:37.487
Like yesterday I meet somebody
who was wearing three, four things in neck.

17:38.126 --> 17:40.054
He said, “I have high blood pressure.”

17:40.098 --> 17:43.114
I said, “All right.
For you a particular thing is all right.

17:43.223 --> 17:45.609
But all other things are no good.
You take it out!”

17:46.030 --> 17:48.796
He said, “Yes, yes. I’ll take out everything you say
because I want get well.”

17:49.042 --> 17:56.511
This is what is. It’s so simple that
whatever is not good for you, I tell you.

17:57.178 --> 18:01.186
I am not here seeking elections,
that I should try to please you.

18:01.676 --> 18:11.698
I am here to comfort you, to help you,
and to give you counsel and to redeem you.

18:11.971 --> 18:16.599
How am I to do it when you come to tell me that,

18:16.874 --> 18:22.325
“This is wrong with a certain guru,
he has looted you, he has done this, that.”

18:23.580 --> 18:26.301
That’s how I have come to know about gurus also.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.551
But somebody’s still sticking onto that guru,

18:28.689 --> 18:30.548
when he comes to me, I tell that person that,

18:30.715 --> 18:34.539
“See, other people are saying about this,
you better be careful.”

18:35.193 --> 18:37.318
He feels very hurt!

18:38.055 --> 18:41.576
And then when he’s hurt himself
later on with that guru,

18:41.814 --> 18:43.592
he comes back to me!

18:44.878 --> 18:49.490
My job is to warn you about all these people,
what they are doing.

18:53.457 --> 18:56.744
If there is a real guru,
I would say there is a real guru.

18:57.014 --> 18:59.851
But as I said, in Sahaj Yoga,
you don’t have to have any guru,

18:59.876 --> 19:02.276
because you your self becomes gurus.

19:02.638 --> 19:09.437
Gurus were required when we had to maintain our dharma,
when we had to maintain our balance.

19:09.790 --> 19:12.824
We needed it to tell us that,
“This is true, that is true.”

19:13.006 --> 19:15.765
In those days gurus are useless, absolutely useless.

19:16.607 --> 19:19.718
As it is gurus never treated with reverence, real gurus.

19:19.887 --> 19:21.186
They were never treated with reverence.

19:21.245 --> 19:22.925
Nobody listened to them.

19:23.181 --> 19:29.444
They didn’t come to give you Realisation,
they came to establish you in your dharma.

19:30.141 --> 19:32.507
They didn’t have to give you Realisation at all.

19:32.662 --> 19:36.472
Like Guru Nanaka, whatever he said was the truth:

19:36.668 --> 19:41.020
just to establish you in dharma,
so that you get your Realisation later.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.881
But people make a cult out of that.

19:45.182 --> 19:48.421
Everything is made just [a cult] —
that’s not the thing.

19:48.658 --> 19:50.909
Guru is needed just to establish your dharma.

19:51.006 --> 19:53.330
But after Realisation you become the guru.

19:53.708 --> 20:00.556
That doesn’t mean you through disrespect in anyway to gurus
like Guru Nanaka and all this who are Sat Gurus.

20:01.418 --> 20:03.980
At their time, they were very much needed.

20:04.807 --> 20:10.088
If they were not there,
there would have no talk of principles of dharma.

20:10.434 --> 20:11.092
They were needed.

20:11.138 --> 20:15.738
Today you are Realised, you have become the guru.

20:16.107 --> 20:17.311
So you [should] talk of them also.

20:17.358 --> 20:21.518
But if you talk of them to anyone,
that person can go against you,

20:22.775 --> 20:26.994
if he is adharmic, he’ll not like if you tell him,
“Don’t do like this, don’t do like that!”

20:27.391 --> 20:29.609
It’s a very funny world.

20:30.587 --> 20:32.519
For Sahaj Yogis, you must understand that

20:32.551 --> 20:37.023
the task is very heavy and
you have to work it out with your discretion.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.091
If you want spread Sahaj Yoga,

20:42.269 --> 20:45.069
you have to be very, very careful with it,

20:48.730 --> 20:50.797
because negativity is too much.

20:51.404 --> 20:54.070
And it is required that you should know,

20:54.386 --> 20:57.301
how negativity works and acts on you.

20:58.624 --> 20:59.790
If there is any problem,

20:59.907 --> 21:03.488
you should let me know
what is the problem you have got or anything.

21:03.671 --> 21:08.325
But be direct and be simple about it.

21:09.370 --> 21:13.082
If you try to be cunning,
you will be the losers, isn’t it?

21:14.316 --> 21:15.615
So be direct.

21:15.930 --> 21:21.492
Tell me, “This is problem,”
and then try, and act [upon] what I say.

21:21.806 --> 21:25.835
It’s a free consultation given.

21:31.798 --> 21:39.775
So one has to assume, one has to believe
that you are realised-souls.

21:40.774 --> 21:42.518
This also when I say, people think that,

21:42.592 --> 21:46.078
“Mother is just forcing this idea into us!
It is auto-suggestion.”

21:46.990 --> 21:50.098
Because I don’t know what to do sometimes.

21:50.899 --> 21:55.201
When they get Realisation,
they don’t want to believe they are realised-souls.

21:56.439 --> 21:59.419
Still they go on behaving in a way
as if they are not realised.

21:59.614 --> 22:01.491
Then I have to tell them, “You are realised-soul!”

22:01.673 --> 22:03.320
Now, know that you are realised-soul.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.986
Assume your powers as realised-souls.

22:06.371 --> 22:08.995
See if it acts or not or works it out or not.

22:09.521 --> 22:14.980
Once you have assumed that you are realised-soul,
immediately you will become responsible, I know that.

22:15.246 --> 22:25.996
But this assumption is very difficult:
that you are the essential of all the essences.

22:27.949 --> 22:32.484
If this is assumed within you,
I don’t have to tell you anything, I tell you,

22:32.711 --> 22:33.926
because once you know you are a guru,

22:34.020 --> 22:35.800
you will become responsible,

22:36.004 --> 22:38.616
you will see your own ego,
you will try to correct it.

22:38.865 --> 22:41.803
But if you come ask me,
I’ll have to tell you that,

22:41.908 --> 22:44.830
“This may be the reason.
That is the reason. [It’s] because of that.”

22:45.723 --> 22:48.623
I mean in Sahaj Yoga everything has a reason.

22:49.144 --> 22:50.900
But, of course, as you know,

22:51.133 --> 22:55.549
we allow very few people come in to the inner circle,
very few people.

22:55.705 --> 22:59.430
I mean, as it is
we don’t allow everybody come for puja,

22:59.540 --> 23:02.391
because those who don’t understand, don’t understand.

23:02.796 --> 23:04.970
They jump back.

23:05.849 --> 23:09.617
Puja is more understood by Indians
than by the Western people also.

23:10.038 --> 23:17.209
But gradually, when they feel the effects of puja,
they want it, because it has an effect on them.

23:17.344 --> 23:18.709
It acts on you.

23:18.819 --> 23:23.404
Ninety-nine percent of people do feel,

23:23.927 --> 23:28.459
but one percent could be such that
they will act according to their egos.

23:28.524 --> 23:31.702
They may not accept anything, they react.

23:31.988 --> 23:33.912
So, in England we are very particular,

23:34.223 --> 23:36.289
but still some people creep in.

23:39.630 --> 23:43.118
Now questions and answers were very good.

23:43.368 --> 23:48.527
I liked the way they were asked, answers were given.

23:49.599 --> 23:55.695
But the best way to learn Sahaj yoga
is practical side of it — just like science.

23:56.824 --> 24:02.500
You must practice Sahaj Yoga:
practice on yourself and practice on others.

24:03.185 --> 24:04.865
And be a witness to it.

24:05.170 --> 24:07.703
These are the three things, if you do,

24:09.178 --> 24:11.119
you will spread Sahaj Yoga better,

24:11.505 --> 24:13.902
you will grow better
and will understand Sahaj Yoga better.

24:14.182 --> 24:19.601
There are so many things that happen,
that cannot be explained.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.892
For example, a gentleman came and told me,

24:24.310 --> 24:31.778
that, “The lady whom you have cured of cancer,
has now got pain in her kidneys.”

24:33.170 --> 24:38.127
The moment he told, the lady felt better
and she got cured, that person.

24:38.270 --> 24:41.490
And she was not there, when he told me.

24:42.206 --> 24:44.006
Now, how it has worked out?

24:44.209 --> 24:45.138
How am I to explain this?

24:45.233 --> 24:46.193
It’s impossible!

24:46.227 --> 24:47.907
I cannot explain to you.

24:48.260 --> 24:53.384
Because human beings think that
everything is under their own understanding,
is a wrong thing.

24:53.478 --> 24:56.486
You can’t understand God and His ways. Can you?

24:57.158 --> 25:00.166
The only one thing one can do is to become one.

25:01.678 --> 25:05.115
Because you have a limited intellect.

25:05.490 --> 25:07.627
You can’t understand everything of Sahaj Yoga.

25:07.725 --> 25:11.211
You can’t understand how, under your hands,
the Kundalini is moving.

25:11.549 --> 25:13.393
The how of nothing can be explained.

25:13.613 --> 25:19.032
That’s why I said, “Throw away ‘how’ in the sea!”
Because you cannot explain!

25:19.108 --> 25:24.366
Can you explain, why is it, when you raise the Kundalini,
it rises, and you can feel the chakras.

25:24.605 --> 25:28.559
Can you say how all of you feel the same centre?

25:37.600 --> 25:42.985
In God’s realm it has so many dimensions.

25:44.188 --> 25:46.121
It has such tremendous speed.

25:48.178 --> 25:50.418
It is so effective.

25:50.863 --> 25:52.863
The attention is so effective.

25:53.606 --> 25:56.808
You bring something to the attention
and immediately it acts.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.804
And when she got cured, I went to her house,

26:03.303 --> 26:04.399
and I didn’t know what to do,

26:04.434 --> 26:08.820
because [it was] very embarrassing that I told.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.257
She said, “Why did I get it Mother?”

26:10.316 --> 26:14.888
I said, “You didn’t even write a letter of thanks to me.
At least a letter of thanks to God!”

26:15.259 --> 26:16.813
After all you must thank God.

26:16.994 --> 26:20.678
If you think that, “God has cured me so what?”
it’s not so.

26:24.286 --> 26:25.746
You have to be humble about it.

26:26.003 --> 26:28.896
At least a letter of thanks she should have sent to me.

26:29.227 --> 26:33.202
And that’s how she got out of my attention completely.

26:33.938 --> 26:35.972
I mean don’t do any harm to her,

26:36.051 --> 26:38.781
but she herself jumps into such things.

26:39.070 --> 26:44.627
And when she got out of my attention,
she got this trouble.

26:45.110 --> 26:45.961
Still she argued with me,

26:45.988 --> 26:51.279
“No, no. I didn’t want to write, because I was thinking
that I was cured by doctors.” this thing, that thing.

26:51.349 --> 26:53.513
I said, “All right, go ahead with it!”

26:53.906 --> 26:57.582
She wouldn’t even write a letter of thanks,
can you imagine!

26:58.742 --> 27:02.322
And then she got back her cancer.

27:03.059 --> 27:04.833
So a letter comes back to me,

27:04.968 --> 27:11.060
saying that, “Mother now she is writing
a letter of thanks to you.” (laughing)

27:13.411 --> 27:18.585
What am I to do? Isn’t it stupid?

27:20.452 --> 27:23.990
But it can be very serious!
It’s very stupid but very serious.

27:24.198 --> 27:28.721
You shouldn’t play with the Divine Power.
It’s very dangerous.

27:28.975 --> 27:33.539
Like one journalist, who
wrote something against me

27:33.603 --> 27:38.426
and people were very furious,
very, very furious with him.

27:38.586 --> 27:41.341
Everybody was angry with him,
I said, “Forget it!”

27:42.030 --> 27:44.030
And now he’s got blood cancer.

27:44.834 --> 27:46.126
He sold his house.

27:46.163 --> 27:50.459
It was again published in the same newspaper
[that] he’s got blood cancer! (laughing).

27:51.090 --> 27:51.738
I don’t know what to say!

27:51.791 --> 27:53.801
He’s sold his house.

27:56.270 --> 28:00.579
They told me that he sold his house and everything

28:00.841 --> 28:05.541
and he’s now going to America,
and his wife is now come to Sahaj Yoga.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.948
Why go that long way?

28:08.430 --> 28:13.009
If you forget God, God doesn’t forget you.

28:13.771 --> 28:16.132
But if you forget Him,

28:16.594 --> 28:22.013
you get out of his attention,
and you go to something that is dangerous.

28:23.961 --> 28:27.532
You can see all this in Sahaja Yoga:

28:27.913 --> 28:31.684
those who have done like this,
gone out of the attention, have suffered.

28:31.863 --> 28:33.682
Not that God wants you to suffer,

28:33.761 --> 28:38.402
but, if there is light
you can see everything clearly.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.018
But when you go out of the light,

28:40.074 --> 28:43.078
you fall in a ditch, and you say,
“Why didn’t the light follow me?”

28:46.927 --> 28:50.526
It’s very stupid!
The whole thing is very stupid.

28:55.658 --> 28:56.991
When you surrender your ego,

28:57.092 --> 29:03.234
you realise that you are just
a part and parcel of the whole,

29:04.612 --> 29:07.226
and you are only are important
because you have become awakened;

29:07.379 --> 29:10.019
otherwise you are not important.

29:14.305 --> 29:27.695
All these things add up to a kind of a negativity
which gives you barrier to take Realisation.

29:28.944 --> 29:31.739
Take to your assumption
that you are a realised-soul.

29:35.065 --> 29:40.493
In a very simple way, now you have jumped in the sea,
that’s all — you have become the sea!

29:42.468 --> 29:50.306
What is there to give to Mother or to surrender —
[this is the] first point you should ask your Mr. Ego.

29:52.009 --> 29:54.276
“I myself is a problem to myself.”

29:55.344 --> 30:00.508
“If She is solving my problem,
She is taking up my problems to Herself,

30:01.130 --> 30:03.596
what am I going to surrender to Her?”

30:06.061 --> 30:19.201
I mean you are so, sometimes, in the grip of the ego
that I don’t even try my tricks to test you,

30:19.465 --> 30:23.368
because you are so premature,
you are so sensitive still.

30:23.392 --> 30:25.459
I mean I don’t know what to do.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.808
You are to be tested, but even that I don’t do.

30:30.376 --> 30:32.120
No testing, direct.

30:34.715 --> 30:36.395
Some testing is needed.

30:37.237 --> 30:42.091
After all if you have to enter to the Kingdom of God,
you have to be tested, no doubt.

30:42.621 --> 30:47.496
You also know that, those who are realised,
that many centres you catch.

30:47.863 --> 30:53.627
You jump upon your ego and superego all the time,
you have problems, still doesn’t matter.

30:53.792 --> 30:59.603
Even if you have fifth-had car Sahaja Yoga accepts you.

31:00.399 --> 31:10.182
Actually it Sahaja Yoga which is accepting all of you,
which is rendering all the help necessary.

31:11.190 --> 31:13.657
We have to be thankful to Sahaja Yoga,

31:14.162 --> 31:20.005
that it has brought such relief to all of us.
It’s such a relief.

31:20.315 --> 31:23.132
So one has to first assume
that you are realised-soul.

31:23.230 --> 31:24.804
That is the assumption you don’t have.

31:24.957 --> 31:27.466
And when you have that assumption
you think that you are realised-soul

31:27.522 --> 31:31.234
so you should shout at people,
and get angry and show off.

31:34.073 --> 31:36.915
Or you think you should extract money from Sahaja Yogis,

31:37.928 --> 31:49.814
you should try to take away sort of
like a businessman, something out of them.

31:50.213 --> 31:52.807
Or you should try to save money
at the cost of Sahaj Yoga.

31:52.855 --> 31:56.594
I mean this is absurd,
all these things are absurd.

31:58.309 --> 32:03.258
The absurdity is that you have come to gain something,

32:03.900 --> 32:08.233
you have come to the River Ganges
to fill your pitchers — all right, fill it up.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.305
You fill up the water.

32:14.844 --> 32:19.492
But when you fill up the water,

32:20.630 --> 32:23.302
you are going to use it for some purpose.

32:24.091 --> 32:27.572
Now, know that there is The Ganges within you.

32:27.952 --> 32:32.711
Assume it! Again and again I say to you,
that you assume it.

32:33.528 --> 32:38.847
The assumption will give you
whatever qualities are needed for the Spirit.

32:40.614 --> 32:45.862
You don’t need much of technique
as I told you this morning, not much of technique.

32:48.080 --> 32:55.151
What is needed is love, looking at things with love.

32:56.012 --> 32:57.310
If you are kind to someone,

32:57.449 --> 33:00.107
is it out of love or out of sympathy,

33:00.685 --> 33:06.167
or is it out of some sort of a power lust attitude,

33:06.238 --> 33:11.193
or is it out some sort of gain
that you want to get out of it.

33:11.812 --> 33:17.925
If your behaviour outside is artificial,
it is also of no use.

33:18.499 --> 33:20.211
So try to train yourself up that,

33:20.298 --> 33:23.488
“Now I have come to Sahaj Yoga
I have to train myself!”

33:23.949 --> 33:25.929
It’s a very big training centre:

33:26.159 --> 33:33.754
in you spiritual life, in your social life,
in your physical life, in your mental life.

33:34.453 --> 33:38.866
You have to cleanse your mind itself,
where the wrong things are coming from.

33:42.165 --> 33:46.005
You can cleanse
because your attention is now enlightened.

33:49.794 --> 33:53.390
Just start looking at yourself,
“What kind of thought [is] there coming into my mind?”

33:53.759 --> 33:58.826
And then once you have cleansed yourself

34:00.662 --> 34:03.696
you will feel your purity.
You will be very happy.

34:16.966 --> 34:20.803
Sahaja Yogis are my own children,

34:21.609 --> 34:24.244
they have got their own powers,

34:25.149 --> 34:27.292
they have got it, because they have got it.

34:27.752 --> 34:29.701
Nobody need be jealous of them.

34:30.089 --> 34:31.510
Everybody can get it.

34:32.705 --> 34:35.134
God wants it to happen, it has happened.

34:35.630 --> 34:38.634
It is all prophesised that it is going to happen.

34:39.292 --> 34:43.709
But if you don’t understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga…

34:44.210 --> 34:47.944
because if you judge from the gross angle
you cannot understand Sahaj Yoga.

34:50.615 --> 34:54.404
You have to know you have become a subtler being
and everything is on a subtle level;

34:54.694 --> 34:57.791
as I said in the morning only,
that you have become sukshma now.

34:58.024 --> 34:59.624
You have become now.

35:00.092 --> 35:02.723
You are different person.
You are not the same person.

35:03.024 --> 35:06.195
As the egg has become the bird,
it’s a different thing altogether.

35:06.552 --> 35:12.218
Take out all that was before — that,
if you call ‘surrender’, all right!

35:14.361 --> 35:19.412
and assume your own powers,
to become very powerful yourself.

35:31.286 --> 35:35.210
Now if there are any other questions
you ask me. Ask me.

35:40.226 --> 35:44.617
(In Marathi: You should all learn English.

35:45.028 --> 35:48.013
Your Mother has learned so you should also learn.

35:48.589 --> 35:50.785
Now the God understands English!

35:50.995 --> 35:55.309
I understand, that means that God understands!)

35:56.340 --> 35:58.719
Yogis: Mother, can I ask a question.

35:58.822 --> 36:02.890
Today I was asked the following question
I didn’t know how to answer that.

36:03.679 --> 36:15.194
The person which usually feels very well in the fingers,
didn’t have ego finger burning, yet couldn’t surrender.

36:16.796 --> 36:26.006
So what is the position of not being capable of surrender,
fighting to surrender, yet the finger was not burning.

36:26.315 --> 36:30.100
Shri Mataji: The reason is stupidity,
is absolutely stupidity.

36:30.364 --> 36:31.796
I mean how can you explain this?

36:31.915 --> 36:35.818
You see, you are feeling the cool breeze in the hand,
you are feeling all right,

36:36.158 --> 36:37.859
still you are saying, “I am not going to surrender!”

36:37.938 --> 36:43.309
Must be some sort of a bull.
I mean you just see!

36:43.453 --> 36:45.108
How do you explain such a person?

36:45.285 --> 36:49.202
That person is not honest, [is] dishonest in simple words.

36:49.977 --> 36:53.716
Even if you are feeling the cool breeze
in the hand, you are feeling better,

36:53.843 --> 36:57.816
you are feeling the vibrations as promised by Adi Shankrachaya,

36:58.001 --> 37:02.276
everything you see, and also you
read Blake and you see all that,

37:02.406 --> 37:03.489
[and] still you don’t want to believe it,

37:03.560 --> 37:07.091
that means you are stupid, you are just like a bull.

37:07.634 --> 37:14.063
Here a bull, is all right, healthy,
is perfectly in good condition

37:14.234 --> 37:18.510
and just sits on the street.

37:20.168 --> 37:22.811
And you ask him, “Why sir, why are you sitting on the street?”

37:24.024 --> 37:25.508
And he says, “I don’t want to surrender!”

37:25.871 --> 37:27.551
“Baba you are all right?

37:28.925 --> 37:29.807
What is matter with you?

37:29.924 --> 37:30.767
Why are you sitting here?”

37:31.167 --> 37:35.284
“No, I don’t want to surrender myself
to all the other traffic! I want sit here.”

37:36.938 --> 37:38.309
“But why?”

37:39.224 --> 37:44.905
Then there is a method (laughter).

37:49.433 --> 37:52.386
For such stupid people there is method for that!

37:52.521 --> 37:55.609
And then they run! (laughter)

37:56.016 --> 37:57.219
This is absolute stupid!

37:57.311 --> 38:01.009
There’s nothing more than that
[which] can be said about a person like that!

38:01.131 --> 38:03.211
He doesn’t want to surrender, means what?

38:03.534 --> 38:06.116
What is he not wanting to do?

38:07.325 --> 38:10.108
I mean as surrender what do you do?
Just think about it.

38:10.356 --> 38:14.290
Then you tell them, you surrender, you surrender.
(break in recording)

38:14.483 --> 38:18.691
Such a person is possessed
and the possession comes back on the person.

38:19.148 --> 38:22.712
For a while it is all right
and then again there’s a possession which gives it ideas.

38:22.764 --> 38:24.017
Again it’s all right.

38:24.113 --> 38:26.117
It’s a wobbly character, that’s all we can say.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.895
It’s a very wobbly character.

38:28.039 --> 38:32.135
And one should take oneself to task
for such a nonsensical thing.

38:32.903 --> 38:35.604
I mean, just think of it.

38:37.592 --> 38:42.010
Such behaviour is possible before Realisation.

38:42.373 --> 38:47.190
After Realisation, once you have felt something,
what is it?

38:50.643 --> 38:52.903
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity.

38:53.007 --> 38:55.177
Trying to show off, you can say, at the most.

38:55.361 --> 38:58.094
Such a person is just trying to show off,

38:58.472 --> 39:00.209
like a bull sitting on the street

39:00.470 --> 39:04.054
is trying to show off,
“Every traffic is waiting for me!”

39:04.469 --> 39:06.512
He’s feeling very happy about it.

39:06.746 --> 39:07.905
It has a nuisance value.

39:08.607 --> 39:11.401
Such people are nothing but they are a nuisance value!

39:11.617 --> 39:14.496
They are nothing but a nuisance value.
They are a nuisance.

39:15.286 --> 39:21.404
By creating a nuisance, like in
England we have now these punk rocks —

39:21.689 --> 39:23.031
what do they achieve?

39:23.176 --> 39:28.614
Just create a disharmony,
a stupid feeling and a repulsion, that’s all.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.424
They just do it because, you see,

39:31.737 --> 39:35.077
if they feel they are neglected sometimes,
they do like this.

39:35.970 --> 39:37.719
Then they create a nuisance out of them[selves].

39:37.856 --> 39:40.756
So everybody pays attention to such a person.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.721
The best way is to neglect that!

39:44.228 --> 39:46.706
That is the best way is to neglect such people
who talk like this,

39:46.846 --> 39:51.280
then they will not have to surrender
and take two running jumps and go to hell!

39:53.817 --> 39:55.497
Then they are all right.

39:55.716 --> 39:57.649
Don’t fuss about such people.

39:57.871 --> 39:58.918
They are fussy people.

39:59.060 --> 40:00.238
They want to fuss about themselves.

40:00.302 --> 40:02.296
They want everybody to fuss about them.

40:02.420 --> 40:05.748
We should say, “You better spare Sahaj Yoga and us!”

40:09.602 --> 40:13.476
Yogi: Why the perfect God Mother,
this is a question they asked me, many people,

40:13.678 --> 40:16.686
why the perfect God created the imperfect world

40:16.993 --> 40:22.012
and why so many people don’t have even the seeking
and they are going in the opposite direction?

40:23.282 --> 40:28.812
Shri Mataji: You ask the people.
(break in recording)

40:33.105 --> 40:36.506
Everyone! French should learn English!

40:37.216 --> 40:39.084
If you try to learn, it’s not difficult.

40:39.220 --> 40:40.931
If Indians can learn English why can’t you.

40:40.988 --> 40:42.918
Your Mother can’t speak French.

40:43.124 --> 40:44.191
It’s a very difficult language.

40:44.310 --> 40:52.214
You have to turn your tongue so much
that my Vishuddhi goes out of order.

40:53.535 --> 40:54.499
I can’t speak.

40:54.749 --> 40:57.220
I have tried to say your way,
but I just can’t say.

40:59.470 --> 41:00.830
I tried, you see.

41:01.589 --> 41:04.108
So it’s better you learn English language.

41:04.489 --> 41:06.289
It’s not difficult for you.

41:07.103 --> 41:12.317
Most of the English words which are subtle
are borrowed from French!

41:13.742 --> 41:20.691
(Mother demonstrates a few words
similar between English and French)

41:28.318 --> 41:35.707
Now ‘Vincent’ everybody says, ‘Vincent’,
but you will say, ’Vanson’.

41:37.719 --> 41:39.669
You see, this is individualism.

41:40.153 --> 41:41.728
Now we have become collective,

41:41.943 --> 41:45.207
try to learn a language which everyone understands.

41:46.033 --> 41:49.117
It’s not difficult
for French people to learn English words.

41:49.627 --> 41:53.213
Indians are very good at languages I tell you.

41:53.592 --> 41:55.659
They are the best in languages.

41:56.957 --> 42:01.757
If they want they can learn any language
so they should have no compunction.

42:02.535 --> 42:08.118
Should try to learn three languages,
as much as that you could follow me.

42:10.297 --> 42:17.902
Of course you can’t understand Hindi and Marathi so much
as you can understand English.

42:18.361 --> 42:20.203
So try at least.

42:20.544 --> 42:25.583
But that doesn’t mean that those who know English
should not know any other language!

42:25.805 --> 42:29.837
Like our Hindi speaking people,
they never try to learn any other language,

42:29.870 --> 42:32.814
because everybody has to speak Hindi language.

42:34.844 --> 42:41.517
So those who are not well versed in other languages
should try to learn other languages.

42:41.758 --> 42:44.558
You must learn some language in Sahaja Yoga.

42:45.238 --> 42:49.773
Say you may learn Sanskrit, you may learn Hindi, Marathi.

42:50.271 --> 42:53.615
If you know English,
that is not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga.

42:53.972 --> 42:56.505
You have to talk to other people also.

42:58.581 --> 43:02.485
If you really want to be effective
you have to know something.

43:05.173 --> 43:11.220
You will help me a lot if you know French,
because in France [when] I go, I get lost.

43:12.458 --> 43:13.901
In Spain [when] I go I get lost.

43:14.421 --> 43:20.889
We went to Spain and we had taken one lady with us
who was going to translate me

43:21.342 --> 43:26.291
and she got nervous
and I didn’t know how to talk to people.

43:26.728 --> 43:29.908
Then suddenly somebody came up
and he said, “I would like to translate you.”

43:36.924 --> 43:41.917
It is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis to do anything

43:42.496 --> 43:44.202
because they become so dynamic.

43:44.417 --> 43:46.024
If they get to it, they can do it.

43:46.268 --> 43:47.094
It’s very simple.

43:47.154 --> 43:51.803
So just think that you have to know
about other languages also,

43:52.065 --> 43:54.680
like Australians know only English, that’s not good.

43:54.917 --> 43:58.097
They must know one more language,
at least one more language.

43:58.522 --> 44:03.204
And for that they should try to get somebody
to teach them one more language.

44:03.964 --> 44:06.205
At least two languages you must know.

44:09.944 --> 44:12.672
I mean [if] you want to become
universal and stick onto one language,

44:12.743 --> 44:14.292
how will you become universal?

44:14.665 --> 44:17.465
Those who join maybe have to know English.

44:17.831 --> 44:19.837
Japanese also have to know English.

44:19.979 --> 44:24.497
I know this definitely, they have to know English,
because all naval terminologies are in English.

44:24.583 --> 44:31.397
Those who join airways, they have to know English
because everything is translated in English.

44:33.087 --> 44:43.362
Any other thing which is doing
a universal work or manifestation,

44:43.431 --> 44:46.601
they have to know English, it is important.

44:47.373 --> 44:48.988
So this will not be a waste.

44:49.228 --> 44:57.544
But in no way I would say that English language
is that perfect to describe Sahaja Yoga, in no way.

44:57.816 --> 45:01.415
But you have to know to understand anything.

45:02.567 --> 45:04.911
And we have to introduce new words also to explain.

45:05.054 --> 45:10.795
But for you people
it is important to know two languages.

45:11.218 --> 45:16.106
Either know Marathi and English or Hindi or English.

45:17.792 --> 45:22.288
But if it is easy and if you want to know,

45:22.360 --> 45:26.408
you should know these three languages
if possible, little bit of it.

45:28.424 --> 45:33.998
Marathi is the most difficult,
but Hindi is not so difficult.

45:35.539 --> 45:37.708
Because we have to communicate.
We have to have a rapport.

45:38.061 --> 45:43.090
Or there is another language,
we can just sign — deaf and dumb language.

45:48.302 --> 45:49.765
You can try that.

45:49.919 --> 45:51.652
But it’s also complicated.

45:51.785 --> 45:54.652
You see, we had one deaf and dumb gentleman

45:55.609 --> 45:58.302
and for marriage he used to say like that, you see.

45:58.762 --> 46:01.010
So how will you know that marriage is this [sign].

46:01.122 --> 46:04.194
Because in marriage they put akshatas on people.

46:04.636 --> 46:08.376
So what he was [doing] was describing everything
according to his customs.

46:08.650 --> 46:12.394
And in England people would not understand
what does that mean (laughter).

46:15.274 --> 46:19.165
They might think, ‘throwing stones’.

46:22.422 --> 46:26.191
Now those who have not used kumkum,
say for example, if you say this one.

46:26.632 --> 46:28.513
So that means the wife
according to (Indian sign language).

46:28.728 --> 46:30.661
Or mangala sutra he will say.

46:30.951 --> 46:33.598
And now those who never wear mangala sutra,
how will you know?

46:34.431 --> 46:41.717
So, you see, even deaf and dumb language is very much
affected by the locality or the place you live in.

46:42.216 --> 46:45.497
All right, so let us decide
to know some other language also.
