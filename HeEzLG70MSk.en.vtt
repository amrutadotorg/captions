00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.860
American Yogi: Thank you.

00:00:01.887 --> 00:00:03.404
Fine, great.

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:05.329
American Yogi: That’s not all.

00:00:05.352 --> 00:00:06.698
That’s not all.
American Yogi: No

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:09.563
American Yogi: We have been inspired by your shopping Shri Mataji.

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.951
American Yogi: We have been inspired by your shopping.

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:16.293
So this is for Bridgetta.

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:17.146
Shri Mataji: Who?

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.602
American Yogi: Bridgetta.

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:29.853
Let me see, oh! Beautiful.

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:33.516
Turkish Yogi: Beautiful.

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:44.005
American Yogi: Shri Mataji this is for you from America

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.046
got it printed here in Turkey.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.592
 [UNaudible]

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.450
Yogis: Wow, nice.

00:00:57.793 --> 00:00:58.773
Thank you.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.997
Now, so, too much. [laughter]

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:16.930
Yogini: Can I open it?

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:17.941
Yes, please.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.676
Now you see, there should be some room we need to take things also, isn’t it.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.718
So, it doesn't help.

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:39.715
So beautiful.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.046
Yogi: From where?

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.760
Yogini: The bazaar, the Grand Bazaar.

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:51.108
Yes, a handy craft place.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.963
Thank you very much.

00:02:04.376 --> 00:02:06.156
Yogi: [unclear]

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.969
[unclear] funny, you’re not yet married.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.106
Yogi: Something simple but... [unclear]

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:30.885
Yogi: This is from Greece.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.445
 its candles! Made out of 100% pure Ghee.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.861
Ah uh  [how] wonderful they’re.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:45.885
tremendous

00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:49.425
Yogi: They take like twelve hours for one to burn.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.152
Is it?
Yogi: Very good to put on overnight and then for fires.

00:02:54.177 --> 00:02:55.805
12 minutes is good, you see.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.350
Greece has some very miraculous things.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.736
All right, thank you very much.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.531
All right let us do some talking.

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:19.774
Yogi: Mother, can be kept closed.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.196
What is the next thing we will be follow on,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.435
 So whose translating?

00:03:30.565 --> 00:03:31.765
All right.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:42.478
so we have to do the translation also to these people about what are we going to do next, all right.

00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:43.405
All right?

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.655
First thing is that now there will be people coming,

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:50.599
those who are coming,

00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:52.365
new people will be coming.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.563
And to attend to new people you have to remember one thing.

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:03.204
that you should not,

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:12.231
try to impress on them that you are something better than them.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.775
Those who are already much better

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.516
Because their valency has gone up there,

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.548
so this valency eleven, twelve like that, you see.

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:36.373
It's improved, valency.

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:41.689
Yogi: Your what? [UNaudible]

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:45.515
Yogi: It's the ten commandments, ten valency.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.475
After realization, you got more valency.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.115
You can give realization.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.360
First of all, you can give realization to them.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.295
And also you can give vibrations to matter

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:24.830
to say your trees, flowers, you can give vibrations to them.

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.493
Translator Yogi: Living things or also unliving things?

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.617
Can I give vibrations to unliving things also?

00:05:32.642 --> 00:05:35.355
Yes, yes.
 they all get vibrated,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.355
Now see if I’m sitting here then the vibrations come

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.915
 if i’m putting my feet here, there’s vibrations.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.536
I must tell you about Hazret Muhammad.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.240
Translator Yogi: Shall I first translate –

00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:48.045
First you tell.

00:06:06.742 --> 00:06:09.983
Now, about Hazrat Mohammed, once I went to Kashmir

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.702
with my husband
and we were going in one direction.

00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:21.868
Translator Yogi: Do you mean Hazrat Mohammed or –

00:06:21.893 --> 00:06:23.422
No, I was going.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.204
And a very like, a wilderness,

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.284
it was like a jungle

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.696
and there I felt tremendous vibrations.

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:36.561
Translator Yogi: Is vibrations?

00:06:36.586 --> 00:06:37.895
I felt vibrations.

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:50.011
And I told my husband that there must be some very holy place somewhere.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.842
So I told the driver, I said to take the car this way.

00:07:04.647 --> 00:07:07.033
But he said ”there’s nothing here, you see, nothing here”.

00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:08.687
He was saying, driver was saying.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.707
So we reached a place where there was some Muslims,

00:07:15.732 --> 00:07:19.252
very poor Muslims were living in that area.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.489
So we asked them is there any temples here, what is this place you see?

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.414
They said ” No but about a mile away there is Hazrat Ikbal”.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.872
So one hair of Mohammed Hazrat is kept there in that place, one hair.

00:07:58.037 --> 00:08:01.796
And I got his vibrations at least five miles ahead.

00:08:02.073 --> 00:08:05.020
I felt the vibrations five miles away from there.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.315
So vibrations are that tremendous.

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:18.824
Have you see my photograph or poster up, all of them?

00:08:18.849 --> 00:08:19.835
Yes, yes.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.095
You have seen, where?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.536
The photo, show me picture of Shri Mataji, with light.

00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:27.994
Yogi: Yes, yes. We have seen.

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:30.860
No, no of my Sahasrara being shown?

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:34.091
Yogi: Did you see the ones with the Sahasrara open?

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:35.995
Translator Yogi: Yes, yes. Carla showed that.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.266
So you can imagine how powerful is the light,

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:45.036
that everything vanished but just my Sahasrara was showing.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.026
Have you seen it?

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:57.221
Yogi: Yes, yes. Kundalini rising...

00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:02.332
So the vibrations are a very powerful thing

00:09:05.185 --> 00:09:09.597
and they know everything, they know everything.

00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:22.572
And their whole thing was –

00:09:22.859 --> 00:09:24.135
[Unclear]

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.222
She can't see, she is short so she can't see.

00:09:30.407 --> 00:09:36.257
So their action is such that they know everything

00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:38.723
and they know how to act.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.240
They will guide you

00:09:49.686 --> 00:09:51.961
and they will protect you

00:09:53.888 --> 00:09:59.267
but know you must know that you have a new awareness of a vibratary awareness.

00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:08.933
You see and you must use that.

00:10:11.352 --> 00:10:14.510
If you don’t use your vibratary awareness then

00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:17.986
with human awareness you will be making mistakes.

00:10:22.862 --> 00:10:27.720
So for everything you must use your vibrations to find out what is it.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:40.372
Now the problems comes in when you have new people

00:10:47.654 --> 00:10:51.552
because they watch you.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.127
What have you achieved?

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.075
How you look?

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.768
How you behave?

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:02.595
How you talk?

00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:13.822
And suddenly you should not tell them that you are caught up,

00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:16.277
you’ve got a bhoot in you like that you see.

00:11:22.795 --> 00:11:25.723
On the contrary you should be very gentle

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:29.799
and very hospitable

00:11:32.499 --> 00:11:35.040
because now they are just coming,

00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:37.181
they see your behaviour

00:11:37.409 --> 00:11:41.975
and then only they realise that these are some special people.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.381
And never argue in their presence.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.156
Now supposing he says something,

00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.751
now one should not say ”No, no this is not so”

00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:05.940
in the presence of others

00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:14.860
but support each other.

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:22.606
And also you have to talk about Sahaja Yoga in the beginning

00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:25.927
not about Me, much.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.866
And you have to – you can have a course also we are now having courses

00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:39.345
for chakras, every chakra per day we are having courses like that

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.074
you can have like that

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:43.899
so they get deeper and deeper into it.

00:12:51.706 --> 00:12:54.018
Then you can say something to them.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:13:04.628
Otherwise they can, they can you see, first they try to judge you people.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.492
Now you will be amazed when I come, always I don’t know why

00:13:15.517 --> 00:13:18.680
there will be thousands of people everywhere.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.280
I don’t know what happens maybe the vibrations work it out, I don’t know.

00:13:32.527 --> 00:13:35.268
Because I when to a place like Colombia

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.643
where nobody knows Me, nothing of the kind, you see.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.915
And even outside of the hall in the garden

00:13:49.293 --> 00:13:50.693
there was such a crowd,

00:13:51.772 --> 00:13:53.939
I didn’t know how to get inside.

00:13:56.191 --> 00:14:00.093
But then for the follow on very few came

00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:04.232
and then gradually they started to the introducing.

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:08.677
Translator Yogi: You mean very few came to courses?

00:14:10.013 --> 00:14:11.378
Yogi: Yes for follow up…

00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:19.198
But this, you see this is the try of the Paramchaitanya

00:14:19.486 --> 00:14:25.007
I think so that when you people are perfect,

00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:28.493
everything is fine, you’re all right

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:33.634
then the Paramchaitanya itself organises to a certain point.

00:14:39.566 --> 00:14:42.294
Chaitanya, He’s this all pervading power.

00:14:45.505 --> 00:14:49.288
So it is important that you should also meditate,

00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:50.788
you all should meditate.

00:14:55.302 --> 00:14:57.535
And you should also go deep.

00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:12.433
And they – your ascent is such a thing that as if like the sari you lift it to see

00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:14.615
the whole things come out like that.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.390
Once you ascend the whole of Turkey will start coming out.

00:15:26.732 --> 00:15:29.355
So it’s a very big responsibility

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.041
and I am sure you will work it out.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.079
Now if you have any problems you tell me.

00:15:51.626 --> 00:15:53.466
He has a question.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:14.895
Translator Yogi: He has a question, he says sometimes my finger becomes cold

00:16:14.927 --> 00:16:20.495
and sometimes hot, sometimes there is a tingling.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.780
Are all of them –

00:16:22.805 --> 00:16:25.180
All the fingers or one? One finger.

00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:30.533
Translator Yogi: No, examples he says.

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:35.374
So now you should know you are a recording machine like a barometer.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.020
You shouldn’t worry about that

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.809
But you should know that there is somebody

00:16:44.834 --> 00:16:47.220
but you should know that there is somebody like that

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.222
there that you’re catching,

00:16:49.247 --> 00:16:52.625
somebody around you or sitting next to you or…

00:17:06.173 --> 00:17:10.438
You’ll be sitting there, there’s no need for you to go away.

00:17:14.765 --> 00:17:21.445
So now this is a feeling, go on seeing, go on feeling like that you see.

00:17:21.493 --> 00:17:24.087
So you are just recording it.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.443
Translator Yogi: He means…

00:17:27.468 --> 00:17:30.813
If he feels anywhere just recording you see

00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:33.638
but one should not fall into too much about this.

00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:43.263
Translator Yogi: He means if he feels cold

00:17:43.288 --> 00:17:47.012
or if he feels hot or if he feels pulsating

00:17:47.037 --> 00:17:48.594
or if he feels tickling

00:17:48.625 --> 00:17:50.897
all of them has different meaning.

00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:53.807
No, no. If you feel hot, means something is wrong with the person,

00:17:53.832 --> 00:17:56.215
if he’s feeling cool and nice it’s all right.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.887
But if he’s pulsating that means he’s,

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:02.170
is about to get his –

00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:05.583
he’s capable of getting vibrations by being cleansing.

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.289
Translator Yogi: Good vibes.

00:18:07.314 --> 00:18:10.194
but not very good but he’s capable

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:13.546
I mean the vibrations are working as pulsation means

00:18:13.571 --> 00:18:16.655
that he might get realisation

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.640
but he should not pay so much attention

00:18:19.993 --> 00:18:23.510
because if you go on every time judging you’ll go mad.

00:18:25.342 --> 00:18:28.530
Translator Yogi: Yeah. If he’s numb, no?

00:18:28.555 --> 00:18:33.116
One should not try to – sort of mental too much think about it.

00:19:13.494 --> 00:19:18.867
And also one should not [UNCLEAR]… walking on the street,

00:19:18.892 --> 00:19:23.195
might see somebody feel their cool, you might feel their hot, you might feel anything.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.612
Then you should not just go and ask him about it or something

00:19:26.637 --> 00:19:29.530
because you have to do it very carefully.

00:19:29.853 --> 00:19:32.535
Everybody is not worthy of realisation,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.515
you have do to it very carefully.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.351
You can come to program,

00:19:36.376 --> 00:19:38.535
they are there then gradually

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.385
you can but on the street here, there if you go on

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.676
then there will be problems.

00:20:10.066 --> 00:20:13.047
Because you are realised souls and they’re not.

00:20:19.926 --> 00:20:24.312
Like here is too much smoking as I’ve seen people have too much smoking

00:20:24.337 --> 00:20:28.758
and with smoking you catch Vishuddhi both the Vishuddhi’s very much all the time.

00:20:28.783 --> 00:20:32.025
The reason is then you smoke you also feel guilty

00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:37.128
because smoke is right Vishuddhi because you feel guilty, left Vishuddhi.

00:20:57.537 --> 00:21:02.936
Then also that see when talking to them about their gurus

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:06.599
so immediately you should not sort of jump on them.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.735
But you should just slowly say that see if this guru business doesn’t work out in Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.573
very gradually.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.354
And it effects you because you should quarrel with them or fight with them

00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:39.014
or if you talk to much from them. You may catch from them.

00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:42.229
So if anybody is having a guru or anything

00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:44.621
first don't try, that  difficult towards you

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:46.686
so try easier ones.

00:21:59.133 --> 00:22:02.967
Or just tell them that they should put the left hand forwards the photograph, towards the light

00:22:02.992 --> 00:22:07.598
 and say that ”Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru” like that.

00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:25.308
 ‘I am my own master’.

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:30.261
So that they will clear out. Once they have cleared out  they should be –

00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:31.876
then it’s all right.

00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:35.706
But otherwise they’ll argue with you, what’s wrong with this person?  Why not?

00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:37.721
This, that, they will go on arguing.

00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:42.645
So an argument doesn’t give realisation, tell them doesn’t give.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.577
Also they’ll ask you this book we have read, that book we have read.

00:22:55.602 --> 00:22:58.759
Have you read this book or not? That book have you read or not?

00:22:58.784 --> 00:23:01.300
You should say by reading book its doesn’t work out.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.946
In a humble way, in a humble way.

00:23:18.307 --> 00:23:22.713
Also you can do one more thing,

00:23:22.738 --> 00:23:26.010
that I also read a lot but it didn’t work out,

00:23:26.048 --> 00:23:29.914
if you take it upon yourself, they will not feel hurt.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:46.093
Yogi: I have to say, we also read lots of books and didn’t help us.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:58.576
So in the beginning it’s a little difficult

00:23:58.601 --> 00:24:01.485
but gradually things will improve,  I’m sure.

00:24:11.906 --> 00:24:15.682
But you must meditate, morning, evening both days,

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.616
both times you must meditate.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.433
Translator Yogi: Morning and evening.

00:24:19.453 --> 00:24:22.354
Morning, yes. Morning just without water,

00:24:22.379 --> 00:24:26.554
you can just sit down before the photograph but don’t close your eyes, keep your eyes open,

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:29.830
feel the vibrations, know what chakras are catching

00:24:29.855 --> 00:24:31.895
and try to correct them.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.591
And in the evening again before sleeping you put your feet in the water,

00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:39.903
then foot soak yourself, meditate and sleep.

00:24:55.378 --> 00:24:57.004
And some people believe that

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:00.504
we’ll do it in our house privately, it doesn’t work!

00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:12.607
You see you have to be in the collective –

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:13.928
Translator Yogi: You have to be?

00:25:13.952 --> 00:25:17.420
you have to be in collective,you must attend programs.

00:25:22.676 --> 00:25:26.952
It's very important. Because it’s like this you see

00:25:26.977 --> 00:25:30.868
that when you churn the yogurt

00:25:30.899 --> 00:25:33.863
then the butter comes up.

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:44.729
And you put a little butter in it, you see and collect all the butter.

00:25:52.746 --> 00:25:57.472
But all the particles which are left out, are of no use they are lost.

00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:06.976
So we have to be in the collective, we must meet.

00:26:13.758 --> 00:26:17.742
If you do not attend programs, you cannot grow.

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:28.482
Yes?

00:26:44.342 --> 00:26:49.025
Translator Yogi: Since he landed to Turkey he cannot think anything.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:54.384
He thinks, he said his head is empty.

00:26:57.713 --> 00:27:02.789
That's the best, if you are in – when you are in thoughtless awareness then you grow spiritually.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:18.460
Translator Yogi: When he is working he cannot concentrate on work.

00:27:18.485 --> 00:27:22.937
No you see there is, you feel that way but everything will be worked out.

00:27:27.153 --> 00:27:30.214
There was a lady who used to run a shop

00:27:30.239 --> 00:27:34.269
and she knew each and everything what was in the shop and all that.

00:27:34.353 --> 00:27:39.241
Then she did not remember anything

00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:41.722
and she was still selling things

00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:44.811
and she made five times more profit.

00:27:45.626 --> 00:27:47.346
Yogi: After realisation?

00:27:48.473 --> 00:27:49.866
Yogi: After realisation?

00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:51.633
After realization, yes.

00:28:06.466 --> 00:28:08.606
You are looking after.

00:28:08.633 --> 00:28:11.055
No, no, no need.

00:28:11.086 --> 00:28:13.281
no need to use your brains.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.497
Everything will be done.

00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:33.220
You are in peace and everything is worked out.

00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:43.464
There’s no need to concentrate at all,

00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:47.709
somebody – like the whole thing is concentrating for you.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.368
 concentrating on you.

00:28:58.505 --> 00:29:02.100
All right everybody will notice that, miracles after miracles.

00:29:11.026 --> 00:29:12.635
What is your question?

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.323
Yogi: Because of the Muslims don’t for example pray

00:29:16.348 --> 00:29:18.843
to one picture to things like that.

00:29:18.868 --> 00:29:23.945
In Turkey since we for example make one puja, the first puja it was alright.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:29.680
After we make the first puja it was all of us and some of them go away.

00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:34.531
No, no should not, actually puja should be introduce very late.

00:29:34.556 --> 00:29:37.208
That should be very few people should do puja.

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:39.293
Everybody cannot also do puja.

00:29:39.313 --> 00:29:40.313
Yogi: Okay.

00:29:40.338 --> 00:29:41.405
It is very difficult.

00:29:42.367 --> 00:29:46.615
Anyone you see when we do not allow anybody to do puja,

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.260
they at least have two years in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:49.293 --> 00:29:50.973
Yogi: Yes, yes all right.

00:29:51.073 --> 00:29:52.614
Two years they have to be.

00:30:09.464 --> 00:30:13.601
Even from Russian I told them

00:30:13.626 --> 00:30:18.701
that only ones who are being in  this thing for quite sometime

00:30:18.809 --> 00:30:23.551
should be brought to India otherwise no pujas allowed, not allowed.

00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:36.968
I mean

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.691
Mohammed Sahib has said it that till you get your kıyama state

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:48.953
you should not – you can go on doing  loike this namaz and all that,

00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:51.698
till that not after that.

00:30:53.139 --> 00:30:54.556
Till your resurrection.

00:30:57.935 --> 00:30:59.615
Till your resurrection.

00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:03.813
you should do all  namaz  and all these restrictions  and everything

00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:08.327
but after resurrection, nothing he said so.  No need.

00:31:08.672 --> 00:31:11.205
Translator Yogi: Our realisation, no?

00:31:11.408 --> 00:31:13.473
Till our realisation?

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.572
 After your realisation is your resurrection, Kiyama

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.485
Now you’re resurrected so there is no need for you to do

00:31:37.782 --> 00:31:40.379
anything that has been said tabooed

00:31:40.396 --> 00:31:43.560
or stopped even now, Quran.

00:31:44.324 --> 00:31:47.349
That is still you get your resurrection.

00:31:48.582 --> 00:31:50.090
Now you are free!

00:31:50.115 --> 00:31:52.137
Translator Yogi: Yes is it not necessary Namaz and ...

00:31:52.162 --> 00:31:56.761
Yes that, all that it has to be done, all these restrictions are there

00:31:56.784 --> 00:31:59.991
for women, men everything is there

00:32:00.016 --> 00:32:03.537
till you get your resurrection to build up your dharma,

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.784
to build up your sustenance.

00:32:20.765 --> 00:32:24.119
And Islam, Islam means to surrender.

00:32:28.115 --> 00:32:29.998
Surrender to truth

00:32:31.693 --> 00:32:34.845
 it means surrender to truth.

00:32:39.317 --> 00:32:42.572
And in the Quran it is also written that be careful

00:32:42.585 --> 00:32:45.396
there will be many who are non believers

00:32:51.988 --> 00:32:55.174
and will be many who are argumentative.

00:32:59.378 --> 00:33:02.504
But once you know you have found the truth

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.980
then you must surrender to truth.

00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:17.888
So first you must know you have found the truth,

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.921
you should be sure about it.

00:33:27.678 --> 00:33:30.059
Then only you can surrender.

00:33:34.865 --> 00:33:38.828
Then you go beyond everything,  you become a universal being.

00:33:48.837 --> 00:33:54.581
Yes, it’s a – when I have see the Jews worshipping Hazrat Muhammed

00:34:00.388 --> 00:34:05.749
and the Muslims worshipping the Shri Rama

00:34:05.772 --> 00:34:07.472
something like that.

00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:16.350
In the name of religion how can anybody fight.

00:34:22.623 --> 00:34:25.613
But going on like that the fanatics are there,

00:34:25.638 --> 00:34:27.279
the fanaticism is there

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.616
but that shows that they’re blind.

00:34:34.848 --> 00:34:37.292
But now as you have got the light,

00:34:37.317 --> 00:34:39.942
you must live with confidence.

00:34:49.092 --> 00:34:50.092
All right.

00:34:53.927 --> 00:34:57.242
Yogi: When making – for example meditation in the

00:34:57.258 --> 00:34:59.880
you come to the program,

00:34:59.895 --> 00:35:02.265
a some of them also must be that here

00:35:02.283 --> 00:35:05.095
sense or some other people sent over or they come by themselves?

00:35:05.107 --> 00:35:07.045
Like for example İbrahim

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:08.530
or for example I was.

00:35:08.725 --> 00:35:11.473
I was for three months somewhere

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.372
but if I was see ten years

00:35:13.397 --> 00:35:16.075
or TM, ten years these people won’t comes

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.684
and make mediation in us,

00:35:17.695 --> 00:35:19.912
I’ve seen these days also I understand also,

00:35:19.937 --> 00:35:22.565
who speak with Akbar, with Mr Engin

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:29.190
that or the cool breeze gets more, more long, not easily.

00:35:29.215 --> 00:35:38.380
So these people broke our vibrations they don’t come early.

00:35:38.918 --> 00:35:41.088
Yogi: So they must put them out –

00:35:41.113 --> 00:35:43.625
Another Yogi: He’s saying that

00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:45.641
when we meditate

00:35:45.675 --> 00:35:48.534
there is one person from rational domination

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.607
which is ten years there,

00:35:50.621 --> 00:35:54.622
he’s meditating with us, he disturb our meditation.

00:35:54.812 --> 00:35:58.235
Yogi: We feel this day, Mother, we feel this day more ....[Unclear]

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.471
if he’s meditating, you just tell him.

00:36:00.484 --> 00:36:03.270
You meditate with left hand towards the photograph

00:36:03.295 --> 00:36:05.785
with the light and right hand on the Mother earth

00:36:05.802 --> 00:36:07.878
so he clears out

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:09.381
then he won’t disturb you

00:36:09.399 --> 00:36:14.059
and you take a bhandan yourself, you cover yourself up, you see.

00:36:14.586 --> 00:36:17.550
Because poor thing he is a seeker,

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:20.186
transcendental fellow is a seeker

00:36:20.204 --> 00:36:22.196
and the mistake is gone,

00:36:22.203 --> 00:36:25.138
we must try to save.

00:36:25.397 --> 00:36:27.162
That’s the point.

00:36:27.364 --> 00:36:28.564
Just stand up.

00:36:51.694 --> 00:36:53.111
This is it,

00:36:53.308 --> 00:36:56.821
 [UNCLEAR] not, not difficult so much.

00:36:57.328 --> 00:36:59.211
TM people are not so difficult

00:36:59.236 --> 00:37:02.814
of course in the beginning they might shake or something.

00:37:08.853 --> 00:37:09.997
They’re easier

00:37:10.105 --> 00:37:12.813
but the Sarachnis's people are horrible.

00:37:32.627 --> 00:37:37.999
Translator Yogi: What do you understand when he speak about Deities.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.020
About what?

00:37:39.065 --> 00:37:42.050
Translator Yogi: The manifestation of God,

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:46.393
you say manifestation of God, what does it mean?

00:37:46.622 --> 00:37:50.777
Yogi: Deities, I think she wants to know about the Deities?

00:37:53.818 --> 00:37:56.115
See they are aspects of God.

00:37:59.751 --> 00:38:01.984
They are aspects of God, you see.

00:38:04.496 --> 00:38:07.029
But for that you need not talk just now,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.892
you talk in a general way.

00:38:12.472 --> 00:38:13.714
Is he your son? Is it,

00:38:19.558 --> 00:38:21.629
Come along. Hello, how do you do?

00:38:31.912 --> 00:38:36.708
Translator Yogi: So we talked about that afterwards, not now?

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:38.787
What about?

00:38:38.812 --> 00:38:40.927
Just now you talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:43.428 --> 00:38:46.011
Yogi: To the new people she meant.

00:38:46.036 --> 00:38:50.342
Translator Yogi: No to us, she wants to learn.

00:38:50.367 --> 00:38:50.942
Yogi: No.

00:38:50.967 --> 00:38:58.184
Translator Yogi: She says, what does it mean the aspects of Divine manifestation of God

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.706
or what does it mean she says.

00:39:01.731 --> 00:39:05.571
Yogi: She wants to know what does it mean the Deities,

00:39:05.577 --> 00:39:09.527
 different aspects of God.

00:39:09.745 --> 00:39:12.904
See actually in our evolutionary process

00:39:13.683 --> 00:39:18.888
there has been an incarnation one after another.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.519
And like Muhammed Sahab has not said  [Unclear] not been before.

00:39:33.936 --> 00:39:37.022
So at different stages our evolution

00:39:37.392 --> 00:39:40.374
these incarnations came forward

00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:44.447
to lead us into higher awareness, one after another.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.906
Translator Yogi: All of the people are incarnating

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.143
 or only the – if you are elected people?

00:40:02.052 --> 00:40:03.052
No, no,

00:40:03.562 --> 00:40:05.049
you see human beings are different,

00:40:05.074 --> 00:40:07.296
these are the principal.

00:40:07.411 --> 00:40:10.265
You see the principal which incarnates.

00:40:11.086 --> 00:40:14.004
You see the principal, I’m talking about Deities.

00:40:14.511 --> 00:40:17.296
Deities is a principal that incarnates.

00:40:27.096 --> 00:40:29.638
human beings also can’t be God

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.098
but these Deities are.

00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:35.489
They incarnate because thats a principal,

00:40:35.514 --> 00:40:41.862
the principal of incarnation mostly are done by

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.452
the principal of Akbar, means the Virat.

00:40:46.657 --> 00:40:49.874
Translator Yogi: What? Akbar is God.

00:40:49.891 --> 00:40:53.369
Akbar which is, we call it Allahu Akbar, yes.

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.465
Now, so that principal incarnates mostly.

00:41:07.046 --> 00:41:09.727
To lead us in our awareness.

00:41:10.828 --> 00:41:15.189
To lead us further with our awareness.

00:41:21.687 --> 00:41:24.516
Like first it came as a fish, fish.

00:41:28.446 --> 00:41:31.840
Then it came as a turtoise, like that.

00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:35.364
Translator Yogi: The Deities you mean come as a fish and then?

00:41:35.657 --> 00:41:39.560
Then that one fish came out of the water.

00:41:40.152 --> 00:41:41.272
the first fish

00:41:42.758 --> 00:41:45.664
and became a reptile, turtoise.

00:41:46.509 --> 00:41:49.379
That fish was an incarnation.

00:42:02.827 --> 00:42:05.653
So that principle incarnates, one.

00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:11.108
Second is the Mother's principle also incarnates, Mother,

00:42:11.697 --> 00:42:14.830
which we call as Ruh,

00:42:16.018 --> 00:42:17.298
that incarnates.

00:42:18.304 --> 00:42:19.664
Not the complete,

00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:24.868
but the energy of God's desire.

00:42:29.903 --> 00:42:33.080
That principal also incarnates to protect the people

00:42:33.105 --> 00:42:35.614
who are trying to ascend.

00:42:37.414 --> 00:42:40.276
To protect the people who are trying to ascend.

00:42:41.402 --> 00:42:50.179
Yogi: To protect the people who are trying to ascend, to go on the higher as well.

00:42:50.836 --> 00:42:51.836
to prevent

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:55.401
Yogi: To prevent the people from ascending.

00:42:55.415 --> 00:42:57.095
Yogis: To help, help.

00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:00.567
To protect, to protect.

00:43:10.148 --> 00:43:13.987
So, these two mainly incarnate.

00:43:17.753 --> 00:43:25.810
But the Rahim, or Rahim aspect does not incarnate,

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.592
we call it as Shiva.

00:43:36.281 --> 00:43:39.056
And also Karim aspect does not.

00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:57.820
So the Karim aspect also does not.

00:43:57.845 --> 00:44:02.049
The Karim aspect creates the whole universe.

00:44:08.165 --> 00:44:10.919
He is the Creator, He creates this Mother Earth.

00:44:15.224 --> 00:44:22.365
But the Rahim aspect is the, is the principle of the Spirit.

00:44:28.368 --> 00:44:32.828
So, we have these centers,  are

00:44:32.988 --> 00:44:38.032
actually like milestones of our evolution.

00:44:48.516 --> 00:44:52.720
Like all these prophets were here in the void.

00:44:56.288 --> 00:44:58.535
Somewhere on the left, some on the right side.

00:45:00.996 --> 00:45:10.040
Then, the higher and higher  if you go,

00:45:10.214 --> 00:45:17.015
 then here comes the aspect of Akbar as,

00:45:18.167 --> 00:45:21.646
that is Vishnu's aspect comes here as Shri Krishna.

00:45:28.031 --> 00:45:30.860
Before that came as Rama.

00:45:32.976 --> 00:45:36.582
Then in the brain he becomes Virat, means Akbar.

00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:41.332
Means the collectivity.

00:45:43.762 --> 00:45:47.162
Akbar means the whole, everything belongs,

00:45:47.446 --> 00:45:50.123
is a part and parcel of the whole thing.

00:46:02.666 --> 00:46:07.007
So it is the way that these different aspects

00:46:07.032 --> 00:46:11.959
 are and the different aspects one by one,

00:46:11.984 --> 00:46:16.760
He has helped to ascend,

00:46:17.086 --> 00:46:19.528
 for human beings to ascend.

00:46:19.655 --> 00:46:22.269
They are the ones who have prepared the stage.

00:46:35.474 --> 00:46:37.875
For example, if this chakra is catching,

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.933
 if you put your fingers,  this is for Vishuddhi,

00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:42.671
 these two, in the ears,

00:46:42.687 --> 00:46:47.284
and put your head up and say Allahu Akbar sixteen times, then this clears on.

00:46:59.845 --> 00:47:04.769
So, that's how it is and every chakra has some meaning.

00:47:08.282 --> 00:47:12.447
And that one by one you can see through the deities,

00:47:12.472 --> 00:47:15.568
which of course they will tell you all about it in details.

00:47:20.479 --> 00:47:23.119
But suddenly you should not talk about these things,

00:47:23.134 --> 00:47:25.815
because you see Mohammed Sahab

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.915
was so fed up with the way the people were doing

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.763
idolatry and all that,

00:47:32.784 --> 00:47:37.015
that he just thought better to talk about the formless.

00:47:52.172 --> 00:47:57.072
It is like this, when you talk about the flowers,

00:47:58.507 --> 00:47:59.669
 for the honey,

00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:04.451
people started worshipping different flowers.

00:48:14.888 --> 00:48:17.240
worshipping different flowers.

00:48:22.475 --> 00:48:24.146
So he said, alright,

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:25.913
better not talk about the flowers,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.792
because talking about the flowers you don't get the honey.

00:48:40.094 --> 00:48:43.357
So they said, alright, let us talk only about honey.

00:48:45.766 --> 00:48:49.414
 Mohammed Sahab and all these said, honey means formless.

00:48:58.417 --> 00:49:01.529
But even talking about honey is a talk.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.728
You have to become a bee,

00:49:07.753 --> 00:49:10.107
 you have to become a bee to get the honey.

00:49:15.884 --> 00:49:20.071
So you have to get your realization to get your spirit.

00:49:29.295 --> 00:49:30.295
See, this is the point.
