1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,320
Now this futuristic behavior starts in a society where

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,654
people always think of the future.

3
00:00:12,774 --> 00:00:15,695
“What will I do, what am I to do tomorrow,

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,529
what am I to achieve tomorrow?”

5
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:19,649
And all these things, when they start doing

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,320
their attention goes to the right extreme.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,111
Now, in this place we are very dangerously placed,

8
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:30,111
very dangerously placed, when we start looking for the

9
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:38,861
future and the future seeing is a imaginary stuff,

10
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:43,695
is absolutely imaginary, because what you think

11
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:47,986
of the future doesn’t exist. What exists is the present,

12
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:50,986
you have to be in the present not in the future.

13
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:54,899
But people will say you have to be in the present, but how?

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,695
We cannot. Either we are in the past or in the future.

15
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:03,362
Because when the thought wave rises, it comes up and goes down.

16
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:07,445
Another thought wave rises, goes up and comes down.

17
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,320
Now, this thought wave which comes up,

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,903
we go with it but we don’t see it’s going down.

19
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:16,111
Another thought wave that rises, we see that but

20
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,861
don’t see where it goes out.

21
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:20,320
And so we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,861
and we do not know, perhaps we are with the past

23
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,654
or perhaps with the future. But in the center of these two

24
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:30,487
thoughts there is the present and we don’t know

25
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:33,779
how to take our attention there, which is a very difficult thing

26
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:37,669
and just to say that you should be in the center is not possible.

27
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,570
All these things, “You should do this, you should do that,”

28
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,695
is not going to work out unless and until there is light.

29
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:46,695
For example, there is no light in this room and you say,

30
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,362
“Walk straight,” you cannot walk because you can’t see

31
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,037
where is the passage, how to walk.

32
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,150
Even if you order, do whatever you please,

33
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,362
you cannot just walk straight without touching any of these

34
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:59,612
chairs because there is no light, you can’t see.

35
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:02,695
So one has to understand that in the

36
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:05,487
futuristic life when we live and we plan too

37
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:08,320
much for the future, actually what we are doing,

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,093
we are living in an imaginary world.

39
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,779
We have many stories of people who lived in imaginary

40
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:18,487
worlds and how they found that everything was destroyed.

41
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:22,861
And there are people who work it out through their

42
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,654
physical efforts, and when they go into their physical

43
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:29,445
efforts they create another problem for them because

44
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:33,237
they just become physically oriented people.

45
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:35,861
And if you are just physically oriented,

46
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,487
the Spirit gets angry with you.

47
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:41,695
So the right side movement is for the people who

48
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:44,570
are very meticulous, you see, which you can call the people

49
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,570
who are very particular about the time and who are very

50
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,445
firm about things, who are very dry people and who are very

51
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:55,819
straight and they won’t tolerate any nonsense.

52
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,445
One sort of people, you see, that you find normally and

53
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:02,570
that sort of people become a headache and

54
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,770
they are very boring, you see.

55
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,695
You can’t just bear their company,

56
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,321
they can be very boring people.

57
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:10,861
And they give you big lectures about how to be

58
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:14,111
straightforward and how to walk straight absolutely.

59
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,153
In the nature nothing is straight, it all moves so

60
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:23,711
beautifully because the nature is created out of varieties, and variety brings the beauty.

61
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,445
They don’t think of beauty, they don’t think of love,

62
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:29,695
of compassion, nothing. For them it is a very meticulous

63
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:31,986
world and that’s how they live.

64
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:36,570
Such people are developing a big ego within themselves,

65
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,570
as you see there, is a yellow stuff in the head called as ego.

66
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,362
By the action of the left side, emotional side,

67
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:51,362
we develop a superego, but by the action of the right side

68
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:56,612
we develop a ego. Now this ego is not easy to be seen.

69
00:03:56,732 --> 00:03:59,737
Because if you have a superego you have pains

70
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:03,278
in the body, you are a miserable person, you have wrinkles

71
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:06,903
on the face and you look absolutely worn out.

72
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:10,320
But if you have ego then you look so dynamic.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,570
We can say that Hitler was the extreme of this ego business.

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:19,278
And he got into his head that he is some sort of a god

75
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:22,237
incarnation and that he has to save the people,

76
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:25,861
and he was the one who knows about races and everything

77
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:29,986
and he is supposed to save some race.

78
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:33,695
This kind of idea comes from these people who

79
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,903
are right sided, they are very aggressive, they may be very

80
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:42,362
good to talk to, they may be very humble to look at,

81
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,237
could be very good business men, could be anything,

82
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:48,362
but they do not know that they have this Mister Ego

83
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:51,445
coming up on their heads just like a big balloon

84
00:04:51,565 --> 00:04:54,986
and they are floating in the air. The end of ego is stupidity.

85
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,819
You’ll be surprised, the end of ego is stupidity.

86
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:01,237
Such people indulge into all kinds of stupid things,

87
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,487
and they say, “What’s wrong?”

88
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:07,028
For example I’ve known old people behaving in so

89
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:09,819
stupid ways, and they say, “What’s wrong?”

90
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,028
You know, an old man, say of ninety years,

91
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:16,028
Who can’t even walk without a stick, takes to these dances you

92
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,153
do and then he falls down, you see, and

93
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:22,111
he thinks, “what’s wrong?” Like a lady I knew, she was

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:26,153
about eighty-five, she died from a horse falling down.

95
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:29,278
Naturally I mean what else you expect at eighty-five,

96
00:05:29,398 --> 00:05:32,243
that’s what is evident, for a lady of eighty-five she should

97
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:34,601
settle down at home, look after her grandchildren,

98
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,981
maybe she might have great grandchildren, you see.

99
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:40,001
Instead of that why does she want to be twenty-five-year-old

100
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:42,362
lady to climb on a horse?

101
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:46,111
So all such stupid things they do and then they will say,

102
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:49,362
“What’s wrong?” Is nothing wrong in stupidity, what’s wrong?

103
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:55,237
But such people are a nuisance to the society, to others.

104
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:59,111
The people who are superego are troublesome to themselves,

105
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:03,570
but those are egoistical are troublesome to others.

106
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,819
They are all the time correcting others, torturing others,

107
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,737
putting their ideas on to other people, and such people

108
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:13,903
can be very, very successful because nothing

109
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,695
succeeds like success.

110
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:19,278
They go on hammering things into the heads of people,

111
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:21,357
saying, “Now this is true, this is true,”

112
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:24,066
and when you go on saying it, this you suddenly believe,

113
00:06:24,147 --> 00:06:27,737
“Yes, must be so.” And such people are much more dangerous

114
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,819
I would say from the superego type.

115
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,819
But for people who do not know the tricks of the

116
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:41,278
superego they can be very, very, very dangerous because

117
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:45,403
they are very subtle, you cannot see them, they mesmerize,

118
00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:51,153
and they can possess you and they can be very sly, and they can

119
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:54,945
work out all sorts of methods which you are not aware.

120
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:59,737
So it is not easy to choose which is better, which is not better.

121
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:02,482
Both things are wrong to go to extremes,

122
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,549
on the right or to the left.
