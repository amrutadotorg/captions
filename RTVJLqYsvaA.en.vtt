WEBVTT

00:03.270 --> 00:08.404
I could not accommodate all of you in my house then I thought better to come here all of you would fit here!

00:09.040 --> 00:12.899
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis (before India Tour).

00:15.000 --> 00:28.125
We have to understand certain very, very important
things about ourselves and our organisation that is Divine.

00:32.898 --> 00:43.840
Now, in broad lines, I can tell you, not individual
problems and individual things because you are no more individuals now.

00:44.340 --> 00:51.463
You have become part and parcel of the divine Being and you are awakened cells.

00:51.463 --> 01:00.760
And so, in a broad way we must understand what we have to do about it.

01:04.003 --> 01:13.962
First thing, we have to kno that we are Realised souls,

01:13.962 --> 01:29.155
and that you have got Realisation and that you are saints; that you have all the powers that a saint could have.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.960
No saint ever had more powers than you have, as it is, which is manifesting.

01:37.079 --> 01:42.609
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

01:44.099 --> 01:51.399
You’ll be amazed, none of the books which have been written so far have been able to

01:51.399 --> 01:59.950
tell you about the spiritual being that is
within you as you have come to know through

01:59.950 --> 02:01.310
Sahaja Yoga.

02:01.310 --> 02:04.700
One has to accept it.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.729
It is so.

02:06.729 --> 02:16.020
Any one of them, whosoever has written any
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

02:16.020 --> 02:19.860
he could not explain so many things which
you know.

02:19.860 --> 02:29.890
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

02:29.890 --> 02:31.120
or Buddha.

02:31.120 --> 02:38.460
The quality is very high because they are
extremely pure people – purity.

02:38.460 --> 02:45.400
They have achieved individual salvation of
a very high degree.

02:45.400 --> 02:51.170
While you have achieved your collective salvation
better.

02:51.170 --> 02:55.310
But individually they are of a very, very
high quality.

02:55.310 --> 03:01.400
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power,
they had no doubts about God.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.840
They never had any doubts and they were very
dignified.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.950
And they never bothered as to their petty
problems of life.

03:09.950 --> 03:12.420
For them this was too petty to think about.

03:12.420 --> 03:20.450
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much
time over it.

03:20.450 --> 03:30.390
I know we had to do it because, after all,
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

03:30.390 --> 03:40.950
Yoga with our human awareness and then we
got our Realisation.

03:40.950 --> 03:44.450
So the purification time is very, very short.

03:44.450 --> 03:48.300
And while they had such a lot of time to purify
themselves.

03:48.300 --> 03:56.810
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation,
a very pure form of a personality or, you

03:56.810 --> 04:02.250
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely
purest form of incarnation.

04:02.250 --> 04:14.020
But they are there to be our ideals while
what we have done is to become, from human

04:14.020 --> 04:17.430
beings, a prophet.

04:17.430 --> 04:24.039
So you understand both the things very well,
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

04:24.039 --> 04:32.810
are their problems, how they get away from
reality, how they are deluded.

04:32.810 --> 04:37.810
But still we do not use our vibratory power
as we should use.

04:37.810 --> 04:45.090
And this is the point I want to tell you – that
you all have vibratory powers.

04:45.090 --> 04:54.210
When we start using our vibratory powers also
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

04:54.210 --> 04:55.840
have for using this power.

04:55.840 --> 05:07.539
It is the power of the Deities within us and it’s a ritual by which we get their power

05:07.539 --> 05:09.529
working in us.

05:09.529 --> 05:19.590
As you know that people of ancient times did lot of miracles through this power but they

05:19.590 --> 05:21.960
were very dignified people.

05:21.960 --> 05:32.570
There was no frivolousness in their character
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

05:32.570 --> 05:34.689
of no spiritual value.

05:34.689 --> 05:40.430
When you use your vibratory awareness you
should not use them for useless powers like,

05:40.430 --> 05:45.999
for example, going to a cinema and there’s
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

05:45.999 --> 05:47.819
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach
that place.

05:47.819 --> 05:51.710
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

05:51.710 --> 05:57.400
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether you go to a cinema or not.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.210
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, how far you have come in your spirituality.

06:02.210 --> 06:05.680
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

06:05.680 --> 06:12.249
You are a saint, and what saintliness you are achieving within you is the main problem.

06:12.249 --> 06:18.100
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that
you have, has no meaning.

06:18.100 --> 06:21.879
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

06:21.879 --> 06:30.529
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that you are now newly born and you are people

06:30.529 --> 06:33.990
of new awareness and you have to have that
dignity.

06:33.990 --> 06:38.030
I’ll just give an example because I was
discussing with someone today,

06:38.030 --> 06:44.113
that when you give somebody a sort of a bandhan, you just turn your hand like this or like that.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.574
This is not the way it should be done.

06:45.930 --> 06:49.779
Your hands itself are to be respected because these are the hands of a saint.

06:49.779 --> 06:55.569
And all the deities reside on your hands and
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

06:55.569 --> 06:58.139
or anything, you have to use them properly.

06:58.139 --> 07:04.699
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified
to do it.

07:04.699 --> 07:12.270
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be
absolutely avoided.

07:12.270 --> 07:20.599
Then dealing with each other you have to know
that you are all now in the circulation of

07:20.599 --> 07:21.599
Divine Power.

07:21.599 --> 07:26.710
You have to respect each other and really
love each other.

07:26.710 --> 07:30.330
You must respect because you are all saints.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.580
Every saint must respect another saint.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.389
That’s the minimum of minimum.

07:33.389 --> 07:40.120
And if you do not respect each other, your
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

07:40.120 --> 07:41.810
because it’s the collective thing.

07:41.810 --> 07:48.039
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because
your sense of security is your collectivity.

07:48.039 --> 08:00.229
And the love between each other has to be
not only looked after but is to be nourished

08:00.229 --> 08:04.960
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

08:04.960 --> 08:10.389
You should not treat each other as human beings
treat each other.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.389
No!

08:11.389 --> 08:13.300
It’s a precious thing.

08:13.300 --> 08:19.339
And even while talking to anyone very close
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

08:19.339 --> 08:24.080
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise,
it has no meaning.

08:24.080 --> 08:29.219
You must respect your parents much more than
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

08:29.219 --> 08:32.940
Yogis, because they are saints and they are
your parents.

08:32.940 --> 08:38.430
Respect is the keynote of relationship with
each other to begin with.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.210
And respect without love has no meaning.

08:41.210 --> 08:44.630
Respect and love for each other.

08:44.630 --> 08:50.630
Whether somebody is highly placed in life,
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

08:50.630 --> 08:52.600
Yoga it does not matter.

08:52.600 --> 08:59.820
How much you earn, what is your position in
life, where you live is not important.

08:59.820 --> 09:04.140
The main important thing is that we are one
and we are the people who have become now

09:04.140 --> 09:10.570
prophets and we are the ones who have got
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

09:10.570 --> 09:16.530
and such a power has come into us because
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

09:16.530 --> 09:18.690
duty that we should love each other.

09:18.690 --> 09:24.500
And how I respect you?

09:24.500 --> 09:29.200
I need not because you know that there’s
a big gap between you and me.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.480
But I respect you because you are saints.

09:32.480 --> 09:38.900
And where the saints are not respected that country goes to dogs.

09:38.900 --> 09:43.390
So first of all you must learn how to respect
each other.

09:43.390 --> 09:47.900
And that is a very, very important training
we should have.

09:47.900 --> 09:55.940
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

09:55.940 --> 09:59.970
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

09:59.970 --> 10:05.260
But I do not know how you will react to this
one that immediately you start thinking about

10:05.260 --> 10:07.560
people who do not respect you.

10:07.560 --> 10:11.430
Think how many people you do not respect.

10:11.430 --> 10:17.560
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

10:17.560 --> 10:18.890
man does not respect me!

10:18.890 --> 10:19.890
That man does not respect!”

10:19.890 --> 10:24.610
But just think how many people you have not respected yourself.

10:24.610 --> 10:35.210
When I am not here, I am here much more.

10:35.210 --> 10:39.560
I have not been to Australia, and you know how tremendously these people have come up

10:39.560 --> 10:43.060
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

10:43.060 --> 10:49.170
But that has not happened so much here because
I had to work, really labour here.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.490
Not that England is that bad.

10:50.490 --> 10:54.910
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is
around.

10:54.910 --> 10:58.029
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She
can solve them.

10:58.029 --> 11:03.060
” Even small, small problems you bring to
me – it’s all right – but now you are

11:03.060 --> 11:08.810
capable of solving your problems as well as
solving the problems of others.

11:08.810 --> 11:13.910
Unless it is something fundamental you need
not bother about me and you need not also

11:13.910 --> 11:14.910
ask me about it.

11:14.910 --> 11:16.280
You can go ahead with it.

11:16.280 --> 11:24.940
But you must think everything in the terms
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

11:24.940 --> 11:27.260
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

11:27.260 --> 11:29.070
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

11:29.070 --> 11:31.870
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

11:31.870 --> 11:38.520
And fundamentally we have to understand one
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

11:38.520 --> 11:42.950
let others grow with our growth.

11:42.950 --> 11:45.930
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.810
You’ll only grow if you make others grow
with you.

11:48.810 --> 11:51.640
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

11:51.640 --> 11:59.930
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes
into the brains of the people.

11:59.930 --> 12:04.530
It has to go into the heart.

12:04.530 --> 12:09.500
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the
heart; that is the Spirit.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.990
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

12:12.990 --> 12:17.760
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

12:17.760 --> 12:23.810
Some people, I am told, are using their hands
like a weapon and all that.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.780
This is very dangerous!

12:25.780 --> 12:30.720
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.310
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

12:33.310 --> 12:35.930
So don’t try such things.

12:35.930 --> 12:40.720
Some people have a habit of also hitting a
person with the hand like that.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.070
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

12:42.070 --> 12:46.450
But otherwise you should not.

12:46.450 --> 12:47.680
You have to respect.

12:47.680 --> 12:57.390
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

12:57.390 --> 13:03.780
Of course, you are hitting the negativity
in another person, I know that.

13:03.780 --> 13:09.990
But you have no business to do that or to
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

13:09.990 --> 13:10.990
thing.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.720
You will go down very much.

13:13.720 --> 13:20.120
This is a serious thing one must understand.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.540
You have all the powers you know how far to
go.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.310
You must keep to your maryadas.

13:24.310 --> 13:29.920
Don’t go beyond, because these things give
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

13:29.920 --> 13:32.390
which we face always.

13:32.390 --> 13:35.570
Try to improve your language.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.130
Be gentle.

13:37.130 --> 13:41.840
Be very gentle with each other.

13:41.840 --> 13:46.650
I expect that you’ll have many more people
by the time I come.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.240
I expect fantastic things from you.

13:49.240 --> 13:54.170
I don’t know if I should but I have given
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

13:54.170 --> 13:57.690
It is unbelievable.

13:57.690 --> 14:05.860
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you
are specially selected and I have worked with

14:05.860 --> 14:07.410
you for years together.

14:07.410 --> 14:10.720
You have got the tapes in English.

14:10.720 --> 14:15.800
French people, poor things, they don’t have
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

14:15.800 --> 14:21.130
They haven’t got a book in French and they
have big problems of understanding me.

14:21.130 --> 14:27.360
But how dedicated they were, how deep they
are.

14:27.360 --> 14:33.280
Each one of them came and said, “Mother,
I love You very much.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.280
I love You.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.860
” “I have many defects and I offer myself
to You.

14:37.860 --> 14:40.900
Will you accept me?”

14:40.900 --> 14:43.600
All of them said this way.

14:43.600 --> 14:44.600
Just imagine!

14:44.600 --> 14:50.330
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying
all these things to me and the way they were

14:50.330 --> 14:52.700
understanding their defects within themselves.

14:52.700 --> 15:02.290
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

15:02.290 --> 15:05.980
and all these things.

15:05.980 --> 15:13.430
For example, say, one is married – marriages
should be successful.

15:13.430 --> 15:19.450
If your marriage is not successful and happy,
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

15:19.450 --> 15:22.180
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.310
That’s very important.

15:24.310 --> 15:28.150
Marriage is the institution established by
Adi Shakti.

15:28.150 --> 15:30.550
You cannot dishonour it.

15:30.550 --> 15:33.620
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

15:33.620 --> 15:42.570
Then you must also allow the children to be
born to you so that you get great souls coming

15:42.570 --> 15:51.720
down on this earth by which we are giving
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

15:51.720 --> 15:52.930
a very happy life.

15:52.930 --> 15:57.700
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

15:57.700 --> 16:02.750
a trouble with you and they do not prosper
well and they have problems.

16:02.750 --> 16:08.730
So, first of all, create a family of happiness
and joy.

16:08.730 --> 16:13.790
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

16:13.790 --> 16:14.790
life.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.610
It’s absolutely wrong!

16:16.610 --> 16:19.070
Absolutely wrong!

16:19.070 --> 16:24.529
If you cannot make a happy married life in
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

16:24.529 --> 16:26.580
First try in the ashram.

16:26.580 --> 16:27.870
[It’s] worth trying.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.940
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

16:29.940 --> 16:34.040
Because then you understand how you share
your life with others and your married life.

16:34.040 --> 16:38.990
Any such thing like any material thing, like
getting a house or getting this thing, that

16:38.990 --> 16:40.930
thing is not so important.

16:40.930 --> 16:45.760
Your house should be clean within yourself,
your temple of your heart.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.710
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate
money.

16:49.710 --> 16:52.810
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

16:52.810 --> 16:58.883
The real temples which are growing, which are the living temples of living God within us.

16:59.710 --> 17:05.440
So these material things are important up to a point, not more than that.

17:05.440 --> 17:12.582
Most important is not how you are substantiated by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated Sahaja Yoga through.

17:13.180 --> 17:16.780
Many people think, “We should get a good house because we have come to Mataji.

17:16.780 --> 17:19.216
Yes, you do get. You get good jobs. All right.

17:19.216 --> 17:21.656
You get it. You get your financial conditions improved.

17:21.656 --> 17:23.225
All right. Everything happens to you.

17:23.607 --> 17:27.077
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

17:27.250 --> 17:29.850
In the way: how much have you substantiated?

17:29.850 --> 17:33.549
People think sometimes that if they donate money that’s sufficient. It’s not.

17:33.930 --> 17:43.904
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, with your friendship, with your sweet understanding of each other,

17:43.904 --> 17:48.700
enjoyment of each other’s company in the purest form, not with any purpose

17:48.700 --> 17:58.370
or with any intention of getting any low type of joy or low type of happiness from someone

17:58.370 --> 17:59.820
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

17:59.820 --> 18:04.370
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

18:04.370 --> 18:06.940
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

18:06.940 --> 18:11.010
We have to try to be purer and purer.

18:11.010 --> 18:20.448
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole being as you would be.

18:20.448 --> 18:25.218
Your presence itself will show that you are Sahaja Yogis.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.700
You won’t have to certify.

18:26.700 --> 18:32.240
You won’t have to wear some special dresses to say, but people will know from your faces

18:32.240 --> 18:35.180
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

18:35.180 --> 18:39.430
You have to stand back in the last queue.

18:39.430 --> 18:41.680
You should be the people who should look at things.

18:41.680 --> 18:48.350
You should not be the first, unique, to get into the thing first, to getting into the queue first.

18:48.350 --> 18:52.543
No, you are the last because you are with yourself. They are not.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.930
They have not [got] their own securities.

18:54.930 --> 18:57.610
They are trying to find securities in these things.

18:57.610 --> 19:00.450
You have your own securities.

19:00.450 --> 19:09.820
Change, according to the Spirit, all your priorities, and then joy is your own.

19:09.820 --> 19:16.520
I really expect fantastic things from you and I hope you all will join together and

19:16.520 --> 19:21.660
work it out and create something fantastic.

19:21.660 --> 19:26.790
I don’t know how to tell individually about things but as it is I have already spoken

19:26.790 --> 19:32.309
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

19:32.309 --> 19:33.309
thing.

19:33.309 --> 19:34.309
And it’s very speedy.

19:34.309 --> 19:38.560
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

19:38.560 --> 19:39.560
thrown out.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.360
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.830
Those who cannot keep by some method or other,
or [who] get locked up by something or some

19:46.830 --> 19:49.180
misidentification, will drop out.

19:49.180 --> 19:54.280
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.600
It is going to be tremendous in India.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.980
I know these five years are going to be tremendous
in Australia.

19:59.980 --> 20:04.430
England may be, depending on your people putting
up the speed.

20:04.430 --> 20:09.190
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and
you have to understand that – drop out all

20:09.190 --> 20:17.240
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications,
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

20:17.240 --> 20:20.120
that you are British, this, that, all this.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.480
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal
beings.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.480
It’s very important.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.420
The time has come now.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.260
From next year it will start.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.651
So, I wish you a very Happy New Year

20:29.651 --> 20:34.481
and a very, very happy and cheerful Christmas. May God bless you.
