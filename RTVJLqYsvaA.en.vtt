00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.404
I could not accommodate all of you in my house then I thought better to come here all of you would fit here!

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.899
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis (before India Tour).

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:28.125
We have to understand certain very, very important
things about ourselves and our organisation that is Divine.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:43.840
Now, in broad lines, I can tell you, not individual
problems and individual things because you are no more individuals now.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.463
You have become part and parcel of the divine Being and you are awakened cells.

00:00:51.463 --> 00:01:00.760
And so, in a broad way we must understand what we have to do about it.

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:13.962
First thing, we have to kno that we are Realised souls,

00:01:13.962 --> 00:01:29.155
and that you have got Realisation and that you are saints; that you have all the powers that a saint could have.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.960
No saint ever had more powers than you have, as it is, which is manifesting.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.609
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:51.399
You’ll be amazed, none of the books which have been written so far have been able to

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.950
tell you about the spiritual being that is
within you as you have come to know through

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.310
Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.700
One has to accept it.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.729
It is so.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:16.020
Any one of them, whosoever has written any
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.860
he could not explain so many things which
you know.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:29.890
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.120
or Buddha.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.460
The quality is very high because they are
extremely pure people – purity.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.400
They have achieved individual salvation of
a very high degree.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.170
While you have achieved your collective salvation
better.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.310
But individually they are of a very, very
high quality.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.400
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power,
they had no doubts about God.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.840
They never had any doubts and they were very
dignified.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.950
And they never bothered as to their petty
problems of life.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.420
For them this was too petty to think about.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.450
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much
time over it.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.390
I know we had to do it because, after all,
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:40.950
Yoga with our human awareness and then we
got our Realisation.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.450
So the purification time is very, very short.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.300
And while they had such a lot of time to purify
themselves.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:56.810
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation,
a very pure form of a personality or, you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.250
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely
purest form of incarnation.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:14.020
But they are there to be our ideals while
what we have done is to become, from human

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.430
beings, a prophet.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.039
So you understand both the things very well,
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:32.810
are their problems, how they get away from
reality, how they are deluded.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.810
But still we do not use our vibratory power
as we should use.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:45.090
And this is the point I want to tell you – that
you all have vibratory powers.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:54.210
When we start using our vibratory powers also
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.840
have for using this power.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:07.539
It is the power of the Deities within us and it’s a ritual by which we get their power

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.529
working in us.

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:19.590
As you know that people of ancient times did lot of miracles through this power but they

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.960
were very dignified people.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:32.570
There was no frivolousness in their character
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.689
of no spiritual value.

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:40.430
When you use your vibratory awareness you
should not use them for useless powers like,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.999
for example, going to a cinema and there’s
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.819
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach
that place.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.710
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:57.400
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether you go to a cinema or not.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.210
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, how far you have come in your spirituality.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.680
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.249
You are a saint, and what saintliness you are achieving within you is the main problem.

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:18.100
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that
you have, has no meaning.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.879
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:30.529
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that you are now newly born and you are people

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:33.990
of new awareness and you have to have that
dignity.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.030
I’ll just give an example because I was
discussing with someone today,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.113
that when you give somebody a sort of a bandhan, you just turn your hand like this or like that.

00:06:44.113 --> 00:06:45.574
This is not the way it should be done.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.779
Your hands itself are to be respected because these are the hands of a saint.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:55.569
And all the deities reside on your hands and
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.139
or anything, you have to use them properly.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:04.699
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified
to do it.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:12.270
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be
absolutely avoided.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.599
Then dealing with each other you have to know
that you are all now in the circulation of

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:21.599
Divine Power.

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:26.710
You have to respect each other and really
love each other.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.330
You must respect because you are all saints.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.580
Every saint must respect another saint.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.389
That’s the minimum of minimum.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:40.120
And if you do not respect each other, your
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.810
because it’s the collective thing.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:48.039
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because
your sense of security is your collectivity.

00:07:48.039 --> 00:08:00.229
And the love between each other has to be
not only looked after but is to be nourished

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:04.960
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.389
You should not treat each other as human beings
treat each other.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.389
No!

00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:13.300
It’s a precious thing.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.339
And even while talking to anyone very close
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:24.080
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise,
it has no meaning.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.219
You must respect your parents much more than
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:32.940
Yogis, because they are saints and they are
your parents.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.430
Respect is the keynote of relationship with
each other to begin with.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.210
And respect without love has no meaning.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.630
Respect and love for each other.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:50.630
Whether somebody is highly placed in life,
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.600
Yoga it does not matter.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:59.820
How much you earn, what is your position in
life, where you live is not important.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.140
The main important thing is that we are one
and we are the people who have become now

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.570
prophets and we are the ones who have got
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:16.530
and such a power has come into us because
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.690
duty that we should love each other.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:24.500
And how I respect you?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.200
I need not because you know that there’s
a big gap between you and me.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.480
But I respect you because you are saints.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.900
And where the saints are not respected that country goes to dogs.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.390
So first of all you must learn how to respect
each other.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.900
And that is a very, very important training
we should have.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:55.940
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.970
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:05.260
But I do not know how you will react to this
one that immediately you start thinking about

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.560
people who do not respect you.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.430
Think how many people you do not respect.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:17.560
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.890
man does not respect me!

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:19.890
That man does not respect!”

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.610
But just think how many people you have not respected yourself.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:35.210
When I am not here, I am here much more.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.560
I have not been to Australia, and you know how tremendously these people have come up

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.060
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:49.170
But that has not happened so much here because
I had to work, really labour here.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.490
Not that England is that bad.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.910
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is
around.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.029
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She
can solve them.

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:03.060
” Even small, small problems you bring to
me – it’s all right – but now you are

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.810
capable of solving your problems as well as
solving the problems of others.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.910
Unless it is something fundamental you need
not bother about me and you need not also

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.910
ask me about it.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.280
You can go ahead with it.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:24.940
But you must think everything in the terms
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.260
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.070
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.870
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:38.520
And fundamentally we have to understand one
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.950
let others grow with our growth.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.930
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.810
You’ll only grow if you make others grow
with you.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.640
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:59.930
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes
into the brains of the people.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:04.530
It has to go into the heart.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:09.500
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the
heart; that is the Spirit.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.990
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.760
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.810
Some people, I am told, are using their hands
like a weapon and all that.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.780
This is very dangerous!

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.720
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.310
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.930
So don’t try such things.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.720
Some people have a habit of also hitting a
person with the hand like that.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.070
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.450
But otherwise you should not.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:47.680
You have to respect.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:57.390
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:03.780
Of course, you are hitting the negativity
in another person, I know that.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.990
But you have no business to do that or to
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.990
thing.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.720
You will go down very much.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:20.120
This is a serious thing one must understand.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.540
You have all the powers you know how far to
go.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.310
You must keep to your maryadas.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:29.920
Don’t go beyond, because these things give
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.390
which we face always.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.570
Try to improve your language.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.130
Be gentle.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.840
Be very gentle with each other.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.650
I expect that you’ll have many more people
by the time I come.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.240
I expect fantastic things from you.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.170
I don’t know if I should but I have given
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.690
It is unbelievable.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:05.860
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you
are specially selected and I have worked with

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.410
you for years together.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.720
You have got the tapes in English.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.800
French people, poor things, they don’t have
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:21.130
They haven’t got a book in French and they
have big problems of understanding me.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:27.360
But how dedicated they were, how deep they
are.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.280
Each one of them came and said, “Mother,
I love You very much.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280
I love You.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.860
” “I have many defects and I offer myself
to You.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.900
Will you accept me?”

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.600
All of them said this way.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600
Just imagine!

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:50.330
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying
all these things to me and the way they were

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.700
understanding their defects within themselves.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:15:02.290
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.980
and all these things.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:13.430
For example, say, one is married – marriages
should be successful.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:19.450
If your marriage is not successful and happy,
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.180
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.310
That’s very important.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.150
Marriage is the institution established by
Adi Shakti.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.550
You cannot dishonour it.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.620
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:42.570
Then you must also allow the children to be
born to you so that you get great souls coming

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:51.720
down on this earth by which we are giving
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.930
a very happy life.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.700
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.750
a trouble with you and they do not prosper
well and they have problems.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:08.730
So, first of all, create a family of happiness
and joy.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.790
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.790
life.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.610
It’s absolutely wrong!

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.070
Absolutely wrong!

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:24.529
If you cannot make a happy married life in
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:26.580
First try in the ashram.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.870
[It’s] worth trying.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.940
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.040
Because then you understand how you share
your life with others and your married life.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.990
Any such thing like any material thing, like
getting a house or getting this thing, that

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.930
thing is not so important.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.760
Your house should be clean within yourself,
your temple of your heart.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.710
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate
money.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.810
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:58.883
The real temples which are growing, which are the living temples of living God within us.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:05.440
So these material things are important up to a point, not more than that.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.582
Most important is not how you are substantiated by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated Sahaja Yoga through.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.780
Many people think, “We should get a good house because we have come to Mataji.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.216
Yes, you do get. You get good jobs. All right.

00:17:19.216 --> 00:17:21.656
You get it. You get your financial conditions improved.

00:17:21.656 --> 00:17:23.225
All right. Everything happens to you.

00:17:23.607 --> 00:17:27.077
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.850
In the way: how much have you substantiated?

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.549
People think sometimes that if they donate money that’s sufficient. It’s not.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:43.904
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, with your friendship, with your sweet understanding of each other,

00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:48.700
enjoyment of each other’s company in the purest form, not with any purpose

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:58.370
or with any intention of getting any low type of joy or low type of happiness from someone

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.820
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.370
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.940
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.010
We have to try to be purer and purer.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:20.448
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole being as you would be.

00:18:20.448 --> 00:18:25.218
Your presence itself will show that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.700
You won’t have to certify.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.240
You won’t have to wear some special dresses to say, but people will know from your faces

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.180
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.430
You have to stand back in the last queue.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.680
You should be the people who should look at things.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:48.350
You should not be the first, unique, to get into the thing first, to getting into the queue first.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.543
No, you are the last because you are with yourself. They are not.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.930
They have not [got] their own securities.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.610
They are trying to find securities in these things.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:00.450
You have your own securities.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:09.820
Change, according to the Spirit, all your priorities, and then joy is your own.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:16.520
I really expect fantastic things from you and I hope you all will join together and

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.660
work it out and create something fantastic.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.790
I don’t know how to tell individually about things but as it is I have already spoken

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:32.309
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

00:19:32.309 --> 00:19:33.309
thing.

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:34.309
And it’s very speedy.

00:19:34.309 --> 00:19:38.560
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.560
thrown out.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.360
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.830
Those who cannot keep by some method or other,
or [who] get locked up by something or some

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.180
misidentification, will drop out.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:54.280
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.600
It is going to be tremendous in India.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.980
I know these five years are going to be tremendous
in Australia.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:04.430
England may be, depending on your people putting
up the speed.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.190
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and
you have to understand that – drop out all

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:17.240
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications,
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.120
that you are British, this, that, all this.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.480
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal
beings.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480
It’s very important.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.420
The time has come now.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.260
From next year it will start.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.651
So, I wish you a very Happy New Year

00:20:29.651 --> 00:20:34.481
and a very, very happy and cheerful Christmas. May God bless you.
