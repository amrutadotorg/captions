00:00:52.179 --> 00:01:04.091
Today we are going to do puja to Shiva, Shri Shiva.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:16.798
As you know, Shri Shiva is the reflection of Sadashiva within us.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:21.360
I’ve already told about the reflection.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:28.328
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.449
the one who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:42.774
But He is the Father

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:53.407
who is watching each one of His or Her Creation.

00:01:55.344 --> 00:02:08.001
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely, fully strengthening.

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:18.870
There’s no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Adi Shakti,

00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:27.506
but when He finds that in the play of Adi Shakti,

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:38.889
the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her,

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.147
or to spoil Her work,

00:02:42.268 --> 00:02:47.858
then He gets into His wrathful mood,

00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:53.418
and He destroys all such people,

00:02:53.538 --> 00:02:58.342
and maybe, He destroys the whole world.

00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:06.503
On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt,

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:13.814
on the other side, He is the ocean of compassion and joy.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.033
That’s why, when He is reflected within us,

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:23.568
we get our Self-realisation,

00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:27.439
we get the light of our Spirit

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.029
and we get into the ocean of joy.

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:40.476
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:48.791
so those who get Self-realised get the knowledge of the Divine,

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:51.830
which is very subtle,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.308
permeating into every atom and molecule,

00:04:00.428 --> 00:04:07.189
the power of this knowledge is there.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.800
His style is such that, in his compassion,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:26.577
He forgives even very cruel rakshasas,

00:04:26.697 --> 00:04:32.366
if they dedicate themselves to Him.

00:04:32.486 --> 00:04:36.976
Because His compassion has no limits

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:44.150
and sometimes the same people who are blessed by Him

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:52.616
try to trouble the devotees of Adi Shakti

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:57.515
– but it is just to create a drama, an event.

00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:02.811
Unless and until there is some drama, people won’t understand.

00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:08.968
We had to have Ramayana, we had to have Mahabharata,

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:11.719
we had to have Christ being crucified,

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.807
we had to have Mohammed being tortured.

00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:22.970
All that drama was there because without events,

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.635
people don’t remember.

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:30.515
So in the spiritual life of human beings,

00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:33.382
they have seen lots of dramas

00:05:33.502 --> 00:05:42.315
between the blessings of Shiva and the powers of the Adi Shakti.

00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:52.429
As the time has moved, today in the history of spirituality

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:55.757
a great discovery has been made,

00:05:55.877 --> 00:05:59.288
that people can get their realization

00:05:59.408 --> 00:06:03.866
in the collective, en-masse.

00:06:03.986 --> 00:06:06.928
Thousands can get their realization.

00:06:07.048 --> 00:06:12.109
Now, we should know what is that realization we have got,

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.618
what does that mean and what is the culminating point.

00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:21.500
First of all, I have to tell you,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.243
the mind about which we speak and depend upon is a myth.

00:06:28.363 --> 00:06:31.056
There’s nothing like mind.

00:06:31.176 --> 00:06:35.134
Brain is reality, not the mind.

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:41.267
Mind is created by us reacting to outside,

00:06:41.387 --> 00:06:46.386
either we react to conditionings or ego.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:50.454
Thus this mind is created like bubbles

00:06:50.574 --> 00:06:53.299
in the ocean of reality,

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.119
but that’s not reality.

00:06:56.239 --> 00:07:04.111
With this mind, whatever we decide, we know, is very limited,

00:07:04.231 --> 00:07:10.019
illusive and sometimes shocking.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.790
The mind always moves in a linear direction,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.188
and because there’s no reality in it,

00:07:17.308 --> 00:07:20.293
it recoils, and boomerangs.

00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:28.299
Thus all the enterprises, all the projections

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:33.504
so far we have done, it seems, come back to us.

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:38.213
Whatever they discover, comes back to us

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:44.903
as a big destructive power or a very big shock.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.816
So one has to decide what to do,

00:07:48.936 --> 00:07:55.028
how to be out of this trap of our mind.

00:07:55.817 --> 00:07:58.187
Kundalini is the solution.

00:07:58.307 --> 00:08:01.111
When She’s awakened, She takes you,

00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:05.740
with that awakening, She takes you beyond your mind.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.544
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.
