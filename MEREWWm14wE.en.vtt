00:52.179 --> 01:04.091
Today we are going to do puja to Shiva, Shri Shiva.

01:05.239 --> 01:16.798
As you know, Shri Shiva is the reflection of Sadashiva within us.

01:17.166 --> 01:21.360
I’ve already told about the reflection.

01:21.748 --> 01:28.328
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

01:29.660 --> 01:36.449
the one who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

01:37.629 --> 01:42.774
But He is the Father

01:45.498 --> 01:53.407
who is watching each one of His or Her Creation.

01:55.344 --> 02:08.001
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely, fully strengthening.

02:08.954 --> 02:18.870
There’s no doubt in His mind about the capability of the Adi Shakti,

02:18.991 --> 02:27.506
but when He finds that in the play of Adi Shakti,

02:29.388 --> 02:38.889
the people or the world as such, try to disturb Her,

02:39.009 --> 02:42.147
or to spoil Her work,

02:42.268 --> 02:47.858
then He gets into His wrathful mood,

02:48.038 --> 02:53.418
and He destroys all such people,

02:53.538 --> 02:58.342
and maybe, He destroys the whole world.

03:02.878 --> 03:06.503
On one side He’s wrathful, no doubt,

03:06.623 --> 03:13.814
on the other side, He is the ocean of compassion and joy.

03:14.100 --> 03:20.033
That’s why, when He is reflected within us,

03:20.719 --> 03:23.568
we get our Self-realisation,

03:23.688 --> 03:27.439
we get the light of our Spirit

03:27.560 --> 03:35.029
and we get into the ocean of joy.

03:35.149 --> 03:40.476
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

03:40.596 --> 03:48.791
so those who get Self-realised get the knowledge of the Divine,

03:49.236 --> 03:51.830
which is very subtle,

03:51.950 --> 04:00.308
permeating into every atom and molecule,

04:00.428 --> 04:07.189
the power of this knowledge is there.

04:09.760 --> 04:16.800
His style is such that, in his compassion,

04:16.920 --> 04:26.577
He forgives even very cruel rakshasas,

04:26.697 --> 04:32.366
if they dedicate themselves to Him.

04:32.486 --> 04:36.976
Because His compassion has no limits

04:37.096 --> 04:44.150
and sometimes the same people who are blessed by Him

04:44.270 --> 04:52.616
try to trouble the devotees of Adi Shakti

04:52.736 --> 04:57.515
– but it is just to create a drama, an event.

04:57.635 --> 05:02.811
Unless and until there is some drama, people won’t understand.

05:02.931 --> 05:08.968
We had to have Ramayana, we had to have Mahabharata,

05:09.088 --> 05:11.719
we had to have Christ being crucified,

05:11.839 --> 05:15.807
we had to have Mohammed being tortured.

05:16.832 --> 05:22.970
All that drama was there because without events,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.635
people don’t remember.

05:26.244 --> 05:30.515
So in the spiritual life of human beings,

05:30.635 --> 05:33.382
they have seen lots of dramas

05:33.502 --> 05:42.315
between the blessings of Shiva and the powers of the Adi Shakti.

05:46.632 --> 05:52.429
As the time has moved, today in the history of spirituality

05:52.549 --> 05:55.757
a great discovery has been made,

05:55.877 --> 05:59.288
that people can get their realization

05:59.408 --> 06:03.866
in the collective, en-masse.

06:03.986 --> 06:06.928
Thousands can get their realization.

06:07.048 --> 06:12.109
Now, we should know what is that realization we have got,

06:12.229 --> 06:17.618
what does that mean and what is the culminating point.

06:17.738 --> 06:21.500
First of all, I have to tell you,

06:21.620 --> 06:28.243
the mind about which we speak and depend upon is a myth.

06:28.363 --> 06:31.056
There’s nothing like mind.

06:31.176 --> 06:35.134
Brain is reality, not the mind.

06:35.254 --> 06:41.267
Mind is created by us reacting to outside,

06:41.387 --> 06:46.386
either we react to conditionings or ego.

06:46.506 --> 06:50.454
Thus this mind is created like bubbles

06:50.574 --> 06:53.299
in the ocean of reality,

06:53.419 --> 06:56.119
but that’s not reality.

06:56.239 --> 07:04.111
With this mind, whatever we decide, we know, is very limited,

07:04.231 --> 07:10.019
illusive and sometimes shocking.

07:10.139 --> 07:14.790
The mind always moves in a linear direction,

07:14.910 --> 07:17.188
and because there’s no reality in it,

07:17.308 --> 07:20.293
it recoils, and boomerangs.

07:20.413 --> 07:28.299
Thus all the enterprises, all the projections

07:28.419 --> 07:33.504
so far we have done, it seems, come back to us.

07:33.624 --> 07:38.213
Whatever they discover, comes back to us

07:38.333 --> 07:44.903
as a big destructive power or a very big shock.

07:45.879 --> 07:48.816
So one has to decide what to do,

07:48.936 --> 07:55.028
how to be out of this trap of our mind.

07:55.817 --> 07:58.187
Kundalini is the solution.

07:58.307 --> 08:01.111
When She’s awakened, She takes you,

08:01.231 --> 08:05.740
with that awakening, She takes you beyond your mind.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.544
The first thing is to go beyond your mind.
