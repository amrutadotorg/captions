00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:08.199
Since we have come to Cabella, it is
the ten years completed.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.076
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,

00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:20.563
we have been able to progress in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:08:22.463 --> 00:08:30.849
Now, today, we are going to have a Guru
puja.

00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:35.011
As I have said, you all are gurus

00:08:35.212 --> 00:08:42.086
and you want to worship Me as your Guru –
is alright –

00:08:42.287 --> 00:08:46.550
but the main thing one should understand

00:08:51.615 --> 00:09:02.234
that you have become guru, no doubt,
because you have the knowledge.

00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:05.138
You have the Absolute Knowledge,

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:10.449
and so we can say you have become gurus,
no doubt.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:21.492
But one has to understand that you have
reached a state

00:09:21.693 --> 00:09:27.905
where you can raise the Kundalini, you can
give Realisation to others.

00:09:28.106 --> 00:09:33.135
Also you know what is the Absolute
Knowledge.

00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:42.134
To know the Absolute Knowledge is very
important

00:09:42.335 --> 00:09:49.319
and to assimilate is even much more
important.

00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:53.023
Though we know the Absolute Knowledge,

00:09:53.224 --> 00:09:56.143
we cannot assimilate it that well.

00:09:56.326 --> 00:10:04.382
That means we cannot go deep into it.
What is the reason for that?

00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:11.734
We have to realise that we have all come

00:10:11.935 --> 00:10:19.077
out of the heritage that was the animal
kingdom.

00:10:19.278 --> 00:10:23.495
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

00:10:23.696 --> 00:10:29.954
So, there are so many things of the animal
heritage

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:39.318
linger in us: the aggressiveness,
the domination,

00:10:39.853 --> 00:10:52.209
peevishness, fear, grabbing.

00:10:52.941 --> 00:11:02.710
All these are our inheritance and they
are within us, lingering.

00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:06.943
We want to grab things of others;

00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:13.691
not you people, of course not, but people
who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:13.892 --> 00:11:17.668
They first used to grab lands,

00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:28.320
then they started grabbing people, making
them slaves.

00:11:29.444 --> 00:11:33.319
Then they were not satisfied with that,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:41.439
so they were grabbing kingdoms, jewellery
and all these things.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:47.734
So, just to grab. They have no legal right,

00:11:47.935 --> 00:11:50.779
still they would grab.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:58.358
It seems – it seems very funny, it seems
very inhuman,

00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:03.309
but it is there because of our inheritance.

00:12:03.936 --> 00:12:10.323
Now there are so many other things, like
jealousy.

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:14.446
Among animals, there is very little
of that.

00:12:14.647 --> 00:12:20.167
They don’t have jealousies so much as we
have.

00:12:20.368 --> 00:12:28.597
While we have inherited this jealousy
by our own reactions and thinking.

00:12:30.777 --> 00:12:36.863
People get jealous and they want to put
down others.

00:12:37.064 --> 00:12:44.934
If they cannot achieve any height, they
want to bring down the heights of others.

00:12:45.135 --> 00:12:50.546
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings,

00:12:50.747 --> 00:12:55.210
they think whatever is done in the name
of jealousy is alright.

00:12:55.411 --> 00:13:02.479
They become very conscious that we are
lower than another person,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.650
we lack in some talents than another
person,

00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:11.758
and they try to overpower that person

00:13:11.959 --> 00:13:16.655
because of the force of jealousy behind it.

00:13:18.609 --> 00:13:24.169
Now the trouble is, though we are human
beings,

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:32.040
we have inherited so many animal qualities:
like, we are ferocious,

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.739
we are angry, and we get upset, as animals
do.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:46.316
But, additional to that, human beings can
react

00:13:46.517 --> 00:13:51.744
because of their thinking. They think,
they can think,

00:13:51.945 --> 00:14:01.365
and by thinking, all these inherited
properties become perverted.

00:14:01.566 --> 00:14:07.066
Like a person wants to put down another
person:

00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:12.157
then, he doesn’t behave like an animal,
in a straightforward way,

00:14:12.357 --> 00:14:20.033
but he will find out a device and method.
He’ll think it over, how to do it.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:31.643
The main problem with human beings is
that they still have inherited

00:14:31.852 --> 00:14:35.642
very violent temper.

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:42.918
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:46.960
When you see something which you don’t
like,

00:14:47.161 --> 00:14:50.706
which is against your will, maybe something
like that,

00:14:50.906 --> 00:14:54.358
immediately you flare up.

00:14:54.559 --> 00:15:02.596
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor,
they had put a sugar candy.

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:08.158
To sugar candy, they were putting
the matchbox – you see,

00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:12.872
they were using match into it, matchstick.

00:15:13.073 --> 00:15:17.409
It would not take the fire. They tried
and tried, it would not.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:23.136
So I said, “Let Me see what is there.”
So that was a sugar candy!

00:15:23.337 --> 00:15:28.301
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

00:15:28.502 --> 00:15:32.369
So the quality of the person is known
in the same way.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:38.223
If with the slightest provocation, if he
gets into temper and gets annoyed,

00:15:38.424 --> 00:15:44.427
then his quality is not very good as
a guru.

00:15:44.628 --> 00:15:51.826
As a guru, we should not flare up, we
should not get angry,

00:15:52.027 --> 00:15:58.380
we should not try to oppress others.

00:15:58.588 --> 00:16:02.670
“But what can we do then?”, people will
ask.

00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:10.599
We have another method, what we call is
‘love’. Love.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:19.282
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person.

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:28.897
So what happens that it doesn’t give you
any anger

00:16:29.098 --> 00:16:35.849
and the another person, you don’t make him
angry also. But anger begets anger.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:41.484
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort

00:16:41.685 --> 00:16:44.691
because he is afraid of you maybe there.

00:16:44.906 --> 00:16:48.925
But in his heart, he will keep a revenge
in his mind,

00:16:49.126 --> 00:16:53.946
that, “One day, I will show him. Why should
he get angry with me?”

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.865
So, in Sahaja Yoga, please remember

00:16:57.066 --> 00:17:02.042
that love is the only way we can solve
the problem.

00:17:02.243 --> 00:17:06.766
Now, if something goes wrong, say,
in the ashram,

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:10.893
if you get angry with that person, what
will happen?

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:14.774
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.519
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he will -
may realise

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.420
that it was a wrong thing to do. But if he
is a bad Sahaja Yogi,

00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:26.845
not yet fully equipped to understand,

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:37.800
then what he will do, he will just feel
that, “This man has insulted me,

00:17:38.001 --> 00:17:46.274
he has deliberately put me down and all
that, and I should try to take a revenge.”

00:17:47.871 --> 00:17:56.321
Among animals, this activity is very
limited.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.281
I don’t think they believe in revenge,
except for few animals

00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:09.718
they say that, if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite.

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:14.221
It will come back on you. That’s what is
said.

00:18:14.422 --> 00:18:20.229
And this one is something, one quality
of the snake.

00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:26.846
But as we have passed through all these
different categories,

00:18:27.047 --> 00:18:32.653
we might be having some of the qualities
of some of these animals within us.

00:18:32.841 --> 00:18:35.792
We may be even snakes animals.

00:18:35.993 --> 00:18:41.675
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you,

00:18:41.876 --> 00:18:45.588
you’ll remember it all your life, “He has
hurt me,

00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:49.561
so I’ll put him right one day. I’ll take
a revenge!” –

00:18:49.762 --> 00:18:51.985
if there’s a snake within us.

00:18:52.186 --> 00:18:59.087
But now, if there’s a tiger within you: so
you’ll become very ferocious.

00:18:59.288 --> 00:19:03.773
At the smallest thing, you’ll get angry,
lose temper.

00:19:03.974 --> 00:19:12.832
Now, this is not a very good situation,

00:19:13.033 --> 00:19:17.391
that we are still at the level of animals

00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:21.175
and our inheritance is still working in us.

00:19:21.376 --> 00:19:25.177
So we have to keep a-watch, we have to be
good gurus.

00:19:25.378 --> 00:19:28.156
And for good guru, you have to have

00:19:28.357 --> 00:19:37.341
a very peaceful, compassionate, loving
temperament.

00:19:37.542 --> 00:19:40.206
After all,

00:19:50.882 --> 00:19:57.363
one has to understand that people have
this inheritance

00:19:57.564 --> 00:20:04.228
and some people have more, some people
have this, or some people have that.

00:20:04.442 --> 00:20:13.427
For that, if you get angry with that person
it’s not going to help him or help you,

00:20:13.628 --> 00:20:19.321
but if you are loving and compassionate,
and you explain that person

00:20:19.522 --> 00:20:23.135
what is the problem is and what you want
to do,

00:20:23.336 --> 00:20:25.252
I tell you, it will improve.

00:20:25.453 --> 00:20:29.213
He’ll definitely improve and he’ll feel
your love.

00:20:29.414 --> 00:20:37.897
Of course, sometimes, sometimes is
necessary to also forgive such a person.

00:20:38.098 --> 00:20:42.060
Such a person is to be forgiven,
absolutely.

00:20:42.261 --> 00:20:45.722
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs,

00:20:45.923 --> 00:20:48.322
all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

00:20:48.523 --> 00:20:52.316
and he goes on still with the same.
It doesn’t mean that.

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:58.575
‘Forgiven’ means ‘forgotten’. Such and such
a person has been misbehaving,

00:20:58.776 --> 00:21:02.885
so just forget. Forget it. Completely
forget it!

00:21:03.086 --> 00:21:07.444
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja
Yogi guru.

00:21:07.645 --> 00:21:11.099
I must say other gurus were not like that.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:19.131
They were absolutely, I would say,
extremely hot-tempered

00:21:19.332 --> 00:21:23.556
and they used to lose temper on people.

00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:30.978
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them,

00:21:31.264 --> 00:21:35.075
and with this kindness You cannot create
good people.

00:21:35.276 --> 00:21:42.124
I have had enough of it!”, he said. “I had
made two people into gurus.

00:21:42.325 --> 00:21:47.279
And one of them got lost in the money.”

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.516
“Alright, what happened to the second?”

00:21:49.716 --> 00:21:54.470
“And second one got lost in the women.”

00:21:54.671 --> 00:22:00.722
So, I said, “Now it’s alright, if they are
lost, they are lost.

00:22:00.923 --> 00:22:04.395
But if you can revive them with your love,
affection

00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:08.801
and kindness, better get around them.”

00:22:09.002 --> 00:22:15.073
So, the one who was lost…

00:22:17.472 --> 00:22:22.809
[I think if you open that door, people
sitting outside can also hear Me.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.983
So who are those sitting outside?

00:22:30.543 --> 00:22:36.947
Open it fully. Of course!

00:23:01.768 --> 00:23:04.165
Good.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.434
Let them move this side.

00:23:35.718 --> 00:23:38.861
Now is better.]

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.668
So as a guru, you must conclude

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:57.350
that they are still lingering with their
inheritance.

00:23:57.551 --> 00:24:05.476
But the second problem is much worse
because human beings can think.

00:24:06.095 --> 00:24:10.773
Of course, animals also think, but it is
always conditioning.

00:24:10.945 --> 00:24:14.681
Whatever conditioning they have,
accordingly they behave.

00:24:14.882 --> 00:24:21.908
But they don’t have ego, that kind,
as human beings have developed.

00:24:22.109 --> 00:24:28.730
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

00:24:28.984 --> 00:24:34.320
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that,

00:24:34.345 --> 00:24:38.546
“We have done so much! We have worked
so hard

00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:41.217
to achieve this state.

00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:44.116
And why should I give realization to others."

00:24:45.344 --> 00:24:52.336
Or, if they have got Realisation, then,

00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:56.559
“What have they done? Why should they
get Realisation?”

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:03.989
It’s become a comparison between their
own state, and how they have achieved it,

00:25:04.189 --> 00:25:07.299
and how others have to achieve it.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:20.186
So they make all kinds of different
torturing, troubling maneuvers.

00:25:20.387 --> 00:25:30.878
For example, they may make the disciple
stand on his head,

00:25:31.079 --> 00:25:35.813
give his family up, do this, do that.

00:25:36.014 --> 00:25:39.241
They’ll beat the - they can beat also.

00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:45.048
They will make him stay in the water
for a long time.

00:25:45.249 --> 00:25:51.884
Make him stand on the one feet. Like this
they punish.

00:25:52.085 --> 00:25:59.123
And the worse comes to worse,

00:25:59.324 --> 00:26:06.035
they may beat with sticks or with stones.
They are like that.

00:26:06.236 --> 00:26:10.480
They don’t want to talk. They don’t want
to understand

00:26:10.656 --> 00:26:13.499
what the another person has to say,

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:19.800
or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

00:26:21.603 --> 00:26:27.860
All this anger and all these things might
have been alright before,

00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:32.929
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you
must know it is not necessary.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:42.085
It is not at all necessary to give any
physical punishment to your disciples.

00:26:42.395 --> 00:26:48.342
Now, also the mental punishment to your
disciples should not be given.

00:26:48.551 --> 00:26:54.348
Like people start saying all kinds
of things to their disciples.

00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:58.463
Like, say - I’m saying, say there’s
a leader,

00:26:58.664 --> 00:27:03.390
and the leader finds something wrong
with the disciple,

00:27:03.591 --> 00:27:07.473
then he goes on saying, “Now, you are like
this, your father was like this,

00:27:07.674 --> 00:27:11.128
your grandfather was like this, your
great-grandfather was like this

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:17.013
and you are also like this!” Or some sort
of thing that will hurt him.

00:27:17.214 --> 00:27:22.201
By hurting a person, you are not going
to help.

00:27:22.402 --> 00:27:26.860
Supposing, while walking you are hurt,
you can’t walk.

00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:34.843
In your spiritual ascent also, if you are
hurt, you cannot go ahead.

00:27:35.044 --> 00:27:39.236
So not to hurt people is very important.

00:27:39.437 --> 00:27:44.790
Once you go on hurting others, then you
are not a good guru.

00:27:44.991 --> 00:27:54.519
You are not a one who is really being kind
and understanding of the disciple.

00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:58.654
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a different thing
altogether.

00:27:58.855 --> 00:28:04.081
Because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga
without doing any kind of penance,

00:28:04.281 --> 00:28:12.576
any kind of guilty consciousness,
confessions, anything. Nothing!

00:28:12.866 --> 00:28:17.543
As you are, you got your Realisation.

00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:21.787
Nobody had to stand on their heads,
give up their husbands, wives,

00:28:21.988 --> 00:28:25.285
their families, this thing – nothing
of that kind.

00:28:25.486 --> 00:28:29.179
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:36.854
whatever conditions you are, you are given
Realisation – is a fact.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.248
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:28:39.449 --> 00:28:43.194
You don’t have to exert yourself. Don’t
have to do anything.

00:28:43.394 --> 00:28:48.741
Just you get it, sitting down, wherever
you are.

00:28:49.185 --> 00:28:54.319
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:59.611
that you have a power of love,
of compassion.

00:28:59.812 --> 00:29:04.971
Out of your love you have given Realisation
to people. We never realise that.

00:29:05.172 --> 00:29:08.648
Supposing we are anxious to give
Realisation to people,

00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:13.273
we want to go to the villages and work
there, and give them Realisation.

00:29:13.474 --> 00:29:16.037
Why? Why do we do it?

00:29:16.253 --> 00:29:21.273
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

00:29:21.473 --> 00:29:26.572
but just out of the love that is within
your heart, that you feel,

00:29:26.773 --> 00:29:31.412
“Why am I enjoying everything? Why others
are not enjoying?”

00:29:31.613 --> 00:29:39.982
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realisation.

00:29:40.183 --> 00:29:43.318
Now you have become a greater human being

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.174
and you feel concerned - others are getting
ruined,

00:29:47.375 --> 00:29:51.053
they are going on a wrong path, they are
doing wrong things,

00:29:51.254 --> 00:29:59.412
and that makes you feel very, very upset
and you want to help them.

00:30:00.804 --> 00:30:05.959
And this understanding, once you have, then
you will know how to deal

00:30:06.128 --> 00:30:13.658
with the person with whom you have
to behave like a guru.

00:30:14.532 --> 00:30:21.790
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:27.279
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they are committing.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.764
But that too in a such a soft manner

00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:39.304
that a person doesn’t get any shock out
of that.

00:30:40.399 --> 00:30:50.622
All this thing of attachments also: now,
somebody has too much attachment,

00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:56.932
say, for the family, for the wife, for
the husband, children or something.

00:30:57.133 --> 00:31:04.386
And once they come to Sahaj Yog, still they
have the same amount of attachment –

00:31:04.587 --> 00:31:07.609
alright, doesn’t matter.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:11.513
But how far they will go with that
attachment,

00:31:11.714 --> 00:31:18.942
how long it will continue, is the point.
You should be detached.

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:25.963
If I say, you cannot be. It’s a state. It’s
a state of mind when you are detached.

00:31:26.164 --> 00:31:30.416
But when it comes to doing something
for them,

00:31:30.617 --> 00:31:36.880
you will go all out to help them. But you
are not an attached person.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:41.899
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.892
Attached person is always worried about
the other person,

00:31:47.093 --> 00:31:53.378
goes on thinking about the other person,
cannot think of Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:57.136
only think of the people with whom he is
attached.

00:31:57.337 --> 00:32:00.280
Then he is very sensitive. You can’t say
anything

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:05.023
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise
he jumps.

00:32:05.224 --> 00:32:11.554
Attachment is also with the name that
he has.

00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:16.204
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing,

00:32:16.405 --> 00:32:21.631
or some big position, then what does he do?

00:32:21.832 --> 00:32:26.561
You can’t challenge him any way.

00:32:26.762 --> 00:32:30.810
You cannot, by any words you can challenge
him,

00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:33.801
because he is so identified with that.

00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:40.909
He thinks he is a big person who has
achieved such a lot of positions in life.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:53.545
He’s so much attached that he wants
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

00:32:53.746 --> 00:33:04.774
Now, which is the way you can solve that
problem?

00:33:06.633 --> 00:33:14.941
Supposing somebody is very much attached
to his wife, say, for example:

00:33:15.142 --> 00:33:20.630
then you should not discuss and argue with
that person, not at all,

00:33:20.831 --> 00:33:27.076
because he is still coming up slowly,
slowly, up to this stage.

00:33:27.277 --> 00:33:33.722
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:33.923 --> 00:33:40.500
So what do you have to do? If he is
attached to his wife, let it be.

00:33:41.934 --> 00:33:47.535
But the Divine will work it out, and he
will realise

00:33:47.736 --> 00:33:56.248
that what he has been thinking, doing and
taking decisions is all wrong.

00:33:56.601 --> 00:34:01.872
And once he discovered it himself, then
he will get detached.

00:34:02.072 --> 00:34:06.340
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out,

00:34:06.541 --> 00:34:11.565
it will never work out. So you must
understand

00:34:11.766 --> 00:34:19.494
that, as human beings, whatever we were,
also as Sahaja Yogis we have problems,

00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:25.214
and these should be slowly, slowly, should
be dissolved.

00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:28.976
Not by argument, not by saying things,

00:34:29.177 --> 00:34:38.206
but by love and compassion. If you have
love for a person -

00:34:38.817 --> 00:34:44.522
you’ll be amazed, ninety-nine percent
people value love.

00:34:45.562 --> 00:34:49.578
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

00:34:49.779 --> 00:34:53.758
First is his inheritance, second is he
thinks

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:57.533
and thirdly that he values love.

00:34:57.734 --> 00:35:03.855
Anybody who loves, the another person
values that love,

00:35:04.056 --> 00:35:13.253
because he thinks that, “This particular
person is loving me, not my wealth,

00:35:13.454 --> 00:35:18.483
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he
is loving me!”

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:26.056
And this idea of love, this is something
that will get him

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:31.565
completely detached from that person,
easily. How?

00:35:31.765 --> 00:35:36.266
Now, it looks very funny that, if you like
somebody,

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:43.228
if you love somebody, and then you should
get detached.

00:35:43.429 --> 00:35:47.087
Is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:47.288 --> 00:35:53.138
In Sahaja Yoga, your state of mind is such

00:35:53.338 --> 00:36:03.778
that you are absolutely detached and
absolutely attached. How?

00:36:03.979 --> 00:36:17.325
For example, now, say, I have My daughter.
So I’m detached.

00:36:17.526 --> 00:36:21.853
I never telephone to her, I’m never
bothered about her.

00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:26.488
Because in Sahaja Yoga you know how is
that person.

00:36:26.688 --> 00:36:29.727
If the vibrations are alright, why should
you telephone?

00:36:29.928 --> 00:36:33.084
Why should you talk to her? Why should you
ask for anything?

00:36:33.285 --> 00:36:38.611
No need. Only on vibrations you’ll know
how the person is.

00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:42.719
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

00:36:42.888 --> 00:36:47.941
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

00:36:48.142 --> 00:36:52.235
or are indicating something serious about
that person,

00:36:52.436 --> 00:37:01.095
what you will do you’ll put full attention
to that. Full attention.

00:37:01.296 --> 00:37:06.010
You put attention, but not attachment.

00:37:06.653 --> 00:37:09.940
So the attachment doesn’t solve
the problem.

00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:13.642
What solves the problem is attention.

00:37:13.843 --> 00:37:21.472
But when you are not detached, then your
attention is attached attention.

00:37:21.673 --> 00:37:27.848
It’s an attention that is not available
to everyone,

00:37:28.049 --> 00:37:31.746
an attention that gets stuck, absolutely
stuck

00:37:31.947 --> 00:37:38.224
into that person with whom you are
identified. You try to understand.

00:37:38.424 --> 00:37:45.954
So to be identified with someone is not
actually, what we can say,

00:37:46.155 --> 00:37:50.040
paying attention to that person.

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:53.649
And then your attention will work.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.284
If you are of that level, whenever you
put attention

00:37:57.485 --> 00:38:02.929
to that particular person who needs your
attention, it will work out.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.039
But if you are all the time wasting your
attention on a person

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.052
because you are attached to that person,

00:38:10.253 --> 00:38:15.534
your attention will be tired, it won’t work
out.

00:38:15.735 --> 00:38:23.990
It’s a big – I should say – paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

00:38:24.191 --> 00:38:27.827
then your attention doesn’t work out.

00:38:28.028 --> 00:38:32.419
And if you are not attached to that person,
you do everything else.

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:34.785
Now, You - I have to give lecture, alright,
I’m giving lecture,

00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:38.745
then I have to do some cooking, I’ll do
cooking; this, that, that and that.

00:38:38.946 --> 00:38:42.786
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person,

00:38:42.986 --> 00:38:49.754
all the time you want to have connection
with that person, it’s not necessary.

00:38:49.955 --> 00:38:55.195
That person is alright. What is there to be
so much worried about that person?

00:38:55.395 --> 00:38:58.375
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

00:38:58.575 --> 00:39:00.652
you have to raise Kundalini of so many -

00:39:00.852 --> 00:39:07.051
now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, is not a very good thing.

00:39:07.252 --> 00:39:12.710
By that kind of attachment, your attention
also becomes

00:39:12.911 --> 00:39:19.140
useless, absolutely useless. So let
the attention be free.

00:39:19.341 --> 00:39:26.677
Attention should not be bound by your
attachments.

00:39:26.878 --> 00:39:30.686
Attention should be absolutely free,

00:39:30.887 --> 00:39:37.577
so it works automatically, automatically.

00:39:37.778 --> 00:39:42.430
And you will be amazed, even if you do not
pay attention,

00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:45.538
the attention will work it (out).

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:51.183
It is such a great thing to have this
spiritual attention,

00:39:51.384 --> 00:39:55.725
which is nothing but love. It will just
act.

00:39:55.925 --> 00:40:00.353
You’ll be amazed how it acts.

00:40:00.645 --> 00:40:05.094
It’s another world I’m talking about, not
this mundane world,

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:10.500
but something higher, where your attention
works,

00:40:10.701 --> 00:40:14.973
and works so beautifully that you are
amazed how it has worked.

00:40:15.174 --> 00:40:19.455
But you should not bound it by your
attachments.

00:40:19.656 --> 00:40:23.289
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere -

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:29.308
only the people who are attached to you,
or you are attached to those persons.

00:40:29.728 --> 00:40:37.073
That’s why identification is not the way
a guru should work it out.

00:40:43.598 --> 00:40:53.356
Now, there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

00:40:53.557 --> 00:40:56.904
He thinks, “You see, he is the best and he
should be encouraged

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:05.735
and should be given all the possible help.”
But that’s not going to help.

00:41:05.936 --> 00:41:09.501
What, on the contrary, he should say is,
“This is already a good fellow.

00:41:09.702 --> 00:41:13.255
He has risen very high. He’s gone very
deep.

00:41:13.455 --> 00:41:17.488
So pay attention to those who are not
so good

00:41:17.689 --> 00:41:23.967
and talk to them about it, that: “You have
to come up.” In a very sweet manner.

00:41:24.168 --> 00:41:29.740
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there,

00:41:29.941 --> 00:41:36.012
or who are still struggling. You have
to understand them.

00:41:36.213 --> 00:41:41.393
You have to notice: What are they doing?

00:41:41.593 --> 00:41:49.102
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

00:41:49.303 --> 00:41:54.816
What is the problem? Why the Divine is
not flowing through them?

00:41:55.017 --> 00:42:01.430
And you’ll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention –

00:42:01.607 --> 00:42:06.596
is because it is focused on someone
all the time,

00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:12.121
and they feel it is their responsibility
that it should be focused.

00:42:12.322 --> 00:42:19.624
It’s just to give, you see, an explanation.
It’s just an explanation to say that

00:42:19.825 --> 00:42:24.873
“You see, naturally, I have to be worried
about this and worried about that!”

00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:28.092
It’s just an explanation.

00:42:28.293 --> 00:42:33.120
But if you really don’t fix your attention

00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:36.595
to one person or ten persons only,

00:42:36.796 --> 00:42:42.749
then your attention looks after the whole
world.

00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:53.360
It receives all the information and also
it gives

00:42:53.560 --> 00:43:00.763
all the information what is to be done
to correct that situation.

00:43:00.964 --> 00:43:05.818
So one has to rise into that state where
you do not get angry,

00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:10.827
annoyed, upset. No, not at all.

00:43:11.028 --> 00:43:18.302
What happens to you, that you see
a situation

00:43:18.503 --> 00:43:23.624
and in that you are not involved.

00:43:23.825 --> 00:43:28.063
You see the situation and you are away
from it.

00:43:28.264 --> 00:43:32.493
Then you can solve that problem better.

00:43:32.694 --> 00:43:40.190
But if you are part and parcel of that
problem, then you cannot solve.

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:47.186
It’s like this, I was telling, that those
who are fighting, say,

00:43:49.265 --> 00:43:52.241
cannot solve the problem.

00:43:52.442 --> 00:44:00.032
But a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

00:44:00.233 --> 00:44:10.310
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that, if you are identified,

00:44:10.511 --> 00:44:21.725
if you are involved with one person or with
one kind of a thing, then you are lost.

00:44:23.458 --> 00:44:27.144
So our attention has to be always free

00:44:27.345 --> 00:44:32.792
and can be applied widely, wherever needed.

00:44:32.993 --> 00:44:38.693
That is the state one has to reach. If you
reach that state of mind, is -

00:44:38.894 --> 00:44:44.429
not I’m saying you can do anything about
it, it’s just a state of mind.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:51.947
Now, how do we do that? Only through
introspection.

00:44:53.668 --> 00:44:57.407
Through introspection you will understand

00:44:57.608 --> 00:45:04.195
that you need help to solve your problems.

00:45:04.396 --> 00:45:10.298
Firstly, the problem is how to face
yourself,

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:17.905
because you are little bit shy or maybe
nervous about it.

00:45:18.189 --> 00:45:29.218
As the time comes, you’ll be amazed that
this nervousness has no meaning at all.

00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:41.566
When you try to be deliberate about it,
then it won’t work out,

00:45:41.767 --> 00:45:45.668
but if you are sahaj it will work out.

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:51.056
So we come to the second point, apart
from the attention,

00:45:51.257 --> 00:45:57.023
that we should leave everything into
the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:45:57.224 --> 00:46:00.748
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:05.246
“This is the problem. Let Paramchaitanya
solve the problem.

00:46:05.447 --> 00:46:09.822
We are not bothered!” So a detachment
comes in.

00:46:10.023 --> 00:46:14.630
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve.

00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:19.141
So you are not in it, you are away from it.

00:46:19.342 --> 00:46:24.629
Very, very simple things are there, that
if you understand

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:31.933
that we suffer because everybody feels
responsible for us.

00:46:32.134 --> 00:46:39.688
Everybody thinks they are responsible,
they have to do this responsibility for us.

00:46:39.889 --> 00:46:42.488
Somebody says, this responsibility he has
to do.

00:46:42.689 --> 00:46:46.646
All these things are worrying them and that
is the reason

00:46:46.847 --> 00:46:51.332
today we have a very complex society.

00:46:51.533 --> 00:46:55.309
They are suffering from all kinds
of diseases,

00:46:55.510 --> 00:47:00.669
in which only thinking is responsible.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.794
By this thinking all the time – thinking
about one person,

00:47:03.995 --> 00:47:08.562
thinking about one problem – you reach
nowhere.

00:47:08.763 --> 00:47:14.071
At that moment, what you have to do is
to leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

00:47:14.272 --> 00:47:21.249
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage,

00:47:27.232 --> 00:47:33.808
It will solve the problem. Now I will tell
you one thing, an experience:

00:47:34.009 --> 00:47:38.248
this time I was in America and we wanted
to have a puja there.

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:45.149
So I said, “Alright, let them come for
the puja. It’s nice if they want to come.”

00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:50.252
Then they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to bring presents for you, for the puja,

00:47:50.453 --> 00:47:57.064
so how can we bring the presents?” I said,
“It’s very simple: don’t bring!”.

00:47:57.265 --> 00:48:01.424
But they wouldn’t listen to that. They
said, “We’ll have to bring,

00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:06.022
and the customs will trouble us and do
this and do that.”

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:10.874
So there was only one building ahead,

00:48:11.075 --> 00:48:18.672
there was another building, where they were
having a liquidation sale.

00:48:18.873 --> 00:48:22.446
I said, “This is something nice! One can
have a look at it.”

00:48:22.647 --> 00:48:28.603
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable!

00:48:28.804 --> 00:48:33.613
Very, very expensive things for throw-away
prices.

00:48:33.814 --> 00:48:36.330
I was amazed how it is there.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:39.999
So I told them, “I can purchase all these
things. I’ll pay you.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.039
But you bring all these things
to Canajoharie.”

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:47.352
They agreed, “Alright, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

00:48:47.553 --> 00:48:52.628
And they brought all the things, all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:59.758
We had no problem of customs or anything.
I paid them there.

00:49:01.951 --> 00:49:06.504
How, you see, things can be improved,

00:49:06.705 --> 00:49:19.373
by understanding what is the most important
thing is to love.

00:49:19.574 --> 00:49:25.392
But love is truth and truth is love.

00:49:25.593 --> 00:49:31.577
If you have love for somebody, genuine
love,

00:49:31.778 --> 00:49:39.245
then anything you want to do with that
person will be absolutely obvious

00:49:39.445 --> 00:49:43.335
because it will be truthful.

00:49:43.908 --> 00:49:48.902
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

00:49:49.103 --> 00:49:53.262
because it is absolutely truthful.

00:49:53.463 --> 00:49:56.623
So when you are dealing with somebody,
also,

00:49:56.824 --> 00:50:00.120
you should be extremely truthful.

00:50:00.321 --> 00:50:04.947
Of course, you need not say things that
will hurt him,

00:50:05.124 --> 00:50:10.007
but you must use such ways and methods

00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:15.125
that will not, in any way, hurt the other
person -

00:50:15.326 --> 00:50:19.405
which will have an effect on that person.

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:24.980
So this kind of a gurus we need now,
very much, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:28.382
because Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

00:50:28.583 --> 00:50:35.729
So first of all, our temper has to be
brought into proper shape.

00:50:35.938 --> 00:50:40.436
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru, has no business

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:48.103
to lose temper, at all, on any point
whatsoever.

00:50:48.521 --> 00:50:54.806
If they can really do that much, it will
save our,

00:50:55.007 --> 00:51:02.769
I mean, so much of worry, so much
of problems, so much of mess we create.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:11.620
All this can be solved very easily, but
first we must have pure love in our heart,

00:51:11.821 --> 00:51:16.367
not love out of some gain or out of some
sort of a reward,

00:51:16.567 --> 00:51:20.896
but pure love if we have, then we can work
it out,

00:51:21.097 --> 00:51:26.240
very easily, anything that you want to do.

00:51:26.441 --> 00:51:33.256
This is a very lengthy thing which can
go on forever

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:39.563
because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

00:51:39.764 --> 00:51:44.189
and why they are gurus. It’s very
important,

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.937
very important position that they are
gurus.

00:51:48.145 --> 00:51:53.962
And they should use that position for
exhibiting

00:51:54.163 --> 00:51:57.855
tremendous understanding of their
disciples,

00:51:58.056 --> 00:52:05.955
and also their purpose, it should be
clear-cut.

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:08.334
People should not doubt him,

00:52:08.535 --> 00:52:12.868
should not think, “Why he is doing such
and such things?”

00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:20.199
It should not be a mystery, but it should
be absolutely clear-cut.

00:52:21.293 --> 00:52:26.282
All these things I’m telling you today,
because today

00:52:26.483 --> 00:52:33.278
we have completed ten - our ten years
of stay in Cabella.

00:52:33.479 --> 00:52:36.743
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me,

00:52:36.944 --> 00:52:41.462
it has brought forth lots of people
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:41.663 --> 00:52:44.306
I tell you – very lots of people.

00:52:44.507 --> 00:52:47.868
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it

00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:51.263
and said, “Where are You going to live?”
and all that.

00:52:51.463 --> 00:52:57.359
But here only it has worked, and that
should be accepted

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:10.422
as a very good indication that Sahaja Yoga
does miraculous things – miraculous.

00:53:10.585 --> 00:53:17.502
But the foremost thing is you must know
vibrations.

00:53:17.764 --> 00:53:21.061
If you don’t know about vibrations then you
can’t do it.

00:53:21.262 --> 00:53:24.082
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me,

00:53:24.283 --> 00:53:27.657
“Mother, very lonely place, there are
mafias around,

00:53:27.858 --> 00:53:33.782
they have only six, seven houses there.
Where are You going? What is this?”.

00:53:33.983 --> 00:53:38.553
They all warned Me. So I came here

00:53:38.754 --> 00:53:41.214
and immediately I told the mayor,
“I’m going to buy it

00:53:41.415 --> 00:53:44.511
and tomorrow I’ll pay you the money.”

00:53:44.712 --> 00:53:50.283
He was surprised, how can I do that.

00:53:50.484 --> 00:53:56.859
I said, “Don’t worry! Perfectly alright”.
On vibrations it worked.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:03.023
On vibrations I decided that this is
a wonderful place

00:54:03.224 --> 00:54:09.594
and vibrations helped Me so much that time;
though everybody discouraged Me

00:54:09.795 --> 00:54:14.191
and everybody gave Me a very big picture,
horrible one.

00:54:14.392 --> 00:54:20.272
But still, where is the mafia now?
It’s gone, finished.

00:54:23.072 --> 00:54:28.450
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:36.640
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

00:54:36.828 --> 00:54:42.658
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

00:54:42.859 --> 00:54:47.793
your particular ideas about particular
things,

00:54:47.994 --> 00:54:54.014
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

00:54:54.996 --> 00:54:59.444
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

00:54:59.645 --> 00:55:03.040
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

00:55:03.241 --> 00:55:09.849
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:15.949
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:22.381
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

00:55:22.582 --> 00:55:27.024
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

00:55:27.225 --> 00:55:34.740
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

00:55:34.941 --> 00:55:41.138
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

00:55:41.339 --> 00:55:45.311
It emits and creates a path for you,

00:55:45.512 --> 00:55:50.073
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

00:55:50.274 --> 00:55:54.581
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

00:55:54.782 --> 00:55:59.560
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:04.189
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

00:56:04.389 --> 00:56:11.786
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

00:56:11.987 --> 00:56:15.202
May God bless you all.

00:56:29.437 --> 00:56:34.312
There’s one thing is important
to understand,

00:56:34.513 --> 00:56:38.386
that you should not go to extremes
of everything –

00:56:38.587 --> 00:56:40.976
which is also a human quality.

00:56:41.176 --> 00:56:46.180
For example, if they are rational, they
go on rationalising everything,

00:56:46.381 --> 00:56:51.593
“I can’t do this, I can’t do that,”
something like that, goes on.

00:56:51.794 --> 00:56:56.302
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

00:56:56.503 --> 00:56:59.854
and they become so emotional that they
start doing wrong things

00:57:00.055 --> 00:57:06.869
in the name of emotionality. You have
to overcome these two things.

00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:10.799
If you have not overcome that, what’s
the use?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.357
What’s the use of calling yourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

00:57:13.558 --> 00:57:17.316
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

00:57:17.517 --> 00:57:22.147
Going to the extremes must be avoided.
Keep a-watch upon yourself.

00:57:22.348 --> 00:57:26.400
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out.

00:57:26.601 --> 00:57:31.221
You might develop cancer, develop very
horrible diseases on one side,

00:57:31.422 --> 00:57:35.245
and on the other side you might become
a very rational person

00:57:35.446 --> 00:57:39.386
and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

00:57:39.587 --> 00:57:45.899
So you have to keep the balance
all the time.

00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:51.018
And with that balance - like, somebody
is a Sahaja Yogini

00:57:51.219 --> 00:57:53.481
and she has done something very wrong,

00:57:53.682 --> 00:57:56.661
then you should not become emotionally
attached,

00:57:56.862 --> 00:57:59.382
“Oh, Mother, what is it? We should forgive
her.”

00:57:59.583 --> 00:58:10.586
No. You tell her that, “You must improve
your vibrations and must come to balance.

00:58:10.786 --> 00:58:18.450
And once you are in balance, then I will –
I will consider your case.

00:58:18.651 --> 00:58:23.546
Then I will say it is so or not.” But if he
has no balance,

00:58:23.747 --> 00:58:27.955
he goes into rationality, he goes into
emotional things -

00:58:28.156 --> 00:58:32.369
and this emotional business can take you
to any, any nonsensical thing,

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:38.129
as it is a psychological case. And one
can go into very, very wrong things

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:42.220
that they are doing out of this emotional
thing;

00:58:42.421 --> 00:58:49.748
you see, like even singing songs that are
neurotic, or anything, you see.

00:58:49.958 --> 00:58:53.323
All this emotional thing can take you
anywhere.

00:58:53.503 --> 00:58:58.090
So to be emotional is not needed, and you
must love.

00:58:58.291 --> 00:59:04.339
And left one is the, is what you can call
another extreme.

00:59:04.539 --> 00:59:10.794
One side is - it is emotional, another
is rational.

00:59:10.995 --> 00:59:14.040
In rationality, you can start justifying
anything,

00:59:14.241 --> 00:59:18.406
like Hitler did. He said, “No, this was
right.

00:59:18.607 --> 00:59:21.535
I was doing was right!” He took something
into his head

00:59:21.736 --> 00:59:24.713
and ‘now, this was right’. This is
rationality.

00:59:24.914 --> 00:59:29.481
So both things are to be properly balanced
and you should see that

00:59:29.682 --> 00:59:36.150
whatever you are doing, are giving you
a proper result.

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.852
So thank you very much again and again.

00:59:41.053 --> 00:59:43.896
May God bless you.

00:59:57.511 --> 00:59:59.247
May God bless you all.
