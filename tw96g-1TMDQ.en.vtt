WEBVTT

08:00.284 --> 08:08.199
Since we have come to Cabella, it is
the ten years completed.

08:08.400 --> 08:14.076
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,

08:14.277 --> 08:20.563
we have been able to progress in Sahaja
Yoga.

08:22.463 --> 08:30.849
Now, today, we are going to have a Guru
puja.

08:31.971 --> 08:35.011
As I have said, you all are gurus

08:35.212 --> 08:42.086
and you want to worship Me as your Guru –
is alright –

08:42.287 --> 08:46.550
but the main thing one should understand

08:51.615 --> 09:02.234
that you have become guru, no doubt,
because you have the knowledge.

09:02.435 --> 09:05.138
You have the Absolute Knowledge,

09:05.339 --> 09:10.449
and so we can say you have become gurus,
no doubt.

09:10.649 --> 09:21.492
But one has to understand that you have
reached a state

09:21.693 --> 09:27.905
where you can raise the Kundalini, you can
give Realisation to others.

09:28.106 --> 09:33.135
Also you know what is the Absolute
Knowledge.

09:34.878 --> 09:42.134
To know the Absolute Knowledge is very
important

09:42.335 --> 09:49.319
and to assimilate is even much more
important.

09:50.234 --> 09:53.023
Though we know the Absolute Knowledge,

09:53.224 --> 09:56.143
we cannot assimilate it that well.

09:56.326 --> 10:04.382
That means we cannot go deep into it.
What is the reason for that?

10:04.652 --> 10:11.734
We have to realise that we have all come

10:11.935 --> 10:19.077
out of the heritage that was the animal
kingdom.

10:19.278 --> 10:23.495
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

10:23.696 --> 10:29.954
So, there are so many things of the animal
heritage

10:30.155 --> 10:39.318
linger in us: the aggressiveness,
the domination,

10:39.853 --> 10:52.209
peevishness, fear, grabbing.

10:52.941 --> 11:02.710
All these are our inheritance and they
are within us, lingering.

11:02.911 --> 11:06.943
We want to grab things of others;

11:07.144 --> 11:13.691
not you people, of course not, but people
who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

11:13.892 --> 11:17.668
They first used to grab lands,

11:17.869 --> 11:28.320
then they started grabbing people, making
them slaves.

11:29.444 --> 11:33.319
Then they were not satisfied with that,

11:33.520 --> 11:41.439
so they were grabbing kingdoms, jewellery
and all these things.

11:41.640 --> 11:47.734
So, just to grab. They have no legal right,

11:47.935 --> 11:50.779
still they would grab.

11:50.980 --> 11:58.358
It seems – it seems very funny, it seems
very inhuman,

11:58.559 --> 12:03.309
but it is there because of our inheritance.

12:03.936 --> 12:10.323
Now there are so many other things, like
jealousy.

12:10.524 --> 12:14.446
Among animals, there is very little
of that.

12:14.647 --> 12:20.167
They don’t have jealousies so much as we
have.

12:20.368 --> 12:28.597
While we have inherited this jealousy
by our own reactions and thinking.

12:30.777 --> 12:36.863
People get jealous and they want to put
down others.

12:37.064 --> 12:44.934
If they cannot achieve any height, they
want to bring down the heights of others.

12:45.135 --> 12:50.546
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings,

12:50.747 --> 12:55.210
they think whatever is done in the name
of jealousy is alright.

12:55.411 --> 13:02.479
They become very conscious that we are
lower than another person,

13:02.680 --> 13:06.650
we lack in some talents than another
person,

13:06.851 --> 13:11.758
and they try to overpower that person

13:11.959 --> 13:16.655
because of the force of jealousy behind it.

13:18.609 --> 13:24.169
Now the trouble is, though we are human
beings,

13:24.370 --> 13:32.040
we have inherited so many animal qualities:
like, we are ferocious,

13:32.240 --> 13:38.739
we are angry, and we get upset, as animals
do.

13:38.940 --> 13:46.316
But, additional to that, human beings can
react

13:46.517 --> 13:51.744
because of their thinking. They think,
they can think,

13:51.945 --> 14:01.365
and by thinking, all these inherited
properties become perverted.

14:01.566 --> 14:07.066
Like a person wants to put down another
person:

14:07.267 --> 14:12.157
then, he doesn’t behave like an animal,
in a straightforward way,

14:12.357 --> 14:20.033
but he will find out a device and method.
He’ll think it over, how to do it.

14:24.170 --> 14:31.643
The main problem with human beings is
that they still have inherited

14:31.852 --> 14:35.642
very violent temper.

14:35.843 --> 14:42.918
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

14:43.119 --> 14:46.960
When you see something which you don’t
like,

14:47.161 --> 14:50.706
which is against your will, maybe something
like that,

14:50.906 --> 14:54.358
immediately you flare up.

14:54.559 --> 15:02.596
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor,
they had put a sugar candy.

15:02.797 --> 15:08.158
To sugar candy, they were putting
the matchbox – you see,

15:08.359 --> 15:12.872
they were using match into it, matchstick.

15:13.073 --> 15:17.409
It would not take the fire. They tried
and tried, it would not.

15:17.610 --> 15:23.136
So I said, “Let Me see what is there.”
So that was a sugar candy!

15:23.337 --> 15:28.301
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

15:28.502 --> 15:32.369
So the quality of the person is known
in the same way.

15:32.570 --> 15:38.223
If with the slightest provocation, if he
gets into temper and gets annoyed,

15:38.424 --> 15:44.427
then his quality is not very good as
a guru.

15:44.628 --> 15:51.826
As a guru, we should not flare up, we
should not get angry,

15:52.027 --> 15:58.380
we should not try to oppress others.

15:58.588 --> 16:02.670
“But what can we do then?”, people will
ask.

16:02.871 --> 16:10.599
We have another method, what we call is
‘love’. Love.

16:10.800 --> 16:19.282
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person.

16:20.113 --> 16:28.897
So what happens that it doesn’t give you
any anger

16:29.098 --> 16:35.849
and the another person, you don’t make him
angry also. But anger begets anger.

16:36.050 --> 16:41.484
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort

16:41.685 --> 16:44.691
because he is afraid of you maybe there.

16:44.906 --> 16:48.925
But in his heart, he will keep a revenge
in his mind,

16:49.126 --> 16:53.946
that, “One day, I will show him. Why should
he get angry with me?”

16:54.146 --> 16:56.865
So, in Sahaja Yoga, please remember

16:57.066 --> 17:02.042
that love is the only way we can solve
the problem.

17:02.243 --> 17:06.766
Now, if something goes wrong, say,
in the ashram,

17:06.967 --> 17:10.893
if you get angry with that person, what
will happen?

17:11.094 --> 17:14.774
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

17:14.980 --> 17:17.519
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he will -
may realise

17:17.720 --> 17:22.420
that it was a wrong thing to do. But if he
is a bad Sahaja Yogi,

17:22.621 --> 17:26.845
not yet fully equipped to understand,

17:27.046 --> 17:37.800
then what he will do, he will just feel
that, “This man has insulted me,

17:38.001 --> 17:46.274
he has deliberately put me down and all
that, and I should try to take a revenge.”

17:47.871 --> 17:56.321
Among animals, this activity is very
limited.

17:56.570 --> 18:00.281
I don’t think they believe in revenge,
except for few animals

18:00.482 --> 18:09.718
they say that, if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite.

18:09.919 --> 18:14.221
It will come back on you. That’s what is
said.

18:14.422 --> 18:20.229
And this one is something, one quality
of the snake.

18:20.429 --> 18:26.846
But as we have passed through all these
different categories,

18:27.047 --> 18:32.653
we might be having some of the qualities
of some of these animals within us.

18:32.841 --> 18:35.792
We may be even snakes animals.

18:35.993 --> 18:41.675
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you,

18:41.876 --> 18:45.588
you’ll remember it all your life, “He has
hurt me,

18:45.789 --> 18:49.561
so I’ll put him right one day. I’ll take
a revenge!” –

18:49.762 --> 18:51.985
if there’s a snake within us.

18:52.186 --> 18:59.087
But now, if there’s a tiger within you: so
you’ll become very ferocious.

18:59.288 --> 19:03.773
At the smallest thing, you’ll get angry,
lose temper.

19:03.974 --> 19:12.832
Now, this is not a very good situation,

19:13.033 --> 19:17.391
that we are still at the level of animals

19:17.592 --> 19:21.175
and our inheritance is still working in us.

19:21.376 --> 19:25.177
So we have to keep a-watch, we have to be
good gurus.

19:25.378 --> 19:28.156
And for good guru, you have to have

19:28.357 --> 19:37.341
a very peaceful, compassionate, loving
temperament.

19:37.542 --> 19:40.206
After all,

19:50.882 --> 19:57.363
one has to understand that people have
this inheritance

19:57.564 --> 20:04.228
and some people have more, some people
have this, or some people have that.

20:04.442 --> 20:13.427
For that, if you get angry with that person
it’s not going to help him or help you,

20:13.628 --> 20:19.321
but if you are loving and compassionate,
and you explain that person

20:19.522 --> 20:23.135
what is the problem is and what you want
to do,

20:23.336 --> 20:25.252
I tell you, it will improve.

20:25.453 --> 20:29.213
He’ll definitely improve and he’ll feel
your love.

20:29.414 --> 20:37.897
Of course, sometimes, sometimes is
necessary to also forgive such a person.

20:38.098 --> 20:42.060
Such a person is to be forgiven,
absolutely.

20:42.261 --> 20:45.722
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs,

20:45.923 --> 20:48.322
all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

20:48.523 --> 20:52.316
and he goes on still with the same.
It doesn’t mean that.

20:52.517 --> 20:58.575
‘Forgiven’ means ‘forgotten’. Such and such
a person has been misbehaving,

20:58.776 --> 21:02.885
so just forget. Forget it. Completely
forget it!

21:03.086 --> 21:07.444
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja
Yogi guru.

21:07.645 --> 21:11.099
I must say other gurus were not like that.

21:11.300 --> 21:19.131
They were absolutely, I would say,
extremely hot-tempered

21:19.332 --> 21:23.556
and they used to lose temper on people.

21:23.757 --> 21:30.978
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them,

21:31.264 --> 21:35.075
and with this kindness You cannot create
good people.

21:35.276 --> 21:42.124
I have had enough of it!”, he said. “I had
made two people into gurus.

21:42.325 --> 21:47.279
And one of them got lost in the money.”

21:47.480 --> 21:49.516
“Alright, what happened to the second?”

21:49.716 --> 21:54.470
“And second one got lost in the women.”

21:54.671 --> 22:00.722
So, I said, “Now it’s alright, if they are
lost, they are lost.

22:00.923 --> 22:04.395
But if you can revive them with your love,
affection

22:04.595 --> 22:08.801
and kindness, better get around them.”

22:09.002 --> 22:15.073
So, the one who was lost…

22:17.472 --> 22:22.809
[I think if you open that door, people
sitting outside can also hear Me.

22:23.010 --> 22:26.983
So who are those sitting outside?

22:30.543 --> 22:36.947
Open it fully. Of course!

23:01.768 --> 23:04.165
Good.

23:22.840 --> 23:27.434
Let them move this side.

23:35.718 --> 23:38.861
Now is better.]

23:49.430 --> 23:52.668
So as a guru, you must conclude

23:52.869 --> 23:57.350
that they are still lingering with their
inheritance.

23:57.551 --> 24:05.476
But the second problem is much worse
because human beings can think.

24:06.095 --> 24:10.773
Of course, animals also think, but it is
always conditioning.

24:10.945 --> 24:14.681
Whatever conditioning they have,
accordingly they behave.

24:14.882 --> 24:21.908
But they don’t have ego, that kind,
as human beings have developed.

24:22.109 --> 24:28.730
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

24:28.984 --> 24:34.320
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that,

24:34.345 --> 24:38.546
“We have done so much! We have worked
so hard

24:38.931 --> 24:41.217
to achieve this state.

24:41.241 --> 24:44.116
And why should I give realization to others."

24:45.344 --> 24:52.336
Or, if they have got Realisation, then,

24:52.521 --> 24:56.559
“What have they done? Why should they
get Realisation?”

24:56.760 --> 25:03.989
It’s become a comparison between their
own state, and how they have achieved it,

25:04.189 --> 25:07.299
and how others have to achieve it.

25:07.500 --> 25:20.186
So they make all kinds of different
torturing, troubling maneuvers.

25:20.387 --> 25:30.878
For example, they may make the disciple
stand on his head,

25:31.079 --> 25:35.813
give his family up, do this, do that.

25:36.014 --> 25:39.241
They’ll beat the - they can beat also.

25:39.441 --> 25:45.048
They will make him stay in the water
for a long time.

25:45.249 --> 25:51.884
Make him stand on the one feet. Like this
they punish.

25:52.085 --> 25:59.123
And the worse comes to worse,

25:59.324 --> 26:06.035
they may beat with sticks or with stones.
They are like that.

26:06.236 --> 26:10.480
They don’t want to talk. They don’t want
to understand

26:10.656 --> 26:13.499
what the another person has to say,

26:13.700 --> 26:19.800
or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

26:21.603 --> 26:27.860
All this anger and all these things might
have been alright before,

26:28.061 --> 26:32.929
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you
must know it is not necessary.

26:33.130 --> 26:42.085
It is not at all necessary to give any
physical punishment to your disciples.

26:42.395 --> 26:48.342
Now, also the mental punishment to your
disciples should not be given.

26:48.551 --> 26:54.348
Like people start saying all kinds
of things to their disciples.

26:54.549 --> 26:58.463
Like, say - I’m saying, say there’s
a leader,

26:58.664 --> 27:03.390
and the leader finds something wrong
with the disciple,

27:03.591 --> 27:07.473
then he goes on saying, “Now, you are like
this, your father was like this,

27:07.674 --> 27:11.128
your grandfather was like this, your
great-grandfather was like this

27:11.329 --> 27:17.013
and you are also like this!” Or some sort
of thing that will hurt him.

27:17.214 --> 27:22.201
By hurting a person, you are not going
to help.

27:22.402 --> 27:26.860
Supposing, while walking you are hurt,
you can’t walk.

27:27.061 --> 27:34.843
In your spiritual ascent also, if you are
hurt, you cannot go ahead.

27:35.044 --> 27:39.236
So not to hurt people is very important.

27:39.437 --> 27:44.790
Once you go on hurting others, then you
are not a good guru.

27:44.991 --> 27:54.519
You are not a one who is really being kind
and understanding of the disciple.

27:54.881 --> 27:58.654
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a different thing
altogether.

27:58.855 --> 28:04.081
Because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga
without doing any kind of penance,

28:04.281 --> 28:12.576
any kind of guilty consciousness,
confessions, anything. Nothing!

28:12.866 --> 28:17.543
As you are, you got your Realisation.

28:18.481 --> 28:21.787
Nobody had to stand on their heads,
give up their husbands, wives,

28:21.988 --> 28:25.285
their families, this thing – nothing
of that kind.

28:25.486 --> 28:29.179
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

28:29.380 --> 28:36.854
whatever conditions you are, you are given
Realisation – is a fact.

28:37.050 --> 28:39.248
You don’t have to pay for it.

28:39.449 --> 28:43.194
You don’t have to exert yourself. Don’t
have to do anything.

28:43.394 --> 28:48.741
Just you get it, sitting down, wherever
you are.

28:49.185 --> 28:54.319
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

28:54.519 --> 28:59.611
that you have a power of love,
of compassion.

28:59.812 --> 29:04.971
Out of your love you have given Realisation
to people. We never realise that.

29:05.172 --> 29:08.648
Supposing we are anxious to give
Realisation to people,

29:08.821 --> 29:13.273
we want to go to the villages and work
there, and give them Realisation.

29:13.474 --> 29:16.037
Why? Why do we do it?

29:16.253 --> 29:21.273
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

29:21.473 --> 29:26.572
but just out of the love that is within
your heart, that you feel,

29:26.773 --> 29:31.412
“Why am I enjoying everything? Why others
are not enjoying?”

29:31.613 --> 29:39.982
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realisation.

29:40.183 --> 29:43.318
Now you have become a greater human being

29:43.480 --> 29:47.174
and you feel concerned - others are getting
ruined,

29:47.375 --> 29:51.053
they are going on a wrong path, they are
doing wrong things,

29:51.254 --> 29:59.412
and that makes you feel very, very upset
and you want to help them.

30:00.804 --> 30:05.959
And this understanding, once you have, then
you will know how to deal

30:06.128 --> 30:13.658
with the person with whom you have
to behave like a guru.

30:14.532 --> 30:21.790
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

30:22.155 --> 30:27.279
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they are committing.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.764
But that too in a such a soft manner

30:31.965 --> 30:39.304
that a person doesn’t get any shock out
of that.

30:40.399 --> 30:50.622
All this thing of attachments also: now,
somebody has too much attachment,

30:50.823 --> 30:56.932
say, for the family, for the wife, for
the husband, children or something.

30:57.133 --> 31:04.386
And once they come to Sahaj Yog, still they
have the same amount of attachment –

31:04.587 --> 31:07.609
alright, doesn’t matter.

31:07.810 --> 31:11.513
But how far they will go with that
attachment,

31:11.714 --> 31:18.942
how long it will continue, is the point.
You should be detached.

31:19.143 --> 31:25.963
If I say, you cannot be. It’s a state. It’s
a state of mind when you are detached.

31:26.164 --> 31:30.416
But when it comes to doing something
for them,

31:30.617 --> 31:36.880
you will go all out to help them. But you
are not an attached person.

31:37.080 --> 31:41.899
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

31:42.100 --> 31:46.892
Attached person is always worried about
the other person,

31:47.093 --> 31:53.378
goes on thinking about the other person,
cannot think of Sahaja Yoga,

31:53.579 --> 31:57.136
only think of the people with whom he is
attached.

31:57.337 --> 32:00.280
Then he is very sensitive. You can’t say
anything

32:00.480 --> 32:05.023
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise
he jumps.

32:05.224 --> 32:11.554
Attachment is also with the name that
he has.

32:11.755 --> 32:16.204
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing,

32:16.405 --> 32:21.631
or some big position, then what does he do?

32:21.832 --> 32:26.561
You can’t challenge him any way.

32:26.762 --> 32:30.810
You cannot, by any words you can challenge
him,

32:31.011 --> 32:33.801
because he is so identified with that.

32:34.001 --> 32:40.909
He thinks he is a big person who has
achieved such a lot of positions in life.

32:41.110 --> 32:53.545
He’s so much attached that he wants
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

32:53.746 --> 33:04.774
Now, which is the way you can solve that
problem?

33:06.633 --> 33:14.941
Supposing somebody is very much attached
to his wife, say, for example:

33:15.142 --> 33:20.630
then you should not discuss and argue with
that person, not at all,

33:20.831 --> 33:27.076
because he is still coming up slowly,
slowly, up to this stage.

33:27.277 --> 33:33.722
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

33:33.923 --> 33:40.500
So what do you have to do? If he is
attached to his wife, let it be.

33:41.934 --> 33:47.535
But the Divine will work it out, and he
will realise

33:47.736 --> 33:56.248
that what he has been thinking, doing and
taking decisions is all wrong.

33:56.601 --> 34:01.872
And once he discovered it himself, then
he will get detached.

34:02.072 --> 34:06.340
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out,

34:06.541 --> 34:11.565
it will never work out. So you must
understand

34:11.766 --> 34:19.494
that, as human beings, whatever we were,
also as Sahaja Yogis we have problems,

34:19.695 --> 34:25.214
and these should be slowly, slowly, should
be dissolved.

34:25.415 --> 34:28.976
Not by argument, not by saying things,

34:29.177 --> 34:38.206
but by love and compassion. If you have
love for a person -

34:38.817 --> 34:44.522
you’ll be amazed, ninety-nine percent
people value love.

34:45.562 --> 34:49.578
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

34:49.779 --> 34:53.758
First is his inheritance, second is he
thinks

34:53.959 --> 34:57.533
and thirdly that he values love.

34:57.734 --> 35:03.855
Anybody who loves, the another person
values that love,

35:04.056 --> 35:13.253
because he thinks that, “This particular
person is loving me, not my wealth,

35:13.454 --> 35:18.483
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he
is loving me!”

35:18.684 --> 35:26.056
And this idea of love, this is something
that will get him

35:26.257 --> 35:31.565
completely detached from that person,
easily. How?

35:31.765 --> 35:36.266
Now, it looks very funny that, if you like
somebody,

35:36.467 --> 35:43.228
if you love somebody, and then you should
get detached.

35:43.429 --> 35:47.087
Is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

35:47.288 --> 35:53.138
In Sahaja Yoga, your state of mind is such

35:53.338 --> 36:03.778
that you are absolutely detached and
absolutely attached. How?

36:03.979 --> 36:17.325
For example, now, say, I have My daughter.
So I’m detached.

36:17.526 --> 36:21.853
I never telephone to her, I’m never
bothered about her.

36:22.054 --> 36:26.488
Because in Sahaja Yoga you know how is
that person.

36:26.688 --> 36:29.727
If the vibrations are alright, why should
you telephone?

36:29.928 --> 36:33.084
Why should you talk to her? Why should you
ask for anything?

36:33.285 --> 36:38.611
No need. Only on vibrations you’ll know
how the person is.

36:38.812 --> 36:42.719
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

36:42.888 --> 36:47.941
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

36:48.142 --> 36:52.235
or are indicating something serious about
that person,

36:52.436 --> 37:01.095
what you will do you’ll put full attention
to that. Full attention.

37:01.296 --> 37:06.010
You put attention, but not attachment.

37:06.653 --> 37:09.940
So the attachment doesn’t solve
the problem.

37:10.141 --> 37:13.642
What solves the problem is attention.

37:13.843 --> 37:21.472
But when you are not detached, then your
attention is attached attention.

37:21.673 --> 37:27.848
It’s an attention that is not available
to everyone,

37:28.049 --> 37:31.746
an attention that gets stuck, absolutely
stuck

37:31.947 --> 37:38.224
into that person with whom you are
identified. You try to understand.

37:38.424 --> 37:45.954
So to be identified with someone is not
actually, what we can say,

37:46.155 --> 37:50.040
paying attention to that person.

37:50.579 --> 37:53.649
And then your attention will work.

37:53.850 --> 37:57.284
If you are of that level, whenever you
put attention

37:57.485 --> 38:02.929
to that particular person who needs your
attention, it will work out.

38:03.130 --> 38:07.039
But if you are all the time wasting your
attention on a person

38:07.240 --> 38:10.052
because you are attached to that person,

38:10.253 --> 38:15.534
your attention will be tired, it won’t work
out.

38:15.735 --> 38:23.990
It’s a big – I should say – paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

38:24.191 --> 38:27.827
then your attention doesn’t work out.

38:28.028 --> 38:32.419
And if you are not attached to that person,
you do everything else.

38:32.619 --> 38:34.785
Now, You - I have to give lecture, alright,
I’m giving lecture,

38:34.985 --> 38:38.745
then I have to do some cooking, I’ll do
cooking; this, that, that and that.

38:38.946 --> 38:42.786
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person,

38:42.986 --> 38:49.754
all the time you want to have connection
with that person, it’s not necessary.

38:49.955 --> 38:55.195
That person is alright. What is there to be
so much worried about that person?

38:55.395 --> 38:58.375
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

38:58.575 --> 39:00.652
you have to raise Kundalini of so many -

39:00.852 --> 39:07.051
now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, is not a very good thing.

39:07.252 --> 39:12.710
By that kind of attachment, your attention
also becomes

39:12.911 --> 39:19.140
useless, absolutely useless. So let
the attention be free.

39:19.341 --> 39:26.677
Attention should not be bound by your
attachments.

39:26.878 --> 39:30.686
Attention should be absolutely free,

39:30.887 --> 39:37.577
so it works automatically, automatically.

39:37.778 --> 39:42.430
And you will be amazed, even if you do not
pay attention,

39:42.631 --> 39:45.538
the attention will work it (out).

39:45.739 --> 39:51.183
It is such a great thing to have this
spiritual attention,

39:51.384 --> 39:55.725
which is nothing but love. It will just
act.

39:55.925 --> 40:00.353
You’ll be amazed how it acts.

40:00.645 --> 40:05.094
It’s another world I’m talking about, not
this mundane world,

40:05.302 --> 40:10.500
but something higher, where your attention
works,

40:10.701 --> 40:14.973
and works so beautifully that you are
amazed how it has worked.

40:15.174 --> 40:19.455
But you should not bound it by your
attachments.

40:19.656 --> 40:23.289
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere -

40:23.490 --> 40:29.308
only the people who are attached to you,
or you are attached to those persons.

40:29.728 --> 40:37.073
That’s why identification is not the way
a guru should work it out.

40:43.598 --> 40:53.356
Now, there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

40:53.557 --> 40:56.904
He thinks, “You see, he is the best and he
should be encouraged

40:57.120 --> 41:05.735
and should be given all the possible help.”
But that’s not going to help.

41:05.936 --> 41:09.501
What, on the contrary, he should say is,
“This is already a good fellow.

41:09.702 --> 41:13.255
He has risen very high. He’s gone very
deep.

41:13.455 --> 41:17.488
So pay attention to those who are not
so good

41:17.689 --> 41:23.967
and talk to them about it, that: “You have
to come up.” In a very sweet manner.

41:24.168 --> 41:29.740
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there,

41:29.941 --> 41:36.012
or who are still struggling. You have
to understand them.

41:36.213 --> 41:41.393
You have to notice: What are they doing?

41:41.593 --> 41:49.102
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

41:49.303 --> 41:54.816
What is the problem? Why the Divine is
not flowing through them?

41:55.017 --> 42:01.430
And you’ll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention –

42:01.607 --> 42:06.596
is because it is focused on someone
all the time,

42:07.251 --> 42:12.121
and they feel it is their responsibility
that it should be focused.

42:12.322 --> 42:19.624
It’s just to give, you see, an explanation.
It’s just an explanation to say that

42:19.825 --> 42:24.873
“You see, naturally, I have to be worried
about this and worried about that!”

42:25.074 --> 42:28.092
It’s just an explanation.

42:28.293 --> 42:33.120
But if you really don’t fix your attention

42:33.321 --> 42:36.595
to one person or ten persons only,

42:36.796 --> 42:42.749
then your attention looks after the whole
world.

42:46.934 --> 42:53.360
It receives all the information and also
it gives

42:53.560 --> 43:00.763
all the information what is to be done
to correct that situation.

43:00.964 --> 43:05.818
So one has to rise into that state where
you do not get angry,

43:06.019 --> 43:10.827
annoyed, upset. No, not at all.

43:11.028 --> 43:18.302
What happens to you, that you see
a situation

43:18.503 --> 43:23.624
and in that you are not involved.

43:23.825 --> 43:28.063
You see the situation and you are away
from it.

43:28.264 --> 43:32.493
Then you can solve that problem better.

43:32.694 --> 43:40.190
But if you are part and parcel of that
problem, then you cannot solve.

43:40.617 --> 43:47.186
It’s like this, I was telling, that those
who are fighting, say,

43:49.265 --> 43:52.241
cannot solve the problem.

43:52.442 --> 44:00.032
But a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

44:00.233 --> 44:10.310
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that, if you are identified,

44:10.511 --> 44:21.725
if you are involved with one person or with
one kind of a thing, then you are lost.

44:23.458 --> 44:27.144
So our attention has to be always free

44:27.345 --> 44:32.792
and can be applied widely, wherever needed.

44:32.993 --> 44:38.693
That is the state one has to reach. If you
reach that state of mind, is -

44:38.894 --> 44:44.429
not I’m saying you can do anything about
it, it’s just a state of mind.

44:44.630 --> 44:51.947
Now, how do we do that? Only through
introspection.

44:53.668 --> 44:57.407
Through introspection you will understand

44:57.608 --> 45:04.195
that you need help to solve your problems.

45:04.396 --> 45:10.298
Firstly, the problem is how to face
yourself,

45:10.499 --> 45:17.905
because you are little bit shy or maybe
nervous about it.

45:18.189 --> 45:29.218
As the time comes, you’ll be amazed that
this nervousness has no meaning at all.

45:29.549 --> 45:41.566
When you try to be deliberate about it,
then it won’t work out,

45:41.767 --> 45:45.668
but if you are sahaj it will work out.

45:45.869 --> 45:51.056
So we come to the second point, apart
from the attention,

45:51.257 --> 45:57.023
that we should leave everything into
the hands of Paramchaitanya.

45:57.224 --> 46:00.748
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

46:00.949 --> 46:05.246
“This is the problem. Let Paramchaitanya
solve the problem.

46:05.447 --> 46:09.822
We are not bothered!” So a detachment
comes in.

46:10.023 --> 46:14.630
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve.

46:14.831 --> 46:19.141
So you are not in it, you are away from it.

46:19.342 --> 46:24.629
Very, very simple things are there, that
if you understand

46:24.830 --> 46:31.933
that we suffer because everybody feels
responsible for us.

46:32.134 --> 46:39.688
Everybody thinks they are responsible,
they have to do this responsibility for us.

46:39.889 --> 46:42.488
Somebody says, this responsibility he has
to do.

46:42.689 --> 46:46.646
All these things are worrying them and that
is the reason

46:46.847 --> 46:51.332
today we have a very complex society.

46:51.533 --> 46:55.309
They are suffering from all kinds
of diseases,

46:55.510 --> 47:00.669
in which only thinking is responsible.

47:00.870 --> 47:03.794
By this thinking all the time – thinking
about one person,

47:03.995 --> 47:08.562
thinking about one problem – you reach
nowhere.

47:08.763 --> 47:14.071
At that moment, what you have to do is
to leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

47:14.272 --> 47:21.249
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage,

47:27.232 --> 47:33.808
It will solve the problem. Now I will tell
you one thing, an experience:

47:34.009 --> 47:38.248
this time I was in America and we wanted
to have a puja there.

47:38.449 --> 47:45.149
So I said, “Alright, let them come for
the puja. It’s nice if they want to come.”

47:45.349 --> 47:50.252
Then they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to bring presents for you, for the puja,

47:50.453 --> 47:57.064
so how can we bring the presents?” I said,
“It’s very simple: don’t bring!”.

47:57.265 --> 48:01.424
But they wouldn’t listen to that. They
said, “We’ll have to bring,

48:01.625 --> 48:06.022
and the customs will trouble us and do
this and do that.”

48:06.230 --> 48:10.874
So there was only one building ahead,

48:11.075 --> 48:18.672
there was another building, where they were
having a liquidation sale.

48:18.873 --> 48:22.446
I said, “This is something nice! One can
have a look at it.”

48:22.647 --> 48:28.603
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable!

48:28.804 --> 48:33.613
Very, very expensive things for throw-away
prices.

48:33.814 --> 48:36.330
I was amazed how it is there.

48:36.530 --> 48:39.999
So I told them, “I can purchase all these
things. I’ll pay you.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.039
But you bring all these things
to Canajoharie.”

48:43.240 --> 48:47.352
They agreed, “Alright, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

48:47.553 --> 48:52.628
And they brought all the things, all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

48:52.829 --> 48:59.758
We had no problem of customs or anything.
I paid them there.

49:01.951 --> 49:06.504
How, you see, things can be improved,

49:06.705 --> 49:19.373
by understanding what is the most important
thing is to love.

49:19.574 --> 49:25.392
But love is truth and truth is love.

49:25.593 --> 49:31.577
If you have love for somebody, genuine
love,

49:31.778 --> 49:39.245
then anything you want to do with that
person will be absolutely obvious

49:39.445 --> 49:43.335
because it will be truthful.

49:43.908 --> 49:48.902
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

49:49.103 --> 49:53.262
because it is absolutely truthful.

49:53.463 --> 49:56.623
So when you are dealing with somebody,
also,

49:56.824 --> 50:00.120
you should be extremely truthful.

50:00.321 --> 50:04.947
Of course, you need not say things that
will hurt him,

50:05.124 --> 50:10.007
but you must use such ways and methods

50:10.208 --> 50:15.125
that will not, in any way, hurt the other
person -

50:15.326 --> 50:19.405
which will have an effect on that person.

50:20.183 --> 50:24.980
So this kind of a gurus we need now,
very much, in Sahaja Yoga,

50:25.180 --> 50:28.382
because Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

50:28.583 --> 50:35.729
So first of all, our temper has to be
brought into proper shape.

50:35.938 --> 50:40.436
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru, has no business

50:40.637 --> 50:48.103
to lose temper, at all, on any point
whatsoever.

50:48.521 --> 50:54.806
If they can really do that much, it will
save our,

50:55.007 --> 51:02.769
I mean, so much of worry, so much
of problems, so much of mess we create.

51:02.970 --> 51:11.620
All this can be solved very easily, but
first we must have pure love in our heart,

51:11.821 --> 51:16.367
not love out of some gain or out of some
sort of a reward,

51:16.567 --> 51:20.896
but pure love if we have, then we can work
it out,

51:21.097 --> 51:26.240
very easily, anything that you want to do.

51:26.441 --> 51:33.256
This is a very lengthy thing which can
go on forever

51:33.457 --> 51:39.563
because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

51:39.764 --> 51:44.189
and why they are gurus. It’s very
important,

51:44.390 --> 51:47.937
very important position that they are
gurus.

51:48.145 --> 51:53.962
And they should use that position for
exhibiting

51:54.163 --> 51:57.855
tremendous understanding of their
disciples,

51:58.056 --> 52:05.955
and also their purpose, it should be
clear-cut.

52:06.156 --> 52:08.334
People should not doubt him,

52:08.535 --> 52:12.868
should not think, “Why he is doing such
and such things?”

52:13.069 --> 52:20.199
It should not be a mystery, but it should
be absolutely clear-cut.

52:21.293 --> 52:26.282
All these things I’m telling you today,
because today

52:26.483 --> 52:33.278
we have completed ten - our ten years
of stay in Cabella.

52:33.479 --> 52:36.743
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me,

52:36.944 --> 52:41.462
it has brought forth lots of people
to Sahaja Yoga,

52:41.663 --> 52:44.306
I tell you – very lots of people.

52:44.507 --> 52:47.868
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it

52:48.069 --> 52:51.263
and said, “Where are You going to live?”
and all that.

52:51.463 --> 52:57.359
But here only it has worked, and that
should be accepted

52:57.560 --> 53:10.422
as a very good indication that Sahaja Yoga
does miraculous things – miraculous.

53:10.585 --> 53:17.502
But the foremost thing is you must know
vibrations.

53:17.764 --> 53:21.061
If you don’t know about vibrations then you
can’t do it.

53:21.262 --> 53:24.082
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me,

53:24.283 --> 53:27.657
“Mother, very lonely place, there are
mafias around,

53:27.858 --> 53:33.782
they have only six, seven houses there.
Where are You going? What is this?”.

53:33.983 --> 53:38.553
They all warned Me. So I came here

53:38.754 --> 53:41.214
and immediately I told the mayor,
“I’m going to buy it

53:41.415 --> 53:44.511
and tomorrow I’ll pay you the money.”

53:44.712 --> 53:50.283
He was surprised, how can I do that.

53:50.484 --> 53:56.859
I said, “Don’t worry! Perfectly alright”.
On vibrations it worked.

53:57.060 --> 54:03.023
On vibrations I decided that this is
a wonderful place

54:03.224 --> 54:09.594
and vibrations helped Me so much that time;
though everybody discouraged Me

54:09.795 --> 54:14.191
and everybody gave Me a very big picture,
horrible one.

54:14.392 --> 54:20.272
But still, where is the mafia now?
It’s gone, finished.

54:23.072 --> 54:28.450
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

54:28.651 --> 54:36.640
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

54:36.828 --> 54:42.658
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

54:42.859 --> 54:47.793
your particular ideas about particular
things,

54:47.994 --> 54:54.014
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

54:54.996 --> 54:59.444
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

54:59.645 --> 55:03.040
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

55:03.241 --> 55:09.849
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

55:10.050 --> 55:15.949
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

55:17.510 --> 55:22.381
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

55:22.582 --> 55:27.024
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

55:27.225 --> 55:34.740
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

55:34.941 --> 55:41.138
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

55:41.339 --> 55:45.311
It emits and creates a path for you,

55:45.512 --> 55:50.073
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

55:50.274 --> 55:54.581
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

55:54.782 --> 55:59.560
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

55:59.761 --> 56:04.189
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

56:04.389 --> 56:11.786
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

56:11.987 --> 56:15.202
May God bless you all.

56:29.437 --> 56:34.312
There’s one thing is important
to understand,

56:34.513 --> 56:38.386
that you should not go to extremes
of everything –

56:38.587 --> 56:40.976
which is also a human quality.

56:41.176 --> 56:46.180
For example, if they are rational, they
go on rationalising everything,

56:46.381 --> 56:51.593
“I can’t do this, I can’t do that,”
something like that, goes on.

56:51.794 --> 56:56.302
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

56:56.503 --> 56:59.854
and they become so emotional that they
start doing wrong things

57:00.055 --> 57:06.869
in the name of emotionality. You have
to overcome these two things.

57:07.070 --> 57:10.799
If you have not overcome that, what’s
the use?

57:11.000 --> 57:13.357
What’s the use of calling yourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

57:13.558 --> 57:17.316
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

57:17.517 --> 57:22.147
Going to the extremes must be avoided.
Keep a-watch upon yourself.

57:22.348 --> 57:26.400
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out.

57:26.601 --> 57:31.221
You might develop cancer, develop very
horrible diseases on one side,

57:31.422 --> 57:35.245
and on the other side you might become
a very rational person

57:35.446 --> 57:39.386
and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

57:39.587 --> 57:45.899
So you have to keep the balance
all the time.

57:46.099 --> 57:51.018
And with that balance - like, somebody
is a Sahaja Yogini

57:51.219 --> 57:53.481
and she has done something very wrong,

57:53.682 --> 57:56.661
then you should not become emotionally
attached,

57:56.862 --> 57:59.382
“Oh, Mother, what is it? We should forgive
her.”

57:59.583 --> 58:10.586
No. You tell her that, “You must improve
your vibrations and must come to balance.

58:10.786 --> 58:18.450
And once you are in balance, then I will –
I will consider your case.

58:18.651 --> 58:23.546
Then I will say it is so or not.” But if he
has no balance,

58:23.747 --> 58:27.955
he goes into rationality, he goes into
emotional things -

58:28.156 --> 58:32.369
and this emotional business can take you
to any, any nonsensical thing,

58:32.570 --> 58:38.129
as it is a psychological case. And one
can go into very, very wrong things

58:38.330 --> 58:42.220
that they are doing out of this emotional
thing;

58:42.421 --> 58:49.748
you see, like even singing songs that are
neurotic, or anything, you see.

58:49.958 --> 58:53.323
All this emotional thing can take you
anywhere.

58:53.503 --> 58:58.090
So to be emotional is not needed, and you
must love.

58:58.291 --> 59:04.339
And left one is the, is what you can call
another extreme.

59:04.539 --> 59:10.794
One side is - it is emotional, another
is rational.

59:10.995 --> 59:14.040
In rationality, you can start justifying
anything,

59:14.241 --> 59:18.406
like Hitler did. He said, “No, this was
right.

59:18.607 --> 59:21.535
I was doing was right!” He took something
into his head

59:21.736 --> 59:24.713
and ‘now, this was right’. This is
rationality.

59:24.914 --> 59:29.481
So both things are to be properly balanced
and you should see that

59:29.682 --> 59:36.150
whatever you are doing, are giving you
a proper result.

59:38.430 --> 59:40.852
So thank you very much again and again.

59:41.053 --> 59:43.896
May God bless you.

59:57.511 --> 59:59.247
May God bless you all.
