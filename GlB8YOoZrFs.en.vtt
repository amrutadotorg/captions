00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.010
Shri Mataji, what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.220
Sahaja.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.040
Sa means ‘with’

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.846
Ja means ‘born’.

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:15.386
So it is born with you.’ The right’

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:20.802
to become ‘united,’ which is the yoga with the Divine.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:25.302
And this Sahaja Yoga is something that everybody can have, is it?

00:00:25.382 --> 00:00:27.752
Is it something, everybody can practice?

00:00:27.832 --> 00:00:29.472
Of course.

00:00:29.552 --> 00:00:36.430
And how does this connection with the Divine take place?

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.588
We have within ourselves this power in the triangular bone

00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:44.068
which is called a ‘Sacrum’ meaning sacred,

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:48.658
which when awakened sprouts like a plumule in a seed

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:52.743
and rises through six subtle centres,

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:56.933
opens out in the last centre

00:00:57.013 --> 00:01:01.093
and gets connected with the Divine,

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:04.870
which is subtle energy, all around us,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.300
which organises us,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.440
which nourishes us, does all the living work.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.729
Above all it loves us.

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:19.209
Does this mean Shri Mataji, that people who have not

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.833
had the ability to practice Sahaja Yoga are not connected with the Divine?

00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:25.903
Most of them are not.

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:29.773
And if some of them are, they don’t know all about it.

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:31.781
So this is what,

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:37.011
an extra force that is available to human beings to develop themselves in this world?

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:41.296
Of course.
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution,

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:44.196
where you have to get connected with the Divine.

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:47.206
You have to feel it on your central nervous system

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:50.359
and that’s how you get Self-realization.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.688
Do I perceive here that this is a way of balancing oneself?

00:01:57.768 --> 00:02:03.464
Of keeping in such a way of living one’s life,

00:02:03.554 --> 00:02:08.074
that one is not unbalanced in one’s view of what is going on around us?

00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:12.702
Yes. We have two sides in our system of the autonomous nervous system,

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:13.952
left and right,

00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:17.402
which we call as left and right sympathetic nervous system.

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:23.931
Left side caters for our emotions,

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:26.961
for our past, our desires.

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:31.434
The right side caters for our action,

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:33.664
physical and mental.

00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:37.584
If you indulge in one too much and go too far with it,

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:41.522
you develop an imbalance within yourself.

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:46.906
In the centre lies the third power which we call as parasympathetic nervous system.

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:50.656
This is the channel which is the central path of ascent.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:52.896
When the kundalini rises through it,

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:55.568
it brings you in the balance

00:02:55.648 --> 00:03:00.308
because it rises in the centre of the system.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:04.897
So this is the minimum that happens, that you develop your balance.

00:03:04.977 --> 00:03:09.906
So how does one actually achieve this balance?

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:13.756
It just happens spontaneously.

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:17.745
In other words, there is no physical requirement on an individual?

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:20.495
Not at all. Not at all.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.345
It’s an evolutionary step. As I told you

00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:28.235
in our evolution, we have developed a balance, we can stand on our two legs.

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:29.881
Animals cannot.

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:37.981
In the same way, you develop this special balance between your emotions and your actions

00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:41.121
in a very proper way.

00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:45.411
You speak as though this is some sort of evolutionary step.

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:46.501
Yes it is.

00:03:46.581 --> 00:03:48.631
It is the last breakthrough,

00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:50.971
that you have to become the Spirit now

00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:53.841
and this has to be achieved,

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.792
which can be achieved only through a living process

00:03:56.872 --> 00:04:00.571
because we have become human beings through a living process

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.417
and that living process has to act within us.

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:09.757
This sounds as though it is rather a significant time than in the history of humanity?

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:10.897
Very much.

00:04:10.977 --> 00:04:14.437
In the history of humanity, in the history of evolution,

00:04:14.517 --> 00:04:18.660
in the history of spirituality, it is the most important time

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.790
because here, where you will get whatever has been promised to you so far.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.791
So it is no accident then that Sahaja Yoga has appeared in the world at this time?

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.991
No, not at all, not at all.

00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.771
It is all predicted thousands of years back in India

00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.681
and later on by many Saints.

00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:41.041
Even William Blake has predicted it.

00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:48.467
Shri Mataji you went to Russia last year and I believe the reception you got was most surprising?

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.207
Yes.

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:53.920
I was myself surprised

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.233
because thousands of people came

00:04:56.313 --> 00:05:00.918
and very sensible well-educated people came

00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:03.518
and they all settled down. Thousands.

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:08.528
I did not know how to cope with that number because there were so many,

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:15.197
and even the members of the supreme council, the government, they came.

00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:23.497
but I could only say that in the so-called free societies

00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:27.455
we waste too much time experimenting with our freedom

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:32.529
and indulge too much into politics which is a waste thing, I think,

00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:35.359
then the economics, all these things.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.699
While the people there did not have any such chances.

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:43.691
So they put their energies to something that was higher than that.

00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.281
They diverted and they were very knowledgeable,

00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:48.791
they knew a lot about seeking.

00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:54.039
They knew a lot about Kundalini and as if they were just waiting for me.

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.759
It was very remarkable.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.940
Mr Gorbachev has said the Russians require a mental revolution.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.139
Do you see the acceptance of Sahaja yoga as part of this revolution?

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.969
Of course. He himself is a saint

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:11.885
and what he is meaning by ‘mental’, that

00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:17.096
they should now understand that they have to develop that balance

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:20.621
between communism and democracy.

00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:22.931
Our democracies are imbalanced.

00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:24.301
They are one-sided.

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:27.401
They have no.. not the other side of collectivity

00:06:27.481 --> 00:06:29.798
but communism has collectivity.

00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:31.828
It is power-oriented.

00:06:31.908 --> 00:06:37.806
Our democracies are money-oriented.

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:43.006
What he is meaning is the maturity of our wisdom

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:47.091
So referring back to what we were talking about earlier,

00:06:47.302 --> 00:06:49.115
is it...?

00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:58.523
As we were talking about earlier, about bringing the human body into balance?

00:06:58.603 --> 00:07:04.467
Could we say then that Mr Gorbachev is bringing the whole eastern Bloc into balance?

00:07:04.547 --> 00:07:06.247
Yes.

00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:15.317
Yes, they had gone too much on one side and he is trying to bring them in the centre.

00:07:17.993 --> 00:07:23.713
You mentioned that you went to an eastern bloc conference last year

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:29.630
and I believe you gave many influential people, Realisation?

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.240
Is it true that you believe that this was instrumental in helping the overthrow of oppressive communism?

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.350
It was a yoga, yoga seminar

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.650
and I expected all of them to be there

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.072
and surprisingly I talked to them hardly for 30 to 35 minutes

00:07:46.152 --> 00:07:49.522
and then I gave them realisation and all of them got it.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:54.092
They were representatives from all these Eastern Bloc Countries.

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:57.366
When they got it they were so surprised at it,

00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:00.586
then they walked out with me out of the hall

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:03.936
and nobody was left in the hall to listen to other people.

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:08.405
They gave me their addresses and they said we want ‘this only’, in our country

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:13.155
and they wanted to start centres and I am told they have already started centres.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:21.197
The all-pervading power requires a medium, to trigger something

00:08:21.277 --> 00:08:24.840
and when these people were created as Realised souls,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.566
as they got connected with this ‘ all-pervading power’,

00:08:28.647 --> 00:08:30.162
I think they had triggered it.

00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:33.002
They had that confidence within them,

00:08:33.082 --> 00:08:35.352
that courage in them

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.484
because once we are realised, you become very courageous

00:08:38.564 --> 00:08:42.334
and you want to establish truth at any cost.

00:08:43.364 --> 00:08:46.944
Shri Mataji the West, shall we call it the Western Nations

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:52.441
have had Sahaja Yoga available to them to investigate

00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:57.761
to see for themselves how it worked for 20 years

00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.891
and yet it has been very slow to grow.

00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:02.784
Why has it happened this way, do you think?

00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:09.912
Here people have so many diverse ideas about things.

00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:15.390
They're very self-opinionated also about things

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.340
and the so called man made religions all over

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.980
have also conditioned them too much.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.650
They've other conditioning of different norms that they have

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.125
as far as the social life is concerned

00:09:30.205 --> 00:09:37.235
and the physical appearances rather on a very superficial level.

00:09:37.315 --> 00:09:40.429
So the people have not grown, I think so, much deeper.

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:44.039
Of course, I must say there are so many seekers in the west,

00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:46.119
So many seekers

00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:55.688
and they were lost because as soon as people knew that there’s a market for them,

00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:57.914
the false gurus jumped out

00:09:57.994 --> 00:10:01.094
and they started preaching about false things

00:10:01.174 --> 00:10:03.017
just to earn money.

00:10:03.097 --> 00:10:05.214
They were all money-oriented people,

00:10:05.294 --> 00:10:08.518
Now there’s another psychology with the western mind

00:10:08.598 --> 00:10:11.158
that you must buy everything.

00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:14.708
If something is not for sale, then it is useless

00:10:14.788 --> 00:10:20.287
and this psychology has really deterred them to come to Sahaja Yoga very much

00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:23.458
because this is a living process and you cannot pay for it

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:24.917
and they could not bear it.

00:10:24.997 --> 00:10:26.467
I mean, actually, I must say,

00:10:26.547 --> 00:10:31.871
one of the very important television gentlemen told me off

00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:37.591
that Anglo Saxon brain cannot accept anything which cannot be sold.

00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.271
I did not know what to tell him.

00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:43.900
I just said,’ Who has made this brain?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.290
This God has made. Then why is it so?’

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:53.470
So You have an expectation really that this thing called Sahaja Yoga will change the world?

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.830
Of course.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.580
It changes human beings and they manifest a change outside.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.210
And we create a new race.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.190
That is what they are talking about.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.329
If you want they talk of a new age, of a new race

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.095
but I don’t know what is their imagination about it.

00:11:08.176 --> 00:11:10.377
They talk about all this thing, ‘Aquarius.’

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:12.834
And Aquarius is the kundalini.

00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:17.085
She is placed in the Aquarius, and they talk about the Aquarius age.

00:11:17.165 --> 00:11:20.894
All kinds of things they are talking, writing, thinking about it,

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:24.364
but when it comes to actualisation.

00:11:24.444 --> 00:11:27.374
I think they think I am very too simple for them.

00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:29.274
Not complicated.

00:11:29.354 --> 00:11:31.921
And Sahaja yoga is too simple.

00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:34.311
It should be very complicated.

00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:38.661
And all their own ideas about seeking, that they must suffer,

00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:40.321
they must go to the Himalayas,

00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:42.531
they must starve themselves

00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:45.003
and then only they can get realisation

00:11:47.483 --> 00:11:53.693
Shri Mataji, is the evolution of the planet closely related to the evolution of humanity?

00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:57.331
Of course. It is very much related,

00:11:57.411 --> 00:12:01.831
and the planet, our planet is moving in a spiral way.

00:12:01.911 --> 00:12:05.051
All the planets are moving in a spiral way

00:12:05.131 --> 00:12:10.740
and they are creating all possible things for the use of human beings

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.938
so that they can save time.

00:12:14.018 --> 00:12:19.478
Save time for getting their ascent and for meditative growth,

00:12:19.558 --> 00:12:23.378
but people don’t understand that part.

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:26.448
There are theories around now,

00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:30.588
the suggestion so we say, that the planet could be a living organism,

00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:32.458
a complete entity?

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:34.268
Of course it is.

00:12:34.348 --> 00:12:37.178
One of the examples of this one, I can give you,

00:12:37.258 --> 00:12:44.244
is that if you sleep under a coconut tree,

00:12:44.324 --> 00:12:47.734
a coconut never falls on anything that is living,

00:12:47.814 --> 00:12:50.344
whether it is a human being or a snake.

00:12:50.424 --> 00:12:51.764
Never falls.

00:12:54.514 --> 00:13:00.459
That is so? Is it all around the world, coconuts never fall on living creatures?

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:02.969
So they understand.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:10.497
We call it as Shri Pala because we think that it is like a brain which understands.

00:13:11.377 --> 00:13:14.572
Well, if this world is a living organism,

00:13:14.652 --> 00:13:16.891
what is the brain? What drives this being,

00:13:16.971 --> 00:13:21.562
this organism? What has made it evolve the way it has?

00:13:21.642 --> 00:13:27.175
There is this subtle power which is all-pervading of God’s love

00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:32.645
which manifests all the things like living work,

00:13:32.725 --> 00:13:36.095
all nourishment, all balancing.

00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:42.435
It’s so balanced if the Pacific was slightly deeper than this,

00:13:42.515 --> 00:13:45.039
there would have been problems.

00:13:46.285 --> 00:13:54.098
If Himalaya was say one and a half times than what it is,

00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:56.278
there would have been problems.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:59.438
So everything is so balanced in nature,

00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:03.338
and the Almighty has created only one world.

00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:06.274
Only we human beings have divided

00:14:06.354 --> 00:14:10.152
and moved like criminals with our passports in our hands.

00:14:11.474 --> 00:14:14.714
Shri Mataji, What we have been talking about,

00:14:14.794 --> 00:14:18.943
many people would regard as a belief or a theory.

00:14:19.023 --> 00:14:24.173
How does one know the difference between truth and a belief?

00:14:24.253 --> 00:14:28.695
First of all anything for which you have to pay money is not the truth.

00:14:28.775 --> 00:14:30.155
You can’t pay for the truth.

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:38.255
If you cancel out that, I think 99.9% of all the falsehood will drop out.

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:42.114
But truth to be really actualised

00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:45.764
you have to have Self Realisation.

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:49.764
Then you feel on your fingertips vibratory awareness.

00:14:49.844 --> 00:14:52.684
A new awareness, a new dimension awareness..

00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:56.794
by which you can make out what is true and what is false.

00:14:56.874 --> 00:15:01.264
That's an absolute truth that you realise at that stage.

00:15:02.974 --> 00:15:06.761
So one must have one’s realisation really to be able, to tell the truth?

00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:11.128
Even to follow anyone, one must have Realisation.

00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:13.606
Shri Mataji thank you very much.

00:15:13.687 --> 00:15:15.066
Thank you.

00:15:17.929 --> 00:15:21.022
Russians are doing wonderfully too.

00:15:21.131 --> 00:15:23.228
Russians are doing wonderfully.

00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:26.096
Shri Mother, I was reading an article just now

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:29.546
where you were talking about inner peace and outer peace?

00:15:29.626 --> 00:15:36.476
This seems to be something that attracts the attention of people in a stressful age.

00:15:38.093 --> 00:15:39.860
By realisation

00:15:42.053 --> 00:15:44.409
what happens, as a result

00:15:44.489 --> 00:15:47.244
you become a person

00:15:47.324 --> 00:15:50.802
endowed with thoughtless awareness.

00:15:50.882 --> 00:15:54.294
That means you see everything.

00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:56.624
You witness everything

00:15:56.704 --> 00:15:59.128
and whenever you want to

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:03.485
say or to think you can see about it

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:08.218
but you don’t react. There is no reaction.

00:16:08.298 --> 00:16:10.111
So you are

00:16:13.441 --> 00:16:21.684
empowered to see it in such a manner

00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:25.664
that there need not be any thought,

00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:30.064
just the whole creation acts on you.

00:16:30.154 --> 00:16:32.644
It’s a very subtle thing.

00:16:32.739 --> 00:16:34.634
It is to be experienced

00:16:34.714 --> 00:16:41.244
and that is the point where we realize that we are the source of peace,

00:16:41.324 --> 00:16:44.882
and that is how our inner peace is established.

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:47.152
Now people have many foundations of peace,

00:16:47.232 --> 00:16:50.682
I have known all of them. They have no peace within themselves.

00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:53.558
Some people have got peace awards

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:56.618
and they're horribly hot-tempered people,

00:16:56.698 --> 00:17:00.088
but they have got peace awards, Noble prizes.

00:17:01.178 --> 00:17:06.943
The peace has to be first of all found inside and then it manifests outside.

00:17:09.503 --> 00:17:13.180
Shri Mataji, another question we wanted to ask you

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.160
is because of this rather useful way,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.890
You use your hands to describe the movements of the chakras when they part

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.515
I wonder if you could just explain why,

00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:32.099
when illness occurs it occurs because of the movement away of one centre from another?

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.325
All right.

00:17:33.406 --> 00:17:37.543
What I try to show them is that this is the left side, this is the right side.

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:40.103
This is the left sympathetic nervous system say

00:17:40.183 --> 00:17:42.733
and this is the right sympathetic nervous system

00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:45.823
and really the spinal cord looks like this,

00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:48.253
and inside here is the spinal cord

00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:50.661
which has the centres in it.

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:51.791
The subtle centres.

00:17:53.391 --> 00:17:56.901
Now when you start using the energy of these centres,

00:17:56.981 --> 00:17:59.801
say too much on the right

00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:03.401
and it starts moving more towards the right

00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.501
and there is a constriction

00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:09.403
and the power becomes less because you are exhausted,

00:18:09.483 --> 00:18:11.403
going more towards the right side.

00:18:11.483 --> 00:18:15.693
Suddenly something happens and from the left, if there is a jerk,

00:18:15.773 --> 00:18:19.325
then the connection is completely broken.

00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:22.971
This is on its own. It starts working on its own.

00:18:23.051 --> 00:18:27.121
That is what you say that this has become malignant.

00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:31.909
It has no relationship with the whole to have proportionate growth

00:18:31.989 --> 00:18:35.749
So if the nose starts developing it can cover your eyes

00:18:35.829 --> 00:18:37.859
and cover your mouth. Everything!

00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:41.329
This is how a cancer is set in or any other disease.

00:18:41.409 --> 00:18:43.644
So many psychosomatic diseases

00:18:43.724 --> 00:18:47.884
are nothing but somatic is from the right side

00:18:47.994 --> 00:18:49.804
and when the psyche gives in,

00:18:49.884 --> 00:18:52.484
then it becomes a psychosomatic disease.

00:18:52.564 --> 00:18:56.474
There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic

00:18:56.554 --> 00:19:01.364
than physical and these we call them as incurable,

00:19:01.444 --> 00:19:05.324
can be easily cured by kundalini awakening

00:19:05.404 --> 00:19:07.985
because when kundalini passes through this,

00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:09.609
she just integrates them.

00:19:09.689 --> 00:19:11.859
For example, she’s going like this

00:19:11.939 --> 00:19:15.999
then she goes into this integrates them.

00:19:16.079 --> 00:19:20.024
Just like she strings them like pearls

00:19:20.104 --> 00:19:25.154
and so they have brought around and also she nourishes that centre.

00:19:25.234 --> 00:19:27.465
That's how people get cured,

00:19:27.545 --> 00:19:30.710
automatically by themselves, by their own power.
