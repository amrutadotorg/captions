00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:09.280
Today there are many new people I see again.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.640
It’s so heartening to see new flowers\h
coming up every day to become the fruits.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:35.040
It’s so joy giving to know that I am here at\h
the right time, when people are really seeking.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.040
They are really seeking to be transformed.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.960
They really believe that\h
something has to happen to them.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.840
They are aware that there’s something\h
lacking in the whole human personality,\h\h

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.160
in the human race, that we cannot overcome\h\h

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.840
the hurdles which look and appear\h
absolutely absurd and illogical.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.600
So many problems we have individually,\h
socially, politically, economically,\h\h

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.080
appear very clearly: it is\h
so evident to understand\h\h

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.360
that the human fibre is lacking in\h
something; that it’s the human beings\h\h

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.400
who are responsible for this chaotic\h
world, for all this modern confusion.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.000
For God has created a\h
beautiful world, I assure you.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.240
It’s really a very beautiful world and\h
He has created you also very beautifully.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.280
You all are very beautiful\h
people, extremely beautiful.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.000
You cannot feel your beauty: then\h
how can others feel your beauty?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:35.840
Because the light that shows\h
your beauty is not there.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:49.840
You have fragrance, which is the\h
fragrance of all the flowers put together.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.320
You are the essence of all the beauties\h\h

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.840
of nature that is created; all the\h
symphonies and all the music that you hear.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.400
All the art that you have\h
created has come from you.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.600
That is your part.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.040
While you are the whole, you are the totality.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.480
But you do not feel your totality,\h
that’s [what] the problem is:\h\h

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.240
that human beings do not feel their totality.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.960
Out of you all this has come up.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.840
All this is your creation.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.120
But you cannot feel that, if your hand\h
has produced something, it’s your hand;\h\h

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:53.040
if your eyes have produced something, these are\h
your eyes; that you are one; that in totality\h\h

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.280
you will know the One who has created you.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.560
For example, supposing I do not have\h
eyes: I may be able to see you partly –\h\h

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.040
in the sense I can feel you – but\h
I won’t be able to see you fully.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:27.840
If I don’t have [a] nose, I won’t be\h
able to know how your fragrance is.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.160
In the same way, if you think of a human\h
being as a part and parcel of the whole,\h\h

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.040
then you can understand why\h\h

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.320
the total experience is necessary.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.400
You have to feel that, sitting\h
down here, you can know about\h\h

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.440
somebody in Australia or maybe in Africa.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.000
We are very aware mentally: [if]\h\h

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.880
anything goes wrong in the world, we all\h
become alert and start thinking about it.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.440
For example, once the spacecraft\h
(Apollo 13) was going to land,\h\h

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.320
they were Americans, but Russians that\h
time started worrying about Americans.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:53.040
All the communists forgot about their communism,\h
the democracies forgot about their democracies.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.160
We all forgot what we are, so-called, [and]\h
we just became what we are – human beings.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.320
Everybody was worried to find\h
that the spacecraft lands.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.680
Very carefully they were watching it.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.640
They were about four, five people.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.480
Makes no difference to this world\h
if the four, five die, does it?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.920
But it does make\h\h

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.360
every heart beat faster.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.880
Something of the totality is getting lost.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.320
It was so important that time, that\h
something so precious was getting lost.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:06.720
This is the subtler understanding\h
of totality we have faced sometimes.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.760
Sometimes it comes up.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.600
To say that, “We are all one,”\h
that, “we are brothers and sisters,”\h\h

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:22.000
and “One God has created us,” is good to\h
give a lecture like that, and many do that.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:41.360
It’s just a big lecture! To feel that you\h
are one, something has to happen to you.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.200
Your heart has to be opened out; not rationally.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.760
Through your brain if you think something,\h\h

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.840
it will have its limitations as\h
rationality has its limitation.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.840
Your heart has to open out.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:08.880
And what resides in that heart, in the lotus\h
of that heart is your Spirit, is your Atma.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:19.120
And the light of that Atma, the Spirit,\h
enlightens you, enlightens your beauty,\h\h

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.800
and gives you collective consciousness.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.840
It gives you.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.560
It’s an actualisation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.720
It’s a happening that gives you [an]\h
actual personality which can perceive,\h\h

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.440
can feel, the collectivity that resides within us.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.520
As human beings we are many cells.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.840
There are many cells within us.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:07.920
All the cells are, somehow, capable of\h
feeling the totality of one personality.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:16.960
Supposing there’s a pin prick on my finger,\h
immediately the whole system goes into\h\h

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:26.160
action and the hand is pulled out, the another\h
hand reaches there and tries to stop the blood.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:38.960
The whole body feels unhappy, and you\h
say, “Ah!” or something like that.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.840
All the cells are in unison,\h
whether there is emergency or not.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:06.000
But today we are in the modern times.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.040
It’s nice to be modern.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:22.400
These are the times promised, long time\h
back, in the ancient scriptures of India.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.840
Even William Blake has prophesised\h
about these times to come:\h\h

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.880
that England is going to be the Jerusalem.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.240
And here we are at Caxton\h
Hall, trying to build it up.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.760
Modern times are the times of great confusion.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.080
The confusion comes because\h
there is no integration.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:04.320
For example, if my finger touches some point\h
where it burns, it is pulled out by itself.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.600
All the cells know that it should be pulled out.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.960
But supposing if it is touching my finger and\h
burning me, and I am again pushing it down,\h\h

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.320
that means there’s a confusion.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.800
And this kind of confusion exists when\h
there is no integration among cells.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.680
In the same way, in the human\h
beings, there are different selves\h\h

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:41.920
and if they get disturbed and non-integrated,\h
or disintegrated, then the confusion starts.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:50.080
When your physical self, mental self,\h
emotional self and spiritual self\h\h

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.600
are not integrated, then there\h
is a confusion in a personality.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:12.560
The growth of human beings has\h
been outside as well as inside.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.560
As you have been growing outside,\h
there has to be growth inside.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:28.160
As a tree grows higher and higher, it\h
has to seek the source of its sustenance.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.720
In the same way,\h\h

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.240
the totality of [the] human race,\h
which has advanced outside too much,\h\h

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:51.920
is seeking; the totality is\h
seeking the source inside.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.160
You are the cells of that\h
totality which is seeking\h\h

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.200
inside and not the ones which are seeking outside.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.840
That’s why I say that you\h
are the seekers of Truth.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.800
Because the source of all the sustenance\h
is the Truth, is the joy, the bliss,\h\h

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040
and the vital Life Force within us,\h\h

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:26.640
which has given us all this power to\h
produce outside, to create outside.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.120
That is why in these modern times\h
only, there are so many seekers.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.560
There were never so many before, I can assure you,\h\h

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.440
because I am quite an ancient\h
personality (laughing).

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.520
And it really gives me the\h
greatest pleasure to know\h\h

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:03.120
that somehow this outward growth has\h
led to this kind of a mass seeking,\h\h

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:15.840
and that there are so many people just\h
ready to reach that point of Source.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.720
As I said, God has made you very beautifully.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.480
Every one of you are real creations.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.560
It’s a fact; which you will discover later on.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.040
Just now, you don’t have any light to see inside.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.320
There is no way you can\h
take your attention inside.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.200
If I say you put your attention inside,\h\h

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.000
you don’t know what to do; and with\h
this many people have gone astray.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.600
There are people\h\h

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:06.640
who have tried all kinds of things to believe that\h
they are going inside, deeper into themselves.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.840
But one has to know one thing,\h\h

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:24.720
that whatever knowledge you have today,\h
has come to you from some unknown source.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.440
Because if it was known, it was not knowledge.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.080
Whatever is unknown has come to your knowledge.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.840
And whatever further has to come,\h
has to come from something unknown.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:56.800
But the difference is that our\h
awareness has come to us spontaneously.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.920
We have done nothing, nothing\h
whatsoever to become human beings.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:15.040
I mean, just think, we were monkeys the other day!\h
Imagine! And we were amoeba the other day, before.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.560
In seven days we have become human beings.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:27.040
How have we become human beings, we don’t know,\h
why we have become human beings, we do not know.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:35.840
But, thank God, through science we know that\h
we were not human beings seven days back.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.160
Why have we become human beings?

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.120
The scientists have stopped thinking about it.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:45.680
They have turned round.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.840
You see, it’s better to turn round, your back.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.800
That’s the best way to avoid the Truth.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.480
Because you cannot find the\h
Truth, you cannot know about it,\h\h

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.320
so best thing is to turn\h
round and say, “All right.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.640
Now we are human beings,\h
so we have reached the end.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.840
Now let us go ahead with it!”

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.840
But that’s not the way you can find the Truth.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:26.400
You will find the Truth the way you have\h
found your awareness, spontaneously.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.080
It’s a living process.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.600
People don’t understand what\h
[the] living process is.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.480
It’s so simple.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.000
If I tell you\h\h

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.760
that, “To make this flower into a fruit I’ll have\h
to stand on my head,” what will you think of me?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.960
You will think I am mad, isn’t it?

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.520
Won’t you think that way, all of you?

00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:03.360
Or if you find somebody sitting in a\h
posture which is very uncomfortable\h\h

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:14.160
and saying that, “I am going into a trip\h
of becoming a superior personality!”\h\h

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.360
You may think, “Oh, he must be a\h
great man!” But just think of it.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:30.640
Do you think that monkeys did some sort of a\h
trick or a technique to become human beings?

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.600
The poor things do not know any techniques\h
except for copying human beings.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.160
And what technique amoeba could have put in?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.320
I mean just think of it.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.400
If you have to apply something to human beings,\h
you have to apply it to all the animals too.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.640
What about the fishes?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.880
What technique they can do?

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.080
They don’t even have hands! (laughter)\h\h

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:09.840
Or, only you are the people who have to do\h
something special to become something higher?

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.200
It’s spontaneous.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.400
The only problem is that human beings\h
are very difficult for spontaneity!\h\h

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.120
I am sometimes surprised, when I have now\h
studied them, how is it that they eat like this.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.880
They could have eaten like this [instead],\h\h

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:38.160
because to do something straight\h
is difficult for human beings.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.360
Anything straightforward, they think,\h
“Oh, how can that be so simple.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.480
It’s silly, to eat like\h
this, it’s absolutely silly.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.240
How can you eat like this?

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.840
You have to put your hand round\h
like that, and eat it like that."

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.520
That’s how we are not spontaneous.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:07.840
All that simplicity is not with us anymore.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.280
We are sophisticated, you see.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.480
I wouldn’t be surprised [if], next time,\h\h

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:21.440
we might find people devising some technique\h
of eating food, which is a simple thing.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.960
And if you see that everybody’s life has\h
become nothing but a bundle of techniques.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.200
It’s such a problem, I tell you.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:43.840
Unnecessarily we are so confused,\h
so upset and so worried.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.840
The tension is mounting up.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.000
We are planning something, and\h
none of the plans come true.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.800
Now, see, in our country we\h
have had five-year plans,\h\h

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:08.280
three of them, the result is everything has\h
gone to waste! In this country, I need not say.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:17.120
We plan out something and end up with a\h
war or end up with some sort of a violence.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.560
The trouble with us [is] we\h
cannot become simple people.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.920
We think to be simple is to be silly.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.920
But simple people have a\h
sharp intelligence, extremely\h\h

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.880
subtle intelligence; and they reach the point\h
much faster than a complicated one, naturally,\h\h

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.600
because he goes straight while the others\h
go round, round, round, round, round.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.440
And that’s why, when I tell\h
people that, “Sahaj Yoga\h\h

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.800
is a spontaneous living\h
process,” they think it is silly.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.520
“Why to do that?”

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.040
You cannot do it.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.680
I am sorry.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.000
It’s your right.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.440
You just have it! You don’t even\h
have to ask permission for it.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.600
Even if you go to somebody’s\h
house, you have to ask permission.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.480
“Should I telephone?”\h\h

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.720
You cannot think of such a right that you don’t\h
have to ask any permission, it’s your own.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.840
It’s your own property.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:41.840
So much [your] own, that you cannot have such\h
a property in the world, in the human language.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.840
Even if you have your ‘freehold’ house,\h\h

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.040
you have to ask for permission for\h
changing the shape of one brick!\h\h

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:54.960
No permission is needed.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.600
It’s your own right.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.720
It’s your birthright.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.160
But still whatever I may say, you won’t understand\h\h

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.640
how much it is your own because\h
there’s nothing that is that own.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:21.840
It’s not comparable.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.960
It is that innate.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:35.840
Something that is beyond human comprehension.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.440
Now, there’s no map (chakra chart) here?

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:56.960
We have within us a being\h
which I call ‘the Spirit’:\h\h

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:09.680
the Spirit which is also the part and parcel of\h
the totality that is love, totality that is God,\h\h

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.360
totality that is joy, totality that is knowledge.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.280
And that Spirit within us is watching us.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.200
It is not watching like a\h
guard or a police inspector.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.480
That also we human beings cannot understand.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.840
If I say the Spirit is watching,\h
people get a fright, “Oh God!”\h\h

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.200
The Spirit is the one that is love.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.840
Can you understand total love?

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:55.600
Can you understand something that just gives\h
and enjoys giving, and not asking for anything?

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.520
Can you understand someone like that?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.840
Can you?

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.080
Loving for love’s sake;\h
that’s what is your Spirit.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:14.840
It is watching you with\h
that love, that total love.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:30.560
That totality of love is watching\h
you to give you that what it is.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:40.720
Now here, I would say, you are the Spirit\h
and you are this self, another one,\h\h

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.040
which is this awareness, this\h
human awareness which you have got.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:57.520
This human awareness has to be\h
enlightened by that totality, that Spirit.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:09.840
When it enlightens that, then only, you know\h
that you are a part and parcel of the totality\h\h

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.640
and that you are beautiful;\h
you are really beautiful.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.480
Sometimes one feels a little bashful\h
to know how beautiful one is,\h\h

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.480
and so fragrant, and so grand and so dignified.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.760
That new dimension one has to achieve.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:44.400
For that, God has placed within you the\h
power, which is the germinating power\h\h

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:52.320
which has to rise and to give you this\h
Realisation: this is your Kundalini.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:00.640
About this in the Bible there is\h
[a] reference of “Tree of Life."

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:11.600
To be nourished by the “water of love."

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.000
This is all prophesised.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.040
That, “He will appear before\h
us as tongues of flames."

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:30.640
Two thousand years back Christ thought\h
it was sufficient [to say this].

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.600
I mean, people didn’t allow\h
Him to speak much, you see.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.720
They just saw to it that He\h
would not explain Himself.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:47.840
Very ‘intelligent’ people.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.440
They could not understand\h
the simplicity of Christ.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:03.120
He was the fundamental, He was the foundation,\h
He was the support of this Universe.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.520
And they crucified Him.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:15.840
Wonderful! He was the Spirit.

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:24.720
He came on this Earth not to\h
teach you what Moses taught you,\h\h

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.360
because Moses had already taught\h
you what was to be taught.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.760
They did not come to repeat the same\h
thing, but to give you a higher idea.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.480
Why?

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.480
Why Moses said that, “Don’t\h
do this and don’t do that!”?

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.280
Why did He say?

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.200
It should have a purpose.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.840
People don’t understand even this much.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.120
Why you should not tell lies?

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:49.360
Why?

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:49.920
What’s wrong?

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.560
Why should you not steal?

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.400
Why should you not commit adultery?

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.040
What’s wrong?

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.320
What goes wrong in it?

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.960
Supposing there were no human\h
laws: there’s nothing wrong in it.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.600
Do as you please! Why these laws were created?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.840
For what purpose?

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:17.520
Because by observing these laws you stay\h
in the centre, you don’t go to extremes.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:29.760
You don’t get lost, you don’t get\h
attacked by negativity, by people who\h\h

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:39.840
are trying to exploit you and to torture you, who\h
are against God, who are against your evolution.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.520
But then, after all, the ultimate is\h\h

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.080
to get your Realisation, to\h
become one with your Spirit.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.920
That’s what it was [for].

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.280
All this show for what?

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.800
For example, in a wedding you arrange\h
everything and everything is bought,\h\h

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.920
and the hall is arranged and is all decorated and\h
everything; people are wearing very nice dresses;\h\h

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.440
and there the bride doesn’t appear.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:11.560
So what?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.360
[So] it’s not a wedding.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.760
What is most important is that both of\h
them should get married in the church\h\h

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.920
where everybody is sitting down, or\h
wherever it is decorated, in a temple;\h\h

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.200
instead of that, all the decoration,\h\h

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.600
if that becomes important and not\h
the wedding, then what’s the use?

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.680
I mean that’s exactly we are doing\h
about our religions, believe me.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.840
I live near one Catholic church\h\h

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.000
and I have lived always near some temple or\h
a church or a mosque, somehow, all my life.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.240
And I have seen them making\h
preparations all the time.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.120
Today they are singing beautiful hymns there.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.880
They have been singing for the last two years.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.600
Nobody’s bothered about their Realisation.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.000
Their parents must have sung.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.120
For generations they are doing the same thing.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.320
Very busy, you know, organising everything.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.960
Very busy, extremely busy, they\h
have no time to talk to anyone.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.040
They are all preparing.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.040
But for what are you preparing, my children?

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.840
What are you seeking?

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:37.600
When are you going to see\h
the bridegroom and the bride?

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.200
That’s what it is: that Christ came on\h
this Earth to give the second phase,\h\h

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:59.840
to show the second phase of evolution, is the\h
resurrection, is the resurrection of your being.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.200
What about that baptism?

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.080
You are to be baptised.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:19.680
He came for that, and how many of us are\h
really seeking a real, actual baptism?

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.080
Again I say you don’t have to\h
do anything about this seeking,\h\h

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.560
you have to just ask for it,\h
and it is going to happen.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.360
It’s going to happen.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.800
It has happened to many, many\h
people all over the world.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.160
In England also it has happened.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.840
Of course, ups and downs\h
are there, but it happens.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:54.240
It should happen to all of you that this Kundalini\h
should rise, should pass through all the centres\h\h

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:02.560
and pierce through your fontanel bone\h
area, and you must get your Realisation.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:12.000
All other nonsensical things that people tell\h
you, all other things that people tell you:\h\h

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:23.920
you may go there if you like, I have no objection.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:32.080
There are people in this country who are\h
doing horrible things like spiritualism.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.160
It’s very bad.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.840
It’s the most dangerous thing.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.160
I mean, the people are honest,\h
so they call it ‘spiritualism’.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.200
Some of them are dishonest,\h
they call it something else.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.480
But people from my country can be very\h
cunning and they call it “guru business”.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.440
Business?

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.160
It is an enterprise, regular enterprise.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.840
If you want to be befooled, I\h
have nothing to say, you go ahead.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.800
If you have so much money, go\h
and pay for their Rolls-Royces.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.080
It’s all right.

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:20.000
If you are interested in yourself,\h
and if you are really interested in\h\h

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.520
knowing your Spirit and manifesting\h
its power of collective consciousness,\h\h

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:35.040
your own power and not the power of the\h
guru, then please stick on to Sahaj Yoga.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.120
It’s a very subtle happening.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.800
It works out.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:48.480
But also one has to know that, after\h
Realisation, you have to have self-esteem.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.680
You have to respect yourself and you have to\h
work it out, otherwise it just disappears.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.000
It’s a very heartening thing.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:13.440
First, when I came to London, I had four\h
people, then six people for four years.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.240
Can you believe it?

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.040
And I was struggling with them.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.680
Because in Sahaj Yoga,\h\h

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.000
now you must have understood, you cannot\h
just pay some money and become the member.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.120
There’s no membership.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.560
How can you have membership for this?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.280
Can you imagine?

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.080
Even the fishes could not have a\h
membership when they wanted to cross over.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:41.760
You cannot become members, you cannot be\h
branded anything, you have to get Realisation\h\h

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.800
by which you start transforming.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.040
It’s a thing that has to happen to you.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.040
It’s not a thing that you\h
can purchase in the market.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.840
I mean, it’s an insult.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.000
How can you pay for it?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.080
I mean just think! People are paying to the\h
tree so that the flower becomes the fruit.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.160
It’s that absurd.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.320
Can you believe it?

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.840
It is really that absurd.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:23.280
But it satisfies some people’s ego I\h
think; which is a stupid stuff, I must say.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.160
If the people were not that egoistical,\h
they would not have, they would never have,\h\h

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.760
crucified Christ.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.040
It’s their ego which crucified Him.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.440
Stupidity, that’s what it was.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:53.840
The One who came for your emancipation\h
was crucified by human beings.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.960
That’s the stupidity of the ego.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:07.840
Or maybe some sort of a stupid or, you can\h
say, silly, belief that by giving 1p (£0.01)\h\h

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.800
to the flower, it will become the fruit.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.120
That means you are naïve.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:30.160
So either it is ego or spiritual naivety that\h
people do all these things and accept them.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.160
You have to accept only\h
the Truth and nothing else.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.840
If it doesn’t happen to you, all right, [but\h
there’s] nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.040
We’ll work it out again.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.880
Maybe there’s something wrong: you are not well;\h
maybe you are suffering; there’s a problem.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:05.440
All right, next time and next time, and\h
next time it’s going to work out that way.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.680
You must have patience with\h
yourself; I have all the patience.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:17.840
Only thing that is needed is patience: no\h
money, no effort, but patience and self-esteem.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.400
I think people who have got Realisation and have\h\h

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.680
stuck on to it, are the people\h
who are really very intelligent.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.800
They could see it so clearly because\h
logically they have reached that point\h\h

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:42.240
and they see that this is it; and they\h
come to it, they get it and maintain it.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:50.880
I think the simplest way to understand\h
Sahaj Yoga is that it’s your growth\h\h

00:38:52.400 --> 00:39:00.000
which is important to you; not what others\h
are doing, what other people are like.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.520
For example, I have seen, also,\h
some people come to Sahaj Yog,\h\h

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.920
get their Realisation and then\h
say, “You see, there was one man,\h\h

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.680
he was a sahaj yogi and he said such\h
and such thing!” What does it matter?

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.400
What does it matter to you?

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.640
What matters to you is your own development.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:25.040
I mean, in the West, people have lots of ways\h
[of escaping] because they are quite brainy\h\h

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:31.040
people and their brain is always thinking, so\h
they will try to find out the way to escape.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.120
But in Sahaj Yoga you do not escape: you stand\h\h

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.960
and see for yourself the Truth,\h
the Reality, in the present.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.440
Don’t escape it, don’t try to escape! That’s the\h
only thing, that’s the only understanding you\h\h

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.720
must have that, “I am not going to escape it!”\h
and not to be afraid or frightened of anything.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:57.920
It is going to work out, and work out for\h
all of you, but do not try to escape it.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.440
There are so many ways and\h
methods! I have seen it myself now,\h\h

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.800
for the last seven years I have\h
been here, can you believe it?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.320
And I have seen how people escaped.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.440
For example, a person may escape by saying,\h\h

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.240
“I had a very bad childhood, and this\h
is what happened in my childhood."

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.440
But I am not concerned with it.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.240
You are all right.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.120
Then somebody might come and say…there was\h
a lady who came to see me and she said,\h\h

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.400
“Mother, I am a prostitute."

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.000
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.640
Come along, let’s try! There can\h
be someone who might say that,\h\h

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.160
“I am not yet ready!” That’s one of the commonest.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.520
Very common.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.560
It’s me who has to decide, not you.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.840
I will know that.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.720
Once you are realised, you will also know.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.880
That doesn’t matter.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:05.840
As I said, to understand\h
totality of love, total love,\h\h

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.200
you have to know that these are all just specks.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:30.080
The ocean, the oceans of oceans, of love\h
will wash off these specks in no time.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.206
But have faith in yourself, that’s all.

00:41:34.206 --> 00:41:36.480
Have faith in yourself.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.840
After all you are human beings.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.360
From amoebic stage you have come to this;\h\h

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:47.840
there must be something special\h
about you, something real about you.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.000
This is one type who tries to escape.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.800
Another is who tries to aggress.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.320
No use, you cannot aggress me: impossible!\h\h

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:12.400
You cannot aggress me because I\h
cannot take anything from you.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.520
If you shout at me: all right, so what?

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.160
I’ll give you love still.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.400
I am that type.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.400
Something queer, isn’t it?

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.320
But I am really like that.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.800
I do not take anything from you.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.880
Can you understand that?

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.360
I do not take your aggression; I cannot take it.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.920
If you aggress me, I absorb it.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.840
I have a shock-absorber.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.880
But by that you are delaying your own improvement.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.200
By the other method of\h
escaping also you are delaying.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.360
Avoid these two things.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.960
It is you who has to gain, not me.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.400
I do not have to gain anything.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.760
I am here to give.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.720
I give because I enjoy that.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.760
I cannot contain within myself.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.880
The time has come for you to\h
enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.360
You have to enter now.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.840
The time has come.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.760
As many as possible have to\h
enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.800
That is your birthright.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:44.400
I have just come here to tell you that and to\h
enlighten you: in the sense [that] the lights\h\h

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.520
which are not yet enlightened are\h
to be enlightened by one light.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.160
And if I am the enlightened light,\h
why should you feel bad about it?

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.760
I wish you could come here and become that.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.440
I wish you could raise the\h
Kundalini and do the job.

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.560
I’ll be very happy.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.920
I wish you could work this way.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:15.120
Oh, I would love to be your disciple! I have\h
no disciples: these are all my children.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:22.000
The eldest one is now only ninety-eight years old.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.600
So, one should not feel hurt,\h
the pride should not be hurt.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:35.840
I am doing all this to make you feel happy, and\h
that you should not be in any way aggressed;\h\h

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.520
in any way you should [not] feel\h
that I am trying to exploit you.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.480
Because that’s the main problem people\h
have that I am trying to exploit.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.560
But what are you going to\h
give me, I would like to know.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.400
Why should I exploit you?

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:57.680
Yesterday somebody asked me this question\h
that, “Maybe, if we become like a child,\h\h

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.080
we might be exploited."

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.840
I said, “The child can never be exploited!\h
You cannot become like a child."

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.920
If somebody is an innocent person, then\h
the innocence is the most powerful thing.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.840
If Christ was crucified, people think [that\h
it’s] because He was innocent He got crucified.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.040
Do you know, He has got powers.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:29.040
In Sanskrit His powers are called as\h
‘Ekadasha Rudra’ – eleven destructive powers.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.720
He’s the most powerful destructive personality.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.880
But He has powers also to control it.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.800
And He is going to come back.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.040
[It’s] not that He is not going to come back.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.840
But this time He is not going to get crucified.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.120
He is coming back with all these powers.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.720
Then He is not going to\h
talk to you or convince you,\h\h

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.200
nothing of the kind, but He is going\h
to work out the other way round.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.520
I have to give you a counsel and tell you,\h\h

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.800
and make you understand that the\h
time has come for you to get this.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:13.840
The sooner you get, the better; the\h
sooner you establish it, the better.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.880
I am sorry today we don’t have the\h
chart to explain to you about Kundalini,\h\h

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:24.160
but these people have got some papers\h
which you can read and understand,\h\h

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.240
and later on, when you get Realisation,\h
work it out and see for yourself.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.400
Do not come here for one day.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:37.360
There are some people who did not get\h
tickets for the drama and have come.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.840
Such people are of no use.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:48.320
You have to be people of\h
some quality, of some level.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.800
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga does not work out.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:52.960
It just spins you out.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:04.960
You see here the question is how many stick on,\h
[it’s] not a question of how many are coming.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.240
Very few people stick on\h
because the quality is judged.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.600
Every moment the quality of people is judged.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:21.040
Every moment your quality is\h
judged, not by me but by yourself.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.200
The quality is judged not by me, but by you.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.040
You yourself will know that you have this problem.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.640
As soon as there is light within,\h
you start seeing the problem yourself\h\h

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.880
and then you know that this is the problem.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.760
And you are not identified with it because you are\h
separated from it and you start curing yourself.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.960
I do not judge you at all.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:51.840
So this is going to happen and when this\h
happens, then know that you have to get\h\h

00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.880
transformed to that beautiful\h
thing which is being promised by\h\h

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:06.960
all the sages, all the scriptures and\h
all the great incarnations on this Earth.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.440
By which you will know how\h
every religion is integrated,\h\h

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:20.400
every incarnation is integrated and how these\h
people are all related to each other and all are\h\h

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:30.080
one family, those who are incarnations; while\h
we are unnecessarily fighting among themselves.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:37.680
And how they are in unison and complete concord\h
among themselves, while we are just fighting\h\h

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.160
that, “This is mine and this is mine."

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:46.080
For this first of all your\h
integration must take place.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.720
And that is a condition.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.920
If it does not take place,\h
again we’ll work it out.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:57.280
We cannot argue it out, we\h
cannot do anything of that kind.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.840
It has to work out.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.000
One thing I would request.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.920
Yesterday we had a little problem\h
with someone who came quite drunk.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.680
It is the awareness which\h
is going to be enlightened.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.840
If you are drunk it’s going to be difficult.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.400
If anybody who is drunk in\h
this group, please be careful.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.280
You better go at the back, if you are drunk.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:30.320
I don’t know if drunk people\h
know that they are drunk or not.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:38.400
But the fellow was drunk, no doubt, and everybody\h
told me that he’s drunk and it was horribly bad.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:45.040
So I would request you, such a person\h
who is drunk should go at the back,\h\h

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.320
and somebody else will work.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.520
They need little intensive understanding.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.560
So this is what it is.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.840
We are now going to start this program.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.680
There’s no technique, nothing.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:12.560
Just your fingers are like antennae and they have\h
the ends which have got sympathetic nervous system\h\h

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.760
expressed and manifested there.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:26.080
We have to just get them enlightened\h
so that the invitation to Kundalini\h\h

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:31.120
goes through your channels within yourself –\h
which I cannot explain to you but you might have\h\h

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:37.920
seen in the paper – and that the Kundalini\h
rises and that you get your Realisation.

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.960
The first thing that happens to you,\h\h

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.280
when the Kundalini rises above this\h
centre, this is the centre of Christ.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.400
And He has done all the thinking for\h
us; we unnecessarily are thinking.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.240
He’s done everything for us, there’s\h
no need for us to suffer or to think.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.800
That part He has crossed.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.600
Now it is better that we have to enter into\h
the Kingdom of God, that’s all we have to do.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:09.200
So when the Kundalini rises above this,\h
you will feel thoughtlessly aware.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.880
That means you will be aware,\h
but there won’t be any thought.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.640
It’s called as nirvichar samadhi.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:17.920
Sama-dhi.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.720
‘Samadhi’ means ‘enlightened awareness’,\h
‘nirvichar’ means ‘thoughtless’.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.360
And then it pierces through\h
your fontanel bone area.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:37.280
You start feeling a cool breeze\h
coming towards you, from me.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.720
But later on you find it’s going from you.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.640
This should happen.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.520
This is the Cool Breeze of the Holy\h
Ghost as described in the Bible.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.720
Of course, if there are Hindus…I\h\h

00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.000
don’t know [if] they read these days, normally\h
they don’t read any one of their ancient books.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:10.720
But if they have read anything about Adi\h
Shankaracharya – he has written volumes\h\h

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.280
on this cool breeze, which\h
he calls as Saundarya Lahari,\h\h

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:23.760
or Chaitanya Lahari, meaning ‘the waves\h
of beauty’ and the ‘waves of Chaitanya’.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.000
What is it, Gavin, in English?

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.520
Chaitanya – is the vital, Divine Force.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.120
‘Chetana’ means ‘awareness’, and cheteeta\h
is the person who is enlightened.

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:54.880
And the one who emits these vibrations, cool\h
vibrations; is the one who is a realised-soul.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.760
We have many children in this\h
country who are born-realised.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.920
And I have met some human beings\h
also who are born-realised,\h\h

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.000
but they are rather difficult\h
people, I don’t know why.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:14.080
Though they are born-realised, they get possessed\h
by their ego sometimes and they are not that\h\h

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:19.920
evolved as they should be and they\h
start behaving in a very queer manner.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:27.200
And their behaviour can be sometimes\h
so shocking that it’s most surprising.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.600
And they mesmerise people and they take\h
to all these things to assert their\h\h

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.720
influence on other people.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:43.920
It is a very surprising thing that those who\h
did not get Realisation through Sahaj Yog,\h\h

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.720
and were born-realised, have not been\h
able to express themselves sometimes.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:59.840
And then they felt that they had a\h
knowledge which was not complete about it.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.480
And they felt they were\h
different, and they tried to\h\h

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:10.320
assert on others their ways and methods by\h
learning mesmerism and things like that.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.360
It’s most surprising.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.560
But we have someone here already who is a\h
realised-soul, who is here, who was possessed;\h\h

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.040
who came here, got cured and she is all right now.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.720
So even if you are Realised, you can be possessed.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.520
But in Sahaj Yoga, the\h
advantage is, after Realisation,\h\h

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:35.040
you know all the techniques of the Divine\h
Force, which is flowing through you.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.000
That means when you have to have the\h
energy, you have to put to the mains.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.760
But once you get the energy in you,\h
you should know how to manoeuvre it.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:48.240
Then you know how to protect yourself, you know\h
how to improve yourself, how to cure others,\h\h

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:54.960
how to give Realisation to others, how to awaken\h
others, and everything you know, all the secrets;\h\h

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:05.920
and the most secret techniques of\h
the Divine Force are told to you.

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:09.280
Of course it is all learned gradually by you,\h\h

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:16.880
and you cannot pay for it,\h
because you cannot value it.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.880
It’s not human.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.640
It is Divine.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:33.840
Thank you very much.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:47.840
Can you put your hands towards me like this.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.480
And you have to close your eyes.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:58.400
It is just the opposite of mesmerism,\h
in a way, because people who mesmerise,\h\h

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.840
they just look into your eyes or\h
some sort of a thing like that.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.080
It’s very common; nonsensical.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.120
Please, close your eyes.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.200
Just close your eyes.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.880
It’s going to work out in no time today.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:26.640
You don’t have to try anything, that’s one thing.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.840
You don’t have to try.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.600
Just leave your attention free, absolutely free.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.120
Do not try anything.

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:41.320
If thoughts are coming, I’ll tell you what\h
is to be done, but just don’t try anything.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.840
Normally most of you will feel the thoughtless\h
awareness, that’s the easiest thing.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:54.320
But supposing if thoughts are coming, then\h
you just say, “I forgive all the people."

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.000
“Mother, I forgive all the people,” that’s all.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.360
That, if you say, Christ is awakened within you.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.000
Can you imagine?

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.120
Just say, “I forgive."

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.840
“Mother, I forgive."

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.320
Say it thrice.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.480
From your heart you must say.

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.680
After all, there’s nothing in forgiving.

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:28.320
By not forgiving you are just heavy\h
laden with nonsensical things.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:39.840
Just say, “I forgive,” and you will\h
be surprised how light you will feel.

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:55.200
Do not pay attention to any particular point.

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.520
Let it go.

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:03.840
Let it go.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.920
Also not to feel guilty.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.080
Please, do not feel guilty;\h
that’s an escape again.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.960
Not to feel guilty, as I have told you.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.760
What wrong can you do?

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:39.040
So just say, “Mother, I am not guilty."

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.880
Please say that, that’s very important.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.040
Say it thrice.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.840
It will help you.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:45.983
Just watch!

00:59:45.983 --> 00:59:46.113
Try this.

00:59:46.114 --> 00:59:47.118
(Mother is presumably demonstrating how\h
to hold the hand above the Sahasrara)

00:59:47.118 --> 00:59:47.535
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:59:47.535 --> 00:59:47.639
Not yet?

00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:48.382
Just keep them like this: a\h
little higher, little higher.

00:59:48.382 --> 00:59:48.682
Now are you feeling it?

00:59:48.682 --> 00:59:49.073
Gavin, remove this photograph.

00:59:49.073 --> 00:59:49.803
[If] somebody can remove the\h
photograph would be better.

00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:49.986
Just move it.

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:50.182
I can’t see.

00:59:50.181 --> 00:59:50.364
My photograph.

00:59:50.364 --> 00:59:50.573
Just remove it.

00:59:50.573 --> 00:59:50.847
That’s better, yes.

00:59:50.846 --> 00:59:51.354
Let’s see on the heads of the people.

00:59:51.355 --> 00:59:52.568
Some people can feel the cool breeze coming out\h
of their heads, but not in the hands, maybe.

00:59:52.567 --> 00:59:52.697
Just see.

00:59:52.698 --> 00:59:52.854
Cool or hot.

00:59:52.854 --> 00:59:53.271
No, just a little higher: there?

00:59:53.272 --> 00:59:53.767
Some people are feeling, some are not.

00:59:53.767 --> 00:59:54.132
Just again see for yourself.

00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:54.771
Gavin, let’s just see just how many people are.

00:59:54.771 --> 00:59:55.840
Now we have here some of the people\h
who are Realised and let them see.
