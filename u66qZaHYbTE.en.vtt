00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:03.076
Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.673
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:17.088
to be with you all again this year.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:38.644
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.796
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

00:00:55.996 --> 00:01:00.144
that is the Devi.

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:22.518
You know within us there are many powers

00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:30.632
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:49.166
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:27.455
If these powers are properly used and understood,

00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:34.515
then your ascent can be permanent.

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:46.631
Once you achieve your ascent

00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.404
and enter into the kingdom of God,

00:02:50.604 --> 00:02:55.237
all these powers get enlightened.

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:10.675
And these powers which are enlightened

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:19.039
are absolutely filled with Love.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:33.665
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:39.029
we get completely enlightened by Love.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.328
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:56.622
we use only one power which is of Love.

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:11.815
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:21.685
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:29.208
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:45.184
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:56.201
But once you get your enlightenment

00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:01.373
you realise that your love becomes

00:05:01.573 --> 00:05:08.502
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:26.343
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:41.329
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.583
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:52.708
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

00:05:52.908 --> 00:05:59.020
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

00:06:08.564 --> 00:06:11.700
And that is how you develop

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:19.921
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.456
If you are too much attached to your body,

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:30.703
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

00:06:30.903 --> 00:06:33.842
or you may exercise too much

00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:41.856
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:57.575
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

00:06:57.775 --> 00:07:01.978
or sinful things also.

00:07:06.581 --> 00:07:09.975
But then you become enlightened

00:07:10.175 --> 00:07:16.244
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

00:07:21.986 --> 00:07:29.385
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

00:07:29.585 --> 00:07:34.835
all that is destructive for your body.

00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:47.957
The another attachment we have is very limited,

00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:52.458
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:57.304
for your husband, something like that.

00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:10.444
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

00:08:10.645 --> 00:08:13.237
and could only bother about himself

00:08:13.437 --> 00:08:18.702
and first of all him and then the rest.

00:08:27.937 --> 00:08:32.506
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

00:08:32.706 --> 00:08:41.857
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.834
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:03.283
or drugs or all kinds of things.

00:09:07.565 --> 00:09:16.384
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

00:09:23.335 --> 00:09:29.655
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

00:09:33.731 --> 00:09:38.373
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

00:09:38.574 --> 00:09:45.761
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

00:09:54.283 --> 00:09:59.161
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:02.395
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

00:10:02.595 --> 00:10:07.143
nor for my family, nor my relations.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:22.117
After enlightenment you think collectively.

00:10:24.788 --> 00:10:28.752
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

00:10:28.952 --> 00:10:34.632
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.834
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

00:10:48.034 --> 00:10:52.120
and to their destructiveness.

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:06.745
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.596
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

00:11:14.796 --> 00:11:18.920
and how noble you are.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:33.027
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:37.777 --> 00:11:42.649
In that noble understanding of life

00:11:42.849 --> 00:11:51.612
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:57.163
and try to bring them to the right path.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:14.301
At the same time when they are helping their families

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:20.302
and try to improve their understanding,

00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:26.647
they can be also very particular as to see that

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:36.598
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:50.334
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

00:12:54.803 --> 00:12:59.707
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

00:13:02.473 --> 00:13:07.145
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:12.372
goes up into the smallest of leaves

00:13:12.572 --> 00:13:19.215
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

00:13:29.936 --> 00:13:33.127
It doesn’t stay in one flower

00:13:33.327 --> 00:13:40.713
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

00:13:47.401 --> 00:13:51.529
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

00:13:51.729 --> 00:13:56.050
and is not attached.

00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:07.939
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:11.627
or in one leaf, the tree will die

00:14:11.827 --> 00:14:16.655
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

00:14:24.616 --> 00:14:32.444
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.327
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

00:14:42.527 --> 00:14:49.816
and the goodness of the tree.

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:59.428
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

00:14:59.628 --> 00:15:03.327
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

00:15:03.527 --> 00:15:07.557
towards everything.

00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:20.075
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

00:15:23.184 --> 00:15:26.601
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:31.856
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:39.776
Because hundred years back

00:15:39.977 --> 00:15:43.615
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

00:15:43.815 --> 00:15:48.536
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

00:15:54.692 --> 00:15:58.579
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:05.794
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

00:16:14.232 --> 00:16:17.848
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

00:16:18.048 --> 00:16:21.598
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

00:16:21.798 --> 00:16:27.556
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

00:16:27.756 --> 00:16:32.728
and do some service for the Russians.

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:51.370
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:17:02.986
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:03.186 --> 00:17:08.365
we have to use only our power of Love.

00:17:13.785 --> 00:17:21.864
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:30.059
Because this is Divine Love.

00:17:32.413 --> 00:17:34.791
We are getting the source of Divine Love

00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:40.444
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

00:17:45.849 --> 00:17:49.857
They say that God is Almighty.

00:17:52.312 --> 00:17:56.929
Then who can be more powerful than God?

00:17:59.546 --> 00:18:02.820
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.247
who could be mightier than us?

00:18:11.817 --> 00:18:18.454
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

00:18:18.654 --> 00:18:24.695
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

00:18:32.429 --> 00:18:39.694
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.882
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:52.793
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

00:18:59.155 --> 00:19:01.755
And when I came out after five minutes

00:19:01.956 --> 00:19:06.068
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

00:19:09.795 --> 00:19:18.319
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:26.480
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:35.842
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

00:19:41.608 --> 00:19:45.758
No one can harm you.

00:19:46.555 --> 00:19:52.047
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

00:19:56.704 --> 00:20:00.181
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

00:20:00.389 --> 00:20:02.675
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:08.042
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

00:20:08.242 --> 00:20:13.786
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

00:20:22.948 --> 00:20:25.591
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:30.861
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:36.279
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

00:20:46.867 --> 00:20:52.347
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

00:20:52.547 --> 00:20:58.708
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

00:21:07.197 --> 00:21:11.965
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

00:21:12.165 --> 00:21:19.789
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

00:21:24.608 --> 00:21:32.756
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

00:21:36.158 --> 00:21:43.838
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

00:21:44.038 --> 00:21:48.132
for every human being in the world.

00:21:53.182 --> 00:21:57.045
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

00:21:57.245 --> 00:22:02.896
who are suffering, who need help.

00:22:08.648 --> 00:22:11.776
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:17.243
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

00:22:23.443 --> 00:22:28.805
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

00:22:29.005 --> 00:22:35.639
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

00:22:42.443 --> 00:22:47.662
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

00:22:47.863 --> 00:22:53.791
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

00:23:01.077 --> 00:23:05.094
So who will fight?

00:23:05.294 --> 00:23:09.696
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

00:23:09.896 --> 00:23:15.495
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

00:23:24.639 --> 00:23:30.544
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

00:23:30.744 --> 00:23:37.182
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:52.897
And their fragrance is their Love.

00:23:56.257 --> 00:24:00.479
And they have all to become fruits now.

00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:05.567
And this is what is going to happen

00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:10.623
as these times are very, very important.

00:24:15.326 --> 00:24:19.701
In all the religions they are described.

00:24:21.742 --> 00:24:25.964
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:33.011
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

00:24:41.827 --> 00:24:45.666
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:50.140
and individual becomes the collective.

00:24:57.034 --> 00:25:00.534
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

00:25:00.734 --> 00:25:04.867
by the all pervading power.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:18.224
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

00:25:18.424 --> 00:25:22.682
of handling everything.

00:25:30.025 --> 00:25:36.469
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:44.192
that only by having Love for others,

00:25:44.392 --> 00:25:48.348
and this enlightened Love

00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:54.289
is going to give you whatever you want.

00:26:02.112 --> 00:26:07.018
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

00:26:13.391 --> 00:26:17.606
There is no doubt about it.

00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:22.061
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

00:26:22.261 --> 00:26:27.925
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

00:26:34.187 --> 00:26:38.042
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:44.182
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

00:26:50.123 --> 00:26:55.251
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

00:26:55.451 --> 00:26:59.482
let others also enjoy."

00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:11.615
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:15.154 --> 00:27:21.175
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

00:27:21.375 --> 00:27:24.550
they try to convince people,

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:30.542
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.479
But the greatest joy is when you see that

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:44.854
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

00:27:45.054 --> 00:27:49.734
and given him self-realisation.

00:27:56.606 --> 00:28:01.795
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

00:28:07.399 --> 00:28:12.837
Let this Love grow more and more.

00:28:16.085 --> 00:28:21.499
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

00:28:25.069 --> 00:28:33.451
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

00:28:33.651 --> 00:28:38.232
but for My children who are here.

00:28:44.997 --> 00:28:49.393
May God bless you.
