00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:06.350
Whether we believe in the
Supreme Spirit (Paramatma) or not,

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:12.491
It doesn't depend on our belief
whether the Supreme Spirit exists or not.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:15.865
And even if

00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:20.122
we keep telling you that the
Supreme Spirit (Paramatma) exists,

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:22.571
और आप उसका विश्वास भी करलें,
And you believe in it,"

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.873
It still won't make any difference.

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:31.469
Even if you disbelieve,
you will do so in ignorance,"

00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:35.299
And even when you believe,
you are still in ignorance.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.457
Believing in it without
experiencing it is also ignorance."

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:49.013
And disbelieving in it is
also a sign of ignorance.

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:50.894
Therefore...

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:53.935
You should approach it with an open mind,

00:00:54.597 --> 00:00:56.805
You should approach it with an open mind,

00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.096
Like a scientist,

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:01.891
A researcher,

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.157
Who knows nothing,

00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:07.592
Who doesn't have any preconceived ideas,

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:09.526
Who hasn't already made up their mind,

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:11.549
In the same way, you should perceive it.

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:14.282
Regarding this topic...

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.765
Who knows how many books
have been written by humans,

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:21.330
It’s like an endless ocean,

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:24.414
And out of that, who knows how many
people have written only falsehoods;

00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:26.238
All falsehood has been written;

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:34.454
But what is the difference
between truth and falsehood?

00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:41.015
The mark of truth is that it
reveals itself in every situation,

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:48.142
And it never proves to be false
under any test; that is what truth is.

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:52.494
Whatever we discuss with you,

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:54.702
Or whatever we tell you,

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:59.695
Listening to it like a scientist means,

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:03.887
That we are presenting a
hypothesis, an idea before you,

00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:07.492
And later we can prove that idea to you;

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:14.399
And those who are sitting
here, who have seen our work,

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.740
They know that this can be proven.

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:22.442
But keeping an open mind,

00:02:23.754 --> 00:02:24.794
Is very important,

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.670
Because many of you have
read a lot on this subject;

00:02:30.993 --> 00:02:32.673
It doesn't take much to write,

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:35.153
If you have a little money or

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.239
Someone is ready to help you a bit.

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:41.943
So, you can keep writing book after book,

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.382
And there's no need to seek the truth.

00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:49.633
In matters of religion, who is there
 to ask why you wrote something?

00:02:50.586 --> 00:02:52.895
In religion, anyone can
say whatever they want,

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:57.464
Even people like Hitler spoke about
religion, and so did people like Napoleon,

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:01.464
Because In the matters
of religion, You can even

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.114
sell unrighteousness
in the name of religion,

00:03:03.498 --> 00:03:05.723
Where is the law that catches them yet?

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.188
Whosoever will, sell
unrighteousness in the name of religion,

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:15.342
And there's no law yet
to put them in jail for it.

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:20.615
But if you are a worshiper of truth...

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.790
And if you want to know the truth,

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:27.234
You should not fully
believe even what we say.

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:28.485
Until you

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.251
see for yourself that
what we are saying is real;

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.240
You are human, and you should
stand firm in your self-respect,

00:03:37.243 --> 00:03:41.634
Not letting yourself be overwhelmed
by whatever someone tells or writes to you.

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:44.937
That is not a sign of humanity at all.

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:48.138
A person who, standing on their own,

00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:55.427
tells God that 'You do not exist,'

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:57.170
Is far better

00:03:57.597 --> 00:04:00.988
Than the one who says
to God, 'Yes, You exist.'

00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:05.795
In Sahaja Yoga, we don't engage
 with people who are dependent on others.

00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.363
Yesterday, I told you that in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.333
Your innocence is very important;

00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.790
But independence is extremely necessary.

00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:23.082
And so, you must sit with an
extremely independent mind,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.949
Neither accepting us,

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:29.489
Nor rejecting us,

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:33.570
until you have
 experienced it yourself.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.708
Whatever we are saying,

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:43.158
Until you achieve self-realization,
you cannot understand.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:46.352
You simply cannot know it,

00:04:46.763 --> 00:04:48.637
Whatever it is that we are saying.

00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:56.212
Just like if you don't have a connection,

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:59.546
Making any phone call is meaningless.

00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:03.497
At the very least,

00:05:04.356 --> 00:05:08.200
At the very least, when a person
 wants to know about religion,

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:11.208
Realization is the minimum required state;

00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:13.679
Before that, a person

00:05:15.146 --> 00:05:17.854
Is not worthy of understanding religion.

00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:19.802
As  in our country, it was said in the past

00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:22.038
That only a Brahmin
could understand religion;

00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:25.089
But the meaning of 'Brahmin' was
 someone who is realized.

00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:27.832
Not every person was considered a Brahmin.

00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:36.785
Today, I told you that

00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.455
I will will take up the concepts of
*Prashta Brahma* and other topics.

00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:42.401
That will be discussed.

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:46.183
I have explained before

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.231
That just like a seed,

00:05:49.658 --> 00:05:51.000
Within it,

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:55.982
The blueprint of everything that will
 emerge from it is present,

00:05:57.283 --> 00:06:00.674
In the same way, consider the
 idea of a Brahman essence,

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.023
That there is a seed of Brahman essence,

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:07.740
Which has no beginning and no end,

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:10.743
Because the tree comes from the seed,
 and the seed comes from the tree,

00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.222
Which is eternal.

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:17.414
Brahm In such a seed form,

00:06:19.574 --> 00:06:22.415
You are standing in your awareness.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.946
This Brahman...

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:29.038
The state is like an ordinary seed

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:30.899
which

00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:34.805
is endowed with

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:37.372
creative power,

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:41.088
just like a small seed has

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:46.052
its germinating power or
its creative power within it.

00:06:46.715 --> 00:06:50.319
Similarly, this Brahma
also has its creative power.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.444
And when it first bursts forth,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.630
when it first starts to vibrate,

00:06:57.275 --> 00:06:59.517
when it first vibrates,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100
then

00:07:07.175 --> 00:07:10.516
the establishment of Pranava occurs,
 the establishment of that power happens.

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:16.868
And that power, detaching
itself from the seed,

00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:22.254
establishes itself in its ego
and creates the entire Earth.

00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:27.159
And the seed, assuming the form of God,
observes this play.

00:07:28.707 --> 00:07:31.432
Just like a television
is kept, He watches it,

00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:35.886
if He likes the play, He watches it,

00:07:36.165 --> 00:07:38.565
and if He doesn’t like
it, He switches it off.

00:07:41.303 --> 00:07:45.311
This very God is known in our
scriptures by the name of Shiva.

00:07:47.275 --> 00:07:50.341
And that power is called Shivani.

00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:54.388
We refer to it as Mahashiva,

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:57.929
and others call it Supreme, Father, God,

00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:04.008
Paramatma, and the Holy Ghost.

00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:05.751
Others

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:08.085
call it the Holy Ghost,

00:08:10.527 --> 00:08:12.887
soul, and various other names.

00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:14.592
We refer to it as Mahashiva.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:18.154
This very power creates all of creation.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.184
When this power begins to create,

00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:25.181
at that time,

00:08:27.489 --> 00:08:29.681
it creates in its own manner,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.400
it has its own way.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.562
When it reaches the human state,

00:08:39.045 --> 00:08:41.603
this power, as I told you yesterday,

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:44.040
is a material element

00:08:49.624 --> 00:08:52.448
and one is conscious;

00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:57.284
these two elements
create the entire universe.

00:08:58.714 --> 00:09:01.935
When the conscious element
works on the material element,

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:04.838
then the creation of the universe happens,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.570
and the entire universe is formed.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.798
Continuing, we reach the human state.

00:09:12.227 --> 00:09:15.013
I have explained this in detail many times,

00:09:15.197 --> 00:09:17.651
but today I specifically
want to focus on Kundalini,

00:09:18.084 --> 00:09:20.509
so I want to reach there quickly.

00:09:22.838 --> 00:09:24.562
When the material power in humans

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:32.631
in the form of a small
child, in the mother's womb,

00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:36.951
in the stage of two to three
years, or two to three months,

00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:41.743
vibrates for the first time,

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:44.649
at that moment, in its heart,

00:09:45.044 --> 00:09:46.324
the first vibration that occurs,

00:09:46.812 --> 00:09:50.735
the first vibration that happens
in the child’s heart is of God.

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:53.289
That is what we call the soul.

00:09:54.403 --> 00:09:58.011
Paramatma first manifests in
our body in the form of the soul.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.398
And the power, from our head,

00:10:03.094 --> 00:10:06.169
pierces through the crown region and enters

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.757
into our spine,

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.370
which is the spinal cord,

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:16.558
and passes through it,

00:10:16.842 --> 00:10:18.094
and in the triangular shape

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.964
settles in this sacrum bone.

00:10:25.797 --> 00:10:28.522
Whether it settles there or not,
whether it exists there or not,

00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:31.363
what is its state,
whether it is real or not,

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:33.109
you might ask, why should we believe it?

00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:34.309
You shouldn't believe it at all,

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:35.612
but I can show it to you.

00:10:36.862 --> 00:10:40.382
Even if you are not realized, if
you have eyes, if you are not blind,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.924
then you can see,

00:10:42.134 --> 00:10:44.586
that the Kundalini is situated there,

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.405
that it is situated there as Kundalini,

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.657
and immediately it starts vibrating there,

00:10:48.924 --> 00:10:50.799
even in the triangular bone.

00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:56.098
There is no reason for a
triangular bone to vibrate,

00:10:56.215 --> 00:10:57.575
because there is no heart there,

00:10:59.457 --> 00:11:00.657
there is no heart there,

00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:02.640
But there

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.215
you can see that, if the person
 is wearing any clothing,

00:11:06.442 --> 00:11:07.926
it moves up and down,

00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:10.434
and sometimes it moves very vigorously.

00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:15.080
Then you see that when this thing rises up.

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:17.343
While it's rising up,

00:11:18.554 --> 00:11:22.307
it pulsates at certain places,

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:26.715
and in some places, the
pulsation is so intense and visible	,

00:11:26.745 --> 00:11:28.998
that, like at the heart
chakra, where it's at the back,

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:31.481
Here you may seem that
 as if the cloth is lifting up.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.690
It is lifting up.

00:11:34.892 --> 00:11:36.129
For this, whatever, we

00:11:37.283 --> 00:11:39.495
conducted the experiments and tests,

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.228
That people have
witnessed with their own eyes.

00:11:44.694 --> 00:11:46.833
Those who say that
Kundalini does not exist,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.691
who do not believe in Kundalini,

00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:51.986
should come once and see for themselves

00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:56.674
that there is something
called Kundalini within you,

00:11:57.141 --> 00:12:00.395
there is something
called Shakti within you,

00:12:00.529 --> 00:12:04.565
and it is in your triangular
bone, not anywhere else.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.840
You can witness it directly.

00:12:10.365 --> 00:12:15.079
You can see with your own naked
 eyes that Kundalini is within you.

00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:19.584
After that,

00:12:20.568 --> 00:12:21.768
you also see

00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:26.371
that slowly, it feels like
something is moving in your back.

00:12:27.238 --> 00:12:31.612
For some, just by looking at us, it
feels as if something is moving quickly.

00:12:32.712 --> 00:12:35.896
This is due to the merits
accumulated in their previous lives.

00:12:39.564 --> 00:12:41.538
The merits they have gathered

00:12:42.856 --> 00:12:44.214
manifest instantly

00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:47.055
and the Kundalini rises forcefully.

00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:52.714
And for some, there are obstructions.

00:12:52.947 --> 00:12:55.758
It rises slowly, then goes
back down, and some feel heat.

00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:02.471
The reason for this is that within you,

00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:06.419
the path of the Kundalini is

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.395
as I am showing you here,

00:13:10.883 --> 00:13:11.883
like this,

00:13:13.891 --> 00:13:14.891
related to a hole

00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:18.424
as if it can be pulled
from here and from there.

00:13:19.308 --> 00:13:20.668
You see this, right?

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:23.845
These two other powers are within us,

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:27.053
which are Ida and Pingala; I
will talk about them tomorrow.

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:31.976
Due to some reason or another,

00:13:34.277 --> 00:13:35.277
they pull

00:13:35.802 --> 00:13:37.476
this path towards themselves,

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.430
and because of this, the
path becomes blocked,

00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:44.721
and the Kundalini cannot rise,

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:47.317
it gets stuck where the path is blocked.

00:13:49.004 --> 00:13:51.873
This Kundalini is the
manifest Chaitanya Shakti.

00:13:52.573 --> 00:13:54.864
I explained about
Chaitanya to you yesterday,

00:13:55.243 --> 00:13:56.872
that Chaitanya knows everything.

00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:00.272
Chaitanya recognizes everything.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:05.507
Not only that, but the entire creation
of the universe is done by Chaitanya.

00:14:06.453 --> 00:14:09.103
And Chaitanya is love.

00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:10.899
This Kundalini is also

00:14:11.099 --> 00:14:13.840
the embodiment of love, your own mother.

00:14:14.513 --> 00:14:16.033
There is a slight difference,

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:20.673
your own mother has no other child;

00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:23.343
she knows everything about you.

00:14:23.538 --> 00:14:27.029
Like a tape recorder, she has recorded

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.379
everything within her,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.920
what faults this child has,

00:14:30.272 --> 00:14:31.396
what difficulties it faces,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.210
what pain is in its body,

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:34.979
what suffering its mother has,

00:14:35.058 --> 00:14:36.738
what troubles it has gone through.

00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:39.471
This is all manifest,

00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:43.408
In today’s modern era,

00:14:43.575 --> 00:14:45.783
if anyone talks about
Kundalini, people will mock them.

00:14:51.103 --> 00:14:52.336
But in these times, while you

00:14:52.403 --> 00:14:54.736
are waving the thousand
huge banners of science,

00:14:55.871 --> 00:14:57.425
the moment has come

00:14:57.642 --> 00:14:59.941
that you will again

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:03.591
have to look up towards the path of Dharma,

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.986
because science has now realized

00:15:06.183 --> 00:15:07.863
that what we have known so far.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:16.058
In medical science, cancer...

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.808
What is cancer? No one really understands.

00:15:22.498 --> 00:15:26.483
Those who boast about
science with pride and arrogance,

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.601
let them explain cancer to me.

00:15:31.357 --> 00:15:32.857
There are many great doctors,

00:15:33.814 --> 00:15:35.306
but they can't explain it.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.914
I'll tell you, cancer is exactly
what I said earlier, that...

00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:41.294
...due to the Sympathetic Nervous System,

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:44.186
the actions there of...

00:15:44.744 --> 00:15:46.823
due to it’s overactivity

00:15:47.281 --> 00:15:48.926
it happens, and there is no cure for it

00:15:48.973 --> 00:15:51.114
...other than Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:51.176 --> 00:15:53.747
Today, I’m saying this; people
might accept it after ten years,

00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:57.188
...but by then, who knows how many
people will be afflicted with cancer.

00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:02.411
The world is strange,

00:16:02.794 --> 00:16:04.423
...when you discover something,

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:09.064
...the human mind is such that it
finds something, and then hangs him,

00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:11.410
...ignores him.

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:14.197
But after death,

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.930
...temples will be built for them, and

00:16:16.002 --> 00:16:17.143
...they will be honored.

00:16:18.793 --> 00:16:21.039
Today, while I am alive, I’m telling you

00:16:21.123 --> 00:16:24.293
...what this disease called cancer is.

00:16:24.377 --> 00:16:27.562
I say it's the overactivity of the
Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:30.120
Even doctors are now ready to listen.

00:16:31.683 --> 00:16:33.836
But if one or two doctors
get cancer themselves,

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:35.486
...they come to Mataji’s feet.

00:16:35.921 --> 00:16:37.628
...But then, Mataji doesn’t have time.

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:40.825
Because I am

00:16:41.283 --> 00:16:44.241
...more focused on realization, not cancer.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.817
But if doctors would open their eyes

00:16:50.617 --> 00:16:52.297
...and try to understand this,

00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:57.806
...and not worry about what
will happen to their money,

00:17:00.803 --> 00:17:03.911
...then they themselves
could treat this disease,

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:06.868
...and heal people.

00:17:13.466 --> 00:17:16.224
The scientific approach about Kundalini,

00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:18.149
If you want to ask...

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:22.516
then I would say, you
believe in your eyes, don't you?

00:17:23.067 --> 00:17:25.267
If you do, then see with your eyes

00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:27.620
...that if under someone's lower back bone,

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:29.824
there is a pulsation

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.977
After all, what is that?

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:38.786
And after it happens,

00:17:39.664 --> 00:17:41.272
...while you are fully aware,

00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:43.720
...if this state of thoughtlessness
is being established

00:17:43.772 --> 00:17:47.430
...then what is that thing that
is making you thoughtless?

00:17:48.042 --> 00:17:50.287
Ask the biggest
psychologists if they can

00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:53.233
establish this state of
thoughtlessness within us.

00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:57.335
They might your breath and calm your mind,

00:17:57.768 --> 00:18:00.796
...but if they can bring you to
that inner silence and peace

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.594
...while you are fully conscious, then

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.602
...we will agree that
your science is great.

00:18:08.228 --> 00:18:11.535
Without inner peace, we
cannot bring peace outside.

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:18.124
But open all the books of
psychology and read them,

00:18:18.273 --> 00:18:21.731
...and go to any psychologist
and see if they are at peace.

00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:29.350
How can they treat us when they themselves
are afflicted by the same things we are?

00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:35.274
But no matter how much I speak,

00:18:35.775 --> 00:18:37.082
...or how much I try to explain,

00:18:40.587 --> 00:18:41.587
...take caution,

00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:44.453
...this is the era of Kaliyuga,

00:18:46.004 --> 00:18:50.328
...and in this Kaliyuga, the time
for a great transformation has come.

00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:56.360
And along with that, the whole
world is being arranged because God,

00:18:58.152 --> 00:19:00.518
...who is overseeing everything,
who is the witness of all,

00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:05.010
...is eager to switch you off.

00:19:07.285 --> 00:19:12.744
He is observing, if the play is
fine, it's for us; else calamity.

00:19:14.977 --> 00:19:17.752
You are seeing what kinds of things
are happening in the world today;

00:19:18.433 --> 00:19:21.041
...the kind of things
the world is facing today;

00:19:22.377 --> 00:19:24.936
...there are wars, poverty,

00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:28.723
...diseases, it's unbearable to watch.

00:19:30.157 --> 00:19:32.948
And no human can find a solution for this.

00:19:34.807 --> 00:19:36.516
Some say bring communism,

00:19:36.585 --> 00:19:38.265
...some say bring socialism,

00:19:38.444 --> 00:19:42.568
...some say bring this ideology,
others say bring capitalism;

00:19:45.676 --> 00:19:47.218
But for any of these to succeed---

00:19:47.818 --> 00:19:51.043
Without attaining that ultimate bliss,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.885
Without gaining the
power to play those

00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:58.355
strings, You can never
truly experience joy,

00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:00.497
And you cannot be satisfied.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.791
Satisfaction is found
only at the feet of God,

00:20:05.729 --> 00:20:08.125
But when I speak of God,
The modern names come up,

00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:10.546
Haha, "Mataji, please continue" (Unclear)

00:20:13.102 --> 00:20:17.107
Everything is fine as long
as I talk about science,

00:20:17.442 --> 00:20:20.250
But as soon as I mention God, it's okay,

00:20:21.653 --> 00:20:24.028
People have so much ego,

00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:28.235
They have become so arrogant,
who do they think they are?

00:20:30.203 --> 00:20:32.474
The God who created us

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:35.141
And who created the entire universe,

00:20:35.264 --> 00:20:36.660
We are challenging Him,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.785
Who are we to do that?
We could be uprooted and thrown away.

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.400
We see unrighteousness in the name of God,

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:50.354
Talking about sex in the name of God,
If you do that,

00:20:52.679 --> 00:20:54.653
Then you are considered
a great religious person;

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.481
Even Kaliyuga (the
dark age) has its limits,

00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:06.374
We are truly drowning
in the sins of this era.

00:21:06.874 --> 00:21:09.115
If you can wash away sins with science,

00:21:09.464 --> 00:21:13.776
If you can create love with
science, then I concede to science.

00:21:17.717 --> 00:21:20.684
But if our speech remains just a speech,

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:22.688
And you experience nothing, and until

00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:27.040
you achieve nothing
even while I'm here,

00:21:27.064 --> 00:21:30.130
then my coming here
and speaking is in vain.

00:21:33.158 --> 00:21:34.933
Such is the power of Kaliyuga,

00:21:36.095 --> 00:21:39.686
Such darkness and arrogance
have overshadowed us,

00:21:39.974 --> 00:21:42.299
That we don't consider
anyone else but ourselves.

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.764
The entire creation
is not even equal to a

00:21:48.788 --> 00:21:51.213
speck of dust on His
feet, that supreme God.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.569
I don't want to convince you of my words,

00:21:57.541 --> 00:22:00.841
But one day, I will make you witness it.

00:22:03.905 --> 00:22:05.585
First, I'm just preparing you.

00:22:06.808 --> 00:22:08.800
Today's young boys

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.787
And the society, that’s coming up today,

00:22:15.241 --> 00:22:19.964
No matter how much you tell
them, their brain will not be receptive,

00:22:21.297 --> 00:22:22.489
The reason is

00:22:24.853 --> 00:22:27.994
That in the name of religion, great
unrighteousness is being established.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.025
No one talked about Kundalini,

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.848
Who talked about Kundalini in those days?

00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:43.559
The poor ones didn't say
anything, and they were still crucified.

00:22:51.686 --> 00:22:53.745
Kundalini is present within you,

00:22:54.739 --> 00:22:56.631
And it can be awakened.

00:22:57.425 --> 00:22:59.970
If you want to see it, come,

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:03.473
And if you don't want to see or know it,

00:23:04.074 --> 00:23:09.013
Then you will have to bear
the sufferings of ignorance.

00:23:11.357 --> 00:23:14.181
But you must at least think one thing,
what after all,

00:23:14.888 --> 00:23:19.046
are we doing, where are we running around
, what are we gaining?

00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:23.726
Within yourself,

00:23:25.305 --> 00:23:29.099
All the deities are seated
within your own body.

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:32.155
Now people say,

00:23:33.655 --> 00:23:36.480
How can Mataji say that
there are deities within us?

00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:41.309
I will give you proof of that right now.

00:23:45.447 --> 00:23:52.086
One person complains of stomach pain, they
come to us and say, "Mother! I've had pain

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.410
In my stomach for many days," another
comes and says, "We can't have children";

00:23:55.494 --> 00:23:57.552
I said, "Okay, look at me."

00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:00.019
Looking at them, we see
that the Kundalini is settled in

00:24:00.043 --> 00:24:02.417
the Swadhisthana Chakr. A
small child will tell you that,

00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:07.019
there is heat
coming from this finger.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.581
All the people sitting here,

00:24:10.808 --> 00:24:14.849
You all will see, with her
eyes closed she could tell

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.541
 that there is heat coming
 from this finger, this thumb.

00:24:21.253 --> 00:24:22.933
What more science can there be?

00:24:23.254 --> 00:24:27.424
Everyone says the same thing,
that they feel heat in this part.

00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:29.584
I am not telling you this,

00:24:31.462 --> 00:24:33.503
When asked what
illness they have, they say,

00:24:33.615 --> 00:24:35.748
"I have pain in the lower abdomen,"

00:24:35.934 --> 00:24:38.687
Someone says, "I have trouble urinating,"

00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:40.622
And someone else says,
"I cannot have children."

00:24:41.306 --> 00:24:44.380
All these diseases related
to the autonomic plexus,

00:24:45.064 --> 00:24:48.362
Which are driven by the Swadhisthan

00:24:48.562 --> 00:24:51.470
And you can feel it right there,

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:55.866
Now what more proof can I give you that

00:24:57.033 --> 00:24:59.058
Even a two-year-old child
will point to this thumb,

00:24:59.142 --> 00:25:03.177
And everyone will point to this
thumb and say, "Mother, here!"

00:25:04.811 --> 00:25:09.318
And then when I tell that person, "Okay,
take the name of Brahmadev and Saraswati;"

00:25:09.767 --> 00:25:14.375
As soon as they take it, they immediately
 say, "Mother! My pain is gone."

00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:21.976
Now, do you need more proof than this?

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:26.279
Brahmadev and Saraswati
are sitting right there in person.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.154
If they weren't there, how
would this work be done?

00:25:30.273 --> 00:25:32.648
And if you take anyone else's
name, nothing will happen.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.474
What more proof do I need to give you all?

00:25:40.233 --> 00:25:42.508
Whether you call it rational or irrational,

00:25:43.107 --> 00:25:45.233
Those who see this
and still don't believe it

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:53.112
Those who have a problem
in their Muladhara chakra,

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:58.229
They feel heat there.

00:26:00.192 --> 00:26:03.500
If there is a strong obstruction
there, an obstruction as it's called,

00:26:04.737 --> 00:26:08.543
Or if someone in that society is
possessed by a spirit, where he sits,

00:26:09.093 --> 00:26:11.993
Then they feel a strong heat,
even to the point of getting blisters.

00:26:14.596 --> 00:26:18.054
Many people who are moving around,
 call themselves God and so on,

00:26:18.918 --> 00:26:21.311
Forget them, even
their disciples experience

00:26:21.335 --> 00:26:23.560
it, and blisters
appear on their hands.

00:26:24.308 --> 00:26:25.988
Their hands get burned,

00:26:26.798 --> 00:26:29.698
Their fingers get burned, all of
their fingers get burned together.

00:26:30.282 --> 00:26:32.890
My granddaughter, who is
two years old, is born realized.

00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.337
She runs away from everyone.

00:26:40.749 --> 00:26:43.861
Everyone feels burning in just one finger.

00:26:45.714 --> 00:26:48.198
If everyone feels
burning in just one finger,

00:26:48.222 --> 00:26:50.705
then there's a catch
in their Agnya chakra.

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:55.106
And on the Agnya chakra where the cross is,

00:26:55.406 --> 00:26:57.281
Jesus Christ sacrificed himself on it.

00:26:57.365 --> 00:27:00.991
And Jesus Christ is there,
whether you are a Christian or not,

00:27:02.797 --> 00:27:04.488
His presence is evident.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.232
Those who call self Hindus and
those who call self Christians

00:27:11.646 --> 00:27:13.971
Everyone thinks of ways to create enmity,

00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:16.263
But no one thinks of ways to love.

00:27:16.963 --> 00:27:22.037
Everyone has here inside place for Jesus
Christ, and right there is Lord Ganesha

00:27:22.877 --> 00:27:25.235
Who is the personification of Omkar.

00:27:26.058 --> 00:27:30.638
The recognition is that Lord Ganesha
had no father, and neither did Jesus.

00:27:32.284 --> 00:27:34.275
But if there's a lunatic person,

00:27:35.192 --> 00:27:38.239
Or someone possessed by a
spirit, or someone mentally deficient,

00:27:38.264 --> 00:27:40.264
And if they come in front of us,

00:27:41.562 --> 00:27:46.317
Then, when we are helping them, or freeing
 their Agnya chakra, if we tell them

00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:54.976
To take the name of Jesus Christ,
the Agnya chakra will immediately open.

00:27:56.833 --> 00:28:01.371
How do we know this? That’s not
a question because we just know.

00:28:07.146 --> 00:28:09.090
And even with this happening,

00:28:10.631 --> 00:28:13.171
If you still don't believe

00:28:15.378 --> 00:28:18.054
That each chakra has a specific deity,

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.538
Which the Adi Shakti has
established from the beginning,

00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:23.183
Long before you even existed,

00:28:24.445 --> 00:28:26.425
And those who are
fighting among themselves,

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:29.647
They should also know

00:28:29.817 --> 00:28:32.608
That the Gurus they are
fighting for are one and the same.

00:28:33.215 --> 00:28:35.856
Like we say about Muhammad
Sahib and Guru Nanak,

00:28:36.748 --> 00:28:39.590
Muhammad Sahib and Guru
Nanak were the same person,

00:28:39.727 --> 00:28:43.130
This is something we can
show from Guru Nanak's life itself!

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:44.957
Once, when Guru Nanak
was lying down, people

00:28:44.981 --> 00:28:46.700
said, "Why are your
feet towards Mecca?

00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:51.788
The Kaaba is in that direction, how
can you lie with your feet towards it?"

00:28:53.572 --> 00:28:56.439
He said, "Okay, I'll turn my feet the
other way," and the Kaaba moved.

00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:02.441
What is the Kaaba but the
dust of Muhammad Sahib's

00:29:02.465 --> 00:29:04.386
feet, and it is the same
for Guru Nanak Sahib.

00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:06.607
Because they are the
same person, and we show

00:29:06.631 --> 00:29:08.702
you this recognition
through the Kundalini.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.442
When someone gets cancer,

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.059
Either Guru Nanak Sahib can cure it, or
Muhammad Sahib can, no one else.

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:18.580
In our Void,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.238
In this place that we call Void,

00:29:21.338 --> 00:29:22.546
Which doctors call Chance,

00:29:23.488 --> 00:29:25.179
Which we call the Bhavasagara,

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:30.160
The one who get us cross the
Bhavasagara is the Adi Guru Dattatreya,

00:29:30.161 --> 00:29:31.502
All these are their incarnations.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.879
Without taking the name of any one of them,

00:29:35.082 --> 00:29:38.207
The ailments of void in
you that lead to cancer,

00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:42.773
The sign of cancer is that here,
the Kundalini strikes rapidly;

00:29:44.817 --> 00:29:45.817
You cannot be cured.

00:29:47.362 --> 00:29:51.203
I want to ask, how many Muslims
 and how many Sikhs are here?

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:56.570
Muhammad Sahib forbade one thing,
which was drinking alcohol.

00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:02.955
He said not to touch it and said nothing
else, for that he was even murdered.

00:30:03.045 --> 00:30:04.887
We know, in what condition he was put to .

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.512
And today, I want to ask Muslims,
they will surely drink alcohol.

00:30:09.783 --> 00:30:12.891
And if a little is left in the
mosque, they start fighting.

00:30:13.537 --> 00:30:15.028
And they surely drink alcohol.

00:30:15.346 --> 00:30:18.346
And not just that, they even write
poetry about alcohol, making it divine.

00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:29.085
When our Guru showed us the path of truth,

00:30:30.303 --> 00:30:35.094
They constantly strive to break that path
and engage in hatred for themselves.

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:39.001
They are thinking of spreading
hatred throughout the world.

00:30:41.124 --> 00:30:43.124
So, what can be done?

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:49.451
And in that, the ego...

00:30:52.297 --> 00:30:56.855
It is so deeply hidden, so
subtly hidden within us, this ego.

00:30:58.807 --> 00:31:01.668
This ego was given to
you specifically, "Aham

00:31:01.692 --> 00:31:04.488
Karoti," to make you
act. What is my role?

00:31:04.867 --> 00:31:07.272
To attain it, to carry out its work?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.775
I was given the power;

00:31:12.787 --> 00:31:14.587
What is a brush meant to do?

00:31:15.567 --> 00:31:20.275
It is meant to completely support the
hands of an artist, to surrender itself.

00:31:22.013 --> 00:31:25.905
But instead of surrendering,
this ego has infiltrated it.

00:31:26.446 --> 00:31:27.769
The entry is made.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.790
We have seen its form too,

00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:35.563
Sometimes the Arabs are puffed
up, sometimes these people,

00:31:35.694 --> 00:31:38.969
Sometimes they are puffed up;
everyone's days are about to change.

00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:42.084
You should know

00:31:42.392 --> 00:31:45.167
That if any harm comes
to any country in any way,

00:31:46.334 --> 00:31:49.476
Not just the country, but the
entire world will be destroyed.

00:31:50.469 --> 00:31:52.149
The same goes for every person.

00:31:52.692 --> 00:31:54.819
If there is no harm within us,

00:31:55.189 --> 00:31:58.059
The force that created
this entire universe,

00:31:58.142 --> 00:32:02.751
The subtle thread that
flows through all of us,

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:04.947
Will be shocked.

00:32:09.377 --> 00:32:12.639
And what scientific proof do you want?

00:32:13.748 --> 00:32:16.756
There is no scientific proof
that is enough for the blind.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.061
For them, the strange
thing is that a woman folk,

00:32:22.307 --> 00:32:26.152
And that too a housewife, how
does she know all these things?

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:32.552
Who was Sita, who was
Radha, and who was Marry?

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:36.076
Were they some great
scholars from somewhere?

00:32:44.368 --> 00:32:48.008
For  you to know ,

00:32:49.368 --> 00:32:51.048
Let a little love flourish within you.

00:32:51.313 --> 00:32:53.047
We will settle your Kundalini.

00:32:53.248 --> 00:32:55.039
because it is the embodiment of love,

00:32:56.891 --> 00:32:59.119
It loves you immensely,

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:02.819
and when a person loves someone immensely,

00:33:03.107 --> 00:33:06.681
What do they want that this love
must enwrap the whole world.

00:33:07.352 --> 00:33:10.114
Because the supreme joy of giving love

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:15.314
wants that it must be embraced by you,
and by them, and by everyone.

00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:19.145
Everything we do for this supreme joy

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:22.339
is only for the glow of this love.

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:30.178
You have been adorned for
this light of love, as I said.

00:33:30.767 --> 00:33:34.688
Your lamp will be lit, but kept hidden.

00:33:36.572 --> 00:33:38.729
You have been chosen for a great work,

00:33:40.428 --> 00:33:44.581
You are the chosen ones, selected from
thousands, chosen from thousands.

00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:48.899
Later, do not say that
Mother did not tell this or that;

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:53.535
We are ready to tell everything
and will explain it in your ears.

00:33:57.674 --> 00:34:00.731
And there is protection
for you in every way.

00:34:01.073 --> 00:34:04.639
You don't need to run away to the forests
from the world, there is no need.

00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:07.601
You don't need to do any abnormal work.

00:34:08.068 --> 00:34:12.059
Within you, living in your
household, within your children,

00:34:13.378 --> 00:34:14.898
this beautiful work will happen.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720
And...

00:34:18.129 --> 00:34:21.220
Spring has arrived, and
you are unaware of it,

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.844
The flowers décor is must to be,

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:28.790
you who are sitting in front.

00:34:29.493 --> 00:34:31.559
I should hope that somehow, in front of me,

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:37.737
I wish to let that fragrance
flow into your hearts.

00:34:38.204 --> 00:34:41.012
And then you will look at each
other and say, yes, yes, yes,

00:34:42.212 --> 00:34:44.088
What a  beauty, what fragrance.

00:34:45.175 --> 00:34:49.616
Of all the beautiful creations in this
world, it is man who is the most beautiful.

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:52.383
Nothing is as beautiful as man.

00:34:54.379 --> 00:34:56.486
Such a beautiful thing has been created,

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.858
It is indeed very divine.

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:04.994
And this love that knows in these
vibrations, this love that understands,

00:35:05.078 --> 00:35:07.885
that recognizes and embraces this joy,

00:35:09.085 --> 00:35:11.043
There is only one thing, and that is man.

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:20.021
In such a beautiful
human heart, I only wish

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:24.760
that there may be a
vision of that joy and then,

00:35:26.651 --> 00:35:28.331
he will receive that joy in abundance.

00:35:32.225 --> 00:35:34.858
Some of you are sitting
with your hands towards me,

00:35:41.169 --> 00:35:44.203
And in the hands of some
of you, there is a coolness,

00:35:44.635 --> 00:35:45.955
like...

00:35:49.289 --> 00:35:50.947
it comes from an air conditioner,

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.120
a cool breeze is coming.

00:35:56.771 --> 00:35:58.351
Put your hands on your head and see,

00:35:58.515 --> 00:35:59.889
towards your love,

00:36:01.376 --> 00:36:02.451
in your mind,

00:36:02.684 --> 00:36:04.658
and you will see that
no thoughts are coming;

00:36:04.682 --> 00:36:06.476
thoughts will stop.
But you are aware,

00:36:06.924 --> 00:36:07.924
fully aware.

00:36:08.995 --> 00:36:10.537
You will see that your...
