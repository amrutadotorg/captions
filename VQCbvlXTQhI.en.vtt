00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.273
Now, we are starting a New Year,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:16.136
and I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:36.183
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:54.589
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:01:06.434
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am sure you are doing meditation, introspection

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:14.156
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals, I should say.

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:29.260
In this New Year, I’ll think there is greater chance

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.197
for you to do much better,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:43.704
because all those years of ordeals are over.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.573
We are now entering into the New Era. I say now the Satya Yuga is established.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.614
In the beginning you may not feel the atmosphere

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:16.755
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:23.909
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all clearing out

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.895
and all the people who are dangerous for your spiritual life,

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:42.543
for your national life, for your family life, will have to take back their way;

00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:46.301
they cannot be successful here.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:01.270
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:05.722
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:12.442
There should be many more waiting for you this year,

00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:19.442
and maybe this year, if you all decide to work it out, I am sure

00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:27.808
you can get lots of people who will be saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:35.934
This is going to be your vow on the New Year day,

00:03:36.137 --> 00:03:43.286
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga in a new way,

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:47.659
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.763
For that, first thing is needed is your Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:04:03.083
This collectivity has to be extremely well built-in, well made,

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:08.815
well understood and absolutely loveable.

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:16.395
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga, because practically all your jealousies,

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:26.127
all your baser ideas have been completely washed out by your Kundalini.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:33.067
She has transformed you, you are different people; you are very, very different.

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:41.855
Not only that, but you have now understood yourselves.

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:47.895
You are knowing your Self. And all those who know their self

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:51.584
cannot fight with each other.

00:04:52.745 --> 00:05:00.745
Because this Self is the reflection of one person,

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:08.980
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can you fight?

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:16.745
When He is within your heart, how can you fight with each other?

00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:20.723
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting with yourself.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:25.317
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:33.776
So all the fights and all the funny things that you have been thinking about

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:39.862
will of course disappear, no doubt. But you’ll become very dynamic.

00:05:40.063 --> 00:05:44.300
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you have to rise;

00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:50.370
just you have to expect your Self to manifest.

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:57.169
You can become very, very collective, progressive

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.799
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.661
You have been given Realization; you have been given the knowledge of Realization;

00:06:10.862 --> 00:06:18.606
whatever was possible has been done for your health and prosperity,

00:06:18.807 --> 00:06:28.198
but now it’s your duty to repay to the Divine by your creative methods.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.784
You have to be very creative.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:40.051
You'll find so many people in this world are full of lots of problems,

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:46.683
which you have got out of it. But you can help them.

00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:51.682
You don’t need any help because you are yourself full of power –

00:06:51.883 --> 00:06:58.810
power of Divinity within you. This Divine power should be used.

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:04.724
It’s not given just to be rusted. This power has to be used.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.975
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming powerful?

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:14.007
Supposing we have electrical power here, and it doesn’t even give light,

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:17.827
so what’s the use of having electrical power?

00:07:18.028 --> 00:07:23.920
So the power that you have is for the emancipation of human beings.

00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:34.124
It is for you to raise the Kundalini of people – you can do it.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:37.311
One person can do it for thousands!

00:07:37.512 --> 00:07:43.812
And I hope now you take up this responsibility upon yourself.

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:49.868
This would be the greatest blessing for you, for Sahaja Yoga

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:57.821
and for the whole world. Because in My vision, we have to change the whole world.

00:07:58.022 --> 00:08:01.766
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can achieve it or not.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:05.554
But if you people really join hands with Me,

00:08:05.755 --> 00:08:11.368
with full effort, it will work out.

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:20.860
Firstly I hear many people don’t go to meditation, into collective meditation.

00:08:21.061 --> 00:08:28.790
They do not join together. It’s surprising after so many years of work I’ve done –

00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:34.548
thirty years I’ve been working, and there are some, some people

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:41.507
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t understand your responsibility.

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:45.985
You have to meditate collectively.

00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:51.108
Whenever there is collective meditation you must join that.

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:59.522
You can also start something in your areas, a collective meditation.

00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:05.772
And it will work out. Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:09.608
are now meditating, I can make them out.

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:14.007
I know who are the ones who are meditating and who are not.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:17.868
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then you come out

00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:23.423
with other problems like my mother’s, father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:29.610
There’s no need to worry about that. Even if you are a realized soul,

00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:36.827
and when you are connected with the Divine, even your own wish will be fulfilled.

00:09:37.028 --> 00:09:45.110
But it does not. Why? Because you still do not understand what you have become.

00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:51.655
You first try giving Realizations to others. See what joy you feel.

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:57.126
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get in anything else.

00:09:57.327 --> 00:10:02.014
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may have,

00:10:02.215 --> 00:10:06.594
you cannot get this joy of giving Realization.

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:12.266
And you will be so very happy; not because you expect anything,

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:19.071
you want anything, nothing of the kind – but only thing is pure joy –

00:10:19.272 --> 00:10:26.843
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis. This is what you are there.

00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:36.048
This is what the Divine wants you to do. Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:41.110
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure my sister… ”

00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:45.641
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then somebody says,

00:10:45.842 --> 00:10:52.391
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife says that… so the husband says this...

00:10:52.592 --> 00:10:55.812
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

00:10:56.013 --> 00:10:59.758
You are now above everything, above all these things.

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:05.188
And you have become absolutely powerful, believe Me.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:10.796
If you haven’t used your power, then how will you know what powers you have got?

00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:15.673
It’s as simple as that. Those who have used it

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:20.790
go on telling Me what miracles they had, what things have happened to them,

00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:26.858
how they were protected, whatever they wanted – how they got it.

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:33.954
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

00:11:34.155 --> 00:11:37.343
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows you are a hypocritical.

00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:42.735
It is for your good, for your growth you have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:47.110
It’s not for somebody else that you are doing it, but for yourself.

00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:54.587
When people are that powerful I am amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

00:11:54.788 --> 00:11:59.640
But they must meditate, and they must join collective meditation.

00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:04.319
Most of the people don’t join collective meditation. I am surprised.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.708
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is no sufficient space,

00:12:09.909 --> 00:12:14.756
so people have to come twice, either Saturday or Sunday;

00:12:14.957 --> 00:12:18.158
some of them have to wait outside – doesn’t matter.

00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:22.522
But going for the collective meditation,

00:12:22.723 --> 00:12:28.920
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing there. Vibrations are flowing there.

00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:36.489
I am there. It’s not that you are just going there just as a ritual.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:44.684
Problem is you people don’t realize that you have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:51.897
responsible for giving Realizations to others and attend

00:12:52.098 --> 00:12:59.247
all the programs you have of meditation.

00:12:59.448 --> 00:13:03.788
With collective meditation you get all right.

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:10.362
All your problems are solved if you go to the collective meditation regularly –

00:13:10.563 --> 00:13:16.999
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t go; you will write letters to Me,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.333
you want to meet Me. This is not going to help.

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:27.577
You may come and trouble Me like that, or do something like that, but doesn’t help.

00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:37.520
What helps that you help yourself. Next year is going to be a great year for you.

00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:44.582
In the West now I was surprised how things are spreading fast.

00:13:44.864 --> 00:13:54.208
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

00:13:54.409 --> 00:14:01.552
Once they get Realization, they understand the value of Realization.

00:14:01.753 --> 00:14:07.334
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t want anything.

00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:12.881
They’ve never desired for anything. Though they have gone through horrible

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:20.130
problems of communism, and now this reaction to that.

00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:29.217
Despite that, all these five countries which I call as ‘real’

00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:36.504
Divine countries, because the way they have accepted it.

00:14:37.114 --> 00:14:40.856
They are poor according to the modern standards,

00:14:41.057 --> 00:14:45.832
but from their heart they are very, very rich.

00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:52.348
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga, they are very, very rich.

00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:58.880
And their scientists are so well qualified. In every type of thing now,

00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:06.334
there is one scientist who has come to India and who has discovered a method

00:15:06.535 --> 00:15:11.678
by which you can see all the chakras, and the Kundalini

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:17.764
and the obstructions and everything – something he can show you.

00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:25.780
While our scientists are busy opposing Me. Little knowledge is very dangerous.

00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:29.708
They don’t want to see what I am doing and how I am doing it.

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:36.006
They just want to criticize Me – all so-called intellectuals.

00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:38.380
Especially in Maharashtra,

00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:42.842
the intellectuals – I think they are something has gone wrong with their heads.

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:48.663
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just beyond them.

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:55.061
What has happened to them I don’t know, but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:55.262 --> 00:16:00.663
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with their rituals.

00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:04.669
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up, take their baths, do this,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.788
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:14.427
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes to Me,

00:16:14.628 --> 00:16:17.989
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do any rituals,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.224
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:25.975
As if doing by that you mean you are a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:26.176 --> 00:16:30.506
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing can happen to you.

00:16:30.707 --> 00:16:34.600
But you have been just under wrong impression.

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:40.031
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go to wrong places

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:47.375
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never helped anyone.

00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:53.984
So first you have to empty yourself. If you are already filled with these ideas,

00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:59.521
these age old ideas, and you are still carrying on with them,

00:16:59.722 --> 00:17:01.906
how can the Divine be filled?

00:17:02.107 --> 00:17:08.375
If there’s a pot already full of water or anything – you cannot fill it.

00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:16.326
So you have to empty it completely. Empty yourself, empty your mind.

00:17:16.527 --> 00:17:24.914
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

00:17:25.115 --> 00:17:30.500
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst thing,

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:36.523
because reaction comes through your Agnya, as I told you the other day,

00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:45.318
and it is due to your conditioning or due to your ego.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:50.375
So some people react because of their conditioning,

00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:59.703
and some people react because of their ego. So why should you react to anything?

00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:04.609
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting. You just watch.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:11.843
See how beautifully they have made beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

00:18:12.044 --> 00:18:16.304
What is the need – some will find some faults, somebody will say

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.443
this should not have been there, how did they manage this,

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:27.046
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy of its creation is there.

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:32.632
And you should be able to see it, feel it, enjoy it.

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:37.911
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise you are not.

00:18:38.112 --> 00:18:44.006
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:48.514
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:54.802
I think there are so many various styles of Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:02.117
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little plus, somebody’s like that.

00:19:02.318 --> 00:19:08.029
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:13.914
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous and happy.

00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:19.117
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting angry with others,

00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:24.169
all these things are going on, and he thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:31.960
In our Divine University we have no degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

00:19:32.162 --> 00:19:35.085
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got your Realization.

00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:41.052
If the Kundalini has burst opened here – it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:41.253 --> 00:19:47.785
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:54.583
It only depends when you are joyous and you are anxious

00:19:54.784 --> 00:20:00.412
to give Realizations to others. You want to share your Realization,

00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:07.083
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself. If that is not your condition,

00:20:07.284 --> 00:20:11.269
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.495
You should find out how many people you have given Realization.

00:20:15.696 --> 00:20:21.724
It’s very important. Because next year, as I’ve said, is a very important,

00:20:21.925 --> 00:20:27.254
very, very important year.

00:20:27.455 --> 00:20:37.748
In that year I would like to see all of you going round and giving Realization.

00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:44.945
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus who are getting exposed one by one.

00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:53.857
If you see their attitude, anywhere you meet them – once I was travelling

00:20:54.058 --> 00:20:58.292
by plane and there was a lady sitting next to Me, she was so hot.

00:20:58.493 --> 00:21:02.669
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?” So she told Me the name.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.449
She said “He’s very good, this guru is the best” … this and that.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.013
Such heat coming from her body! I never said anything,

00:21:12.214 --> 00:21:18.857
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly talking about her guru

00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:26.865
who is such a bad man – and without knowing Me, I was just a stranger to her.

00:21:27.066 --> 00:21:31.058
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:37.292
You should talk to your neighbors, you should talk in your circle.

00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:46.716
Like, we have in India so many customs when we meet people:

00:21:46.917 --> 00:21:50.902
Like in India we do haldi kumkum in Maharashtra.

00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:55.903
They will never talk to those women who come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:56.104 --> 00:21:59.800
They won’t even have My photograph.

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:03.183
If they want, they can do it. But they are -

00:22:03.384 --> 00:22:08.059
I don’t know what are they frightened about. It’s a very good chance.

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:14.341
You have any dinner, you have any public meeting, anything.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:18.644
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga. It’s very surprising.

00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:20.784
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:25.239
that, “We have got this through Sahaja Yoga.”

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.966
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:36.380
One has to understand you all should find out how much responsible you have been

00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:41.552
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course, you are all protected,

00:22:41.753 --> 00:22:51.309
you are all blessed, everyone has got whatever they wanted. Most of them.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:57.855
But how many of them are returning this debt?

00:22:58.056 --> 00:23:03.559
How many are working to give Realization to others?

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:13.216
This is a debt on you. But if your attention is haphazard,

00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:22.081
if your attention is not clear, is not nirmal,

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:32.536
then you are involved into all kinds of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

00:23:32.737 --> 00:23:35.269
You become like an octopus,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:40.333
you go on getting attached to this, attached to that, attached to that.

00:23:40.534 --> 00:23:48.784
You have to be a free bird. All these attachments that you have

00:23:50.104 --> 00:23:57.474
are going to take you nowhere. You should be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

00:23:57.675 --> 00:24:03.222
and should be conscious that you have known yourself.

00:24:03.423 --> 00:24:10.169
If you can just understand your value, your level,

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.534
I can tell you – we can change the whole world!

00:24:15.735 --> 00:24:19.306
We have such a good heritage in this country;

00:24:19.498 --> 00:24:23.214
we have such good culture in this country.

00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:29.393
I have seen the problems of America and other places, we don’t have these problems.

00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:34.571
At least they’re not so prevalent.

00:24:34.772 --> 00:24:39.689
But only the thing that we have to do

00:24:40.344 --> 00:24:44.284
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:44.485 --> 00:24:50.065
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows it’s a tree.

00:24:50.266 --> 00:24:56.276
It knows it has to produce roots, it has not come up ‘like that’.

00:24:56.477 --> 00:25:03.089
It has not been brought up just like a stick, no.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:10.565
It has to do something. In this world everything has to do something.

00:25:10.766 --> 00:25:15.259
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such a rare thing to happen

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.768
that you have got your Realization. So where should we waste our attention?

00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:28.034
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why? We have to grow, we are a different people.

00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:34.095
We are a different race altogether in this world. We are realized souls.

00:25:34.296 --> 00:25:40.635
There were hardly any number during the time of Christ, practically nil.

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:46.915
And even before that I was surprised that in China and other places,

00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:54.899
in one age there used to be one guru – one master. While you are so many masters,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.845
but you don’t want to use your power as a master.

00:26:00.046 --> 00:26:04.870
Why not the women use it also? I find women are more lethargic

00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:09.711
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should show – I am a woman Myself,

00:26:09.912 --> 00:26:14.126
single-handed I’ve done all this work; and why shouldn’t you do it?

00:26:14.327 --> 00:26:20.339
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform people all over the world.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:26.979
But it’s very easy for you – if I can do it, why can’t you do it?

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:35.706
But put your complete attention to it that: ‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:35.907 --> 00:26:39.987
not for ourselves, but for the betterment of humanity.’

00:26:40.188 --> 00:26:45.064
We need it, we need it very much.

00:26:45.265 --> 00:26:51.557
Your compassion, your love, is all being wasted

00:26:51.758 --> 00:26:57.626
if you just think about yourself, your family – what’s the use?

00:26:58.108 --> 00:27:01.706
People do that even before Realization.

00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:08.423
So what is the use of completely getting attached to your families,

00:27:08.624 --> 00:27:14.478
attached to all other things? You should get attached to the whole world!

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:20.259
You belong to the whole world now, you are no more individualistic.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.800
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop has become the ocean.

00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:34.276
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is the lowest, if you have seen,

00:27:34.477 --> 00:27:40.376
lowest so much that the zero point starts from the ocean.

00:27:40.577 --> 00:27:46.776
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point – it lives,

00:27:46.977 --> 00:27:50.626
but all the rivers flow into it.

00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:57.870
And the ocean does the work of throwing clouds in the sky.

00:27:58.071 --> 00:28:06.118
And these then burst and become rain falling to the same ocean.

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:12.483
They come back to the same ocean. So those who are humble

00:28:12.684 --> 00:28:16.313
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:16.514 --> 00:28:21.329
Those who are kind will attract much more Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:26.680
So it is important to see that you change your temperament.

00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:32.671
If you try to show off, nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:28:34.702 --> 00:28:41.766
If you think you are something very great, nobody is going to look at you.

00:28:41.967 --> 00:28:51.711
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very joyous person.

00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:56.343
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group and telling them,

00:28:56.544 --> 00:29:03.257
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying and this thing is happening,

00:29:03.458 --> 00:29:11.243
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

00:29:11.444 --> 00:29:15.485
You go and cry and weep and sit down there!”

00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:23.532
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no sickness can come, no trouble can come.

00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:28.991
It is a fact. Try to understand.

00:29:29.192 --> 00:29:35.993
With you only these people who are supposed to be there, they will rise.

00:29:36.194 --> 00:29:42.304
But no use having identification with people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:45.866
They may be your relations, they may be anything. No use,

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:49.663
because you are at a different level, they are at a different level.

00:29:49.864 --> 00:29:55.180
Either try to raise their level, or have nothing to do with them,

00:29:55.381 --> 00:30:00.836
because they will pull you down. They will not see your height,

00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:07.171
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear to hear,

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:13.836
and they have no feelings of any kind. If they have seen how you are changed,

00:30:14.037 --> 00:30:21.570
how your life is changed, they would have gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:21.771 --> 00:30:27.415
But if they are not, that’s not your job. You shouldn’t bother about them.

00:30:27.616 --> 00:30:31.985
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good, otherwise they are no your relations.

00:30:32.186 --> 00:30:36.834
In no way they are related to you. How will you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:41.015
How will you explain anything to them? It’s going to be impossible

00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:44.053
to talk to these people.

00:30:46.084 --> 00:30:50.946
So what I have to tell you today is that our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:51.147 --> 00:30:58.055
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and it’s doing very well.

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:02.929
But what we have to see – that you do belong to that ocean,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:07.274
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:07.475 --> 00:31:13.553
But it is for you to increase the size of this.

00:31:13.764 --> 00:31:19.532
You have to increase, you have to talk about it, and you have to change people.

00:31:19.733 --> 00:31:28.836
This is your responsibility. You were not given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

00:31:29.037 --> 00:31:35.227
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis, better Sahaja Yogis;

00:31:35.428 --> 00:31:40.413
and you yourself meditate, not only meditate

00:31:40.614 --> 00:31:46.493
but also attend all the collective programs as far as possible.

00:31:46.694 --> 00:31:51.975
I am happy the way you have stayed on and have come here.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:32:00.961
It has rained – still you are here and you still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

00:32:01.162 --> 00:32:07.038
I again and again bless you from my heart, and I want you to have

00:32:07.239 --> 00:32:12.352
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

00:32:12.553 --> 00:32:20.594
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is the pure desire,

00:32:20.795 --> 00:32:26.946
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but to create more Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:27.147 --> 00:32:33.045
That is actually your pure desire. You may not have recognized it,

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:39.055
but unless and until you fulfill that desire,

00:32:39.256 --> 00:32:43.842
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi. It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:32:44.043 --> 00:32:51.733
in every venue, in everywhere, in every one – that you can do it.

00:32:51.934 --> 00:32:57.243
And it will spread very well, and so many people can be saved.

00:32:57.444 --> 00:33:03.602
So many people who are just lost in the maya of stupidity

00:33:03.803 --> 00:33:06.702
will be back on the right path.

00:33:06.903 --> 00:33:11.477
How much good you are going to do for them you just think.

00:33:11.678 --> 00:33:15.959
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja Yogis,

00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:23.430
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:27.321
The whole problem – whenever I see newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

00:33:27.522 --> 00:33:31.477
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there would have been no problem’.

00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:37.475
But I find that still people are roaming about, and going round and round,

00:33:37.676 --> 00:33:43.280
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or they’ve no understanding

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:49.560
that ‘where is this world going?’ and ‘Who’s going to save this world?’

00:33:50.344 --> 00:33:56.569
I am not here to tell you what you should do in your private life.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.887
But you yourself should know to keep yourself cleansed

00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:04.606
and beautiful, what you have to do to yourself.

00:34:04.807 --> 00:34:09.264
Some people are so superficial that it doesn’t go into their heads.

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:12.858
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their heads – very, very superficial.

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:18.170
So forget them. I don’t think they can be saved. So forget them,

00:34:18.371 --> 00:34:22.743
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about some nonsensical things always.

00:34:22.944 --> 00:34:27.928
So with such people you need not – but there are still so many people,

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:35.328
at least I think 80% people, who are seeking and you should give them help.

00:34:35.529 --> 00:34:38.939
This is one thing, is the desire of your Mother

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.886
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga upon yourself

00:34:43.087 --> 00:34:46.970
and go on telling about this to everyone who comes.

00:34:47.171 --> 00:34:56.131
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.

00:34:56.765 --> 00:35:00.001
Now I am going to speak in Marathi.

00:35:00.202 --> 00:35:04.745
At our place, especially the women,

00:35:04.946 --> 00:35:08.317
they know all the festivals by heart.

00:35:08.748 --> 00:35:12.741
Everything is going on properly as per the festival,

00:35:12.942 --> 00:35:16.428
by getting up at 4 AM in the morning, have bath,

00:35:16.629 --> 00:35:19.636
filling up the old style copper water heater, then sitting down.

00:35:19.836 --> 00:35:22.214
Sitting for what? For Puja.

00:35:22.415 --> 00:35:26.683
And we, the people of Maharashtra are very ritualistic.

00:35:26.884 --> 00:35:29.476
In Delhi, it is better.

00:35:29.677 --> 00:35:32.183
There people are not so ritualistic.

00:35:32.384 --> 00:35:34.746
Hence lakhs of people have taken realization.

00:35:34.947 --> 00:35:38.024
But in Maharashtra it is not possible.

00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:43.404
They have to go to Pandharpur taking all sorts of trouble.

00:35:44.012 --> 00:35:48.953
And once you go to Pandhari then you cannot achieve Self Realization there.

00:35:49.638 --> 00:35:51.510
Actually one should get Realization.

00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:56.199
But, all those who go to Pandhari do not achieve Self Realization.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.039
On the contrary, they keep arguing against.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:04.663
Otherwise they proceed holding a big pot of basil on their head.

00:36:05.143 --> 00:36:07.736
Where are they going? To Alandi.

00:36:07.937 --> 00:36:11.016
What for? And who told you?

00:36:15.279 --> 00:36:18.246
Did Dnyaneshwara tell you?

00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:21.904
He did not have footwear on his feet,

00:36:22.105 --> 00:36:25.095
and these people take out his procession in a palanquin.

00:36:25.295 --> 00:36:27.397
They carry out the procession in a palanquin

00:36:27.596 --> 00:36:29.801
and eat food in every village.

00:36:30.002 --> 00:36:33.134
Means there is no self respect.

00:36:33.334 --> 00:36:36.389
In the name of Dnyaneshwar they go to every village

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.160
and keep on consuming food.

00:36:39.685 --> 00:36:43.230
And the villagers think that they achieved punyas by this.

00:36:43.431 --> 00:36:45.783
But these people are beggars.

00:36:45.984 --> 00:36:47.681
They are beggars.

00:36:47.882 --> 00:36:50.588
They move around asking for alms on Dnyanadeva’s name.

00:36:50.789 --> 00:36:53.394
Why do you want to fill bellies of such people?

00:36:53.595 --> 00:36:58.071
What benefit are you going to get by feeding such beggars?

00:36:59.596 --> 00:37:03.877
In our Maharashtra, many such ill practices are continuing

00:37:04.078 --> 00:37:05.546
and there is no end to it.

00:37:05.747 --> 00:37:09.738
If you go on the road, you see them somewhere or the other.

00:37:09.939 --> 00:37:12.198
So all this should stop.

00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:16.177
You tell yourself and tell the others, "What nonsense is this?".

00:37:16.378 --> 00:37:20.789
Why do you do these things? In which scripture are they written?

00:37:21.242 --> 00:37:24.057
Did Dnyandeva write these things?

00:37:24.258 --> 00:37:27.427
Why do you do this? All these things should go away.

00:37:27.628 --> 00:37:29.693
Doing haldi kumkum function

00:37:29.894 --> 00:37:34.358
do you ever mention about Sahaja Yoga in that function?

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:38.228
Once the ladies gather, they give oti offerings, do this, do that.

00:37:38.429 --> 00:37:40.944
Now if anyone gets prosperity, they give Oti offerings to Me.

00:37:41.145 --> 00:37:43.840
I said, „Do not give Me Oti”.

00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:46.522
They said they will visit the Devi temple and offer the Oti.

00:37:46.723 --> 00:37:48.357
„Not to Me. I do not want”.

00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:52.464
If you wish to do something, do Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:56.036
Just offering Oti, what will happen due to this?

00:37:56.237 --> 00:37:58.675
I have no benefit from this neither you have.

00:37:58.881 --> 00:38:00.294
I am telling very clearly.

00:38:00.495 --> 00:38:03.500
If you wish to make the Oti offering, do it in the Devi temple.

00:38:03.701 --> 00:38:06.216
But now you should stop all this.

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.520
Enough now!

00:38:09.179 --> 00:38:13.424
Now enter into yourself. There is so much wealth inside, aquire it.

00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:17.611
There have been so many great sadhus and saints here.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:20.805
What did they teach?

00:38:21.006 --> 00:38:23.047
Have they taught this to us?

00:38:23.248 --> 00:38:27.523
First of all stop all the rituals.

00:38:27.724 --> 00:38:31.785
If they do not do this, they will keep on making lamp wicks.

00:38:31.986 --> 00:38:35.103
Stop all the ritualism.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.534
And above all, they don't have special knowledge about these things.

00:38:42.025 --> 00:38:45.954
They just keep on doing whatever has been said by their forefathers.

00:38:46.155 --> 00:38:50.226
To do this women also drag the men in with them.

00:38:51.844 --> 00:38:54.423
Ladies have more wisdom

00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:57.113
and they nurture the society.

00:38:57.314 --> 00:39:00.025
But if she is possessed by this type of bhoot,

00:39:00.226 --> 00:39:03.953
then she believes whatever the Brahmin says about her issues - that’s it.

00:39:04.154 --> 00:39:06.560
But due to this the children also become useless.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:09.048
They waste their time by doing nothing.

00:39:09.249 --> 00:39:12.722
So don’t attend the haldi kumkum ceremony.

00:39:13.015 --> 00:39:18.011
Only if the lady who invites for haldi kumkum speaks about Sahaj Yoga too

00:39:18.212 --> 00:39:20.352
then only you should attend, otherwise don’t.

00:39:20.553 --> 00:39:22.164
You should be firm on this.

00:39:22.365 --> 00:39:25.035
Is it only that I want Sahaja Yoga or you also want it?

00:39:25.236 --> 00:39:27.701
And don’t others want it too?

00:39:27.864 --> 00:39:30.241
Why don’t you also tell them about Sahaja Yoga?

00:39:30.442 --> 00:39:32.832
You will not tell there,

00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:38.242
that we are Sahaja Yogis and what we all have achieved.

00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:40.505
Same thing with men also.

00:39:40.706 --> 00:39:43.584
They seem to be under the influence of ladies.

00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:47.338
In our Maharashtra there are two types of people.

00:39:47.539 --> 00:39:49.900
Either they are very ritualistic

00:39:50.076 --> 00:39:52.628
or they are "intelligent” -

00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:55.699
means stupid but so-called intelligent.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.503
And due to "intelligence" they do not understand what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:39:59.703 --> 00:40:02.763
Because they have such sharp intellect they do not understand,

00:40:02.964 --> 00:40:05.154
they feel that it is some other falsification.

00:40:05.355 --> 00:40:08.684
My dear fellow, just do it and understand it.

00:40:08.885 --> 00:40:14.202
That is why you will be surprised Maharashtra’s progress is very less.

00:40:14.403 --> 00:40:17.113
And I have made tremendous effort in Maharashtra.

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:20.524
I have worked hard by visiting so many villages. I have toiled.

00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:22.914
Even after working so hard year after year,

00:40:23.115 --> 00:40:25.794
Maharashtra has not reached that state.

00:40:25.995 --> 00:40:29.250
What is this? What is the reason for this?

00:40:29.765 --> 00:40:34.214
I feel that ritualism should be discarded. Right away.

00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:38.806
Nothing doing. It is not at all needed.

00:40:39.007 --> 00:40:44.432
Secondly, the men should not use their intellect too much.

00:40:44.633 --> 00:40:47.385
But where is the intellect?

00:40:48.439 --> 00:40:52.072
What is the use of such intellect

00:40:52.273 --> 00:40:55.913
that takes you on the wrong path?

00:40:56.114 --> 00:41:02.367
The intellectuals in Maharashtra are worse than the ritualists.

00:41:03.067 --> 00:41:06.328
Means these people are confused and have lost their way.

00:41:06.543 --> 00:41:09.498
It is difficult for them to give up because everyone has ego.

00:41:09.699 --> 00:41:11.312
They think they are very special.

00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:15.009
They think there cannot be any incarnation in today's world.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.824
Because they are as such

00:41:17.025 --> 00:41:20.930
why would there be an incarnation between these donkey people?

00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:24.222
They have such ideas about themselves.

00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:26.954
So called intellectuals of here,

00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:31.747
have done foolish deeds which have no end.

00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:35.420
They don’t want to understand, they don't want to listen.

00:41:35.635 --> 00:41:38.982
Because of this type of mentality how would anything go inside them?

00:41:39.183 --> 00:41:42.185
Hence the wave of over intelligence that has come in Maharashtra

00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:44.141
is more dangerous.

00:41:44.342 --> 00:41:46.164
They write books after books.

00:41:46.364 --> 00:41:48.332
Whatever they write it is really a lot.

00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:51.434
And then people say, “I have read in the book”.

00:41:51.635 --> 00:41:53.883
Whatever is written in the books, is it truth?

00:41:54.084 --> 00:41:57.355
Who are these people to write? What experience do they have?

00:41:57.556 --> 00:41:59.569
You people should tell them straight away

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.853
that you do not agree with these useless things.

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:05.375
They keep on criticising everyone.

00:42:05.582 --> 00:42:09.050
They criticise Shri Krishna, criticise Shri Rama.

00:42:09.251 --> 00:42:13.526
If not that, they criticise all these sadhus and saints.

00:42:13.727 --> 00:42:16.009
And they say that all this is blind faith.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.332
You don’t have faith, then how will you have blind faith?

00:42:19.532 --> 00:42:23.944
The one who has faith in himself only will go deep in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:25.254 --> 00:42:29.481
Why would a person without faith in himself join Sahaja Yoga?

00:42:29.682 --> 00:42:32.781
Hence, find out such people.

00:42:33.214 --> 00:42:36.713
Such absolutely good people exist in our country.

00:42:36.914 --> 00:42:40.191
You should help them.

00:42:40.392 --> 00:42:45.173
I think, in Maharashtra there is a need to do a lot of work.

00:42:45.432 --> 00:42:47.239
We are experts in fighting.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.387
That is why in politics we are always having fights, fights and fights.

00:42:51.588 --> 00:42:55.668
But in Sahaja Yoga, how many people are there

00:42:55.869 --> 00:43:02.630
who have dedicated themselves to fulfil their aims?

00:43:02.837 --> 00:43:04.863
How many people are there?

00:43:05.064 --> 00:43:08.086
If there is one leader, they will find faults in him.

00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:10.824
„He is like this, Mataji, he is like that”.

00:43:11.025 --> 00:43:14.197
Even if we keep this aside, apart leadership,

00:43:14.398 --> 00:43:17.521
still they will tell a lot of other things to Me, such as:

00:43:17.722 --> 00:43:19.303
"My grandmother is ill”.

00:43:19.504 --> 00:43:22.473
"Oh, dear, she may be old, she may be ill, it is OK.

00:43:22.674 --> 00:43:26.237
Why do you want to go to this side?”. "My grandmother” - means who?

00:43:26.438 --> 00:43:28.402
The entire world is your grandmother,

00:43:28.603 --> 00:43:31.479
the entire world your relation. You are Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.640
"Your grandmother, your father, your mother" - how is it possible?

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:38.788
Are you not on the top of the world?

00:43:38.989 --> 00:43:43.069
Your level has changed, right? You relatives have changed.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:47.090
In olden days, bramhin used to marry a bramhin only.

00:43:47.826 --> 00:43:49.840
Marriage into another caste was a taboo.

00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:53.575
Is it like that now? Everything has got mixed up.

00:43:53.822 --> 00:43:56.499
Then why should Sahaja Yogis think

00:43:56.700 --> 00:44:01.024
that, ”This is my mother and this is your mother”.

00:44:01.225 --> 00:44:03.878
"Mine” and "yours” are gone.

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:06.148
Now the entire world is yours.

00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:09.005
Has Dnyaneshwar said anything like this ever?

00:44:09.206 --> 00:44:11.212
We have had so many sadhus and saints.

00:44:11.412 --> 00:44:13.237
Has Tukaram ever said anything like this?

00:44:13.437 --> 00:44:15.967
Have they ever differentiated like "mine" and "yours"?

00:44:16.167 --> 00:44:19.092
Just to keep on saying the verses written by these saints,

00:44:19.292 --> 00:44:23.893
the meaning does not go inside the brain because of they grind away.

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:26.432
So leaving apart all these things,

00:44:26.633 --> 00:44:31.760
a person should be honest about oneself:

00:44:32.749 --> 00:44:34.742
„What am I doing to myself?

00:44:34.943 --> 00:44:36.749
What have I done for myself?

00:44:36.949 --> 00:44:38.523
What I want to do for myself?”.

00:44:38.723 --> 00:44:40.270
You must see that.

00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:45.311
And after that you will realize and will get enlightened.

00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:47.619
You are a Sahaj Yogi.

00:44:47.802 --> 00:44:50.931
Were there ever so many Sahaja Yogis in the world?

00:44:51.132 --> 00:44:53.837
Two-four were there and they (saints) were tortured by people.

00:44:54.037 --> 00:44:57.026
Still what beautiful poems they have written.

00:44:57.227 --> 00:45:01.196
You belong to such a place, whose name itself is "Maha-rashtra” (great land).

00:45:01.418 --> 00:45:05.915
How can you become small frogs after coming here?

00:45:07.424 --> 00:45:10.044
Now leave these relatives.

00:45:10.245 --> 00:45:14.927
And your relatives are only those who are realized (“Hechi soyare hoti”)

00:45:15.142 --> 00:45:17.195
as said by saint Dnyaneshwar.

00:45:17.396 --> 00:45:19.627
Only these are your relatives.

00:45:19.828 --> 00:45:24.448
None else is your relative, that is clearly mentioned.

00:45:24.649 --> 00:45:26.869
But one should realize that.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:31.540
People just keep on reading ”Pasaydaan” (song written by saint Dnyaneshwar), read it, learnt by heart.

00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:34.710
Just learn everything by heart, that’s it.

00:45:35.653 --> 00:45:39.335
They learn without retaining anything.

00:45:41.629 --> 00:45:44.639
So, the people from Maharashtra

00:45:44.837 --> 00:45:48.914
should observe themselves with a humouros attitude that,

00:45:49.115 --> 00:45:53.090
”What am I doing? What is my work?”.

00:45:53.291 --> 00:45:55.926
You should come to Delhi and see.

00:45:56.127 --> 00:45:59.034
There are two-three very good Maharshtrians who have arrived there.

00:45:59.235 --> 00:46:03.092
They say, "Mataji, you should invite people from Maharashtra only".

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:05.519
They are very good people”. I said, „Is that right?

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.903
Go there for a few days, then you will know”.

00:46:09.442 --> 00:46:12.038
In Sahaja Yoga to become deep you need an effort first.

00:46:12.239 --> 00:46:16.268
I don’t say you should go to Himalaya and stand on one foot. No.

00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:19.142
But, ”Where am I going? What am I doing?

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:22.322
What am I living for?" That needs to be seen.

00:46:22.523 --> 00:46:25.258
Then only shower of blessings.

00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:31.027
Even for blessings, Sahastrara should be opened, completely.

00:46:31.227 --> 00:46:34.994
You must value yourself, but you don't.

00:46:35.195 --> 00:46:40.180
"Why it happened like this, that I  don’t value myself?"

00:46:40.647 --> 00:46:45.335
We must decide that, "I am able do this, I am able to do that".

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:50.145
And we should have big dreams

00:46:50.346 --> 00:46:53.763
that, "I will go to this place, that village to spread Sahaja Yoga".

00:46:53.954 --> 00:46:55.826
We should see such dreams.

00:46:56.027 --> 00:46:58.927
We should imagine such big things.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:03.536
You see, we, Indians, have accomplished so much work in the past.

00:47:03.737 --> 00:47:06.055
There was a queen of Jhansi. She was a woman.

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:10.101
She said, "No, we will defeat the British people".

00:47:10.302 --> 00:47:13.890
She went to the war field taking her small child with her.

00:47:14.091 --> 00:47:15.744
And she died in the battlefield,

00:47:15.945 --> 00:47:19.371
but British people said, "Though we won over Jhansi,

00:47:19.572 --> 00:47:22.130
the glory is of Lakshmi Bai (the queen of Jhansi)".

00:47:22.331 --> 00:47:25.561
Such type of women were born in Maharashtra.

00:47:25.783 --> 00:47:29.432
And now, nothing of this kind is seen.

00:47:29.633 --> 00:47:32.109
Only decking up.

00:47:34.083 --> 00:47:38.129
Why I am saying this? Because I had bad experiences.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.177
Now all have started saying, "We don’t want Maharashtrian wife".

00:47:42.378 --> 00:47:44.645
These women misbehaved there.

00:47:44.846 --> 00:47:51.268
If I speak in Marathi others won't understand, but you will.

00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:54.083
These women went there and misbehaved

00:47:54.284 --> 00:47:56.733
and now they don’t want wife from Maharashtra.

00:47:56.933 --> 00:47:58.494
They have no education, nothing,

00:47:58.695 --> 00:48:01.182
still we married them thinking that it is our responsibility.

00:48:01.383 --> 00:48:03.882
But they brought ill fame to us only.

00:48:04.083 --> 00:48:07.779
Told you this as I have not complained to you untill today.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.568
I always kept on praising you, but it will not work now.

00:48:11.768 --> 00:48:15.392
Now I should see something concrete in front of Me.

00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:18.649
Hence next time I am going to ask everyone

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:22.000
how many people you have given Realization to.

00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:26.648
In a way you are better than Gujaratis. They are very rigid.

00:48:26.849 --> 00:48:29.053
Sahaja Yoga is not going in their head.

00:48:29.253 --> 00:48:33.139
But even if it enters into your head, it is a waste.

00:48:34.237 --> 00:48:39.085
So, today everyone should make a resolution in their minds

00:48:39.285 --> 00:48:41.290
that, "Mataji, next time when you come here

00:48:41.491 --> 00:48:44.007
we will show you what all can be done in Maharashtra.

00:48:44.208 --> 00:48:46.568
Where have the valiant Marathas (warriors of Maharashtra) gone?

00:48:46.769 --> 00:48:48.863
Don’t know what happened.

00:48:49.064 --> 00:48:51.376
With the help of these warriors so much was accomplished.

00:48:51.577 --> 00:48:56.699
And you people are so educated good people, everything proper

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.646
and you are of no help to Me.

00:49:01.011 --> 00:49:03.510
Hence this number should increase.

00:49:03.711 --> 00:49:07.535
And not only this, you should also progress.

00:49:07.736 --> 00:49:10.941
And I should see that in Maharashtra,

00:49:11.142 --> 00:49:13.738
Sahaja Yoga should reach the peak.

00:49:13.939 --> 00:49:15.960
Reach the summit.

00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:19.174
There is nothing to be said beyond this.

00:49:19.375 --> 00:49:21.336
It should be like this.

00:49:21.537 --> 00:49:24.463
Just make me speechless.

00:49:24.664 --> 00:49:26.432
How happy I will be if this happens.

00:49:26.632 --> 00:49:28.439
I was born here.

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.957
And I studied everything in Marathi language.

00:49:32.158 --> 00:49:36.188
Even today I know Marathi quite well.

00:49:36.389 --> 00:49:40.211
But I cannot understand the minds of the Marathi people.

00:49:40.412 --> 00:49:43.592
I cannot understand the minds of Marathi people.

00:49:43.793 --> 00:49:48.304
Because my father and mother were of a very high caliber,

00:49:48.505 --> 00:49:52.954
due to them, I did not know that such people exist in Maharashtra.

00:49:53.154 --> 00:49:58.169
Similarly you should prove, "Mataji we are special.

00:49:58.479 --> 00:50:01.760
You entrusted us with such great responsibility.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.861
And we will prove it you that Maharashtra is no less".

00:50:07.062 --> 00:50:11.345
You are all great warriors,

00:50:11.546 --> 00:50:13.509
and now is the time to show your bravery.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.493
Just being Marathi means what?

00:50:15.694 --> 00:50:18.954
Just to call oneself Maharashtrian is a waste.

00:50:19.155 --> 00:50:22.844
That is the opinion of people about you.

00:50:23.045 --> 00:50:24.486
It should not be like this.

00:50:24.687 --> 00:50:27.498
Hence understand Sahaja Yoga completely,

00:50:27.699 --> 00:50:33.840
practise it and make Maharashtra proud.

00:50:36.304 --> 00:50:42.633
I say that with infinite blessings to you.

00:50:42.834 --> 00:50:45.526
Please accept it.
