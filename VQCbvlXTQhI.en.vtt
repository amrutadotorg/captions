00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.273
Now, we are starting a New Year,

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:16.136
and I wish you all a very happy and
prosperous New Year.

00:00:23.696 --> 00:00:36.183
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very
deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:54.589
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all
have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:01:06.434
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am
sure you are doing meditation, introspection

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:14.156
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals,
I should say.

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:29.260
In this New Year, I’ll think there is
greater chance

00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.197
for you to do much better,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:43.704
because all those years of ordeals are
over.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.573
We are now entering into the New Era. I say
now the Satya Yuga is established.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.614
In the beginning you may not feel
the atmosphere

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:16.755
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

00:02:16.956 --> 00:02:23.909
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all
clearing out

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.895
and all the people who are dangerous
for your spiritual life,

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:42.543
for your national life, for your family
life, will have to take back their way;

00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:46.301
they cannot be successful here.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:01.270
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far
they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:05.722
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:12.442
There should be many more waiting for you
this year,

00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:19.442
and maybe this year, if you all decide to
work it out, I am sure

00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:27.808
you can get lots of people who will be
saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:35.934
This is going to be your vow on the New
Year day,

00:03:36.137 --> 00:03:43.286
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga
in a new way,

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:47.659
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.763
For that, first thing is needed is your
Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

00:03:55.964 --> 00:04:03.083
This collectivity has to be extremely well
built-in, well made,

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:08.815
well understood and absolutely loveable.

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:16.395
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga,
because practically all your jealousies,

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:26.127
all your baser ideas have been completely
washed out by your Kundalini.

00:04:26.328 --> 00:04:33.067
She has transformed you, you are different
people; you are very, very different.

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:41.855
Not only that, but you have now understood
yourselves.

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:47.895
You are knowing your Self. And all those
who know their self

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:51.584
cannot fight with each other.

00:04:52.745 --> 00:05:00.745
Because this Self is the reflection of one
person,

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:08.980
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can
you fight?

00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:16.745
When He is within your heart, how can you
fight with each other?

00:05:16.946 --> 00:05:20.723
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting
with yourself.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:25.317
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

00:05:25.518 --> 00:05:33.776
So all the fights and all the funny things
that you have been thinking about

00:05:34.276 --> 00:05:39.862
will of course disappear, no doubt. But
you’ll become very dynamic.

00:05:40.063 --> 00:05:44.300
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you
have to rise;

00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:50.370
just you have to expect your Self
to manifest.

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:57.169
You can become very, very collective,
progressive

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.799
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.661
You have been given Realization; you have
been given the knowledge of Realization;

00:06:10.862 --> 00:06:18.606
whatever was possible has been done
for your health and prosperity,

00:06:18.807 --> 00:06:28.198
but now it’s your duty to repay to
the Divine by your creative methods.

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:31.784
You have to be very creative.

00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:40.051
You'll find so many people in this world
are full of lots of problems,

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:46.683
which you have got out of it. But you can
help them.

00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:51.682
You don’t need any help because you are
yourself full of power –

00:06:51.883 --> 00:06:58.810
power of Divinity within you. This Divine
power should be used.

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:04.724
It’s not given just to be rusted. This
power has to be used.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.975
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming
powerful?

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:14.007
Supposing we have electrical power here,
and it doesn’t even give light,

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:17.827
so what’s the use of having electrical
power?

00:07:18.028 --> 00:07:23.920
So the power that you have is for
the emancipation of human beings.

00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:34.124
It is for you to raise the Kundalini
of people – you can do it.

00:07:34.325 --> 00:07:37.311
One person can do it for thousands!

00:07:37.512 --> 00:07:43.812
And I hope now you take up this
responsibility upon yourself.

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:49.868
This would be the greatest blessing for
you, for Sahaja Yoga

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:57.821
and for the whole world. Because in My
vision, we have to change the whole world.

00:07:58.022 --> 00:08:01.766
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can
achieve it or not.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:05.554
But if you people really join hands with Me,

00:08:05.755 --> 00:08:11.368
with full effort, it will work out.

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:20.860
Firstly I hear many people don’t go
to meditation, into collective meditation.

00:08:21.061 --> 00:08:28.790
They do not join together. It’s surprising
after so many years of work I’ve done –

00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:34.548
thirty years I’ve been working, and there
are some, some people

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:41.507
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t
understand your responsibility.

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:45.985
You have to meditate collectively.

00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:51.108
Whenever there is collective meditation
you must join that.

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:59.522
You can also start something in your areas,
a collective meditation.

00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:05.772
And it will work out. Many people who are
in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:09.608
are now meditating, I can make them out.

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:14.007
I know who are the ones who are meditating
and who are not.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:17.868
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then
you come out

00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:23.423
with other problems like my mother’s,
father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:29.610
There’s no need to worry about that. Even
if you are a realized soul,

00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:36.827
and when you are connected with the Divine,
even your own wish will be fulfilled.

00:09:37.028 --> 00:09:45.110
But it does not. Why? Because you still do
not understand what you have become.

00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:51.655
You first try giving Realizations to others.
See what joy you feel.

00:09:51.856 --> 00:09:57.126
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get
in anything else.

00:09:57.327 --> 00:10:02.014
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may
have,

00:10:02.215 --> 00:10:06.594
you cannot get this joy of giving
Realization.

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:12.266
And you will be so very happy; not because
you expect anything,

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:19.071
you want anything, nothing of the kind –
but only thing is pure joy –

00:10:19.272 --> 00:10:26.843
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis.
This is what you are there.

00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:36.048
This is what the Divine wants you to do.
Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:41.110
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure
my sister… ”

00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:45.641
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then
somebody says,

00:10:45.842 --> 00:10:52.391
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife
says that… so the husband says this...

00:10:52.592 --> 00:10:55.812
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

00:10:56.013 --> 00:10:59.758
You are now above everything, above all
these things.

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:05.188
And you have become absolutely powerful,
believe Me.

00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:10.796
If you haven’t used your power, then how
will you know what powers you have got?

00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:15.673
It’s as simple as that. Those who have
used it

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:20.790
go on telling Me what miracles they had,
what things have happened to them,

00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:26.858
how they were protected, whatever they
wanted – how they got it.

00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:33.954
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be
hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

00:11:34.155 --> 00:11:37.343
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows
you are a hypocritical.

00:11:37.544 --> 00:11:42.735
It is for your good, for your growth you
have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:47.110
It’s not for somebody else that you are
doing it, but for yourself.

00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:54.587
When people are that powerful I am
amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

00:11:54.788 --> 00:11:59.640
But they must meditate, and they must join
collective meditation.

00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:04.319
Most of the people don’t join collective
meditation. I am surprised.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:09.708
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is
no sufficient space,

00:12:09.909 --> 00:12:14.756
so people have to come twice, either
Saturday or Sunday;

00:12:14.957 --> 00:12:18.158
some of them have to wait outside –
doesn’t matter.

00:12:19.176 --> 00:12:22.522
But going for the collective meditation,

00:12:22.723 --> 00:12:28.920
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing
there. Vibrations are flowing there.

00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:36.489
I am there. It’s not that you are just
going there just as a ritual.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:44.684
Problem is you people don’t realize that you
have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:44.885 --> 00:12:51.897
responsible for giving Realizations
to others and attend

00:12:52.098 --> 00:12:59.247
all the programs you have of meditation.

00:12:59.448 --> 00:13:03.788
With collective meditation you get
all right.

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:10.362
All your problems are solved if you go to
the collective meditation regularly –

00:13:10.563 --> 00:13:16.999
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t
go; you will write letters to Me,

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.333
you want to meet Me. This is not going
to help.

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:27.577
You may come and trouble Me like that, or
do something like that, but doesn’t help.

00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:37.520
What helps that you help yourself. Next
year is going to be a great year for you.

00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:44.582
In the West now I was surprised how things
are spreading fast.

00:13:44.864 --> 00:13:54.208
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

00:13:54.409 --> 00:14:01.552
Once they get Realization, they understand
the value of Realization.

00:14:01.753 --> 00:14:07.334
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t
want anything.

00:14:07.535 --> 00:14:12.881
They’ve never desired for anything. Though
they have gone through horrible

00:14:13.082 --> 00:14:20.130
problems of communism, and now this
reaction to that.

00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:29.217
Despite that, all these five countries
which I call as ‘real’

00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:36.504
Divine countries, because the way they have
accepted it.

00:14:37.114 --> 00:14:40.856
They are poor according to the modern
standards,

00:14:41.057 --> 00:14:45.832
but from their heart they are very,
very rich.

00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:52.348
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,
they are very, very rich.

00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:58.880
And their scientists are so well qualified.
In every type of thing now,

00:14:59.081 --> 00:15:06.334
there is one scientist who has come
to India and who has discovered a method

00:15:06.535 --> 00:15:11.678
by which you can see all the chakras, and
the Kundalini

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:17.764
and the obstructions and everything –
something he can show you.

00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:25.780
While our scientists are busy opposing Me.
Little knowledge is very dangerous.

00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:29.708
They don’t want to see what I am doing and
how I am doing it.

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:36.006
They just want to criticize Me – all
so-called intellectuals.

00:15:36.207 --> 00:15:38.380
Especially in Maharashtra,

00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:42.842
the intellectuals – I think they are
something has gone wrong with their heads.

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:48.663
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just
beyond them.

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:55.061
What has happened to them I don’t know,
but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:55.262 --> 00:16:00.663
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with
their rituals.

00:16:00.864 --> 00:16:04.669
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up,
take their baths, do this,

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.788
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:14.427
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes
to Me,

00:16:14.628 --> 00:16:17.989
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do
any rituals,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.224
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:25.975
As if doing by that you mean you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:26.176 --> 00:16:30.506
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing
can happen to you.

00:16:30.707 --> 00:16:34.600
But you have been just under wrong
impression.

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:40.031
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go
to wrong places

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:47.375
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never
helped anyone.

00:16:47.576 --> 00:16:53.984
So first you have to empty yourself. If you
are already filled with these ideas,

00:16:54.185 --> 00:16:59.521
these age old ideas, and you are still
carrying on with them,

00:16:59.722 --> 00:17:01.906
how can the Divine be filled?

00:17:02.107 --> 00:17:08.375
If there’s a pot already full of water or
anything – you cannot fill it.

00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:16.326
So you have to empty it completely. Empty
yourself, empty your mind.

00:17:16.527 --> 00:17:24.914
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can
take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

00:17:25.115 --> 00:17:30.500
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst
thing,

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:36.523
because reaction comes through your Agnya,
as I told you the other day,

00:17:36.724 --> 00:17:45.318
and it is due to your conditioning or due
to your ego.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:50.375
So some people react because of their
conditioning,

00:17:50.576 --> 00:17:59.703
and some people react because of their ego.
So why should you react to anything?

00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:04.609
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting.
You just watch.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:11.843
See how beautifully they have made
beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

00:18:12.044 --> 00:18:16.304
What is the need – some will find some
faults, somebody will say

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:19.443
this should not have been there, how did
they manage this,

00:18:19.644 --> 00:18:27.046
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy
of its creation is there.

00:18:27.247 --> 00:18:32.632
And you should be able to see it, feel it,
enjoy it.

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:37.911
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise
you are not.

00:18:38.112 --> 00:18:44.006
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:48.514
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:54.802
I think there are so many various styles
of Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:02.117
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little
plus, somebody’s like that.

00:19:02.318 --> 00:19:08.029
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:13.914
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous
and happy.

00:19:14.115 --> 00:19:19.117
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting
angry with others,

00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:24.169
all these things are going on, and he
thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:31.960
In our Divine University we have no
degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

00:19:32.162 --> 00:19:35.085
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got
your Realization.

00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:41.052
If the Kundalini has burst opened here –
it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:41.253 --> 00:19:47.785
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real
Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:54.583
It only depends when you are joyous and you
are anxious

00:19:54.784 --> 00:20:00.412
to give Realizations to others. You want
to share your Realization,

00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:07.083
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself.
If that is not your condition,

00:20:07.284 --> 00:20:11.269
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.495
You should find out how many people you
have given Realization.

00:20:15.696 --> 00:20:21.724
It’s very important. Because next year, as
I’ve said, is a very important,

00:20:21.925 --> 00:20:27.254
very, very important year.

00:20:27.455 --> 00:20:37.748
In that year I would like to see all of you
going round and giving Realization.

00:20:37.949 --> 00:20:44.945
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus
who are getting exposed one by one.

00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:53.857
If you see their attitude, anywhere you
meet them – once I was travelling

00:20:54.058 --> 00:20:58.292
by plane and there was a lady sitting next
to Me, she was so hot.

00:20:58.493 --> 00:21:02.669
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?”
So she told Me the name.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.449
She said “He’s very good, this guru is
the best” … this and that.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.013
Such heat coming from her body! I never
said anything,

00:21:12.214 --> 00:21:18.857
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly
talking about her guru

00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:26.865
who is such a bad man – and without knowing
Me, I was just a stranger to her.

00:21:27.066 --> 00:21:31.058
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:37.292
You should talk to your neighbors, you
should talk in your circle.

00:21:39.737 --> 00:21:46.716
Like, we have in India so many customs when
we meet people:

00:21:46.917 --> 00:21:50.902
Like in India we do haldi kumkum
in Maharashtra.

00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:55.903
They will never talk to those women who
come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:56.104 --> 00:21:59.800
They won’t even have My photograph.

00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:03.183
If they want, they can do it. But they
are -

00:22:03.384 --> 00:22:08.059
I don’t know what are they frightened
about. It’s a very good chance.

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:14.341
You have any dinner, you have any public
meeting, anything.

00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:18.644
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very surprising.

00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:20.784
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:25.239
that, “We have got this through Sahaja
Yoga.”

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.966
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:36.380
One has to understand you all should find
out how much responsible you have been

00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:41.552
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course,
you are all protected,

00:22:41.753 --> 00:22:51.309
you are all blessed, everyone has got
whatever they wanted. Most of them.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:57.855
But how many of them are returning
this debt?

00:22:58.056 --> 00:23:03.559
How many are working to give Realization
to others?

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:13.216
This is a debt on you. But if your
attention is haphazard,

00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:22.081
if your attention is not clear, is not
nirmal,

00:23:22.282 --> 00:23:32.536
then you are involved into all kinds
of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

00:23:32.737 --> 00:23:35.269
You become like an octopus,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:40.333
you go on getting attached to this,
attached to that, attached to that.

00:23:40.534 --> 00:23:48.784
You have to be a free bird. All these
attachments that you have

00:23:50.104 --> 00:23:57.474
are going to take you nowhere. You should
be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

00:23:57.675 --> 00:24:03.222
and should be conscious that you have known
yourself.

00:24:03.423 --> 00:24:10.169
If you can just understand your value,
your level,

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.534
I can tell you – we can change the whole
world!

00:24:15.735 --> 00:24:19.306
We have such a good heritage in this
country;

00:24:19.498 --> 00:24:23.214
we have such good culture in this country.

00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:29.393
I have seen the problems of America and
other places, we don’t have these problems.

00:24:29.594 --> 00:24:34.571
At least they’re not so prevalent.

00:24:34.772 --> 00:24:39.689
But only the thing that we have to do

00:24:40.344 --> 00:24:44.284
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:44.485 --> 00:24:50.065
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows
it’s a tree.

00:24:50.266 --> 00:24:56.276
It knows it has to produce roots, it has
not come up ‘like that’.

00:24:56.477 --> 00:25:03.089
It has not been brought up just like
a stick, no.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:10.565
It has to do something. In this world
everything has to do something.

00:25:10.766 --> 00:25:15.259
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such
a rare thing to happen

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.768
that you have got your Realization. So
where should we waste our attention?

00:25:20.969 --> 00:25:28.034
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why?
We have to grow, we are a different people.

00:25:28.235 --> 00:25:34.095
We are a different race altogether in this
world. We are realized souls.

00:25:34.296 --> 00:25:40.635
There were hardly any number during
the time of Christ, practically nil.

00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:46.915
And even before that I was surprised that
in China and other places,

00:25:47.116 --> 00:25:54.899
in one age there used to be one guru – one
master. While you are so many masters,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.845
but you don’t want to use your power
as a master.

00:26:00.046 --> 00:26:04.870
Why not the women use it also? I find women
are more lethargic

00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:09.711
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should
show – I am a woman Myself,

00:26:09.912 --> 00:26:14.126
single-handed I’ve done all this work;
and why shouldn’t you do it?

00:26:14.327 --> 00:26:20.339
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform
people all over the world.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:26.979
But it’s very easy for you – if I can
do it, why can’t you do it?

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:35.706
But put your complete attention to it that:
‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:35.907 --> 00:26:39.987
not for ourselves, but for the betterment
of humanity.’

00:26:40.188 --> 00:26:45.064
We need it, we need it very much.

00:26:45.265 --> 00:26:51.557
Your compassion, your love, is all being
wasted

00:26:51.758 --> 00:26:57.626
if you just think about yourself,
your family – what’s the use?

00:26:58.108 --> 00:27:01.706
People do that even before Realization.

00:27:01.907 --> 00:27:08.423
So what is the use of completely getting
attached to your families,

00:27:08.624 --> 00:27:14.478
attached to all other things? You should
get attached to the whole world!

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:20.259
You belong to the whole world now, you are
no more individualistic.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:26.800
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop
has become the ocean.

00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:34.276
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is
the lowest, if you have seen,

00:27:34.477 --> 00:27:40.376
lowest so much that the zero point starts
from the ocean.

00:27:40.577 --> 00:27:46.776
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point –
it lives,

00:27:46.977 --> 00:27:50.626
but all the rivers flow into it.

00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:57.870
And the ocean does the work of throwing
clouds in the sky.

00:27:58.071 --> 00:28:06.118
And these then burst and become rain
falling to the same ocean.

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:12.483
They come back to the same ocean. So those
who are humble

00:28:12.684 --> 00:28:16.313
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:16.514 --> 00:28:21.329
Those who are kind will attract much more
Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:26.680
So it is important to see that you change
your temperament.

00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:32.671
If you try to show off, nobody is going
to be impressed by you.

00:28:34.702 --> 00:28:41.766
If you think you are something very great,
nobody is going to look at you.

00:28:41.967 --> 00:28:51.711
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very
joyous person.

00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:56.343
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group
and telling them,

00:28:56.544 --> 00:29:03.257
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying
and this thing is happening,

00:29:03.458 --> 00:29:11.243
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will
say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

00:29:11.444 --> 00:29:15.485
You go and cry and weep and sit down
there!”

00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:23.532
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no
sickness can come, no trouble can come.

00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:28.991
It is a fact. Try to understand.

00:29:29.192 --> 00:29:35.993
With you only these people who are
supposed to be there, they will rise.

00:29:36.194 --> 00:29:42.304
But no use having identification with
people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:42.505 --> 00:29:45.866
They may be your relations, they may be
anything. No use,

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:49.663
because you are at a different level, they
are at a different level.

00:29:49.864 --> 00:29:55.180
Either try to raise their level, or have
nothing to do with them,

00:29:55.381 --> 00:30:00.836
because they will pull you down. They will
not see your height,

00:30:01.037 --> 00:30:07.171
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear
to hear,

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:13.836
and they have no feelings of any kind.
If they have seen how you are changed,

00:30:14.037 --> 00:30:21.570
how your life is changed, they would have
gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:21.771 --> 00:30:27.415
But if they are not, that’s not your job.
You shouldn’t bother about them.

00:30:27.616 --> 00:30:31.985
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good,
otherwise they are no your relations.

00:30:32.186 --> 00:30:36.834
In no way they are related to you. How will
you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:41.015
How will you explain anything to them?
It’s going to be impossible

00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:44.053
to talk to these people.

00:30:46.084 --> 00:30:50.946
So what I have to tell you today is that
our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:51.147 --> 00:30:58.055
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and
it’s doing very well.

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:02.929
But what we have to see – that you do
belong to that ocean,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:07.274
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:07.475 --> 00:31:13.553
But it is for you to increase the size
of this.

00:31:13.764 --> 00:31:19.532
You have to increase, you have to talk
about it, and you have to change people.

00:31:19.733 --> 00:31:28.836
This is your responsibility. You were not
given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

00:31:29.037 --> 00:31:35.227
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis,
better Sahaja Yogis;

00:31:35.428 --> 00:31:40.413
and you yourself meditate, not only
meditate

00:31:40.614 --> 00:31:46.493
but also attend all the collective programs
as far as possible.

00:31:46.694 --> 00:31:51.975
I am happy the way you have stayed on and
have come here.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:32:00.961
It has rained – still you are here and you
still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

00:32:01.162 --> 00:32:07.038
I again and again bless you from my heart,
and I want you to have

00:32:07.239 --> 00:32:12.352
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

00:32:12.553 --> 00:32:20.594
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is
the pure desire,

00:32:20.795 --> 00:32:26.946
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but
to create more Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:27.147 --> 00:32:33.045
That is actually your pure desire. You may
not have recognized it,

00:32:33.246 --> 00:32:39.055
but unless and until you fulfill that
desire,

00:32:39.256 --> 00:32:43.842
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.
It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:32:44.043 --> 00:32:51.733
in every level, in everywhere, with every
one – that you can do it.

00:32:51.934 --> 00:32:57.243
And it will spread very well, and so many
people can be saved.

00:32:57.444 --> 00:33:03.602
So many people who are just lost
in the maya of stupidity

00:33:03.803 --> 00:33:06.702
will be back on the right path.

00:33:06.903 --> 00:33:11.477
How much good you are going to do for them
you just think.

00:33:11.678 --> 00:33:15.959
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja
Yogis,

00:33:16.162 --> 00:33:23.430
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja
Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:27.321
The whole problem – whenever I see
newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

00:33:27.522 --> 00:33:31.477
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there
would have been no problem’.

00:33:31.678 --> 00:33:37.475
But I find that still people are roaming
about, and going round and round,

00:33:37.676 --> 00:33:43.280
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or
they’ve no understanding

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:49.560
that ‘where is this world going?’ and
‘Who’s going to save this world?’

00:33:50.444 --> 00:33:56.569
I am not here to tell you what you should
do in your private life.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.887
But you yourself should know to keep
yourself cleansed

00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:04.606
and beautiful, what you have to do
to yourself.

00:34:04.807 --> 00:34:09.264
Some people are so superficial that it
doesn’t go into their heads.

00:34:09.465 --> 00:34:12.858
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their
heads – very, very superficial.

00:34:13.059 --> 00:34:18.170
So forget them. I don’t think they can
be saved. So forget them,

00:34:18.371 --> 00:34:22.743
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about
some nonsensical things always.

00:34:22.944 --> 00:34:27.928
So with such people you need not – but
there are still so many people,

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:35.328
at least I think 80% people, who are
seeking and you should give them help.

00:34:35.529 --> 00:34:38.939
This is one thing, is the desire of your
Mother

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.886
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself

00:34:43.087 --> 00:34:46.970
and go on telling about this to everyone
who comes.

00:34:47.171 --> 00:34:56.131
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I
do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.
