00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.714
This is a recording of the advice
given by her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:10.733
on 22nd March 1977,

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.850
at Bhakti Vidya Bhavana,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.537
in the form of questions and answers.

00:00:23.006 --> 00:01:27.120
[Shri Mataji speaks Hindi and Marathi]

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.800
They have mastered the Kundalini completely.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999
There are some, you know that,

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:37.132
but there are some who have got
realization last five years and they don’t know a word.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:41.209
On the contrary, they’ll just come and
ask us, “My mother is ill. So please treat her.”

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.067
“My father is ill.” “You treat me.” “My this thing is ill.”

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:46.535
That’s all. They are good for nothing.

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:50.694
So now you have to also give to others and you have too,

00:01:50.895 --> 00:01:55.652
realize yourself and to be the light of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:55.852 --> 00:01:59.998
It’s a great pleasure. It’s a
greatest joy, to give it to others,

00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:05.784
and you don’t have to spend any money for
that and you don’t have to earn any money for that.

00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:09.455
It is just a free flow. But you must give.

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:13.249
Otherwise, if you do not give then you stagnate;

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:15.961
absolutely, it stagnates.

00:02:16.161 --> 00:02:19.136
Today we have so many people
over here, I’m very happy to see.

00:02:19.336 --> 00:02:23.156
I hope you’ll keep up the
number. At least on a Monday keep it.

00:02:23.357 --> 00:02:56.013
[Shri Mataji speaks Marathi and Hindi].

00:02:56.214 --> 00:03:01.567
Sahaja Yoga is not a thing to be taken that frivolously.

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:05.629
It works. It works in you in no time effortlessly,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.612
but after realization, for all
human beings it is necessary,

00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:15.938
to understand the complete working
of the Kundalini and of the vibrations.

00:03:16.138 --> 00:03:18.247
You must know the complete science.

00:03:18.447 --> 00:03:24.037
Otherwise, what is the use of getting money
which you do not know how to spend or use?

00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:26.382
So best thing is to get to it

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:32.220
and by you will find that even if
you are sick and cured by Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.668
you’ll find you’ll become so much healthier and better.

00:03:35.868 --> 00:03:37.769
You’ll be enriched much more.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.819
If you do not take to Sahaja Yoga, gradually
you’ll find your vibrations will be lost after some time,

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.233
because God doesn’t want to waste His vibrations on people,

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:51.996
who do not want to give it to others.

00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:55.690
There are some people who give explanations,

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.766
“We have a family. How are we to give up?” Now I
have also family. You know I have grandchildren also.

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.302
This is the only good thing
you can do without paying a single pie.

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:09.988
You have got it without paying a single pie and

00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:12.567
you have to distribute also without paying a,

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:15.836
single pie and you have to enjoy yourself.

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:19.733
Only you can enjoy if you can give.

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:25.717
You have to learn all these things.
By God’s grace you have so many people here.

00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:28.643
Here now at least fifty percent people, I would say,

00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:33.227
are such that they can tell you about Kundalini quite well

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.114
and you they are going to work out with you.

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:38.597
They are going to tell you about this; nothing to feel bad,

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:42.204
because once you master the
Kundalini you will become just the same.

00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:45.837
So there is nothing to feel
superior or inferior or anything.

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:49.900
Only thing is that you today you
have jumped into the sea and you have,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.825
learnt how to swim and they have learnt it long time back,

00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:58.056
and gradually you’ll pick up very
fast. Some people pick up so fast,

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:04.723
that it’s sometimes astonishingly speedy,

00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:08.109
and even the people who,

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:12.423
have been with Me for years cannot beat them.

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:18.655
So, it is only your simplicity and
earnestness to be that. You work it out very well.

00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:25.985
Aata, I would like you to ask Me
questions because when I go away I don’t want,

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:29.101
the half-hearted people to ask questions

00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:31.920
because then the, if the questions start, then the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.631
murmuring souls will start and they will try to,

00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:40.720
bring out people who are not yet
half-baked, and then they will fizzle out.

00:05:40.921 --> 00:05:44.207
So, you have to completely mature into Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:47.482
Do not listen to anybody because he says so.

00:05:47.683 --> 00:05:51.053
You ask him, “What is your authority?
Do you know anything about Kundalini?

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:53.829
Have you, how many people you have given realization to?

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.693
How many people you have given jagruti
to? None. Then you keep quiet.” That’s all.

00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:01.176
You have seen Kundalini moving.

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:03.567
You have seen its pulsation.

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:08.747
You have felt the vibrations.
Now, anybody who talks about against,

00:06:08.947 --> 00:06:13.486
Sahaja Yoga is very easy, anybody
can, any Dick, Tom and Harry can say,

00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:16.466
very easy to criticize anything,

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:20.521
very easy because how much does it
take? You don’t need any capital for that.

00:06:20.722 --> 00:06:23.128
You need not be knowing a word about Kundalini.

00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:25.738
Some might say it’s a myth, it’s a psychological

00:06:25.838 --> 00:06:28.143
thing; all kinds of nonsense they will say.

00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:30.605
But if you are a serious people, then you must

00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:33.067
understand that you have felt the vibrations,

00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:36.922
they are there, and that you are going to proceed further.

00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:41.567
It is for your own good and for
your own asking you should get it.

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:47.512
If there are certain problems on your chakras
they must be corrected. So, what is the question now?

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.980
Yogi: What is the ego and
superego and Why God has given this to us?

00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:05.675
Shri Mataji: Ego and superego; these are the
two institutions. They grow within us as we grow,

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:12.274
older and older because when we start growing.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.009
I’ll give you an example how the ego and super-ego grow.

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:20.748
A mother is nursing the child, and the child is in complete...

00:07:24.383 --> 00:07:29.791
The mother is in complete
bliss when the child is being nursed.

00:07:31.648 --> 00:07:34.135
Now, what happens,

00:07:34.335 --> 00:07:39.450
when the mother moves the child to
another side, then the child doesn’t like it.

00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:43.559
So he puts in a reaction. This reaction comes in..

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:48.135
[Don’t look there. They are not minister.

00:07:48.335 --> 00:07:53.783
He wears cap so everyone
thinks he is minister. Your attention

00:07:53.883 --> 00:07:59.255
is not here. He is just a lawyer –Marathi]

00:07:59.455 --> 00:08:02.009
...for your information haan…

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:05.276
[Now remove that cap otherwise everyone will

00:08:05.376 --> 00:08:08.542
again think that some new minister has come,

00:08:08.756 --> 00:08:19.597
Now we should meet them last time my son did not get job.
You will think about it then. Mother is asking a person as why did

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:30.900
you wear that cap now everyone is thinking that you are a
minister. Now people will bring application to you so don’t tell me.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:09:05.956
I will answer his question he has asked about ego & superego. Did you get my point? Now if someone go then all will see that person. How can I get benefit from that? Why human brain is so frivolous. You have something & god

00:09:06.056 --> 00:09:40.616
has given you a big head. You should give respect to it. Do not turn your eyes. Which is the thing which attract
your attention? Attention is very big thing. Attention should be pure. This is a bad habit to turn eyes – Marathi]

00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:44.469
Our eyes are ruined by because of the turning our eyes

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:47.759
all the time here and here. Our Agnya chakra gets spoilt.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.765
You completely lose control over your eyes.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:54.523
Eyes are the most important things.

00:09:56.634 --> 00:10:00.900
They carry the light of your
heart of your Aatma and Spirit.

00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:04.767
At every small spot must you see?

00:10:05.212 --> 00:10:10.192
[If you want to sit then sit
& want to go then go – Marathi]

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.567
This is the problem with us, that
we don’t understand our own values

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.391
and we don’t understand what
should be our priority for what are we here.

00:10:24.592 --> 00:10:27.536
We must have that seriousness about ourselves.

00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:32.659
Anybody comes in or goes in or anything happening,

00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:36.087
your attention should be on to yourself.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:40.370
It’s very necessary at this
time when you are in meditation.

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:44.567
This is the first time we are trying to see ourselves.

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:47.012
So why should anybody interest us?

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:52.181
It is only a very short time when we are –

00:10:53.244 --> 00:10:55.443
so now I’m telling you a very important thing...

00:10:55.644 --> 00:11:06.441
[At that time you come & everybody was looking at
you. It should not happen. Someone will come & someone

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:17.334
will go but you should not look at them. Now subject
is very deep. Why god has given us ego & super-ego.

00:11:17.592 --> 00:11:19.400
It’s a very big question. - Marathi]

00:11:20.616 --> 00:11:25.924
Why God has created this ego and super-ego within us?

00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:36.558
From our stomach the medh,

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:41.594
what you call the fat globules,
you can say medh, in the stomach,

00:11:41.956 --> 00:11:44.527
rises into our brain,

00:11:44.728 --> 00:11:47.900
passing through all these centers,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.696
evolving to be the cells of the brain.

00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:55.900
Did you follow this point?

00:11:56.728 --> 00:12:02.233
Because medh even the brain is made of fat cells,

00:12:03.124 --> 00:12:05.124
what you call the mendu.

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:09.359
So for the medh to become the mendu,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.567
it has to evolve to achieve a certain amount,

00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:20.497
of charges of awareness of human awareness,

00:12:20.878 --> 00:12:23.233
and the brain, human brain,

00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:27.900
is the most precious one because it has a dimension,

00:12:28.258 --> 00:12:34.313
which animals do not have, a mental
dimension, you can say, an emotional dimension.

00:12:34.702 --> 00:12:39.759
Its physical dimension also has another dimension.

00:12:40.359 --> 00:12:44.827
We can say that on every dimension we have four sides.

00:12:45.243 --> 00:12:51.799
Emotionally we understand love. We
understand how to receive, how to reciprocate.

00:12:52.594 --> 00:12:56.733
We understand beauty, we understand poetry,

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.900
we understand sweet gestures.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.736
We can create these things also.

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:13.889
On the mental level our dimension has a fourth dimension,

00:13:14.089 --> 00:13:17.853
I should say, by which we create things.

00:13:18.054 --> 00:13:21.712
Animals cannot create; we can create.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:29.900
On the physical also we have a special advantage,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.372
that we have lifted our heads up,

00:13:34.648 --> 00:13:38.233
our hands act in a different way than our feet,

00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:41.265
we have a better capacity to hold things.

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:46.067
Not only that but we can use this body,

00:13:47.941 --> 00:13:51.690
to lift much higher things that are here;

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.652
for example, we can create a crane and lifted it.

00:13:54.853 --> 00:13:58.007
So, we have also got a power

00:13:58.207 --> 00:14:03.448
by which we can have mastery over the matter.

00:14:03.662 --> 00:14:07.294
This is not among the animals. So we have already,

00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:10.558
a higher dimension which is reached in our brain.

00:14:10.658 --> 00:14:13.567
Now, such a beautiful human brain is created.

00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:20.900
So, at this stage of human
evolution when man has reached this stage,

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:24.080
we should say it is still in a transition.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.720
A little more he has to jump, and he
becomes that for which he has created.

00:14:29.353 --> 00:14:34.295
So, in this transition it is
necessary to protect that brain

00:14:34.495 --> 00:14:37.904
very carefully – one purpose;

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:42.109
secondly, to make this brain independent,

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.101
of the will of God and to make it use by itself,

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:51.500
so it develops another dimension of wisdom.

00:14:55.268 --> 00:14:58.637
By faltering, by making mistakes,

00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:04.233
by correcting, by falling, by going into extremes,

00:15:04.433 --> 00:15:09.338
man starts coming in the center
and understands that this is the position.

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:12.193
Now see in our country the political news,

00:15:12.393 --> 00:15:17.863
how from the British we came to
– British had to give us up, then we –

00:15:18.064 --> 00:15:22.131
now the new this thing we started that didn’t fail;

00:15:22.331 --> 00:15:24.703
that failed. So, we started another style.

00:15:24.903 --> 00:15:30.136
So, we started another style like that. You see, you
go on changing from this to another, experimenting,

00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:35.796
and you reach a position where you see this
is the position by which you really progress.

00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:39.169
All this is done by a human brain.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.490
So, a human brain is the most coveted thing,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.233
most evolved thing,

00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:49.733
and with the brain heart also,

00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:54.303
human heart also, has to be co-related to the brain,

00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:58.058
and so the both the things evolve very well.

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:00.779
Our stomachs are evolved very well.

00:16:00.979 --> 00:16:03.919
Actually, our stomachs are much more,

00:16:04.119 --> 00:16:07.646
subtle and they cannot take gross things.

00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:10.611
They require very fine and

00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:14.233
sophisticated things for digestion,

00:16:15.013 --> 00:16:19.497
and so many things as you know
that we are different from animals.

00:16:20.676 --> 00:16:27.469
Now at this stage to protect this brain
also you need a kind of a hard covering.

00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:33.778
So, God has created this system by
which you just get completely covered up,

00:16:34.175 --> 00:16:36.733
by creating an ego and super-ego

00:16:36.933 --> 00:16:42.413
which is just a sort of, you can
say, a by-product of your activities.

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:48.733
Any activity a human-being does, has a reaction.

00:16:49.111 --> 00:16:54.993
For example, if he tries to say “no” to
something it has a reaction: he creates his ego.

00:16:55.193 --> 00:16:58.584
If he accepts something he creates his super-ego.

00:16:59.012 --> 00:17:03.357
This is also done because it is done,

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:08.076
with the help that the brain of the man is made triangular

00:17:08.276 --> 00:17:10.495
and prismatic in nature, prismatic.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:14.620
It’s prism-like plane, and in the prism of the brain

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:20.112
when the rays of God’s divine power flows in,

00:17:20.386 --> 00:17:24.067
it goes into refraction, into different angles,

00:17:24.267 --> 00:17:28.287
and by the principle of parallelogram of forces,

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:31.370
part of it escapes outside, this side and this side.

00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:35.604
That’s why a man can think of the future and of the past,

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:39.323
but the animal does not think of these things.

00:17:39.524 --> 00:17:44.140
So that’s how our brain is a specially made one.

00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:49.450
It is protected by creating a
ego and a super-ego completely

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.793
by which our taalu, where the fontanel bone is covered,

00:17:53.993 --> 00:17:56.736
you are separated from the All-pervading Power,

00:17:56.836 --> 00:17:59.739
by which you get your independence and freedom,

00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:04.567
to act as you like, to use
your brain as you like, to learn,

00:18:04.894 --> 00:18:08.143
because the evolution if it has to go any further

00:18:08.343 --> 00:18:12.013
this is the transition period when you have to try.

00:18:14.244 --> 00:18:18.618
We can say like this for a simile
because simile should not be drawn too far.

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:21.670
But supposing this instrument I prepare.

00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:27.342
After preparing it, I first
try it on a small cell separately

00:18:27.645 --> 00:18:30.188
and then I put to the mains.

00:18:30.471 --> 00:18:33.577
In the same way, first it is tried separately,

00:18:33.777 --> 00:18:36.934
individually with an articulation.

00:18:37.537 --> 00:18:40.993
The other day I gave a simile of a, of an egg,

00:18:41.193 --> 00:18:45.965
which might have sounded little
funny to Marathi people, I don’t know why,

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:48.247
that an egg is created

00:18:48.447 --> 00:18:52.347
by articulating it completely, it’s protected.

00:18:52.656 --> 00:18:58.842
Till it reaches a complete
stage of its re-birth, is dwijah.

00:18:59.043 --> 00:19:03.692
Then only, you see, the mother bird pierces,

00:19:04.632 --> 00:19:06.900
the egg and the,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.997
there is a re-birth of the little chick.

00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:18.733
In the same way, you are made
protected so that you are made ready.

00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.567
Ultimately,

00:19:20.767 --> 00:19:26.394
you reach a stage where you are just
ready to jump into another state, and it happens.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.455
In the incubator also, if you put these eggs,

00:19:30.656 --> 00:19:35.567
with the warmth, you see they
feel the warmth – warmth is the love –

00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:40.135
and with that they grow

00:19:40.438 --> 00:19:43.219
and at a point all of them hatch out,

00:19:43.493 --> 00:19:45.759
I mean not simultaneously,

00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:51.140
but we can say little difference, but most of
them hatch out within two three days’ time.

00:19:51.341 --> 00:19:54.874
It is in the same manner
today’s Sahaja Yoga is working out,

00:19:55.212 --> 00:19:57.506
that you are just ready to have it.

00:19:57.707 --> 00:20:01.480
You’ve had a very great past, you’ve been seeking,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.447
you have been going round, you have
no ideas to what you have been doing.

00:20:05.648 --> 00:20:09.627
And today you are wearing
ordinary dresses like ordinary people

00:20:09.827 --> 00:20:13.469
and today you are here for a lecture with Me

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:16.160
and at this time this happens.

00:20:17.343 --> 00:20:21.400
This is the greatest miracle for some people,

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:26.754
but for Me it is just a
happening. It has to happen at this time.

00:20:26.954 --> 00:20:31.900
For us if we see lots of flowers
turning into fruits, we never call it a miracle

00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:37.026
because we have taken it for granted. So
many miracles of life we have taken it for granted,

00:20:37.227 --> 00:20:42.815
but it has to happen to human-beings,
and when it happens it happens like that. -

00:20:43.204 --> 00:20:45.620
Naturally for you, you see,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.275
it’s My child’s play. It is for Me, it is My child’s play

00:20:49.476 --> 00:20:54.400
because that is My job is to give you
moksha. I am mokshadayani; no doubt about it.

00:20:54.698 --> 00:20:59.785
If that is My nature, if that
is My nature then I will do it.

00:21:00.442 --> 00:21:03.755
If the nature of the sun is to give you,

00:21:04.243 --> 00:21:07.080
the rays of the sun, it will give.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.400
It is not difficult because that is the nature.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.974
You see, if it is your nature as a human
being to see things and colors you will see.

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:18.567
What is so great about it?

00:21:18.997 --> 00:21:21.067
What is to be proud about it?

00:21:21.267 --> 00:21:25.545
I mean, I don’t understand; if you are that, you are that.

00:21:26.736 --> 00:21:30.567
What is there to be higher or
lower? I can’t just understand.

00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:35.900
This is all because of a human
ego that a man has evaluations.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.733
He thinks this is higher; that is lower.

00:21:38.934 --> 00:21:41.127
In a way human beings are higher than men

00:21:41.327 --> 00:21:45.377
and human beings are much higher than gods

00:21:45.578 --> 00:21:48.105
and much higher than God Almighty sometimes,

00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:51.696
because He has to beg of you to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:58.170
because unless and until you
are absolutely freely accepting

00:21:58.371 --> 00:22:00.336
Sahaja Yoga it doesn’t work out.

00:22:00.537 --> 00:22:02.509
You have to be absolutely free.

00:22:02.709 --> 00:22:06.466
I cannot entice you. I cannot
hypnotize you. I cannot do anything.

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:08.391
It has to be there.

00:22:08.663 --> 00:22:11.233
And that’s why if it works just like that,

00:22:11.433 --> 00:22:14.176
why should you feel that there is something wrong in it?

00:22:14.377 --> 00:22:17.563
It has worked with so many
people. So many people have felt it.

00:22:17.763 --> 00:22:20.600
You will also feel it. It is
your due. So, you are feeling it,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.067
and supposing there is something wrong with the seed

00:22:23.267 --> 00:22:27.426
or something wrong with the
flower, then we will correct it also.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.009
May take two days more; doesn’t matter.

00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:34.767
It is not something extraordinary for Me.

00:22:34.968 --> 00:22:39.067
Yes, it is in a way, because in
all My previous lives I have not done it.

00:22:39.267 --> 00:22:41.339
So, I feel very happy.

00:22:42.045 --> 00:22:47.233
For example, when you are a leaf
you can’t do the things of a flower,

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.930
when you are a root you are not doing that at all,

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.733
but when you are a flower

00:22:53.933 --> 00:22:56.505
then a bee can come and do it.

00:22:56.918 --> 00:23:01.233
What is so much surprising about it?

00:23:01.433 --> 00:23:04.659
Because it has been promised. Many a time it has been said.

00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:09.567
Even Vivekananda has said that,
“Mother will come and She will do the job.”

00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:14.323
He has also said that,
“Buddha is just a part, a little drop.”

00:23:14.524 --> 00:23:18.400
He has said all these things. When
you quote Vivekananda, read him properly.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.469
He also says, ‘I can’t do
anything. It’s Mother is going to do.

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:24.125
Everybody is putting on that Mother.”

00:23:24.351 --> 00:23:26.939
Shankaracharya said, “Mother will come.”

00:23:27.264 --> 00:23:31.723
In the Bible if you read John’s Revelation, written that,

00:23:31.923 --> 00:23:35.071
“A Woman will come, and She will be giving,

00:23:35.272 --> 00:23:40.067
re-birth and She’ll be afraid of giving
re-birth. She’ll be protecting Her child.”

00:23:40.267 --> 00:23:42.236
All these things are there,

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:44.810
and now when the Mother comes in you say,

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:49.107
“Why are you there, Mother?” Now who the
Mother must come with a horn or what should She do?

00:23:49.606 --> 00:23:53.320
But if I’m the Mother Who has
to do the job, I have to do the job.

00:23:54.718 --> 00:23:58.213
Now you start finding faults with
Me. So, what to do with you people?

00:23:58.413 --> 00:24:00.942
I mean, after all, what should I have?

00:24:01.143 --> 00:24:03.733
Whatever I thought proper, I have.

00:24:04.124 --> 00:24:06.527
What else do you want Me to have?

00:24:06.728 --> 00:24:10.400
See if the, if Ganesha has a trunk of a,

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.733
elephant it has a meaning,

00:24:13.235 --> 00:24:16.248
and if somebody has something else it has a meaning.

00:24:16.449 --> 00:24:19.770
We say that Surabhi the cow,

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.715
the first cow which appeared in the Brindavana –

00:24:22.915 --> 00:24:27.895
in the, in the Vaikuntha stage she
appeared? all the Gods were inside her.

00:24:28.095 --> 00:24:33.553
We accept a cow but we can’t accept a
human being who has got these powers.

00:24:34.672 --> 00:24:37.652
It’s all right. Don’t accept.
I’m saying not that you should,

00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:41.621
flatly accept Me because once I say
that there are many Mataji’s all over now.

00:24:41.822 --> 00:24:44.700
What I’m saying, you should feel the vibrations yourself.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.014
You should take them. If you feel them,

00:24:48.214 --> 00:24:51.328
if you see the Kundalini rising, that is the first sign.

00:24:51.528 --> 00:24:54.896
If you see the Kundalini rising, you should.

00:24:55.277 --> 00:25:00.067
When I went to Ambernath there was one Janardhan Maharaj.

00:25:00.267 --> 00:25:02.598
He had come, you see, because he had heard about Me.

00:25:02.798 --> 00:25:05.353
He came just to take My pareeksha, whatever it is.

00:25:05.554 --> 00:25:08.400
So he was sitting near the stage,

00:25:08.964 --> 00:25:10.833
and people told Me that,

00:25:11.033 --> 00:25:15.167
“He may not accept You, Mataji.” I said,
“Let Me see. If he is a realized soul he may,”

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.429
and when I went inside on the
stage he just fell flat on My feet.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.953
Then he told Me, “I saw everybody’s Kundalini
rising as soon as You stepped inside, I could see.”

00:25:24.153 --> 00:25:26.220
They can see also.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.805
He saw everybody’s Kundalini rising as soon as I
came in. They would not rise but the Kundalini rose.

00:25:32.005 --> 00:25:33.476
“We wish You welcome.”

00:25:33.676 --> 00:25:36.528
So, if they know, many people
know. Gagangarh Maharaj knows.

00:25:36.728 --> 00:25:39.400
He’s told many people. I have not met him.

00:25:39.834 --> 00:25:42.160
He has told many people about Me.

00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:45.961
I never met him before. Then I went to see him,

00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:49.233
and he talked to Me as if he
would talk to an incarnation, he would.

00:25:49.433 --> 00:25:56.067
He never talked to Me as if he would talk to
Mrs. C.P. Srivastava. He didn’t know. He asked Me

00:25:56.267 --> 00:26:28.408
[This world has so many bad people. How can you do it? Do they trouble you? How do you incarnate suddenly? We saw Shri chakra opening so we realized that Shri Mataji is born. Akar ,ukar & makar
has also come before Shri chakra. We saw Shri Ganesh, Dattatreya, coming here before you came here. He said it so clearly. It is recorded. He said that Shri Mataji has given you so much –Marathi],

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.400
“Why has She given you?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.233
What have you done?

00:26:32.663 --> 00:26:35.810
How many of you are going to give your life for Her?

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.647
She has given you this precious thing.

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.938
You cannot part with one farthing.

00:26:42.138 --> 00:26:46.006
What are you going to do for Her?” He scolded all of them.

00:26:46.403 --> 00:26:48.900
He said all these things; it is on the tape.

00:26:49.361 --> 00:26:53.460
There’s another person Mr. –
his name is Mr. Pralahad Brahamachaari.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.409
He’s from Calicut.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.795
He went to America. He told
people about Me. They know about Me.

00:26:59.995 --> 00:27:02.622
He told that, “She has come now. There’s nothing to worry.”

00:27:02.823 --> 00:27:06.180
But for you people, you see, you people,

00:27:06.381 --> 00:27:11.104
are so egoistical that you cannot
bear to hear such a thing about anyone.

00:27:11.304 --> 00:27:14.994
That is the trouble: you are too egoistical.

00:27:15.863 --> 00:27:18.859
Adhajal gagri chalkat jaaye.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.733
Empty vessel makes too much sounds.

00:27:21.933 --> 00:27:24.148
It’s a sign of emptiness.

00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:28.215
You see, they, those people are telling me even that

00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:31.567
[aside: what was his name from Ambernath]

00:27:31.974 --> 00:27:36.831
Naagnath Baba, he said, “Mataji, they can never accept.

00:27:37.143 --> 00:27:42.529
They never accepted any incarnation and they
are not going to accept You, try Your level best.”

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:45.400
And Maharaj says, “For twelve years You try.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.567
If they are all right, then I’ll come down.” Otherwise they
are all hiding themselves. They are afraid of human beings.

00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:52.567
Really, it is true.

00:27:53.148 --> 00:27:57.946
There are so many like that. Three
very old people came to see Me in Haridwar.

00:27:58.146 --> 00:27:59.799
They said the same thing.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.519
Now are you going to behave yourself

00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:06.067
or are you going to behave in a manner

00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:10.423
that is going to be detrimental
to your progress in spiritual life?

00:28:10.624 --> 00:28:14.339
What are you going to do, it is for you to decide.

00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:22.180
If you are, if you have read few books
you cannot sit, settle Me into those books.

00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:24.598
You see, there is Yoga shastra. Now take Yoga shastra.

00:28:24.798 --> 00:28:28.297
Now yesterday he told you
there is saatwik yogashastra this.

00:28:28.497 --> 00:28:32.425
What should by yogashastra for Me what is it?

00:28:32.703 --> 00:28:36.733
Did Rama read any books or Krishna read
any book and I am going to read any book?

00:28:36.933 --> 00:28:40.787
Am I going to use this
Yogashastra? You see, this is for people,

00:28:40.987 --> 00:28:43.233
for human beings who have to climb up.

00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:47.807
I know everything. So why
should I worry about these things?

00:28:48.008 --> 00:28:51.020
I have to just pull you out;
that’s all. I know all the job.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.175
The person who knows the job doesn’t have to do this.

00:28:55.032 --> 00:28:57.733
And it comes to this that I have to tell you these things,

00:28:57.933 --> 00:29:01.941
you yourselves should realize that if
Mataji is doing like that just by chitta.

00:29:02.142 --> 00:29:04.501
Now see today there was, I’ll tell you a case.

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:08.085
Today there yesterday they told me about somebody,

00:29:08.285 --> 00:29:12.571
who, who is a brother [Is it our
brother – Marathi] who drinks too much

00:29:12.772 --> 00:29:15.315
and he is in Goa. I said, “What to do? How can he come?”

00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:19.323
He, he came today [aapo aap]. He came just like that.

00:29:22.475 --> 00:29:24.296
Just it is My attention, you see.

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:26.801
If you put anything to My attention it just works.

00:29:27.001 --> 00:29:31.233
I don’t have to bother. It is
something like a human being can lift this.

00:29:31.433 --> 00:29:34.291
Now an ant will say, “How did you lift it?”

00:29:34.492 --> 00:29:37.452
I mean, it is possible for a human being to lift it the,

00:29:37.652 --> 00:29:39.999
and for Me it is easy to lift your Kundalini’s

00:29:40.099 --> 00:29:42.755
and to do all these miscellaneous things like that

00:29:42.955 --> 00:29:45.400
because it is My attention,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.982
My attention, chitta. My attention itself is Ananda.

00:29:50.182 --> 00:29:54.163
It is itself, is bliss and it is itself, is the knowledge.

00:29:54.364 --> 00:29:57.359
I don’t need any intelligence to know anything because

00:29:57.559 --> 00:30:01.534
I know everything in My
head there is all the libraries there.

00:30:01.734 --> 00:30:05.390
Now you have read one book that fellow
has found out something from somewhere.

00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:09.509
Now how am I to tell you how this mad man
has found out something where from somewhere

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.624
and how did he find in darkness he what did he find?

00:30:12.825 --> 00:30:15.918
He might have found somebody’s
leg and was thinking it is somebody’s hand.

00:30:16.119 --> 00:30:20.342
Now for a person like Me it is
so difficult to go to every person.

00:30:20.542 --> 00:30:23.567
Anybody who has read a book
there, a sentence here, will come down.

00:30:23.767 --> 00:30:27.814
I said, “Now leave it. Now you want
your realization. Come along have it.”

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.421
And then the greatest problem is all this is love.

00:30:33.621 --> 00:30:37.733
I mean, I’m just a form of love;
that’s all. It’s nothing but love.

00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:42.067
It’s just love, you see, which
expands, gives you vibrations,

00:30:42.267 --> 00:30:45.119
again recedes back, expands, it comes back.

00:30:45.414 --> 00:30:50.417
It goes in a parabolic like that, what you
call the pradakshina of a shakti you are seeing.

00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:53.350
What is shakti is, shakti’s this thing is a parabolic,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.820
and now Einstein is talking about parabolic.

00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:59.466
We had a parabolic long time
back here. We knew it was shakti.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.707
See, you can explain all your science and everything.

00:31:02.907 --> 00:31:07.073
In this life I learnt English language and
little bit of science and psychology and all that,

00:31:07.273 --> 00:31:09.784
but these psychologists are so one-sided people.

00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:12.077
Yoga shastras are so one-sided people.

00:31:12.277 --> 00:31:14.403
Now they do not match each other.

00:31:14.603 --> 00:31:17.400
I’m telling you the basic principle between the two.

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:21.067
Both are human efforts. I’m a different person.

00:31:21.607 --> 00:31:24.067
Now what should I do if I’m like that?

00:31:24.647 --> 00:31:28.841
How can I become like you?
I mean, if I know how to come up,

00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:34.358
how should I become like a little baby and
say, “Oh, no, I must crawl up now gradually.”

00:31:38.982 --> 00:31:41.588
I’m an old woman of thousands of years.

00:31:41.788 --> 00:31:46.672
So I know everything. You are still
little babies. So how can I become like you?

00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:52.369
See, the simple thing and today is
the day I thought I better tell you about it

00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:57.772
that you just don’t worry about things
how I do things. I really do it. I cure people.

00:31:57.973 --> 00:32:00.567
Now here is a gentleman. He’s a heart patient, ask.

00:32:01.473 --> 00:32:04.693
Even before I met him he got quite cured, and I cured him.

00:32:04.894 --> 00:32:07.503
There are so many people here who will say that.

00:32:07.704 --> 00:32:10.908
[We told about our illness to Mataji – Marathi]

00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:15.228
Why? The question, the person who
asked me the question, you ask him.

00:32:15.656 --> 00:32:18.692
He has a friend who is in, who’s a Frenchman,

00:32:18.892 --> 00:32:22.050
and the Frenchman asked Me a
question about the Western life.

00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:26.307
So I didn’t answer it. I started saying
something else. He’s a very intelligent boy, this Rajesh.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.567
So Rajesh said, “Now, you see,
Mataji has not answered your question.

00:32:29.767 --> 00:32:32.129
That means She has recorded it and it will act,”

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.838
because in his case it has acted.

00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:40.507
So God, whatever He has done it is for your good.

00:32:40.707 --> 00:32:44.577
He has given you ego and super
-ego not to get spoiled and finished.

00:32:44.778 --> 00:32:47.067
Now you can’t blame God for that.

00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:52.190
Supposing God has given you light to go that way.

00:32:52.391 --> 00:32:55.733
He has told you, “Now take an
independent light to find out that.”

00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:59.567
And if you start burning yourself
with that light, what can God do?

00:33:00.973 --> 00:33:02.571
It is not God’s mistake.

00:33:02.925 --> 00:33:06.266
Many people think that this
ego is horrid. Ego you must have.

00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:09.067
Ego you must have. You are not to fight this ego.

00:33:09.267 --> 00:33:14.132
Only thing is that your ego should become one
with that of God. That’s all. It’s a very simple thing.

00:33:17.468 --> 00:33:19.678
If you just become one with that God –

00:33:19.878 --> 00:33:22.698
now supposing this has a ego, how can I talk on this?

00:33:22.898 --> 00:33:25.255
I’ll say something; it will say some.

00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:29.616
But if it has no ego, its ego
has become one with My saying,

00:33:29.816 --> 00:33:34.529
then it carries My voice. It carries
My sayings, everything. It is so simple.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.186
What is so much complicated

00:33:37.386 --> 00:33:40.365
when people start telling Me about big, big things,

00:33:40.565 --> 00:33:43.905
I really get a fright. I said, what is so complicated?

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.295
It is like, you see, somebody wanted
to know how do we make puris, you see.

00:33:49.626 --> 00:33:52.465
So a foreigner had come, a lady.

00:33:52.665 --> 00:33:55.456
So, she learnt, you know, how you make puris this thing,

00:33:55.556 --> 00:33:58.448
and one lady just tried to make fun of the whole thing.

00:33:58.649 --> 00:34:01.977
She said, “We make one roti here, one roti there.

00:34:02.177 --> 00:34:04.501
Then we put it one on top of another

00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:09.509
and then, all sorts of things. And
inside we put, something just to make it big

00:34:09.709 --> 00:34:14.444
and then we blow it out with
a phunkni,” and all those things.

00:34:14.645 --> 00:34:18.148
So this poor lady, she said that,
“How are you making it just like this,

00:34:18.348 --> 00:34:21.074
coming up like that. You are
putting in the kadhai, it’s coming up?”

00:34:21.275 --> 00:34:24.683
They said, “It is working out
because it’s the simplest thing to do,”

00:34:24.884 --> 00:34:28.351
but for her she said, “No, I was using a blower, blowing in

00:34:28.552 --> 00:34:31.370
because I thought that that’s the only way you can do it.”

00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:40.680
It is, it is a simple thing for
any housewife to create this thing.

00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:45.741
So you see for, when I hear all these
big, big things about yoga, this, that,

00:34:45.941 --> 00:34:49.159
then I said, “Baba, what are
you doing?” Now it is very simple.

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:53.349
It is a very simple thing,
but you can’t do it, is the point.

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:56.616
So I’m here. Once you are awakened,

00:34:56.816 --> 00:35:00.961
once your light has come, you can do it also. Why not?

00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:04.339
And I’ve told Gagangarh
Maharaj, when he started telling Me,

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:08.093
“Why I cannot give realization
to people like this the way these.

00:35:08.293 --> 00:35:10.622
I’ve gone so much and I’ve done so much of this thing

00:35:10.822 --> 00:35:12.676
[I have given to one & now he is of no use – Marathi]

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:15.733
and useless and how are You,
how are these people doing this?

00:35:15.933 --> 00:35:18.785
They will become very egoistical.” I said, “They will not.”

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.900
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “They
are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh;

00:35:24.786 --> 00:35:28.694
same powers they will have. Even with the finger moving,

00:35:28.894 --> 00:35:31.567
My sons can give realization.

00:35:31.976 --> 00:35:36.549
They can. Who are you to
challenge and ask Me?” He kept quiet.

00:35:36.749 --> 00:35:39.055
He said, “You are a Mother. Do what you please,

00:35:39.256 --> 00:35:43.733
[ but it is not for foolish people” I said - Marathi]

00:35:44.013 --> 00:35:46.232
I’m not giving to them.

00:35:48.073 --> 00:35:50.400
It is a fantastic thing, that’s why.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.645
You see, it is rather difficult for people to
understand, but anything like this has to be fantastic.

00:35:55.846 --> 00:35:58.233
And we have to prove the existence of God.

00:35:58.433 --> 00:36:00.900
We have to prove that He exists and He works,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:04.270
and all those people, chaitanya lahiris and all that,

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:09.476
talks about Kabira and Nanaka
and Hiranya Sanhita and all your yoga,

00:36:09.676 --> 00:36:14.132
I’m going to prove it to you before. Have
you ever seen any Kundalini pulsating before?

00:36:14.332 --> 00:36:17.625
I will show you the pulsation of a Kundalini.

00:36:20.379 --> 00:36:23.445
You have never heard that there are on the fingers

00:36:23.545 --> 00:36:26.400
anywhere the vibrations are coming, nothing,

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:30.664
but you have felt it not only
but you can diagnose a person.

00:36:30.865 --> 00:36:35.233
You can tell a person what he’s
suffering from. You can cure a person.

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:38.567
Now you will say, “How is it possible?”

00:36:38.767 --> 00:36:43.941
and somebody says, “Ten thousand
years before we never heard of these things.”

00:36:44.142 --> 00:36:46.626
Everything must happen ten thousand years ago.

00:36:46.726 --> 00:36:49.640
Then why are we proceeding further? Better go back.

00:36:50.211 --> 00:36:52.310
What kind of a argument is this?

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.474
After all, we have discovered going to the moon.

00:36:56.674 --> 00:36:59.339
Then we never say, “Why did we go to moon?”

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:02.459
You see, that’s a simple question there. We do not.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.400
But we have to know that
somebody is searching inside for you,

00:37:07.284 --> 00:37:09.029
and I’ve found it out.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.900
I’ve visited all these rakshasas also.
I’ve visited all these gurus, all of them,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.900
very nicely befooling them,

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.512
and I tried to find out what are they
up too. Now I also know their tricks.

00:37:20.917 --> 00:37:23.900
I know what they have done to
you, and that’s how I can correct.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.900
So I’ve studied all the
permutations and combinations and everything,

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:33.960
everything of Kundalini, whatever is possible
because, you know, it’s not so simple with human beings.

00:37:34.161 --> 00:37:39.596
They are very, very easily, they are very
easily can be persuaded. They can be enticed.

00:37:39.796 --> 00:37:43.900
They can be hypnotized – I cannot be hypnotized –

00:37:44.323 --> 00:37:47.950
but you can be very easily
hypnotized. Anybody can hypnotize you like that.

00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:51.739
I’ve seen thousands of people
getting hypnotized, taking out their clothes,

00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:55.107
dancing, jumping. I’ve
seen some people just making all

00:37:55.207 --> 00:37:58.708
kinds of faces, like this, like that, all sorts of things.

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:04.134
It can be done, and the hypnosis is so much that
when they come before Me also they start doing that.

00:38:04.334 --> 00:38:07.707
They just get into the
hypnosis because they are used to it.

00:38:07.908 --> 00:38:10.774
It’s like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

00:38:10.974 --> 00:38:14.900
They just become Mr. Hyde, and
Dr. Jekyll is lost. You become that;

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.973
it’s very common.

00:38:17.178 --> 00:38:20.370
So for you it is wise to understand that I know

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.900
all these things and I will tell you everything.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.437
I’ve got it for you specially

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:29.219
and I know all the permutations and combinations.

00:38:29.319 --> 00:38:31.733
You don’t have to do any research about it.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.575
No money is needed to be spent.

00:38:35.059 --> 00:38:38.674
Still, you see, there are people who have
been with Me for seven years. Still they are saying,

00:38:38.874 --> 00:38:41.762
“Mother, every time You say something we have to learn.”

00:38:41.963 --> 00:38:45.822
This is this, this is that, this is
combination, that is combination, everything.

00:38:46.022 --> 00:38:52.669
Even five lives will not be sufficient for
you to know a little bit about this knowledge.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.400
So why worry about these
research and things? Just listen to Me

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:02.537
and use your hands and learn and
discover also for yourself that this is the truth,

00:39:04.234 --> 00:39:08.136
and don’t listen to everyone,
third person coming round the corner,

00:39:08.336 --> 00:39:13.347
somebody selling the paan
there will tell you [Marathi] done.

00:39:13.855 --> 00:39:16.733
As if we have no brains at all, you see.

00:39:17.107 --> 00:39:21.120
So, you should not listen to
rumors. You are special people.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.669
By God’s grace you have got
vibrations. This is a very big thing.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.992
Those who haven’t got will also get it.

00:39:27.192 --> 00:39:29.567
I would request you every day

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:33.485
you have to sit on the water for seven days

00:39:33.787 --> 00:39:37.438
to see that you are cleared out now after realization

00:39:37.638 --> 00:39:42.295
and also later on whenever you are
tired. It’s better; that’s a bath for you.

00:39:42.495 --> 00:39:45.300
Every day do that treatment yourself. It’s a bath.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.419
You cleanse yourself because you gather. I do not gather.

00:39:49.619 --> 00:39:52.431
I, nothing happens to Me, but it happens to you.

00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:55.817
So, you must have a bath in the night,

00:39:56.017 --> 00:39:59.242
take out all the problems on that water, throw it away.

00:39:59.443 --> 00:40:03.400
Water with salt is a sea which
takes away all your problems.

00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:08.644
So try to do that, and there are so many
ways. We can use akasha. We can use prithvi.

00:40:08.844 --> 00:40:11.078
There are people; they can tell you; they know.

00:40:11.278 --> 00:40:14.939
I’ve told them that five-six people
should come here. We have a brain trust.

00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:18.317
They will be all sitting down here and talking to you.

00:40:18.634 --> 00:40:22.096
So next time when you come,
if you have any problem you can ask.

00:40:22.296 --> 00:40:26.493
Now maybe you are learned but you
can learn from them. Even person like,

00:40:26.693 --> 00:40:30.400
Justice Vaidya told Me that,
“I must know more about Sahaja Yoga.”

00:40:30.901 --> 00:40:34.853
So I said it is more practical than theoretical,

00:40:35.054 --> 00:40:41.422
and if he comes to the program or if somebody
can go to him or if he can work it out with his hand,

00:40:41.622 --> 00:40:45.950
gradually he will be become a master
of this because as it is he has knowledge.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:50.233
It will fit into it as if, as if the
Ganges will flow into the, all the,

00:40:51.298 --> 00:40:56.400
all the ditches or all the things
that are made to receive the water

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.148
and it will just go and settle into it, perfectly.

00:41:00.537 --> 00:41:02.771
Your reading is not going to be wasted,

00:41:02.971 --> 00:41:06.140
but you will know what is right what is wrong.

00:41:10.317 --> 00:41:12.742
Now if there is another question for one question

00:41:12.942 --> 00:41:15.936
I’ve taken so much time because
it was a very important question.

00:41:16.138 --> 00:41:18.837
Seeker: What is bath?

00:41:19.037 --> 00:41:23.005
[Bath means you have to kept my
photograph in front of me – Marathi]

00:41:23.206 --> 00:41:26.024
The photo has the vibrations; is a fact.

00:41:26.224 --> 00:41:28.789
Also, there are many things that have vibrations.

00:41:28.889 --> 00:41:31.553
For example, even this statue has got vibrations.

00:41:31.954 --> 00:41:35.739
Even these two statues have, but
not so much as they are from Me.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.443
First of all, I am a living being.
Another is that their proportions,

00:41:39.643 --> 00:41:43.736
may be wrong because they are
created by human beings, by their imagination,

00:41:43.937 --> 00:41:46.430
but the swayambhu lingaas, all of them have got.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.755
For example, now supposing
you have a prostate gland problem,

00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:53.723
if you go to the, say, to any of these

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:07.446
[What is their name? Where did we
went to that Ganapati? No Titwala – Marathi]

00:42:07.646 --> 00:42:10.412
Raanjhan gaaon, Raanjhan gaaon Ganapati.

00:42:10.613 --> 00:42:13.649
You see, I went there. It has complete vibrations.

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:18.545
Titwala because it is, you see, too much
visited by people. So it gets crowded sometimes,

00:42:18.746 --> 00:42:20.858
but Raanjhan gaaon I found still all right;

00:42:21.058 --> 00:42:26.158
but as soon I say Raanjhan gaaon everybody will go to
Raanjhan gaaon and the Raanjhan gaaon also will be spoiled.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.067
Because after all these are the,

00:42:30.267 --> 00:42:34.839
these are the special statues
which have come out by Mother Earth.

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:36.888
She’s thrown them. Mother Earth thinks,

00:42:37.089 --> 00:42:42.162
She creates these things and She
throws these things and they give vibrations.

00:42:42.362 --> 00:42:45.039
So, you take vibrations from them all.

00:42:45.239 --> 00:42:48.512
But My photograph is a photograph as a reality.

00:42:48.713 --> 00:42:54.220
[Nobody has clicked the photo of Ram or Krishna – Marathi].

00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:59.297
Another thing is, you see, whatever I
speak, because I’m that, it is pranava flowing.

00:42:59.497 --> 00:43:04.314
It is actual pranava. By every talk,
everything, is a mantra going into,

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:07.733
and when I just put My finger also into it I found

00:43:07.934 --> 00:43:10.233
that My vibrations can be turned around.

00:43:10.433 --> 00:43:16.004
Even when I do like this,
those who are realized can feel it.

00:43:16.314 --> 00:43:19.614
On their Sahasrara they can feel; is a fact.

00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:23.116
So why should it look so funny to people?

00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:34.031
[What is their question? If you see all their chakra [Unclear]

00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:41.727
Please read it. They have asked about bath – Marathi]

00:43:41.928 --> 00:43:44.888
It is a simple method. You put my photograph in

00:43:44.988 --> 00:43:47.984
a proper place, put a little light before it.

00:43:48.184 --> 00:43:51.541
Candle will do, or you
can put a niraanjan, whatever you like.

00:43:51.742 --> 00:43:53.688
Put both the hands towards the photograph.

00:43:53.888 --> 00:43:56.572
Now you put both the hands towards the photograph

00:43:56.672 --> 00:43:59.067
and feet in the water with a little salt.

00:43:59.267 --> 00:44:04.495
You can have little hot water, cold water or
warm water according, according to the need.

00:44:04.695 --> 00:44:09.400
Supposing you are sick, suffering from cold,
so better to take the warm water. Put a little salt in it.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.341
Put your hands towards the photograph.

00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:14.733
You’ll be amazed that the whole
trouble will go away into the water,

00:44:14.933 --> 00:44:17.548
and you can throw away the water in the W.C.

00:44:17.748 --> 00:44:21.468
and you’ll be very much clear. Now this gentleman you ask.

00:44:21.668 --> 00:44:26.733
He did that. He had a heart attack. He was very serious.

00:44:27.147 --> 00:44:29.518
Everybody can do it. Now for vishudhhi chakra,

00:44:29.618 --> 00:44:32.667
especially this chakra, another simple thing you can try,

00:44:32.867 --> 00:44:36.619
is to put your right hand towards the
photograph first and take out the left hand.

00:44:36.819 --> 00:44:39.071
Supposing you find the vibrations are flowing into it,

00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:43.067
then you put left hand towards
the photograph and right hand outside

00:44:43.338 --> 00:44:47.856
and you will be surprised that the whole
thing will clear out this chakra very well.

00:44:48.457 --> 00:44:53.400
And if you keep your eyes open towards
the photograph and put your hands like this

00:44:54.298 --> 00:44:56.659
or sometimes like this on the akaashaa,

00:44:56.859 --> 00:45:00.374
you’ll be surprised that your eyes
can be improved, very much with this.

00:45:00.575 --> 00:45:04.338
Mother Earth also; if you put
your head on the Mother Earth,

00:45:04.538 --> 00:45:08.835
just touch her with your forehead and say,

00:45:09.035 --> 00:45:11.673
“Mother forgive me for touching you with my feet,”

00:45:11.873 --> 00:45:16.067
and She’s your grandmother.
You ask for anything and you will get.

00:45:16.439 --> 00:45:19.438
They are all waiting to give you whatever you want.

00:45:19.638 --> 00:45:24.082
You can ask the help of Hanumana.
You can ask the help of Ganesha.

00:45:24.283 --> 00:45:27.233
The other day the newspaper people told Me,

00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:31.580
they are two disciples of Mine who are
correspondents and they were going somewhere

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.973
and they had there My photograph with them.

00:45:34.174 --> 00:45:38.660
They said, “It was so amazing that we
were coming and while coming driving,

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.803
our driver just bumped into a truck and we said,

00:45:41.903 --> 00:45:44.759
‘We are all finished,’ and we closed our eyes.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.828
When we opened our eyes the
truck was ahead and we were here.

00:45:48.028 --> 00:45:51.839
We didn’t know how we were saved,
all of us. And the driver had also closed his eyes.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.233
We didn’t know how the truck
went that side and how we were here.”

00:45:55.958 --> 00:45:59.400
So accidents are avoided.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.807
Things can happen, and people have seen.

00:46:03.124 --> 00:46:07.295
They live long and you have
good health. Everything is there.

00:46:07.495 --> 00:46:11.295
After all, we have to, we have
jumped into the kingdom of God.

00:46:11.495 --> 00:46:14.567
Only thing is keep your seeds all right for the time being.

00:46:14.767 --> 00:46:17.579
Then the whole thing will be lifted up like this

00:46:17.679 --> 00:46:20.592
into satyugaa. Already the satyugaa has started.

00:46:22.484 --> 00:46:24.068
[What is the question? – Marathi]

00:46:24.269 --> 00:46:28.213
Seeker: If we see all the six chakras nearly

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:34.485
each one there exist some or the other endocrine gland.

00:46:39.045 --> 00:46:42.799
What relation this chakra has with this gland?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.666
Shri Mataji: Now endocrine glands
are controlled by the chakras also.

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:51.067
For example, now we can say Mooladhara chakra,

00:46:51.267 --> 00:46:53.918
controls this prostate like that.

00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:58.644
Even the Agnya chakra controls
the pituitary and pineal, both of them,

00:46:58.844 --> 00:47:01.696
and that’s how it controls the ego and super-ego.

00:47:01.897 --> 00:47:07.174
So it has a controlling effect on that very
much. They are the growth agents of that.

00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:12.188
You see, for example, to control
all the nature God has fixed up the stars.

00:47:12.388 --> 00:47:16.343
Certain stars are there, nine, nine stars mostly;

00:47:16.543 --> 00:47:21.668
the seven stars, as you know, and
two more are placed there to control,

00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:25.057
the Universe and the everything.

00:47:25.258 --> 00:47:27.230
It is controlled through those points and

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:31.733
you know so it affects our physical, material life,

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.775
the whole planet.

00:47:36.402 --> 00:47:42.701
Seeker: Respected Mataji, please give me
the knowledge and show me more clearly the way.

00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:45.024
First, what are the vibrations,

00:47:45.224 --> 00:47:49.733
[unclear], physiologically, scientifically and spiritually?

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:53.400
Second, where do they, these vibrations come from

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.186
– from You, cosmos or atmosphere?

00:47:57.387 --> 00:48:00.073
What way do the vibrations benefit us?

00:48:00.273 --> 00:48:04.225
What are the do’s and don'ts for Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:09.489
Shri Mataji: Very good question, very
good. Who has asked the question, very.

00:48:10.045 --> 00:48:13.827
First question is about what are these vibrations.

00:48:14.027 --> 00:48:19.900
I told you yesterday that in
our heart there is a flicker of light

00:48:20.496 --> 00:48:23.567
which is burning all the time, which is the Aatma

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:27.567
which is the reflection of Paramatma in our heart.

00:48:28.075 --> 00:48:30.628
In short I’ll tell you; the details I will not.

00:48:30.886 --> 00:48:33.567
Now what happens, the Kundalini rises,

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:38.567
she opens the Brahmarandhra and
there is the seat of the Sadashiva, the peetha.

00:48:38.767 --> 00:48:43.567
You see, the peetha is here, but
Shiva is in the heart reflected as the Aatma.

00:48:43.767 --> 00:48:46.884
You see the peetha and the peetha is created

00:48:46.984 --> 00:48:50.558
because, you see, the peetha receives the subtle.

00:48:50.759 --> 00:48:56.067
You see, it receives the subtle
energy which is all-pervading, the gross.

00:48:56.537 --> 00:49:01.922
Inside all the pervading, for
example, this collects My voice.

00:49:02.624 --> 00:49:06.122
Voice is a subtle energy which is collected through this.

00:49:06.323 --> 00:49:11.453
Here now we have all kinds of
pictures and all kinds of music going on,

00:49:11.653 --> 00:49:14.733
but if you have a radio it can capture.

00:49:14.966 --> 00:49:17.676
In the same way the peethas are in the brain

00:49:17.876 --> 00:49:21.411
and the peetha of the Sadashiva is higher up here

00:49:21.611 --> 00:49:28.161
which is opened out so that the subtle,

00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:32.658
the sukshama in the gross passes into our heart

00:49:32.858 --> 00:49:35.374
through a very subtle channel

00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:40.316
and just like a gas light it has a flicker

00:49:40.516 --> 00:49:43.823
and when the gas opens out the prakaashsa comes in.

00:49:44.195 --> 00:49:49.067
Now the vibrations are, are the,
that prakaasha going through us.

00:49:49.267 --> 00:49:51.664
These vibrations start flowing through us.

00:49:51.865 --> 00:49:55.233
Now what do I do? You will say, “Mataji what do You do?”

00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:59.906
I do nothing but I just try to give you that force

00:50:00.106 --> 00:50:03.285
which is the, we can say, the gas power.

00:50:03.486 --> 00:50:09.233
That is the gas power because the Kundalini
knows that when I am before you, she rises,

00:50:09.433 --> 00:50:11.851
she opens out and it starts flowing.

00:50:12.052 --> 00:50:14.265
It is flowing through Me throughout, but unless and

00:50:14.365 --> 00:50:16.900
until you are subtle you cannot feel it and you have it.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:21.733
It is, you can say that I am like a,

00:50:28.696 --> 00:50:33.233
you can say that I am the finite in the infinite,

00:50:33.433 --> 00:50:37.567
or you can say the infinite in the finite;

00:50:41.299 --> 00:50:44.223
infinite into the finite

00:50:44.423 --> 00:50:49.067
and also the finite into the infinite.

00:50:49.267 --> 00:50:50.869
I’m both.

00:50:51.449 --> 00:50:52.901
[Did you understood – Marathi]

00:50:54.465 --> 00:50:59.900
So the energy that is emitted into all
the subtle energy is passing through Me,

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:04.974
is the Viraat. From the
Viraat, say, the whole thing passes.

00:51:05.251 --> 00:51:09.883
It is going into the all-pervading. It is
all-pervading everybody. Everywhere it is going.

00:51:10.084 --> 00:51:12.233
Even it is in a cell in everything.

00:51:12.433 --> 00:51:17.020
In a carbon atom it is there. Into all
atoms, into all arrangements it is working.

00:51:17.221 --> 00:51:20.446
It is the subtle energy that is emitted through Me.

00:51:20.647 --> 00:51:24.733
When you become subtle you
become like a radio; you start receiving it.

00:51:25.075 --> 00:51:27.067
Now how will you know?

00:51:28.178 --> 00:51:32.078
what is correct what is incorrect? You
ask the subtle, and the subtle answers you,

00:51:32.278 --> 00:51:36.009
and you get the answers on your hands. It is like that.

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:39.271
So, these are the vibrations which you receive

00:51:39.656 --> 00:51:41.993
from the All-pervading Power

00:51:42.193 --> 00:51:46.109
and the All-pervading Power is emitted out

00:51:47.288 --> 00:51:51.233
and you receive it from Me or from the All-pervading.

00:51:51.433 --> 00:51:55.900
It’s just the same from
everywhere these are the vibrations.

00:51:56.369 --> 00:52:01.480
But the Self-realization means, which is a
very subtle point, which you try to understand now

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:07.116
that it is so far is an unconscious for you.

00:52:07.317 --> 00:52:09.358
Your aatma is in the unconscious.

00:52:09.558 --> 00:52:13.400
It is not in your awareness; it is in the achetana.

00:52:13.728 --> 00:52:17.368
It is in your unconscious, means it is in the achetana.

00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:20.311
You are not yet chetit about it.

00:52:20.511 --> 00:52:23.233
You are not aware of it, all right?

00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:27.866
But once you are realized
it starts flowing into your awareness,

00:52:28.066 --> 00:52:31.128
means you start feeling it in your central nervous system,

00:52:31.328 --> 00:52:36.620
because your central nervous
system is your chetna, is your awareness.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.386
The human awareness is nothing
but is central nervous system,

00:52:40.587 --> 00:52:45.233
but his central nervous system
starts feeling now the vibrations,

00:52:45.433 --> 00:52:47.930
the light of the aatma through it.

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:52.614
So that, that is why it is known as
samaadhi. Samaadhi means the unconscious.

00:52:52.815 --> 00:52:56.978
When the unconscious becomes the conscious,

00:52:57.179 --> 00:52:59.900
it is called as samaadhi.

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:03.778
So people think beshudha hone, beshudha nahin.

00:53:03.978 --> 00:53:07.374
It means you become aware of the unconscious.

00:53:07.574 --> 00:53:10.733
Not only that, but first you become Nirvichaar,

00:53:10.933 --> 00:53:15.113
then Nirvikalpa and then a complete Self-realization.

00:53:16.145 --> 00:53:19.446
So, the Samaadhi is a word, a great confusion.

00:53:19.647 --> 00:53:22.733
Samaadhi just means an universal unconscious.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:25.900
It means the universal unconscious and unconscious

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:57.885
[People think that become
unconscious is samadhi [Unclear] – Marathi].

00:53:58.086 --> 00:54:00.855
If you are unconscious in the sense,

00:54:01.056 --> 00:54:05.751
now supposing somebody gives you an injection or
you take a drug you become unconscious, means what?

00:54:05.952 --> 00:54:08.900
You go into subconscious or into supra-conscious,

00:54:09.556 --> 00:54:11.492
but this is a superconsciousness

00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:16.185
and superconsciousness, is
all-pervading sarvavyaapi, sukshama.

00:54:18.642 --> 00:54:22.400
Yesterday what he told you about three types of saadhnaas:

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.648
saatvik and raajasik and taamasik.

00:54:26.849 --> 00:54:29.654
Taamasik goes to the left side, means into the subconscious

00:54:29.854 --> 00:54:33.249
and collective sub-conscious
connected with the libido on the left hand side,

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:38.366
and right side is the supra-
conscious connected with the Pingala naadi

00:54:38.566 --> 00:54:41.067
which is the willpower, as you call it,

00:54:41.267 --> 00:54:45.733
and connected to the supra-conscious
side, goes to the collective supra-conscious.

00:54:46.758 --> 00:54:50.916
Dev and all these people are sitting that
side, Dev, Devtaas and these are officers, you see.

00:54:51.117 --> 00:54:53.334
Ganas are on this side on the top,

00:54:53.535 --> 00:54:56.567
and all those who fail into that, they go into hell.

00:54:56.767 --> 00:54:59.233
But the center is the super-conscious.

00:54:59.433 --> 00:55:02.733
For the Sushumna the human
being rise above the super-consciousness.

00:55:04.497 --> 00:55:09.567
They gradually start becoming more
and more aware. They have the same body.

00:55:09.831 --> 00:55:14.400
For example, if you look at a cell
of the brain, is the same as the cell

00:55:16.037 --> 00:55:20.271
of a fat globule, but there is a difference.

00:55:20.471 --> 00:55:25.014
So, the difference starts taking, and
by the time you open out from here,

00:55:25.214 --> 00:55:29.634
then there is given a greater dimension to that cell, your brain,

00:55:31.078 --> 00:55:34.733
that it starts receiving
the vibrations and can understand it.

00:55:36.236 --> 00:55:39.900
And then even is a greater,
in Nirvikalpa you get another dimension

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:44.233
where you have no doubts; you are knowledge.

00:55:45.568 --> 00:55:49.695
And the last is the Self-realization where you are just in joy,

00:55:50.401 --> 00:55:53.441
complete in joy, no problems.

00:55:53.848 --> 00:55:57.400
You do not catch; nothing happens.

00:56:02.261 --> 00:56:07.715
I would say our Vaidya saheb is very
much near Self-realization, very much near.

00:56:07.915 --> 00:56:10.900
The way he got his Self-realization itself is remarkable

00:56:11.204 --> 00:56:15.567
because he felt two ice cubes
coming into him and melting out,

00:56:15.767 --> 00:56:18.212
but he doesn’t catch, you know.

00:56:18.462 --> 00:56:22.127
I told him about somebody. He said,
“I know he is no good. He is a tamasic fellow.

00:56:22.328 --> 00:56:25.387
Let him go according to his karmas, Mataji. What to do?’

00:56:25.588 --> 00:56:29.000
You see, he doesn’t catch, but you people will catch.

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:35.184
[Now the next question is about physiological – Marathi]

00:56:35.384 --> 00:56:39.424
Physiological, physiological, you can feel
it on the hand. You can feel on the fingers.

00:56:39.624 --> 00:56:44.286
[Read that Marathi book.
Everything is written in that – Marathi]

00:56:44.486 --> 00:56:55.700
Seeker: Tell scientifically
Shri Mataji: [What to tell scientifically in this – Marathi]

00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:00.624
Scientifically you can say the parasympathetic gets
activated. You get the control of the parasympathetic.

00:57:00.825 --> 00:57:03.567
You jump into the unconscious, the universal unconscious.

00:57:03.767 --> 00:57:06.500
These are the two points you can say. Now what is the

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.687
[Told spiritually – Marathi]

00:57:09.887 --> 00:57:13.144
Seeker: Where do the vibrations
come from? From me, from Her?

00:57:13.416 --> 00:57:14.900
Shri Mataji: From everywhere.

00:57:16.986 --> 00:57:20.026
I am the emitting force, all right. Accept it.

00:57:20.243 --> 00:57:23.470
Seeker: What are you doing
to have it..[inaudible]..what way?

00:57:23.671 --> 00:57:26.233
Shri Mataji: Now this is the vital force of life.

00:57:27.178 --> 00:57:30.400
You see it; it gives you a complete balance.

00:57:31.464 --> 00:57:35.233
It corrects your physical
being, it corrects your mental being,

00:57:35.433 --> 00:57:37.233
it corrects your emotional being,

00:57:37.433 --> 00:57:41.733
it gives you a complete spiritual oneness with God

00:57:41.933 --> 00:57:44.400
and it integrates you completely.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:48.941
I mean, as far as I am concerned, I have no
pashchataap. I don’t understand what is pashchataap..

00:57:49.142 --> 00:57:51.567
I don’t understand what is temptation.

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:55.874
I don’t understand these things
because I am complete one with Myself.

00:57:56.074 --> 00:58:01.453
Every, every finger I move, every hand I
move, everything I do, it means something.

00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:06.900
I have to do, I mean, it is done without
thinking, but there is a big thought behind it.

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.733
It is done because I say haan,

00:58:10.226 --> 00:58:11.889
I say haan,

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.470
I say haan.

00:58:14.671 --> 00:58:16.690
Haan means there is a noose, you know it.

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:20.596
There is a formation of a circle which works.

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:24.521
Now it’s difficult you know my
mechanism is different from you.

00:58:24.771 --> 00:58:29.639
So I can’t explain what I do because
you don’t have those mechanics within you,

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:34.132
but it is like that. Even saying huun, haan, hein,

00:58:34.426 --> 00:58:36.636
all these are tremendous words.

00:58:36.836 --> 00:58:42.900
They create a kind of a force and
a kind of a whirlwind, we can say.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:46.567
A kind of a formation takes in which it engulfs

00:58:46.767 --> 00:58:52.219
all the bad things that are there or all the
rakshasas and all those things and can pull them out.

00:58:52.487 --> 00:58:59.095
Now I gave it in the matka; just I put My breath in that.

00:58:59.296 --> 00:59:02.633
It’s pranava itself, complete, and that pranava,

00:59:02.833 --> 00:59:05.582
you see in the night when
they will be sleeping, will come out

00:59:05.783 --> 00:59:09.553
and take out all these things
gradually and bind them and put them inside.

00:59:09.754 --> 00:59:11.906
You have seen many mad people are cured like this,

00:59:12.106 --> 00:59:14.953
but to look at it looks like matka and people say,

00:59:15.153 --> 00:59:17.733
“What is this Mataji is telling
matka matka?” and this and that.

00:59:17.933 --> 00:59:22.411
And I have told you about the Civil
Surgeon of Ahmedabad, what happened to him.

00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:26.763
He told Me, “I can’t do all these
nonsensical things.” He was so angry.

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:32.160
“You want me to befool me. I can’t listen to all
this.” I said, “All right, you go ahead. I don’t say,”

00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:34.506
and he had become little bit loony.

00:59:34.706 --> 00:59:38.079
I said, “All right, I don’t say. All right, don’t bring matka,”

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:43.391
and third day when I was giving a lecture he
was coming there with such a big matka on his head.

00:59:45.026 --> 00:59:49.331
So I said, “Doctor,” after the
lecture. I couldn’t help laugh.

00:59:49.532 --> 00:59:52.567
After the lecture I said,
“Why did you bring such a big matka?

00:59:52.767 --> 00:59:56.477
I had not asked you to bring such a big
matka. I had asked you to bring such a small matka.”

00:59:56.677 --> 01:00:00.900
He said, “Mataji, your maaya. That’s
how you have killed my ego completely

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.067
because in the market there was no small matka available.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.900
Only this big one was available.

01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:14.810
So I had to bring such a big matka.”
And he was walking through the whole thing,

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.485
and I was looking at him and I didn’t know where to look.

01:00:17.685 --> 01:00:20.482
I said, “Look at the Civil
Surgeon,” and that convinced people.

01:00:20.682 --> 01:00:25.224
[Oh Civil Surgeon, a big man carrying such a
big matka on his head & going towards Shri Mataji.

01:00:25.425 --> 01:00:28.748
Inside is bhoot or mad? – Marathi]

01:00:28.949 --> 01:00:32.980
Poor Civil Surgeon, but he is a very good man and he’s cured, thank God.

01:00:33.181 --> 01:00:35.733
So it is like this. Then he retired also after that,

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:39.567
and he is a very good
Sahaja Yogi, still. So it doesn’t matter.

01:00:39.767 --> 01:00:44.148
You know these things are not important.
Mother says, “All right, matka to matkaa.”

01:00:46.173 --> 01:00:51.573
[Shri Krishna cracked Matka. Everything has
a meaning. I will tell you everything & listen it.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:01:02.690
He told Sahaja Yoga in Gokul. It is fun.
Why did he crack matka ? Does it have meaning? -Marathi]

01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:07.728
You will not find it in any book. You
will not know it anymore but Mataji knows.

01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:10.400
She knows all the tricks of Krishna, after all.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.878
She’s told you all His tricks also.

01:01:13.156 --> 01:01:18.167
[And if it is false you see it.
Now questions are finished – Marathi]

01:01:18.368 --> 01:01:20.765
Seeker: What are the do's and don’ts of Sahaja Yoga?

01:01:20.966 --> 01:01:24.604
Shri Mataji: Don’ts and do's; first and foremost things,

01:01:24.804 --> 01:01:28.067
that a Sahaja yogi cannot smoke or drink.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:32.695
One absolutely one hundred percent sure,

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:36.604
because if you drink or smoke you will find after some time

01:01:36.804 --> 01:01:39.400
you either you’ll lose your
vibrations or you’ll start vomiting.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.994
You cannot smoke.

01:01:41.195 --> 01:01:44.121
If you smoke your Vishudhdhi will be caught.

01:01:44.322 --> 01:01:47.151
If you drink your Nabhi chakra will be caught

01:01:47.351 --> 01:01:51.525
and whenever you’ll place your hand towards the
photograph all the Nabhi chakra will be burning absolutely.

01:01:51.726 --> 01:01:53.965
So you’ll say, “What is this
happening?” And you’ll give up.

01:01:54.165 --> 01:01:57.049
You sort of, many people
have done it without any difficulty.

01:01:57.249 --> 01:01:59.349
They do not have any difficulty; they just give up.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:04.400
So this is one of the most important
things that you have to gradually give up.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.400
Just take My name; you can work it out. We have
people here, they will tell you they were alcoholics,

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.778
they were taking drugs and
they were doing all kinds of things.

01:02:13.978 --> 01:02:16.859
They’ve given up all that and now
they are absolutely normal people.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.790
First thing is that: don’t drink and don’t smoke.

01:02:22.033 --> 01:02:24.233
Secondly, don’t fast.

01:02:24.604 --> 01:02:27.067
When Mother is there you are not to fast.

01:02:27.267 --> 01:02:31.563
Only fast on Naraka Chaturdashi; that’s
all. One day you should not have pharal.

01:02:31.763 --> 01:02:36.627
[On that day wake up at 12:00 PM. Eat well – Marathi].

01:02:36.828 --> 01:02:41.080
If you don’t feel like eating, eat
something else but don’t leave your stomach empty.

01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:44.523
You can have some fruit juice or milk or whatever you like.

01:02:44.724 --> 01:02:48.253
These are certain things about the
food and the stomach, Nabhi chakra.

01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:51.124
Secondly, the eyes are very important things

01:02:51.324 --> 01:02:55.505
where you have to be careful not to
move your eyes very fast anywhere.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:59.487
Try to keep your eyes steady
and mostly on the Mother Earth.

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:01.969
You see, you have heard about Lakshamana.

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:06.839
He never saw the feet of
Sitaji, never, or never saw Her face.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.869
He only saw Her feet. How can that be?

01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:13.127
He was always living with Her. He had never seen her face;

01:03:13.327 --> 01:03:15.427
he had just seen His feet.

01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:18.433
So, you can imagine what should be the position,

01:03:18.633 --> 01:03:22.633
and for fourteen years he had
to lead a complete brahmacharyaa’s life.

01:03:22.834 --> 01:03:28.310
He just, She was like his mother. He knew
She was Adi Shakti, but he just saw Her feet.

01:03:28.817 --> 01:03:34.094
That should be our case, this thing, that
we should lead a sanctified married life.

01:03:34.295 --> 01:03:36.567
Now supposing somebody is married;

01:03:36.767 --> 01:03:41.733
then he should not run away with other women, and
the other women should not run away with other men.

01:03:41.933 --> 01:03:44.400
And lead a sanctified life,

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.833
create a nest of family,

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:51.163
a proper family house, try to adopt, compromise,

01:03:51.363 --> 01:03:55.112
adjust, make your wife realize or make your husband realize

01:03:55.313 --> 01:03:57.394
and bring peace in the family

01:03:57.595 --> 01:04:01.284
because there are many great souls
who want to take birth, many of them.

01:04:01.485 --> 01:04:04.567
As soon as you’ll find that such marriages will take place

01:04:04.767 --> 01:04:10.233
they’ve seen now in our case, you can ask
some people from we have here. Ask these girls.

01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:12.817
There I told them that you must marry.

01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:17.108
So, one girl married and she
has a daughter absolutely realized.

01:04:17.308 --> 01:04:19.414
So many people have got realized children.

01:04:19.614 --> 01:04:20.683
[Marathi].

01:04:20.884 --> 01:04:24.567
So many those who got married
like this, they have all realized people.

01:04:24.767 --> 01:04:29.233
So, you must try to get a family life, a proper family,

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.175
proper relationship.

01:04:31.375 --> 01:04:35.866
Do service to your parents, to your
mothers. Don’t find faults with your parents

01:04:36.067 --> 01:04:41.810
and try to be kind to them, also to
the kind to the wife’s mother parents also

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:47.227
and try to be good in the family. Try
to bring more peace if they are difficult.

01:04:47.427 --> 01:04:52.335
I mean, it’s all right. Don’t spoil the children also.

01:04:52.535 --> 01:04:54.994
Correct them, make them loving.

01:04:55.534 --> 01:04:59.400
Make a nice society. Every
one of you should be the carrier,

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.990
of love of your Mother, everywhere.

01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:05.829
That is one thing, If you are Sahaja yogis

01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:08.576
and if you change and transform in your behavior,

01:05:08.777 --> 01:05:14.094
naturally Sahaja Yoga will have its own
reputation and everybody will start taking to Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:14.295 --> 01:05:17.290
[Doing Sahaj yoga & smuggling doing
is no good. It will not happen – Marathi]

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.287
Impossible.

01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:22.227
If you do anything like that,

01:05:22.427 --> 01:05:24.406
immediately your vibrations will go away.

01:05:24.606 --> 01:05:27.835
There was a gentleman in America, who got realization,

01:05:28.035 --> 01:05:32.236
and he started an ashram
of Sahaja Yoga, started taking money.

01:05:32.436 --> 01:05:36.067
When he came here people told Me,
“Mataji, we get a chakker with this man.

01:05:36.267 --> 01:05:39.754
What’s wrong with him, You tell me.”
Immediately in meditation I knew what was it is.

01:05:39.954 --> 01:05:42.656
I said, “Give Me the pamphlet.” He gave Me the pamphlet.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.840
I said, “You can’t earn money.

01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:50.322
If you earn money you’ll have a bad time,” and he
had a very bad time after that and he had earlier also.

01:05:50.522 --> 01:05:52.067
Now he’s all right.

01:05:52.267 --> 01:05:56.684
He says, “I will do some other work.”
You cannot earn any money from Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:56.885 --> 01:06:02.067
Do not have Sahaja yogis for business
partnership. No, they are Sahaja yogis.

01:06:02.267 --> 01:06:04.766
Do not use Sahaja Yoga for making money,

01:06:04.967 --> 01:06:08.091
[Someone stole pair of shoes the other day – Marathi].

01:06:08.292 --> 01:06:12.651
You see, this kind of this limit, this
type of people can never be Sahaja yogis.

01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:17.235
You have to be generous people.
You have to be absolutely honest

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:27.674
[Someone stole my things. It is a
nonsense. Are you to theft? – Marathi].

01:06:27.903 --> 01:06:33.900
They are thieves. They just come here for thieving.
They are not Sahaja yogis. So such people are also there.

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:39.676
[They take pair of shoes – Marathi]

01:06:39.877 --> 01:06:42.858
This should not be done. There
are Ten Commandments, as you say,

01:06:43.059 --> 01:06:47.757
and you should not take anybody’s
things, and be satisfied in your heart.

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:52.148
This is a very simple way of doing
things, but you have to lead a chaste life

01:06:52.348 --> 01:06:54.982
and you have to also see chaste things.

01:06:55.182 --> 01:07:00.067
For example, [Bad movies is not good - Marathi]
you will not like it also. Your priorities will change.

01:07:00.267 --> 01:07:03.643
Your friends will change gradually.
You will not like dirty jokes, nothing.

01:07:03.843 --> 01:07:06.067
You’ll just change and you’ll run away from them.

01:07:06.267 --> 01:07:11.400
I’ve seen these foreigners; now they are telling
Me that they just cannot stand all these things now.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.135
Once upon a time whatever they
could tolerate and enjoy also sometimes,

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:19.400
they just cannot stand it and bear
it because now you have become saintly.

01:07:19.684 --> 01:07:21.900
You have to be decent people.

01:07:23.382 --> 01:07:37.323
[No need to do politics. Unclear] – Marathi]

01:07:37.823 --> 01:07:41.382
So don’t dabble into all these rumors and frivolous things.

01:07:41.582 --> 01:07:44.900
Don’t waste your precious life. You
are Sahaja yogis. Not a single moment,

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.341
to be wasted on all nonsensical things.

01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:50.259
Every moment should be spent in,

01:07:50.459 --> 01:07:54.608
having dignity for yourself, for others, for loving others.

01:07:54.808 --> 01:07:57.644
[If someone wants something give it to them – Marathi].

01:07:57.844 --> 01:08:02.706
Don’t be misers at all. Miserly
people are against Sahaja Yoga,

01:08:02.907 --> 01:08:05.257
and if miserly people come I give them trouble.

01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:09.567
If you are miserly you get lots of troubles.
So you don’t get miserly, haan, I’m telling you

01:08:09.823 --> 01:08:11.804
and don’t be too talkative also,

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.088
become too talkative and
troublesome. I can stop your talking,

01:08:15.288 --> 01:08:17.474
and if you don’t talk at all that’s also not good.

01:08:17.674 --> 01:08:21.916
Means don’t go to extremes of anything.
These are certain things which you have to know.

01:08:22.117 --> 01:08:26.017
And don’t, women should not dress up like
men, and men should not behave like women.

01:08:26.217 --> 01:08:28.567
All these nonsenses you
should not do. You should be yourself.

01:08:28.767 --> 01:08:34.016
Supposing you are something in something you
are doing you should wear the dresses as you are;

01:08:34.216 --> 01:08:37.560
now no need to wear funny dresses and go round and

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.925
have your hair up to this much or try to show off.

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:44.466
You see, all these are mythical things. Be normal, natural people

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:48.760
and lead a normal, natural, decent life, and it’s not so important.

01:08:48.961 --> 01:08:53.067
Food is not so important. Whatever you get you get you eat,

01:08:53.267 --> 01:08:58.351
and don’t talk too much of comfort and
don’t also sleep on the thorns, no, no, no,

01:08:58.552 --> 01:09:00.809
but don’t be absolutely a waster.

01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:04.000
Be in the center; is a very simple thing for Sahaja yogis.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.901
And you see with your
vibrations if you have to take a decision,

01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:09.639
“Should I take this house or not?” Take the vibrations.

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.567
Anything you see,

01:09:12.659 --> 01:09:16.900
“What should I do? Should I have,
who should I have as a Prime Minister?”

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:19.944
Now, see for yourself whom do
you want to have a Prime Minister.

01:09:20.144 --> 01:09:24.510
See four people you put in; see the vibrations.
Who has the best? Now, you think of the person.

01:09:24.711 --> 01:09:29.067
He will not be the one the Prime
Minister. You cannot say that he will be

01:09:29.267 --> 01:09:31.865
because maybe that there are so many horrible people.

01:09:32.065 --> 01:09:37.290
In a democracy anybody can be brought in
but the one, who is a good one, is a Sahaja yogi.

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:39.501
He should be the Prime Minister, and you should ask.

01:09:39.701 --> 01:09:42.490
If the more people ask for it, he may be.

01:09:43.133 --> 01:09:47.408
So, decide everything with vibrations,
for yourself, for collectiveness or anything,

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:51.045
and the most important is you give it to others.

01:09:51.246 --> 01:09:54.233
And Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work in your houses, families,

01:09:54.433 --> 01:10:01.063
or in small little groups but it works here in Bhartiya
Vidya Bhavan when all of you are here because I’m here.

01:10:01.358 --> 01:10:06.400
It is a collective work. All of you are cells of one body,

01:10:06.853 --> 01:10:11.400
and the more cells are
awakened, the more the body is active.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.400
So, you have to come together, to be together.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.508
Love each other. Mix up with
others. Do not form groups, no.

01:10:18.708 --> 01:10:23.900
You should talk to each other very freely,
whatever is your language, nationality or whatever it is.

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:27.028
And you should mix up with others; is not proper,

01:10:27.228 --> 01:10:30.306
is a sense of insecurity is expressed if you have a group

01:10:30.506 --> 01:10:33.862
[Now we are bramhan so they all
Brahman will sit together -Marathi].

01:10:34.682 --> 01:10:36.914
This kind of a small thing is not there

01:10:37.114 --> 01:10:38.968
[Muslims sitting together in a group – Marathi]

01:10:40.256 --> 01:10:44.626
Foreigners are sitting together in a group like that.

01:10:44.827 --> 01:10:48.863
You see what I’m saying: there should be no grouping done; no need.

01:10:49.434 --> 01:10:52.233
Be open. All of us,

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:58.581
all of us are born of one Mother, we should
not feel insecure, we should be not together.

01:10:58.782 --> 01:11:01.733
It is not that you should
avoid also, if you are together all right,

01:11:01.933 --> 01:11:04.400
now together is all right we are all brothers and sisters.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.847
Be very friendly and kind and
do not analyze others and criticize others.

01:11:09.048 --> 01:11:12.765
Better to criticize yourself than to analyze others.

01:11:12.966 --> 01:11:15.947
Will sit down, “He’s like this because like that.”

01:11:16.148 --> 01:11:23.275
[He is like these & like that and what about
you? Pay attention towards yourself. - Marathi]

01:11:23.476 --> 01:11:28.027
We should watch ourselves and not others. Why
somebody is behaving like that, you just don’t worry.

01:11:28.228 --> 01:11:33.553
How are you behaving yourself? Are
you all right? Are your vibrations all right?

01:11:34.433 --> 01:11:37.841
And that’s how with love, patience, understanding,

01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:42.774
I’m sure one day we all will feel the
oneness, all of us, and we should help each other.

01:11:42.974 --> 01:11:45.358
If somebody is sick, we should help. Somebody tells you

01:11:45.558 --> 01:11:47.485
[If he told you that your heart
chakra is catching- Marathi] somebody.

01:11:47.685 --> 01:11:51.067
So, there is nothing to get angry.
Actually, it’s a great thing he has told you

01:11:51.267 --> 01:11:53.900
that he can cure you and you cannot see

01:11:54.679 --> 01:12:06.577
[In the past time this was a problem. If someone is saying that your heart chakra is not clear then he will say, How can you say that my heart chakra is catching ? It is obvious because this finger is burning – Marathi].

01:12:08.618 --> 01:12:11.852
So, it is a story

01:12:12.052 --> 01:12:15.639
told by a person who is not connected.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.677
So, you should not sort of identify with yourself.

01:12:18.877 --> 01:12:22.510
You should identify yourself with
the eternal life that is within you

01:12:22.710 --> 01:12:24.761
and you are going to enjoy it very much.

01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:29.567
So don’t feel insecure, don’t
have too many desires for something

01:12:29.861 --> 01:12:32.733
and you’ll be surprised that suddenly you’ll find

01:12:32.933 --> 01:12:36.385
[If it happened or not happens nothing matters – Marathi].

01:12:36.861 --> 01:12:41.908
If it works out, well and good; doesn’t work
out well and good, because we are there after all.

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:45.400
And if the car gets punctured,
all right, we are there after all.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.958
Even if the car is not there we are there. We are not lost.

01:12:49.307 --> 01:12:54.604
So don’t think of the future, don’t think of
the past but think of the present and enjoy.

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:57.400
That is the message of Sahaja Yoga,

01:12:58.732 --> 01:13:02.067
and perhaps I’ve covered most of the points for you people,

01:13:02.267 --> 01:13:06.900
and never try to criticize anyone, never, never, never.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:11.311
And be firm and know that you have just now crossed,

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:14.497
so many of you just crossed. So be steady, steadily

01:13:14.697 --> 01:13:17.733
[Look at front –Marathi] what is
going to happen, let us see. Let us see.

01:13:17.933 --> 01:13:20.992
Be with that. Suddenly, don’t be bumptious about it

01:13:21.192 --> 01:13:25.587
and otherwise you’ll be rippled back again,
you see. So gradually grope the whole thing.

01:13:25.787 --> 01:13:28.233
When you have got the mastery over it then grip it.

01:13:28.433 --> 01:13:30.898
But if you are bumptious, anybody can push you down

01:13:31.099 --> 01:13:33.636
saying that [It is not good –Marathi].

01:13:33.837 --> 01:13:35.900
There are many like that. So be careful.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.948
You see, everybody is trying to push you
down. In this world there are satanic forces,

01:13:40.148 --> 01:13:45.024
and you are very special chosen
people. That’s why you have got vibrations.

01:13:45.224 --> 01:13:48.067
There are so many people in
Bombay but how many have felt it?

01:13:48.267 --> 01:13:50.214
You are the very few who have felt it.

01:13:50.415 --> 01:13:54.457
So be careful about it and
meet together in this same number.

01:13:54.657 --> 01:14:00.900
All of you can be realized fully
if you come together and sit together.

01:14:01.244 --> 01:14:05.319
They say when Mataji is here, they are
here. Then Mataji is only busy all of the time.

01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:10.400
[That’s why I didn’t came to Mumbai this
time. Mataji is curing everyone’s catches – Marathi]

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:14.400
Those eight or ten people who
have been attending it regularly

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.900
are the best and they are also busy cleaning you

01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:31.692
[Don’t do like that. Put on one day Tuesday.
Today is the last day. I will come back – Marathi].

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:34.093
Today is the last day

01:14:34.918 --> 01:14:38.067
because I’m going on the 25th evening.

01:14:40.069 --> 01:14:44.786
I’ll be back again in December,
I hope so, for one or two days.

01:14:44.986 --> 01:14:47.567
We’ll have a program, not a long program

01:14:47.767 --> 01:14:50.229
because we are going on a holiday?

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:52.791
First time in My husband’s life.

01:14:52.991 --> 01:14:55.058
So, I hope you won’t mind.

01:14:55.356 --> 01:14:57.733
Then again I’ll come back next summer

01:14:57.933 --> 01:15:01.705
perhaps I don’t know maybe or maybe

01:15:02.268 --> 01:15:04.990
next year I may not come.

01:15:06.437 --> 01:15:12.206
By that time, I hope you people will keep to the program...
