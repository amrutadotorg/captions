00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:36.917
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:40.375
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:44.041
when you are all leaving this country,

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:51.333
and this kind of a special type of a puja

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.333
that we are having today.

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:58.959
This is the puja done to the sun,

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.583
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:11.375
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.333
Capricorn is Makar.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.000
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.542
towards the tropic of Cancer,

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:26.125
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.208
it has something to do with the sun.

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:31.333
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:34.500
because they have to deal with the sun.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.375
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.375
that they have put it on the fifteenth

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:41.125
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:46.417
Now today is, they are changing,

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:51.917
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:58.458
We've got six months when this moves,

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.834
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:06.458
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:10.333
from tomorrow.

00:05:10.583 --> 00:05:15.417
So today is the last day, which we say that

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.083
is the day which is the coldest day,

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:22.125
according to Indian understanding.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:25.417
After this the heat will start growing

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.333
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:35.208
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:37.542
during the summer-time.

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:40.041
Though it's very hot in summer,

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:43.875
still people wants the sun to rule us

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.792
and to give us warmth because,

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:51.917
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.709
all the fruits, everything grows.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:59.792
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.667
we call it as "Sankrant,"

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.959
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:06.834
That is when of course in the,

00:06:06.834 --> 00:06:12.709
in the European countries or say in England or America,

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:18.041
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:23.375
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:26.959
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:29.500
means the end of the calamity is over.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.583
And they give something sweet to eat

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:37.709
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.999
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:45.875
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:49.625
also want you to retain the heat

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:53.041
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:56.041
This is all thought of in a way,

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.375
in a very gross level,

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:58.834
on a very gross level,

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:02.375
that we should keep the people warm enough.

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:04.583
Also it is said that

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:10.917
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:14.125
for people, because it is the coldest day.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.959
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:21.041
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:22.917
- means "you say something sweet to us."

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.625
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:30.709
than the people who live in colder places,

00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.583
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.834
I don't blame them for their temperament,

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.583
because the nature is so unkind.

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:41.917
In India you can live anywhere:

00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:43.750
you can live under a tree,

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:46.917
you can live in a forest,

00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:49.166
anywhere you can live quite happily,

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:53.166
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:57.291
And there's not such a problem as

00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:00.208
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:02.333
where if you have to go out of the house

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.999
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:07.917
Here you just can walk out of the house,

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:10.917
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.750
and there's no problem of any kind

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:15.917
as far as the nature is concerned.

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:20.625
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:25.458
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.750
people feel very happy during that time,

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:37.792
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:43.583
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

00:08:43.999 --> 00:08:45.166
Because of that,

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:47.083
people keep more to their houses,

00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.667
to artificial heating or other heatings,

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:52.000
and the doors are closed,

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:53.917
the hearts are closed,

00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:57.999
and it's difficult for them to

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:02.000
communicate with other people.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:07.333
As you go down south more in your countries also,

00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:09.583
you'll find people are warmer,

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:11.792
simpler,

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:17.667
very hospitable.

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:23.041
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:27.041
and a kind of a inviting heart.

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:30.750
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:33.333
the sun line is the right side

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:36.834
and the moon, moon is the left side.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.999
On the moon line

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.542
one can desire but cannot act.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.792
Apart from that, on the moon line

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.750
if you go too far it can be destructive.

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:51.875
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:56.917
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:01.750
no work - then you start thinking too much,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:07.417
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:08.875
no action.

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:10.875
And without the action

00:10:10.875 --> 00:10:13.458
this energy can become very destructive.

00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:16.417
That is why we find that people,

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:18.417
they say that "empty mind,

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:24.417
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.625
Where people have, do not act,

00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.291
when the action doesn't take place,

00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:32.667
then it can be quite destructive...

00:10:40.917 --> 00:10:45.166
So the whole situation is different

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:46.875
in a country which is warm,

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:49.208
and a country which is not warm.

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:53.417
But in a country where it is very warm also,

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:54.792
like Africa,

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:58.208
there are complications due to too much of heat.

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:04.333
Like we have the tropic of -

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:07.625
mean the equator passing through,

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.750
and it heats up that area so much

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.041
that it becomes full of jungles,

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.999
very high trees and tall trees;

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:21.999
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.417
that there's no possibility

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:30.750
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:33.625
and it's quite dark,

00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:35.291
it's full of darkness.

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:39.709
So that extreme also comes in the same category

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:42.500
as the extreme of the cold season.

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:44.709
Now such people live there

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:49.458
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.750
so they do not grow much;

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.834
and they can be primitive people

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:57.375
and they can be quite aggressive,

00:11:57.375 --> 00:12:00.125
like they learn things from the animals

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.959
and they could be quite aggressive.

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:06.041
So the balance has to be struck,

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:08.291
and the balance is that,

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:15.750
that we should desire and act.

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:21.458
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.959
there is a division of labor, I think,

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:30.250
that one part of the country is thinking,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.000
another part of the country is acting.

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:37.834
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.375
So a balance has to be struck where

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:45.917
you have the Sushumna working out.

00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:49.375
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:53.750
one would say is the equator - it's not,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.125
is not the equator,

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:58.834
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:02.166
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

00:13:02.458 --> 00:13:04.166
and that has to act;

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:07.250
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:13.166
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:17.875
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.750
like a big pole

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.875
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:27.083
There is nothing that is material

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:30.458
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:32.083
but it's the energy force

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.667
which acts in such a manner

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:39.417
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:42.750
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:47.208
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:50.792
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

00:13:50.792 --> 00:13:52.458
to give us a balance.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.999
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

00:13:57.208 --> 00:14:03.542
that half of the countries get the sun

00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:05.458
during the summer-time,

00:14:05.458 --> 00:14:09.875
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:13.750
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:14.917
Apart from that,

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:19.667
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:24.291
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:29.000
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:35.083
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:39.917
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:42.000
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:46.458
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:51.542
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:53.458
and all that takes place.

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:56.208
This axis is the one which moves.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:59.291
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:04.166
moves the lava into different directions

00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:12.208
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.041
and also to have

00:15:19.834 --> 00:15:22.709
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

00:15:23.041 --> 00:15:28.709
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

00:15:28.709 --> 00:15:29.959
what is to be done.

00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:33.041
This axis is the one that loves us.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.500
Because of this axis we,

00:15:36.834 --> 00:15:38.709
we have seasons.

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:42.375
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:45.458
different, different varieties of food

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:47.959
and varieties of things.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.959
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:56.500
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.166
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.041
and we'll have no food, nothing,

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:07.000
and it will be like moon living here.

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:10.166
Now it has been specially created:

00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:14.125
first the Mother Earth when it was created

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:17.041
through the heat of the sun,

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:21.834
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.041
Then she was brought very close to the moon

00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:29.125
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:30.709
it was all snow.

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:34.625
Then it was brought closer to the sun

00:16:34.917 --> 00:16:37.500
and moved at a point where

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.250
life could start working,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.709
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.917
to make life grow in that area.

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:49.125
Now when the life started growing,

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:53.834
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:57.417
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

00:16:57.417 --> 00:16:59.625
because there's heat in the axis,

00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:02.750
the energy of heat that converts

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:10.999
the plants into carbon.

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:13.875
Now this carbon is, later on

00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:16.709
forms the basis for,

00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:19.417
we can say,

00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:25.999
for the production of carbohydrates,

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:27.250
you can say,

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.834
or all organic matter.

00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:34.166
But to create life we had to have another help,

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.750
is the nitrogen;

00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:39.291
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:43.417
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

00:17:43.834 --> 00:17:46.291
And when it created this nitrogen,

00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:49.000
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:52.709
and when the amino acids were created within us,

00:17:53.125 --> 00:18:00.041
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:04.542
Of course this was done in the ocean,

00:18:04.834 --> 00:18:07.583
because in the ocean with the movement,

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:10.999
nitrogen was created and life was created,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.166
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

00:18:14.417 --> 00:18:17.417
and that's how we have amino acids.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:21.125
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.125
gave us the combinations and permutations,

00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:25.417
different lives.

00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:28.709
So in the whole evolutionary process

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:32.709
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:35.166
In the same way in human beings,

00:18:35.417 --> 00:18:38.291
the axis is the most important thing.

00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:42.750
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:45.417
We have to stand on our axis.

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.250
Those who do not stand on their axis,

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:51.625
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:56.166
are capable of complete destruction;

00:18:56.583 --> 00:18:59.291
because either they will be destroyed by

00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:03.041
too much of right side or too much of left side.

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:07.875
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

00:19:08.166 --> 00:19:11.125
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:14.500
can have problems of different chakras,

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:20.250
of different kind of quality in a person.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.458
A person who stretches his axis too much,

00:19:24.458 --> 00:19:26.500
puts back his head like this,

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.750
is a person who is very right-sided

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.458
and creates problem with his ego;

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:33.834
and the one who absolutely bends down

00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:38.750
like a slavish person also is a person

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.291
who goes towards his destructiveness.

00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:46.166
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.500
one trying to dominate another,

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.750
and when they start dominating another person

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.875
they actually destroy themselves,

00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:57.917
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

00:19:57.917 --> 00:19:59.250
For example now,

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.750
we have seen that we had

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.834
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

00:20:07.041 --> 00:20:10.375
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.208
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:13.458
some other people.

00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:16.375
But everything that they did to dominate

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:18.458
and all that has double reactions.

00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:21.041
First of all by their domination, say,

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:23.125
Indians became very slavish,

00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:26.709
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.583
and they do not have that independent axis

00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:30.834
as they should have.

00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:33.125
Extremely slavish people they are.

00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:35.333
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:37.625
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:39.709
I find they are so very slavish.

00:20:39.709 --> 00:20:44.166
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

00:20:44.166 --> 00:20:46.917
to please the white-skinned people.

00:20:48.041 --> 00:20:53.000
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.375
That added to the ego of the whites,

00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:00.709
added to the ego of the whites,

00:21:00.709 --> 00:21:02.917
and today you see what's happening is

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:05.000
all that ego is destroying them.

00:21:05.458 --> 00:21:08.458
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

00:21:08.709 --> 00:21:12.041
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:15.625
One has to understand that what is the best

00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:18.000
within a human being is his axis,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.959
and everybody has an axis,

00:21:20.166 --> 00:21:23.625
and one must respect the axis of every person.

00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:28.000
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.709
I know you by your chakras,

00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:31.959
by your Sushumna,

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:33.583
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:36.959
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:39.375
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:42.792
I know you as a person with a very superficial

00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:45.000
type of a Sushumna.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.458
And even if you make up something

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:52.917
by sort of being very nice or good,

00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:55.125
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:57.375
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:57.375 --> 00:22:01.583
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:03.959
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:06.000
I know how deep you are.

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:09.041
So the depth on the axis

00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:11.375
is more important than anything else.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:15.125
Your axis has to be very deep.

00:22:15.291 --> 00:22:16.875
Now you will say that "Mother,

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:21.166
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

00:22:21.458 --> 00:22:25.625
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:31.375
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

00:22:32.041 --> 00:22:35.500
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.000
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:43.375
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:48.375
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:52.458
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

00:22:52.709 --> 00:22:54.166
and all the rest of them

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:59.125
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:02.041
while the people who are not deep, their outside

00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:08.166
what you call the foldings are bigger

00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:11.041
than the inside small thing.

00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:14.959
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:17.834
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:20.000
may look to be very good-looking

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.250
or whatever it may be outwardly,

00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:25.625
but inwardly they are not deep.

00:23:26.041 --> 00:23:28.000
Inwardly if they are deep,

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.875
their whole attitude is beautiful.

00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:34.166
They are very joy-giving people,

00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:36.291
they are very joy-giving.

00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:41.000
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:44.458
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:47.834
but the joy won't be really that deep;

00:23:48.041 --> 00:23:50.583
it would be like a joy-killing.

00:23:52.583 --> 00:23:57.000
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

00:23:57.458 --> 00:24:01.834
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

00:24:02.041 --> 00:24:06.500
the proper effort we have to put in.

00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:12.166
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:17.834
and some people have very, very what you should say,

00:24:18.125 --> 00:24:22.834
a very constricted type of the axis.

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.500
This axis has to be grown.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.875
Now when you come for My puja and all that

00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:29.750
I do expand it, I agree,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.500
but it is temporary thing.

00:24:33.834 --> 00:24:38.583
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

00:24:38.834 --> 00:24:40.834
in the collective also.

00:24:40.834 --> 00:24:46.041
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.041
But it should be done seriously.

00:24:49.291 --> 00:24:51.250
It should not be just a joke,

00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:52.834
to be frivolous,

00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:55.500
to be stupid - that's not the way.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.375
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:02.166
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:05.375
it's a meditative thing;

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.625
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.625
it's a puja to God.

00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:15.000
Is to be done with that reverence,

00:25:15.583 --> 00:25:22.250
because reverence is the key of achievement.

00:25:23.458 --> 00:25:26.500
If you have no reverence about yourself

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.291
and no reverence of others,

00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:30.250
then it cannot be done.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.750
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.583
"What am I doing with my life?

00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:36.875
Where am I wasting it?

00:25:36.875 --> 00:25:38.000
Why should I waste it?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.166
Why shouldn't I be deep?

00:25:40.166 --> 00:25:42.250
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.000
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:48.792
All these things if they pop into your head,

00:25:48.792 --> 00:25:52.792
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.208
because normally on small, small things people fight.

00:25:56.208 --> 00:26:00.375
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

00:26:00.375 --> 00:26:04.125
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:08.083
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

00:26:08.083 --> 00:26:11.000
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

00:26:11.375 --> 00:26:14.792
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.959
even if he doesn't show off much,

00:26:18.208 --> 00:26:20.792
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:23.667
he expresses himself through his depth,

00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:26.583
because I can work out better through that.

00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:31.000
So to develop this one must meditate,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
important thing is to meditate;

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.750
every day, every day, every day.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.750
You may not eat your food one day,

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.250
you may not sleep one day,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.291
you may not go to your office one day,

00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:45.458
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

00:26:45.458 --> 00:26:47.625
- but you must meditate every day.

00:26:47.625 --> 00:26:49.250
That's an important point,

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.959
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:04.250
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:06.917
the first thing you will notice about yourself

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:10.000
that you do not care for any comfort,

00:27:10.959 --> 00:27:13.375
you're not bothered about any,

00:27:15.542 --> 00:27:17.417
any material thing.

00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:20.166
Whatever it is you are above it,

00:27:20.166 --> 00:27:22.417
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:25.041
You just don't want to put your neck

00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:28.291
into a thing where you do not belong.

00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:30.125
You just get out of it,

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:31.667
and you think that

00:27:32.417 --> 00:27:35.917
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:39.458
So your whole attention now moves inward.

00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:41.875
When the attention starts moving inward

00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:43.875
then it expands more.

00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:47.333
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:52.208
and starts expanding and expanding.

00:27:52.792 --> 00:27:55.000
Now in small, small things also:

00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:56.917
say for example

00:27:57.834 --> 00:28:01.041
if I have not mentioned somebody

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:03.959
and mentioned somebody else,

00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:06.500
then they feel,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.875
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

00:28:08.875 --> 00:28:12.500
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.709
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

00:28:17.709 --> 00:28:21.041
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:23.667
But these outward things are,

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.917
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

00:28:25.917 --> 00:28:28.250
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.500
didn't do that."

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.000
All those things if it comes to your head,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.834
that means absolutely it's true

00:28:35.083 --> 00:28:38.500
that there is something lacking in you.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.083
Or if you try to complain,

00:28:41.083 --> 00:28:43.792
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

00:28:43.792 --> 00:28:45.792
and I had to stand on this thing,"

00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:48.458
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

00:28:50.792 --> 00:28:53.250
This widening comforts you.

00:28:53.709 --> 00:28:55.917
That's the comforting thing,

00:28:56.333 --> 00:28:59.458
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:04.917
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:11.125
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

00:29:13.834 --> 00:29:16.333
And this one has to develop,

00:29:16.583 --> 00:29:18.333
through meditative effort.

00:29:18.709 --> 00:29:22.542
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

00:29:22.542 --> 00:29:25.125
as it is today is a collective happening.

00:29:25.959 --> 00:29:28.834
I find especially among Indian men,

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:31.041
they never do any work with their hands,

00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:32.458
which is a wrong thing.

00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:35.250
Because they don't use their hands at all

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.500
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.834
Indians have the worst collectivity.

00:29:40.709 --> 00:29:42.000
If you have an ashram,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.667
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:45.333
nobody is going to stay there.

00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:48.667
They want to have their own houses,

00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:49.999
their own families,

00:29:49.999 --> 00:29:51.583
their own children;

00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:54.333
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:58.333
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:02.792
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.542
- leave alone repairing anything.

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:09.667
They will stand with their hands on their hips

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:13.667
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.583
There's a Marathi saying,

00:30:15.834 --> 00:30:18.375
a very interesting ....

00:30:18.959 --> 00:30:25.959
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

00:30:27.709 --> 00:30:30.041
So that is very typical of Indian men.

00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:31.709
They cannot repair anything,

00:30:31.709 --> 00:30:33.250
they cannot do anything.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.834
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:37.375
they'll just stand like this, watch,

00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:39.375
they'll never put their hands to it.

00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:42.625
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

00:30:42.625 --> 00:30:45.166
what we call as shramadaan.

00:30:46.625 --> 00:30:48.834
They have to do some shramadaan.

00:30:49.041 --> 00:30:52.875
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

00:30:54.834 --> 00:30:57.375
and that is what we lack.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.999
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:05.166
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

00:31:05.166 --> 00:31:07.625
try to put some garden around your house,

00:31:07.875 --> 00:31:09.417
try to paint your house,

00:31:09.417 --> 00:31:11.875
do some sort of a work with your hand

00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:15.041
which even if you don't have anything,

00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:19.166
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:23.625
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

00:31:23.625 --> 00:31:25.750
because I don't think people even do that.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.875
Even they don't shave themselves,

00:31:27.875 --> 00:31:30.375
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:33.291
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:36.291
Now, but on the contrary

00:31:36.291 --> 00:31:39.250
we see in the West people use their hands.

00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:41.750
Because of that, you see,

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:44.500
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

00:31:44.792 --> 00:31:47.750
So they score a point on being collective,

00:31:48.083 --> 00:31:49.875
while the Indians score a point because

00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:51.792
they are Indians and they have a heritage

00:31:51.792 --> 00:31:52.999
and they know what is Kundalini,

00:31:52.999 --> 00:31:55.333
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.542
So they score a point this side.

00:31:57.542 --> 00:31:59.458
So it's the left side is the desire,

00:31:59.458 --> 00:32:00.999
the right side is the action;

00:32:00.999 --> 00:32:03.875
again we come back to the same position where

00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:05.291
we have an imbalance,

00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:07.667
that the action takes place in the West,

00:32:07.999 --> 00:32:12.583
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:15.458
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:19.083
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:21.750
Now we are building one single ashram

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.417
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

00:32:27.792 --> 00:32:30.834
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

00:32:34.709 --> 00:32:37.500
And it's so difficult, you see,

00:32:37.917 --> 00:32:40.041
to understand why they have taken so much time

00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.500
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:46.709
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.834
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

00:32:50.208 --> 00:32:52.500
everything is to be done tomorrow.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.834
"This we will do tomorrow."

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:56.834
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

00:32:57.041 --> 00:33:01.500
Like we used to have in the school,

00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:07.792
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

00:33:07.792 --> 00:33:11.000
see, there were: one house was built,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.250
three persons came to work and one ran away.

00:33:14.709 --> 00:33:18.458
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:19.792
and two ran away;

00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:24.041
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:26.667
So how, when will the house be finished?

00:33:26.917 --> 00:33:28.500
Never!

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:34.333
With such runaways it can never be finished.

00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:35.500
It's like that.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.667
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:41.375
I was saying that all Indians must find out

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:45.583
some place where they could go and plant something.

00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:48.083
Get hold of some sort of a place

00:33:48.375 --> 00:33:52.208
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:55.458
water it together, work it out together.

00:33:55.792 --> 00:33:58.000
Now the Indian women are that way better.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.041
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:02.458
and all that,

00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:04.500
but the other part is missing.

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.709
The other part is intelligence,

00:34:06.959 --> 00:34:08.959
it's the other part is to think.

00:34:08.959 --> 00:34:11.583
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:14.792
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

00:34:14.792 --> 00:34:19.000
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.375
a lemon with his food.

00:34:20.375 --> 00:34:21.792
Now there's no lemon in the house.

00:34:21.792 --> 00:34:24.041
This woman would run up and down all over the place

00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:25.917
to get the lemon for the husband,

00:34:25.917 --> 00:34:27.792
otherwise he will not eat the food.

00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:28.500
Doesn't matter,

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.375
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

00:34:34.458 --> 00:34:35.834
But the women will try,

00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:38.041
because you see they must keep their,

00:34:38.333 --> 00:34:39.500
they understand one thing

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.333
that you must keep their palate all right.

00:34:41.333 --> 00:34:43.792
Then they are quite sensible in India

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.999
because here they're real tigers,

00:34:45.999 --> 00:34:47.792
all the husbands are like tigers,

00:34:47.792 --> 00:34:50.083
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

00:34:50.083 --> 00:34:52.709
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

00:34:53.583 --> 00:34:56.458
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

00:34:56.458 --> 00:34:57.917
the husbands are like,

00:34:57.917 --> 00:35:01.208
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

00:35:08.875 --> 00:35:11.709
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:13.542
and when they go to West,

00:35:13.542 --> 00:35:16.792
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.875
Something surprising how they change immediately

00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:22.667
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:23.917
and all those things,

00:35:23.917 --> 00:35:25.542
but they become like that.

00:35:25.792 --> 00:35:29.250
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.208
when he doesn't understand

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:33.542
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

00:35:33.542 --> 00:35:37.291
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:42.125
This balance comes through our depth,

00:35:42.125 --> 00:35:44.333
and that depth has to be improved.

00:35:44.959 --> 00:35:49.875
Not through just by talking about it,

00:35:50.166 --> 00:35:52.041
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:52.041 --> 00:35:55.417
but actually seriously doing meditation,

00:35:55.417 --> 00:35:58.166
actually seriously doing meditation.

00:36:02.125 --> 00:36:05.291
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

00:36:05.709 --> 00:36:08.542
Now we have in India, say, architects.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.166
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

00:36:12.166 --> 00:36:16.291
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.500
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.166
And now they have problems, practical problems,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.667
they cannot nail one nail.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.709
All are what you call them as white-collar...

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.208
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

00:36:32.542 --> 00:36:35.000
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:37.999
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.250
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

00:36:42.208 --> 00:36:45.750
So under these circumstances one has to understand

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.208
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:53.333
as far as collectivity is concerned,

00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:55.000
so let us be collective.

00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:57.583
Let us try to do something collective.

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:01.000
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.417
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

00:37:07.583 --> 00:37:09.583
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

00:37:09.583 --> 00:37:11.083
to their children nicely;

00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:15.417
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

00:37:18.792 --> 00:37:21.792
Now the other side is that the Western people

00:37:21.792 --> 00:37:24.333
care so much for collectivity that

00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:26.667
whatever it is they try to compromise,

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:29.750
and try to keep the family life all right.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.542
So it's the two extremes as we have.

00:37:33.917 --> 00:37:37.917
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

00:37:38.208 --> 00:37:39.999
the family life is going strong.

00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:44.291
But if you see such men in England,

00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:47.125
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:49.875
that Indian men do to their women here.

00:37:49.875 --> 00:37:55.750
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

00:37:56.083 --> 00:37:59.291
So the balance between the women and men:

00:37:59.583 --> 00:38:01.709
what is the axis, is the home.

00:38:02.917 --> 00:38:04.250
Home is the axis.

00:38:04.542 --> 00:38:07.333
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:09.083
What do you think about,

00:38:09.083 --> 00:38:10.583
what is your problem?

00:38:10.875 --> 00:38:12.458
Where is your attention,

00:38:12.792 --> 00:38:14.250
what do you discuss?

00:38:14.999 --> 00:38:16.792
That's very important to see.

00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:18.875
In that you'll find out

00:38:19.083 --> 00:38:21.083
what is going on in the family.

00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:23.750
Say you are talking ill of each other,

00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:27.458
if you are telling your child against your husband,

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.750
husband is telling the wife against,

00:38:30.083 --> 00:38:33.333
telling the children about, against the,

00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:38.125
against the husband, like that.

00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:39.834
If it is going on like that,

00:38:40.041 --> 00:38:41.125
then what happens,

00:38:41.125 --> 00:38:44.625
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:46.834
The axis is love,

00:38:47.917 --> 00:38:49.250
axis is love,

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.959
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:57.041
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.000
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:08.000
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.208
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

00:39:12.458 --> 00:39:16.792
If people get realization before they are developed,

00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:20.834
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

00:39:21.417 --> 00:39:23.166
We don't have to become communist,

00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:24.834
we don't have to do anything like that,

00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:26.999
because communists are just the same as Americans,

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:29.750
there's no difference at all in temperament.

00:39:30.625 --> 00:39:34.166
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:36.375
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:38.041
and if a Russian is sent to America

00:39:38.041 --> 00:39:40.750
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.166
There's no change at all.

00:39:43.166 --> 00:39:48.750
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

00:39:50.417 --> 00:39:54.041
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

00:39:55.417 --> 00:39:59.999
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.291
then any amount of development,

00:40:02.542 --> 00:40:04.542
any amount of all these things

00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:08.625
cannot destroy that country,

00:40:08.625 --> 00:40:10.250
cannot create wars.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.166
There will be peace everywhere,

00:40:12.166 --> 00:40:14.166
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

00:40:14.166 --> 00:40:16.834
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:19.750
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

00:40:19.999 --> 00:40:23.166
and we have to look forward to the new age

00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:30.750
of a new moon blessing us,

00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:34.041
and the great sun coming over

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:37.542
to give us all the energy we need,

00:40:38.291 --> 00:40:43.875
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:45.999
May God bless you all.

00:40:54.458 --> 00:40:55.667
Now for the puja,

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:57.709
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:01.542
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:31.458
From the foreign country,

00:42:31.458 --> 00:42:35.291
who is going to stay after the

00:42:39.083 --> 00:42:45.458
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:52.375
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

00:42:53.458 --> 00:42:58.333
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.625
All right, let's put it,

00:43:00.625 --> 00:43:04.709
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:14.917
When are these people going?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.375
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

00:43:18.959 --> 00:43:22.333
when are they going, when are you going?

00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:28.000
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:31.000
What about you, John?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.166
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

00:43:55.959 --> 00:43:57.959
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

00:43:57.959 --> 00:44:02.333
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:05.250
like that, in the near future,

00:44:06.583 --> 00:44:09.458
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:22.125
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:33.041
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

00:44:33.375 --> 00:44:36.375
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:39.625
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

00:44:40.166 --> 00:44:41.709
It's not meant for ladies at all,

00:44:41.709 --> 00:44:44.125
and I have only one room where I live.

00:44:44.125 --> 00:44:47.125
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

00:44:55.458 --> 00:44:57.250
Let them go to Alibagh,

00:44:57.625 --> 00:45:00.583
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:04.792
to people who will be looking after them.

00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:07.125
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:10.917
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.834
Fifty, all right.

00:45:14.709 --> 00:45:18.333
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:25.458
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

00:45:25.917 --> 00:45:27.041
You can come to Pratishthan

00:45:27.041 --> 00:45:29.041
if you want to take some photographs or things,

00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:31.625
but it's a liability for us because,

00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:33.959
you see, unless and until you go back,

00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:36.458
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.583
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

00:45:38.834 --> 00:45:41.166
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:43.792
And then you'd better book yourself,

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.583
because this must go out of our country,

00:45:46.917 --> 00:45:48.709
otherwise they're always on our head,

00:45:50.458 --> 00:45:52.000
and they are following us.

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:55.333
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

00:45:55.875 --> 00:45:57.625
stuff that you are carrying.

00:45:57.999 --> 00:46:00.750
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.750
You can finish the photography there,

00:46:04.999 --> 00:46:06.458
and you fix up your going.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.667
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:14.542
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

00:46:14.999 --> 00:46:16.333
Alibagh is better...

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:22.792
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.125
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.959
All right, so done.

00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:42.208
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

00:46:44.458 --> 00:46:46.792
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

00:46:46.792 --> 00:46:49.333
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

00:46:49.709 --> 00:46:51.583
and they can leave.
