1
00:03:42,303 --> 00:03:48,837
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

2
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:56,177
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

3
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:00,557
We can say this is the worship

4
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:04,647
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

5
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:14,577
If you understand that all this,

6
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:21,607
whatever is created on this universe,

7
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:29,057
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

8
00:04:29,497 --> 00:04:33,187
Now many people believe that there is one God.

9
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:38,397
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

10
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:46,947
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

11
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:54,257
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

12
00:04:54,617 --> 00:05:02,447
So, first of all, He did was to create

13
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:06,217
the power of Adi Shakti.

14
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:12,757
When It was created then there was a sound,

15
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:16,817
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

16
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,237
by the primordial sound,

17
00:05:19,437 --> 00:05:23,497
and these three powers came out of that sound -

18
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:29,217
is A, U and M -Aum.

19
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:34,037
The Adi Shakti is the One

20
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:41,517
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

21
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:49,217
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

22
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:55,977
and for His own expression,

23
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:59,497
for His own manifestation,

24
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:03,817
for His own reflection.

25
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:09,717
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

26
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:14,817
so He must have thought of creating a partner

27
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:20,487
who will manifest His desires.

28
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:30,497
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

29
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:37,007
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

30
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:42,487
His desire to create.

31
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:47,227
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

32
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:51,867
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

33
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:55,897
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

34
00:06:56,097 --> 00:07:02,087
The attention has its own joy

35
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:06,897
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

36
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:10,257
She created all the universes,

37
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:15,167
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

38
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:20,857
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

39
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:24,617
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

40
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:31,207
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

41
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,337
At this juncture one may ask that,

42
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:40,707
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

43
00:07:41,257 --> 00:07:44,117
That was the idea of God Almighty,

44
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:51,027
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

45
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:57,507
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

46
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,517
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

47
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:04,677
She had Her own way of expression,

48
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:08,607
that She thought She must create the mirrors

49
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:14,247
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

50
00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:16,097
to see His character

51
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:22,067
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

52
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,667
This evolution had to work out this way

53
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:34,497
because they had to know from where they come.

54
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:40,927
We must know that we come from nature.

55
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:46,827
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

56
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:51,887
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

57
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:57,947
And She too is not just a dead earth,

58
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:02,687
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

59
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:08,507
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

60
00:09:08,707 --> 00:09:15,697
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

61
00:09:15,897 --> 00:09:21,637
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

62
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:26,477
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

63
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:30,877
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

64
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:35,017
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

65
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:37,597
See the whole plan that was made.

66
00:09:37,797 --> 00:09:43,227
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

67
00:09:43,437 --> 00:09:48,187
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

68
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,377
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

69
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:53,897
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

70
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,617
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

71
00:09:57,817 --> 00:10:03,707
This is the power that does all the living work,

72
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:09,927
all the organization, all the creation.

73
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:19,757
In our human ego we start thinking that

74
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:23,807
we do something, we can create.

75
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:30,307
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

76
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,887
leave alone anything else.

77
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,157
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

78
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:43,857
we can put together and create something,

79
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:53,437
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

80
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:58,517
any power.

81
00:10:58,717 --> 00:11:01,757
We cannot create anything.

82
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:09,727
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

83
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:15,337
For example, something is made of gold.

84
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:18,667
Still it is gold.

85
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:22,007
Now something is made of wood,

86
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:26,607
whatever it is made, is wood.

87
00:11:26,807 --> 00:11:30,377
The principle is the same into everything.

88
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:35,297
So whatever may be your birth,

89
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:38,377
whatever may be the country you are born,

90
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:45,117
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

91
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:48,937
basically you all are the same.

92
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:54,577
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

93
00:11:54,777 --> 00:11:58,987
also, you cry the same way.

94
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,857
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

95
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:07,717
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

96
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:13,847
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

97
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:18,707
by some common principle of life.

98
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:24,317
And the common principle of life that has bound us

99
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:31,367
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

100
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,277
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

101
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,727
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

102
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:41,067
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

103
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:50,347
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

104
00:12:50,547 --> 00:12:53,827
But in the human form only

105
00:12:54,027 --> 00:13:00,967
it has evolved as a connection,

106
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:06,557
as one that is the divine force within us,

107
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:12,057
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

108
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:18,207
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

109
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:21,767
This is the common principle we all have.

110
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:29,267
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

111
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:34,447
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

112
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:41,577
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

113
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,727
Then there are people, as you people are,

114
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:49,737
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

115
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:52,907
who have got your realization.

116
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:57,327
So when you understand that this is the

117
00:13:57,527 --> 00:14:04,467
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

118
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,247
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

119
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,137
and the enjoyment.

120
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:20,077
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

121
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:23,837
what should happen to you?

122
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:28,487
What should we feel?

123
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:34,777
How do we then exist?

124
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:40,787
This is the question many a times you have asked.

125
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,647
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

126
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,277
that you are not there,

127
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:50,407
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

128
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,577
Secondly, what happens to you

129
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:57,497
is that you become just the existence.

130
00:14:57,697 --> 00:15:00,457
Just the existence.

131
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:03,207
And that existence that you become,

132
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:08,767
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

133
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:14,387
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

134
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:16,427
also much before.

135
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:19,137
In every religion we have had people

136
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:23,807
who had this divine character very well developed.

137
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:29,157
For example, even you can say,

138
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:36,327
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

139
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:43,397
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

140
00:15:43,597 --> 00:15:46,067
and a khumba also,

141
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:49,147
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

142
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:55,947
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

143
00:15:56,147 --> 00:16:00,757
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

144
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:05,897
You know that there is this power within us.

145
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:11,467
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

146
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:17,107
from the middle path of our ascent.

147
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,937
Here also the same Kundalini,

148
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:25,343
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

149
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:32,217
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

150
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:37,227
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

151
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:41,717
So now when we are enlightened people,

152
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:47,097
we have become saints and we are above all others,

153
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:54,367
what should we do is to understand fully well -

154
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:57,677
not only mentally, but from your heart -

155
00:16:57,877 --> 00:17:03,987
that now you have got these divine vibrations

156
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:09,277
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

157
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:14,717
what are you, where is the problem.

158
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,837
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

159
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,567
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

160
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:26,137
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

161
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,717
with spiritual vibrations."

162
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,327
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

163
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,487
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

164
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,877
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

165
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:43,117
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

166
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:45,227
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

167
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:47,317
from here only there are vibrations,

168
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,887
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

169
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,457
So then he sat down and started wondering,

170
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:57,707
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

171
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:03,617
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

172
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,647
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

173
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:11,757
and that's how he found the place.

174
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,427
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

175
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,537
is not done haphazard, in any way.

176
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:20,907
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

177
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:27,237
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

178
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:33,257
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

179
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,007
We are the ones which spoil the nature

180
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:40,507
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

181
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,807
and we have to respect it.

182
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,097
I've already told you many a times

183
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:48,187
about how human beings were formed

184
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:55,337
by different chemicals who came also,

185
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,597
carbon came from the mother earth.

186
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:02,037
All this leads us to understand

187
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:06,887
that we have a very big responsibility.

188
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:13,437
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

189
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:16,347
And now you all have reached a state

190
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:20,487
where you have become yourself.

191
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:22,837
You know yourself.

192
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,087
This is a very big, I think should say,

193
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:34,597
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

194
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:43,717
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

195
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:18,597
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

196
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:25,917
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

197
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:35,797
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

198
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:42,287
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

199
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:46,217
and these centers have to be awakened

200
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,917
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

201
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:57,897
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

202
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:07,687
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

203
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:12,617
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

204
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:18,747
from the path of your perfection.

205
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:23,287
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

206
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:27,997
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

207
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:32,117
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

208
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:36,937
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

209
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:41,897
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

210
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:45,987
There are so many ways of people relating

211
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:49,847
to the power of the Divine.

212
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:54,337
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

213
00:21:54,537 --> 00:22:00,007
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

214
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:03,387
and through Her the whole universe was created.

215
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:11,327
But also true that as you are seeking,

216
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:14,777
also the Divine is seeking you.

217
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:23,327
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

218
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:31,087
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

219
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:37,047
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

220
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:41,217
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

221
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:44,387
It is the One which has given you

222
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:47,567
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

223
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:52,117
"Whatever we have is given by You".

224
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:56,827
If that is the case that all that you have

225
00:22:57,027 --> 00:23:01,477
is given by your Kundalini,

226
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:05,377
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

227
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:10,337
then is very important to understand what is the need

228
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:18,207
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

229
00:23:19,657 --> 00:23:27,177
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

230
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,787
As I said, there's a relationship

231
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:38,517
between the realized souls and the Divine.

232
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,577
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

233
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:48,447
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

234
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:52,087
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

235
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,137
It's such a relationship.

236
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:58,467
And it's so close, it's so close,

237
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:03,927
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

238
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:11,027
or the moon has its own moonlight.

239
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:22,457
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

240
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:27,877
and that should give you full control over yourself

241
00:24:28,077 --> 00:24:33,417
and over your development.

242
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:41,467
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

243
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:46,087
Now

244
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:56,817
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

245
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,747
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

246
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,347
you may.

247
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,487
But as soon as that person will disappear,

248
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,787
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

249
00:25:06,987 --> 00:25:10,257
That surrender has no meaning.

250
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:16,687
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

251
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:20,817
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

252
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:24,607
because it has a reaction.

253
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:32,827
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

254
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:48,927
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

255
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:54,827
into the water automatically,

256
00:25:55,027 --> 00:26:02,767
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

257
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:07,807
If you can just feel that within yourself,

258
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:11,197
that you are one with the Divine.

259
00:26:11,397 --> 00:26:16,487
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

260
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:26,857
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

261
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:33,457
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

262
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:40,637
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

263
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:46,617
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

264
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:50,657
There's a great joy in forgiving,

265
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:55,377
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

266
00:26:55,577 --> 00:27:01,877
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

267
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,987
Nobody can disturb you.

268
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:10,637
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

269
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:13,077
that is what is forgiveness.

270
00:27:13,277 --> 00:27:17,797
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

271
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:20,737
or to do something against somebody.

272
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:24,927
The Divine takes over from you

273
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:28,027
and does whatever is needed,

274
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:34,897
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

275
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:40,457
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

276
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,897
say in Islam called ruh;

277
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:47,877
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

278
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:52,257
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

279
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:58,217
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

280
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:03,017
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

281
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,777
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

282
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:12,537
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

283
00:28:12,737 --> 00:28:17,697
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

284
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:20,237
how to make others feel it.

285
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:23,927
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

286
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,177
or something nonsensical.

287
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:30,157
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

288
00:28:30,357 --> 00:28:36,277
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

289
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:42,317
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

290
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:46,597
that you know there is this Power.

291
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:49,147
You're sure about this Power

292
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:53,527
because you can feel it within yourself.

293
00:28:53,727 --> 00:28:56,667
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

294
00:28:56,877 --> 00:29:03,047
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

295
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:08,857
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

296
00:29:09,057 --> 00:29:18,387
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

297
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:21,827
She tells you the truth.

298
00:29:23,877 --> 00:29:28,867
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

299
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:33,707
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

300
00:29:33,907 --> 00:29:37,667
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

301
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:43,097
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

302
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:45,647
This kind of argument is possible.

303
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:48,567
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

304
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:51,437
that you forgive that person,

305
00:29:51,637 --> 00:29:56,227
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

306
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,247
you don't do anything.

307
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:00,927
That's the truth.

308
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:05,677
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

309
00:30:05,877 --> 00:30:09,337
compassion becomes the truth.

310
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:13,217
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

311
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:16,557
So all the absolute truth that you know is

312
00:30:16,757 --> 00:30:21,397
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

313
00:30:21,597 --> 00:30:26,307
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

314
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:29,677
and we felt this way and still it happened."

315
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:32,817
It makes no difference.

316
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:35,877
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

317
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:40,117
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

318
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:44,547
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

319
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:49,367
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

320
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:52,967
Because it had to be the other way round.

321
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:56,577
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

322
00:30:56,787 --> 00:31:01,607
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

323
00:31:01,807 --> 00:31:04,507
So, it's a play going on.

324
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:10,967
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

325
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:19,917
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

326
00:31:20,117 --> 00:31:25,427
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

327
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:30,097
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

328
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:34,207
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

329
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:41,937
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

330
00:31:42,217 --> 00:31:50,777
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

331
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:53,907
When you have the enlightened faith,

332
00:31:54,107 --> 00:32:00,637
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

333
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:06,677
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

334
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:11,997
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

335
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:17,877
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

336
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:21,657
Not necessarily. It's a play.

337
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:29,747
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

338
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:33,287
So if you can become the witness,

339
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:37,057
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

340
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:44,667
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

341
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:50,857
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

342
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:53,917
That dissolution has to take place.

343
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:57,837
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

344
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:03,577
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

345
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:07,877
this work could not have been done.

346
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:13,137
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

347
00:33:13,337 --> 00:33:25,237
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

348
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:29,307
all the aspects of this human life.

349
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:33,077
It had to be such an Incarnation

350
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:41,267
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

351
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:45,787
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

352
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:53,617
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

353
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:56,847
as a whole, as a human being.

354
00:33:57,047 --> 00:34:01,377
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

355
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:04,897
all of them are just the same.

356
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:14,267
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

357
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:18,347
some are not seeking genuinely,

358
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,997
and some are not seeking at all.

359
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:27,087
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

360
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:33,137
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

361
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:37,907
one fish came out of the mother.

362
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:45,077
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

363
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:50,597
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

364
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:55,827
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

365
00:34:56,227 --> 00:35:02,937
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

366
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:07,807
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

367
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:11,817
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

368
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:14,627
James or what St. John has said,

369
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:17,677
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

370
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,427
It doesn't matter.

371
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:27,297
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

372
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:31,477
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

373
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:36,487
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

374
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:41,907
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

375
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:46,107
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

376
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:49,087
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

377
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:53,347
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

378
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:57,507
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

379
00:35:57,707 --> 00:35:59,687
should not disturb you much

380
00:35:59,887 --> 00:36:04,437
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

381
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:08,487
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

382
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:13,027
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

383
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:19,077
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

384
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,267
all the useless things that we have,

385
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:26,837
like our conditioning and our ego.

386
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:30,067
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

387
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:33,987
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

388
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:38,057
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

389
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:42,497
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

390
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:44,437
That's human nature also.

391
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:48,277
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

392
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:52,007
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

393
00:36:52,207 --> 00:36:55,787
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

394
00:36:55,987 --> 00:37:00,447
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

395
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:02,587
It will all work out.

396
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:07,007
It will all work out, but your attention should be

397
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:14,377
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

398
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,197
of this compassion?".

399
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:22,727
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

400
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:26,457
which is going to give you strength.

401
00:37:26,657 --> 00:37:29,687
This compassion within you,

402
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:33,467
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

403
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,947
completely destroyed,

404
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:40,947
your compassion itself will make you powerful

405
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:45,407
and you'll do everything that is needed.

406
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:49,937
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

407
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:58,307
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

408
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:01,217
And amazingly as you will do this,

409
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:06,207
your own level of spirituality will rise.

410
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:11,037
As you see, I would say,

411
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:16,537
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

412
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:19,087
the water rises.

413
00:38:19,287 --> 00:38:25,357
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:29,337
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

415
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:33,947
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

416
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:36,497
there will be much more manifestation

417
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:42,937
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

418
00:38:43,297 --> 00:38:49,817
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

419
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:52,527
you all have got your Realization

420
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:57,127
and that you are all now saintly people,

421
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:00,727
then we should see to people who were like you.

422
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:04,917
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

423
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:08,957
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

424
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:14,547
What did they do? They went all out

425
00:39:14,747 --> 00:39:18,917
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

426
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:21,197
They could not give realization as such,

427
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:23,907
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

428
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:28,507
they talked about it, they sang about it.

429
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:31,887
That's what we have to understand

430
00:39:32,117 --> 00:39:41,237
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

431
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:43,727
When you know the people are getting drowned,

432
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:49,197
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

433
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:55,157
I should say,

434
00:39:55,357 --> 00:40:01,017
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

435
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:04,267
And if you have that compassion within you,

436
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:09,517
you will go all out to save them.

437
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:15,677
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

438
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:20,747
of this enjoyment of your attention.

439
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:24,257
Your attention itself will enjoy

440
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:33,597
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

441
00:40:33,797 --> 00:40:36,827
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

442
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:40,347
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

443
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:46,197
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

444
00:40:46,397 --> 00:40:52,707
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

445
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:55,387
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

446
00:40:55,587 --> 00:41:00,157
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

447
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:06,647
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

448
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:11,947
The more you use this power the better it will be.

449
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:17,067
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

450
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:21,257
For we haven't got many people from the black race

451
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:23,387
I think, from Africa.

452
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:27,917
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

453
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:31,317
Also, we have so many other areas

454
00:41:31,517 --> 00:41:34,747
where I find we have to work it out,

455
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:41,607
that if this compassion is within you

456
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:44,147
then it will compel you, also,

457
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:48,057
to do work that will bring solace to people

458
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,977
who are not even seeking.

459
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:56,317
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

460
00:41:56,517 --> 00:42:01,747
which will really create very beautiful institutions

461
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:06,617
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

462
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:10,857
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

463
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:15,697
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

464
00:42:15,897 --> 00:42:21,147
you have dropped out your greed,

465
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:27,357
you have dropped out your lust.

466
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:32,527
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

467
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:36,437
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

468
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,077
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

469
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,167
and then they start becoming leaders,

470
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:48,067
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

471
00:42:48,267 --> 00:42:51,127
This you will not do.

472
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:58,357
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

473
00:42:58,557 --> 00:43:04,787
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

474
00:43:04,987 --> 00:43:11,227
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

475
00:43:11,427 --> 00:43:15,497
Once we start spreading out like that,

476
00:43:15,697 --> 00:43:18,567
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

477
00:43:18,777 --> 00:43:21,797
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

478
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:28,627
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

479
00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:32,457
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

480
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:34,557
who don't have greed.

481
00:43:34,757 --> 00:43:37,697
I have known people who never had any greed,

482
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:43,577
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

483
00:43:43,777 --> 00:43:47,087
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

484
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:50,887
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

485
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,517
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

486
00:43:54,717 --> 00:43:57,147
But not Sahaja Yogis.

487
00:43:57,347 --> 00:43:59,577
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

488
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:05,647
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

489
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:08,997
Not their lust, not their greed

490
00:44:09,197 --> 00:44:12,917
and also the so-called deviations

491
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:19,737
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

492
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:22,667
Because they know what do they enjoy,

493
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:25,257
where lies their enjoyment.

494
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,857
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

495
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:31,667
you will try to have more of it

496
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:36,677
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

497
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:39,787
I would say as the men are working it out,

498
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:41,727
women should work it out

499
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:47,287
because women have more sense of compassion,

500
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,837
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

501
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:55,037
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

502
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:58,127
I'm saying about normal.

503
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:03,587
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

504
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:08,287
they have known what is love for the children is.

505
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:10,247
Mother doesn't expect anything.

506
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:14,127
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

507
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:17,327
She enjoys her child, that's all.

508
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:24,347
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

509
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:26,507
See, I have seen young girls.

510
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:30,107
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

511
00:45:30,317 --> 00:45:33,747
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

512
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:38,567
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

513
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:44,907
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

514
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:49,247
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

515
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:53,747
And as you are all married also,

516
00:45:53,947 --> 00:45:58,957
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

517
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:05,887
by your own nature of Divinity.

518
00:46:06,087 --> 00:46:08,207
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

519
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:12,297
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

520
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:16,337
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

521
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:19,987
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

522
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:23,737
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

523
00:46:23,937 --> 00:46:26,967
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

524
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:34,847
And if something

525
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:37,347
has to be done, has to be done.

526
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:39,727
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

527
00:46:39,927 --> 00:46:43,477
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

528
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:46,857
and the household and this and that".

529
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,657
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

530
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:53,387
The whole day, what will you do?

531
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:57,137
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

532
00:46:57,337 --> 00:47:01,187
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

533
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:05,607
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

534
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:10,757
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

535
00:47:10,957 --> 00:47:16,607
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

536
00:47:16,807 --> 00:47:24,977
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

537
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:29,117
then you'll be never tired.

538
00:47:29,317 --> 00:47:32,157
You will never grudge.

539
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:37,617
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

540
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:41,857
This is a very important point that we should realize

541
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:45,357
that if somebody is a woman or a man

542
00:47:45,557 --> 00:47:51,467
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

543
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:56,507
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

544
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:01,077
She has more power of compassion.

545
00:48:01,277 --> 00:48:04,597
In the same way the man has more power of action.

546
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:07,797
So, the compassion has to become active.

547
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:11,057
In this combination everything will work out

548
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,537
in a very beautiful manner.

549
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:18,517
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

550
00:48:18,717 --> 00:48:23,487
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

551
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:26,747
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

552
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,927
some of the women have been men

553
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:33,777
and some of the men have been women.

554
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:38,347
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

555
00:48:38,557 --> 00:48:44,277
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

556
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:45,897
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

557
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:48,637
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

558
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:51,537
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

559
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:53,537
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

560
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:56,547
Now here you should understand the relationship

561
00:48:56,757 --> 00:49:01,057
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

562
00:49:01,257 --> 00:49:07,227
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

563
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:09,727
God Almighty is the Spectator;

564
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:14,687
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

565
00:49:14,887 --> 00:49:17,297
She is compassion, of course.

566
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:21,277
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

567
00:49:21,477 --> 00:49:24,897
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

568
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:29,197
But He's the One who takes charge.

569
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:34,437
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

570
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:38,707
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

571
00:49:38,907 --> 00:49:43,807
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

572
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:47,307
how it has worked out.

573
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:51,557
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

574
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:55,827
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

575
00:49:56,027 --> 00:50:00,517
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

576
00:50:00,717 --> 00:50:06,047
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

577
00:50:06,247 --> 00:50:08,017
I can't understand

578
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:12,057
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

579
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:18,937
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

580
00:50:19,137 --> 00:50:22,937
who knows what is the truth,

581
00:50:23,137 --> 00:50:32,037
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

582
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:41,227
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

583
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:46,637
It is to realize

584
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:55,087
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

585
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:59,327
You have entered into His kingdom

586
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:05,867
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

587
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:09,337
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

588
00:51:09,537 --> 00:51:12,217
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

589
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:16,097
he still begs sitting on this throne.

590
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:20,097
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

591
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:22,967
I receive some funny letters sometimes

592
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:27,707
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

593
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:33,177
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

594
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:39,277
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

595
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,847
because it has a very bad impression,

596
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:47,297
also, for other people and for your own life.

597
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:51,137
For your own life, is very important

598
00:51:51,337 --> 00:51:55,517
that you should grow fully into the understanding

599
00:51:55,717 --> 00:52:01,647
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

600
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:05,917
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

601
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:10,247
What do you have to surrender?

602
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:14,687
Just think of it.

603
00:52:14,887 --> 00:52:22,217
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

604
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:28,527
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

605
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:35,307
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

606
00:52:35,507 --> 00:52:40,297
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

607
00:52:40,497 --> 00:52:45,287
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

608
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:48,537
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

609
00:52:48,737 --> 00:52:50,277
Impossible.

610
00:52:50,477 --> 00:52:55,547
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

611
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:58,317
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

612
00:52:58,517 --> 00:53:01,727
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

613
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:08,447
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

614
00:53:08,647 --> 00:53:12,467
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

615
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:19,007
have to enter into and work out.

616
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:20,727
You can do it.

617
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:26,187
You see, I was surprised that in this place

618
00:53:26,387 --> 00:53:31,577
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

619
00:53:31,777 --> 00:53:36,207
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

620
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:39,447
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

621
00:53:39,647 --> 00:53:46,467
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

622
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:52,247
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

623
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:55,497
As it is growing in quantity,

624
00:53:55,697 --> 00:53:59,407
it should also grow in quality.

625
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:04,467
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

626
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,777
Because I know all the time

627
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:09,827
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

628
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:13,307
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

629
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:17,657
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

630
00:54:17,857 --> 00:54:19,867
I know that feeling you have that,

631
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:23,497
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

632
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:25,567
So forget about them.

633
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:32,497
But those who are seeking, approach them.

634
00:54:32,707 --> 00:54:34,857
They are your real relations.

635
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:38,967
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

636
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:42,867
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

637
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:46,107
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

638
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:50,507
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

639
00:54:50,707 --> 00:54:54,447
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

640
00:54:54,647 --> 00:54:57,357
You should find out where are they.

641
00:54:57,557 --> 00:55:00,267
My attention is, of course, is with you

642
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:05,247
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

643
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:06,857
Whatever you want,

644
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:11,547
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

645
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:17,107
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

646
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:20,327
Because you take it upon yourself.

647
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:26,067
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

648
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:33,427
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

649
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:40,197
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

650
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:44,147
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

651
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:48,187
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

652
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:52,377
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

653
00:55:52,587 --> 00:55:55,627
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

654
00:55:55,837 --> 00:55:58,027
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

655
00:55:58,227 --> 00:56:01,227
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

656
00:56:01,427 --> 00:56:02,917
is Adi Shakti.

657
00:56:03,117 --> 00:56:06,417
It's very important that this puja must be performed

658
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:12,687
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

659
00:56:12,887 --> 00:56:15,847
and you grow more and more within yourself

660
00:56:16,047 --> 00:56:20,777
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

661
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:25,777
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

662
00:56:25,977 --> 00:56:28,457
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

663
00:56:28,657 --> 00:56:32,487
within you is the Kundalini.

664
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:33,937
So, you have to worship.

665
00:56:34,137 --> 00:56:38,297
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

666
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:41,867
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

667
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:45,567
May God bless you.
