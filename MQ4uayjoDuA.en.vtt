00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.040
Today is the anniversary day of the wedding,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.320
and I have allowed them to celebrate it,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.240
because marriage is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.320
It is one of the most important things for Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.960
that one should get married.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.960
Firstly marriage always gives you a balance of understanding,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.600
if you have proper ideas about marriage.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.840
If you have funny ideas

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.040
and if you are just marrying for fun's sake

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.840
and you do not understand the value of marriage,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.000
then it is just a joke, it's not a marriage.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.040
But in Sahaja Yoga you really understand

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.400
the value of marriage first of all, what it means.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
And then, luckily today we are going to have

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.680
some Sahaja Yoga weddings in which you will see, how we try

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.720
to conform to the divine laws of marriage,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.760
and get married under those laws.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.560
Here, I find in Australia, as well as in other countries,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.560
that marriage has lost its sanctity.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.600
People don't understand that by doing sin against the marriage,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.880
they are committing such great sins

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.560
that many generations will have to suffer for this kind of a thing.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.920
One has to understand that fidelity is the basis of marriage.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.120
If there is no fidelity, marriage has no meaning.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.040
If you are not capable of being fidel,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.800
that means you are not yet a human being.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.560
A human being has to be a fidel animal.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.560
In marriage we confirm that the problem is over now,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.240
we have finished with the choices we had,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.880
and now we are going to settle down with one person.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.040
And the sharing of life,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.960
the even absolutely private life, is with one person.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.960
So you have to be very much harmonised with that person,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.600
and in complete understanding

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.200
and loyalties to each other, one has to take to.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.840
Now the marriage is for the reproduction of the species as they say.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.760
Now as you are another species,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.280
you are Sahaja Yogis, it’s a new awareness,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.960
marriages between you will bring forth

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.560
children of very high caliber.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.440
There are great saints who are anxious to get married,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.440
to get birth on this Earth.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.040
And if they find good Sahaja Yogis,

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.920
husband and wife who love each other, are good,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.960
progressive people in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160
who are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.360
they would be definitely descending on this Earth through you.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.720
So it is very important and imminent, at this time,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.840
that one should understand the value,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.800
the value of the marriage of Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.960
So many marriages have taken place before also,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.400
but what is the validity

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.560
or what is the credibility of those marriages,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.640
when the person who marries them in the name of God

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.840
is not a realised soul?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.040
He has to be a realised soul to marry them.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.440
He has no authority to marry in the name of God.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.840
Alright, registration is a different thing altogether

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.360
because they do not marry in the name of God,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.640
they marry in the name of a nation.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.960
But if you have to marry in the name of God,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.280
you must have a realised soul to do that.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.040
And one should understand every bit of the marriage

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.240
that is performed, what you are doing, why you are doing.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.160
There are certain promises that are to be given.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.360
We have taken this marriage system from the old Vedic system,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.880
also changed it very much according to the Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.440
where we have been trying to use also certain ceremonies

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.560
which are done in the churches and other religions,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.720
but mainly it is based on the Kundalini.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.640
So the promise is to the fire.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.360
In this marriage the promise is to the fire.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.840
Because fire is the one that burns off all that is ugly.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.080
And Kundalini is also like a fire on one point,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.520
because that’s the only energy that rises above.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.480
See, so like the fire goes upward, the Kundalini also rises upwards.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.920
That’s why it is compared with the fire.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.280
But fire is the energy which is in the stomach,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.200
which is the dharma, which is the religion.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.640
And the religion of the Sahaja Yogis is to keep in the centre,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.160
not to go to extremes. And when they get married,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.960
by their understanding of Sahaja Yoga

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.040
they pull each other towards the centre much more,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.320
and enjoy themselves, the present, the present moment,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.960
and the present as it is.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.720
Sahaja Yoga marriages can be really fantastic,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.840
if the Sahaja Yogis who marry are sensible,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.520
are equally balanced, or are not criticising each other,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.240
not taking an upper hand.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.840
It is possible for one Sahaja Yogi to marry another one,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.880
to gradually upgrade that Sahaja Yogi.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.640
It is possible also to degrade.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.560
If another Sahaja Yogi is more powerful

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.560
or negative so much that it can degrade also another person.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.080
It depends on your quality to be upgraded or degraded.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.560
So marriage is a very big blessing in Sahaja Yoga

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.680
because all the Gods

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.120
and all the angels are watching these marriages,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.200
and they will see to it that these marriages are successful.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.720
But if you are bent upon making them unsuccessful

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.600
because you still have the same kind of an awareness

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.720
which you had before and you want to go to the same,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.360
it can fail also. Like animals.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.120
If you live with the animals,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.800
even human beings can become like animals.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.240
So the Sahaja Yogis must know that their awareness is changed,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.840
they are different people,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.520
they have to live with Sahaja Yogis and not with

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.360
other human beings who are not yet realised.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.120
They can talk to them, but they must know that

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.840
Sahaja Yogis are at a very different level of awareness.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.880
If they realise this point, if they understand this simple point,

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.200
that their awareness is very different,

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.720
they would adjust much better in married life.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.720
There's no divorce in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.760
We do not think of a divorce. But there's nothing forced.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.280
I mean, if they fail to live together,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.040
it’s a shame, but so far we have had no divorces.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.280
But as the people are coming from every sort of culture and things,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.680
there is a possibility, that people may like to divorce legally.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.000
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like divorce,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.760
but there's no force on anyone.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.520
And one must try to understand marriage,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.640
that it is for your enjoyment.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.560
If you cannot enjoy the marriage

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.560
then it is of no use to you.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.360
In Sahaja Yoga it is to be ensured that people enjoy their marriages

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.200
and live very well, happily, with each other.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.520
It is the responsibility of all the people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.080
But say in my case, own case, my husband was not a realised soul,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.400
nor did he understood realisation, nor was he a seeker.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.040
Despite all these…

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.200
It would like to come to Me, it was sitting in my lap throughout.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.960
…And despite all that, you see, I didn’t get upset or anything,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.760
I didn’t push him. I didn’t push anyone.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.600
I said, "Gradually he will be able to see it through."

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.280
So even if the person, another person is not a realised soul,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.720
one can manage it very well, and can live very happily.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.080
But in case you get both the people realised,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.400
then it's a much better thing and should be enjoyed.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.920
But the interest should be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.520
If you have other interest then there could be problems.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.000
Because a Sahaja Yogi could not tolerate his wife

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.120
or a Sahaja Yogini would not tolerate her husband

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.840
to waste his energy on nonsensical things.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.240
And a new sort of a conflict will start between Sahaja Yoga

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.680
and the Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginis.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.960
So it should never be a matter of conflict,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.320
because we have so many ways and methods of finding out

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.760
what's the matter with us. And if there is anything wrong with us,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.520
we should try to face it and clear it out.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.200
We should not try to clear each other’s chakras, but our own.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.560
Actually we do not pay attention to ourselves,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.960
we start paying attention to others.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.960
Moreover, I must say that Sahaja Yoga marriages

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.120
will be the most successful marriages. Have to be.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.800
They may re-establish the institution of marriage

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.080
on very sound basis. There’s no doubt about it.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.160
And those who’ll be married in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.520
will be really remarkably happy married couples.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.880
But there will be an attack of the negativity on them

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.960
as soon as they get married.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.400
Because it is

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.560
not a very happy thing for these negative forces,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.400
to see that people are happily married.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.040
And they would try their level best to bring all sorts of problems,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.680
all sorts of complications in the beginning,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.040
to see that these marriages are broken.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.440
And when you start playing into their hands, you may

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.520
also be spoiling the chances of getting good realised souls to you,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.720
because they would not accept such a situation.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.640
If you have been quarrelling in the beginning also it’s not good,

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.840
because you go down in their estimation.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.280
So you have to be very patient,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.840
very soft and good to each other,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.640
to see that you create an atmosphere of invitation

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.240
for these great souls to come on this Earth.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.360
And if that is not so, then they will wait,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.880
they will not incarnate,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.040
because they don’t want to have parents

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.520
who are quarrelling, who are fighting, who are suspecting,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.440
who are troubling each other.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.600
Now, one has to know that Sahaja Yoga marriage has a precise reason.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.480
It is not, you are marrying just out of fashion.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.720
You are marrying because you want to have children,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.600
who are realised souls on this Earth to come.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.880
We give them a place, parentage to do that.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.640
And if you do not understand the value of that marriage,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.240
then it is better not to be married in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.040
It’s better to spare the Sahaja Yoga!

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.520
There’s only one snag in Sahaja Yoga, is this,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.560
that you are all born of the same Mother,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.000
so you are all brothers and sisters in a way.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.240
But when you are going to marry each other,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.360
then this point becomes a little funny

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.080
that - how can a brother marry a sister?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.640
Now, we can say like that, that I would say that,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.640
it would be better if you marry not in the same community

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.520
but marry from somewhere else. At the most,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.320
the Sydney Sahaja Yogi should marry a Melbourne Sahaja Yogini.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.400
Some distance should be like that

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.840
so that it is kept like not brothers and sisters - should be better.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.120
But I’ve seen when this happens there is more conflict,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.560
because they still carry on with the idea

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.360
that they are from Melbourne and another from

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.360
Sydney.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.600
Now the Sydney and Melbourne should not be a matter of conflict.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.800
Because as soon as they start quarrelling they’ll say,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.640
“Oh, you Melbournian, I know you are like that.”

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.400
And she'll say, "You Sydneyans, you are like that."

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.200
And immediately you become like that,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.040
and you start quarrelling about it.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.720
So you must know that you are not a Sydneyan or a Melbournian,

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.560
but you are nothing but a Sahaja Yogi.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.160
And Sahaja Yogi has no caste, community

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.360
or any race, or any religion,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.440
or also no bar of any nation.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.560
Whatever nation you come from, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.960
you are a universal being. You are.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.960
You can feel the vibrations of anyone sitting down here,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.440
whether he is from Hawaii or from America doesn’t matter.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.600
So, when you can feel about everyone, that means

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.040
you are no more belonging to any community

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.960
or any particular country, you are a universal being.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.200
And that’s what we have to do:

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.280
we have to create more universal beings.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.600
And to expedite that we want to get these great souls on this Earth.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.040
So it’s a very important work. They have to be on this Earth,

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.360
because they are the great channels for this divine work.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.360
Once they start descending on this Earth, the real ones,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.320
it will all expedite. It will be such a great,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.120
you don’t know, it will be such a great, sudden,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.080
explosion of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.320
You’ll be amazed how it can grow

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.440
faster with these people coming down.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.680
And we should try to make such arrangements

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.600
that we get the real blessings of those people,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.760
that they come down on this Earth. It’s very important.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.720
So I would request you to think about the marriage

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.560
from a new angle and from new ideas

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.280
by which you can really understand the value,

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.680
the value of these marriages.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.600
And then you make it a successful marriage,

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.080
and not a failure, a nonsense, of it.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.240
That’s such a great simple thing to do,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.880
because you are married before realised souls.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.200
So there is no question of being

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.760
just married like other people are married, and then they,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.560
they take a name-plate on their,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.000
on their cars saying 'Just married',

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.240
and they go, they are going, to a divorce case.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.840
There cannot be such a thing for Sahaja Yogis, it’s a serious thing.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.440
If you are not serious enough about it better not marry.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.400
If you have expectations about marriage, it is better not to marry.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.400
It is better not to marry. Nobody is going to force you to marry.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.000
Just say, "No, not at all, I’m not going to."

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.160
But if you are going to go on like this,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.560
you are really be harming Sahaja Yoga in the worst possible way.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.800
It is like stabbing Sahaja Yoga from the back.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.160
So there is no need for you to get married,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.080
in case you do not want to have it. On the contrary,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.960
it will be better that there are many married couples

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.320
who can produce children,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.280
and they can have those great people born to them.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.160
But if you think that adjustment and all that it means

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.360
all kinds of these old ideas of married life,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.480
it’s better that you do not get married.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.160
It’s a new heavenly marriage, for which you should be prepared

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.040
to receive the beauty and the blessings,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.680
and also the greatest of greatest,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.160
the ultimate meaning of it.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.840
I hope you will understand,

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.800
that Sahaja Yoga is emphazising on marriages,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.520
and we do not believe in any asceticism,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720
the running away from family life,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.400
we believe that family life is the most important thing.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.800
We have to establish it very well on this Earth,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.480
and that we have to see in these beautiful nests of divine love

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.920
that great souls are born, and we have to continue with it.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:29.160
There's no escape from having a very good married life.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.600
And I wish you, all of you,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.640
that you will have a very good happy married life.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.960
And those who are not marrying I wish them

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.960
that they also will have a very happy married life.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.560
Now I have been married, I think thirty-sixth year

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.400
is this of my marriage today.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.760
So many years have passed but still,

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.680
I still feel like a bride with my husband,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.400
because really we have been very wise people to live like that.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.040
And of course there are ups and downs,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.120
but ultimately one feels very different about the whole thing.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.320
He has sent a beautiful letter today,

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.440
thanking you all for your kindness shown to Me,

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.600
and for all the kindness you have shown to him.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.520
So we should have the puja, this, today, as a Gruha Lakshmi.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.440
You are worshipping Me as a Gruha Lakshmi in you,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.960
and which is very essential also, to worship Me as a Gruha Lakshmi,

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.760
because you all have a problem with your Gruha Lakshmi.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.680
That's the Left Nabhi. So I hope it will work out better for you,

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.680
and we’ll start with the puja.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.960
After this short puja that we have,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.560
then we’ll start with this Devi havan,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.560
because this we have not been able to do so far,

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.120
and this is very important. We have to somehow or other manage it.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.000
Today if possible, we should do thousand names,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.840
would be a very good idea.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.560
Both of you.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.440
Who else is getting married?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.920
You also? Let these two people.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.880
You two come along.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.880
Yogi: They may read three names.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.160
We can make place for one couple to sit over here.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.560
Can I get some more place?

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.800
SM: How can you sit there? You will spread something?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.240
Have you got something to spread? No, no, no, no.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.880
Better spread some more of these.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.800
These are very handy things eh? They may have.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.440
Yogi: Two more?

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.360
You can pull that. I think that’s a better idea.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.200
Just now we are not going to sit there,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.160
so you can pull all this out. Why not spread it here?

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.920
No, no, it’s alright. No, that’s okay.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.080
This is better to pull this out.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.640
Yogi: Don't push it, don't push this.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.400
Let them lie it down Bill. Let them lie them and drag down.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:10.320
Ok, just stand up Bill and we'll spread this over the whole lot.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.760
Take it here.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.680
SM: Now you all sit down.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.440
For Modi you have to give him something below.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.520
Come along, sit down.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.400
Now, who else is there? She’s left. Right?

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.760
You can sit there. You can move there.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.680
You see, just have that thing connected there.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.360
You can move it, you see.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.200
Y: And that's one point left.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.320
SM: That’s sufficient now. That’s alright. Now you sit down.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.920
It’s alright?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.960
Now one more you want? Just leave it. Leave it.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.520
Y: Move back a little bit.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.480
Don't move that Tina.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.080
Don't lean on it.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.600
Can You manage?... not on the ground.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.720
Yes, that’s better. This is better.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.640
You spread it more like that. This is a better thing.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.960
It's good now.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.480
It's a short one. Not too long. Alright?

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.240
Alright.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.880
First is Ganesha puja.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.600
Tell the meaning.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.440
They should know the meaning.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.680
This is a...I have told him to, today, say it out.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.560
Now this is what we were saying that Christ is described in short.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.880
This is a very short description. And what He is actually

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.960
His all aspects have been described in short,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.480
again in short, very much in short.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.320
These few things he will be reading it and explaining it to you

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.120
while you just wash my Feet.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.400
Now you organise it.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.320
Y: Now here we worship the Lord Jesus,

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.840
in the name of Lord Ganesha.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.560
He is supposed to be in totality,

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.920
the essence of all the principles. He is in totality.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.640
SM: Principles, all the principles.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.960
Y: All the principles of the universe.
SM: Tattwa.

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.480
Y: Tattwam asi, means

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.240
the totality of all the principles of the universe.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.320
Then he is supposed to be the kartasi.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.560
Kartasi means He is supposed to do

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.920
all the doings.
SM: The Doer.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.120
It is He who does all the doings.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.760
Then he says, "Twameva kevalam dhartasi" means He is the..

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.440
SM: Support.
Y: Supporter of all the things in the universe.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.960
SM: He is the Support.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.080
Y: Then He is the kevalam hartasi - harane.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.480
SM: He is the One who takes away all the problems.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.280
Y: He takes away all the problems,

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.560
He takes away all the problems of the universe.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.520
SM: He's the One, He’s the sucker of all the problems of the whole.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.320
Y: Then, then it is said, "Twameva sarvidam kalvidam Brahmasi" means

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.400
"He is the totality of the universe."

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.120
Brahma, Brahma.
SM: Brahma is this Brahma shakti you see,

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.840
Y:  All-pervading Energy. Pranav.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.200
"He Himself is allpervading energy."

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.080
Twameva Sakshat Atmasi nityam. He is always-

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:32.840
SM: -present in you as the Spirit.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.760
He resides you as Spirit in everything.
Y:Ritam vachmi satyam vachmi.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.920
He always says the truth.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.080
He always says, whatever He says..
SM: He is the truth.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.640
Not "He says the truth", but "He is the truth."

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.600
Y: Ritam vachmi satyam vachmi.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.760
Here he says that He is supposed to be -

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.680
He is supposed to be the Doer as we say, that means

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.520
the hearing is done by Him,

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.440
the speaking is also done by Him.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.280
He is in the Shishya. Shishya means,

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.760
SM: In the disciples. In the disciple principle.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.400
Y: Disciple principle is also the Lord Ganesha.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.160
It is in the principle of teacher also,

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.760
is the principle of Lord Jesus.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.800
It is also on all the directions that is east, west, north, south.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.400
He exists in all the directions.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.360
And since He exists in all the directions,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.800
He is All-pervading,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.960
everywhere, on the top, in the bottom, everywhere.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.680
He says, "the entire

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.720
vangmay",

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.800
Vangmay means literature.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.440
The entire literature is He, Himself.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.960
He is the complete literature.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.480
He is the complete ananda. Ananda means ‘joy’.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.640
Brahma-mayas, ananda mayas Twam Brahma mayas

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.160
You are the One who is the All-pervading Power within us.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.720
He is the All-pervading power within us.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.840
Sat Chit Ananda dvitiyosi,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.320
The Sat Chit Ananda means, dvitiyosi means,

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.680
You, You, nobody can compare You, to Your,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.720
Your capacities to be Sat Chit Ananda.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.800
Sat Chit Ananda means, Sat means truth, Chit means attention

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.640
and Ananda means joy. So it's a completion.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.840
And nobody can be compared with you.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.680
Twam Pratyaksham Brahmasi. You are in totality, existing Brahma.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.720
The Creator.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.600
Twam Dnyanamayo Vignyanamayosi.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800
You are the knowledge and You are the

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.720
Science of it, science of knowledge.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.080
That means here he says, "When the whole world,

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.720
goes away,

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.840
is destroyed, it is He who remains.”

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.760
Sarvam jagadidam twattas-tishtati

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.760
When the whole body..No, “Tish thati” means "it stays".

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.280
The whole world stays because of You.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.560
As long as you are there the world will stay.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.560
Let him be. Let him be. That, that's also very...

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.800
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.720
Sarvam jagadidam twayi layam'eshyati.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.960
When You are completely, the whole world is destroyed,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.440
at that time also You are there. You are the witness.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.200
Sarvam Jagadidam Twayi Pratiyety.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.640
And everybody can only experience You and nothing else.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.080
Everybody can experience, that experience is through Him.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.800
If you are getting any experience of Divine it is because of Him.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.720
Him, through Him, through Him.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.160
Twam Bhumir-apo-nalo-nilo nabhah

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.240
He is the soil.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.280
He is the, 'apo' means the 'jala tattwa',

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.840
means He is the water.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.480
And He's the Akasha.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.080
'Anala' means 'Agni', fire.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.520
He is the fire. "Nilo nabhaha", means He is the Akasha.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.640
He is the sky, ether.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.120
He is the fire also.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.760
All the elements.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.040
Twam chatwari vak padani

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:33.400
These are also guided by Him.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.280
There are, you see, four stages of your sound.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.120
You see when they - para, pashanti, madhyama.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:48.160
You see, there are four stages of your sound that starts from here.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.920
First one from the nabhi, second one from here, Para,

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.720
pashanti, madhyama and vaikary.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.080
Vaikary means from the sound here which we speak. Talk.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.240
You see, the sound starts from here.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.640
This is 'para'. Sound starts from para.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.080
From here it starts, then it goes to pashanti.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.480
In the heart it just pulsates.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.360
But it is 'pashanti', means it is just watching.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.640
Here it is 'madhyama'. It is in the centre.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.280
Means it is doesn’t either watch, nor this thing.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.760
And then, at the mouth part becomes eloquent.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.880
So "all these four stages of the sound are governed by You".

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.000
Now, here  He has been described in a little different way:

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.960
He is beyond all the gunas, that means beyond all the virtues.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.600
No, no, not gunas. 'Gunas means 'moods', moods, moods. Qualities.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.760
You see, Tamogun, Rajogun and Sattvagun, He’s beyond that,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.480
He's transcended. You see, for Him there’s nothing like sin.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.480
Whatever He does is Divine.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.440
Twam deha traya teetaha

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.800
You are beyond Your body.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.560
You see that’s why He was resurrected.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.880
Twam kala traya teeth

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.680
You are beyond the Time and beyond the death.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.280
Twam Mooladhar stityosi nityam

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.840
Means the Mooladhara Chakra of the universe.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.240
There He resides.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:39.200
Twam Shakti trayat makaha

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.680
You are the three powers. All the powers.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.880
Three powers, na? - 'Trayat makaha'

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.000
Means all these three powers: Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.160
Twam yogino dyayanti nityam

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.560
Means, "Yogis, means all the saints of the universe,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.600
they always meditate upon You." And upon Him.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.320
All the time.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.200
'Nityam' means 'everytime'.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.880
Twam Brahma. Means He is Brahma. He's the Creator.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.560
He is Vishnu. He is the Sustainer. He’s the Protector also.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.160
He is Rudra. He is the one who destroys.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.480
He is the Indra.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:24.960
Indra is the God of the Gods.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.840
Agni, He is the fire.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.200
He is the wind.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.360
He is the sun, He is the moon.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.360
Brahma bhoor swarom

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.320
He is the sound of God. Omkara.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.360
Now here, how the Omkara has come out

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.880
through Him and how every aspect of Omkara

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.960
is He Himself.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.120
He’s the assemblage of all that.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.080
Ganaadim purva muchchaarya

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:54.160
Gana means all the, all the celestial beings on the left-hand side

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.400
are called as ganas, you see?

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.800
The leader of them is St. Michael.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.760
He is even before them. He’s born even before them.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.280
He’s even higher than them.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.920
Varnaadim tadanantaram

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.600
‘Varana' means..

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.160
All the varanas are created after Him.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.600
You see, this is what is Alpha and Omega,

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.480
that He is the first Word that is created,

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.640
and it is the last Word,

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.120
He's above the last Word that is created. Varana.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.120
Anusvaraha paratarah

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.880
It’s very detailed. Anuswaraha.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.840
You see there is a state after Realisation which is supposed to be,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.680
above this, above Sahastrara, is Ardha Bindu Sthiti,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.800
Bindu Sthiti and Valaya Sthiti.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.320
So from Bindu Sthiti, all the sthitis,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.080
all the stages, from Bindu Sthiti onwards,

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.440
there are something like fourteen stages above,

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.760
all the stages are governed by Him.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:20.480
Ardha Bindu Sthiti is also Him. The first stage of Ardha Bindu.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.760
Taarena ruddham

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.040
The One who gives you salvation.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.880
Etattava anusvaruupam

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.160
You see the vibrations. I don’t know if you can see them?

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.560
It looks like a comma, 'anusvarah' is 'commas'.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.560
So that's how You reside like little, little commas.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.360
If you can see them.
It's a comma of light.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.320
Gakara purva roopam

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.720
You see, the complete Omkara is: first is Gakarah, is Ganapati. Ga.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.200
"Ga-karah purva-rupam". The first is,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.280
you see, You take the form of Ganesha in the beginning,

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.520
“purva-rupam”, Ganesha is in them (vibrations).

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.240
Then You take the form of Omkara.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.360
Akaro madhyama rupam

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.400
Anuswarash-chantya rupam

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.200
And the last is when You become just a comma.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:37.000
Anusvarash chantyaroopam, bindurut tararoopam

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.600
Nadah sandhanam, sanhita sandihi, saisha Ganesha vidya

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:56.560
If you have to learn Him from the sound, then,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.560
then that knowledge, that, the knowledge of learning

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.160
through the sound, is known as 'Shri Ganesha vidya'.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.840
Sound is mantras, you see. To know Him through the mantras,

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:19.240
you have to learn the Ganesha-vidya, is the knowledge of Jesus.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.280
If you have to know the mantras, you have to know

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.200
through the knowledge that the whole science is called,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.880
is 'The knowledge of Ganesha'.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.200
Or you can call the 'vidya of Ganesha',

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.120
means the technique of Ganesha.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.280
And if you have to know how the mantras work out,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.880
this is the science. The science is called as Ganesha-vidya,

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.400
is all His science.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.240
Then the rishi of that, that is the master,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.320
the teacher of that vidya, that knowledge,

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.200
is supposed to be the Ganaka-Rishihi

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.240
It is His name: 'Ganaka-Rishihi’.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.840
That’s why He’s called as Ganaka, Ganaka-Rishihi.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:55.200
That’s why He’s called, because He’s the master of that.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:01.400
He’s the master of the art of mantras, the sounds.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:09.160
Then Vishwa Gayatri Chandaha, means He is the master of Gayatri.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.240
It’s a mantra, Gayatri is one of the mantras, you see.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.760
And it is on the right-hand side.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.160
Chandah is a...

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.520
Music, music of all the mantras.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.080
Music of all the mantras.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.040
The rhythm, rhythm.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.040
The rhythm of the mantras.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.480
You see, you have to say mantras with a certain rhythm,

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.120
and He’s the rhythm.

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.760
Of all the mantras.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.840
Now the God Himself is again Ganesha,

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.880
that is the Lord Jesus.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.040
God Himself for all this performation, He's again Shri Ganesha.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.640
Ganapatir-devata

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:07.920
Om Gam Ganapataye namah

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:13.880
How to initiate.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.040
What do you say when it should awaken?

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.160
How to awaken this deity.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.520
For that the mantra has been given all here.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:26.320
That mantra is like this: Om gam Ganapataye namaha

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.720
This is the mantra for awakening this Deity.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.080
Om gam Ganapataye namaha

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.640
Then there is a prayer for Him.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.720
Then subsequently, then two stanzas is a prayer for Him,

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.160
prayer for this God. I will just recite it.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.600
Ekadantaya vidmahe, vakratundaya dhimahi

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.200
Tanno danti prachodayaat

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.680
Ekadantam Chatur hastam

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.280
Pasham ankush dharinam

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.560
How this God is. How? How does He behave?

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.560
You see the Ganesha.
How is His description?

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.320
That description has been made over here.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.360
He is having one..

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.560
One tooth.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.720
Because with another one He writes.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.120
And He's got the trunk.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.440
Pasham ankusha dharinam

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.960
Is one of the loops.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.160
You see, He controls you with a loop.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.960
If you try to misbehave then he puts a loop around you,

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.600
and pulls you back.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.240
Ankush means is a kind of an instrument.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.320
Ankusha is that you use it on the elephant

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.080
to control.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.760
No, no, when you use it on the elephant.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.120
On the top, when you sit, in that particular point.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.680
It’s a ‘goad’

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.320
But it is a very..it’s a guiding instrument.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.240
Ekadantam chatur hastam

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.480
pasham ankusha dharinam

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.360
All these things He is having.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.160
Radam cha varadam Hastayhi

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.320
“Varada Hastha”, means He is offering you a hand

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.080
of protection.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:10.600
bibhranam mushaka dvajam

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.880
A mouse is His carrier, is a symbol.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.160
I mean, it’s something, a very humble animal.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.520
Very humble. His mouse,

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.240
for Him and for Christ also, the donkey,

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.200
which is the humblest animal.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.560
Raktam lambodaram

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.200
shurpakarnakam raktavaasasam

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.320
Means He wears the red clothes.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.320
He likes to wear the red clothes,

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.360
the one which Mataji has been wearing just now. The red thing.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.960
Red clothes.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.320
Rakta gandhanu liptangam

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.800
This particular on forehead. Rakta.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.400
Means it should be the red one.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.720
Even on the body He would like to put the red saffron and red things

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.320
At least on his chakras we should put red.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:02.880
'Rakta-pushpaihi supujitam', means He likes the red flowers very much.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.480
That's why on that day you had brought so many red flowers

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.400
on the other day for the puja.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:14.480
So it is 'supujitam', means if you want to do an ideal puja,

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:16.800
‘Supujitam’ means, if you want to do an ideal puja,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.840
you have to have the red flowers for Him.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.280
Bhaktanu kampinam Devam, jagat karanam achyutam

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.360
For the devotees,

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.360
for the devotees He has tremendous compassion.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.320
Tremendous compassion.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:39.440
And the compassion is for the good of the whole universe.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:44.960
The compassion which flows through Him is for the universal good.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.360
Avir bhutam chya shrishshtyadau prakrutehe purushat param

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.520
He comes on the Earth everytime,

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.040
to do manifestation, into the human beings,

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.680
I mean to give emancipation to the human beings.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.280
and that's how He manifests even as a human being.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.960
See!

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.920
Evam dya yati yo nityam sa yogi yoginam varaha

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.080
So the one, the yogi, who recites,

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:17.280
The yogi, not an unknown person. No,no! A Yogi.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.160
Means anybody going to church,
is not a yogi.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.600
That's not a yogi. See an yogi...

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.560
The connection through which you know the Divine,

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.760
is supposed to be a yogi.
Yoga.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.840
You see, “yena jayate” means “by which you know”.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:41.320
So, the connection through which you know the Divine

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.400
is known as yoga.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.600
Now, such yogis,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.600
such yogis worship this Lord Ganesha and the Lord Jesus

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.280
in this fashion all along by meditation.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.240
Only the yogis, again!

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.400
And they meditate. They worship by meditation,

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.960
not by chanting mantras like we just know.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:15.480
Namo Vratapataye, namo Ganapataye, Namah pramatha pataye

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.520
Namastestu Lambodaraya, Ekadantaya Vighnanashine,

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.760
Shri Shivasutaya Shri Varada murtaya namoh namaha

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.960
Here, such Divine personality,

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.200
I bow to You,

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.040
Bow to You,

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.120
always and in all purity I bow to You

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.600
That's what it says. Everytime...
Because He's purity.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.320
Everytime, for any good cause I bow to You

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:48.720
and You are the son of the Spirit.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.160
That's what it has been said. ‘Shivasutaya’ means -

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.240
The Son of Shiva.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:59.200
He is born out of Shiva. Shiva is the Spirit of the universe.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.240
You know Shiva, You know.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.160
Shri Varadam murtaye namoh namaha

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.800
You are the One..

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:18.360
You are the statue of blessings.

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.040
Ki Jay! This is just the abridged form.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:33.080
Most abridged form. There are only eight slokas.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.440
Eight stanzas, very small.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.720
Let's go. This is nothing to understand Him.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.440
But just this is said, is just in the beginning, to make it...

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.120
You've got this book in English?

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.600
No, Mother.
No?

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.120
You see, the Gods, you see.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.680
You are also Gods now because you have all the powers -

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.120
Prayed to Vishnu to create a Power

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.640
by which all these horrible devils can be destroyed.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.520
And then a Goddess was created.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.000
This story is better to hear.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:24.040
Mother in the Devi Mahatmyam

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.200
there's a description of the concentration

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.600
of the three Deities and out of the concentration of light

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.080
comes the Devi. Is that the same story?

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.320
That is exactly the same story.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.000
Then we have it in the Devi Mahatmyam. It’s in English

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.720
You’ve got Devi Bhagwat?

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.040
No, Devi Mahatmyam.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:45.640
You have got it?
We've got it at home, yes.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.640
I wish you had read it. Alright.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.120
So I just now then recite the whole thing from timing.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.800
We know the story, Mother.
You know the story?

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.920
Brian has read the story to the puja which we had...

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.640
Alright, again say the mantras.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.720
Raul Bai is very particular about the ritual to be done properly!

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.320
I said the brain should be alright, first of all.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.080
If you go on doing everything properly, doing this, do this…

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.320
First of all ego must go, otherwise what’s the use?

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.320
There is some yoghurt in that?

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.000
How many they are?

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.400
So get up now.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.320
And you have to just sort of open it. Please you also get up. Alright?

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.240
Now take it.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.720
Make it double.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.960
Just double it up. Alright?

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.160
You’ve been working very hard, I must say, really!

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:13.080
You have been really working very hard.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.520
To have two pujas is too much.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.200
You see, the raktagandha. He likes to be

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.440
covered with raktagandha, you see.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:32.520
This is a kind of a tree we get called as raktagandha,

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:37.640
which is like the sandalwood but is red-coloured.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.840
And He likes it to be all the time covered with it.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.800
That’s why I have to cover Myself,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.520
cover this portion where He resides.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.000
Raktagandha.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.160
“Rakta” means blood, and “gandha” means this particular

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.240
type of a sandalwood it is, which is of the red colour,

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.360
which is rubbed and is put here.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.400
This is typically Bali? Or Australian?

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:59.040
So much vibrations always. Just I’m doing it.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.400
You have said all the mantras, she says now. She’s finished.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.640
Let’s see who gets the best!

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.160
Where is Barbara?

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.360
Come along, take your photograph.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:09.480
She's got my camera Mother.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.280
Let her have one.

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:15.760
Let’s see now, this will decide.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:39.400
See, your photographs also depend on your

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.640
state of mind, very much so.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.440
Done?

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:58.880
Alright? May God bless you! Does he want? Come on.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.480
You can come closer, for my feet.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.960
Come along, you have to do my feet also.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.720
Done? Over?

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:35.280
Let her take it. She wants to.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.240
All the best, Mother. All the best.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.480
For the sanctity of marriage. May God bless you all.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.400
To give you the full idea of sanctity of marriage.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.320
Let’s start doing it.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:46.520
Now, you all have to get up from here

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:52.520
and some people who are come for the first time

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.800
should come forward.

01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:01.240
Who have come for the first time, should come forward.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.360
And you can also take a stool for yourself or something, or a chair.
