03:42:32.481 --> 03:42:44.940
It was a great concert today and I'm sure you'll always remember this one.

03:42:44.990 --> 03:42:53.430
The way it was all played so well, I have no words really to describe my joy.

03:42:53.430 --> 03:43:01.950
But all of you have started now appreciating classical Indian music is a very great thing

03:43:01.950 --> 03:43:05.830
for this great art.

03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:12.470
I had a fear that it might disappear one day because people do not have that depth to feel

03:43:12.470 --> 03:43:15.870
the beauty of this great music.

03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:22.030
But I'm happy to say that all these sahaja yogis all over the world enjoy classical music

03:43:22.030 --> 03:43:25.830
so much.

03:43:25.830 --> 03:43:36.310
I have to thank Mrs. Rajam, especially my daughter and Mr. Ramkumar Mishra for giving

03:43:36.310 --> 03:43:44.390
us such a nice, beautiful idea about how great is our music in our country.

03:43:44.390 --> 03:43:50.670
We have to spread it all over the world and let people see for themselves how soothing,

03:43:50.670 --> 03:43:59.310
comforting, relieving also how joy giving it is.

03:43:59.310 --> 03:44:05.590
I'm happy that she has made it possible to come, though she has to go somewhere else.

03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:12.110
The whole night she has kept awake and despite that she has played the whole thing with such

03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:19.870
concentration and with such creativity which is unimaginable.

03:44:19.870 --> 03:44:24.790
The daughter also is doing very well now.

03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:27.710
She has a little daughter of three months.

03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:32.230
She has left her there and came away just to play for you.

03:44:32.230 --> 03:44:46.270
It is very kind of them.

03:44:46.270 --> 03:44:54.550
Also Mr. Ramkumar Mishra is such a young boy, I should say, but he plays so well and how

03:44:54.550 --> 03:45:01.230
he keeps the pace with the musician, he doesn't show off in any way, nor does he try to outpeak

03:45:01.230 --> 03:45:02.230
them.

03:45:02.230 --> 03:45:04.190
So beautiful we call it the Sangat.

03:45:04.190 --> 03:45:09.070
In the way he accompanies, accompaniment is really to be understood with what patience

03:45:09.070 --> 03:45:11.830
and balance he does it.

03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:18.390
I hope all this concert will also inspire you to learn classical Indian music and to

03:45:18.390 --> 03:45:23.550
show your appreciation by learning it as well.

03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:25.160
May God bless you all.
