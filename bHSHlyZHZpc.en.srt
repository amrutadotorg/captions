1
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:51,088
﻿So, this is to thank you all for

2
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,260
helping in building this house

3
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,900
and making it so beautiful.

4
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,780
All the thankfulness

5
00:04:05,437 --> 00:04:07,186
is from

6
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:10,374
us, both of us, to you.

7
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:14,937
Today is a very

8
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,643
interesting day when

9
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:21,660
you are worshipping the Gruhalakshmi here,

10
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,700
means the Gruhalakshmi of this house.

11
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:27,424
In the same way

12
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,106
in your family also, in your houses, homes you must

13
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,196
do Gruhalakshmis’ puja.

14
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,316
The woman has to be

15
00:04:37,517 --> 00:04:39,528
the Gruhalakshmi herself

16
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,672
and then she should be worshipped.

17
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:46,355
“Yatya naria pujyante, tatra bhramante Devata.”

18
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:48,780
Where the women are respected

19
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,522
and worshipped there

20
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,155
reside all the deities.

21
00:04:55,356 --> 00:04:57,460
But they should be respectable also.

22
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,828
If they are not respectable

23
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:02,536
then the deities won’t reside there.

24
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,315
So, it’s a big responsibility

25
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,740
on a Gruhalakshmi to be respectable

26
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,859
so that all the deities are happy in the family.

27
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,300
And once she is respected,

28
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,860
she will try to be respectable also.

29
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,580
So, the respect

30
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,399
of the Gruhalakshmi is very important.

31
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,180
Today

32
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,620
we are having this little puja

33
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,826
from all the builders

34
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,031
who helped us here,

35
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,499
with the blessings of Vishwakarma

36
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,368
and Brahmadeva;

37
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,718
those who have tried

38
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:43,255
to make this house so beautiful.

39
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,315
Also, as you know, Blake has described this house.

40
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,060
It has a special significance

41
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:54,198
and we have to now

42
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:56,060
hand it over to somebody else,

43
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,700
the one who will appreciate and respect this house;

44
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:04,500
who will understand the value and worth of this house.

45
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,283
And for that we have to pray

46
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,802
that it will be sold to such a person

47
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:13,804
who is a person who will be

48
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:17,807
a connoisseur, a person who will understand

49
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,980
the depth and the

50
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,660
aesthetics

51
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:26,260
of this place

52
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:30,387
and the one who will be paying for that,

53
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,369
valuing that.

54
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,820
So, we have to ask

55
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,700
for such a blessing.

56
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,142
Of course, one should not get attached to anything.

57
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,180
Whatever is created,

58
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:49,364
is created. One should never be attached.

59
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,180
Because we have done this, so

60
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,780
we should be attached to it, is not the way a Sahaja

61
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:56,877
Yogi should think about it.

62
00:06:57,078 --> 00:07:00,162
But one should think about that, 
now we have created something beautiful

63
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:02,140
we can recreate another thing

64
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,283
and we can produce other better things.

65
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:06,780
That’s how an artist

66
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,617
can go on producing and producing.

67
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,100
Of course,

68
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,820
there’s one thing: that if there is

69
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,060
within us the joy,

70
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,013
then only you produce joy.

71
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:25,540
If there is no joy you cannot.

72
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,900
So first of all

73
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,330
before doing any work

74
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:33,191
creating anything

75
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,420
one must measure up

76
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,820
the amount of

77
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,138
joy one has received,

78
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:44,496
the blessings one has received from the Divine,

79
00:07:44,902 --> 00:07:46,500
and then recreate.

80
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,044
With that consciousness, with that awareness

81
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:52,620
you’ll find your creation will be very beautiful.

82
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,109
And we have to bring the world to a new

83
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,620
method of creativity

84
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,460
where there is exuberance,

85
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,580
exuberance,

86
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:08,691
of joy and

87
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:13,300
of Divine aesthetics,

88
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:17,288
because the world is going from bad to worse.

89
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:20,756
I find nowadays people may just like to have

90
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,700
some sort of a white cloth hanging and calling it a painting.

91
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,804
That’s not a painting because there is nothing inside.

92
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:30,660
It has become hollow, empty; there’s nothing inside,

93
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,656
so that there is no exuberance.

94
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,437
So, to recreate that,

95
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,983
you people have to

96
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:39,891
desire and ask for it,

97
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:41,991
and we’ll have people of that kind.

98
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:43,858
It is just to be desired,

99
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,180
and you all should desire for such things:

100
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:49,780
that people of exuberance should come forward

101
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,680
to value such things which are full of joy.

102
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,700
May God bless you.

103
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:05,166
And so what is this, first the Ganesha puja we’ll do?

104
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,264
May God bless you all.

105
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:52,979
May God bless this house.

106
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:56,040
May God bless Mr. Shrivastava.

107
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:53,660
If you eat all these things. I have done such a good cooking!

108
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:56,943
I have to say you shouldn’t eat anything anymore

109
00:55:57,143 --> 00:55:59,647
because if you eat it then I’ll just vibrate it,

110
00:55:59,847 --> 00:56:03,700
but you people don’t eat anything 
now because such a lot has been cooked,

111
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,460
OK?

112
00:56:06,715 --> 00:56:08,519
Such nice food.

113
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:59,199
More than that, ahead of that.

114
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,720
Dhanya: Play it forward

115
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:03,486
Gavin Brown: Yes but tell him.

116
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:07,257
Yogi: Is it before this or after this? Gavin: No after, further on.

117
00:57:11,288 --> 00:57:13,344
Shri Mataji: There’s a nice song

118
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:17,260
which says that, in the love of the bhaktas,

119
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:19,493
how God

120
00:57:19,693 --> 00:57:23,117
does little, little things to please the bhaktas.

121
00:57:24,593 --> 00:57:26,500
And it’s a very good

122
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:28,940
thing which you’ll like it very much;

123
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,620
which were -

124
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:34,540
is to be translated and you can…

125
00:57:38,113 --> 00:57:41,140
You see, this is the one but start it from the. And he says:

126
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,420
God thinks that let my,

127
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:47,189
my respect may be less, doesn’t matter

128
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,140
but I cannot,

129
00:57:53,144 --> 00:57:57,144
I cannot let down my disciples. I may have to come down

130
00:57:57,645 --> 00:58:00,411
but I cannot let down my disciples,

131
00:58:00,612 --> 00:58:02,380
my people who are

132
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,363
my bhaktas.

133
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,540
Just little, just bring it,

134
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,300
I can’t hear it properly.

135
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,093
There’s a switch there.

136
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:21,220
Begin it again, I’ll tell you meaning.

137
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:27,940
Bring it here. It’s a very interesting. Come forward!

138
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:32,260
Till they prepare for your food down below.

139
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:34,961
You see it will take half an hour at least.

140
00:58:40,193 --> 00:58:42,420
Come forward! Come! Come here! Come here!

141
00:58:43,534 --> 00:58:45,860
Today Mr. Shrivastava has become a Sahaj Yogi!

142
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,760
And he now belongs to our Sahaja Nirmala Dharm so it’s all right.

143
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,250
Sir C.P. Shrivastava: Thank you!

144
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,680
Shri Mataji: We have already
registered ourselves as Vishwa Nirmala Dharm!

145
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:14,780
Start it, start it from this one.

146
00:59:24,259 --> 00:59:25,950
Start it earlier.

147
01:00:19,981 --> 01:00:23,060
Come forward! Come here!

148
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:27,180
You can remove this chair!

149
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,100
This is for the devotees of God,

150
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,153
what He does how far that

151
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:15,502
let His respect

152
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:17,965
be kept.

153
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:23,220
What He does is to give the

154
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:27,740
word of the bhaktas;

155
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,340
not to let down the bhaktas.

156
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:34,260
So He comes down to every level,

157
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,946
just to support,

158
01:01:36,146 --> 01:01:38,860
just to make them feel happy.

159
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,620
To every level;

160
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:43,615
for His devotees.

161
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,142
Put a chair also for Mr. Shrivastava there.

162
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:07,001
He might come.

163
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,199
It’s all right, it’s all right, keep it there.

164
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:12,900
At the back. Keep it there.

165
01:02:16,756 --> 01:02:18,860
This is a nice one.

166
01:02:23,223 --> 01:02:25,060
This is just the

167
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:27,845
notes.

168
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:37,940
The force of great love of His devotees,

169
01:02:38,768 --> 01:02:41,740
palay (पलाय)is a word entrapped by that:

170
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,620
love of the devotees.

171
01:02:49,857 --> 01:02:52,180
God has to change His laws,

172
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,257
God has to change His laws,

173
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:02,491
in the force of love of God.

174
01:03:04,892 --> 01:03:06,691
This is Mahamaya!

175
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:12,300
God changes His laws with the force

176
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,780
of the love of His devotees.

177
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:18,140
Whether people respect or not,

178
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,414
whether His respect is challenged or not,

179
01:03:25,929 --> 01:03:29,220
But the Man of the bhaktas in the respect of the bhaktas

180
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,100
He knows that he should not be let down.

181
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:35,140
Disciples,

182
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,000
or you can call them the devotees.

183
01:03:40,053 --> 01:03:43,100
Now he describes how Shri Krishna has done it

184
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,600
or the God has done it:

185
01:03:55,442 --> 01:03:58,500
By only a glance of the grace

186
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:01,820
the whole universe is

187
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:05,900
sustained: means one glance

188
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,000
of the grace of that God.

189
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,840
And such a God we have seen Him in Gokul,

190
01:04:22,508 --> 01:04:24,416
dancing over,

191
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:29,820
asking for the butter.

192
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:32,630
Just imagine! For Him the whole world

193
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:35,313
He nourishes, but here it is He is just

194
01:04:35,514 --> 01:04:37,502
crying for butter, in Gokul,

195
01:04:37,702 --> 01:04:40,100
just to please His Mother.

196
01:05:05,363 --> 01:05:07,035
The one whom,

197
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:11,897
Shambu is Mahadeva,

198
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,082
Viranchi is the Brahmadeva.

199
01:05:15,282 --> 01:05:17,263
All the devas,

200
01:05:17,464 --> 01:05:20,860
Sanaka is the one, Sanak is the very great, high,

201
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,287
spiritually evolved personality,

202
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:28,620
could not get into meditation towards him,

203
01:05:30,037 --> 01:05:33,980
and he is playing here with the little boys

204
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:37,780
who are ordinary

205
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,755
cowherds.

206
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:45,880
See what do you calling them? Cowboys?

207
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,340
The ones that look after, the little, little boys.

208
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,935
We saw him playing with him there.

209
01:05:51,136 --> 01:05:53,140
Here the one who cannot

210
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,709
even meditate,

211
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:58,994
Viranchi is Brahmadeva,

212
01:05:59,194 --> 01:06:01,460
Shambu is Mahadeva:

213
01:06:02,765 --> 01:06:05,740
They cannot even get into meditate:

214
01:06:06,151 --> 01:06:09,060
Suresh, Ganesh, Mahesh and everybody.

215
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:16,189
They think of God but they cannot go beyond.

216
01:06:18,027 --> 01:06:20,431
But here He is,

217
01:06:20,632 --> 01:06:23,969
He’s being driven mad

218
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:26,679
by a few gopis who have some

219
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:29,338
little buttermilk to offer to Him.

220
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:39,311
Very good poetry!

221
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:54,323
The feet of,

222
01:06:54,524 --> 01:06:56,540
whose feet are under the,

223
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,420
under the guidance of Kamala, means the Lakshmi:

224
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,420
She is the one who is holding His feet while sitting down.

225
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:04,900
He can’t get out of it.

226
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:13,037
He cannot take out His feet out of Her powers.

227
01:07:23,821 --> 01:07:26,077
The one who is even looked after

228
01:07:26,278 --> 01:07:28,222
Shri Lakshmi, you see,

229
01:07:28,683 --> 01:07:30,580
such a Person,

230
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:47,196
such a God,

231
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:50,660
have seen His feet walking on the

232
01:07:54,213 --> 01:07:57,073
thorns of the

233
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:01,500
Gokul. Where he was walking there were thorns; in His bare feet,

234
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,229
He was walking there. Such a God,

235
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,186
who’s feet are pressed even by Shri Lakshmi,

236
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:11,140
for his bhaktas, because they were all his bhaktas there.

237
01:08:12,231 --> 01:08:14,380
Like me in London!

238
01:08:28,257 --> 01:08:31,940
By only a little

239
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:35,020
turning of the

240
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,780
eyebrows, you see little one of His,

241
01:08:42,086 --> 01:08:45,580
bending of eyebrows, what do you call this type of a thing?

242
01:08:49,244 --> 01:08:51,420
So seven,

243
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:53,992
seven seas

244
01:08:54,192 --> 01:08:57,192
start boiling, only one is raised.

245
01:09:00,742 --> 01:09:03,821
Then he describes, Bindu is the poet,

246
01:09:04,021 --> 01:09:06,700
he describes such a great poet.

247
01:09:09,469 --> 01:09:11,541
Such a great power

248
01:09:11,741 --> 01:09:14,060
of God that just lifting one

249
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:19,380
eyebrows he makes seven seas to boil.

250
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:24,356
Aap aye, aap aye. (Please come, please come).

251
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:32,769
There He, with the Mother Yeshoda’s fear,

252
01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:36,140
He drops the little drops

253
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,220
of tears.

254
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,780
Shri Mataji: Bindu's?

255
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,879
Mr CP Shrivastava: Drops.

256
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:03,010
Shri Mataji: His name is also ‘drop’, so he puts it that way.

257
01:10:05,398 --> 01:10:07,940
From his eyes He drops

258
01:10:08,843 --> 01:10:10,780
the little, little drops of

259
01:10:12,589 --> 01:10:14,139
‘bindu’.

260
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:19,551
So from where to where? He can make seven

261
01:10:20,937 --> 01:10:24,580
seas to boil and here, there are tear drops,

262
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:28,140
just like bindus from His eyes,

263
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:30,980
just to please His Mother.

264
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,220
Just go and ask Danya, she brought a very good article

265
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:29,437
and something from Kahlil Gibran.

266
01:20:17,535 --> 01:20:19,995
‘Chadariya’ is this body.

267
01:20:31,299 --> 01:20:34,710
Which he has woven, because was a himself, Kabira,

268
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:36,191
was a weaver.

269
01:20:36,392 --> 01:20:38,380
So he describes weaving;

270
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,380
that, this body was woven.

271
01:20:42,962 --> 01:20:45,780
‘Bini’ means woven.

272
01:21:13,185 --> 01:21:17,185
‘In the name of Rama I have made this body’.

273
01:21:17,947 --> 01:21:20,747
He was a Ram bhakta.

274
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:25,130
Yogi: Do you want us to massage your feet or something?

275
01:21:26,141 --> 01:21:28,060
Shri Mataji: You can just bring some ice.

276
01:21:31,752 --> 01:21:35,540
Get one little towel and put some ice

277
01:21:36,754 --> 01:21:40,515
and then break it, then you have to also rub it with that.

278
01:21:54,797 --> 01:21:57,688
He says, “This body is a sheath

279
01:21:59,063 --> 01:22:02,251
in the form of this body.”

280
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:08,491
There are eight

281
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,820
lotuses that is it,

282
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,635
chakras,

283
01:22:16,162 --> 01:22:19,496
and five elements.

284
01:22:20,055 --> 01:22:23,380
Chakka is the one which you spin it,

285
01:22:24,157 --> 01:22:28,100
made out of eight lotuses, means eight chakras

286
01:22:29,273 --> 01:22:31,580
and five elements together.

287
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:35,140
Then that’s how it was woven

288
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:38,660
with nine to ten months.

289
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:45,620
But the stupid have spoiled it.

290
01:23:10,414 --> 01:23:13,100
When my sheet came,

291
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,720
brought in the house

292
01:23:17,879 --> 01:23:20,220
- I mean he is describing his guru

293
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:24,420
as the person who gives the colour

294
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,620
to the sheet.

295
01:24:43,064 --> 01:24:46,340
After wearing this coloured

296
01:24:49,227 --> 01:24:51,241
sheet, you should not

297
01:24:51,441 --> 01:24:54,526
get into doubts about the guru.

298
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:58,687
The one who has given you the colour, you should not doubt that.

299
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08,318
Don’t think this body is yours.

300
01:25:10,682 --> 01:25:12,682
The guru has coloured it.

301
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:21,380
He’s given you for two days only.

302
01:25:27,174 --> 01:25:29,151
Should not doubt.

303
01:25:35,906 --> 01:25:37,503
The stupid,

304
01:25:37,704 --> 01:25:39,980
those who do not know the secret.

305
01:25:43,851 --> 01:25:47,300
Every day they go on spoiling this sheet

306
01:25:48,493 --> 01:25:50,493
– that are stupid!

307
01:25:56,894 --> 01:25:59,628
Kabira knew only one or two abuses,

308
01:26:00,242 --> 01:26:02,212
one was ‘stupid’!

309
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,593
This is Raag Desh.

310
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:25,340
He said,

311
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:29,540
“Poor Prahlad and Sudama, they also got the same body.”

312
01:26:37,104 --> 01:26:38,810
Kedar hai.

313
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:32,780
All right?

314
01:27:33,636 --> 01:27:36,002
Are you feeling alright in the hands?

315
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:39,087
Mark Beaven: Yes, Mother, little warm.

316
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:03,211
Shri Mataji: Gavin?

317
01:28:04,457 --> 01:28:06,497
This is Malkauns Raag.

318
01:28:14,617 --> 01:28:17,180
You must send prasad to all the ashrams.

319
01:28:17,794 --> 01:28:19,340
All right?

320
01:29:08,189 --> 01:29:10,159
Pay attention here.

321
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,060
No, no. Paul, just see here.

322
01:30:30,695 --> 01:30:32,299
Better.

323
01:33:18,182 --> 01:33:19,682
Eyes also.

324
01:33:21,057 --> 01:33:23,340
Do it a little bit with the eyes, pressure it.

325
01:33:35,305 --> 01:33:36,906
See, it’s better.

326
01:33:37,861 --> 01:33:39,490
Pressure on the eyes.

327
01:34:58,628 --> 01:35:00,460
Take a bandhan

328
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,660
and raise your Kundalinis.

329
01:35:03,336 --> 01:35:05,036
Take a bandhan.

330
01:35:08,919 --> 01:35:10,585
First take a bandhan I think.

331
01:35:10,785 --> 01:35:13,501
First take a bandhan then raise the Kundalini.

332
01:36:28,967 --> 01:36:31,780
Give a bandhan to this house to see people.

333
01:36:53,304 --> 01:36:55,120
Aah, done!

334
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,040
Now see.

335
01:36:58,398 --> 01:37:00,232
See on CP’s head also.

336
01:37:11,304 --> 01:37:12,804
There?

337
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,617
Tie it up!

338
01:38:39,608 --> 01:38:41,180
This is the

339
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:44,020
song of the Goddess, those who come at the feet

340
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,128
of you Mother.

341
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:22,300
“The person who gets place in this world

342
01:39:22,549 --> 01:39:24,700
the one who comes at your feet.

343
01:39:31,914 --> 01:39:34,032
This is Saraswati’s bandana.”

344
01:39:43,401 --> 01:39:45,220
Should we come down?

345
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,922
Food is ready?

346
01:39:49,863 --> 01:39:51,963
Accha let’s just finish then.

347
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:57,412
“I am completely surrendered. My heart is surrendered,

348
01:39:57,613 --> 01:40:00,100
my throat is surrendered,

349
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:02,127
my voice is surrendered.

350
01:40:08,554 --> 01:40:10,660
Shraddha is devotion,

351
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:14,700
all emotions, everything surrendered to you.“

352
01:40:20,361 --> 01:40:23,361
Surprising, only to the Mother they ask for blessings.

353
01:40:31,828 --> 01:40:33,686
This is Saraswati bandhana.

354
01:41:09,609 --> 01:41:11,980
In India ‘sang’ means

355
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:14,460
‘holy’ and ‘geet’ is the ‘music’.

356
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:17,900
So the, nothing is higher than holy music,

357
01:41:19,342 --> 01:41:21,015
divine music.

358
01:41:37,201 --> 01:41:40,580
“When the ocean of notes starts calling you,

359
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:44,460
then Sahaj you fill them up

360
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:46,495
with Godliness.”

361
01:42:07,857 --> 01:42:09,763
“She’s the veena player.

362
01:42:09,964 --> 01:42:11,991
She gives us the blessings.”

363
01:42:37,043 --> 01:42:40,044
“Gives eternal music ‘shaswati’ ”

364
01:42:56,131 --> 01:42:57,977
“And get the new life.

365
01:42:58,177 --> 01:43:01,100
When you get blessings, one gets the new life.”

366
01:43:25,619 --> 01:43:29,060
“Sahaja swayam bhagavan mile” “To them, Sahaja,

367
01:43:30,321 --> 01:43:34,218
God, means sakshat, they see the sakshat of God,

368
01:43:35,019 --> 01:43:36,691
in person.

369
01:43:36,892 --> 01:43:38,405
For such people.”

370
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,717
Chalo, let’s go and have food.

371
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:44,328
You are the host CP you better call them!
