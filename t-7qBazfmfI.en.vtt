WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:10.587
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

00:11.213 --> 00:15.213
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

00:17.796 --> 00:21.171
For example, today is Wednesday

00:21.587 --> 00:24.587
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

00:25.587 --> 00:28.129
because I was born on Wednesday.

00:28.962 --> 00:32.962
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

00:33.046 --> 00:35.046
we’ll be able to manage it

00:35.088 --> 00:37.088
because I was born at twelve.

00:37.587 --> 00:40.587
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

00:41.004 --> 00:46.004
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.587
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

00:48.587 --> 00:51.796
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

00:52.046 --> 00:57.754
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

00:57.879 --> 01:00.004
that you all are ready for a Puja

01:00.046 --> 01:05.712
and that we could break this rule also,

01:05.754 --> 01:09.088
after such a long time,

01:09.088 --> 01:15.587
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

01:15.587 --> 01:17.171
I was trying, trying, trying

01:17.213 --> 01:20.629
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

01:26.587 --> 01:31.587
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

01:32.587 --> 01:38.004
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

01:39.921 --> 01:44.921
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

01:46.587 --> 01:48.587
and I don’t know how far

01:48.587 --> 01:52.587
I can go with the description of this great country

01:52.962 --> 01:55.962
which we call as Greece.

01:57.587 --> 02:06.129
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

02:06.587 --> 02:11.962
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

02:12.587 --> 02:15.046
and a “dweep” is a island.

02:15.046 --> 02:20.004
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

02:20.171 --> 02:25.046
and there is a temple of Athena,

02:25.587 --> 02:31.921
all been described about Her temple, about Her

02:34.837 --> 02:37.837
jewelry, dress and everything.

02:38.670 --> 02:42.670
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

02:42.837 --> 02:46.837
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

02:47.754 --> 02:51.046
So now, one may say that,

02:51.046 --> 02:53.296
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

02:53.587 --> 02:56.587
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

02:57.171 --> 02:59.587
One may ask a question like that,

02:59.587 --> 03:06.587
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

03:07.587 --> 03:13.587
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

03:16.004 --> 03:21.004
before the Creation was created in the material form,

03:21.962 --> 03:24.962
where it was planned,

03:27.587 --> 03:31.171
then there was something of the –

03:31.587 --> 03:33.587
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

03:35.587 --> 03:43.088
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

03:44.629 --> 03:50.004
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

03:50.587 --> 03:59.670
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

04:00.254 --> 04:05.921
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

04:05.962 --> 04:08.962
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

04:08.962 --> 04:11.254
and create vibrations there.

04:12.004 --> 04:16.254
Now in the material form the Gokul was

04:16.254 --> 04:19.879
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

04:21.921 --> 04:28.796
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

04:29.754 --> 04:35.629
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

04:35.879 --> 04:40.296
in this area, to create the vibrations.

04:40.754 --> 04:43.213
So it is not only She was a Goddess

04:43.879 --> 04:46.171
but She lived in this area

04:46.587 --> 04:49.587
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

04:50.171 --> 04:57.171
to create the universal

04:58.129 --> 05:03.129
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

05:03.171 --> 05:10.171
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

05:12.046 --> 05:19.046
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

05:20.587 --> 05:23.587
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

05:24.587 --> 05:29.213
and the Mahalakshmi has got

05:29.587 --> 05:32.587
for the redemption, for the awakening.

05:33.171 --> 05:37.837
But the Adi Shakti’s work

05:37.837 --> 05:40.837
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

05:43.129 --> 05:46.296
and to integrate all those qualities,

05:46.587 --> 05:51.587
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

05:51.587 --> 05:56.213
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

05:56.796 --> 05:59.796
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

06:00.587 --> 06:02.587
But as it is,

06:03.629 --> 06:05.837
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

06:05.837 --> 06:08.837
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

06:08.879 --> 06:11.879
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

06:13.587 --> 06:14.921
And this is the…

06:14.962 --> 06:17.171
where She created the Devaloka.

06:18.213 --> 06:22.587
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

06:23.004 --> 06:25.587
Like She created Indra –

06:25.837 --> 06:28.962
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

06:28.962 --> 06:33.962
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

06:34.587 --> 06:37.587
Devaloka was created on this side,

06:39.004 --> 06:42.796
and ganas and all these people were created

06:42.796 --> 06:47.254
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

06:53.587 --> 06:57.587
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

06:57.921 --> 07:04.004
in such a condition when people were really,

07:04.046 --> 07:07.837
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

07:07.837 --> 07:09.837
they could not understand Him,

07:09.879 --> 07:12.879
they could not understand Socrates at all

07:12.879 --> 07:18.046
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

07:18.046 --> 07:22.046
by the people who were surrounding Him,

07:22.837 --> 07:26.837
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

07:26.837 --> 07:30.088
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

07:30.088 --> 07:34.587
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

07:34.796 --> 07:40.171
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

07:40.587 --> 07:43.587
and they started their own theories, own styles,

07:43.587 --> 07:46.587
and that’s how we find the accent from

07:46.587 --> 07:50.587
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

07:51.004 --> 07:55.921
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

07:55.921 --> 07:59.921
So the attention was moved from philosophy

07:59.962 --> 08:02.962
to economics today,

08:02.962 --> 08:08.213
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

08:08.254 --> 08:12.962
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

08:13.004 --> 08:20.837
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

08:20.879 --> 08:26.879
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

08:28.962 --> 08:32.921
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

08:32.962 --> 08:34.587
Abraham had different problems.

08:34.587 --> 08:39.670
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

08:39.670 --> 08:42.171
who were  really very, very ignorant,

08:42.587 --> 08:47.004
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

08:47.587 --> 08:51.796
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

08:51.837 --> 08:53.587
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

08:53.587 --> 08:56.296
and if you read Bible, in the –

08:56.587 --> 09:01.004
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

09:01.213 --> 09:09.004
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

09:09.088 --> 09:13.754
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

09:13.879 --> 09:17.879
to make the people follow religion precisely.

09:18.587 --> 09:22.213
So He did not argue, He did not say

09:22.629 --> 09:25.962
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

09:26.088 --> 09:29.088
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

09:29.129 --> 09:32.712
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

09:33.004 --> 09:39.254
that you understand this or

09:39.837 --> 09:42.213
that you see the point;

09:42.587 --> 09:44.004
He could not do that way.

09:44.587 --> 09:48.213
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

09:48.587 --> 09:51.796
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

09:51.796 --> 09:54.796
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

09:56.004 --> 09:59.004
Because the people were of that type.

09:59.837 --> 10:02.670
Now then you see how gradually,

10:02.712 --> 10:06.670
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

10:06.754 --> 10:08.754
they were a much better people

10:08.879 --> 10:12.879
so He could talk to them about something

10:14.837 --> 10:19.837
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

10:19.837 --> 10:21.837
Of so many things He talked,

10:21.837 --> 10:25.004
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

10:26.587 --> 10:29.587
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.587
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

10:33.213 --> 10:37.213
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

10:38.171 --> 10:42.171
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

10:42.587 --> 10:46.962
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

10:47.587 --> 10:51.129
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

10:51.629 --> 10:56.254
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

10:56.629 --> 11:00.712
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

11:00.754 --> 11:03.213
and the relationships were building up,

11:03.587 --> 11:06.754
and He tried to work it on that level.

11:06.879 --> 11:11.879
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

11:12.796 --> 11:16.587
They evolved but still very ignorant.

11:16.837 --> 11:19.046
So they evolved to this point

11:19.129 --> 11:22.962
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

11:23.004 --> 11:28.171
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

11:28.587 --> 11:31.921
taking their freedom, getting out from there

11:31.921 --> 11:39.587
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

11:41.129 --> 11:43.129
But when they did that,

11:43.171 --> 11:46.171
He found these people on the way –

11:46.171 --> 11:49.921
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

11:49.962 --> 11:52.962
when He came back – what He finds…

12:16.754 --> 12:21.213
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

12:21.712 --> 12:26.921
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

12:27.587 --> 12:32.004
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

12:32.004 --> 12:35.004
extremely immoral character.

12:35.046 --> 12:40.587
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

12:40.587 --> 12:43.921
that nobody can believe that anybody

12:43.921 --> 12:46.754
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

12:46.796 --> 12:48.962
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

12:49.921 --> 12:55.213
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

12:55.796 --> 13:03.796
Now then came the time when people were…

13:05.879 --> 13:10.587
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

13:10.712 --> 13:12.712
we can say at the time of Christ,

13:13.587 --> 13:16.046
but they were not so immoral;

13:16.754 --> 13:19.213
they also could not understand Christ.

13:20.004 --> 13:25.004
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

13:25.004 --> 13:27.587
the human awareness evolving,

13:27.712 --> 13:33.796
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

13:34.254 --> 13:37.254
and you could not talk to them.

13:39.587 --> 13:43.004
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

13:43.587 --> 13:46.213
When the circumstances are such,

13:46.921 --> 13:50.587
like at the time of, say Moses,

13:51.129 --> 13:54.129
that people are extremely immoral,

13:54.129 --> 13:57.129
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

13:58.587 --> 14:03.046
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

14:04.712 --> 14:09.712
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

14:10.587 --> 14:13.587
because they were so left-sided:

14:13.837 --> 14:17.796
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

14:17.796 --> 14:21.587
and say that, “If you do like this,

14:21.587 --> 14:24.587
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

14:24.962 --> 14:26.962
So they took to violence.

14:28.587 --> 14:34.587
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

14:35.629 --> 14:39.629
also the awareness of human beings.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.754
So many things worked it out.

14:43.712 --> 14:47.712
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

14:48.046 --> 14:56.754
her job was to create a integrated force

15:00.088 --> 15:07.837
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

15:08.171 --> 15:16.171
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

15:17.629 --> 15:24.629
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

15:28.879 --> 15:31.879
You have to integrate people

15:33.712 --> 15:36.712
which are left-sided and right-sided.

15:38.879 --> 15:42.587
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

15:42.629 --> 15:45.587
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

15:45.587 --> 15:48.712
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

15:50.587 --> 15:57.587
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

15:58.629 --> 16:04.879
and despite that they resisted him

16:04.879 --> 16:07.879
because they were given this special capacity.

16:09.088 --> 16:12.088
Something with Greeks, they went to…

16:12.088 --> 16:15.088
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

16:15.962 --> 16:20.921
who tried to invade India,

16:21.754 --> 16:24.796
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

16:25.962 --> 16:28.254
You see it’s a Greek nature

16:28.712 --> 16:31.962
that they can go so far and then not,

16:32.962 --> 16:35.962
because they have an integrating force.

16:36.254 --> 16:40.213
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

16:41.004 --> 16:45.754
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

16:46.587 --> 16:50.046
So this power of receding back

16:50.879 --> 16:54.587
is the integrating power,

16:55.587 --> 16:57.712
by you integrate within yourself

16:57.712 --> 17:02.712
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

17:02.754 --> 17:05.088
and you see now that’s alright.

17:06.088 --> 17:08.088
If you have to be in the centre

17:08.129 --> 17:11.129
we should go up to a point and come back.

17:12.046 --> 17:17.004
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

17:17.587 --> 17:19.587
If you take their shipping,

17:19.754 --> 17:23.088
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

17:23.171 --> 17:25.296
extremely aggressive people,

17:25.587 --> 17:29.296
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

17:29.587 --> 17:31.587
They were not very law-abiding

17:31.587 --> 17:34.171
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

17:34.213 --> 17:39.046
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

17:39.088 --> 17:44.712
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

17:44.712 --> 17:49.754
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

17:51.088 --> 17:55.088
So perhaps, perhaps,

17:55.587 --> 17:59.088
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

17:59.296 --> 18:02.296
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

18:03.088 --> 18:06.670
Then when the shipping went down –

18:06.712 --> 18:10.171
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

18:10.587 --> 18:12.587
they sunk their ships

18:14.088 --> 18:18.088
and got the money out of insurance.

18:23.587 --> 18:28.587
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

18:28.670 --> 18:33.837
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

18:34.129 --> 18:36.629
they know that how far to go.

18:36.796 --> 18:40.254
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

18:40.879 --> 18:43.712
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

18:43.712 --> 18:47.754
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

18:47.754 --> 18:51.213
Alright. He married her up to a point,

18:51.587 --> 18:54.670
but most of his property went to his daughter,

18:54.670 --> 18:56.670
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

18:57.921 --> 19:04.171
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

19:04.171 --> 19:07.879
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

19:07.921 --> 19:09.796
like Americans are.

19:09.837 --> 19:13.004
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

19:13.129 --> 19:15.129
but Greeks can never become idiots,

19:15.171 --> 19:17.171
whatever you may try.

19:18.587 --> 19:21.213
They are very sharp and very intelligent

19:22.088 --> 19:25.088
but they know how far to go with everything.

19:26.129 --> 19:29.129
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

19:30.171 --> 19:34.046
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

19:34.046 --> 19:37.046
and She created Ganesha here.

19:37.879 --> 19:41.171
And the balance of the universe,

19:41.171 --> 19:45.004
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

19:45.046 --> 19:49.629
and so the people over here are very balanced.

19:50.921 --> 19:55.796
You can find them very…

19:55.921 --> 20:00.796
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

20:01.088 --> 20:04.088
One may say because they are traditional people,

20:04.129 --> 20:06.129
they have long traditions.

20:06.587 --> 20:09.587
But Egypt had also long traditions.

20:10.213 --> 20:13.088
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

20:13.129 --> 20:17.004
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

20:17.254 --> 20:22.254
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

20:23.837 --> 20:26.837
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

20:27.587 --> 20:33.587
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

20:34.587 --> 20:36.921
but they are not like Indians.

20:38.879 --> 20:42.879
So what is lacking in all these people is

20:43.879 --> 20:47.879
the depth of awareness

20:48.796 --> 20:54.962
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

20:55.254 --> 21:02.213
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

21:03.213 --> 21:08.962
and China rose also, afterwards,

21:09.088 --> 21:12.088
into her own glory

21:12.629 --> 21:18.129
and became quite a good industrial,

21:18.587 --> 21:22.004
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

21:23.254 --> 21:28.879
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

21:28.879 --> 21:31.629
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

21:32.129 --> 21:33.921
Do you know last…

21:33.921 --> 21:36.879
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

21:36.879 --> 21:40.837
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

21:40.879 --> 21:43.670
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

21:43.670 --> 21:50.670
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

21:51.587 --> 21:54.129
and you see what’s happening in China.

21:56.004 --> 21:59.004
So the effects of these

22:03.587 --> 22:08.171
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

22:08.879 --> 22:12.879
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

22:13.796 --> 22:15.754
Now you may say that,

22:15.796 --> 22:19.796
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

22:21.088 --> 22:26.629
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

22:26.879 --> 22:30.046
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

22:30.171 --> 22:33.796
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

22:33.837 --> 22:36.962
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

22:36.962 --> 22:41.921
so I thought that let Greeks

22:43.046 --> 22:46.754
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

22:47.837 --> 22:51.213
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

22:51.587 --> 22:57.629
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

22:59.004 --> 23:04.796
because actually, at the time

23:04.837 --> 23:07.004
when Athena came here,

23:07.046 --> 23:11.171
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

23:11.921 --> 23:17.171
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.213
So now to bring Himalaya here,

23:20.712 --> 23:25.587
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

23:26.879 --> 23:29.213
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

23:29.879 --> 23:33.171
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

23:33.670 --> 23:40.587
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

23:40.587 --> 23:42.796
most unorthodox,

23:43.921 --> 23:47.254
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

23:49.879 --> 23:54.587
So we have a problem, big problem,

23:55.171 --> 23:58.171
how we’ll establish here.

24:00.587 --> 24:04.837
The Devaloka was formed here

24:05.004 --> 24:09.004
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

24:09.587 --> 24:14.004
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

24:15.004 --> 24:20.004
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

24:20.004 --> 24:27.088
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

24:27.587 --> 24:34.754
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

24:35.921 --> 24:41.921
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

24:44.587 --> 24:47.837
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

24:48.088 --> 24:51.088
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

24:51.129 --> 24:55.129
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

24:56.129 --> 24:59.670
And that is responsible for the downfall

24:59.712 --> 25:03.754
because this part of the country

25:05.921 --> 25:10.921
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

25:12.171 --> 25:19.088
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

25:19.754 --> 25:25.796
we see it has become just the opposite

25:26.837 --> 25:33.962
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

25:34.004 --> 25:36.962
to such degrading things.

25:37.712 --> 25:44.046
Even in the mythology also, in India

25:44.629 --> 25:50.129
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

25:51.046 --> 25:56.796
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

25:57.587 --> 26:05.712
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

26:07.004 --> 26:13.962
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

26:14.088 --> 26:19.629
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

26:19.629 --> 26:24.921
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

26:25.046 --> 26:30.088
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

26:30.587 --> 26:35.046
and from here Indra went down

26:36.088 --> 26:39.088
and took away the wife.

26:40.088 --> 26:44.088
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

26:45.129 --> 26:48.046
and Indra went down,

26:48.088 --> 26:52.088
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

26:52.088 --> 26:56.088
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

26:57.587 --> 27:01.004
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

27:02.171 --> 27:05.712
So now the… see how the combinations are,

27:05.754 --> 27:13.088
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

27:13.088 --> 27:16.088
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

27:17.129 --> 27:20.629
it was in his ashram He stayed.

27:22.088 --> 27:25.296
So the Muni Shandilya told

27:26.046 --> 27:29.587
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

27:29.587 --> 27:35.088
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

27:35.629 --> 27:42.629
who will, by his own devotion,

27:43.088 --> 27:47.088
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

27:47.712 --> 27:54.213
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

27:55.670 --> 27:58.171
and He will kill this asura.

27:58.670 --> 28:03.670
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

28:03.670 --> 28:07.670
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

28:09.129 --> 28:11.213
So this Narasimha came

28:11.254 --> 28:17.088
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

28:17.962 --> 28:20.962
little boy played there around and he made some

28:21.046 --> 28:26.046
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

28:26.254 --> 28:31.171
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

28:31.587 --> 28:33.629
That was made by Prahlad,

28:33.754 --> 28:37.129
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

28:37.296 --> 28:40.629
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

28:40.837 --> 28:44.587
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

28:44.921 --> 28:47.796
So see the relationship, how it is.

28:48.129 --> 28:53.046
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

28:53.670 --> 29:01.088
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

29:01.796 --> 29:08.754
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

29:09.171 --> 29:15.213
that not any animal can kill him,

29:15.213 --> 29:17.921
not any human being can kill him,

29:17.921 --> 29:21.921
not on the land or in the sky,

29:22.670 --> 29:25.587
and not with any weapon –

29:25.587 --> 29:28.587
all so many blessings he had taken!

29:28.587 --> 29:31.296
He had closed all the lines, you see,

29:31.587 --> 29:33.670
so that nobody should kill him,

29:34.587 --> 29:40.129
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

29:41.213 --> 29:45.254
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

29:45.254 --> 29:49.254
is that He became the simha,

29:49.754 --> 29:54.837
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

29:56.004 --> 30:01.254
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

30:01.670 --> 30:04.796
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

30:04.796 --> 30:08.796
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

30:09.587 --> 30:11.921
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

30:12.129 --> 30:15.712
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

30:15.837 --> 30:19.004
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

30:19.004 --> 30:21.004
pillar of stone,

30:21.171 --> 30:25.171
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

30:25.587 --> 30:31.046
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

30:31.712 --> 30:34.046
with long hands and claws,

30:34.171 --> 30:36.837
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

30:37.004 --> 30:42.254
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

30:42.837 --> 30:47.587
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

30:47.837 --> 30:49.962
He opened his stomach and killed him.

30:52.088 --> 30:55.088
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

30:55.088 --> 30:59.754
the people of Egypt made their…

30:59.796 --> 31:03.171
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

31:04.171 --> 31:07.171
they were the ones who were asuras,

31:07.837 --> 31:09.837
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

31:10.587 --> 31:16.587
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

31:17.004 --> 31:20.254
the other way round than Narasimha.

31:22.962 --> 31:28.213
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

31:28.254 --> 31:35.254
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

31:36.837 --> 31:39.879
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

31:42.129 --> 31:48.004
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

31:48.046 --> 31:51.046
because all these devas were Greeks –

31:51.796 --> 31:54.754
and these devas were, like Indra,

31:54.754 --> 31:57.754
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.921
But I think there… because

32:01.962 --> 32:05.796
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

32:06.213 --> 32:12.213
they could not see the proper image of their...

32:13.796 --> 32:19.213
of their...faces in their meditation

32:19.754 --> 32:21.629
because they perverted them

32:21.629 --> 32:24.629
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

32:24.629 --> 32:28.796
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

32:28.796 --> 32:31.587
which was all their own imagination

32:31.587 --> 32:35.712
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

32:35.754 --> 32:41.796
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

32:42.629 --> 32:49.171
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

32:49.629 --> 32:51.837
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

32:51.879 --> 32:55.171
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

32:55.213 --> 33:00.254
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

33:00.254 --> 33:04.254
So they made them more like…

33:05.670 --> 33:08.962
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

33:09.004 --> 33:11.879
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

33:11.879 --> 33:15.088
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

33:15.129 --> 33:17.587
like Varuna, I can tell you.

33:17.587 --> 33:20.754
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

33:20.754 --> 33:23.254
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

33:23.254 --> 33:28.754
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

33:29.587 --> 33:31.796
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

33:31.796 --> 33:34.921
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

33:35.837 --> 33:40.796
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

33:44.587 --> 33:47.629
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

33:47.629 --> 33:50.213
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

33:50.587 --> 33:51.921
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

33:51.921 --> 33:55.712
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

33:57.587 --> 33:59.837
So with such expense they gave it

33:59.879 --> 34:03.712
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

34:04.796 --> 34:07.712
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

34:07.712 --> 34:14.296
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

34:14.921 --> 34:22.796
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

34:23.046 --> 34:27.296
On that history stands the modern Greek.

34:28.629 --> 34:34.088
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

34:34.587 --> 34:36.962
people had evolved we think,

34:37.587 --> 34:40.587
but they also crucified Christ,

34:41.670 --> 34:43.670
so what was their evolution?

34:43.837 --> 34:50.712
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

34:51.046 --> 34:56.046
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

34:57.587 --> 34:59.171
there is much difference

34:59.962 --> 35:04.962
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

35:05.879 --> 35:09.796
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

35:09.796 --> 35:12.921
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

35:13.046 --> 35:17.004
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

35:17.171 --> 35:20.587
But still He was also killed;

35:21.046 --> 35:24.962
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

35:25.213 --> 35:29.629
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

35:29.837 --> 35:33.837
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

35:34.796 --> 35:40.088
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

35:40.670 --> 35:44.213
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

35:44.670 --> 35:50.670
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

35:50.754 --> 35:55.088
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

35:55.587 --> 35:56.712
500 before Christ;

35:57.004 --> 36:02.921
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

36:03.046 --> 36:06.754
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

36:07.088 --> 36:10.046
as because He was Primordial Master.

36:10.921 --> 36:14.921
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

36:16.670 --> 36:20.088
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

36:20.587 --> 36:25.296
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

36:26.171 --> 36:30.088
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

36:30.088 --> 36:34.046
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

36:34.712 --> 36:38.962
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

36:38.962 --> 36:42.962
they would not accept any person,

36:42.962 --> 36:45.879
they would throw away, they would beat people.

36:45.921 --> 36:50.046
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

36:50.088 --> 36:52.796
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

36:52.796 --> 36:54.712
like very harsh people.

36:55.587 --> 36:59.254
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

36:59.254 --> 37:02.587
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

37:02.587 --> 37:05.879
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

37:06.129 --> 37:08.171
See, He saw the point

37:08.837 --> 37:12.213
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

37:12.754 --> 37:14.629
talking in that way.

37:14.629 --> 37:17.796
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

37:17.796 --> 37:20.129
even reason it out like Socrates did,

37:20.587 --> 37:23.921
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

37:24.088 --> 37:27.046
the whole logic system comes from Him,

37:27.879 --> 37:29.879
He’s a master of logic.

37:29.879 --> 37:35.587
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

37:36.088 --> 37:39.754
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

37:39.879 --> 37:44.254
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

37:44.879 --> 37:48.587
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

37:48.754 --> 37:52.004
And Christ understood that there is no logic

37:52.213 --> 37:55.213
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

37:55.921 --> 37:58.629
So He talked to them in parables,

37:59.587 --> 38:01.254
but still they killed Him.

38:02.213 --> 38:07.046
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

38:07.046 --> 38:11.254
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

38:11.879 --> 38:14.879
were very funny, and they did it.

38:16.837 --> 38:22.171
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

38:22.754 --> 38:26.129
I should give Realisation to people first,

38:27.921 --> 38:31.296
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

38:31.754 --> 38:34.587
Now, I’m talking to you everything

38:34.629 --> 38:37.670
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

38:37.670 --> 38:40.670
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

38:41.046 --> 38:45.754
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

38:46.088 --> 38:47.962
and one who are not.

38:47.962 --> 38:52.046
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

38:52.129 --> 38:56.587
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

38:56.712 --> 39:02.921
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

39:02.921 --> 39:06.921
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

39:06.921 --> 39:10.921
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

39:10.962 --> 39:14.587
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

39:14.587 --> 39:19.129
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

39:19.587 --> 39:24.004
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

39:24.046 --> 39:27.088
where collectively you are understanding Me.

39:27.088 --> 39:30.171
The situation is not so bad as that was

39:30.296 --> 39:33.004
even at the time of Christ.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.129
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

39:35.129 --> 39:38.129
He was the only wise man going around.

39:38.587 --> 39:41.088
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

39:41.088 --> 39:44.129
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

39:44.129 --> 39:48.088
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

39:48.670 --> 39:51.796
Both of them, really,

39:52.129 --> 39:55.712
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

39:55.712 --> 39:57.879
which were all absolutely.

39:57.962 --> 40:00.879
But He talked absolutely…

40:00.921 --> 40:05.088
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

40:05.213 --> 40:07.213
and talked so openly.

40:07.796 --> 40:11.004
Then, in the same way, we can say,

40:11.213 --> 40:14.171
the Primordial Master state is that

40:14.629 --> 40:18.004
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

40:19.088 --> 40:23.046
He was also killed because He told the truth.

40:23.587 --> 40:27.171
Then came Nanaka;

40:27.587 --> 40:30.587
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

40:31.004 --> 40:34.879
and the people who really follow Him are just

40:36.088 --> 40:38.004
in the opposite direction.

40:38.004 --> 40:40.587
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

40:40.587 --> 40:43.754
so they are going in that way.

40:43.796 --> 40:47.712
You find even same thing with Christ;

40:47.712 --> 40:52.046
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

40:52.754 --> 40:55.712
Every religion is just the same.

40:55.712 --> 40:58.587
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

40:58.712 --> 41:02.129
Those who preach Gita are just…

41:02.587 --> 41:04.796
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

41:04.837 --> 41:07.670
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

41:07.670 --> 41:10.129
going down, taking people down.

41:10.129 --> 41:13.129
So it is common with all religions

41:14.088 --> 41:18.879
that they have always used the name of prophets

41:19.712 --> 41:26.088
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

41:26.088 --> 41:33.088
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

41:34.088 --> 41:36.587
So, now those who are alert about it,

41:36.587 --> 41:40.629
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

41:42.254 --> 41:44.254
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

41:44.629 --> 41:48.254
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

41:48.837 --> 41:52.837
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

41:53.921 --> 41:56.796
instead of going themselves down.

41:56.837 --> 42:02.670
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

42:02.837 --> 42:06.670
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

42:06.670 --> 42:09.296
If Athena could be awakened here,

42:09.629 --> 42:13.587
this place could be of very great help to us.

42:14.171 --> 42:19.796
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

42:19.796 --> 42:24.587
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

42:24.587 --> 42:30.171
also they have lots of qualities of

42:30.171 --> 42:36.712
understanding the worthlessness of

42:37.004 --> 42:43.670
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

42:43.837 --> 42:46.046
But the immorality grew,

42:46.046 --> 42:49.670
now, because they started copying Westerners;

42:49.837 --> 42:53.088
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

42:53.629 --> 42:57.754
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

42:58.088 --> 43:01.629
Before that the women were very moral,

43:01.629 --> 43:04.088
very good women lived here,

43:04.587 --> 43:09.004
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

43:09.587 --> 43:13.587
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

43:13.629 --> 43:15.962
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

43:15.962 --> 43:18.587
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

43:18.587 --> 43:21.587
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

43:21.587 --> 43:25.213
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

43:25.629 --> 43:29.629
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

43:30.088 --> 43:33.004
They may use a woman who has no character

43:33.004 --> 43:35.213
but they respect the woman who has character

43:35.213 --> 43:37.587
and also respect the mother.

43:37.712 --> 43:41.004
So there are lots of qualities in this country

43:41.046 --> 43:44.670
which are still existing,

43:44.837 --> 43:49.213
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

43:49.629 --> 43:53.629
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

43:53.754 --> 43:59.921
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

43:59.962 --> 44:03.254
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

44:03.796 --> 44:05.837
May God bless you!

44:22.879 --> 44:25.962
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

44:25.962 --> 44:28.879
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

44:41.837 --> 44:45.837
He was very much respected in India, always,

44:46.670 --> 44:49.670
Alexander was very much respected in India,

44:49.921 --> 44:52.921
and because he went away

44:53.629 --> 44:56.629
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

44:57.837 --> 45:02.088
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

45:03.129 --> 45:05.296
I think he got quite detached

45:05.754 --> 45:08.962
after coming to India. Anybody who has

45:08.962 --> 45:13.129
come to invade India, and has really gained something

45:13.129 --> 45:16.254
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

45:16.587 --> 45:19.587
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

45:19.587 --> 45:20.754
three hundred years.

45:20.754 --> 45:23.712
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

45:24.587 --> 45:27.587
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

45:27.962 --> 45:31.629
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

45:31.837 --> 45:33.837
nothing went into their heads.

45:35.754 --> 45:39.296
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

45:39.670 --> 45:42.213
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

45:42.213 --> 45:46.213
So many are there even now living in the forests.

45:47.629 --> 45:52.088
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

45:52.088 --> 45:55.587
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

45:55.796 --> 45:59.004
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

45:59.004 --> 46:02.712
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

46:03.004 --> 46:06.587
who was at the time of Alexander.

46:06.796 --> 46:11.296
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

46:11.670 --> 46:14.796
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

46:14.921 --> 46:17.962
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

46:18.629 --> 46:23.213
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

46:23.587 --> 46:24.754
to England;

46:26.837 --> 46:28.754
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

46:28.754 --> 46:31.754
and the sign of awareness is this, that

46:31.754 --> 46:35.088
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

46:35.921 --> 46:39.921
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

46:40.629 --> 46:44.712
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

46:44.879 --> 46:48.046
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

46:48.046 --> 46:51.837
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

46:51.879 --> 46:53.587
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

46:53.670 --> 46:55.629
so he went back and told his king that,

46:55.629 --> 46:58.754
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

46:58.754 --> 47:00.670
They are not Muslims”.

47:03.046 --> 47:04.629
So simple he was.

47:04.629 --> 47:07.837
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

47:07.837 --> 47:10.754
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

47:11.254 --> 47:12.629
He was a nice man.

47:12.629 --> 47:15.754
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

47:15.754 --> 47:18.171
but still certain respect they showed, like

47:18.587 --> 47:20.962
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

47:21.837 --> 47:23.670
They still call it Mumbai.

47:23.962 --> 47:25.712
many words Mumbai

47:25.837 --> 47:29.962
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

47:30.088 --> 47:32.754
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

47:32.879 --> 47:34.254
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

47:34.712 --> 47:36.712
so they call it Mumbai –

47:36.962 --> 47:38.962
is the name of the Goddess.

47:39.171 --> 47:41.171
So they didn’t want to change it.

47:41.670 --> 47:44.712
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

47:44.879 --> 47:46.837
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

47:46.879 --> 47:49.088
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

47:49.171 --> 47:50.670
I said, “It is.”

47:50.962 --> 47:54.587
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

47:57.962 --> 48:01.088
So you see the… see the awareness,

48:01.088 --> 48:03.754
you can see the awareness of people

48:03.921 --> 48:09.129
because they were so aware about the serenity,

48:09.171 --> 48:12.754
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

48:12.879 --> 48:14.629
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

48:14.629 --> 48:17.171
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

48:17.962 --> 48:21.213
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

48:21.629 --> 48:23.879
But the English could have gone and found out

48:23.879 --> 48:27.754
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

48:27.837 --> 48:29.046
But they did not.

48:29.046 --> 48:32.046
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

48:32.088 --> 48:34.754
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

48:35.254 --> 48:38.254
because, you see, that respect

48:38.796 --> 48:41.129
for serenity and all these things,

48:41.587 --> 48:45.921
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

48:46.004 --> 48:49.879
Now the children of Britain

48:50.088 --> 48:53.629
are better, are very different, very different.

48:53.879 --> 48:57.254
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

48:58.670 --> 49:04.796
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

49:05.796 --> 49:09.796
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

49:10.587 --> 49:11.962
they came with respect.

49:13.171 --> 49:19.129
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

49:20.088 --> 49:22.088
And now, as the time has passed,

49:22.088 --> 49:24.670
I find Britishers have respect for others,

49:25.046 --> 49:28.254
they’re respecting, many.

49:28.254 --> 49:31.712
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

49:31.712 --> 49:35.670
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

49:40.962 --> 49:44.962
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

49:45.296 --> 49:47.796
That is the part lacking in England.

49:47.921 --> 49:51.254
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

49:51.629 --> 49:53.962
then what sort of a heart it must be?

49:54.796 --> 49:57.796
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

50:01.004 --> 50:08.171
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

50:08.712 --> 50:14.754
respecting others, respecting their culture,

50:14.754 --> 50:18.879
respecting their lifestyle.

50:19.129 --> 50:24.629
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

50:24.962 --> 50:28.587
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

50:28.962 --> 50:31.796
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

50:31.962 --> 50:35.171
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

50:35.670 --> 50:38.213
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

50:38.213 --> 50:41.213
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

50:41.879 --> 50:46.712
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

50:46.879 --> 50:50.296
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

50:50.629 --> 50:53.712
So that is there but just theory.

50:53.879 --> 50:57.629
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

50:57.796 --> 51:03.213
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

51:03.587 --> 51:06.587
and fasting for South Africa.

51:08.004 --> 51:10.296
So between the South African awareness

51:10.670 --> 51:14.004
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

51:14.129 --> 51:18.129
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

51:19.088 --> 51:23.921
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

51:24.046 --> 51:27.046
I think it can transform the whole world.

51:27.629 --> 51:31.088
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

51:31.962 --> 51:34.004
It has to be respect.

51:38.837 --> 51:40.962
It is not insulting now,

51:41.171 --> 51:44.629
but it is not positive respect.

51:44.796 --> 51:48.712
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

51:48.712 --> 51:52.296
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

51:52.296 --> 51:55.213
This is what I have been talking about,

51:55.629 --> 51:59.004
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

51:59.837 --> 52:03.962
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

52:04.296 --> 52:06.712
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

52:06.712 --> 52:09.712
because still they have a sense of respect.

52:12.670 --> 52:16.670
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

52:17.879 --> 52:22.046
That part is there, that one has to learn.

52:22.046 --> 52:26.046
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

52:27.129 --> 52:33.129
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

52:33.754 --> 52:36.962
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

52:36.962 --> 52:40.921
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

52:45.921 --> 52:48.296
And respect is something from your heart.

52:48.879 --> 52:52.712
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

52:52.837 --> 52:55.129
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

52:56.088 --> 52:59.879
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

52:59.879 --> 53:03.046
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

53:03.046 --> 53:06.296
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

53:08.879 --> 53:13.129
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

53:13.962 --> 53:17.004
and when that works out then

53:17.004 --> 53:20.712
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

53:20.921 --> 53:25.837
high state of understanding of Divinity.

53:26.088 --> 53:31.088
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

53:31.712 --> 53:35.712
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

53:36.088 --> 53:39.254
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

53:39.254 --> 53:43.254
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

53:43.921 --> 53:46.171
And that it’s not what you get,

53:46.587 --> 53:48.754
it’s not what you have,

53:48.879 --> 53:53.879
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

53:56.962 --> 54:01.004
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

54:01.088 --> 54:03.213
because there’s a big understanding

54:03.213 --> 54:05.296
now between you and the Divine,

54:05.629 --> 54:08.088
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

54:08.171 --> 54:12.171
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

54:13.254 --> 54:17.629
learn that respect, then things will work out.

54:17.670 --> 54:19.796
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

54:19.837 --> 54:23.296
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

54:23.587 --> 54:25.046
May God bless you!
