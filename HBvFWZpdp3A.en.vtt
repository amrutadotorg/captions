00:05:52.281 --> 00:06:01.047
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Lakshmi.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.906
In Diwali, in India,

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:20.068
they worship Lakshmi because

00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:26.854
a great rakshasa called Narakasura was killed.

00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:33.957
Also that Lakshmi came out of the sea,

00:06:38.207 --> 00:06:44.167
at the same time - long time back. I mean, I should say, this is like

00:06:44.387 --> 00:06:49.628
Her different appearances on the same geo region.

00:06:57.027 --> 00:07:05.027
Lakshmi is the Goddess which gives us wealth,

00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:14.159
gives us prosperity. She is very blissful, no doubt.

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:23.634
She gives you protection and also She's very humble,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.546
because She stands on the Lotus. She's very light,

00:07:32.288 --> 00:07:35.796
means does not put her pressure on anyone.

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:41.937
These are symbols of Shri Lakshmi.

00:07:43.256 --> 00:07:49.026
But also She is a part of Mahamaya in the modern times.

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:53.719
When people get Lakshmi - the money -

00:07:54.354 --> 00:07:59.262
they don't understand that She is their Mother also

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:04.480
and She is to be respected.

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:14.941
When this kind of a perverse idea of Shri Lakshmi comes in,

00:08:15.634 --> 00:08:26.345
such countries, such people meet their last end

00:08:27.697 --> 00:08:31.908
and destruction of the worst type comes in.

00:08:35.415 --> 00:08:40.126
So this Lakshmi has to be used with a big balance,

00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:48.040
like standing on a Lotus and not get into the pond, where

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:54.954
there are all kind of creatures to eat you all. You have to stand

00:08:55.329 --> 00:09:00.637
on the Lotus - that means, that you are above

00:09:01.277 --> 00:09:08.894
all the lures of this Maya.

00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:18.285
Also in Sanskrit and in our languages, we call Lakshmi as the Maya.

00:09:19.777 --> 00:09:24.482
If somebody gets lot of money they would say - "He got lot of maya."

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:27.541
Now this maya plays the tricks.

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:36.713
If money, prosperity, was the salvation,

00:09:37.971 --> 00:09:41.565
then there would have been no problems in this world

00:09:42.608 --> 00:09:51.420
because those people who have money always get ruined.

00:09:52.256 --> 00:09:57.670
If they're not ruined, their children, their grandchildren get ruined.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.378
This principle of Lakshmi within us is very dubious

00:10:06.295 --> 00:10:10.910
and the allurement is so much

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:16.324
that people see somebody having a good car these days,

00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:19.837
they think - "Ah, what a man he is!" -

00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:24.009
- in any case he's not going to give you the car.

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:33.665
If somebody is having lots of, what you can call, palaces

00:10:34.602 --> 00:10:42.009
or buildings, people start admiring him! This is Kali Yuga.

00:10:44.148 --> 00:10:48.859
They start admiring, "See - this man is so rich."

00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:57.344
Even clothes, people see you wearing clothes

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.828
which are very good tailored, might be from some designers, say

00:11:07.047 --> 00:11:13.711
- they think no end of that man. For example in England,

00:11:14.305 --> 00:11:19.469
there is another befooling place called Saville Row.

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:22.406
So if you want to buy one suit

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:26.212
you have to pay sometimes three thousand pounds.

00:11:27.039 --> 00:11:32.950
Now people are so stupid, that now if they wear a suit

00:11:33.099 --> 00:11:37.746
from Saville Row, they put the brand outside. "Saville Row"!

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:44.636
All such tomfoolery is going on all over the world.

00:11:45.144 --> 00:11:51.290
The clothes have no meaning, their lifestyle has no meaning,

00:11:52.306 --> 00:11:56.208
ultimately they end up in Swiss Bank.

00:11:57.915 --> 00:12:04.485
The Lakshmi tattwa of Swiss Bank is also now showing its teeth,

00:12:05.313 --> 00:12:11.032
and, if you read what's happening to them,

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:16.219
I mean, they are shaking, they don't know.

00:12:16.672 --> 00:12:20.226
They went to this limit that they took

00:12:20.529 --> 00:12:24.641
the teeth, golden teeth of the Jews.

00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:35.007
I mean, it's going too far, all this tomfoolery has been going on.

00:12:36.257 --> 00:12:40.709
Their military services says - why, who's going to conquer that country?

00:12:41.164 --> 00:12:44.128
Even Napolean didn't do that.

00:12:44.871 --> 00:12:48.808
And they have made big caves to keep their weapons there,

00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:55.831
who's going to attack them, stupid people, suffering from ego.

00:12:57.199 --> 00:13:04.253
But the attack has come; and this attack

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:13.368
is so serious that they might be completely shattered and destroyed.

00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:19.984
Now who falls for this kind of thing, you should see,

00:13:20.172 --> 00:13:23.405
are the people who are crooks,

00:13:25.224 --> 00:13:32.756
who are dishonest, who are absolutely adharmics.

00:13:34.617 --> 00:13:39.888
They can be Mafia-dons, or they can be

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.302
some thugs, some black marketeers, some smugglers.

00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:52.342
So going against the Lakshmi principle are so many done these days.

00:13:52.857 --> 00:13:57.607
One fellow who was thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, because

00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:01.035
he was trying to be very dominating and all that.

00:14:01.597 --> 00:14:06.754
He said, "That's better." I said "Why?" He's doing now smuggling,

00:14:06.996 --> 00:14:13.558
making money out of smuggling and he's become
very rich - according to him.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.621
But it comes to an end and a very tragic, bad end.

00:14:21.324 --> 00:14:25.817
Money is such a lure for human beings

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:34.637
that it kills all sense of decency,

00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:39.199
of higher values, everything.

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:45.840
A brother say, who is very nice and good fellow,

00:14:46.066 --> 00:14:50.611
if he gets money out of proportion by all doing the hanky panky,

00:14:50.898 --> 00:14:55.400
he neglects his mother, father, brother, sisters, everyone.

00:14:55.647 --> 00:14:58.186
So I would say then it comes to that point,

00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:01.990
that Lakshmiji becomes a bhoot then.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.287
And She - all Her blessings become sort of a

00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:13.991
challenge to your dignity.

00:15:16.488 --> 00:15:22.982
Now certain countries, like America - which is

00:15:24.926 --> 00:15:31.059
the area for Shri Krishna, because He's Kubera -

00:15:32.004 --> 00:15:34.637
- they have no money as such, I've seen,

00:15:34.832 --> 00:15:37.800
they are all poor, they are all indebted.

00:15:38.386 --> 00:15:45.323
So many Indians went to America and they can't come to India now

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.988
- "Why?" "We're indebted." "Why are you indebted?"

00:15:49.386 --> 00:15:53.529
"Oh we get everything free now, see the bank gives us loan,

00:15:53.755 --> 00:15:56.693
we can have the best lifestyle."

00:15:58.412 --> 00:16:04.419
So they will have 3 Mercedes - is nothing, 3 Mercedes is nothing,

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:11.498
we should have Rolls Royces, we should have this. For what?

00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:20.396
What do you get out of it?

00:16:22.052 --> 00:16:25.576
Now of course - little bit they are shaken up,

00:16:26.383 --> 00:16:30.446
with the stock exchange and all that nonsense they had started.

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:35.407
All this joke and all these very big,

00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:41.000
I should say, camouflages,

00:16:42.914 --> 00:16:46.844
all now are coming out.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.972
So this is no Lakshmi, because Lakshmi must give you

00:16:51.175 --> 00:16:55.003
dignity, prosperity and respect.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.712
I think Americans understood about it so they became philanthropists,

00:17:01.923 --> 00:17:07.486
means they are giving money to people. Whom did they give money?

00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:11.915
All the names these people took from South

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:21.522
Africa - were all given money by the philanthropists of America.

00:17:21.803 --> 00:17:28.980
What has happened to their wisdom? That 16 year old boy, he went there,

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:34.730
and then all ages went there and made a very big money.

00:17:36.316 --> 00:17:38.847
All this money-making proposition... -

00:17:39.043 --> 00:17:44.816
- can you give some seat to those musicians? [Hindi...]

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:55.190
So what is the matter? If there's a blessing of Lakshmi,

00:18:55.393 --> 00:18:59.652
why a man who gets the blessing of Lakshmi

00:19:00.087 --> 00:19:07.603
becomes so funny, so stupid, and ultimately ends up his life

00:19:08.056 --> 00:19:13.861
that people are not there even to pick up his dead body.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:28.244
What is the difference between money and Lakshmi?

00:19:32.948 --> 00:19:36.073
She gives you money all right, agreed,

00:19:36.401 --> 00:19:40.518
but when She's giving the money what happens to that money

00:19:40.753 --> 00:19:45.081
which comes to you - is a very subtle thing one should understand.

00:19:48.753 --> 00:19:53.628
In India if you give, say hundred rupees to a servant,

00:19:54.057 --> 00:19:57.526
immediately he'll go to drink somewhere.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:04.214
First idea will come, what he should do, he'll go for a drink,

00:20:04.456 --> 00:20:10.041
of the hard ones, I mean, your Vodka is nowhere near that

00:20:10.229 --> 00:20:13.784
- such hard ones they make in India you know,

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.597
it is called as ‘haath bhatti’: means made with hands.

00:20:19.534 --> 00:20:24.339
So in hundred rupees they are willing to go.

00:20:25.034 --> 00:20:30.753
I mean, that means any money you give to them,

00:20:31.434 --> 00:20:34.738
it spoils their life completely.

00:20:37.168 --> 00:20:42.316
Lakshmi has been given, all right, so what happens to this Lakshmi?

00:20:43.871 --> 00:20:50.426
She changes Her form and Her form is so bad

00:20:50.769 --> 00:20:55.137
that you are completely ruined with that.

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:11.330
So now, we have to understand what is the way we can use the Lakshmi.

00:21:16.423 --> 00:21:19.977
Supposing I get money, supposing.

00:21:23.313 --> 00:21:27.102
Then I will go to the market say,

00:21:28.508 --> 00:21:32.712
and I'll see something nice - "Ah, this is

00:21:32.969 --> 00:21:38.626
very good for this Sahaja Yogi."

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:46.149
Or I will say, "This will be very handy for our Ashram".

00:21:48.492 --> 00:21:52.336
Immediately the mind starts working in a very

00:21:52.532 --> 00:21:57.477
socialistic way I should say, not individualistic.

00:21:57.876 --> 00:22:03.258
For example, I went to Rajasthan

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:07.228
and I saw such a lot of sand,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:13.951
just like a big desert, with dunes, everything - and people starving.

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:21.224
So I said, "How to get money to these people?"

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.701
So I said, "Let Me start a factory."

00:22:28.301 --> 00:22:37.488
A factory with the unbreakable glass which they make only in France.

00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:44.097
They make it very cheap and regard it as very cheap thing -

00:22:45.136 --> 00:22:50.284
-not in India. In India if you go to some elite's house

00:22:50.509 --> 00:22:57.540
they'll offer you tea, in these unbreakable things.

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:59.764
They think it's very elite, you know,

00:22:59.936 --> 00:23:03.357
it depends on what you think about what.

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:11.605
They're proud of it. So I said if we make these things in India,

00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:14.514
these poor people - you know, because there is so much sand,

00:23:14.635 --> 00:23:18.174
and the sand is needed by trucks,

00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:24.011
so I will utilise this to make this beautiful factory here.

00:23:24.246 --> 00:23:32.808
And then give them some support to live well.

00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:42.214
Now, when I went to one place called as Warana

00:23:42.739 --> 00:23:45.087
- you all had come also once -

00:23:45.329 --> 00:23:48.769
there's a gentleman who was a disciple of Gandhiji

00:23:49.152 --> 00:23:57.136
and he's organised this Warana company for distributing milk.

00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:01.862
It became so very rich, so very rich, it's a co-operative -

00:24:02.144 --> 00:24:07.914
so he started giving money to all the co-operative
people, those who had laboured there.

00:24:08.186 --> 00:24:11.304
Now this labour had never seen that money.

00:24:11.558 --> 00:24:13.815
So he came to Me, touched My feet and he said:

00:24:14.065 --> 00:24:16.636
"Mother, You tell me now, what should I do?

00:24:16.857 --> 00:24:21.620
I'm so unhappy with the development of this Warna

00:24:21.847 --> 00:24:27.073
because there are prostitutes who have arrived from Bombay.

00:24:27.894 --> 00:24:33.972
There are all kinds of hard drinks which have come from Bombay,

00:24:34.198 --> 00:24:40.948
and these people are smoking like hell, they are taking drugs." "Why?"

00:24:42.206 --> 00:24:48.769
"Yes, wherever there is money the drug goes there.

00:24:50.136 --> 00:24:53.785
And the children are becoming absolutely useless,

00:24:53.972 --> 00:24:59.229
they don't want to study, they will slap their parents."

00:24:59.995 --> 00:25:04.172
So he said, "This was not Gandhiji's idea, now what has happened?"

00:25:08.118 --> 00:25:14.821
He said, "This is a curse of money" and he was crying.

00:25:15.985 --> 00:25:20.094
Now how can Lakshmi become a curse?

00:25:22.446 --> 00:25:29.133
It does, it is in the Nabhi,

00:25:30.297 --> 00:25:33.735
what a central position it has.

00:25:34.844 --> 00:25:42.758
And when this Nabhi starts working

00:25:44.555 --> 00:25:52.548
it is a very remarkable thing, that you feel

00:25:54.469 --> 00:26:01.807
gobbling the food all the time, with this Nabhi.

00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:08.672
I mean, you go on eating, go on eating like mad,

00:26:09.547 --> 00:26:15.195
and then some bhoot comes in to eat also with you, inside the Nabhi.

00:26:16.172 --> 00:26:23.031
Then you can eat so much that

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:30.156
no human beings can eat like that except for the people who are rich.

00:26:32.351 --> 00:26:39.195
Then you start a big science, or what you can call etiquettes.

00:26:41.562 --> 00:26:44.570
I don't want to hurt anybody,

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.250
I mean if you are eating well I don't mind - eat well.

00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:53.572
But the first part is,

00:26:54.142 --> 00:26:57.831
because today is Diwali I'm trying to tell you

00:26:58.384 --> 00:27:01.291
all these interesting stories.

00:27:03.845 --> 00:27:11.767
I went many a times for dinner with French Diplomats.

00:27:12.103 --> 00:27:17.743
My goodness. Now Me and My husband don't drink.

00:27:17.993 --> 00:27:23.037
So 45 minutes they were only discussing what they will have today.

00:27:23.626 --> 00:27:26.347
Then they remembered yesterday they had that,

00:27:26.605 --> 00:27:31.066
the day before they had that, so there should be variety.

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:33.409
So then they came down to something,

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:37.176
not all of them drinking the same, different, different.

00:27:37.855 --> 00:27:42.916
So they came to some point - all right we'll have this,

00:27:43.173 --> 00:27:48.423
but some people asked for something which was not available,

00:27:49.853 --> 00:27:53.479
so they said, "You have to have it" and they shouted at them.

00:27:53.884 --> 00:28:00.624
My goodness, they took 45 minutes to decide
what they are going to drink.

00:28:02.624 --> 00:28:06.696
It's regarded as French etiquettes, I think,

00:28:06.952 --> 00:28:10.599
and we two chief guests, Myself and My husband,

00:28:10.841 --> 00:28:15.956
looking at this man and looking at that woman didn't know what to do

00:28:16.143 --> 00:28:21.485
with these etiquettes, so we were thinking, "Now better go."

00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:24.532
Then it came to food!

00:28:25.376 --> 00:28:32.998
They are so particular: "I like this, and I like that";

00:28:33.264 --> 00:28:36.892
they are worse than Indians, I tell you.

00:28:38.709 --> 00:28:46.201
And they took at least, 80 minutes to decide what they will eat.

00:28:47.913 --> 00:28:53.382
Ultimately they found something nice, each different

00:28:53.944 --> 00:28:58.780
and the restaurant people were trying to pamper their ego,

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:03.436
"oh what a thing you have chosen - this is the best ..wow wow...."

00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:11.179
So they started serving.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.291
The cheese was smelling so awful, I tell you,

00:29:19.854 --> 00:29:23.073
we couldn't bear it, you know, both of us.

00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:28.807
So My husband told them, "Today is Our fasting day, for both of Us."

00:29:31.023 --> 00:29:35.374
He said, "Why is it a fasting day?" "In India we have, you know,

00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:39.437
fasting like this, have to fast, today is ours."

00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:43.444
But I told him, "Here one day you are saying 'today is our fasting',

00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:46.137
but We have to go to so many dinners, what will you do?"

00:29:46.258 --> 00:29:50.235
He said, "Everywhere better to say that We are fasting."

00:29:51.797 --> 00:29:56.235
Such a horrible cheese they brought, and they started boasting

00:29:56.469 --> 00:30:02.742
that they have 200 types of cheese - wow, wow!

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.888
I said, "200 types - of the smelly ones? From where did you get?"

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:19.935
They said, "This is French perfection! See this.

00:30:20.904 --> 00:30:24.146
Y said, "What is this  French perfection!"

00:30:25.205 --> 00:30:28.440
But then, you know, tears came into my eyes

00:30:28.697 --> 00:30:31.690
C.P. said, "Why are you crying?" - "Not crying,

00:30:31.955 --> 00:30:36.463
but I think, what will happen to these people with their cheese

00:30:36.744 --> 00:30:40.885
Where will they go? Evan if they go to  Hell

00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:45.408
They will be thrown away with the smell of the cheese!!"

00:30:54.768 --> 00:30:59.135
Then I read how this cheese came in,

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:06.252
so they said - there was a big snowfall, and they had put some big,

00:31:06.463 --> 00:31:12.557
big containers in a cave, of milk.  And people forgot about it -

00:31:12.783 --> 00:31:15.517
snowfall was there for 20 days, whatever it was,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.275
and they just forgot about it. So after one year

00:31:19.525 --> 00:31:24.335
they got the smell, you see, coming out of it. So they went

00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:28.319
and saw the cheese being formed - can you imagine?

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:32.147
This is the beginning of the end.

00:31:33.015 --> 00:31:37.022
Actually one should never eat anything that is

00:31:37.265 --> 00:31:41.749
kept overnight, normally, but now they have got fridges

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.913
so you can keep it for 2 days, 3 days at the most.

00:31:46.202 --> 00:31:50.640
Like on the ship they keep it. But this I couldn't understand that

00:31:50.858 --> 00:31:57.700
this cheese, which is, they told Me, is very old, I said, "Really"?

00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:01.098
And they sell it by that, what old it is.

00:32:01.372 --> 00:32:05.505
And their wines, if they are say 200 years old,

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.075
it is 200 times more expensive.

00:32:10.075 --> 00:32:14.223
So it's such a bhootish thing to eat all that.

00:32:15.153 --> 00:32:19.754
So when the Lakshmi goes into the hands of bhoots

00:32:20.045 --> 00:32:24.521
on a very less level, I should say, is this,

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:32.920
then it goes into the heads of people who want to exploit money,

00:32:34.545 --> 00:32:41.889
exploit poor people, exploit countries which are down-trodden -

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:46.623
- go on like this collecting money you know, looting, looting, looting.

00:32:48.857 --> 00:32:54.806
When English came to India, we didn't know they used to take bribes.

00:32:55.056 --> 00:33:01.501
On Diwali day if you went there without any present
they say "baksheesh". You must give some present,

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:05.813
and what they liked was our country liquor. I never knew this,

00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:08.454
but later on I came to know because My husband

00:33:08.665 --> 00:33:10.900
became a collector of Meerut

00:33:11.134 --> 00:33:16.165
- and there were bottles of country liquors  kept in that house

00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:19.259
and that house was itself more than a hundred years old.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.998
A long time back it was kept there still, some of them you see,

00:33:24.248 --> 00:33:28.631
and we could have sent them to England to
sell - would have been a good idea.

00:33:28.857 --> 00:33:33.123
So the older it is, it's better.

00:33:34.803 --> 00:33:40.365
This Lakshmi I think becomes old and dies and there is A-Lakshmi.

00:33:40.943 --> 00:33:45.647
A-Lakshmi means when you have money and you don't have the qualities

00:33:45.873 --> 00:33:49.006
of a person who should have money.

00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:55.157
In that quality of A-Lakshmi you become very miserly,

00:33:55.392 --> 00:33:58.931
you don't even want to help your brothers and sisters,

00:33:59.189 --> 00:34:03.751
you don't want to give any money to anyone. And even if you give it,

00:34:04.017 --> 00:34:08.501
you give it to false gurus and wrong things.

00:34:09.008 --> 00:34:12.868
This is up to, we can say, is A-Lakshmi,

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.988
the behaviour becomes very arrogant.

00:34:17.487 --> 00:34:21.940
So arrogant that you behave like horses, you know.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:26.566
People look like horses, they walk like horses -

00:34:26.847 --> 00:34:30.067
- but I don't know if the horses have ego.

00:34:30.332 --> 00:34:33.965
If you see these people you just don't understand

00:34:34.215 --> 00:34:37.433
what's gone wrong with them, you see.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:42.925
There was one gentleman who started an aeroplane business,

00:34:43.144 --> 00:34:47.730
aeroplane business in India. I won't take his name,

00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:54.613
but say some Majidhia or someone. And My granddaughter met him

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.519
with My grandson-in-law,

00:34:58.917 --> 00:35:02.571
and they were walking like this, talking like this,

00:35:02.805 --> 00:35:05.909
you see, they can't understand these two persons.

00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:11.440
So, they came and talked to them, who you are and all.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:16.697
And then they said, "We are this Majidhia."

00:35:18.447 --> 00:35:23.822
So My granddaughter said, "Who is Majidhia?"

00:35:24.049 --> 00:35:27.791
My goodness, they fell from heavens,

00:35:28.057 --> 00:35:32.862
"You don't know who are Majidhias! Do you read newspapers or not?"

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:40.369
Then her husband came in. He said, "I do. Now what do you want to say?"

00:35:40.807 --> 00:35:45.049
"We are Majidiyas!" He said, "Who are Majidhias?" "You don't know?

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:51.346
What sort of business you do, what is this?"

00:35:51.885 --> 00:35:57.721
Such stupid things they did that these children felt that there's no use

00:35:57.971 --> 00:36:02.468
having any business, if business means this kind of behaviour.

00:36:02.697 --> 00:36:10.671
Very indecent, very arrogant, they don't know how to relate to people,

00:36:10.898 --> 00:36:16.405
they don't know. And after some time I heard that their business

00:36:16.632 --> 00:36:21.483
was completely finished - it was a flop they call it, flop.

00:36:23.022 --> 00:36:27.593
So now, we have to realise that this Lakshmi,

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:32.218
how it takes us to wrong things.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:42.116
Firstly, She makes you very egoistical.

00:36:43.312 --> 00:36:49.194
Somehow. When a man who has money starts behaving like that

00:36:53.538 --> 00:36:59.772
We cannot understand how a person who was normal,

00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:03.871
suddenly becomes like this, starts talking like this.

00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:08.848
He might earn money even in the horse races.

00:37:12.098 --> 00:37:17.637
Around the Lakshmi is the valency of Dharma.

00:37:19.941 --> 00:37:24.621
There is - around the Lakshmi - is the Dharma.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:30.601
And this Dharma if you cross

00:37:30.835 --> 00:37:35.757
that's the best place where they can cross, the Dharma.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:42.304
Then you can do whatever you like which is Adharmic,

00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:46.992
which is irreligious, which is hideous.

00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:53.531
You have to just cross that limit of Dharma,

00:37:54.007 --> 00:37:59.757
you have to just deviate from Dharma.

00:38:01.117 --> 00:38:07.015
Now as I have said on many a times that there are
ten valencies human beings have got.

00:38:07.554 --> 00:38:12.007
But apart from that, there are many Dharmas

00:38:12.265 --> 00:38:16.273
which are surrounding us - like angels.

00:38:17.484 --> 00:38:22.148
Like first Dharma is

00:38:23.054 --> 00:38:27.648
your Love for humanity, is the first Dharma.

00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:33.138
But if you say from that end when you start,

00:38:33.412 --> 00:38:38.747
it starts with Sree Dharma, is the Dharma

00:38:40.709 --> 00:38:44.653
Is the Dharma of the woman,

00:38:45.278 --> 00:38:49.122
how she should live, how she should get married,

00:38:49.396 --> 00:38:54.496
how she should look after her children, what should be her behaviour,

00:38:54.724 --> 00:39:00.887
all is Sree Dharma. And then is Patni Dharma,

00:39:01.246 --> 00:39:05.582
is the wife, wife's Dharma, what should be her Dharma?

00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:09.989
In her Dharma she looks nice, if she gives up her Dharma

00:39:10.176 --> 00:39:13.316
then she is a prostitute.

00:39:14.691 --> 00:39:20.902
So then is Pathi Dharma, how should be a husband.

00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:26.191
How should he behave towards his family, how should he pay attention

00:39:26.394 --> 00:39:31.708
towards his wife, about the whole, entire family, the whole,

00:39:31.958 --> 00:39:33.364
- you can say -

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:37.841
Parivara they call it the whole, all the relations and everyone.

00:39:38.192 --> 00:39:43.262
That is the wisdom But beyond that is

00:39:43.645 --> 00:39:51.645
the Dharma of Satya Dharma, how much he sticks to truth.

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:58.287
Then the Dharma for Creativity.

00:39:58.545 --> 00:40:02.038
In creativity as you know very well these days,  with money

00:40:02.183 --> 00:40:04.699
people are standing on their heads or I don't know how,

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.944
what they are doing, because the amount of nonsense they are producing

00:40:09.194 --> 00:40:11.983
all over the world in the name of modernism,

00:40:12.194 --> 00:40:16.225
is no way is Khala Dharma, no way.

00:40:17.686 --> 00:40:25.167
Then we have also what you call politics, Rajkaran Dharma.

00:40:25.702 --> 00:40:31.046
This [also] Dharma is there. Now, taking bribes,

00:40:31.249 --> 00:40:35.811
I mean, the kind of things that are going on, corruption,

00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:40.459
all kinds of things that are going on, competition and fighting

00:40:40.724 --> 00:40:47.975
and all that. They are falling from their Dharma of Rajkaran.

00:40:48.764 --> 00:40:54.225
Education same thing, we call it as Shikhshada - Shikhshada.

00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:58.983
All such things are dharmas,

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:05.388
there's a kind of a principle which we have to keep,

00:41:05.998 --> 00:41:11.186
otherwise you can topple down from the Lotus

00:41:12.451 --> 00:41:17.662
and that's what happens. Now we have also Rashtra Dharma.

00:41:19.076 --> 00:41:23.514
The Rashtra Dharma is that your country, you must,

00:41:23.717 --> 00:41:26.061
their's a Dharma of your Rashtra.

00:41:26.342 --> 00:41:30.256
When you have to fight for your country you should,

00:41:30.475 --> 00:41:33.412
but you should not be aggressive on other countries,

00:41:33.638 --> 00:41:36.185
not try to dominate other countries,

00:41:36.404 --> 00:41:40.834
nor you should bring bad name to your country.

00:41:41.989 --> 00:41:44.034
It's very important.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:50.151
Sahaja Yogis have all these intact, absolutely,

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:55.074
because you arestanding on the lotuses already.

00:41:55.416 --> 00:41:58.847
You don't have this problem, normally not.

00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:05.069
Once in a while there are people who behave like that, but mostly

00:42:05.283 --> 00:42:08.791
Sahaja Yogis don't fall into these traps.

00:42:09.179 --> 00:42:12.632
That's why their Lakshmi tattwa will definitely improve.

00:42:12.921 --> 00:42:16.022
They'll have little problems here and there,

00:42:16.741 --> 00:42:21.983
but without problems if you get Lakshmi you'll not have value for Her.

00:42:22.772 --> 00:42:26.257
So with little problems you get the Lakshmi.

00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:33.358
But Lakshmi it doesn't give you all this imbalance.

00:42:33.653 --> 00:42:38.091
Such a man has to be extremely balanced

00:42:38.318 --> 00:42:43.591
because beyond that is the step of Mahalakshmi,

00:42:44.426 --> 00:42:52.191
where your seeking starts, where you become a seeker. You go beyond

00:42:53.300 --> 00:43:01.261
Lakshmi principle and this Mahalakshmi principle starts coming into you.

00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:06.770
I would say in the western countries this consumerism has started

00:43:07.293 --> 00:43:13.113
and it's such a funny one. In America one lady was married to an Indian

00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:18.496
and he used to tell Me how this consumerism works.

00:43:19.043 --> 00:43:23.238
I said, "How?" He said, "I gave my wife money to buy

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:25.974
two shirts for me becauseI had no shirts.

00:43:26.207 --> 00:43:30.113
So she went and bought five skirts.

00:43:30.786 --> 00:43:33.848
So I said, "You have so many skirts, why did you buy the skirts?"

00:43:34.074 --> 00:43:39.497
"Because with this money I could buy five skirts instead of two shirts,

00:43:39.843 --> 00:43:45.867
so I bought five skirts". So he said "I can't wear skirts.

00:43:47.561 --> 00:43:50.609
So how should I correct her?", he said.

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:54.124
I said, "You do one thing: tell her I want to buy some skirts for you,

00:43:54.382 --> 00:43:57.679
and go and buy five shirts".

00:43:58.623 --> 00:44:01.358
Then she will realise that

00:44:01.624 --> 00:44:04.803
if the money was given to her for one purpose,

00:44:05.006 --> 00:44:06.671
it should be used for that.

00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:11.180
This is a very subtle principle which I follow because

00:44:11.375 --> 00:44:13.703
I don't understand money.

00:44:13.913 --> 00:44:17.289
So what I do - whatever money I get I put packets.

00:44:17.547 --> 00:44:21.633
This is for this, this is for this, this is for this - into packets.

00:44:21.977 --> 00:44:25.469
But I don't understand you know and I don't write accounts, you know.

00:44:25.688 --> 00:44:28.944
I'm very bad at all that, somebody else does that.

00:44:29.194 --> 00:44:34.561
Now, if I spend some money from one pocket for some emergency,

00:44:35.053 --> 00:44:39.789
then I again fill it back, it's written there,
so much is there, so much is there.

00:44:40.553 --> 00:44:44.951
So the money is available at the right time for whatever I want to do,

00:44:45.223 --> 00:44:48.779
and the money is in the packet. It is,

00:44:49.042 --> 00:44:56.199
not in the, sort of a open thing, that I can just want to buy

00:44:56.402 --> 00:44:59.652
a Mercedes, I want to buy a Rolls Royce, no, nothing doing,

00:44:59.862 --> 00:45:02.894
it is for something, some purpose,

00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:09.878
and there is no need. So when you go to the shop

00:45:10.487 --> 00:45:14.730
and you see something you won't buy it because that money

00:45:14.963 --> 00:45:18.073
is not kept for that particular thing.

00:45:18.542 --> 00:45:23.870
For Sahaja Yogis it's very easy to handle their money with respect.

00:45:24.659 --> 00:45:27.198
So you go to any shop,

00:45:29.618 --> 00:45:34.688
you won't buy anything. But My nature also is spontaneous.

00:45:35.398 --> 00:45:38.461
So I went to Frankfurt changing,

00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:41.344
they said, "Mother, there's a very nice watch shop".

00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:44.797
I just thought I'm going to get three son-in-laws,

00:45:44.992 --> 00:45:49.101
and what will I give them. So I went to that shop

00:45:49.344 --> 00:45:54.187
and I found such beautiful, beautiful things,

00:45:54.212 --> 00:46:00.087
but I had not kept any money for the watch. But I said, "I must buy."

00:46:00.562 --> 00:46:04.529
One of the watches turned out to be a very unique one,

00:46:04.747 --> 00:46:10.763
and I must tell you, which is no more available. Because of My eyes,

00:46:11.482 --> 00:46:17.693
I saw this is thamting unic and My son-in-law
is so, I mean, overwhelmed,

00:46:18.544 --> 00:46:21.513
so overwhelmed, he's quite rich, he has no problems,

00:46:21.732 --> 00:46:25.763
but he said, "This watch you cannot get."

00:46:25.982 --> 00:46:29.349
Then an article came about that particular watch,

00:46:29.576 --> 00:46:36.480
so he's kept it with him. You see, so to have something - it should

00:46:36.674 --> 00:46:41.658
have a value behind it, that is the Dharma part,

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.726
value behind it. What is the value?

00:46:47.312 --> 00:46:50.656
When you want to buy something just don't buy because

00:46:50.882 --> 00:46:56.242
you are mad, I mean instead of shirts you buy skirts, not that way.

00:46:56.531 --> 00:47:00.796
But anything that has an artistic value

00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:06.562
or some special value - then you should buy that.

00:47:07.241 --> 00:47:10.132
Now this Sari I'm wearing

00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:18.726
- it has a special value, why? Not that it is made with hands,

00:47:19.507 --> 00:47:27.507
is a very beautiful design it has, no. This was made

00:47:27.715 --> 00:47:31.113
in a place called Paithan,

00:47:32.395 --> 00:47:40.238
which was the capital

00:47:41.277 --> 00:47:50.355
of a kingdom, which belonged to My forefathers Shalivahanas.

00:47:50.957 --> 00:47:54.746
And these Saris were made there, Paithan

00:47:55.684 --> 00:47:59.043
and they used to sell it to people. Now they have become expensive,

00:47:59.269 --> 00:48:05.314
in those days they were cheap. Now it has that value.

00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:10.383
They're very honest, very religious, they were called Shalivahanas,

00:48:10.611 --> 00:48:13.884
because they used to give shawl to the Goddess.

00:48:15.743 --> 00:48:18.688
They spread their kingdom very much and also

00:48:18.915 --> 00:48:21.533
there is a calendar in their name.

00:48:21.883 --> 00:48:25.141
But the kind of life they led.

00:48:25.561 --> 00:48:28.298
They were just very generous people

00:48:28.469 --> 00:48:32.173
and they have made beautiful temples,

00:48:32.813 --> 00:48:38.383
beautiful places for people to rest near the river,

00:48:39.207 --> 00:48:42.290
I mean so many beautiful things they have done.

00:48:42.636 --> 00:48:48.235
Apart from that, Rama and Sita when they went to Dhandakharana

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:52.060
they went to this place and you have the place

00:48:52.615 --> 00:48:57.341
and you have the place where Sita took Her bath

00:48:57.849 --> 00:49:03.154
- Her bathing place, there's a little river flowing there.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:08.654
And how it was covered from all the sides and how the light was coming,

00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:12.629
so beautiful. But whatever Rama had done

00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:17.645
they redecorated it with the Rajput style art.

00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:26.083
Then also there was a very beautiful temple I saw that they had made.

00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:29.379
Also I don't know how there was some water flowing.

00:49:30.144 --> 00:49:37.972
And there was Shri Mahadeva's, a big thing, Pindha - very big.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:46.120
And also there was a Parvati's statue,

00:49:46.362 --> 00:49:54.136
so old as that. I don't know if it was put by Rama or by these days,

00:49:54.320 --> 00:50:01.422
My own - you can call them, the grand, great, great grandparents.

00:50:01.796 --> 00:50:05.987
But the beauty about that place that it shows

00:50:06.198 --> 00:50:11.547
that Sita used to worship Mahadeva.

00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:18.588
The water was flowing somehow by nature, inside up there

00:50:18.956 --> 00:50:25.713
in a stream, and She used to take the water and put it on that Pindha.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:32.940
How deep these people were, those who built that temple.

00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:37.291
Such a beautiful temple they have built.

00:50:37.915 --> 00:50:41.157
See so many temples are built like this in India,

00:50:41.376 --> 00:50:47.665
by people who had money, and they believed that if you

00:50:48.016 --> 00:50:54.049
spend your money in this kind of work you are blessed.

00:50:55.063 --> 00:51:02.814
I bought a land near the River Neera, that's My home name, Neera.

00:51:03.185 --> 00:51:07.834
And this land, I just bought it just like that without thinking.

00:51:08.489 --> 00:51:15.013
And what they told that their Guru - Shalivahanas - Guru was Shandilya

00:51:15.404 --> 00:51:20.404
and this place belonged to him long

00:51:20.623 --> 00:51:26.201
time back, which was an ashram of Shandilya - exactly the same.

00:51:28.412 --> 00:51:33.169
And that land I bought very surprisingly,

00:51:33.419 --> 00:51:37.236
then in the newspaper it came out everything about that land,

00:51:37.502 --> 00:51:43.922
and this land was the place where

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:50.038
a great devotee of Shri Vishnu, Pralahda, was praying.

00:51:50.757 --> 00:51:57.242
So you must have heard about Pralahda. His mother

00:51:58.851 --> 00:52:01.796
had a husband, in a long time,

00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:05.023
Hiranyakashapu was her husband, a horrible rakshasa.

00:52:05.562 --> 00:52:09.852
So she ran away from there and who helped was Indra.

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:18.223
He brought this lady to the place of Guru Shandilya

00:52:20.527 --> 00:52:24.004
and Shandilya told Him,

00:52:24.371 --> 00:52:28.559
Indra that, "You don't put any effort for her, I'll look after her,

00:52:28.926 --> 00:52:32.309
and the child that is going to be born to this lady

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:37.293
is going to get the Avatara of Narasimha"

00:52:38.067 --> 00:52:43.934
- you know Narasimha is the man and the lion.

00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:48.686
He said, "How can that be?" He said, "It is so."

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:53.857
So Indra left her there, the child was born, till 5 years that child

00:52:54.068 --> 00:52:57.107
used to play in that land which I have bought.

00:52:57.331 --> 00:53:00.685
But I didn't know about it, but I just saw it,

00:53:00.919 --> 00:53:04.387
I was surprised. But when the child grew up

00:53:04.573 --> 00:53:08.052
after 5 years he had to go back to his father.

00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:11.348
I don't know how many of you read about Pralahda,

00:53:11.574 --> 00:53:14.223
raise your hands, I would like to know.

00:53:16.397 --> 00:53:23.585
The little boy Pralahd, let me see, who was killed and,

00:53:23.811 --> 00:53:29.163
I mean, his father tried to kill him and torture him,

00:53:29.444 --> 00:53:36.475
but he had certain boons so Shri Vishnu appeared as

00:53:38.772 --> 00:53:44.412
Narasimha, means the lion and the human form.

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.835
And then he killed this Hiranyakashapu, the father.

00:53:50.819 --> 00:53:58.396
Now imagine, how much - big it was, that thousands of years back

00:53:59.265 --> 00:54:05.500
this must have happened, and that I should purchase that land only.

00:54:06.092 --> 00:54:10.606
And there is a very beautiful temple built about 300 years back

00:54:10.864 --> 00:54:16.099
by Maharashtrians. So the story is

00:54:16.474 --> 00:54:20.315
that Pralahda came into the dream of the people who wanted to build

00:54:20.518 --> 00:54:26.284
the temple and told them that, "I have already made the statue

00:54:26.511 --> 00:54:29.643
of Narasimha along the river Neera",

00:54:29.862 --> 00:54:32.708
- imagine the name of the river is also Mine -

00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:40.004
"and if you can walk along the banks of Neera river very close

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.403
to the temple, I have made the statue in sand."

00:54:47.887 --> 00:54:54.496
It's a miracle, so when there they went there  and they saw that statue,

00:54:55.129 --> 00:55:00.145
they brought it back and installed it in that temple,

00:55:01.496 --> 00:55:06.309
and it's still there, made of sand.

00:55:06.801 --> 00:55:13.374
Also they say there's a kind of a river or a water flow up to,

00:55:13.637 --> 00:55:16.293
very small one just like the finger,

00:55:16.543 --> 00:55:19.832
flows down from the top, God knows how.

00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:25.566
So, now see the value,

00:55:27.238 --> 00:55:33.137
the value of money which was collected to build this temple

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:38.246
had such an old value.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:47.293
So the value is not money - this one should understand.

00:55:49.254 --> 00:55:52.895
What is the value of the thing?

00:55:54.379 --> 00:55:59.496
You want to give to something to others, then

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:04.855
the feelings you have in your heart is the value,

00:56:05.035 --> 00:56:08.762
and that value is the real Lakshmi.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.539
When you are, say, building a house,

00:56:19.734 --> 00:56:23.367
the plans you make and things you do,

00:56:24.406 --> 00:56:31.911
what is the idea behind and what you are trying to express

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:36.458
through that house is the value of that house.

00:56:39.582 --> 00:56:47.173
Once you understand that you have to buy, with this Lakshmi,

00:56:47.673 --> 00:56:52.462
or you have to use this Lakshmi for certain value,

00:56:52.673 --> 00:56:57.359
and not for showing off or for money.

00:57:01.211 --> 00:57:07.445
This superficialness that we have about money itself

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:14.140
is like an ordinary glass, but if you put behind the glass

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:20.047
the mercury, you can see the value.

00:57:21.218 --> 00:57:28.203
So when you start buying something, what is the purpose,

00:57:28.702 --> 00:57:33.625
why are you buying it - this will determine the value.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.833
Like, last time I came to Portugal

00:57:38.523 --> 00:57:43.500
and I said: "This year we'll go and buy some Terracotta",

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:49.428
but they are very expensive. I said, "This is the price",

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.952
but I wanted to buy Terracotta from Portugal, because

00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:57.530
it's very rich in that. So we went to one factory,

00:57:58.521 --> 00:58:02.538
and the factory was quite far out, none of them could find out,

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:06.069
but I told them, "It's here only just go and see."

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:13.444
And then we bought the Terracotta. But on our way I told,

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:20.975
"Stop, stop here, stop." So they stopped, there was a shop.

00:58:21.389 --> 00:58:25.913
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis in India,

00:58:27.225 --> 00:58:30.273
and also for some people in Cabella.

00:58:30.655 --> 00:58:34.070
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:40.749
They were Sahaja Yogis from here who saw it, such beautiful clothes

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:45.755
and I bought lot of it. I said, "Thank God the problem

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:51.780
presents are finished now for India." So joy-giving it was,

00:58:51.983 --> 00:58:55.093
everybody was surprised - why, suddenly in a

00:58:55.327 --> 00:58:59.796
place where never had been Mother there, suddenly She finds them.

00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:06.304
It has a value, because I wanted to buy something

00:59:06.562 --> 00:59:09.601
for Indians to be given as present.

00:59:10.725 --> 00:59:15.820
So if your Lakshmi is, say, this much,

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.421
once you add to it value it becomes so big.

00:59:23.115 --> 00:59:28.616
The sign of a person who is Lakshmipathi is this -

00:59:29.014 --> 00:59:34.327
he should have a house like the lotus in the hands

00:59:34.577 --> 00:59:42.077
of the Goddess, he should protect people who are depending on him,

00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:47.374
and from the left hand he should give.

00:59:48.974 --> 00:59:52.100
This is the image of the Lakshmi.

00:59:53.085 --> 00:59:56.413
This is what the Lakshmi is within you,

00:59:56.639 --> 01:00:00.608
if you have these four things in balance,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.468
without conditioning, without ego,

01:00:04.694 --> 01:00:09.913
then you are a Sahaja Yogi - otherwise you are not.

01:00:12.304 --> 01:00:19.015
On a Diwali day we have to promise ourselves that whatever

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:22.866
we are going to get now as Lakshmi principle

01:00:23.062 --> 01:00:28.584
or as a Lakshmi's prasad should be used

01:00:30.022 --> 01:00:34.374
in getting things which has value.

01:00:39.061 --> 01:00:44.233
And thus you will learn that you have used your Lakshmi very well,

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:49.319
and with that your and with that your Mahalakshmi
principle become very strong.

01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:55.029
Will become very strong by which you'll ascend very fast.

01:00:57.019 --> 01:01:02.683
Today is the day for us to celebrate the Lakshmi Puja,

01:01:03.454 --> 01:01:08.001
but Lakshmi Puja doesn't mean that

01:01:09.079 --> 01:01:15.813
you worship money. Money as it is, is the most dangerous thing,

01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:23.219
and I think it is the hidden weapon of Lakshmi Devi.

01:01:24.204 --> 01:01:30.204
See, if you try to misuse Her, She goes on punching with it.

01:01:31.022 --> 01:01:36.624
With when one punch if you don't realise
then She gives you another punch, like that.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:44.060
Then She might little bit twist you, to suggest. She'll try everything,

01:01:44.246 --> 01:01:47.630
to convince you that what you are doing is nonsense -

01:01:47.872 --> 01:01:53.278
ultimately She sees your destruction completely.

01:01:54.513 --> 01:01:59.763
So, Lakshmi, though She is the one who is a giver of boons,

01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:02.682
giver of everything,

01:02:03.283 --> 01:02:08.619
you should not be mislead by her Mahamaya character.

01:02:08.893 --> 01:02:14.406
I'm your Mother so I better tell you to be very careful.

01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:16.173
Thank you very much!
