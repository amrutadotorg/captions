WEBVTT

05:50.000 --> 06:05.159
Today, we have gathered here to worship Shri
Lakshmi.

06:05.159 --> 06:25.710
In Diwali, in India, they worship Lakshmi
because a great rakshasa called Narakasura

06:25.710 --> 06:42.139
was killed. Also that Lakshmi came out of
the sea, at the same time, long time back.

06:42.139 --> 07:00.520
I mean, I should say, this is like Her different
appearances on the same XXX. Lakshmi is the

07:00.520 --> 07:16.430
Goddess which gives us wealth, gives us prosperity.
She is very blissful, no doubt. She gives

07:16.430 --> 07:30.930
you protection and also She is very humble
because She stands on the lotus. She is very

07:30.930 --> 07:43.789
light, means doesn’t put Her pressure on
anyone. These are symbols of Shri Lakshmi,

07:43.789 --> 07:52.750
but also She is a part of Mahamaya in the
modern times. When people get Lakshmi, the

07:52.750 --> 08:09.969
money, they don’t understand that She is
their Mother and She is to be respected. When

08:09.969 --> 08:21.719
this kind of perverse idea of Shri Lakshmi
comes in such countries, such people meet

08:21.719 --> 08:38.880
their last end and destruction of the worst
type. So this Lakshmi has to be used with

08:38.880 --> 08:49.870
a big balance, like standing on a lotus and
not get into the pond, where there are all

08:49.870 --> 08:59.840
kinds of creatures to eat you all. You have
to stand on the lotus, that means that you

08:59.840 --> 09:17.510
are above all the lures of this Maya. Also
in Sanskrit languages, we call Lakshmi as

09:17.510 --> 09:24.600
the Maya. If somebody gets lot of money, they
will say: "You got lot of Maya."

09:24.600 --> 09:39.100
Now, this Maya plays the tricks. If money,
prosperity was the salvation, then, there

09:39.100 --> 09:50.190
would have been no problem in this world because
those people who have money always get ruined.

09:50.190 --> 10:00.320
If they are not ruined, their children, their
grandchildren get ruined. This principle of

10:00.320 --> 10:14.029
Lakshmi within us is very dubious and the
allurement is so much that people see somebody

10:14.029 --> 10:21.680
having a good car these days, they say: "Oh,
what a man he is..." In any case, he’s not

10:21.680 --> 10:32.970
going to give you the car. If somebody is
having lots of, what you can call, palaces

10:32.970 --> 10:46.630
or buildings, people start admiring! This
is Kali Yuga. They start admiring: "See this

10:46.630 --> 11:00.339
man, he is so rich!" Even clothes: people
see you wearing clothes which are very good

11:00.339 --> 11:16.170
tailored, might be from some designers, say.
They think knowing of that man. For example

11:16.170 --> 11:21.910
in England, there is another befouling place
called "Saville Row." So if you want to buy

11:21.910 --> 11:32.639
one suit, you have to pay sometimes 3000 pounds.
Now, people are so stupid that now if they

11:32.639 --> 11:39.050
wear a suit from "Saville Row", they put the
brand outside, "Saville Row." All such thorough

11:39.050 --> 11:50.430
foolery is going on all over the world. The
clothes have no meaning, their life style

11:50.430 --> 11:58.440
has no meaning. Ultimately they end up in
Swiss bank.

11:58.440 --> 12:08.769
The Lakshmi Tattwa of Swiss bank is also now
showing its teeth, and if you read what’s

12:08.769 --> 12:18.360
happening to them, I mean, they are shaking,
they don’t know. They went to this limit

12:18.360 --> 12:32.009
that they took the teeth, golden teeth of
the Jews! I mean, it’s going to far! All

12:32.009 --> 12:39.110
this thorough foolery has been going on. They
have military services. Why? Who’s going

12:39.110 --> 12:48.259
to conquer that country? Even Napoleon didn’t
do that. And they have made big caves to keep

12:48.259 --> 12:55.529
their weapons there. Who’s going to attack
them? Stupid people... Suffering from ego.

12:55.529 --> 13:12.070
But the attack has come and this attack is
so serious that they might be completely shattered

13:12.070 --> 13:21.829
and destroyed. Now, who falls for this kind
of thing, you should see, are the people who

13:21.829 --> 13:38.829
are crooks, who are dishonest, who are absolutely
adharmic. They can be Mafia, XXX or they can

13:38.829 --> 13:49.589
be some thugs, some black marketers, some
smugglers. So, going against the Lakshmi principle,

13:49.589 --> 13:58.500
are so many done these days. One fellow who
was thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, because he

13:58.500 --> 14:04.519
was trying to be very dominating and all that,
he said: "That’s better." I said: "Why?"

14:04.519 --> 14:11.449
He’s doing now smuggling, making money out
of smuggling and he has become very rich,

14:11.449 --> 14:23.670
according to him; but it comes to an end and
a very tragic, bad end. Money is such a lure

14:23.670 --> 14:41.389
for human beings that it kills all sense of
decency of higher values, everything. A brother,

14:41.389 --> 14:49.620
say, who is very nice and good fellow, if
he gets money out of proportion by doing hanky-panky,

14:49.620 --> 14:57.089
he neglects his mother, father, brothers,
sisters, everything. So I would say, then

14:57.089 --> 15:09.769
it comes to that point that Lakshmiji becomes
a bhoot then and all Her blessings becomes

15:09.769 --> 15:23.940
a sort of a challenge to your dignity.
Now, certain countries, like America which

15:23.940 --> 15:34.940
is the area for Shri Krishna, because He is
Kubera, they have no money as such. I’ve

15:34.940 --> 15:44.509
seen they are all poor, they are all indebted.
So many Indians went to America and they can’t

15:44.509 --> 15:51.209
come to India now. "Why?" "We are indebted."
"Why are you indebted?" "Oh, we get everything

15:51.209 --> 15:59.540
free, now, you see, the bank gives us loan,
we can have the best life style." So they

15:59.540 --> 16:06.569
will have three Mercedes. Is nothing! "Three
Mercedes is nothing. You should have Rolls

16:06.569 --> 16:23.500
Royce’s, we should have this." "For what?
What do you get out of it?" Now of course,

16:23.500 --> 16:30.519
little bit they are shaken out with the stock
exchange and all that nonsense they have started,

16:30.519 --> 16:48.759
all these jokes and all these very big kind
of loggerheads. All now are coming out. So,

16:48.759 --> 16:58.120
this is no Lakshmi, because Lakshmi must give
you dignity, prosperity and respect. I think

16:58.120 --> 17:03.860
Americans understood about it, so they become
philanthropist, means they are giving money

17:03.860 --> 17:12.440
to people. To whom did they give money? All
the names these people took from South Africa

17:12.440 --> 17:24.490
were all the money given by the philanthropist
of America. What has happened to their wisdom?

17:24.490 --> 17:36.270
That 16-year old boy, he went there and then
all ages went there and made a very big money.

17:36.270 --> 18:51.179
All this money making proposition...

18:51.179 --> 18:58.590
So what is the matter if there is a blessing
of Lakshmi? Why a man who gets the blessing

18:58.590 --> 19:10.020
of Lakshmi becomes so funny, so stupid and
ultimately ends up his life that people are

19:10.020 --> 19:33.530
not there even to pick up his dead body?
What is the difference between money and Lakshmi?

19:33.530 --> 19:39.870
She gives you money, alright, agreed, but
when She is giving the money, what happens

19:39.870 --> 19:49.309
to that money which comes to you? It’s a
very subtle thing one should understand. In

19:49.309 --> 19:57.809
India if you give 100 rupees to a servant,
immediately he’ll go to drink somewhere.

19:57.809 --> 20:07.179
First, idea will come, what he should do,
he’ll go for a drink. Of the hard one, I

20:07.179 --> 20:14.740
mean; your moorka is nowhere near that, such
hard one they make in India, you know. It

20:14.740 --> 20:25.830
is called as Hatbhatti, made with hands. So
in 100 rupees, they are willing to go. I mean,

20:25.830 --> 20:38.529
that means any money you give to them, it
spoils their life completely. Lakshmi has

20:38.529 --> 20:48.870
been given, alright, so what happen to this
Lakshmi? She changes Her form and Her form

20:48.870 --> 21:00.230
is so bad that you are completely ruined with
that.

21:00.230 --> 21:17.770
So, now we have to understand what is the
way we can use the Lakshmi. Supposing I get

21:17.770 --> 21:32.400
money, supposing. Then I will go to the market,
say, and I’ll see something nice: "Ahh!

21:32.400 --> 21:44.210
This is very good for this Sahaja Yogi." Or
I will say: "This will be very handy for our

21:44.210 --> 21:57.929
ashram." Immediately the mind starts working
in a very socialistic way, I should say. Not

21:57.929 --> 22:08.400
individualistic. For example, I went to Rajasthan
and I saw such a lot of sand, just like a

22:08.400 --> 22:19.510
big desert, big dunes, everything. And people
starving. So I said: "How to get money to

22:19.510 --> 22:32.179
these people?" So, I said: "Let Me start a
factory, factory with the unbreakable glass,

22:32.179 --> 22:42.700
which they make only in France." They make
it very cheap and regarded as a very cheap

22:42.700 --> 22:51.850
thing, not in India. In India, if you go to
some elite’s house, they’ll offer you

22:51.850 --> 23:00.740
tea in these unbreakable things, they think
it’s very elite, you know, it depends on

23:00.740 --> 23:12.320
what you think about. And very proud of it.
So, I said, if you make these things in India,

23:12.320 --> 23:18.230
these poor people, you know, because there
is so much sand and sand is needed by trucks,

23:18.230 --> 23:31.840
so I will utilise this to make this beautiful
factory here and then give them some support

23:31.840 --> 23:43.190
to live well.
Now, when I went to one place called Warana.

23:43.190 --> 23:50.400
You all had come also once. There’s a gentleman
who was a disciple of Gandhiji and he has

23:50.400 --> 24:01.260
organised this Warana company for distributing
milk. It became so very rich, so very rich,

24:01.260 --> 24:07.059
it’s a co-operative, so he started giving
money to all the co-operative people, those

24:07.059 --> 24:12.779
who were labour there. Now, this labour had
never seen that money, so he came to Me, touched

24:12.779 --> 24:19.720
My feet and said: "Mother, You tell me now,
what should I do: I’m so unhappy with the

24:19.720 --> 24:28.529
development of this Warana, because there
are prostitutes who arrived from Bombay, there

24:28.529 --> 24:37.570
are all kinds of hard deals which have come
from Bombay and these people are smoking like

24:37.570 --> 24:50.770
hell, they are taking drugs..." "Hey?" "Yes!
Wherever there is money, the drug goes there

24:50.770 --> 24:57.350
and the children are becoming absolutely useless,
they don’t want to study, they even slap

24:57.350 --> 25:08.480
their parents." So he said: "This was not
Gandhiji’s ideal, now what has happened?"

25:08.480 --> 25:14.950
He says: "This is a curse of money." And he
was crying.

25:14.950 --> 25:32.080
Now, how can Lakshmi become a curse? It does!
It is in the Nabhi. What a central position

25:32.080 --> 25:54.929
it has and when this Nabhi starts working,
it is a very remarkable thing that you feel

25:54.929 --> 26:10.320
gobbling the food all the time with this Nabhi.
You go on eating, go on eating like mad and

26:10.320 --> 26:19.230
then some bhoot comes in to eat also with
you inside the Nabhi. Then you can eat so

26:19.230 --> 26:32.990
much that no human beings can eat like that,
except for the people who are rich. Then you

26:32.990 --> 26:45.850
start a big science or what you can call etiquette.
I don’t want to hurt anybody, I mean, if

26:45.850 --> 26:56.390
you are eating well I don’t mind, eat well.
But the fuss part is, because today is Diwali,

26:56.390 --> 27:04.210
I’m trying to tell you all these interesting
stories.

27:04.210 --> 27:17.370
I went many times for dinner with French diplomats.
My goodness!! Now, Me and My husband don’t

27:17.370 --> 27:23.600
drink, so forty five minutes they were only
discussing what they will have today. Then

27:23.600 --> 27:30.409
they remember, yesterday they had that, the
day before, they had that, so there should

27:30.409 --> 27:36.830
be variety. So, then they came down to something,
not all of them drinking the same, different,

27:36.830 --> 27:44.690
different. So, they came to some point: "Alright,
we’ll have this." But some people asked

27:44.690 --> 27:53.320
for something which was not available. So
they said: "You have to have it!" And they

27:53.320 --> 28:01.409
shouted at them. My goodness! They took forty
five minutes to decide what they are going

28:01.409 --> 28:10.019
to eat. It’s regarded as French etiquette,
I think, and we took chief guest Myself and

28:10.019 --> 28:17.679
My husband. Looking at this man and looking
at that woman, did not know what to do with

28:17.679 --> 28:22.640
those etiquette. We were thinking, now better
go.

28:22.640 --> 28:31.789
Then came to food. They are so particular:
"I like this and I like that." They are worst

28:31.789 --> 28:45.659
than Indians, I think, and they took at least,
at least eighty minutes to decide what they

28:45.659 --> 28:57.630
will eat. Ultimately, they found something
nice, each different and the restaurant people

28:57.630 --> 29:03.070
were trying to pamper their ego: "Oh, what
a thing you have chosen, this is the....Wah,

29:03.070 --> 29:17.929
wah, wah..." So they started serving. The
cheese was smelling so awful, I tell you.

29:17.929 --> 29:28.010
We couldn’t bare it, you know, both of us,
so My husband told them: "Today is our fasting

29:28.010 --> 29:35.549
day for both of us." He said: "Why is it a
fasting day?" He says: "In India, we have,

29:35.549 --> 29:40.760
you know, fasting like this, sometimes we
have to fast; today is our..." But I told

29:40.760 --> 29:45.019
him: "Here, one day you are saying today is
our fasting, but we have to go to so many

29:45.019 --> 29:52.519
dinners, what will you do?" He says: "Everywhere,
better to say that we are fasting." Such a

29:52.519 --> 30:02.750
horrible cheese they brought and they started
boasting that they have 200 types of cheese,

30:02.750 --> 30:17.610
200 types of the smelly ones. "From where
did you get?" They said: "This is French perfection!"

30:17.610 --> 30:28.510
I said: "What is this French perfection?"
But then, you know, tears came into My eyes.

30:28.510 --> 30:34.649
C.P. said: "Why are you crying?" "Not crying,
but I think what will happen to these people

30:34.649 --> 30:46.730
with their cheese, where will they go? Even
if they go to hell, people will throw them

30:46.730 --> 31:00.320
away with the smell of the cheese."
Then I read how this cheese came in. So they

31:00.320 --> 31:09.529
said that there was a big snow fall and they
had put some big, big containers in a cave

31:09.529 --> 31:16.110
of milk and people forgot about it. Snow fall
was there for 20 days, whatever it was, and

31:16.110 --> 31:21.820
they just forgot about it. So, after one year,
they got the smell, you see, coming out of

31:21.820 --> 31:30.570
it; so they went and saw the cheese being
formed, can you imagine? This is the beginning

31:30.570 --> 31:38.200
of the hell. Actually, one should never eat
anything that is kept overnight, normally.

31:38.200 --> 31:46.950
But now they have got fridge, so you can keep
it for 2 days, 3 days at the most. Like on

31:46.950 --> 31:53.909
the ship they keep it. But this I couldn’t
understand that this cheese which they told

31:53.909 --> 32:02.360
Me is very old. I said: "Really?" And they
sell it by that, what old it is. And their

32:02.360 --> 32:10.990
wines, if they are, say, 200 years old it
is 200 times more expensive. So, it’s such

32:10.990 --> 32:20.519
a bhootish thing to eat all that. So, when
the Lakshmi goes into the hands of bhoots

32:20.519 --> 32:30.360
on a very less level, I should say, these
days, then it goes into the heads of people

32:30.360 --> 32:42.980
who want to exploit money, exploit poor people,
exploit countries which are downtrodden, go

32:42.980 --> 32:48.590
on like this, collecting money, you know,
looting, looting, looting.

32:48.590 --> 32:56.659
When English came to India, we did know, they
used to take brides. On Diwali day if you

32:56.659 --> 33:02.289
went there without any present they say: "Oh,
baksheesh, you must give some presents." And

33:02.289 --> 33:07.960
what they liked was our country liqueur, I
never knew this, but later on I came to know

33:07.960 --> 33:14.500
because My husband became a collector of XXX
and there where bottles of country liqueurs

33:14.500 --> 33:20.769
kept in that house, with that house was itself
more than hundred year old. Long time back

33:20.769 --> 33:27.200
it was kept but still, some of them, you see
and we could have sent them to England to

33:27.200 --> 33:35.799
sell, I mean, it would have been a good idea.
So, the older it is, it’s better. This Lakshmi

33:35.799 --> 33:44.210
I think becomes old and dies and there is
alakshmi. Alakshmi means when you have money

33:44.210 --> 33:51.360
and you don’t have the qualities of a person
who should have money. In that quality of

33:51.360 --> 33:59.019
Alakshmi, you become very miserly, you don’t
want even to help your brothers and sisters,

33:59.019 --> 34:05.080
you don’t want to give any money to anyone
and even if you give it, you give it to false

34:05.080 --> 34:13.510
gurus and wrong things. This is up to, we
can say, is Alakshmi.

34:13.510 --> 34:22.840
The behaviour becomes very arrogant, so arrogant
that you behave like horses you know, people

34:22.840 --> 34:31.560
look like horses: they walk like horses, but
I don’t know if horses have ego. If you

34:31.560 --> 34:39.960
see these people, you just don’t understand
what has gone wrong with them. There is one

34:39.960 --> 34:46.200
gentleman who started an aeroplane business,
aeroplane business in India. I won’t take

34:46.200 --> 34:56.250
his name but say some Majidya or something
like that and my granddaughter met him with

34:56.250 --> 35:05.070
my grandson-in-law and they were walking like
this, talking like this, you see, they can’t

35:05.070 --> 35:13.410
understand these two persons; so, they came
and talk to them who you are and all that

35:13.410 --> 35:23.360
and then they said: "We are this Majidya."
So, my granddaughter said: "Who is Majidya?"

35:23.360 --> 35:30.690
"My goodness!", they fell from heavens, "You
don’t know who are Majidyas, do you read

35:30.690 --> 35:39.910
newspapers or not?" Then her husband came
in, he said: "I do." "Now what do you want

35:39.910 --> 35:48.000
to say? We are Majidyas!" He said: "Who are
Majidyas?" "You don’t know? What sort of

35:48.000 --> 35:56.570
business you do, what is this..." Such stupid
things they did that these children felt that

35:56.570 --> 36:04.150
there is no use having any business; if business
means this kind of behaviour, very indecent,

36:04.150 --> 36:14.640
very arrogant, they don’t know how to relate
to people, they don’t know! And after some

36:14.640 --> 36:23.530
time, I heard that their business was completely
finished, was a flop, they call it a flop.

36:23.530 --> 36:38.800
So now, we have to realise that this Lakshmi,
how it takes us to wrong things. Firstly,

36:38.800 --> 36:54.010
She makes you very egoistical. Somehow, if
a man has money, he starts behaving like that.

36:54.010 --> 37:02.280
One cannot understand how a person who was
normal, suddenly becomes like this, starts

37:02.280 --> 37:09.280
talking like this. He might earn money, even,
in the horse races.

37:09.280 --> 37:26.590
Around the Lakshmi is the valence of Dharma.
There is around the Lakshmi, is the Dharma

37:26.590 --> 37:34.860
and this Dharma if you cross, that’s the
best place where they can cross the Dharma.

37:34.860 --> 37:50.560
Then, you can do whatever you like. This adharmi
which is irreligious, which is hideous, you

37:50.560 --> 37:59.010
have to just cross that limit of that Dharma.
We have to just deviate from Dharma.

37:59.010 --> 38:09.470
Now, as I said many a times that ten valences
human beings have got, but apart from that,

38:09.470 --> 38:20.090
there are many Dharmas which are surrounding
everything, like angels. Like first Dharma

38:20.090 --> 38:33.620
is your love for humanity, is the first Dharma
but if you say from that end when you start,

38:33.620 --> 38:48.860
it starts with 3 Dharmas, is the Dharma of
the woman, how she should live, how she should

38:48.860 --> 38:55.620
get married, how she should look after her
children, what should be her behaviour, all

38:55.620 --> 39:04.700
is three Dharmas. And then is Patni Dharma,
is the wife, wife Dharma, what should be her

39:04.700 --> 39:14.100
Dharma. In her Dharma she looks nice. If she
gives up her Dharma then she is a prostitute.

39:14.100 --> 39:25.270
So, then is Pati Dharma: how should be a husband,
how he should behave towards his family, how

39:25.270 --> 39:34.130
should he pay attention towards his wife,
about the whole entire family, the whole,

39:34.130 --> 39:41.780
you can say parivar, as they call it, all
the relations. That is his Dharma but beyond

39:41.780 --> 39:57.550
that is the Dharma of Satya Dharma: how much
he sticks to truth, then the Dharma for creativity.

39:57.550 --> 40:03.840
In creativity as you know very well these
days, with money people are standing on their

40:03.840 --> 40:09.460
heads or I don’t know what they are doing
because the amount of nonsense they are producing

40:09.460 --> 40:18.300
all over the world in the name of modernism
is no way is Kala Dharma, no way.

40:18.300 --> 40:30.320
Then we have also politics, Rajkaran Dharma.
This also Dharma is there, now taking bribes,

40:30.320 --> 40:38.030
I mean the kind of things that are going on,
corruption, all kinds of things that are going

40:38.030 --> 40:47.130
on, competition, fighting and all that. They
are falling from their Dharma of Rajkaran.

40:47.130 --> 40:56.010
Education, same thing; we call it Shiksha
Dharma.

40:56.010 --> 41:07.730
All such things are Dharmas; there is a kind
of a principle which we have to keep, otherwise

41:07.730 --> 41:20.010
you can topple down from the lotus and that’s
what happens. Now we have also Rashtra Dharma.

41:20.010 --> 41:28.400
The Rashtra Dharma is that your country, there
is a Dharma of your Rashtra. When you have

41:28.400 --> 41:33.290
to fight for your country, you should, but
you should not be aggressive on other countries,

41:33.290 --> 41:41.410
it’s not right to dominate other countries
nor you should bring bad name to your country.

41:41.410 --> 41:53.050
It’s very important! Sahaja Yogis have all
this intact, absolutely, because you are standing

41:53.050 --> 42:00.730
on the lotuses already. You don’t have this
problem, normally no. Once in a while there

42:00.730 --> 42:09.240
are people who behave like that but mostly
Sahaja yogis don’t fall into these traps,

42:09.240 --> 42:14.810
that’s why their Lakshmi Tattwa will definitely
improve. They’ll have little problems here

42:14.810 --> 42:22.530
and there but without problems if you get
Lakshmi, you will not value for it. So, with

42:22.530 --> 42:34.200
little problems, you get the Lakshmi. But
Lakshmi doesn’t give you all this imbalance.

42:34.200 --> 42:45.590
Such a man has to be extremely balanced because
beyond that is the step of Mahalakshmi where

42:45.590 --> 42:57.960
your seeking starts, where you become a seeker.
You go beyond Lakshmi principle and this Mahalakshmi

42:57.960 --> 43:05.420
principle starts coming into it.
I would say the Western countries this consumerism

43:05.420 --> 43:13.530
has started and it’s such a funny one. In
America, one lady was married to an Indian

43:13.530 --> 43:21.530
and he used to tell Me how this consumerism
works. I said: "How?" He said: "I gave my

43:21.530 --> 43:29.050
wife money to buy two shirts for me because
I had no shirts. So, she went and bought five

43:29.050 --> 43:35.950
skirts. So, I said: "You have so many skirts,
why did you buy the skirts?" "Because in this

43:35.950 --> 43:44.900
money I could buy five skirts instead of two
shirts, so I bought five skirts." So he said:

43:44.900 --> 43:51.900
"I can’t wear skirts!" "So, how I should
correct her?" he said. I said: "You do one

43:51.900 --> 43:58.940
thing, tell her you want to buy some skirts
for her and go and buy five shirts, then she

43:58.940 --> 44:07.310
will realise that if the money was given to
her for one purpose should be used for that."

44:07.310 --> 44:14.570
This is a very subtle principle which I follow
because I don’t understand money. So, what

44:14.570 --> 44:20.510
I do, whatever money I get I put packets:
this is for this, this is for this, this is

44:20.510 --> 44:26.150
for this, into packets. But I don’t understand,
you know and I don’t write accounts. I’m

44:26.150 --> 44:32.220
very bad about all that. Somebody else does
that. Now, if I spend some money from one

44:32.220 --> 44:38.170
pocket for some emergency, then I again fill
it back, it’s written there: so much is

44:38.170 --> 44:43.240
there, so much is there. So, the money is
available at the right time for whatever I

44:43.240 --> 44:55.050
want to do and the money is in the packet.
It is not in sort of an open thing that I

44:55.050 --> 45:00.610
can just want to buy a Mercedes, I want to
buy a Rolls Royce, no nothing doing, it is

45:00.610 --> 45:11.200
for something, some purpose and there is no
need. So, when you go to the shop and you

45:11.200 --> 45:17.630
see something, you won’t buy because that
money is not kept for that particular thing.

45:17.630 --> 45:26.220
For Sahaja Yogis it is very easy to handle
their money with respect. So, you go to any

45:26.220 --> 45:32.540
shop, you won’t buy anything.

45:32.540 --> 45:39.170
But My nature also is spontaneous. So, I went
to Frankfurt, changing. They said: "Mother,

45:39.170 --> 45:45.960
there is a very nice watch shop." I just thought
I’m going to get three son-in-laws and what

45:45.960 --> 45:52.870
am I going to give them? So, I went to that
shop and I found such beautiful, beautiful

45:52.870 --> 46:02.080
things but I have not kept any money for the
watch, but I said I must buy. One of the watches

46:02.080 --> 46:09.730
turned out to be a very unique one, I must
tell you, which is no more available. Because

46:09.730 --> 46:18.370
of My eyes, I saw this something unique and
My son-in-law is so... I mean, over wealth,

46:18.370 --> 46:26.540
so... quite rich, he has no problems, but
he said: "This watch you cannot get it." Then

46:26.540 --> 46:36.050
an article came about that particular watch.
So he has kept it with him. You see, have

46:36.050 --> 46:43.690
something that it should have a value behind
it. That is the Dharma part. Value behind

46:43.690 --> 46:51.760
it; what is the value? When you want to buy
something just don’t buy because you are

46:51.760 --> 46:59.790
mad, I mean instead of shirts you buy skirts,
not that way. But anything that has an artistic

46:59.790 --> 47:07.190
value or some special value, then you should
buy that.

47:07.190 --> 47:19.780
Now this sari I’m wearing, it has a special
value. Why? Not that it is made with hands

47:19.780 --> 47:34.820
is a very beautiful design it has, no. This
was made in place called Paithan which was

47:34.820 --> 47:52.260
the capital of a kingdom which belongs to
My forefathers: Shalivanas and these saris

47:52.260 --> 47:59.010
were made there, Paithan and they used to
sell it to people. Now they have becoming

47:59.010 --> 48:07.610
expensive, in those days they were cheaper.
Now, it has that value; they are very honest,

48:07.610 --> 48:13.590
very religious, they are called Shalivanas
because they used to give shawls to the Goddess.

48:13.590 --> 48:22.580
They spread their kingdom very much and also
there is a calendar in their name but the

48:22.580 --> 48:30.460
kind of life they led: they were just very
generous people and they have made beautiful

48:30.460 --> 48:41.010
temples, beautiful places for people to rest
near the river. I mean, so many beautiful

48:41.010 --> 48:48.310
things they have done. Apart from that Rama
and Sita, when they went to Dandakaranya,

48:48.310 --> 48:58.280
they went to this place and you have the place
where Sita took Her bath, Her bathing place.

48:58.280 --> 49:07.780
There is a little river flowing there. How
it was covered from all the side and how the

49:07.780 --> 49:15.120
light was coming, so beautiful. But whatever
Rama had done they redecorated it with the

49:15.120 --> 49:26.730
Rajput style. Then also there was a very beautiful
temple, I saw that they have made. Also, I

49:26.730 --> 49:40.020
don’t know how, there was some water flowing
and there was Shri Mahadeva, a big thing Pinda

49:40.020 --> 49:53.320
and also there was a Parvati statue. So old
as that, I don’t know if it was put by Rama

49:53.320 --> 50:04.360
or by My own, you can call them great, great,
great grandfathers, but the beauty about that

50:04.360 --> 50:15.800
place that it shows that Sita used to worship
Mahadeva. The water was flowing, somehow by

50:15.800 --> 50:24.600
nature inside, up there in a stream and She
used to take the water and put it on that

50:24.600 --> 50:35.500
pond. How deep these people were; those who
built that temple, such a beautiful temple

50:35.500 --> 50:42.810
they have made. You see, so many temples are
built like this in India by people who had

50:42.810 --> 50:56.160
money and they believed that if you spend
your money in this kind of work, you are blessed.

50:56.160 --> 51:05.020
I bought a land, near the river Nira; that’s
My own name: Nira and this land I just bought

51:05.020 --> 51:13.250
it just like that without thinking and what
they told that their guru, Shalivanas guru

51:13.250 --> 51:23.950
was Shandilya and this place belonged to him
long time back which was an ashram of Shandilya,

51:23.950 --> 51:34.740
exactly the same. And that land I bought,
very surprisingly. Then in the newspaper,

51:34.740 --> 51:46.450
it came out everything about that land and
this land was the place where a great devotee

51:46.450 --> 51:59.480
of Shri Vishnu: Pralada was playing. You must
have heard about Pralad. His mother had a

51:59.480 --> 52:06.970
husband, long time, Hiranyakashapur was her
husband, horrible rakshasa, so she ran away

52:06.970 --> 52:21.070
from there and who help her was Indra. He
brought this lady to the place of guru Shandilya

52:21.070 --> 52:27.820
and Shandilya told him, Indra, that: "You
don’t put any effort for her, I’ll look

52:27.820 --> 52:35.490
after her. And the child that is going to
be born to this lady is going to get the avatar

52:35.490 --> 52:46.090
of Narasimha." You know Narasimha is the man
and the lion. He said: "How can that be?"

52:46.090 --> 52:54.430
He said: "It is so." So Indra left her there.
The child was born. Till five years that child

52:54.430 --> 53:00.840
used to play in that land which I bought.
But I didn’t know about it. I just saw it;

53:00.840 --> 53:08.000
I was surprised. But when the child grew up,
up to five years he had to go back to his

53:08.000 --> 53:16.740
father. I don’t know how many of you read
about Pralada? Raise your hand, I would like

53:16.740 --> 53:26.430
to know, let me see...who was killed and I
mean his father was trying to kill him and

53:26.430 --> 53:42.070
torture him but he had certain boons. So Shri
Vishnu appeared as Narasimha, means the lion

53:42.070 --> 53:49.510
and the human form. And then He killed this
Hiranyakashapur, the father.

53:49.510 --> 54:02.250
Now, imagine how much it was that thousands
years back, this must have happened and I

54:02.250 --> 54:11.220
should purchase that land and there is a very
good temple built about 300 years back by

54:11.220 --> 54:20.300
Maharashtrians. So, the story is that Pralada
came into the dream of the people who wanted

54:20.300 --> 54:28.910
to built the temple and told them that: "I
already made a statue of Narasimha along the

54:28.910 --> 54:38.220
river Nira." Imagine the name of the river
is also mine. "And if you can walk along the

54:38.220 --> 54:46.720
banks of Nira river very close to the temple,
I’ve made the statue in sand." "It’s a

54:46.720 --> 54:57.360
miracle!" So, they went there and they saw
that statue. They brought it back and installed

54:57.360 --> 55:08.990
it in that temple. And it is still there,
made of sand. Also they say there’s a kind

55:08.990 --> 55:19.460
of a river or a water flow, very small one,
just like the finger flows down from the top,

55:19.460 --> 55:32.360
God knows how. So, now see the value, the
value of money which was collected to built

55:32.360 --> 55:49.910
this temple had such an old value. So, the
value is not money. This, one should understand

55:49.910 --> 56:01.460
what is the value of the thing you want to
give something to others, then the feelings

56:01.460 --> 56:14.220
you have in your heart is the value and that
value is the real Lakshmi. When you are, say,

56:14.220 --> 56:28.150
building a house, the plans you make, the
things you do, what is the idea behind and

56:28.150 --> 56:38.170
what you are trying to express through that
house is the value of that house.

56:38.170 --> 56:49.710
Once you understand that, you have to buy
with this Lakshmi or you have to use this

56:49.710 --> 57:03.120
Lakshmi for certain value and not for showing
off or for money. This superficialness that

57:03.120 --> 57:14.750
we have about money itself is like an ordinary
glass. But if you put behind the glass the

57:14.750 --> 57:27.920
mercury you can see the value. So, when you
start buying something, what is the purpose?

57:27.920 --> 57:36.760
Why are you buying? This will determine the
value. Like the last time I came to Portugal

57:36.760 --> 57:48.110
and I said we’ll go and buy some terra-cotta.
But they are very expensive. I said this is

57:48.110 --> 57:55.270
the price, but I wanted to buy terra-cotta
from Portugal because it’s very rigid. So,

57:55.270 --> 58:03.210
we went to one factory and the factory was
quite far away. None of them could find out,

58:03.210 --> 58:11.250
but I told them: "It’s here only, just go
and see!" And then we bought the terra-cotta.

58:11.250 --> 58:20.790
But on our way, I told: "Stop, stop here,
stop!" So, they stopped; there was a shop.

58:20.790 --> 58:31.120
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis
in India and also for some people in Cabella.

58:31.120 --> 58:37.770
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.
There were some Sahaja Yogis from here who

58:37.770 --> 58:46.280
saw that. Such beautiful clothes. I bought
a lot of it. I said: "Thank God, the problem

58:46.280 --> 58:54.050
presents are finished now for India." So joy
giving it was. Everybody was surprised: "Why

58:54.050 --> 59:02.590
suddenly in a place where never have been
Mother there, suddenly She finds?" It has

59:02.590 --> 59:11.480
a value because I wanted to buy some things
for Indians to be given as presents. So, if

59:11.480 --> 59:23.470
a Lakshmi is say, this much, once you add
to it a value it becomes so.

59:23.470 --> 59:32.940
The sign of a person who is Lakshmi Pati is
this: he should have a house like a lotus

59:32.940 --> 59:44.150
in the hands of the Goddess, he should protect
people who are depending on him and from the

59:44.150 --> 59:55.540
left hand, he should give. This is the image
of the Lakshmi. This is what the Lakshmi is

59:55.540 --> 01:00:05.140
within you. If you have this four things in
balance without conditioning, without ego,

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:15.520
then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise, you
are not. On a Diwali day, you have to promise

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:25.590
ourselves that whatever we are going to get
now, as Lakshmi principle or as a Lakshmi’s

01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:41.470
prasad, should be used in getting things which
has value and thus you will learn that you

01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:49.280
have used your Lakshmi very well and with
that, your Mahalakshmi principle will become

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.790
very strong; you’ll become very strong by
which you will ascend very fast.

01:00:53.790 --> 01:01:07.010
Today is the day for us to celebrate the Lakshmi
Puja but Lakshmi Puja doesn’t mean that

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:18.940
you worship money. Money as it is, is the
most dangerous thing and I think it is the

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:29.890
hidden weapon of Lakshmi Devi. See, if you
try to misuse Her, She goes on punching you.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:37.590
With one punch, if you don’t realise then
She gives you another punch. Like that, then

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:45.600
She might little bit twist you to suggest.
She’ll try everything to convince you that

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:54.800
what you are doing is nonsense. Ultimately,
She sees your destruction completely. So,

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:03.930
Lakshmi, though She is the One who is the
giver of boons, giver of everything, you should

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:11.930
not be mislead by Her Mahamaya character.
I’m your Mother, so I better tell you to

01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:18.100
be very careful! Thank you very much.
