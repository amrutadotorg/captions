00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:29.781
Something wrong.

00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:34.438
Who has made those with the things…
(hindi).

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.079
You should put more of cotton in that,
you see, slips back. (Hindi)

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:50.853
Can you get it done by the… (hindi).

00:04:13.234 --> 00:04:15.617
You for pujas you must use Indian girls,
better,

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:18.257
they know all these things better you see.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:23.341
They said that nobody asked us, so
they just sit on the fence.

00:06:16.202 --> 00:06:20.355
They would think that we should not come
forward, because they’ll think

00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:23.730
these people are talking too much,
these Indians,

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.614
so… I mean, they – when they have to come
they should come.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.051
You can see, yesterday’s film, that we
have a tradition,

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:42.151
you see, we know all these things, isn’t it?
This has been there in that country,

00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:48.844
so they should tell you, and you should
not mind that.

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:56.094
They also have the same fear as you have
that they will say “You have a ego”.

00:06:56.487 --> 00:07:01.091
I don’t know how to go about with anything.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.656
It’s quite warm. (Hindi)

00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:49.312
It’s alright.

00:10:05.059 --> 00:10:10.253
I’ll teach you how to make this, alright?
May God bless you.

00:10:28.725 --> 00:10:34.911
Today I was thinking that we’ll do the puja
to Mahalakshmi. Will be better,

00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:41.206
so that we'll understand what is Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma is.

00:10:44.634 --> 00:10:51.232
As you know, the Mahalakshmi principle lies
within all of you, in the center.

00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:57.879
And once you are fed up with the falsehood,

00:10:58.079 --> 00:11:05.050
and also with the hypocrisy of people,

00:11:06.044 --> 00:11:10.705
you start seeking the truth within.

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:18.219
That's how a new category of people are
born, who are called as seekers - sadhakas.

00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:22.382
They are very different from others.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:30.834
They don't care for any material gain

00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:39.691
or any power, position.

00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:48.161
They want to seek the truth and this
category is the one you are,

00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:52.379
and that's why you have come to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:11:53.309 --> 00:11:57.692
This comes from your past lives also.

00:11:57.892 --> 00:12:00.868
For many people, I think, it's their
past life

00:12:01.068 --> 00:12:04.764
which has brought this seeking in them.

00:12:04.964 --> 00:12:10.577
Also the affluence through which you have
gone, you got fed up with it,

00:12:10.777 --> 00:12:14.704
and you are seeking the truth.

00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:21.839
Also, there are people, like in India,
where the tradition is to seek the truth,

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:25.906
from very childhood you are told that money
is not everything,

00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:29.425
power is not everything, it’s all falsehood,
you must seek the truth.

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:31.478
So, you are ingrained with it.

00:12:31.678 --> 00:12:36.744
These are called as good conditionings,
'su-sanskara'.

00:12:36.944 --> 00:12:51.277
Now, if it is the - just a fashion sort
of a thing,

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.863
that you get into fashion, that let us seek
the truth

00:12:56.063 --> 00:13:02.071
because everybody is talking about truth,
let us have this as a fashion

00:13:02.271 --> 00:13:05.979
because everybody is doing it, you see.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:15.311
Then it can be very dangerous. Such people
get lost.

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:22.236
I've seen people who were drug addicts,
who came to us first in England.

00:13:22.947 --> 00:13:25.927
And I was surprised that they were really
seekers,

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:30.417
and they were not taking drugs because
of fashion.

00:13:30.617 --> 00:13:34.375
They were just taking it, because they
thought, by taking drugs,

00:13:34.575 --> 00:13:39.687
they will get into their Mahalakshmi
principle.

00:13:40.396 --> 00:13:45.754
Very intelligent, educated, very smart,
I should say,

00:13:45.954 --> 00:13:50.599
people became hippies and they started
taking drugs.

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:58.482
I discovered that their seeking was only
that they should find the truth.

00:13:58.682 --> 00:14:03.038
But they had no idea as to what is
the truth is.

00:14:03.238 --> 00:14:07.794
So, this Mahalakshmi principle was born
within them.

00:14:07.994 --> 00:14:10.983
Sort of started manifesting,

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:15.572
that 'beyond all this there must be
something'.

00:14:17.307 --> 00:14:22.955
This category of people are everywhere
in the world.

00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:30.587
Especially, I was surprised, in Russia,
where there is no talk of God,

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:33.838
there is no talk of religion.

00:14:35.694 --> 00:14:41.864
They are even better than Indians in
understanding Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:49.558
So the conditionings of every country
has also hampered

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:55.205
the progress of Sahaja Yoga within you
and outside.

00:14:56.268 --> 00:15:00.143
So now, first of all to understand
Mahalakshmi principle

00:15:00.343 --> 00:15:05.297
we must know that we have two other
channels into which we can jump.

00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:08.187
One is the left another is the right

00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:13.515
and it depends on what sort of a background
you had in this life.

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:17.411
Because of your background in last life,
you have come to the right path.

00:15:17.611 --> 00:15:24.028
But last life is been (being?) covered
by this life.

00:15:24.228 --> 00:15:29.992
The surroundings, the country in which you
are born, your friends, parents,

00:15:30.192 --> 00:15:37.659
the society in which you lived, has
dominated you in so many ways

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:48.797
that the Mahalakshmi principle doesn't
express itself in that full power

00:15:48.997 --> 00:15:52.680
which should really suck in everything else

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:58.693
and put you onto the throne of a sahaja yogi.

00:16:00.162 --> 00:16:05.169
So you find people - yesterday there were
so many people for example,

00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:11.923
very nice people, they were all seekers
of many lives who came there,

00:16:12.123 --> 00:16:18.561
but we do not know how many will come
to Sahaja Yoga

00:16:18.761 --> 00:16:23.081
and how many will settle down in Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:24.198 --> 00:16:31.290
how many will achieve doubtless awareness.

00:16:31.856 --> 00:16:39.694
Again the same problem, that they
start getting

00:16:40.448 --> 00:16:45.716
into the habits formed by the left side

00:16:45.916 --> 00:16:51.808
or into the ego formed by the right side.

00:16:52.008 --> 00:16:56.892
Now for a Sahaja Yogi to keep his
Mahalakshmi principle all right -

00:16:57.092 --> 00:17:03.184
has to always introspect, not to look
at others but to introspect.

00:17:03.384 --> 00:17:05.885
"What am I doing?

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:11.881
Am I in the left side or on the right side?

00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.515
Which side [am] I moving?

00:17:14.715 --> 00:17:23.254
What side I’m following? Am I in the center?"

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:31.468
Now how will you judge? The best is to feel
your vibrations,

00:17:31.668 --> 00:17:37.685
feel your vibrations. But sometimes you
go so far

00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:42.171
to the left or to the right, that you just
do not feel vibrations.

00:17:42.371 --> 00:17:46.912
Your Mahalakshmi principle is not working.

00:17:47.112 --> 00:17:52.626
Then you go on. It's like a complete
derailment, I should say,

00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:58.178
a kind of a slope on which you just go on
falling on to that.

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:02.894
So all these conditionings we should
watch out,

00:18:03.094 --> 00:18:07.532
in ourselves and in others - how we have
got these problems

00:18:07.732 --> 00:18:12.711
that we slip out from the central path.
Imagine a train is going

00:18:12.911 --> 00:18:19.034
on a proper railway track and suddenly
it starts moving this way or that way.

00:18:19.234 --> 00:18:25.389
So, where will it end up? Into destruction
going. But you have a way

00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:32.921
of arranging that this derailment can be
brought back to the middle path.

00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:38.867
So in a very detached way if you look
at yourself like a witness

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:42.232
and see for yourself, not about others...
even when I give lectures

00:18:42.432 --> 00:18:44.284
people start saying, "Oh Mother is saying
about somebody else."

00:18:44.484 --> 00:18:49.010
No, I am saying about you, yourself.
So you watch out that,

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:56.766
"Are you in the center or are you going
to the left or to the right."

00:18:57.173 --> 00:19:03.500
First of all, those who are in the center
should not have any physical problems.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.833
Should be able to completely cure
themselves.

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:13.373
If not others, they should be able to cure
themselves.

00:19:13.573 --> 00:19:22.754
Secondly, a person who is in the center
is a very peaceful person.

00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:27.065
He is never angry. He might put up a show
that you are angry.

00:19:27.265 --> 00:19:33.126
But he doesn't get involved into anger
or any emotions whatsoever.

00:19:33.326 --> 00:19:41.328
He just watches and he can act. He can act
to be in that feeling

00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:49.191
of temper also lust, greed, anything -
but just to act.

00:19:49.391 --> 00:19:54.250
Because sometimes this acting is needed
so he can use it.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.386
But you should be sure, first of all, that
you are completely detached.

00:19:58.586 --> 00:20:03.492
So first of all, before acting you must
become a master of acting.

00:20:03.692 --> 00:20:10.522
And for that you have to become your Self.
If you become your Self

00:20:10.722 --> 00:20:18.211
then you are a master and you can see
where are you going.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:26.521
Now the difference between a sahaja yogi
and a sahaja yogi who is like this,

00:20:26.721 --> 00:20:32.816
as you say, is this, that he is capable
of going to the left or to the right.

00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:36.581
They are not solidly sahaja yogis,

00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:40.318
and they go on like this and there is
no progress. Imagine

00:20:40.518 --> 00:20:43.815
any airplane which is wobbling like that:
will be on the ground only.

00:20:44.015 --> 00:20:50.644
Nobody will be able to put it up in the air,

00:20:50.844 --> 00:20:55.155
because God knows what time -
when will it fall down.

00:20:55.355 --> 00:20:59.185
So for any machinery, we have to fix it up
properly first,

00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:05.036
before we start working it out.
To fix up our

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.223
Mahalakshmi principle, you have to see
that your physical being

00:21:11.423 --> 00:21:14.590
is all right, is normal, no problem.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.651
I am not meaning the modern ways
of looking at health

00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:22.002
but that you should feel healthy and happy.

00:21:22.202 --> 00:21:26.582
You should feel that there is no problem
with your physical being.

00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:30.915
But if you are a complaining type (like)
I am here paining, I’m paining there,

00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:34.299
then there is something wrong with you.

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:42.967
This is the first criteria that you are
in the center.

00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:50.130
Then your attention should be more
towards nature -

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.690
how the nature is, how it is blossoming,
how it is working out.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.312
It should be towards the sky, stars
and things.

00:21:59.512 --> 00:22:04.502
Just to enjoy all the creation that is
around, just to enjoy it.

00:22:04.702 --> 00:22:11.486
That’s an enjoyment which is really
so surprisingly deep.

00:22:11.686 --> 00:22:15.199
When you see something, beautiful scene
or something -

00:22:15.399 --> 00:22:21.266
you go to a very beautiful place, then
a kind of a joy that pours in you

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:25.835
from your Sahastrara, that also you
must experience.

00:22:26.035 --> 00:22:29.311
Also you must experience your thoughtless
awareness,

00:22:29.511 --> 00:22:34.648
that is when you look at something beautiful
you should suddenly become thoughtless.

00:22:34.848 --> 00:22:41.549
Just start seeing it. The whole joy will
start pouring on you.

00:22:41.749 --> 00:22:49.596
Then another thing is that you should not
differentiate between religions.

00:22:49.796 --> 00:22:53.063
You should not condemn any religion.

00:22:53.263 --> 00:22:58.090
But the people who are stupid and call
themselves religious,

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.733
they can be condemned, because they are
stupid.

00:23:00.933 --> 00:23:04.059
They have not followed the principle
of religion at all.

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:09.431
They are not realized souls and that's what
they are making a mistake.

00:23:09.631 --> 00:23:13.769
So that's all right. For example churches
can be condemned,

00:23:13.969 --> 00:23:19.874
but not Christ, not the Bible, not at all,
never.

00:23:20.074 --> 00:23:24.517
So, when you see to the roots - roots are
all right, but now as I said,

00:23:24.717 --> 00:23:29.103
that these flowers have been plucked
by people and they are fighting.

00:23:29.303 --> 00:23:33.601
So you should never condemn any incarnation,

00:23:33.801 --> 00:23:39.943
any religion, any prophet.

00:23:40.143 --> 00:23:43.197
I mean you will not condemn. It is not
question of I’m saying, "Don't do it".

00:23:43.397 --> 00:23:47.774
You will just not do it. You will respect
all of them automatically,

00:23:47.974 --> 00:23:52.272
because now you are born into it. If you,
say, are a Christian,

00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.420
you will respect Hindu scriptures.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:59.357
If you are a Hindu you’ll respect
an Islamic Quran.

00:23:59.557 --> 00:24:02.326
That has to be there. If it is not so,

00:24:02.526 --> 00:24:07.087
then please know that you are not yet a sahaja yogi.

00:24:07.287 --> 00:24:11.515
There should be no malice about any
religion whatsoever.

00:24:11.715 --> 00:24:14.920
No religion has done any wrong so far.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.320
It's the people who follow them in a wrong
way, use it for money,

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:26.288
use it for power and also are stupid.
For them it's different.

00:24:26.488 --> 00:24:32.444
But for you, every religion is your
own religion.

00:24:32.644 --> 00:24:36.336
So we cannot be fundamentalist.

00:24:36.536 --> 00:24:39.841
We cannot fight for fundamentalism.

00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:44.687
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma which is based
on the Mahalakshmi principle,

00:24:44.887 --> 00:24:52.418
is the essence of all the religions,
the truth of all the religions.

00:24:52.618 --> 00:24:58.208
And we seek with our pursuits

00:24:58.408 --> 00:25:03.092
what are the common points in all these
religions. We try to neutralise

00:25:03.292 --> 00:25:06.850
which are not common points

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.598
and find out with our research/pursuits

00:25:11.798 --> 00:25:18.896
that this one was not the correct thing,
but is not in the religion,

00:25:19.096 --> 00:25:24.704
people are following like that. There are
so many things you can find out.

00:25:24.904 --> 00:25:31.385
If in the Bible, if you remove Paul
you will cleanse most of it.

00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:35.643
If Paul is not there, I tell you, most
of the Christianity can be cleansed out,

00:25:35.843 --> 00:25:39.664
because he started confessions, he started
all this nonsense.

00:25:39.864 --> 00:25:42.967
He started making people feel guilty,
I mean,

00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:47.391
and treating women as nothing.
All Mr. Paul has done it

00:25:47.591 --> 00:25:52.692
and he had no right to be there in the
Bible ibecause he never knew Christ.

00:25:53.755 --> 00:25:58.116
He was an epileptic and he saw some cross
means some sort of a...

00:25:58.316 --> 00:26:04.259
I don't know how far it is truth. But he
said he saw a cross. So what?

00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:08.041
Seeing the cross doesn't mean you become
the cross.

00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:15.133
Also he wanted to jump on the platform.
Nice platform is made, all right, for you.

00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:23.853
And he has powers, and he wants to have
powers, so, he jumps on the platform.

00:26:24.053 --> 00:26:28.412
Then he organizes Christianity.
All his mistery.

00:26:28.612 --> 00:26:31.414
Never in the Bible is said, never
Christ said,

00:26:31.614 --> 00:26:36.078
that you should organize Christianity,
nor has He said

00:26:36.278 --> 00:26:40.866
that you should confess or you should
feel guilty.

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:45.079
All the time He has been talking
of forgiveness.

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:49.016
In that short time also, He has given
the truth to us.

00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:56.970
But I mean, if somebody wants to interpret,
then it goes wrong.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:02.181
So this - another point of a sahaja yogi is,
whatever I say

00:27:02.381 --> 00:27:06.796
they don't have to interpret, they know it
exactly what I say.

00:27:06.996 --> 00:27:11.125
If they start interpreting, then there is
something wrong with them.

00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:15.407
Their brains are not all right, they are
not normal. You cannot interpret Me.

00:27:15.607 --> 00:27:19.025
Whatever I say, I say in a very simple
English language.

00:27:19.225 --> 00:27:22.255
I do not use Shakespearean language
or something like that.

00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:30.078
I modulated My Standard of English up to
the normal common people’s language,

00:27:30.278 --> 00:27:33.344
and if you start interpreting it,

00:27:33.544 --> 00:27:38.249
that means something definitely very,
very wrong with you.

00:27:38.449 --> 00:27:41.696
There is nothing to interpret. I am saying
straightforward things

00:27:41.896 --> 00:27:46.586
which need not be interpreted. This is
a very important thing.

00:27:46.786 --> 00:27:53.535
But many sahaja yogi's who are half-baked,
I should say, start interpreting Me,

00:27:53.735 --> 00:27:56.114
because they think they have brains
to interpret.

00:27:56.314 --> 00:28:02.561
You have no brains of that caliber that
you can interpret Me.

00:28:02.761 --> 00:28:06.227
There are no interpretations. Whatever
I have said, I have said it

00:28:06.427 --> 00:28:09.148
and there is no need to interpret.

00:28:09.348 --> 00:28:13.210
This is one of the signs that you are
not in the center.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.872
Either you have been possessed or you
have become egoistical.

00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:26.270
So, one, to keep yourself in the center,
to be solidly sahaja yogis,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:31.040
first of all there should be no
interpretations of what I say.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.062
If you think that I am meaning something
else, you can write to Me,

00:28:35.262 --> 00:28:39.582
but don't interpret and start a big
organization

00:28:39.782 --> 00:28:47.261
against Sahaja Yoga. This is the greatest
mistake that people do it.

00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:51.917
I have told many people that you should not
give lectures about Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:52.117 --> 00:28:55.132
Because once they start giving lectures,
also sometimes they get

00:28:55.332 --> 00:29:00.223
into derailment. Either they get egoistical
or they say things,

00:29:00.423 --> 00:29:05.743
as they say, out of their hats, which I
have never said, which are not to be said.

00:29:05.943 --> 00:29:09.301
So unless and until you are a solid
sahaja yogi,

00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:13.364
I think you should not talk about Sahaja
Yoga. Best is to give realization.

00:29:13.564 --> 00:29:19.237
Though you are half-baked, you can give
realization. That's one point for sure.

00:29:19.437 --> 00:29:22.675
And those who will get will remain
sahaja yogis.

00:29:22.875 --> 00:29:27.153
I have seen people who have given
realization to others are gone cases,

00:29:27.353 --> 00:29:32.078
while those whom they have given
are perfect.

00:29:34.448 --> 00:29:39.023
Now when somebody gives you
the realization, he is not your guru

00:29:39.223 --> 00:29:45.110
by any chance. He is not your guru and have
no sort of a awe

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.102
or an obligation towards that person
who has given you realization.

00:29:50.302 --> 00:29:55.830
If you do that way, then the ego
of that man wouldn't go away

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.458
and you will have conditioning.

00:29:59.658 --> 00:30:02.967
You will always stand by that person
though he has done wrong.

00:30:03.167 --> 00:30:05.941
Though he is absolutely not a sahaja yogi,
you will stand by that person.

00:30:06.141 --> 00:30:11.332
With him you also move to the direction
in which he has moved.

00:30:11.532 --> 00:30:15.667
So in Mahalakshmi principle, one has
to be careful, absolutely,

00:30:15.867 --> 00:30:19.391
to see where are we going.

00:30:21.228 --> 00:30:24.657
Now the group system starts, also with
the same.

00:30:24.857 --> 00:30:29.395
There is a big fraternity of 'bhoots',
I must tell you.

00:30:31.326 --> 00:30:35.049
If you go to the left, all the leftist
will join you.

00:30:35.249 --> 00:30:38.244
If you go to the right, all the rightist
will join you.

00:30:38.444 --> 00:30:42.664
Then they’ll fight among themselves
and get out of it.

00:30:43.728 --> 00:30:49.743
Now for sahaja yogis, who believe
in fighting back, in grouping back,

00:30:49.943 --> 00:30:53.984
they should know, they have derailed.
Maybe they were very intelligent,

00:30:54.184 --> 00:30:58.662
they thought they could do that, maybe.
But none intelligence,

00:30:58.862 --> 00:31:04.033
none of them are above the Divine
intelligence.

00:31:04.233 --> 00:31:06.987
But when you start moving out
of Mahalakshmi thing,

00:31:07.187 --> 00:31:12.314
you become like a common person, even
worse than a common person, I would say.

00:31:12.514 --> 00:31:18.963
So then you are grabbed by the negative
forces which are around us.

00:31:19.163 --> 00:31:25.686
Just like all others are grabbed, you are
also grabbed.

00:31:26.091 --> 00:31:32.463
There are conditionings, which also
we should see “do we have”.

00:31:32.663 --> 00:31:37.532
Say a western person must see western
conditionings

00:31:37.732 --> 00:31:40.628
very clearly. What are these
conditionings? Because we are

00:31:40.828 --> 00:31:45.036
seekers of truth, we do not belong
to any country. We belong

00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:49.509
to the universe, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.
We do not belong to Australia,

00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:53.453
we do not belong to Brisbane. You see
this belonging

00:31:53.653 --> 00:31:58.651
becomes so small and so mean that
ultimately it will become, we belong

00:31:58.851 --> 00:32:04.640
to this street and then we belong to this
room, and we belong to this bathroom.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.868
Start going down, down, down, so much.

00:32:08.068 --> 00:32:12.663
While is it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. Means
it is a universal religion,

00:32:12.863 --> 00:32:17.195
we belong to the universe. We are part
and parcel of the universe,

00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:23.352
not only belonging to one place or one
location. We cannot.

00:32:23.552 --> 00:32:28.673
Now we have gone into eternal life. We have
gone to something that is unlimited.

00:32:28.873 --> 00:32:31.584
So we belong to this universe.

00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:35.796
Once you realize that you belong to this
universe, you should also know

00:32:35.996 --> 00:32:39.822
what conditionings are still sticking on
to us

00:32:40.022 --> 00:32:46.421
from this country, from this culture,
from this place,

00:32:46.621 --> 00:32:49.869
from this household, from this family,

00:32:50.069 --> 00:32:54.319
like a little lotus that comes out
of the mud.

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:59.014
Slowly, slowly it throws away all the mud
that is sticking on to it.

00:32:59.214 --> 00:33:04.674
Ultimately it comes out as a very
clean flower.

00:33:04.874 --> 00:33:08.263
From the mud it gets to the water,
cleanses itself

00:33:08.463 --> 00:33:12.409
and comes out as a beautiful flower,
absolutely fragrant,

00:33:12.609 --> 00:33:16.126
and then it spreads its fragrance
all around,

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:21.060
so that, that mud also gets fragrance.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.445
That's your job. That’s what you have
to be.

00:33:25.645 --> 00:33:29.781
Because you are not a seeker of truth
for yourself but for the whole world.

00:33:29.981 --> 00:33:33.084
Because you belong to Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:33:33.284 --> 00:33:39.167
This Mahalakshmi principle is not for you
alone, but it is for the whole world,

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:44.111
and you have to give it to the whole world.
So now you are here

00:33:44.311 --> 00:33:49.513
forming a new kind of a race, a new kind
of a society,

00:33:49.713 --> 00:33:58.779
which is enlightened, which is standing
on the truth and love.

00:33:59.336 --> 00:34:05.749
Of course, you must understand that
there should be compassion.

00:34:05.949 --> 00:34:11.819
Look at that child, my God!

00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:19.836
That’s another condition of the children
here. They must do something to get hurt.

00:34:20.036 --> 00:34:24.781
It’s very common. All the time, they do
things that will hurt them.

00:34:24.981 --> 00:34:28.566
They cannot sit quiet. It’s very surprising.

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:32.875
In India you find children will sit quiet
for three hours - four hours,

00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:37.159
as long as the pujas are. Now here
the children are, I don't know

00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:41.187
but I am going to find out a solution
for this. They just cannot keep quiet.

00:34:41.387 --> 00:34:46.785
And now in America, they are suffering
from overactivity, is a disease,

00:34:46.985 --> 00:34:50.165
it is a disease now. They don't know what
to do with the overactive children.

00:34:50.365 --> 00:34:57.415
They are overactive. But I think I'll be
able to find out some solution for that.

00:34:57.615 --> 00:35:02.790
But as far as you are concerned you are
your own solution.

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:12.214
You can watch yourself. You want to be people
who are spiritually very well equipped.

00:35:12.414 --> 00:35:17.060
For that equipment you must see yourself,
where are you,

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:23.881
what are you doing? What's your style
of life?

00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:28.351
A solid sahaja yogi or a yogini everyone
knows all over the world.

00:35:28.551 --> 00:35:33.109
They are solid. Nothing can deter them.

00:35:34.141 --> 00:35:38.306
And you can also know about yourself.
It’s not that you cannot know.

00:35:38.506 --> 00:35:45.489
All of you can know yourself very well
because now you are quite sensitive

00:35:45.689 --> 00:35:50.115
and you have your own centers enlightened
by Mahalakshmi principle.

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:56.685
The Kundalini has definitely enlightened
your Mahalakshmi principle.

00:35:56.885 --> 00:36:00.399
So you can always make out where are we,
what my chakras are,

00:36:00.599 --> 00:36:06.366
how are they catching, where are they
catching. Instead of avoiding that,

00:36:06.566 --> 00:36:11.438
you just work it out - what's the problem,
where is the problem?

00:36:11.638 --> 00:36:16.571
Once you work it out then you will be
surprised that,

00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:22.086
as soon as your desire goes inward,

00:36:22.286 --> 00:36:28.426
the Kundalini itself will rush through
and She will cleanse your chakras.

00:36:28.626 --> 00:36:31.868
As I was telling you, we do not know
our powers.

00:36:32.068 --> 00:36:36.919
Only one thing you have to do is
to desire. You have to desire that,

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:42.088
let my vibrations be all right,
let my chakras be cleared out,

00:36:42.288 --> 00:36:47.296
let me be in the center, in the balance.
Just you have to desire.

00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:52.949
I mean it’s such a simple thing to desire.
But that also we cannot do.

00:36:53.149 --> 00:36:57.312
Our desires are something else.
Not what we have to be.

00:36:57.512 --> 00:37:03.870
Just you have to desire that: let me be
a clean sahaja ogi.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.827
Let me be a solid Sahaja Yogi.
There are mediocres

00:37:08.027 --> 00:37:12.154
who can never be. I am not talking
about them. But so many

00:37:12.354 --> 00:37:18.452
can be very high up, can be very high up
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:18.652 --> 00:37:23.568
But their desires are not yet being
fully manifested. .

00:37:23.768 --> 00:37:30.767
Then there is a damping effect of so many
things I have told you about.

00:37:30.967 --> 00:37:33.974
So supposing you have to catch the plane,

00:37:34.174 --> 00:37:38.095
then you don't get down on the way
somewhere and stay out.

00:37:38.295 --> 00:37:41.559
In the same way, when your Kundalini
has to rise,

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:45.556
you can see everything that’s happening.
But keep yourself aloof,

00:37:45.756 --> 00:37:48.436
because you have to reach your point
and that is

00:37:48.636 --> 00:37:55.851
through this Mahalakshmi principle.
It is a principle that is so detached.

00:37:56.051 --> 00:37:59.468
It is the nourishing principle within us,

00:37:59.668 --> 00:38:03.895
which nourishes our centers, which
nourishes our character,

00:38:04.095 --> 00:38:08.965
which nourishes our religion, that is
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:38:09.165 --> 00:38:14.054
It nourishes everything. It nourishes
our brain, our intellect,

00:38:14.254 --> 00:38:19.140
everything, it nourishes this Mahalakshmi
principle, above all

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.765
it is the balancing. It balances you.

00:38:23.965 --> 00:38:31.448
If you are overdoing something, then
it gives you a kind of a push.

00:38:31.648 --> 00:38:38.787
If you are not doing anything, again it
works in such a manner that it balances you.

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:43.882
So this is the guiding factor for you,
this Mahalakshmi principle,

00:38:44.082 --> 00:38:48.715
which works out everything you can say

00:38:48.915 --> 00:38:55.570
that is balancing, the equilibrium
and the wisdom.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:03.257
As the light of Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the wisdom dawns upon you.

00:39:03.457 --> 00:39:08.831
But the greatest of all is the love.
Love for God,

00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:16.530
love for truth and you thrive on that love.
Just you are there.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:19.412
I mean, I asked him, "Why so many
are here?" They said,

00:39:19.612 --> 00:39:25.348
for the puja. Why? This is a sign that
you are great sahaja yogis,

00:39:25.548 --> 00:39:29.697
that you are here because of puja, that
you understand the value of puja

00:39:29.897 --> 00:39:34.611
and that you need the puja, that you enjoy
because it is nourishing to you.

00:39:34.811 --> 00:39:41.141
Is a very good thing because that shows
that you are very much there.

00:39:41.341 --> 00:39:45.019
You are very much understanding
the importance of right things

00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:49.136
and you want to do it at any cost.

00:39:49.336 --> 00:39:56.209
All these desires are significant because
they show that you are

00:39:56.409 --> 00:40:01.550
in the Mahalakshmi principle and you want
to keep on that one.

00:40:02.738 --> 00:40:10.020
I would say, there is a simple one that
you can do is just to be on My Kundalini.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.987
If you can, just try to be in My Kundalini

00:40:14.187 --> 00:40:16.813
- on My Kundalini. Just put attention.
You can, all of you can.

00:40:17.013 --> 00:40:21.400
Any problem, just put your attention onto
My Kundalini. And you will be all right.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.209
You will just become thoughtless, because
there is no thought.

00:40:28.764 --> 00:40:32.938
This is the best way to do it, is to just
solve all problems

00:40:33.138 --> 00:40:39.641
by putting attention on My Kundalini and
by that your ego will definitely dissolve,

00:40:39.841 --> 00:40:42.546
because then you will know that Mother
is doing everything, I am doing nothing,

00:40:42.746 --> 00:40:46.498
so why should I be proud of it.

00:40:46.698 --> 00:40:51.550
Also the conditionings will dissolve because

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:58.107
my Kundalini is absolutely pure. That’s -
It is not attached to anyone.

00:40:58.307 --> 00:41:03.281
It is not even attached to Sahaja Yoga.
It is not attached to anyone.

00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:07.383
The job it has got to do is to nourish
everything.

00:41:07.583 --> 00:41:12.708
If it can nourish well and good. If it does
not nourish, well and good.

00:41:12.908 --> 00:41:16.971
It depends on what do you want. You want
to be nourished - all right,

00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:22.027
so the Kundalini is there, the Mahalakshmi
principle is there. It will nourish you.

00:41:22.227 --> 00:41:26.323
But if you don't want, nobody is going
to force you in any way.

00:41:26.523 --> 00:41:32.649
Nobody is going to jump on you or form
some sort of a formidable oppression.

00:41:32.849 --> 00:41:35.109
Nothing of the kind.

00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:40.202
It's just like a river Ganges, you can say,
which is flowing.

00:41:40.402 --> 00:41:44.991
Now if you want you can fill up your
pitchers.

00:41:45.191 --> 00:41:48.408
If you don't want, She is not going
to enter into your pitchers.

00:41:48.608 --> 00:41:52.828
She is not going to come in your house
and get into your pitchers.

00:41:53.028 --> 00:42:00.979
So there has to be a desire to get it and
that is what is called is 'Bhakti'.

00:42:01.179 --> 00:42:07.781
'Bhakti' is the desire, the devotion to get

00:42:10.804 --> 00:42:16.002
the joy of Bhakti. It's such a beautiful
thing.

00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:21.156
I wish, I could do the Bhakti to someone,
but I can't do.

00:42:21.356 --> 00:42:24.876
Because I see you, when you are in Bhakti,
you just get lost into it.

00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:28.900
So much you enjoy, such an enjoyable thing.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.904
Then you don't think, you just enjoy
the Bhakti.

00:42:32.104 --> 00:42:40.665
And that’s what is the most coveted,
highest state

00:42:40.865 --> 00:42:47.477
where you are just one with the divine
and just swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:42:47.677 --> 00:42:50.856
So this Mahalakshmi principle is to be
preserved

00:42:51.056 --> 00:42:55.416
and has to be always watched
and looked into.

00:42:55.616 --> 00:42:59.318
And the blessings of Mahalakshmi are
so many that,

00:42:59.518 --> 00:43:01.823
I tell you, I cannot even tell them

00:43:02.023 --> 00:43:04.516
in one lecture. I'll have to give at least
ten lectures.

00:43:04.716 --> 00:43:10.204
But you yourself know what are the blessings
of this Mahalakshmi principle is.

00:43:10.404 --> 00:43:14.691
The greatest is the complete
self-contentedness,

00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:18.175
is absolutely self-contented.

00:43:18.375 --> 00:43:24.928
You don't want to grab something, you
don't want to run after something,

00:43:25.128 --> 00:43:29.152
you are just self contended. You don't
want any publicity,

00:43:29.352 --> 00:43:37.133
you don't want any comfort, nothing.
You are comfortable in your spirit.

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:42.979
This is the greatest blessing of this
Mahalakshmi principle,

00:43:43.179 --> 00:43:49.477
and if that is so, then why not we look
after our Mahalakshmi principle

00:43:49.677 --> 00:43:52.951
and forget about the rest.

00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:57.094
Last of all, when it enters into your brain,

00:43:57.294 --> 00:44:06.847
then the Virata is manifesting and you
become collective, absolutely collective.

00:44:07.498 --> 00:44:10.365
It’s such a beautiful thing
is to be collective.

00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:13.203
There was a girl who went to Sicily

00:44:13.403 --> 00:44:16.584
and she was in a restaurant eating
something alone.

00:44:16.784 --> 00:44:21.893
And then she looked at somebody else
and that girl also looked at her.

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:27.630
And this one got up and came to her and
she said... they were not wearing badges.

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:34.483
They said, 'Have you been to Shri Mataji -
Yes, Have you been - Yes.'

00:44:34.683 --> 00:44:39.971
'We are Sahaja Yogis - Yes.' And then they
just embraced each other with such joy.

00:44:40.171 --> 00:44:45.663
In a far-fetched place somewhere in Sicily,
in some restaurant, imagine!

00:44:45.863 --> 00:44:51.861
They just got lost. The feeling of fondness,
the brotherhood, the friendship

00:44:52.062 --> 00:44:57.649
is so great and so joyous. You don't then
consider from what country you are,

00:44:57.849 --> 00:45:00.680
from where do you come, what is
the color of your skin,

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.887
or what is the religion you had followed,

00:45:04.087 --> 00:45:10.730
what your parents are. You just enjoy
meeting people.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:17.154
This friendship, this joy comes from
the same Mahalakshmi principle,

00:45:17.354 --> 00:45:21.893
when She enlightens your Sahastrara.

00:45:22.093 --> 00:45:26.415
In the Sahastrara you get this feeling
of the whole

00:45:26.615 --> 00:45:30.078
and the feeling of the whole is something
so great.

00:45:30.278 --> 00:45:34.090
Individualism, people talk, but it is
against the principle of whole.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:38.518
Who do not know the whole you see
talk of individualism.

00:45:38.718 --> 00:45:44.382
This individualism which has worked
all kinds of dangers for us -

00:45:44.582 --> 00:45:48.122
now, we have to know that we are one
with the whole.

00:45:48.322 --> 00:45:55.840
Of course, we are individuals in the sense
that we have different, different faces,

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.940
different clothes, different living,
different relationships,

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:04.634
but we belong to the whole.

00:46:05.439 --> 00:46:10.534
And this Virata’s feeling that we are part
and parcel of the whole

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:15.178
gives you complete peace and complete
protection.

00:46:15.378 --> 00:46:20.925
You never feel that something can happen
to you – never feel.

00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:24.351
Some accident will take place, all right,
will take place,

00:46:24.551 --> 00:46:28.003
but nothing will happen to me.
I am a sahaja yogi.

00:46:28.817 --> 00:46:34.002
So many people have gained like this,
by allowing themselves

00:46:34.202 --> 00:46:39.540
to be completely looked after by this
Mahalakshmi principle.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:44.808
Just surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle
means that you give up your ego

00:46:45.008 --> 00:46:49.026
and you give up your conditionings.
You give up both the things.

00:46:49.226 --> 00:46:51.672
Just surrendering to your Mahalakshmi
principle.

00:46:51.872 --> 00:46:56.008
That's why Mahalakshmi is so important.

00:46:57.027 --> 00:46:58.261
May God bless you all.
