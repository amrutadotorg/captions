00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.892
…Thank you. Come along. See those who are… You come in front, all right?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.892
Better thing is that the new people sit in front. It’s better. Yes. Hello. Good. Very good.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.892
So I would like to give you a little idea about this picture that we have in front of us (chakra chart).

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.892
Now whom we call as God Almighty, the One who is eternal, who doesn’t incarnate,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.892
who is all the time there watching the play of His Power, the Primordial Mother,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.892
is manifested through to Her Power into His three aspects here, clearly, within ourselves

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.892
and within the Primordial Being who is the ultimate which all the created people have to reach.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.892
Now there’s a difference between the two, the Almighty, God, as you call Him,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.892
the One who never incarnates, and the One who incarnates on this Earth

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.892
and occupies a position like this, just like a human being,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.892
and He’s called as a Primordial Being or you can say the Viraata,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.892
you can call Him the Viraat. Actually, though He’s called as ‘Primordial Being’,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.892
He’s an aspect of God. So these are two things if you understand,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.892
I will be able to explain to you how the aspects of God are expressed in us.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.892
So the first aspect of God is His desire to create,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.892
His desire to create and in His desire to create …

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.892
(Oh, you were outside there Linda, I didn’t recognise. Come along, I’m sorry

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.892
I didn’t recognise you, I never recognised you, I’m sorry, I never recognised. I thought,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.892
“Who is this one?” I’m sorry. So, this side would be better.)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.892
So His desire to manifest, His desire to create,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.892
that’s the aspect within us which is represented by this blue colour line

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.892
which is called as the Adi Ida Nadi, or you can call it the primordial Ida channel by which He desires.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.892
Now as a desire can be born and can be finished off, can be switched off, in the same way,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.892
His desire to create also can be over. His desire to create any more may be over.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.892
His desire not to create for the time being could be there.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.892
So if you understand your desires, you can understand His desire also to create

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.892
and that’s why when He does not desire to have it anymore, the creation He can destroy.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.892
So He is the One through which we exist and through which we are destroyed, too.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.892
So He’s the One who manifests existence and destruction of Creation.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.892
That’s why He is called as Destroyer.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.892
This aspect is represented by the principle of Shiva;

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.892
which never incarnates because this principle is the one which is the germ,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.892
which is the beginning and which is the end of everything.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.892
Like a seed becomes the seed ultimately, in the same way this Shiva Tattwa,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.892
this principle of Shiva, germinates, creates and then it again becomes the same principle.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.892
That’s why the principle of Shiva never changes. It is called as Shiva,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.892
means it is permanent, it is eternal. The rest of Them go into manifestations.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.892
So first He desired and He wanted to create. So He had to have His aspect of Creator being put in

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.892
and the second aspect of Creator (aside: can you show [them]?) is the,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.892
this yellow line that shows here is the Pingala Nadi, called as Adi Pingala,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.892
the Primordial Pingala channel by which He has created this Universe.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.892
Now the centre of this figure you can find this green round circle

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.892
and this one is the one, is the space in which He created.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.892
He created in this space and that’s why this space is called as Bhavasagara.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.892
Is the Ocean of Creation. ‘Bhava’ is the one that is created.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.892
Bhu, Bhava means the one… exactly it is the one that is done;

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:47.892
bhava is done, means created. So the Creator then produces all the stars and the,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.892
all the galaxies, solar plexus, lunar plexuses, all the so-called mandalas. He does all that work.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.892
But as you would say that first of all this blue line, if you follow it up,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.892
goes absolutely to the first centre, here. Now this line represents,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.892
though it manifests the Shiva principle, it is manifested or, you can say, it’s carried on,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.892
through the power of Shiva that is known as Mahakali.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.892
That’s the power of Mahakali which descends up to the lowest point there

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.892
which is the first centre that is created by Mahakali Herself, and this centre is

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.892
called as the Mooladhara Chakra. On this She has created first of all the first deity,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.892
the first we can call the Aradhya Devata. The one deity

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.892
which is to be worshipped first in this whole world is the deity that is the embodiment of innocence.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.892
So innocence was the first thing that was created by God, and not cunningness.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.892
Cunningness is our by-product, you see. He created innocence and holiness

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.892
and that’s how he put the deity there and that deity is called as Shri Ganesha.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.892
It’s a, later on you will know that the same embodiment of innocence

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.892
incarnated on this earth as Jesus Christ. Now this is a very, very important chakra

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.892
or the centre about which I will tell you later on.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.892
But then after creating this, you see, God is a very, I should say, a very, very compassionate

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.892
and affectionate being. He is the source of all our compassion and affection

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.892
because He resides in the heart as Shiva there – you can see His place there.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.892
And then He wanted to produce somebody who would – after creating this.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.892
First He created the chakra for the innocence. That was the most primarily important thing,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.892
was to create innocence on this earth, to protect people. Innocence is auspiciousness,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.892
is called as mangalakari. Is the one that gives you auspiciousness.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.892
Now about auspiciousness also they have had a tape with them, you can ask them what it gives.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.892
And it is a thing that was first created, means

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.892
that for us the blessings were created even before He started creating these galaxies.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.892
So He created a place in the space from where He could emit His blessings on this earth.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.892
So secondly, then, He, before even creating the Creator, He just thought,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.892
“Let Me put Him up. Let Me have another aspect manifested,” which is the central,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.892
centre path, in the – from the centre path which is known as the Sushumna,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.892
is the centre path of sustenance, of your dharma.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.892
Before creating anything else He created this one because this is the centre of seeking,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.892
is the centre of seeking.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.892
And this seeking was created even from the smallest of animals you know.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.892
When amoeba was created he’s had a seeking. Otherwise he would never have evolved.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.892
And the, of course, the seeking changed its mode and its tone but

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.892
there was a seeking first implanted at that point and for that He had to create a deity

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.892
of His aspect of sustenance which was called as Shri Vishnu.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.892
His power is Mahalakshmi which is that channel, is the centre power.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.892
Now the third one that He created out of it actually [UNCLEAR].

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.892
These are from here, what He made first of all from here is very formal

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.892
and [INAUDIBLE for about 15 sec]

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.892
and this power is called as the power of Mahasaraswati.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:01.892
So you have got three powers of Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.892
This universe then was created through galaxies and through many … solar systems

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.892
and if you happen to read one of the so-called article of Mine on solar plexus

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.892
or on the creation itself you will know how we were created very carefully,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.892
how the earth was created, how it was taken away. Part of it was taken away from the sun,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.892
taken very far away first and then adjusted, brought to a point where life could grow.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.892
All that was done and so the earth was created.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.892
Now the first chakra, as I told you, is the Ganesha’s chakra.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:02.892
Now this chakra is most important for us because this is the centre of Shri Ganesha

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.892
who is the son of Mahakali’s residual power which we can call as the Gauri.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.892
It is that, you can see in the centre, it’s also called as the Kundalini.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.892
After creating the whole thing, I mean desiring the whole thing,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:36.892
He put part of that – that’s why we call it residual power – into that Kundalini,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.892
the Adi Kundalini which would record all that is happening within

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.892
and later on when the time comes it would give you your second birth.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.892
So this is the Kundalini here. It is placed in three and a half coil

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.892
because three and a half coil brings forth eternal movement like your watches which are,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.892
say, automatic are… also have got three and a half coils just to put it in automatic way.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.892
That’s how this idea must have come to somebody that we should put three and a half coils

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.892
to have automatic watches, you see. So this is the three and a half coils there placed.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.892
And that’s the Mother.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.892
That’s the Mother. That’s the Virgin. That’s the One sitting down there.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.892
Now this is the Mother who had not yet met Her husband but was married, but still a virgin.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.892
And the story is very interesting how She created Ganesha.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.892
She was worried that somebody may come inside the bathroom so She,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:57.892
out of Her body these things, what you call mala, the dirt on Her body,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.892
She took out some soil or clay that we use in India for washing the hands.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.892
Our clay is very good. And She put all the clay and took it out and made out of that a Ganesha.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.892
And put Him down there, at that point because She wanted somebody to protect Her.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.892
(Somebody has come? If you lock the door, how will I know? It’s all right)

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.892
So this protection was created there for Her.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.892
But actually that’s the One is also protecting Her protocol.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.892
That means this chakra nobody can enter into. Nobody can touch it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.892
Through this centre anybody who tries to come in will be punished.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.892
Now, those people who say that Kundalini can be risen through sex are, I must say,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.892
either sadly mistaken or are sinister people,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.892
because that’s the centre is to protect Her protocol.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.892
He never would allow anybody to enter through that point because that is the point

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.892
which regulates and controls the sex.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.892
So that is a very, very holy place through which you cannot enter.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.892
The reason is, say, if there is mud and if there is all kind of filth,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.892
best thing is to put there the most purest form of deity who’d never gets embellished

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.892
or who does not get hurt or in any way involved into that filth.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.892
So He, being the purest, He was placed there.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.892
Like Christ came on this earth to a place, like horrible place like Bethlehem and all this,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.892
just because there was no other way out, you see. He was the only one who could come there

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.892
and sustain these people who wanted to crucify Him later on.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.892
So He came down later but this embodiment of innocence was put there.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.892
Innocence is a thing which never is cunning and intelligent as you think intelligence

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.892
is supposed to be. It’s very different type of intelligence it has got that it just works out.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.892
You may be any amount of intelligence you may have and you may try to trick the innocence by

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.892
any chances or by any, any sort of fraudulent ways. You cannot cheat.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.892
Innocence is above all that.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.892
And that is what was very important and that’s why He was placed there.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.892
Now the people who have been practicing this kind of a nonsensical stuff like

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.892
going to Kundalini through the sex are really doing a very abusive and horrible thing

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.892
to their own Mother, who is the Kundalini. Kundalini is your Mother.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.892
She has been with you for ages and She has been waiting for this day

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.892
when you could get your Realisation.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.892
So those who try such tricks on the Kundalini, on their Mother,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.892
you can imagine how much they should be punished.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.892
That’s why so many people get all these horrible experiences, of getting blisters in the body,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.892
they get heat in the body, sometimes they get a temperature and they get stuck up

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.892
and all sort of things happen because of this kind of unauthorised behaviour.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.892
The another thing could be to freeze this Ganesha, is to become a person

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.892
who is absolutely running away from sex. One does not have to run away from sex

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.892
because sex is one of the activities of Ganesha because He’s a child,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.892
He doesn’t understand what is sex is. He’s abodh. He’s innocent.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.892
He doesn’t know that sex is something. You see, He has no consciousness of it.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.892
Like a child when He sees sex, for Him it is just like seeing flowers so nothing… he,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.892
he doesn’t understand it. After a certain age only people start understanding it.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.892
So those people who also run away from sex are equally the same because

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.892
there’s nothing to run away and there’s nothing to run to.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.892
It has to be understood at this point that sex has to be a very sacred

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.892
and a secret thing between two personalities that is husband and wife

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.892
who should be really married, collectively.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.892
A marriage which is done secretly somewhere and marriage secretly done somewhere

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.892
is always brings problems. So marriage must be done in a open way

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.892
and should be sanctioned collectively.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.892
Marriage is not an institution came to human beings from somewhere outside,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.892
but it has come to them from within.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.892
God Himself has brought this institution within them and it is to be respected in full way.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.892
And family life is the basis, absolutely the basis of human beings.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.892
Every human being must have a nest to grow when they are children.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.892
We are playing havoc with this principle of family life everywhere

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.892
and we are really out to ruin our children through abandoning the norms

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.892
that are required for a human life. I mean, we have taken up everything into our hands, you see,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.892
as if we can do whatever we feel.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.892
Perhaps by that we do not realise how we are giving no fair chance to our children to grow

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.892
in a proper, secure place. So family life is a very important thing

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.892
and must be dealt with in a way, the way you do a Puja, you do a worship.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.892
The home is a temple where you must have all the holy things, to give children the holiness,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.892
the innocence that is required for them to continue.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.892
Here if you find now the children are so precocious,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.892
sometimes you are shocked the way they are precocious because

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.892
the parents talk all these things in their presence and they say, “What’s wrong?”

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.892
Like you are teaching children about sex. What is there to teach? I really can’t understand.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.892
What is there to teach? Every dog, every, I mean all these birds, everybody,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.892
they know what sex is. Oh, no, human beings need a teaching out of it.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.892
I mean, Indians who are supposed to be most uneducated people,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.892
they are doing much better than all of you are doing here.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.892
It beats me to understand how you people start thinking about teaching everything, even sex.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.892
You see, it is of course to be guided properly through family channels

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.892
but not to be talked so openly, you know. In the beginning it was very difficult for Me even

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.892
to open My mouth. But when I saw the whole thing is so filled with it,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.892
let Me talk about it. Because it is not to be talked, it is not to be mentioned,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.892
it’s a very sacred thing between husband and wife and to be kept as sacred.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.892
But if you excite it too much, from the childhood if you give ideas and all that,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.892
you see unnaturally people are brought up in that way into a very unnatural atmosphere

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.892
and you become nothing but a sex point.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.892
The amount of, you see, importance is given to sex life, you see,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.892
as if, as if they are impotent.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.892
I mean, it is something like that. It amounts to that, the way people are, it’s such a natural thing.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.892
It’s such a spontaneous thing. It’s available to everyone.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.892
What is there for people to think so much about it and plan about it,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.892
talk about it and make the whole thing so vulgar?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.892
There are certain rules and regulations that are to be followed. I mean,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.892
you have to be very, very chaste about it and there’s a certain protocol

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.892
and certain beauty of making it a secret. The more I find now here people,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.892
I’m just talking about the West because we are concerned with Western problems.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.892
Indians have another type which I will tell you later.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.892
They have another horrible types of problems but this is another type we have.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.892
Like a, like we find two people going up the escalator, they must kiss, you see.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.892
They shouldn’t miss one point even. Every step they must go on kissing.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.892
All right. And where are you going? To the divorce court, that’s what it is. You know, it’s so absurd.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.892
There is no deep understanding of the marriage institution.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.892
We cannot exist without marriage institution.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.892
Marriage institution is a gift of God to human beings and not to animals.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.892
We are not going to become again animals. They study the sexual behavior of, say, of fishes.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.892
I mean, are you going to become fishes now? Are we to learn from pigs?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.892
I mean, have we gone that low that we have to go down up to fishes’ level

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.892
and find out how to behave? I mean, it’s absurd.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.892
So this is this centre which is very important and it’s very sacred,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.892
but the other side I told you that is to running away from sex.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.892
On this point I would like to speak because perhaps I have not spoken so much as that.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.892
This is another craze that people have, is to suppress the sex, is to have nunneries,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.892
to have places like where the fathers are living in a very unnatural manner,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.892
create situations where there is no husband-wife relation existing.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.892
I would say Navy has this problem, too. And thank God now Navy has decided to have women

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.892
on board and the wives on board, you see. And actually it has working wonders

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.892
because they are very good husbands, people have found out,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.892
and it gives them some chance to exist normally. I mean, imagine that every port you get,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.892
you get some new girl and end to a complication, fighting with another.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.892
All sorts of problems come up. This multi, multi-women business is going to make you mad.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.892
I mean, to live with one woman itself it’s sufficient.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.892
But to have many women is much more dangerous. So the another thing starts.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.892
See, human beings are like that. If they cannot they’ll go one side, complete indulgences.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.892
They’ll have ten women, get hit, beaten up, finished by that, absolutely broken up,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.892
becoming insolvent. Ultimately they are left like that. Then they become sadhus.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.892
To the other end they will go. They become the sadhus and the sadhus start, you see, then,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.892
“Give up sex. Have nothing to do. Don’t see a woman.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.892
Just you can’t bear her.” You see, this is madness.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.892
Why go from one extreme to another extreme?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.892
Why not see it in a poised and a proper manner that marriage is important,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.892
husband-wife is an important thing. But that’s not the end of life there also.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.892
But still running away from it is something one cannot explain.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.892
Otherwise why God has made you women and men? One should understand about it.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.892
And secondly, those who run away like that, I mean if the women run away, God save this world,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.892
but if men run away what do they get? You see, they run away from it to another, another style.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.892
And what happens with that? You just have a look here.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.892
This is the chakra of the Devi which [UNCLEAR] to run away from.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.892
Now there is no way. You cannot go to this one because it is a… this is the one which is [UNCLEAR].

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:21.892
Thus your attention is just from there you go. There is no attention at all.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:37.892
No attention there [UNCLEAR]. [UNCLEAR] convert your fat into a proper fat

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.892
which can be consumed by brain. So as soon as you do that you start thinking about sex.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.892
That is what it is. People are not spontaneous but they are thinking.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.892
They’ll plan out about it. Everything is planned out and then what happens you start thinking about it

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.892
but you don’t have any sex. So the people who say, “We are nuns, we are nuns,”

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.892
they are thinking about it all the time. But they do not have the actual thing which should be done.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.892
It would be something like eating food with your nose, try to push your food through your nose.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:29:50.892
You see that there is no thinking needed for this and you start thinking about it.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:27:20.892
So they start thinking. How can they get rid of it? You just tell Me.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.892
There’s no sublimation, so-called sublimation and all that nonsense.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.892
If there is no chance of sublimation only the attention will move.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.892
How will you sublimate this part when there is a barrier here

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.892
and this one is as the special one sitting there, with a big rod in his hand?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.892
We call it as the parasha. How do you cross that point? You cannot just cross it.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.892
So what you do? You remove your attention from there and predict.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.892
Now this is the one which we call as the, also called as the sun line.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.892
It’s the sun line, called as sun line. So you move towards the sun.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.892
That’s why you people are such worshippers of sun.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.892
Now, then burn your body. You see, you will not have sex but burn your body

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.892
and make yourself look what you call that brown colour

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.892
and do all kind of nonsensical things to your body. Be unkind to it.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.892
Try to do your level best to ruin it. That’s what you do. And then this sun line starts acting.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.892
Now, sun line takes you away from the left side.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.892
You see that if too much activity starts here it’s

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.892
because your whole attention goes on this side and it is…[UNCLEAR].

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.892
That’s why you become extremely dry. I mean, such a person, I would say Hitler,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.892
Hitler was nothing but this. Hitler had no feelings left in him at all.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.892
There was no emotional thing left in him. He was drained out.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.892
And all these yogis also of this type have this. Like we had a guru in our, you see,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.892
in Durvasa. I mean, if he’d looked at somebody he would burn off. Just imagine.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.892
Such horrible ones, what are they going to do for the emancipation of human beings?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.892
What are they going to do for the Kalyana, for the betterment of human beings

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.892
who haven’t got a grain of love within them? All your idea of love is drained out.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.892
Then you must have heard about these gurus, that the way they are.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.892
Most of them I’ve seen, even the realised ones, needs lot of love within them.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.892
I’ve seen so many realised ones also but they believe in beating the people.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.892
You know, anybody comes to them, first of all they’ll put a big chimta on them, hit them, cut.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.892
“Oh, you are not good.” They, they test your head by hitting.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.892
And you know, sometimes tears would roll down My eyes seeing all that cruelty.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.892
I said, “How can you do this to them?”

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.892
They said, “You don’t know these human beings. They deserve it.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.892
We were like that. Now we are better.” I said, “What are you better? You are hitting the same way.”

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.892
But they are realised people. Can you imagine?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.892
Even without knowing much about love they get Realisation and then they start saying,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.892
“Now, go into absolute vairanth.” Take the case of our Buddha.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.892
Now Buddha was one of the very great incarnations in the sense that He was the son,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.892
one of the sons of Rama who incarnated on this earth,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.892
Buddha, to occupy the highest life on this earth.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.892
So He had to take sanyasa because without that He could not show that.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:46.892
But there was no need for anybody else to take sanyasa. But in His case mistakes,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.892
I mean, why there were some mistakes about things,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.892
because when He tried all these tricks of sanyasa, going here

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.892
and there He never realised that this is all not needed.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.892
He was so tired and fagged out, that suddenly, spontaneous,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.892
the Primordial Mother Herself gave Him the realisation because He was so tired.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.892
Now supposing this is Caxton Hall. To come here you go to, say, Reading,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.892
then you go to in the north to Leeds, then you go this side and then you go to Brighton

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.892
and come back here. And you tell everybody,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.892
“If you have to go to Caxton Hall you better do all that.”

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.892
It is just like that. It is just like that, very misleading.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.892
Because when He found it out, as you have found out too,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:51.892
you do not realise how you have found it. You do not know how you have done it.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.892
If I do not tell you that it is God who has done it, how are you going to believe it?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.892
You will think, “I’ve done Self-realisation, all right. I am a self-realised person.”

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.892
Self is most important. That’s why He believed this Anishvarvad means atheism. He said,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.892
“There is no God. Only thing, the Self is to be achieved.” Naturally,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.892
because there was nobody to tell Him that you have achieved

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.892
through the grace of the Primordial Mother.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.892
So He was to be born again as one of the sons of Fatimabai

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.892
who was the daughter of Mohammed Sahib.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.892
Then again He was to be born as Markandeya and again as Shankaracharya,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.892
just to neutralise what He has been preaching.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.892
So you will see that in the sixth century Shankaracharya is the one who put end to Buddhism,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.892
the nonsense of Buddhism in India.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.892
Because apart from what Buddha’s understanding of the whole thing is His disciples

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.892
made it so perverse that somebody had to come down to tell

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.892
that marriage system has to be re-established.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.892
And this is how this right side was controlled through various incarnations coming down.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.892
But now we come to the centre point, is the Vishnu Tattwa, as I told you,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.892
the principle of sustenance within us. By this sustenance force only we have within us our dharma,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.892
means we are human beings. Human beings have to have some sustenance.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.892
Otherwise he would have two horns. He would have a tail hanging around.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.892
But he does not. He doesn’t have. Why human beings do not have horns?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.892
Why do not they have tails? I mean, they behave sometimes like that but still they don’t develop.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.892
You see, in churches in children it is very common to tell them that

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.892
“If you behave like this you will start developing a tail.” Immediately they’ll start looking.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.892
“Have we already developed?” Then you have to tell them, “Not yet.”

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.892
“But then be careful about us, you see. Better tell us. Otherwise we’ll develop it.”

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.892
So this is how we are, that we are human beings.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.892
If we were not human beings our noses would have been like that or could have been like that.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.892
But we are human beings. That’s why we have a particular type of a face.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.892
We have a particular type of eyes. You have seen in the animal kingdom how the eyes are placed.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.892
Like fishes, how their eyes are placed according to their environment,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.892
according to their evolution. Now why should we try to be fishes? Have you got eyes like fishes?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.892
We are human beings. We have to be human beings.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.892
And the human beings have got as in the four varanas are described,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.892
they have to move in a evolutionary process with their understanding.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.892
This is the biggest difference between a human being and animal.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.892
So far from animal to this stage you do not know how you came up.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.892
You never felt your evolution. You never knew that what, how you evolved into it.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.892
But only when you have become a human being you can feel it.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.892
That’s why your evolution had to be in such a manner that you can feel it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.892
And you have also got a special faculty of deciding for yourself,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.892
of freedom by which you develop yourself in such a manner that you can feel it.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.892
The fishes never felt it. The amoeba never felt it.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.892
It’s only you who can feel your evolution because you are at the topmost position of evolution

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:43.892
and if it has to move forward it has to be in your own awareness with all respect to your freedom.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.892
So freedom was given to human being, not only that

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.892
but also that they are going to see their own evolution within themselves.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.892
They are going to feel it. You’ll feel so different as soon as you are evolved,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.892
because you are the highest. Human beings, if they had ever evaluated themselves,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.892
even if they had asked this question to themselves,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.892
“Why did I became human being from that insignificant amoeba?” then they would have realised,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.892
evaluated their value. But when they evaluate themselves,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.892
when they try to understand themselves they become egoistical. This is the problem.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.892
And that also comes from the same sun line. You see the ego – that’s the yellow,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.892
that balloon of ego – when it covers the whole being a person just, you see,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.892
he talks as if he is possessed. He can never understand what he is talking about

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:58.892
and what he is meaning when he says, “I, I, I, I, I,” because you are not a separate entity.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.892
You are a part and parcel of the whole. And when you start saying,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.892
“I, I,” you actually secede yourself. You cut yourself short of your connections with the whole.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.892
With this understanding if you see, here the centre chakra which is the,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.892
what we call the Nabhi chakra.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.892
Here the sustenance was established and through its establishment,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.892
the seat for your evolution was created. So we evolve through our sustenance,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:48.892
through our evolutionary process by which we have a complete incarnation of this principle

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.892
of Vishnu, is Krishna who is placed there. So from this Vishnu Tattwa

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.892
when you go around the Bhavasagara till that point you are still trying to come out of it

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:13.892
and at this point you come out and here is [UNCLEAR] Shri Rama.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:23.892
Normally this place is occupied by the deity of Mahakali? or you can call..[UNCLEAR].

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.892
Which comes from here, this power, normally, and then She incarnates in this Bhavasagara

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.892
where the seekers are trying to find God.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.892
Because every time the seekers tried to find God there were evil forces

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.892
which tried to put it down. So She had to incarnate.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.892
They say She incarnated only one thousand times

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.892
but I think She has incarnated many more times. But whatever it is,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.892
She incarnated one thousand times and She protected these, Her bhaktas or Her,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.892
what you call, Her devotees to be saved from the satanic forces.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:17.892
Now this one is the incarnation of Vaikadesha but before that all those incarnations

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.892
that came are up to this point. Now this one, one must understand is,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.892
these devya were actually normal human beings. They could not come up.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.892
Because Rama was not regarded as an incarnation.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.892
He was seen as absolutely a human being who was still on this sun line,

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.892
the rajasa, the absolutely human being. This is the rajasa.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.892
That is the tamasa, on the left hand side. This is the rajasa.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.892
And the centre one is the satwa. That’s why He was placed there.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.892
Now this Goddess is the power which exists in your heart chakra in the centre.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.892
Now when the child is small, you must know that all the antibodies develop in the sternum,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.892
in the sternum. And these antibodies are actually the fighters

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.892
who fight evil or any harm to the body.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.892
These bodies, what you call these antibodies, spread to the whole being

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.892
and after, say, twelve years or so they start acting automatically or, you can say,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.892
even spontaneously. Sometimes they are on their own, because they are trained in this area,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:49.892
in the sternum area, how to fight the disease, how to fight the outward invasions.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.892
Even the mental trouble which comes to you comes through some sort of a satanic force

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.892
which can be in a very, in the form of a small lacuna and then they attack there.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.892
And that’s how they work out. So this is the,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:12.892
in the sternum here is placed the power of the Durga or you can call the Mother,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.892
the Mother of this earth, Jagadamba. She’s the One who is the Mother of this earth.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.892
And She, Her power comes from the back here,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.892
where you have a centre called as the Hridaya (Heart) chakra

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.892
but we can say that it looks after the cardiac plexus in the human being.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.892
So those people who have got say asthma are suffering from the same.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.892
Those women who have got, say, breast cancer have suffering from the same,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.892
means the sense of insecurity. If you have sense of insecurity then these,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.892
these lungs start breathing fast. You have seen suddenly you,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.892
if you meet with fear you get that breathing very fast in you.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:08.892
And this breathing is denoting or is pointing out to some sort of a fear that is working within you.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:18.892
It could be due to previous conditionings or could be immediate, but this centre starts working,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.892
breathing starts moving at a very high speed and that is the sign of this centre

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.892
that it starts emitting power of protection when if you start breathing heavily.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.892
But it is automatically done.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.892
And the women who suffer from sense of insecurity get breast cancer

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.892
and that also this is the centre. While I will be talking to you about various diseases

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.892
how we can cure through Sahaja Yoga then I’ll tell you more about it.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.892
Now the highest point of the sustenance is here, just here.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.892
When man raised his head upward, this is the point where Shri Krishna, the,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:13.892
the highest goal of human evolution reached its completion poornatha. At that time we,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.892
we should say that when we raised our heads up He established Himself in our Vishuddhi chakra.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.892
And He is the one who is this Primordial Being.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.892
He is the One who grows into that Primordial Being.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.892
About Shri Krishna also I will tell you, I think, later on because you can understand

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.892
He has sixteen petals. He has the largest number of petals

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.892
which in physical way look after your ear, nose, throat, these mastoid muscles and teeth

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:59.892
and all, all this portion. Apart from that if you notice it that this ego and superego,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.892
you see, actually they do not rise that high up.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.892
They rise from here it starts, from this centre only give the complete start.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.892
Complete start from this centre… [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:21.892
but they cross at this centre which we call as the Agnya chakra.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:35.892
Now pumping of the ego and superego comes like the, we can say, the fumes from a factory.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.892
Like when you are overactive on the right hand side you develop your ego as a by-product.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.892
If somebody says, “I have no ego,” well, it’s wrong, not possible.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.892
There is all the time ego within you.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.892
Like people said, “Krishna has said that ‘Oh, you, you just surrender everything to Me,’

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.892
and that’s how I have surrendered myself to Him.” It’s wrong.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.892
You cannot do it, because you have got ego. You have to cross beyond.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.892
Unless and until you cross behind – beyond, you cannot get over your ego.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.892
So these ego and superego, if you see, they cross. So the superego is, say, from here to here.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.892
The ego is from here to here.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.892
But as the human beings started growing the superego which is the conditioning in us,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.892
the conditioning as seen by the psychologists, they call it the psyche part

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.892
and they never realised that there is also ego.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.892
If you remove the conditionings completely from human beings, do whatever you please,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.892
you become egoistical. They never realised this subtle point

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.892
and they allowed you to do whatever you liked, and they allowed you to, sort of fully assert yourself.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.892
Then they did never realise that on the other side is also this ego developing within you.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.892
And that’s why we have got now countries we can say which are ego-oriented.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.892
Others are superego-oriented.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:18.892
But now the stage is such that nothing much to choose, it’s such a confusion and a muddle.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.892
they tried to push the superego down like that which went to such a limit that it started hurting people.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.892
They couldn’t bear it so they came up with their superego.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.892
And this is the beginning of people talking about, “I feel very guilty,” “I’m very sorry,”

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.892
“We must have some sympathy for others,”

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.892
“We must look after the people who are suffering,” and all that kind of a thing.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:53.892
Then they take to also drugs. Also you can see that all this left side is more sort of meant for people

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.892
who take drugs and who go into lethargy and more sitting down and dreaming for poets, all sorts of things.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.892
[Missing part]

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.892
went to India and invaded India and now I am responsible for that.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:17.892
You start feeling guilty for somebody who’s died and is born somewhere in Africa or maybe born in Timbuktu.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.892
You see maybe that you are the one who was a saint in India

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.892
and who has been looked after the Mother and today you are here crying for nothing at all.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.892
So this is the situation of today’s muddled-up world and the superego,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.892
or the others who were supposed to be superego, non-aggressive people,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.892
say like Indian people, now are, they are developing, they are getting sophisticated, you see.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.892
And they think that to wear a suit is a very big thing.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.892
If you wear a suit they start speaking some other language.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.892
And to them you see to be posh, to be very impressive and all that is very important.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.892
Whether they have food or not doesn’t matter but must dress up well to impress people,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.892
you see, and that’s why I tell always my disciples that when you go to India don’t go like hippies.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.892
Better go like very well-dressed government servants. And you can only impress them only….

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.892
And there, so we are developing now in India and we are becoming very materialistic, extremely materialistic.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.892
I mean not that you people here in the West have left your materialism to that extent

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.892
but I mean here every Dick, Tom and Harry is not a materialistic person.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.892
Specially the people who are of a higher style, they are not that materialistic.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.892
But like, your, you see, the labor class here you can say as they are very particular now…

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.892
Today was the budget day, last day

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.892
so all the shops were on and everybody was buying even the jewellery?, then everything,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.892
in the shops, you see. But the Indians would be the most, you see,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.892
because they must see what is happening here. As soon as… I wouldn’t say Indians,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.892
all the Asians I would put like that, not only Indians,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.892
because you see when they come to England they see in the shops, you see.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.892
They make the list of saris they have to take home.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.892
They make the list of things they have to take home.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.892
They are equally the same as you have been long time back.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.892
Like you’ll be amazed that once upon a time plastic was a big, big craze for you people here

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.892
and nylon was also once upon a time. Now we are trying to wear nylons for you.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.892
It’s a good exchange, I think, but this is what we are in the muddle, either in the superego or ego.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.892
We cannot just fix the person. He could be one moment in the superego, one moment in the ego.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.892
He’ll be just going from one side to another.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:49.892
The thing that really gives you the balance is the sustenance, is the sustenance, dharma.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:03.892
If you do not have that then you could go, shoot off like a pendulum from this side to that.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.892
So I mean if you try to make the dharma a fanatic idea like none of these incarnations,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.892
like Mohamed Sahib who was an incarnation of the Primordial Master

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.892
and all others like Him – Moses, Abraham – anyone of Them who came on this earth,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.892
ever thought of fanaticism. Never they realised that when they told,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.892
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that,” some sort of people will take up upon themselves that,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.892
“We are the chosen ones. We are the great.” I mean, this they could have never understood

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.892
and whenever they found it was happening again they took birth.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.892
Again they took birth to tell people this is not dharma.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.892
To form any kind of a cult or an organisation and religion is against God. It’s blasphemous.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.892
How can you organise God? You cannot.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.892
Those who have done it always have brought absolute fall of human beings. You see,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.892
that’s why you cannot control. Like the other day I was saying

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.892
that our Pope has good intentions of going to Poland.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.892
But in a way I like Polish Catholicism more than the Irish one.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.892
If this is the freedom what Catholicism is, better not have it.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.892
You see, if this is what you are going to achieve through your Catholicism, better not have it.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.892
In Poland, say, for example, people do not do philanthropic work, you see,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.892
like helping the poor. Is that the work of Christ? I asked somebody, I said,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.892
“How did you come to this conclusion that Christ wanted you to help the poor?”

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.892
They said, “Because You know once He was to be,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.892
He was to be anointed with some very expensive oil,” and I think Judah said that

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.892
‘How can you spend such a lot of money on Him, on His body?

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.892
Let us sell it and give it to the poor.'”

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.892
So He said – now, see, listen to this one carefully – He said that, “Poor are forever,”

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.892
means it’s a permanent headache, you see, “but I am for a short time.”

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.892
That means spiritual life is the thing. Now, in the same way He said that

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.892
“No rich man can enter into the kingdom of God.”

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.892
Both are just the same. Poor are just the same as the rich. Do you find any difference in them?

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:34.892
I do not. One hankers after money; another one gets spoilt by it.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.892
and one has, that’s why he is no good. If the rich had little less money it would be better for them.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.892
And if the poor had little more it would be better.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.892
So our Sahaja Yoga works for the people of the middle, middle things.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.892
Now immediately you will say, “Then what about the poor of the world?”

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.892
Immediately the attention will go there. “Mother, what do you think?”

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.892
Now you don’t worry about that part.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.892
There is God who has created them and He is going to look after them. Are you an economist?

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.892
Then you are, you have done all bad things.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.892
Because of faulty planning, because of selfish nature, because of conservatism,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.892
because of thinking that you are the person who should enjoy all your wealth,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.892
you have created these disparities. Human beings have created, not God,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.892
and when you have to achieve God you don’t have to think all these problems that human beings have created.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.892
Like somebody came and told Me, “What about Vietnam?” I said,

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.892
“Are you a governor appointed there?” You see, he had a problem of his own.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.892
He was coming from an asylum and he asked Me, gets up very seriously, said,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.892
“What about Vietnam?” Now tell Me, this fellow is really half mad.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.892
He’s gone to that asylum from where he has come, and why is he worried about this Vietnam?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.892
Now, what does that show? How is he going to help Vietnam?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.892
This is how the attention of human beings moves. I mean,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.892
what you have to do is to achieve that within yourself, your own powers.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:09.892
Everyone has to achieve that power. Even if you are poor you can achieve it. What is poverty?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.892
It’s just mental idea, “It is poverty.” You see, for people I’ve seen,

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.892
horrible people who are supposed to be rich just like beggars, I tell you, absolutely beggars.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.892
Even if they could get out of you one torn handkerchief, oh, they will be very happy.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.892
Horrible people, I don’t know, what riches, it has not gone even skin deep.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:42.892
Even I would tell you that if you put so many pounds just posted on a donkey

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.892
he would look better than these people are. I mean, it has not touched them at all, you see.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.892
And the way they talk you know how the people are, how licentious they are,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.892
how permissive they are, how careless they are about their children,

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:02.892
how they are irresponsible, how they are killing others just to save their reputation.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.892
I mean, there’s nothing that they cannot do.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.892
Same with poorer people; they are just the same. You see,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.892
if you go and talk to them, now our Maria had this, this thing, they said,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.892
“We, we want this man to be cured by Mataji but we are not going to believe in God.”

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.892
Now what can you say to that? Only you can say to take two running jumps and go to hell.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.892
That’s what it is meant for such horrible people.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.892
They want to take advantage of God’s power and then, “We don’t believe in God.”

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.892
See, this is poverty. And the poorer they are the worse they are in their arrogance,

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.892
in their assertions, in their asking. They don’t want to do any work.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.892
They want to have this. They want to have that.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:42.892
All these things will be only explained once they achieve God. Otherwise they will not move.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:56:02.892
They all must rise. I mean, that the way the churches have now become nothing but union offices,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.892
labor union offices. See, poor people go there and confess to the priest. Now, it’s madness.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.892
He cannot do anything to them. What is he after all?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.892
He himself is an ordinary human being, ordained. Which by whom?

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.892
God has ordained you? Or who has ordained you?

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:29.892
All such organisations will only create headaches and people who have got nothing

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.892
but some sort of an idea that they are something great. You see, you ask anyone,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.892
“What are you?” “I’m a Catholic.” What does that mean? “I’m a,” what you call that,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.892
“Church of England.” In India specially, the Indian Christians,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:51.892
if somebody is from Church of England he will not look at the person from Church of Scotland.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.892
You should see Indians, you see when they are Christians you must see the way they are.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.892
“Oh, we, we don’t talk to them.” I said, “Why?”

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.892
“Because they are from the Church of Scotland, you know,”

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.892
or Presbyterians you see, or Lutherans. So according to them

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.892
they are the highest because Church of England.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.892
Now they must come and see the condition of Church of England to understand. You see,

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:19.892
this is the trouble. It is really, I tell you, like lunatic people. It’s absolutely like lunatic people.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.892
They are brainwashed, completely. And by that they are not going to achieve anything.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.892
We have to achieve the reality. We have to know that we have to achieve it

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.892
and for that we have to stand by reality, face it moment and moment

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.892
and then the enjoyment of reality will be uncovered and will be absolutely manifested within you.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.892
But we have to stand by reality and not go by thinking, “I think, Mataji, You were wrong there.”

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.892
I said, “Where? Where was I wrong?”

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.892
“Because, You know, You told us this,” and that’s why I was wrong.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.892
I said, “How do you know?” “I feel that way.”

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.892
“Now, how can you feel about what I am thinking or what I am saying?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.892
You have to then understand rationally. But when I say rationally, do you understand?”

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.892
“Rationally I understand but I don’t feel that way.”

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:09.892
Now, what is this feel? See, a thing which is told to you rationally must be understood rationally.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.892
And whatever is to be felt is to be felt through heart.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.892
But they will feel a rational thing and they will think about the love. It is something absurd.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.892
That’s why it is crazy. The attitude itself is crazy.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.892
So open out yourself because there is an invitation.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.892
There is a great invitation for you to enter into that kingdom of God which is promised to you.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.892
You must know that God has created this earth. He has created you.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.892
He is not going to allow His creation to be destroyed, will He? What are you worried about?

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.892
He is the One who is going to take you across.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.892
He is the One who is going to tell you each and everything that He has,

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.892
to possess all the beauties, all the blessings that He has,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.892
to enjoy them. He is going to do everything for you.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.892
But when the boat is crossing, keep quiet. Don’t run here and there.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.892
All the time the children are running from here and there. You go on catching them.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.892
“Come along. Come along.” Sometimes even they get drowned. Just keep quiet.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.892
Everybody is going to get it, everybody is going to be taken into it and everybody is going to enjoy it.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.892
For today I think it was quite a lecture though I have told you

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.892
that Christ is on this chakra has come and that is the last chakra of Sahasrara

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:40.892
which opened on the fifth of May in India in 1970

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:48.892
and since then the new awareness has started becoming, dawning into people.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.892
The vibrations have started flowing. And it’s a very great thing that you are born at this time

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.892
and you are the people, the foundations.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.892
You are the people who are going to receive it completely.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.892
I don’t know about the future, what is going to happen to the future and all that

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.892
but I am sure it is going to work out. And in this London,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.892
London which I have always said it’s the heart of the universe, we are going to do it

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.892
with great understanding of the problems of the whole world.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.892
If heart is all right everything will be all right because through it everything is going to circulate,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.892
and going to improve, and going to nurture, and going to develop this beautiful universe

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.892
that God has created for you. But first thing you must know is to give up all your misidentifications.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:39.892
And do not go on hankering onto them and again getting identifying yourself with them

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.892
but keep a complete alert attention on your progress in Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.892
I’m sure it is going to work out. May God bless you all! Thank you.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:13.892
So, any questions?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.892
Now, ask questions which are related to this lecture.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.892
Because if you ask them out of the blue questions, you see

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.892
not out of the blue questions, see what is there, now I need another lecture.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.892
You see, I cannot just say what is God is and things like that.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.892
So you please don’t ask such questions.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.892
Ask something relating to this lecture that would help you and everybody.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.892
And ask questions which are constructive.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.892
Question: [Inaudible] 5th of May.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:15.892
Shri Mataji: That happened… That is the day when the en-masse Realisation was established…

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.892
Why? Question: Where?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.892
Shri Mataji: Where? In India.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.892
Question: [Inaudible]

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:39.892
Shri Mataji: It happened in My brain. And it happened on a sea shore in India when I saw it….

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:49.892
And of course I will tell you some time how beautifully it worked out, and how beautiful it was.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:08.892
Question: [Inaudible]

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.892
Shri Mataji: One of the names it is in the one book I have given you, is that Nirvicharita,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:29.892
Now you think of that thought. You see,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.892
now you cannot. Can you?  Try.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.892
No, no. That is the fact. One must accept. You have crossed the Agnya.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.892
You see, now you cannot. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. It’s very good.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.892
Now you can see the thoughts also. Are you returned now? Are you feeling better Hester?

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.892
Good. This is very beautiful.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.892
Enjoy it. Forget it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:27.892
Forget about that. We are going to meet again and again and you’ll have ample time.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.892
But the more you will be meeting the more you’ll become thoughtless,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.892
the more you’ll be enjoying the silence within you,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.892
more you will be going deep into your own silence, really enjoying it.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.892
Actually after Realisation you don’t even feel bored. You’ll be surprised.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.892
You’ll be sitting for hours together without getting bored, absolutely without getting bored.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.892
And that’s how people give up, you see, all these habits of say, smoking and all those

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.892
because when you are bored you don’t know what to do so you take to these habits.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.892
That’s what you get it. You are not to be forced, you are not to be told

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.892
but once you start enjoying yourself you just don’t do it. [Hindi]

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:20.892
Are you better now? Not yet? [Hindi] He’s a born-realised, still.
