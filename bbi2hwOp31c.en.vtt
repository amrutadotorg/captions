3
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.120
Please write it now his name

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.379
on a piece of it.

5
00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149
Good,

9
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.500
slow and steady means the rain.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000
Mm.

11
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.159

Excellent,

16
00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.790

17
00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:48.709
Oh

18
00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.700
Who is it?

19
00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:11.349
God's hands have become very soft.

20
00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:20.470
that they be going up.

21
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.489
Good that we have.

22
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.319
Yeah.

23
00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:40.069
Thank you.

24
00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:47.099
No,

25
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.819
no,

26
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.330
I think I had.

27
00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.739
Uh-huh.

28
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.319
I know.

29
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910
Mhm.

30
00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:06.349
This one?

31
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.440
Yeah.

32
00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.669
I

33
00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.679
Could

34
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.619
Uh,

35
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:19.990
they might call you.

36
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.649
So

37
00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:22.860
there's something else.

38
00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.889
No

39
00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:27.669
In some

40
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.100
And

41
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.570
All right,

42
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.809
it doesn't spoil you.

43
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.960
OK.

44
00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:47.899
Oh

45
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.449
Well

46
00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.570
Hold on.

47
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.509
Do

48
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.160
You're very much cleared out

49
00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.669
all right.

50
00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.949
But uh

51
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.800
in that thing,

52
00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.479
did I say something about TM?

53
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.169
In that lecture when

54
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.449
uh this fellow was there,

55
00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:33.860
did I say something about you?

56
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.750
I can.

57
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.740
After?

58
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.529
He left

59
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.389
because you asked me some questions about it or something.

60
00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.860
Another car

61
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.899
he had gone by then,

62
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.490
huh.

63
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.619
What did you say?

64
00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.929
Is it?

65
00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:03.309
If he goes to him,

66
00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:05.160
then what did he say?

67
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.380
So it went on that but uh.

68
00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:11.899
On the defensive

69
00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.929
He was on the defensive.

70
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.640
I said.

71
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.119
There was a woman next to him.

72
00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:23.250
Yeah.

73
00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.609
No,

74
00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:31.070
no,

75
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.420
no,

76
00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.850
no.

77
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.510
So what,

78
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.540
what did she say?

79
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:41.480
Um,

80
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.209
and she,

81
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.890
she was kind of fifty-fifty at that stage

82
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.679
because she could feel cool and everything,

83
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.130
but she was a bit wondering.

84
00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:50.470
But uh

85
00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.269
I,

86
00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:52.899
I didn't realise at the time,

87
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.670
but I cotton on that he wasn't gonna.

88
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.630
You know,

89
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.329
he was just

90
00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:58.750
looking more than coming to get realisation and so.

91
00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:01.170
was

92
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.049
that

93
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.730
But to me it didn't,

94
00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:05.950
he didn't seem very uh.

95
00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:09.839
It seems like you know did nothing and all that.

96
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.260
Work

97
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.829
Now what I'm saying.

98
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.160
That uh he was flickering his eyes

99
00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:21.329
when you told him

100
00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:28.540
but the has come up.

101
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.589
What is it

102
00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.950
But.

103
00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.989
Yeah

104
00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.429
What

105
00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:43.279
It's some like.

106
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.390
I'll get you

107
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.679
That you

108
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.399
OK.

109
00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:01.820
I

110
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.320
You ready to like,

111
00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.920
huh?

112
00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:10.540
He just is left for the channel

113
00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.350
is because of this and that is it.

114
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.359
I

115
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.760
Mhm.

116
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:21.070
OK.

117
00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.980
Mhm

118
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.299
Mhm

119
00:06:30.549 --> 00:06:30.559
Mhm.

120
00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.940
Mhm

121
00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:37.790
the

122
00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.380
Mm

123
00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:39.579
there you go.

124
00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.779
I'm

125
00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:49.540
You

126
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.559
I think.

127
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.429
Mhm

128
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.690
So I don't know what

129
00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:14.010
You

130
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.019
Mhm

131
00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:18.970
What about the husband?

132
00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:20.320
For like

133
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.359
I

134
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.670
and then we like to see it with

135
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:28.589
with the.

136
00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:38.070
Yes.

137
00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:42.589
It's really you were willing to.

138
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:45.459
but you know she told me,

139
00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:52.950
she told me that mother,

140
00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:53.929
if you come,

141
00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:55.420
uh,

142
00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:57.510
you see these people will change their idea.

143
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.720
problem on the um.

144
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:08.109
is supposedly in the shank.

145
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:16.829
tradition.

146
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.529
And we are told that it is a change.

147
00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.399
Do you not read Shankara?

148
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:27.290
I mean,

149
00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:27.570
but it's very

150
00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:29.690
abstract way of saying things.

151
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.959
The relatively absolute,

152
00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:32.549
that's it.

153
00:08:35.508 --> 00:08:39.379
These are such fun bombastic things the way they talk 10.

154
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.010
So they say this can't be wrong,

155
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.309
there's been a secret thing.

156
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.359
Have you got any certificate from his guru even?

157
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.159
I

158
00:09:00.119 --> 00:09:02.919
don't think his guru ever said that he's my disciple.

159
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.059
I'm sure of it.

160
00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.880
Is there any certificate from his guru?

161
00:09:07.869 --> 00:09:09.380
How does he say he was his guru?

162
00:09:09.429 --> 00:09:10.190
He was Shankara.

163
00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:15.969
You either believe or disbelieve.

164
00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.219
You either believe or you're a disbeliever.

165
00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:22.750
Another thing I can tell you.

166
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.719
That

167
00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:26.830
if he thought he was a directly,

168
00:09:26.989 --> 00:09:28.510
he should have been appointed Shankaraja.

169
00:09:33.859 --> 00:09:34.830
Oh my God.

170
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.609
Imagine what is

171
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.020
What is Shankarachary?

172
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.929
What is all this?

173
00:09:44.869 --> 00:09:45.809
But you don't read Shavi Shankar.

174
00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:45.929
He doesn't give you books to read about.

175
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:46.099
It's like a lot of it's like a lot of um.

176
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:02.270
You're not

177
00:10:08.989 --> 00:10:09.080
encouraged to read outside.

178
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.349
You're not encouraged to explore outside the confines of the a lot of,

179
00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:09.539
you see,

180
00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:10.909
when you start reading outside it,

181
00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:11.900
you finish up here.

182
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.020
So you,

183
00:10:17.369 --> 00:10:18.619
you only read

184
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:30.289
whatever is in there,

185
00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:30.330
whatever they teach.

186
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.450
You're only encouraged to,

187
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:30.489
as I say,

188
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:30.539
if you read it.

189
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.270
The 1st 6 chapters of Cocoa,

190
00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:35.789
which I read

191
00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:39.320
about a week after I started TM and I haven't read.

192
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.229
with each other.

193
00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:43.940
I all his commentary,

194
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.580
but at the time I thought.

195
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.080
And he makes every single paragraph in the background.

196
00:10:54.669 --> 00:10:55.349
meditation.

197
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.809
Christian Lord be without the threes.

198
00:11:03.049 --> 00:11:04.119
What he's saying is.

199
00:11:05.409 --> 00:11:05.460
Well,

200
00:11:05.719 --> 00:11:06.880
that's true.

201
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.440
He claims that CMU takes him directly to the transcendental field.

202
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.890
All seems to make sense.

203
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:15.729
They feel.

204
00:11:16.419 --> 00:11:17.950
I think that's the basis of it like myself,

205
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.590
and then,

206
00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:22.669
then it falls down to it's a complete liar.

207
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.580
So what do they teach then?

208
00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:27.169
I mean,

209
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.450
they don't allow you to read any other thing.

210
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.530
Then what do they teach you?

211
00:11:33.549 --> 00:11:36.030
The movement is about the.

212
00:11:37.979 --> 00:11:38.809
Let me put it this way,

213
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.780
the movements in two halves.

214
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.340
They're the meditators,

215
00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:43.260
the teachers.

216
00:11:44.309 --> 00:11:46.140
And there are probably 1600 teachers.

217
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:47.429
Well there are about

218
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.940
2 million many days.

219
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.390
Don't be taught to take.

220
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.830
Probably only half actually practise it or even less.

221
00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:57.760
What is the technique?

222
00:11:57.869 --> 00:11:58.000
Still,

223
00:11:58.039 --> 00:11:58.809
I don't understand.

224
00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.929
They give you just a month.

225
00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:02.429
So it's an,

226
00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:05.520
an inner exploration as opposed to an intellectual thing.

227
00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:08.890
It's an inner exploration into the transcendence.

228
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.219
What

229
00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:15.210
Which is the source of,

230
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:15.510
you see,

231
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.429
he describes it as a field of all possibilities that

232
00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:21.210
runs the home of all the laws of nature,

233
00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:21.239
huh,

234
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:21.260
home

235
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.750
of all the laws of nature.

236
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.789
To transcend

237
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.809
source of thought,

238
00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:30.700
the source of creative intelligence.

239
00:12:33.849 --> 00:12:34.679
But if you,

240
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.750
if he's saying Shankar you never believed in thought.

241
00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:40.099
Well,

242
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.109
it's beyond you,

243
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.700
you're meant to take you is beyond the mind is the source of thought.

244
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.919
You know that you're going to be very sore the first.

245
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.799
A little speck of thought.

246
00:12:56.179 --> 00:12:57.840
Blossoms into the

247
00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:05.849
at the gross level.

248
00:13:05.859 --> 00:13:05.929
So you're diving,

249
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.559
you're transcending the um.

250
00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:11.049
Indian philosophic adage of the cf dipped in dye

251
00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:14.049
dried in the sun bleached lifted again,

252
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:14.619
dried

253
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.250
till the colours fast

254
00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:17.590
and very bright,

255
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.090
and that is the experience of transcending.

256
00:13:25.669 --> 00:13:30.520
what they do is this you have this mantra and the whatever it is.

257
00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.919
You keep on saying it in your mind and then after.

258
00:13:36.099 --> 00:13:37.140
And you're going to,

259
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.440
I think you're going to the subconscious field my head always.

260
00:13:45.469 --> 00:13:48.280
I wake up and then I'd sleep and I used to have lots of.

261
00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:51.270
And that's good it's only expressing.

262
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.940
What they used to say was every time I.

263
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.450
Actually really you are all bad people you are.

264
00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.849
How could you listen to such a nonsense as that,

265
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:04.539
see.

266
00:14:05.809 --> 00:14:05.849
Well,

267
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.250
it was the promise of release from the bondage of the relatives.

268
00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:09.140
Of what?

269
00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:12.309
Release from the bondage of the relative existence.

270
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:21.309
The attachment to if you're a seeker you just blah blah to see

271
00:14:21.309 --> 00:14:26.260
because he says that he's taking you out of a bondage of materialism

272
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:26.969
how.

273
00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:29.820
By loosening your grip,

274
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.140
you see,

275
00:14:30.539 --> 00:14:30.780
you see,

276
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.210
his,

277
00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:33.049
his opinion of renunciation

278
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.729
is not tapa.

279
00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:39.130
It's meditation because when you transcend

280
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.780
and reach the thoughtless awareness.

281
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.849
That is your renunciation because you're no longer in touch with your relatives.

282
00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:47.580
But do you really?

283
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.309
I can't remember.

284
00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:54.590
That's it.

285
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.130
And then they would say like,

286
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280
does he say also

287
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.799
that you must have committed since that's why you cannot do it you have to do it more.

288
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.640
Does he say so?

289
00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:04.549
No,

290
00:15:05.049 --> 00:15:05.090
no.

291
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.830
This is a way of short circuiting the car move.

292
00:15:11.109 --> 00:15:12.039
He said so and why is he there?

293
00:15:13.219 --> 00:15:14.659
You should ask him if,

294
00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:16.429
if you have to bear our karma.

295
00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:19.690
It is impossible to ask.

296
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.130
He's in an ivory tower,

297
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:23.340
you know,

298
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:29.169
he's detached from and this in a sense is where the seed of the downfall might occur.

299
00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:30.340
It's too remote.

300
00:15:31.369 --> 00:15:33.020
And their problems aren't answered.

301
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.869
You see what he's done,

302
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.520
he's uh.

303
00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.000
He's divided himself

304
00:15:38.219 --> 00:15:39.489
1600 times

305
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.659
by teaching people.

306
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:42.679
So

307
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.780
the teachers of the.

308
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.820
Holders of the knowledge.

309
00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:47.400
But often,

310
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.599
you know,

311
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.429
they reach problems as with garlic,

312
00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:50.219
for example,

313
00:15:50.729 --> 00:15:51.000
for myself,

314
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:51.239
I mean,

315
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.280
I was suicidal.

316
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.010
A year ago

317
00:15:55.219 --> 00:15:55.770
Um,

318
00:15:57.169 --> 00:15:58.200
Nobody could help you.

319
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.150
There was no rapport among ourselves.

320
00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:04.119
No one,

321
00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:04.780
nobody,

322
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.520
nobody could help.

323
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.780
I mean the teachers.

324
00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:08.210
Couldn't help it.

325
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.210
Your depressions were,

326
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:10.539
you know,

327
00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:11.059
beyond.

328
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:11.789
Oh

329
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.900
So this is the problem but these teachers are paid or?

330
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.039
They they

331
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:24.700
they live.

332
00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:26.719
On a sergeant,

333
00:16:28.609 --> 00:16:29.650
they get a very small amount,

334
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.690
not a living income.

335
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.700
I don't have enough to live on.

336
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.409
So you know the money goes.

337
00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:37.679
You

338
00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:45.020
Set up the see first of all,

339
00:16:45.099 --> 00:16:45.440
they

340
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.489
uh they

341
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:47.729
they never

342
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.409
kept anything open for you,

343
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.530
so they closed it.

344
00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:54.380
By sort of putting an all about it.

345
00:16:55.219 --> 00:16:56.070
Not to ask this,

346
00:16:56.109 --> 00:16:57.030
you are not to do,

347
00:16:57.109 --> 00:16:57.770
you are not to complain.

348
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.400
The first thing they do is to sort of cut you from.

349
00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:04.828
All the other

350
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.479
Because

351
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.420
uh.

352
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.469
They knew that they would be found out.

353
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.348
So they just kept you out

354
00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:16.699
and started talking big,

355
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.000
you see,

356
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.060
which was too heavy for you already.

357
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.310
We thought was going to other

358
00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:24.040
sources we thought that you may not be able to learn.

359
00:17:25.479 --> 00:17:26.098
As I say,

360
00:17:26.318 --> 00:17:26.479
you know,

361
00:17:26.598 --> 00:17:28.229
by not encouragement it today.

362
00:17:29.229 --> 00:17:29.390
You know,

363
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.869
developed the blinker effect and also people fear.

364
00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:33.469
Um,

365
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.530
there's a lot of.

366
00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:35.869
Like

367
00:17:36.449 --> 00:17:38.359
a lot of people want to become teachers,

368
00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:39.290
and it's very expensive.

369
00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:40.489
It costs about 6000 pounds.

370
00:17:41.479 --> 00:17:42.530
Become a TMP

371
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.290
It takes about 9 months.

372
00:17:46.699 --> 00:17:47.510
Um,

373
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.510
and a lot of people live in fear.

374
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:50.729
For example,

375
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.979
for me to have come to your meeting.

376
00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:53.729
On Thursday

377
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.180
it will be seen.

378
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.780
Um,

379
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.500
that would have destroyed my chances.

380
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.270
To see,

381
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.260
to be seen,

382
00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.750
even looking casually not move.

383
00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:08.060
I,

384
00:18:08.109 --> 00:18:09.469
I didn't understand it.

385
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.140
If you could.

386
00:18:16.099 --> 00:18:17.739
I saw that you go to another.

387
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:20.109
That

388
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:21.859
that would be the end.

389
00:18:22.609 --> 00:18:23.530
I wouldn't be allowed.

390
00:18:25.719 --> 00:18:26.060
Oh,

391
00:18:26.069 --> 00:18:26.469
I

392
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.680
You know you've committed the cardinal 7 looking.

393
00:18:30.719 --> 00:18:31.170
Searching,

394
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:31.199
I see.

395
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:34.920
So there's an awful lot of fears that people are worried.

396
00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:36.260
Um,

397
00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:37.709
a friend of mine went to,

398
00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:38.420
uh,

399
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.300
Palms to sign.

400
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.589
And I too have been

401
00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:45.010
And she was told that that was her chance.

402
00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:48.449
For coming

403
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.010
So people didn't care.

404
00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:55.300
See that charge also if you go to other gurus,

405
00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.270
you catch me I'm not,

406
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.869
but apart from that you're free.

407
00:19:01.989 --> 00:19:03.369
You're free to go.

408
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.069
See,

409
00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:05.280
thing is so similar.

410
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.510
I'm just trying to see,

411
00:19:06.699 --> 00:19:08.300
but what is the subtle point?

412
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.819
You're free to go to anyone,

413
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:10.640
but if you catch,

414
00:19:10.719 --> 00:19:12.000
then I'll have to clear it out.

415
00:19:12.099 --> 00:19:12.479
That's all.

416
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.420
But you do catch and you yourself feel bad.

417
00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:18.310
That's it.

418
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.140
It's absolutely.

419
00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:19.500
I mean,

420
00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:20.410
nobody can.

421
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.099
all these other things.

422
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:30.560
Mm.

423
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.260
See,

424
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.079
there was a flux,

425
00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:34.400
an awful lot of people went to go.

426
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.290
Quite a few teachers thought he was better.

427
00:19:40.699 --> 00:19:40.849
Yeah.

428
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.829
I know that must be that I did push it up never speak it up like never speak.

429
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.339
So the first deception is that it's not the Shank.
