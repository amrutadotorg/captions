WEBVTT

01:05.200 --> 01:11.230
Today we have gathered here to worship the Adi Kundalini

01:12.030 --> 01:14.180
and your own Kundalini, both of them,

01:15.110 --> 01:18.110
because your Kundalini is the reflection

01:18.150 --> 01:20.070
of the Adi Kundalini.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.010
We have understood a lot

01:26.200 --> 01:28.170
about Kundalini

01:29.210 --> 01:34.010
and also we know that

01:34.070 --> 01:36.200
through Her awakening only,

01:37.010 --> 01:38.180
through Her ascent only,

01:39.000 --> 01:45.070
we have ascended into a very higher realm of consciousness.

01:46.040 --> 01:51.170
It's not only that we have risen to a very higher realm

01:51.210 --> 01:54.230
of awareness

01:55.060 --> 02:01.030
but that it has granted us so many powers that,

02:02.000 --> 02:07.180
never before in the history of spirituality

02:09.090 --> 02:11.040
people had

02:11.140 --> 02:15.230
this power of awakening of Kundalini.

02:17.230 --> 02:21.040
As soon as they got their awakening perhaps,

02:21.090 --> 02:24.070
they went more on to the left or to the right,

02:25.040 --> 02:28.210
and tried to achieve powers

02:29.210 --> 02:36.100
which were not so much for the benevolence of others.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.050
Buddha has written clearly

02:41.160 --> 02:44.210
that, “When the incarnation of future Buddha,

02:44.240 --> 02:49.050
that is Maitreya, three Mothers put together, comes in,

02:49.180 --> 02:56.040
that time it will be used for the benevolence of people.”

02:56.070 --> 02:58.100
This is one of the signs,

02:59.110 --> 03:01.100
"of the people",

03:01.160 --> 03:06.100
not only of Sahaja Yogis but of the people.

03:07.050 --> 03:14.150
So how can it be unless and until those who are Buddhas,

03:14.190 --> 03:16.220
means those who are Realized souls

03:17.180 --> 03:22.220
know the science of Kundalini?

03:24.240 --> 03:29.080
Those people who had very little knowledge about Kundalini,

03:29.240 --> 03:32.130
who must have read in some scriptures

03:32.190 --> 03:36.020
or somewhere which is being described,

03:39.130 --> 03:42.000
started misusing it

03:42.040 --> 03:44.190
and so they became tantrikas.

03:46.040 --> 03:49.040
But tantra, as you know very well,

03:50.020 --> 03:55.110
is the mechanism of Kundalini,

03:56.020 --> 04:01.070
and the yantra is the Kundalini itself,

04:02.150 --> 04:05.100
is the machine.

04:09.150 --> 04:11.150
Today I think,

04:11.190 --> 04:14.040
as we know so much about Kundalini,

04:14.130 --> 04:17.010
how it passes through different centers,

04:17.080 --> 04:21.130
how it rises, all those things as we know,

04:21.180 --> 04:27.020
we should find out how we can nourish our Kundalini.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.190
That's very important to know.

04:34.100 --> 04:40.130
First of all there's a big difference between

04:40.160 --> 04:45.160
you people and other people who got their Realization.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.240
First big difference is this,

04:51.080 --> 04:58.100
that this power you have achieved Sahaj, easily.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.190
Others had to go to Himalayas,

05:03.050 --> 05:07.210
stand in the cold air for days together, so many died,

05:08.020 --> 05:10.050
live in the caves,

05:10.150 --> 05:13.050
eating fruits,

05:13.160 --> 05:15.180
sometimes nothing.

05:18.010 --> 05:23.060
Even Buddha's time they had to use only one piece of cloth

05:23.090 --> 05:25.090
to cover their body

05:25.200 --> 05:31.060
and they had to ask for alms

05:33.220 --> 05:41.030
in the villages and somehow cook some food and eat it

05:41.110 --> 05:45.220
- whether it was cold or hot, no comforts.

05:46.050 --> 05:48.000
On the contrary,

05:48.090 --> 05:54.200
He taught them that you should give up all our comforts

05:56.200 --> 05:59.170
because you can live without comforts.

06:00.230 --> 06:05.200
But none of them got Realization

06:06.150 --> 06:09.110
and none of them could do the work

06:09.140 --> 06:12.040
of awakening of Kundalini.

06:17.030 --> 06:23.060
So the difference is too much,

06:23.140 --> 06:26.070
the way you got your Realization,

06:26.140 --> 06:32.010
the way your Kundalini, in a very Sahaj manner, was awakened

06:32.230 --> 06:36.170
and the way you are manifesting those powers

06:36.200 --> 06:38.150
that you have got.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.200
For example you can give Realization to others,

06:42.060 --> 06:44.030
you can cure others,

06:44.110 --> 06:47.040
you can feel the vibrations of others,

06:47.140 --> 06:49.000
there are some Sahaja Yogis

06:49.050 --> 06:53.080
who can control rain, sun, moon, everything.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.120
Sahaja Yogis, some of them,

06:56.170 --> 06:59.000
have tremendous powers of prayers.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.020
Just by praying they have saved the lives of many people.

07:06.120 --> 07:15.060
And these powers were available to some of them,

07:15.140 --> 07:22.230
even to the rishis and great munis on those days,

07:24.000 --> 07:31.000
but their powers were not based on love and compassion.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.130
This is your special field

07:33.160 --> 07:41.030
because you have to work for the benevolence of the people.

07:42.060 --> 07:45.110
Their field was to protect themselves

07:46.000 --> 07:49.060
or to destroy.

07:50.020 --> 07:55.020
So they developed powers of curses,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.140
like sharp,

07:57.230 --> 08:00.030
they could curse people.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.000
You haven't got that power;

08:03.110 --> 08:05.220
you cannot curse anyone.

08:06.230 --> 08:11.020
Very nicely that power I have cancelled.

08:15.020 --> 08:20.050
Nor do I curse, I can, but I never curse anyone,

08:20.160 --> 08:29.230
because our basis is love and compassion and tenderliness.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.130
They were very hot-tempered people, most of them,

08:34.160 --> 08:36.060
extremely hot temper,

08:37.040 --> 08:42.000
and sometimes they used also terrible harsh languages

08:42.030 --> 08:45.230
whenever they spoke about the people

08:46.010 --> 08:48.120
who were not realized or who were troubling them.

08:48.140 --> 08:50.190
This was very funny

08:51.090 --> 08:54.120
the way they were angry with the society,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.230
the way they described them.

09:01.150 --> 09:06.080
Some of them did not look at the society,

09:06.110 --> 09:08.060
did not denounce the society,

09:08.090 --> 09:11.110
did not say bad things about the society

09:12.040 --> 09:16.190
but they were only satisfied with themselves

09:17.040 --> 09:22.110
or they wrote about the blessings that they are having.

09:23.150 --> 09:25.220
But you have a new dimension;

09:26.080 --> 09:30.200
you have to use your powers

09:32.090 --> 09:35.180
for the benevolence of the people.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.080
So also, your Kundalini was awakened so Sahaj;

09:47.090 --> 09:51.220
it is because of the love and compassion of your Mother.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.090
So this time, we should say,

09:56.140 --> 09:59.120
your Kundalini can only be nourished

09:59.230 --> 10:04.060
if you develop within yourself

10:06.060 --> 10:12.140
the sense of pure love and pure compassion.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.140
First I've used the word “pure”, that's My name also.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.090
That means you have to be innocent to begin with.

10:24.220 --> 10:32.090
If you are not innocent then you have certain problems,

10:32.120 --> 10:35.010
maybe with your lust.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.060
Maybe your love might be directed

10:40.090 --> 10:44.090
towards some person, only.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.150
Kundalini is not like that.

10:47.210 --> 10:51.150
She rises, She goes to all the chakras,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.120
She doesn't get involved into any,

10:53.150 --> 10:56.200
She tries to cure every chakra, nourish that chakra,

10:57.010 --> 11:00.140
and She is only worried about Her ascent.

11:01.180 --> 11:05.010
In the same way a Sahaja Yogi

11:05.170 --> 11:08.100
should not get involved

11:09.000 --> 11:13.010
into any relationship as such.

11:14.010 --> 11:16.060
Is possible.

11:16.100 --> 11:20.060
You don't have to become like Buddha's disciples.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.100
For example, as I have always told you,

11:23.140 --> 11:24.210
the sap in the tree rises

11:25.010 --> 11:27.210
and goes to various parts of the tree

11:27.240 --> 11:31.030
and then evaporates or comes back.

11:32.170 --> 11:36.070
So this passage should be kept open,

11:38.150 --> 11:41.150
and once this passage is kept open

11:42.040 --> 11:48.090
the Kundalini can rise very easily without any trouble.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.230
But this passage can be closed,

11:53.070 --> 11:57.040
in case you get too much involved into one thing,

11:57.140 --> 12:02.100
because there are some people

12:06.010 --> 12:10.000
who get involved, say in their parents to begin with.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.090
All right, in the beginning I know,

12:12.140 --> 12:14.120
those who come in the beginning to Sahaja Yoga,

12:14.150 --> 12:18.100
will start saying, “Mother, my father's, sister's,

12:19.030 --> 12:23.090
husband's, this things, that, is sick,

12:23.200 --> 12:27.010
so will you please cure that person.” Very common.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.040
They'll write long, long letters

12:29.090 --> 12:30.140
describing the relationship

12:30.170 --> 12:36.010
and I really lose the connection - who is this one?

12:36.060 --> 12:37.150
Without writing the names

12:37.180 --> 12:40.010
they will give all the connections that they have.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.200
These are all artificial connections.

12:44.070 --> 12:47.040
Tomorrow some calamity comes on you,

12:47.200 --> 12:51.070
these relationships are of no use;

12:51.100 --> 12:54.140
on the contrary you'll find they'll take advantage of it.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.170
You cannot depend on these relations of yours,

12:58.240 --> 13:00.170
in what family you were born,

13:00.200 --> 13:02.070
in what religion you were born,

13:02.100 --> 13:04.170
in what country you are born,

13:05.200 --> 13:08.170
because now you are a universal being.

13:09.170 --> 13:13.210
So you are no more related

13:14.180 --> 13:17.070
through these artificial relationships

13:17.150 --> 13:22.200
but you are related through your spiritual relationships.

13:24.090 --> 13:29.000
Unless and until we establish that within ourselves

13:29.180 --> 13:31.180
- that doesn't mean you give up your husband,

13:32.000 --> 13:33.200
give up your wife, give up your children,

13:33.220 --> 13:35.230
nothing of the kind;

13:36.170 --> 13:41.000
but that means that if we have to give up our conditionings

13:41.140 --> 13:44.170
we have to give up all these things.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.070
There are all kinds of conditionings we have.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.150
If there are some good conditionings,

13:56.060 --> 13:57.150
still we should give up

13:57.180 --> 14:00.150
in the sense they should not be conditionings

14:00.210 --> 14:02.230
but we should be master of them.

14:03.030 --> 14:06.060
For example Indians have one good conditioning, in a way,

14:06.110 --> 14:07.150
in their own country,

14:07.180 --> 14:10.120
that they must have their bath early in the morning.

14:11.140 --> 14:13.120
I used to do the same.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.120
Then England is horrible for that.

14:17.070 --> 14:20.120
It takes its respite, if you do that in England,

14:20.200 --> 14:22.170
it's a cursed country,

14:23.000 --> 14:24.200
you just can't do that.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.140
You have to take your bath in the night

14:26.170 --> 14:28.200
otherwise give up bathing;

14:30.030 --> 14:31.120
and one has to change.

14:31.130 --> 14:33.050
But if you have that conditioning,

14:33.110 --> 14:35.110
then you will feel very sad,

14:35.140 --> 14:37.160
“Oh, oh, I've missed my bath, I'm feeling,

14:37.210 --> 14:42.070
I can't sleep now, I can't feel all right, I am not normal.”

14:42.130 --> 14:46.110
It’s a good conditioning but still it is enslaving you.

14:47.130 --> 14:49.190
So whether it is good or bad,

14:49.240 --> 14:51.190
if it is a conditioning

14:52.110 --> 14:56.130
you should try to see it clearly, it's a conditioning.

14:59.110 --> 15:01.000
That doesn't mean that you should go

15:01.030 --> 15:02.070
in the opposite direction,

15:02.110 --> 15:04.010
that, "All right I'll never have my bath",

15:04.040 --> 15:06.000
that's not the way.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.010
It is that,

15:11.090 --> 15:14.010
"All right if it doesn't suit in the morning

15:14.060 --> 15:15.110
I'll have it in the evening,

15:15.150 --> 15:17.170
also doesn't matter once in a while I'll miss it.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.120
The bath cannot control me, I'll control the bath."

15:23.060 --> 15:24.230
Nothing should control you,

15:25.030 --> 15:27.110
then the Kundalini moves for us,

15:27.170 --> 15:30.120
because you must have complete liberty.

15:31.070 --> 15:33.150
If you do not have complete liberty

15:33.230 --> 15:36.010
then the Kundalini won't move.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.210
We have conditionings of our families,

15:44.030 --> 15:47.010
of our religion,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.030
of our country.

15:51.230 --> 15:55.150
These conditionings, as far as possible,

15:55.220 --> 16:00.120
is to be seen clearly that we have got it through our

16:03.000 --> 16:04.070
family.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.170
If you are born a Christian

16:07.060 --> 16:10.010
you'll always be more attached to Christ.

16:11.010 --> 16:12.120
Christ you have not seen,

16:12.150 --> 16:14.150
you don't know whether He existed or not,

16:14.210 --> 16:16.140
whether this Bible is true or not

16:16.180 --> 16:18.180
but you'll be more attached to Bible.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.230
Now if you are a Hindu,

16:21.010 --> 16:25.040
you'll be more attached to Gita or to Vedas or something.

16:25.220 --> 16:29.010
This creates imbalance,

16:30.110 --> 16:34.000
because we must have the same attitude

16:34.060 --> 16:37.180
towards all the religions, towards all the scriptures;

16:37.210 --> 16:40.140
that's the sign of a saint.

16:44.070 --> 16:47.070
So this conditioning has to go.

16:48.030 --> 16:52.140
In what country you are born is another conditioning

16:52.180 --> 16:54.150
which has to be fought out;

16:55.000 --> 16:57.030
very important it is.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.000
I don't want to discuss the conditionings

17:01.040 --> 17:04.040
of different countries but you know very well.

17:04.090 --> 17:07.030
After Realization when you rise higher

17:07.070 --> 17:09.200
than your society which is surrounding you,

17:10.040 --> 17:14.070
you start understanding and you start describing.

17:14.150 --> 17:16.200
I've come to know about the stupidity

17:17.120 --> 17:19.150
of all these countries through the people

17:19.180 --> 17:21.150
who belong to that country.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.150
For example a Frenchman will say,

17:23.180 --> 17:27.140
“Mother, this is typical French mind,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.040
he's a French otherwise born.”

17:30.150 --> 17:32.000
Or a Hindu will say,

17:32.060 --> 17:35.000
“Mother, this is typically a Hindu man,

17:35.030 --> 17:36.200
he will do like this.”

17:37.110 --> 17:40.170
So then you understand that you are not typifying

17:40.220 --> 17:42.070
that country,

17:42.140 --> 17:44.030
you are a universal being

17:44.090 --> 17:47.000
and you are living like a universal being.

17:50.090 --> 17:52.210
Once you become the universal being

17:53.040 --> 17:57.200
then also you realize that this skin-deep complexion

17:57.230 --> 18:00.000
makes no difference in the world.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.060
So then you don't start hating somebody

18:05.110 --> 18:09.090
who is darker than you or who is fairer than you;

18:09.120 --> 18:11.030
both ways it works.

18:11.110 --> 18:16.230
It's not only the people who are fair hate the darker ones,

18:17.010 --> 18:19.170
but “darkers” also hate equally.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.220
And mutually they believe that they are all

18:24.070 --> 18:26.110
absolutely wrong.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.120
If you ask a fanatic

18:32.060 --> 18:35.000
about another religion he'll say,

18:35.040 --> 18:37.180
that's the worst religion, his is the best.

18:38.010 --> 18:41.030
And you ask the another fanatic,

18:41.110 --> 18:46.060
he will say his is the best, the rest of it is the worst.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.170
That means all of them are the worst,

18:48.230 --> 18:50.110
in a general opinion.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.010
Everybody seems to be the worst,

18:52.040 --> 18:53.180
all the fanatics are the worst,

18:54.010 --> 18:56.200
if you take a general consensus, you see.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.230
Nobody will say that,

18:59.030 --> 19:00.150
"All right, my religion is all right

19:00.200 --> 19:03.220
and at least one another is all right", nobody.

19:06.060 --> 19:08.040
If you ask an Englishman he'll say,

19:08.060 --> 19:12.070
“Mother, this is typically English, you can't help it.”

19:13.110 --> 19:16.120
They get so angry, I've seen the English getting angry

19:16.150 --> 19:18.070
with the other English for misbehaving

19:18.110 --> 19:21.110
or doing something towards Me, but I don't,

19:21.140 --> 19:23.180
because they are blind.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.110
So here the compassion should come within you,

19:27.150 --> 19:28.200
as a universal being,

19:29.000 --> 19:32.180
that by God's grace you have risen higher

19:32.200 --> 19:34.110
in the real sense of the word.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.070
It is not just you are certified,

19:36.120 --> 19:38.030
you are realized souls, no.

19:38.120 --> 19:44.200
You are realized souls, no doubt, you are - sakshat.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.170
So then, as it is now, you are absolutely certified by God

19:49.200 --> 19:51.230
that you are realized souls.

19:52.220 --> 19:55.170
Naturally you must change everything.

19:58.070 --> 20:02.070
No use typifying yourself, identifying yourself

20:05.040 --> 20:10.170
with something that is now, you have given up.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.180
For example, from the egg now you have become the birds.

20:14.030 --> 20:18.090
Now birds don't identify themselves with the eggs

20:18.120 --> 20:21.110
and settle down in only one place, they fly.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.030
Now they have become birds, they are no more eggs.

20:24.180 --> 20:28.000
In the same way we should accept our position.

20:28.170 --> 20:33.070
We should accept ourselves as realized souls

20:33.110 --> 20:36.150
with self-esteem and understanding

20:36.200 --> 20:39.090
as to what is our purpose of life now;

20:39.120 --> 20:41.180
it is changed completely, entirely.

20:42.170 --> 20:45.070
Once you understand the purpose of your life,

20:45.120 --> 20:48.090
innately, not outside because I am saying,

20:48.140 --> 20:50.000
or is a mental process,

20:50.030 --> 20:53.030
but inside you feel responsible.

20:53.070 --> 20:57.140
You have got Realization to spread it all over the world

20:57.180 --> 21:00.120
and to emancipate the whole world.

21:01.070 --> 21:03.200
Once you realize this point

21:04.110 --> 21:07.060
then automatically you take up responsibilities

21:07.110 --> 21:09.120
and the Kundalini will rise.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.060
I know of many people who said,

21:13.090 --> 21:16.010
“Mother, we cannot speak, You know we have a stage fright.”

21:16.060 --> 21:18.170
All right, you just stand up, that's all.

21:20.060 --> 21:23.180
And they started giving lectures; I had to stop them.

21:26.170 --> 21:28.120
There are many who said that,

21:28.150 --> 21:31.060
“We cannot write any poems Mother, we are no good,

21:31.090 --> 21:32.230
we cannot sing.”

21:33.080 --> 21:36.030
I know of a girl who used to sing so horribly bad

21:36.170 --> 21:38.090
that people had to tell her that you…

21:38.160 --> 21:40.090
because she would always go out of tune

21:40.120 --> 21:42.080
and very loudly she would sing;

21:42.220 --> 21:43.220
then they had to tell her,

21:44.000 --> 21:45.060
“Now you better keep at the back

21:45.110 --> 21:47.060
and don't sing now any more.”

21:47.170 --> 21:51.220
Now she is the one who is sort of leading the group.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.030
So all these beautiful things start manifesting

21:56.080 --> 21:59.050
which you should accept that they have come to you,

22:00.080 --> 22:05.020
and give up all that you call as fear.

22:07.170 --> 22:10.090
All kinds of fear we have.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.030
These are all left-sided things as you have seen yesterday,

22:15.060 --> 22:17.050
left-sided man what he should do.

22:18.160 --> 22:23.000
But what a left-sided man has to know

22:23.060 --> 22:26.200
that he is now an enlightened soul

22:27.170 --> 22:32.140
and no one can touch him, leave alone destroy.

22:33.090 --> 22:36.140
No saint will be destroyed.

22:36.210 --> 22:39.240
Those who will try to destroy you

22:40.040 --> 22:44.060
will, in a very interesting manner, will be finished.

22:45.010 --> 22:47.240
Not destroyed but very interesting manner,

22:48.020 --> 22:51.060
very jocular manner.

22:51.130 --> 22:53.090
You'll laugh at

22:53.180 --> 22:56.240
that and you will enjoy the way things are working out.

22:57.090 --> 22:59.060
Like there's a saying in Sanskrit,

22:59.120 --> 23:01.120
“vinashkale viprit budhi,”

23:01.170 --> 23:04.100
means their destruction will start

23:04.150 --> 23:07.170
by their own stupid methods.

23:08.030 --> 23:10.010
They'll become stupid.

23:10.130 --> 23:13.170
And at every stage you'll see they are becoming stupid

23:14.120 --> 23:17.120
and by that stupidity they are destroying themselves.

23:17.150 --> 23:19.120
You don't have to worry about that part.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.020
So that's why you don't need any destructive powers.

23:22.170 --> 23:28.010
It will all be done by this all-pervading Divine Power.

23:28.230 --> 23:30.230
So that part you have to give up.

23:31.060 --> 23:34.060
You just forgive that person.

23:35.210 --> 23:37.240
As soon as you forgive,

23:39.210 --> 23:42.130
the responsibility from you shifts

23:44.010 --> 23:46.120
and then Kundalini rises.

23:47.100 --> 23:51.100
You don't have to carry any malice, anything against him,

23:51.150 --> 23:55.040
but just laugh because they are blind,

23:55.210 --> 23:57.240
because they are stupid,

23:58.040 --> 23:59.180
they are foolish.

24:01.030 --> 24:04.060
What do we do if you see an idiot?

24:05.010 --> 24:07.130
We may not laugh in his presence but we do,

24:07.170 --> 24:11.130
isn't it, at his back, because he's an idiot.

24:12.170 --> 24:15.170
So they become idiotic

24:16.100 --> 24:20.030
and you see them becoming idiotic and then you just start.

24:20.070 --> 24:21.240
You see that's the humor of Sahaja Yoga,

24:22.030 --> 24:24.120
you have to have some humor also, isn't it?

24:25.150 --> 24:28.060
And then you start seeing these jokers you see,

24:28.100 --> 24:30.020
behaving in that manner

24:30.120 --> 24:35.150
and the whole circus they do is nothing but jocular.

24:36.180 --> 24:40.150
So there's nothing to have any fear from any human being;

24:41.180 --> 24:44.060
same about organizations or anything.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.200
Naturally you have to know one thing:

24:47.060 --> 24:49.060
that as you are Realized souls,

24:49.240 --> 24:51.100
you have seen the truth,

24:51.150 --> 24:53.180
you are in the light so they are going to oppose you,

24:53.210 --> 24:55.150
they are going to oppose you.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.190
They did this, isn't it, to others;

25:01.090 --> 25:04.150
everybody suffered so much.

25:06.180 --> 25:09.100
But now no more sufferings to you,

25:09.210 --> 25:13.160
only thing you can enjoy the humor.

25:15.060 --> 25:17.150
Just understand this point,

25:17.220 --> 25:21.140
that nothing will destroy you, no one can touch you

25:21.220 --> 25:26.080
but they are there just to supply some humor for you.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.230
If you take such a light attitude towards them,

25:30.030 --> 25:33.040
all this fear and left side will go away.

25:34.230 --> 25:38.170
What are these baddhas, and what are these bhoots,

25:38.220 --> 25:41.120
and what are these tantrikas? Nothing.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.150
You are so powerful.

25:43.220 --> 25:45.140
Just with one glance

25:45.190 --> 25:48.000
you can see them dancing on their heads,

25:48.140 --> 25:50.080
the other way round.

25:51.220 --> 25:54.110
As long as you'll have fear

25:54.150 --> 25:59.030
Kundalini won't rise because She doesn't rise for people

25:59.090 --> 26:01.060
who are cowards.

26:02.010 --> 26:04.200
Cowardice She is not going to support.

26:05.010 --> 26:07.170
If you are a coward She said, “All right”.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.140
You are walking on the street,

26:11.230 --> 26:15.120
normally people are afraid if there's darkness,

26:15.180 --> 26:19.030
afraid that somebody might attack,

26:19.140 --> 26:21.090
but a Sahaja Yogi does not,

26:21.140 --> 26:22.150
if he's a real Sahaja Yogi,

26:22.200 --> 26:25.060
because he knows there are ganas

26:25.110 --> 26:27.030
and there are angels around him.

26:27.060 --> 26:29.010
No one can touch him,

26:29.150 --> 26:31.110
and the one who will try,

26:32.010 --> 26:34.230
these ganas will make such a fool out of that person

26:35.030 --> 26:37.120
that you'll have a nice chance to laugh at him.

26:39.110 --> 26:41.080
Now you watch and see.

26:42.230 --> 26:47.200
So this left side or this fear should go.

26:47.230 --> 26:51.000
Once this fear will go all your slyness,

26:51.060 --> 26:57.200
all your intrigues, all your jealousies will just disappear.

26:59.220 --> 27:04.010
That's how the Kundalini will rise very well.

27:09.040 --> 27:16.120
Then another problem is for the awakening of the Kundalini,

27:16.170 --> 27:18.140
is your ego.

27:18.190 --> 27:21.040
That's tremendous, I must admit,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.040
rather too much for people who follow Christ,

27:25.080 --> 27:29.000
is very surprising and those who follow Buddha,

27:30.170 --> 27:32.230
because they are anti-Christ,

27:33.060 --> 27:35.200
because they are anti-Buddha.

27:36.110 --> 27:39.120
The one who on the cross said that,

27:39.170 --> 27:40.120
“Oh Father,

27:40.170 --> 27:44.000
forgive them for they do not know what they are doing”;

27:44.090 --> 27:47.230
if you are following Him how can you have ego?

27:52.230 --> 28:01.040
Now the forgiveness should be absolutely spontaneous within.

28:06.060 --> 28:11.190
There should be no ripple even of anger

28:12.000 --> 28:14.150
because you are so powerful.

28:17.190 --> 28:21.090
What can anybody harm you?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.170
But if you catch on your Agnya,

28:23.200 --> 28:25.060
only you are harming yourself.

28:25.090 --> 28:28.090
If you want to harm yourself nobody can help it.

28:31.040 --> 28:34.190
So this anger, which comes from liver

28:34.230 --> 28:41.080
and settles down in your Agnya, has to be looked into.

28:42.090 --> 28:45.190
That's a very important thing where Kundalini stops,

28:45.220 --> 28:47.230
in the West specially.

28:50.240 --> 28:57.130
Because this whole culture here has created two problems.

28:58.220 --> 29:04.020
The first one is acquisition instinct,

29:06.000 --> 29:09.130
what you call as greed.

29:10.130 --> 29:14.130
The more greed you have the more these machines can run

29:14.170 --> 29:19.140
and you can have industrial development of plastics,

29:20.030 --> 29:24.060
and then have a conference against ecology.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.100
In Spain I saw,

29:30.020 --> 29:32.200
I don't know, there must be three, four car factories

29:32.240 --> 29:35.080
because every car had only one driver

29:35.130 --> 29:37.170
because it had to be there.

29:38.190 --> 29:41.110
And so many cars

29:42.080 --> 29:45.060
that you just don't know how to move.

29:45.100 --> 29:48.130
For your program also is impossible,

29:48.170 --> 29:50.130
you must start two hours earlier

29:50.170 --> 29:52.200
when you can just take fifteen minutes.

29:53.170 --> 29:57.020
In France is another thing, Paris.

29:57.220 --> 30:00.050
Paris, if you want to go somewhere

30:00.100 --> 30:03.130
you should start at four o'clock in the morning,

30:04.060 --> 30:07.060
otherwise you cannot reach that place.

30:09.050 --> 30:13.190
Same about Milan and same about Rome.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.140
The worst is Switzerland,

30:17.020 --> 30:19.040
I don't know what to say about Switzerland,

30:20.100 --> 30:24.040
the name itself is rather, very dangerous,

30:29.240 --> 30:33.190
because they are making all ugly money,

30:33.240 --> 30:35.070
they are doing all these things,

30:35.100 --> 30:37.160
I mean every kind of sin they have got

30:37.210 --> 30:40.150
in the name of acquisition.

30:40.230 --> 30:43.230
For them nothing like sin, taking somebody's money nicely,

30:44.040 --> 30:47.070
keeping that there, extracting money from poor countries,

30:47.130 --> 30:49.210
keeping, they don't feel there's anything wrong,

30:49.240 --> 30:52.010
I mean, they have become immune.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.150
So this acquisition instinct that we have

30:58.230 --> 31:00.200
and which has been very much fanned

31:00.240 --> 31:06.240
and has been made into a big sort of a quality in the West,

31:09.070 --> 31:13.150
we should try to see it clearly.

31:14.150 --> 31:18.090
In the olden days in the same European countries

31:19.090 --> 31:22.120
this was used for creating art,

31:23.230 --> 31:27.130
for producing artist, for supporting artist.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.040
Even in our country,

31:30.070 --> 31:32.200
artists were supported by the kings

31:32.240 --> 31:36.090
and all the big empires that we had.

31:38.180 --> 31:41.020
These days there's no question,

31:41.060 --> 31:44.070
no government is willing to support the artist.

31:45.090 --> 31:48.150
You know that Mozart was called by the queen herself

31:48.240 --> 31:50.240
to play before her.

31:52.100 --> 31:56.020
So the governments were not only looking after

31:56.050 --> 31:58.010
the collection of taxes

31:58.100 --> 32:00.200
but they were looking after the artists,

32:01.010 --> 32:07.130
musicians, painters and people who did creative art.

32:09.230 --> 32:11.240
Like in France you can see

32:12.210 --> 32:16.120
how their queen collected beautiful artistic things

32:16.160 --> 32:18.240
and encouraged artists

32:21.020 --> 32:23.090
to do artistic work,

32:23.130 --> 32:25.180
spent her money in that,

32:26.150 --> 32:30.200
and now, you know that she was killed by people.

32:31.100 --> 32:35.100
By killing her they have killed the art of France.

32:40.180 --> 32:44.090
And now the French themselves have become bourgeois,

32:44.130 --> 32:47.130
those whom they condemned, they have become that.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.120
So acquisition instinct

32:51.180 --> 33:00.020
has to be taken to the acquisition of art.

33:03.020 --> 33:08.010
That also should not be plastic

33:08.060 --> 33:11.160
otherwise tomorrow we might start buying plastic

33:11.200 --> 33:13.240
artistic things.

33:14.150 --> 33:18.180
Genuinely made, hand made things.

33:22.010 --> 33:25.240
Or the music also which is very deep,

33:26.040 --> 33:31.130
classical, singing the songs of the Divine;

33:31.180 --> 33:35.070
not the cheap type music which just makes you mad

33:35.100 --> 33:41.160
or makes you full of lust and greed.

33:43.010 --> 33:46.040
So this is one of the problems of your culture

33:46.100 --> 33:51.230
which gives you this kind of a ego.

33:54.060 --> 34:01.060
I mean, people if they have say, a Rolls Royce

34:02.060 --> 34:04.160
then of course nobody can talk to them,

34:04.200 --> 34:09.070
their brain has blown out of their hats, completely.

34:09.120 --> 34:12.210
But even the driver of the Rolls Royce

34:13.200 --> 34:16.060
who doesn't own the Rolls Royce, he drives it,

34:16.100 --> 34:18.170
his head is off.

34:19.130 --> 34:22.150
He has a different gait, he walks in a different way,

34:22.200 --> 34:25.040
he talks in a different way.

34:30.040 --> 34:35.150
So this acquisition instinct gives you so much of ego.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.180
I mean, you go to somebody's house,

34:39.070 --> 34:42.180
like some stupid Indians who are now in England

34:44.010 --> 34:46.010
I went to their house;

34:46.060 --> 34:50.240
they're sadarjis - means following the path of Guru Nanaka

34:51.040 --> 34:53.200
where drinking is not allowed.

34:54.070 --> 34:58.230
So as soon as you rise he shows us a pub in his house.

34:59.130 --> 35:03.240
“My God,” I said. I went back three, four steps, you see.

35:05.130 --> 35:09.060
He says, “See my pubu,” as he says,

35:09.230 --> 35:14.090
and from the pub he takes out a soda thing and shows us how

35:14.150 --> 35:17.100
it pumps out the soda, just imagine

35:20.070 --> 35:22.180
and he wouldn't talk, you know.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.120
And when we said, "We don't drink,"

35:25.180 --> 35:28.240
he thought we were sinners of the worst type,

35:30.040 --> 35:32.070
that we don't drink.

35:33.120 --> 35:37.040
So this acquisition instinct is now ending up

35:37.200 --> 35:44.020
into something which is very cheap, vulgar and immoral.

35:49.170 --> 35:52.170
The fondness for showing off

35:53.030 --> 35:57.220
is so much that you are sometimes shocked,

35:58.140 --> 36:01.120
the way people try to show off.

36:02.050 --> 36:05.090
Like a American lady came from America

36:06.000 --> 36:08.060
and she asked Me, “Mrs. Srivastava,

36:08.090 --> 36:11.030
how many pubs You have seen in London?”

36:12.020 --> 36:13.090
I said, “None.”

36:13.120 --> 36:20.190
“Oh, You are good for nothing, useless, absolutely.

36:21.030 --> 36:25.190
You haven't seen any pub. The best houses in any village,

36:25.230 --> 36:28.140
any city in England is a pub.”

36:29.100 --> 36:31.040
I said, “From outside I have seen.”

36:31.100 --> 36:33.020
All right, just to satisfy;

36:33.070 --> 36:35.070
I thought she’s artistic.

36:36.120 --> 36:41.190
“No, no, no, no. Do You know the best pub in London?”

36:42.020 --> 36:44.160
She gave Me the list, you know.

36:46.210 --> 36:48.200
I said, “Which one is the best?”

36:48.240 --> 36:51.120
“There was one called Hermit's Pub.”

36:52.100 --> 36:54.190
I said: "What is this supposed to be?"

36:55.070 --> 37:00.040
"You know, the man who was living in this house died

37:00.160 --> 37:03.070
and nobody knew that he's dead,

37:04.100 --> 37:09.070
so for months together nobody went in

37:09.130 --> 37:12.100
and the whole place was filled with that stink,

37:13.050 --> 37:16.040
and lots of cobwebs were there.

37:16.240 --> 37:19.200
Then they removed that

37:22.100 --> 37:24.130
dead body from there,

37:24.160 --> 37:27.240
and the stink is still there and the cobwebs,

37:28.040 --> 37:30.090
absolutely intact, you know.

37:31.070 --> 37:34.070
You have to be careful that you don't break them.

37:35.070 --> 37:40.040
And there, that is the best pub,

37:40.090 --> 37:43.090
for which you have to pay quite a lot.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.130
And I have seen that.”

37:45.160 --> 37:50.160
So proud. So where does it end then?

37:51.070 --> 37:55.200
This acquisition instinct ends in where?

37:57.010 --> 38:00.210
In rottening things, in putrefying,

38:02.040 --> 38:04.120
you may call it fermenting.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.050
It has to end up

38:10.120 --> 38:12.160
because the reaction of the ego comes

38:12.210 --> 38:17.130
and you start enjoying things which are rotten.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.240
Like cheese of France,

38:21.100 --> 38:26.090
never eat that, I tell you, you'll burn your finger,

38:26.180 --> 38:30.150
you will burn your throat and you'll burn your stomach.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.020
It is very rotten,

38:34.180 --> 38:37.150
and the more rotten it is the better.

38:39.020 --> 38:43.100
The wine, the wine is the rotten grape juice,

38:43.150 --> 38:45.040
absolutely rotten,

38:45.070 --> 38:46.180
you can't take it,

38:46.230 --> 38:51.200
it smells, I've seen smells like a rotten cork.

38:54.010 --> 38:56.130
I asked somebody, “How does it smell?”

38:56.180 --> 38:58.200
He said, “It's very fine.”

38:59.010 --> 39:03.050
I said, “Does it smell like rotten cork?”

39:03.090 --> 39:05.050
“I've never smelt a cork.”

39:05.160 --> 39:08.210
That's why I said - if he had smelt a rotten cork

39:09.010 --> 39:11.180
he would never have taken to wine;

39:12.070 --> 39:15.230
so all things that are rotten.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.200
You know the discovery of cheese, what had happened,

39:18.210 --> 39:20.190
how it started, do you know that?

39:21.150 --> 39:27.010
There was a big snowfall and milk was left in one cave.

39:27.160 --> 39:31.180
So because of the snowfall everybody forgot about the milk,

39:32.010 --> 39:37.210
it was left there, then summer time the milk became rotten,

39:38.010 --> 39:40.150
then it became more rotten, more rotten.

39:40.240 --> 39:45.020
After twelve years or so, somebody went and saw this there.

39:54.090 --> 39:57.160
Thank God I have not taken My food today.

40:02.010 --> 40:06.120
And so they took that milk,

40:06.150 --> 40:09.040
they called it cheese.

40:13.020 --> 40:17.120
In India cheez is used in Urdu language specially,

40:17.160 --> 40:19.200
for something which is,

40:20.040 --> 40:23.120
something special thing, something very special,

40:23.210 --> 40:26.120
and also as you know in music they use it

40:26.160 --> 40:31.240
for some special composition, cheez.

40:33.150 --> 40:40.070
But here the cheese is the most rotten milk

40:41.020 --> 40:44.240
which no human beings or animals should eat.

40:45.100 --> 40:49.070
Worms may, so they gave it to worms,

40:49.150 --> 40:57.020
and I know in Holland and also in Sweden I think, yah,

40:59.230 --> 41:02.230
they had cheese with worms

41:03.040 --> 41:05.130
and they were eating the worms;

41:05.200 --> 41:09.040
can you beat it, it is true;

41:10.050 --> 41:12.240
not only the cheese but also the worms.

41:14.240 --> 41:17.020
I mean see where we have ended up

41:17.070 --> 41:19.240
into our acquisition instinct.

41:22.020 --> 41:25.240
The wine has to be hundred year old, certified,

41:26.020 --> 41:27.160
that's the best.

41:30.130 --> 41:34.020
Such rotten things we are eating,

41:34.060 --> 41:37.020
they smell, I tell you, they smell of it.

41:37.090 --> 41:40.120
That's why, once I was surprised that,

41:40.240 --> 41:43.160
they go to the bathroom, don't even wash their hands.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.070
We get such horrible smells, they don't get

41:46.100 --> 41:48.050
because if you take that cheese

41:48.100 --> 41:50.210
you cannot smell anything rotten.

41:51.190 --> 41:53.120
Even if you put them in the gutters

41:53.160 --> 41:54.210
they won't feel anything rotten

41:55.010 --> 41:59.020
because it's all that dirty smell, they are used to.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.120
Is the filth, I mean even if they go to hell

42:02.150 --> 42:05.050
they won't feel bad because the smell will be the same.

42:11.070 --> 42:13.210
So where should we put them?

42:16.100 --> 42:19.040
They are so immune to that dirty smell

42:20.120 --> 42:23.230
which is absolutely sub-human.

42:25.070 --> 42:29.120
So this acquisition instinct in any elite society

42:29.200 --> 42:32.180
- once upon a time French society was regarded as elite

42:57.070 --> 43:00.200
- so the most elite society was the French society

43:01.000 --> 43:07.010
was most diplomatic in every way.

43:07.140 --> 43:11.200
Their food was made with wine, everything was wine,

43:12.230 --> 43:17.140
and this diplomatic society once upon… ruled the whole

43:17.180 --> 43:19.220
diplomatic areas.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.030
But they never realized

43:25.200 --> 43:32.000
that the whole culture was nothing but eating and drinking.

43:33.140 --> 43:37.080
Nothing else but eating and drinking.

43:39.220 --> 43:43.110
And later on maybe little politics started.

43:44.150 --> 43:47.220
But this eating and drinking

43:48.150 --> 43:51.010
went to such a limit

43:52.040 --> 43:55.230
that now they have gone out of diplomatic areas;

43:56.010 --> 44:00.170
no one wants them because they never think in the right way.

44:00.220 --> 44:03.090
Any diplomat, French diplomat is anywhere,

44:03.150 --> 44:06.030
people say, “Is he French?” “Yes.”

44:06.110 --> 44:08.080
“Then better not call him for this meeting,

44:08.120 --> 44:13.140
you know, he'll put his own ideas.” They went out.

44:14.030 --> 44:18.220
So now that eliteness is shifted in America.

44:19.120 --> 44:22.060
So the most elite are taking to drugs.

44:22.090 --> 44:24.010
What is it after all?

44:24.040 --> 44:28.120
Drugs is creation of this acquisition instinct only.

44:31.010 --> 44:34.180
Why should you blame Colombians or anybody else?

44:34.190 --> 44:36.000
They are making their money, all right

44:36.030 --> 44:37.200
as you are all making,

44:38.060 --> 44:40.170
but the one they are feeding is America,

44:40.220 --> 44:45.110
and America is the main thing now in acquisition instinct.

44:45.190 --> 44:47.200
And what are they acquiring?

44:48.060 --> 44:50.110
I have been in that society,

44:50.150 --> 44:53.000
they only talk of drugs.

44:53.010 --> 44:54.200
All right,

44:55.030 --> 44:57.120
drugs they talk not only that

44:57.140 --> 45:00.030
but it's like a shopping of drugs.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.060
They all know where you get drugs,

45:03.090 --> 45:06.080
all these so-called ambassadors and these people,

45:06.120 --> 45:08.080
and their wives.

45:08.150 --> 45:11.160
With all their dresses have become simpler now,

45:11.170 --> 45:14.120
they do not dress up the way formerly

45:14.150 --> 45:16.230
the ambassadors’ wives used to dress up.

45:17.050 --> 45:21.190
I will not be surprised if they come in holey pants.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
So this acquisition instinct you can see in the

45:28.050 --> 45:31.050
elite society has ended up into drugs,

45:31.200 --> 45:36.060
and if not, into gurus - false gurus.

45:36.120 --> 45:39.110
Those who got fed up with this went to false gurus

45:39.140 --> 45:41.110
because they have no discrimination

45:41.150 --> 45:44.090
to know what is right and what is wrong.

45:46.120 --> 45:51.080
See, step by step, how it has gone into the rotten state,

45:51.120 --> 45:54.140
this ego, in the West.

45:54.200 --> 45:57.010
So this is the first point,

45:57.190 --> 46:02.020
is the acquisition instinct you have.

46:02.110 --> 46:05.170
In that then somebody’s wife is good-looking,

46:05.220 --> 46:09.160
then every man has a right to look at her.

46:10.030 --> 46:13.160
Or some man is good-looking, maybe anybody’s husband

46:13.190 --> 46:15.230
– every woman has right to look at him.

46:16.010 --> 46:18.080
Not look at her own husband but another man,

46:18.110 --> 46:20.000
what’s the use?

46:20.030 --> 46:21.160
I’ve never been able to understand,

46:21.200 --> 46:23.160
“What’s the use of looking at another man

46:23.200 --> 46:26.010
who is not your husband?”

46:29.030 --> 46:32.220
This acquisition instinct has gone

46:33.010 --> 46:38.080
into complete immoral life, immoral society

46:38.160 --> 46:46.190
and they have lost sense of respect of their age.

46:48.030 --> 46:52.190
A ninety-year-old woman having a love affair

46:52.200 --> 46:55.160
with a grandson who is eighteen-year-old;

46:55.230 --> 47:01.000
just think of that, such stupidity, such nonsense.

47:01.170 --> 47:05.140
How is it possible unless and until

47:05.190 --> 47:11.050
we have some sort of a perverted acquisition instinct?

47:11.220 --> 47:14.140
Even art has gone into perversion,

47:14.230 --> 47:17.200
everything has gone into perversion

47:22.160 --> 47:26.170
- because the curse of the Western society is that

47:26.200 --> 47:29.170
there is no maryada.

47:30.190 --> 47:34.140
And Kundalini rises in its own maryada,

47:35.140 --> 47:38.080
it brings back your maryadas,

47:38.120 --> 47:40.190
it keeps you into your maryadas.

47:40.220 --> 47:42.140
You are a human being,

47:42.190 --> 47:45.140
don't live like animals, even worse than animals.

47:45.190 --> 47:50.000
You have no right to do that.

47:50.050 --> 47:53.220
God has not created you to be sub-human

47:54.010 --> 47:56.170
but to be super-human being.

47:56.230 --> 48:00.170
So, this is how it works out.

48:02.190 --> 48:05.090
You can now think about it, how far it goes

48:05.120 --> 48:07.170
this acquisition instinct,

48:09.080 --> 48:11.090
about things.

48:13.110 --> 48:16.190
But the second very bad curse

48:17.120 --> 48:22.000
of the Western acquisition instinct is

48:22.030 --> 48:27.030
that they want to acquire, aggress, others.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.120
Aggression, the aggressiveness.

48:36.050 --> 48:39.160
They think they have a right to aggress other countries,

48:39.200 --> 48:43.050
I mean they aggressed our country for three hundred years.

48:43.080 --> 48:46.200
Why? Why did they aggress? We are not bad people.

48:47.010 --> 48:51.090
Because we had gold, we had diamonds,

48:52.080 --> 48:55.030
we had pearls,

48:55.170 --> 48:57.110
we had lots of things

48:57.140 --> 49:01.080
which were just material things for which they aggressed us,

49:01.120 --> 49:04.190
and they didn't take any spirituality from India.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.110
So the French aggressed, these aggressed,

49:07.140 --> 49:08.190
all the time aggressing.

49:08.230 --> 49:11.200
Japanese are also following you.

49:14.090 --> 49:17.110
This aggression then moves the whole society

49:17.160 --> 49:21.010
into a very destructive force.

49:21.160 --> 49:25.000
You can see every day the wars are going on,

49:25.030 --> 49:27.010
this is fighting that, that is fighting that,

49:27.060 --> 49:29.110
they want this, they want that.

49:29.170 --> 49:32.120
And this aggression has also penetrated

49:32.160 --> 49:35.060
the developing countries, the third world also.

49:35.090 --> 49:39.160
So, nicely the disease is on.

49:43.140 --> 49:49.050
But Kundalini kills that acquisition.

49:50.050 --> 49:53.060
How? By giving you joy.

49:55.050 --> 49:57.160
You enjoy everything.

49:58.090 --> 50:01.030
You are sitting in a jungle, you are enjoying,

50:01.140 --> 50:04.140
here in uncomfortable conditions, you enjoy

50:04.190 --> 50:08.120
because you seek the comfort of your spirit,

50:08.160 --> 50:09.230
because that gives you joy

50:10.020 --> 50:13.110
- ultimately that's what you get out of everything.

50:13.220 --> 50:16.200
You think you get joy by acquisition; you do not.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.230
But through Kundalini awakening you get that joy,

50:23.050 --> 50:27.140
and in that joy you don't want anything,

50:29.050 --> 50:30.140
you don't ask for anything;

50:30.190 --> 50:32.090
you just enjoy yourself;

50:32.120 --> 50:35.110
you are the property of enjoyment.

50:36.190 --> 50:39.230
Sanskrit they say,  “Atmanyeva atmane ahrushta”

50:40.080 --> 50:44.140
- “The Spirit is satisfied by its own spirit.”

50:48.080 --> 50:52.110
So into small things you must see joy,

50:53.090 --> 50:58.090
and you must watch it, the whole universe, with that thing.

50:59.010 --> 51:01.020
I mean when I am traveling I'll ask,

51:01.050 --> 51:02.130
“What is this tree?”

51:02.160 --> 51:03.210
“Mother, we don't know.”

51:03.230 --> 51:05.190
“Well, you lived here for so many years, you don't know?”

51:05.210 --> 51:07.210
“No Mother, we don't know much about trees.”

51:07.240 --> 51:09.040
I say, “What are these flowers?”

51:09.070 --> 51:10.120
“We don't know.”

51:11.040 --> 51:13.070
I mean what are you doing, what have you been doing,

51:13.090 --> 51:14.070
you don't know what are the trees,

51:14.100 --> 51:15.210
every day you watch them;

51:15.240 --> 51:18.120
you don't know what is the tree is?

51:21.130 --> 51:24.060
But if you ask them, “Where do you get this wine?”

51:24.100 --> 51:25.210
they will know.

51:25.210 --> 51:27.030
“Mother, this is the place

51:27.070 --> 51:29.020
where they produced the best wines.”

51:29.030 --> 51:30.180
“All right, I'll see to it.”

51:30.220 --> 51:34.110
And next year they had no fermentation.

51:39.130 --> 51:43.240
So, this is the acquisition instinct which is very,

51:44.020 --> 51:47.220
sort of a, which becomes a political asset

51:48.020 --> 51:49.210
that you go and aggress other countries,

51:49.240 --> 51:54.100
aggress other people and use all kinds of things;

51:57.080 --> 52:00.140
and that really is killing.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.070
So the whole attitude of human beings changes,

52:05.110 --> 52:06.240
they think we are the Lord,

52:07.020 --> 52:08.110
we can hate anyone,

52:08.180 --> 52:10.020
we can aggress anyone,

52:10.050 --> 52:11.190
we could be arrogant with anyone,

52:11.240 --> 52:15.020
we can demand anything, we can take away anybody's wife,

52:15.070 --> 52:17.240
take away anybody's child, take away anything,

52:18.020 --> 52:20.000
we can kill our children.

52:21.150 --> 52:26.130
As a result the love is lost;

52:26.210 --> 52:29.210
no question of compassion.

52:30.050 --> 52:33.160
Love is lost, compassion is lost; no love.

52:36.210 --> 52:40.110
And with that you also developed “my” and “mine”,

52:40.130 --> 52:42.130
sense of “my and mine”

52:43.160 --> 52:46.040
- is that this is my child,

52:47.020 --> 52:49.040
this is my country,

52:50.000 --> 52:54.150
this is... As you know in Yugoslavia what they are doing.

52:54.180 --> 52:58.240
I don't know who gave the name of Yugo, Yugo means Yoga.

52:59.050 --> 53:03.110
This is the Yoga people, fighting among themselves.

53:03.210 --> 53:08.160
This has come from the same root that,

53:08.190 --> 53:10.150
“This is mine, this is my country”.

53:10.180 --> 53:13.020
Why? How is it your country?

53:13.080 --> 53:16.100
You can't create one leaf, so who are you?

53:16.130 --> 53:20.240
You can't create little mud, can you?

53:22.240 --> 53:26.090
How do you say, “This is my country?” How dare?

53:26.100 --> 53:28.210
This all belongs to God.

53:29.030 --> 53:32.150
He has created, or you can say Adi Shakti has created.

53:33.060 --> 53:35.200
You have not created even so much;

53:35.240 --> 53:39.070
how do you say, “This is mine and I should have it?”

53:39.140 --> 53:44.230
So the “my” and “mine” thing also develops, very strong.

53:45.060 --> 53:48.030
And the same thing happens with, sometimes, Sahaja Yogis,

53:48.070 --> 53:53.070
very much. “My children”, this is the first curse.

53:55.070 --> 54:01.030
“These are my children, my wife, my family”,

54:02.140 --> 54:05.040
it starts growing like that.

54:07.060 --> 54:10.200
Then the heart shrinks.

54:11.180 --> 54:15.210
For a large-hearted man the whole world is the universe,

54:16.030 --> 54:19.150
the whole thing is within,

54:19.180 --> 54:22.000
the whole thing is yours.

54:24.190 --> 54:29.160
When such a heart you experience within yourself

54:29.210 --> 54:31.240
then Kundalini just shoots off because,

54:32.020 --> 54:34.230
as you know, the Sahasrara is the Heart Chakra.

54:35.210 --> 54:38.190
No question of Sahasrara catching

54:39.070 --> 54:41.120
if you have a large heart.

54:42.050 --> 54:44.230
And to keep the Sahasrara open

54:45.040 --> 54:50.020
- is just develop that sense, that wisdom,

54:50.070 --> 54:53.100
that: "Nobody's mine, everybody belongs to God.

54:53.130 --> 54:55.130
Who is mine?

54:57.050 --> 54:59.160
Whatever God wants, let Him do."

54:59.230 --> 55:03.150
So get out of this small feeling.

55:03.180 --> 55:07.020
Sahaja Yogis do, I must say, I have seen it.

55:07.080 --> 55:10.160
They get confined to their families.

55:12.070 --> 55:14.020
“My son hasn't got Realization,

55:14.070 --> 55:16.150
my brother hasn't got Realization, my this thing.”

55:17.180 --> 55:21.040
After that it moves, when they get Realization,

55:21.070 --> 55:24.040
“This is my son, my brother, my sister, this thing.”

55:24.080 --> 55:28.020
This “my” has to drop, which is very, very subtle thing,

55:28.050 --> 55:30.160
and that's why the Sahasrara catches.

55:31.130 --> 55:34.040
Everyone is yours

55:36.170 --> 55:44.230
because the Kundalini of Sahaja Yogis is made of love,

55:46.090 --> 55:48.090
pure love.

55:48.230 --> 55:53.010
The pure love has only pure desire, is to love,

55:53.150 --> 55:56.180
love everyone equally.

55:58.060 --> 55:59.180
When you say it is difficult

55:59.210 --> 56:02.010
that means you are not trying Sahaja Yoga.

56:02.210 --> 56:04.180
Enlarge your heart;

56:04.230 --> 56:06.210
you'll never feel lost.

56:07.030 --> 56:11.200
To Me, when I was leaving England I was really, little bit,

56:11.240 --> 56:16.040
I mean happens like that, like a moon sucks in the sea,

56:16.090 --> 56:20.070
you see, I felt My heart was just pulled out,

56:20.210 --> 56:26.040
but I reach here, again I see My children waiting for Me,

56:27.060 --> 56:29.180
so it's over, finished.

56:30.010 --> 56:33.180
It's there I felt, now here I feel

56:34.130 --> 56:40.060
that pull of My heart was released.

56:42.060 --> 56:46.040
You are also My children here and they are also My children.

56:46.090 --> 56:48.180
For a Mother like this, how can I say,

56:48.230 --> 56:51.150
“Oh, say this is Mine, this is Mine?”

56:53.090 --> 56:58.180
So like this, try to break away from this conditioning.

56:58.210 --> 57:01.180
First, in the West people don't care for family;

57:01.210 --> 57:04.150
they'll divorce ten times and advertise it,

57:04.180 --> 57:07.070
“I am tenth time divorced lady."

57:08.010 --> 57:11.180
Now they don't divorce but so get attached

57:12.230 --> 57:15.170
with their family, with their husbands;

57:15.210 --> 57:18.090
like glue I tell you, like glue.

57:19.070 --> 57:20.180
Sometimes I start wondering,

57:20.230 --> 57:24.040
“What have I done to make them like this?”

57:25.210 --> 57:29.090
So now it is important to see these points,

57:29.140 --> 57:34.210
and ultimately the heart is the Sahasrara,

57:35.010 --> 57:36.230
or you can call the Brahmarandra,

57:37.030 --> 57:40.100
then we have to come to heart.

57:40.150 --> 57:44.100
Do not reason out, do not argue it out,

57:45.010 --> 57:49.060
don't work it out mentally from books or anywhere,

57:49.100 --> 57:51.010
but through your heart,

57:51.060 --> 57:52.100
if you work it out,

57:52.140 --> 57:56.140
you'll understand that nothing is more important

57:57.090 --> 58:00.030
than to love someone.

58:01.010 --> 58:06.170
And the highest thing is to love everyone equally.

58:07.010 --> 58:10.090
Of course in love you might have to say something

58:10.140 --> 58:12.070
to a person.

58:13.010 --> 58:15.230
The other day I had to say something to some Sahaja Yogini,

58:16.070 --> 58:17.020
so My husband said,

58:17.070 --> 58:18.230
“Don't say, she'll become Your enemy.”

58:19.010 --> 58:20.210
I said, “Let her become My enemy, it doesn't matter.

58:21.010 --> 58:24.040
It's My duty to tell her that this is wrong,

58:24.190 --> 58:28.010
otherwise I become her enemy because I don't… told her

58:29.080 --> 58:31.130
the truth and she will suffer.”

58:34.110 --> 58:37.130
So this is what it gives you discretion;

58:37.220 --> 58:41.070
and love is truth.

58:42.150 --> 58:45.020
So to this Kundalini,

58:45.110 --> 58:51.080
which is nothing but, is the river,

58:51.160 --> 58:54.080
as yesterday they described nirvaj,

58:55.110 --> 58:59.190
which doesn't accept any compensation.

59:00.020 --> 59:03.210
The river of that pure love

59:04.040 --> 59:06.100
which has awakened us with such love,

59:06.150 --> 59:08.130
kindness and tenderness,

59:08.180 --> 59:14.050
we should try to use that power within ourselves

59:14.110 --> 59:17.160
to be like that because our job is,

59:17.220 --> 59:20.070
She has given us Realization

59:20.130 --> 59:23.210
for the emancipation of the whole world,

59:23.240 --> 59:25.100
not only our own.

59:25.150 --> 59:29.100
So everyone has to give Realization to others

59:29.150 --> 59:32.130
otherwise their Kundalini will settle back.

59:33.080 --> 59:37.140
Talk about Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is not part time,

59:38.050 --> 59:41.130
it is not a side issue, it should be always with you.

59:41.120 --> 59:43.110
Wherever you get a chance you have to talk

59:43.140 --> 59:45.120
about Sahaja Yoga, you have to work it out,

59:45.170 --> 59:49.170
you have to give Realization, otherwise no use.

59:50.230 --> 59:53.090
May God bless you all.
