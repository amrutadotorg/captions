WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Citizens of Ahmedngar sent invitation to me with the love.

00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:12.650
We all are very thankful to all of you for that.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.324
in that also

00:00:19.043 --> 00:00:22.019
ahmednagar district is very special for me.

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.542
Because the work started and spreading at rahuri.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.589
from that, we get to know that some special spritual work done in the past in this district.

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:42.225
Also maharahtra is one of, spiritual land.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.506
So that many saints took their birth here and did lot of work.

00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:57.055
Atlast I want to tell you, we know that sai nath did beautiful work in ahmednagar.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:03.754
All this preparation done in human from ancient days.

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:09.950
Human grown up from ameoba and today he reached to this direction

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:12.856
That today he is thinking about god.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.294
why he is grown from ameoba to this state?

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:23.162
Why all these efforts were taken on him?

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:29.803
Today, after he came to human state, he is completed or not?

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:35.612
For which he is leave the human condition from the amoeba

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:42.964
After coming to that state he knows everything.

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:49.040
curiosity about the god in him

00:01:49.552 --> 00:01:58.431
There is some curiosity and eagerness. And every human being think that there some power is present in the universe named god almighty.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.769
How he know this and from where he get know about this  power?

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:07.711
He wrote many books about that.

00:02:08.202 --> 00:02:11.641
Worshipped saints and also troubled them.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.115
human being like this has some meaning

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.240
Proably no one took this much efforts unnecessary. atleast god cant do this.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:36.157
If imagine that we made this instrument, first we made foundation then we did all arrangement for the instrument

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:42.230
Then you will easily ask mataji what is this and for whom and what will happen to it?

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.644
All this should do and all this preparation should do.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.722
And after every preparation is done.

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:56.755
When we connect it to mains.Then it will execute.

00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:01.896
So is human. God created man for this purpose.

00:03:02.607 --> 00:03:06.232
That too is a great instrument of god.

00:03:06.388 --> 00:03:13.197
Not only this but he created such abeautiful instrument that this instrument knows what is  God.

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:18.408
He(shri mataji talkin about mike) dont know still I am speaking from this. Who made this (the mike) he also dont know.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.340
Awareness (Chetana) is not present in this (mike). But god first given this Awareness to the human being.

00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:32.086
And then after enlighten this awareness, he can get to know that why god was created me.

00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:36.329
And then his energy will start flowing from his hands incessantly.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.712
And that energy is nothing but this pulsation.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.157
Now it is very easy to say. As Mr.chavan said is true that this will happen in a second.

00:03:49.517 --> 00:03:53.532
Really only in a second, If we want to say in English 'split of a second'.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.786
This incidence should happen easily. Because such an important incident and it is last incident in evolution.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.848
We take breath, and sleep after thinking and doing therapy.

00:04:07.052 --> 00:04:10.669
If we correct these thing, then half people may destroy.

00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:15.184
as much as anything impotant in ourself are 'sahaj'.

00:04:15.552 --> 00:04:18.452
'Sahaj' 'Saha' means with and 'j' means born.

00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:27.484
'sahaj' means the thing which is born with us. or our birthright is only yoga.

00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:32.914
So in the end, what we are must happen, what must happen.

00:04:36.032 --> 00:04:39.344
I often say many people that some things are good only if you not work hard at them.

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:41.977
they get surprised, that how shri could say like this.

00:04:42.922 --> 00:04:46.203
But can we call the god by doing hard work?

00:04:46.758 --> 00:04:57.092
If a drop of water say that, "I will do hard work and call the ocean." then it is impossible. the ocean must descend to take the drop within itself.

00:04:57.693 --> 00:05:07.106
It is so. if we say, we do hard work, stand on head or we will do some running then they will not find god.

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:16.715
God will not find by these Efforts. ut if you are stable, religious. and you are on the middle path, and not very much in anything

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:20.699
This incident should happen easily to such people.

00:05:23.494 --> 00:05:28.322
Like a tree bearing a fruit, first only single fruit will bear when tree is small.

00:05:28.596 --> 00:05:36.395
After 2-3 more fruits will come on the tree but atlast tree will Bloom and many flowers became fruit.

00:05:36.591 --> 00:05:44.067
And today is a special time. this was supposed to happen in kaliyuga, and it happening, and it will happen.

00:05:47.177 --> 00:05:51.668
I cant understand, why is there so much excitment about it?

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:58.793
I really surprised, when people say why like this, like that?

00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:04.637
If I say, here is a diamond. will you think? First you will go and ring the diamond, right.

00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:13.973
If I say, everything that is acquired by birth. it will receive you today by sahajyoga. then why you are confused?

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.949
Many incarnation came in the world to make the this event happen.they were prepared you for this event.

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:29.473
How it was done? I will show you here , seeit and try to understand it.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:34.785
What do you see as an external body, is by means of what?

00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:41.285
If we ask doctors, What is parasympathetic nervous system?

00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:43.669
Then, they will say it is autonomous nervous system.

00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.763
It means self driven but who is the self?

00:06:47.576 --> 00:06:50.771
We dont know about that.(doctors will say this). Atleast they are honest about this.

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:55.286
(Doctors say) We dont know how it wil run, how it will work out.

00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:59.614
Means, after we ate food, Who digest our food?

00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:05.903
How do we keep our breathing going so smoothly?

00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:11.146
In that also If you run then heart processing will increase.

00:07:11.677 --> 00:07:17.091
And then start pulpitation, you can do that. but who will slow down that?

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:25.739
If you ask to the doctors, Who will do this action? then the doctors will say, "we cannot tell that because it is beyond our science".

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:42.599
Same like that, In psychology also so many people did experiments and they proved, there is an energy which omnipresent.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:49.092
They called this energy as Universal unconscious. And she comes to you in your dreams and guides you.

00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:55.123
And guidance would come in the form of symbols.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.810
If we can see the one type triangle then it can be seen same from here and australia and also for america the meaning will be same.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.369
But they also tell same thing after reached at one state that we cannot tell anything about this.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:16.080
We can see only outer part but internally how it looks and how it working, we cannot see that.

00:08:17.518 --> 00:08:28.026
Our india is very big country. We should proud that really it is a ig country because it is a yogbhumi.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:37.491
The people from this place have never paid much attention to wordly or material things.

00:08:37.874 --> 00:08:45.920
They always think about,
 why human being came in to this world?
how he came? from where he came? What is the meaning of him?

00:08:47.037 --> 00:08:53.530
And by working hard and meditating your ancestors earned this and they found this.

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:59.170
Only the difference is, it was not executed,and today it executing by our hands.

00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:04.264
For example today we can see the electricity, this electricity has big history.

00:09:04.522 --> 00:09:09.639
After working very hard for the several years on this then some one can find out that electricity can be produced in this way.

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:18.178
After finding about electricity if that person stored it himself only, then today can you believe that edison and newton was the big personalities.

00:09:18.483 --> 00:09:28.920
Common people should get Every exploration of physical things. In the same way this Spiritual exploration also everyone should get. otherwise no one will believe.

00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:40.841
In the same way, We learned Humans are eavluated from ameobs and it is true.

00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:49.252
But every ameoba was not changed Human, Every Fish was not become Reptile and every reptiple was not transformed to its higher state.

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.273
In that also selection will be there.

00:09:51.797 --> 00:09:55.425
Because of that selection we get evolution of human state.

00:09:55.496 --> 00:10:06.770
 If there is any next stage in this evolution where we have to reach, and so many people talked about that stage. Then there is also selection should be done.

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:12.489
And this selection is happen. If 10 people come in sahajyoga then may be 2 people will not get seleted.

00:10:12.609 --> 00:10:23.137
Now we were in kovullem, there Government of india organized our program. That means first time government of india has some maturity because they arranged our program in kovullem.

00:10:23.184 --> 00:10:33.410
And There.... News reporters were arrived. Now News reporters means we all know what quality they are. some reporters are very strange.

00:10:33.473 --> 00:10:40.168
And as soon as they arrived, they told us, "give us alchohol, otherwise we will not attend any event.Our fees decided." etc.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:47.254
When they started doing this, I told them directly, "You dont print anything about me. Just get out from here. We want dont want anything from you."

00:10:47.358 --> 00:10:55.903
Then they all are angry on that. And they printed Wrong information about sahajyoga. But in that also I gave realization to some of them.

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:58.730
Due that some people wrote good about sahajyoga and some people wrote wrong information.

00:10:58.918 --> 00:11:07.625
whatever you write good or bad but truth cannot push back. because Truth stand on Truth only.

00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:15.594
If you did mistake because your pettieness and stupidity then also Truth is Truth only.

00:11:15.878 --> 00:11:20.831
When Out of ten people eight people will get realization then this is Reality and it should be done.

00:11:21.636 --> 00:11:25.245
And we can see the proof for that in different terms.

00:11:25.495 --> 00:11:31.503
First I will tell about, What is the Kundalini? and how we can get the proof for that also I will tell you.

00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:34.794
Now, Everyone can see this?

00:11:40.038 --> 00:11:48.810
Now You all are listening to me. Whatever I speak it will come in to your mind. and all this went and sit here.

00:11:48.936 --> 00:11:58.435
In this way This left side is known as Ida nadi also this is known as chandra nadi nd in Hath yogaitis known as THA nadi.

00:11:59.498 --> 00:12:04.661
This is that power of god because which our existance made.

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:11.935
If you believe this , then I will say it is the power of lord shiva.

00:12:12.451 --> 00:12:18.169
This is the power of lord shiva and in sanskrit language we can call this power of mahakali.

00:12:18.408 --> 00:12:23.115
This is the power of mahakali now doctors will say that mahakali is not present at our place.

00:12:23.174 --> 00:12:30.924
But our sanskrit language was written thousand years before english language. and these things were found thousand before sanskrit language.

00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:35.292
Thats why English people not that much capable to treat us

00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:45.792
(claping sound)......Because of the Ida nadi from our left side our Existence started.

00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:53.628
Our existence depend on this( ida nadi). and when we dont have an existence we will get destroyed thats why so many people called it as destroying power.

00:12:54.886 --> 00:13:02.307
And after going upward this right side energy will go to left side and left side energy will go to right side.

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:11.463
Now using this right side energy we do physical work.

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:16.760
And because of this (right side)state we do intellectual work.

00:13:16.894 --> 00:13:24.426
That means future plans, what we can say that we have to organize this, or we have to make it proper.

00:13:24.489 --> 00:13:38.758
Or else womens also think that tommorrow we have to pickles or crackers, etc. like all the other things which include future planning, all are done with this( right side energy) power.

00:13:39.095 --> 00:13:51.465
Also all the physical works, for example if we decide to go for running tommorrow , this can done from this energy (right side).

00:13:51.604 --> 00:13:58.221
We can called it as mental and physiacal existence or whatever other work, we can use it for that.

00:13:58.503 --> 00:14:05.627
Now the energy at the centre is known as 'sushumna'. This energy flows in to the 'sushumna nadi'.

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:12.963
We saw the workforce of the god, obviously it works from pingala nadi.

00:14:13.088 --> 00:14:21.065
And because of the sushumna nadi placed at the centre, our evolution done. because that only religion established within us.

00:14:21.253 --> 00:14:31.237
Now, carbon has 4 valencies. If any chemistry professiors among us they know in periodic laws everything is fixed perfectly.

00:14:31.378 --> 00:14:36.799
We get surprised how each element is fixed perfectly.

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:43.096
 carbon have 4 valaencies or gold color never destroy it is the religion of gold.

00:14:43.252 --> 00:14:47.096
Likewise human being Dharma is also made from the sushumna channel.

00:14:47.197 --> 00:14:52.962
First dharma will made and then evolution of dharma will be done. By changing and changing the dharma eveolution will take place.

00:14:53.096 --> 00:14:59.008
Their difference between our dharma and gold dharma. and Their is difference between our dharma and animal dharma.

00:14:59.135 --> 00:15:04.055
But now after human dharm is done, what is next step of that?

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:14.418
This is beyond religion and beyond quality. that means the three qualities just now I told you they are,  Tamogun, Rajogun, sattvagun.

00:15:14.612 --> 00:15:19.714
We go beyond the qualities after coming to human vagina.

00:15:19.894 --> 00:15:26.339
That means now human come at this point where he just want to know his meaning.

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:37.385
He should connect with his omnipresent energy, and for that which energy is present within us is known 'KUNDALINI'.

00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:41.033
This kundalini sitted in three and half coils in that.

00:15:41.163 --> 00:15:52.413
but it is like tape, in tape records and what is their in our past like our good deeds and also our bad deeds whatever we deed all is present in that.

00:15:52.632 --> 00:15:57.952
Not only about this life also about many lifes records are there in the kundalini.

00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:01.569
This kindalini situated within us below here.

00:16:03.011 --> 00:16:15.078
Likewise their is a plant in his seeds in the same way in human being this seed or your mother take irths with you in your every life.

00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:21.242
And she is waiting for that time when this work will happen and you will get rebirth.

00:16:21.774 --> 00:16:32.250
In ancient days 1 or 2 people get realized. We know that, we have not heard many people will become saint at a time or they get realized.

00:16:32.577 --> 00:16:39.414
people have knowledge that means we read 'dnyaneshawari' and 'geeta'. but very few people get realization.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.750
And thats why too much scams get disclosed.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:50.836
if we want to follow any religion or any spiritual practice, first our connection should be done with the spirit.

00:16:51.676 --> 00:16:54.776
But it is very strange that people dont know about this small thing also.

00:16:55.286 --> 00:17:02.780
If you dont know about spirit and if you will get connected to spirit then cannot know anything about god.

00:17:03.187 --> 00:17:13.874
Likewise, I must have eyes to see this beautiful hall, In the same if until the eyes of your spirit become open you cannot coonect with the god.

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:20.342
That why today all religions get the wind.

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:25.866
Useless people took advantage of this.

00:17:26.764 --> 00:17:37.233
They peole took us to the different path and today this situation arrived, not only in our country but youth in each and every country not ready to believe in god.

00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:48.217
We know about the Algeria country , where musalman people living and they too much bigot, more than us.

00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:53.889
And because this bogotry, their kids who are doctors and engineers.

00:17:53.967 --> 00:18:04.026
they are telling that ," we dont want these foolish things, you people can waste your time in this foolish things, you do 5 times NAMAJ, or you go to KABA. but we are ready to fall in these things.this is too much for us."

00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:12.214
At the same time one boy came to me in london. and I gave him realization.after giving realization I explained everything to him.

00:18:12.363 --> 00:18:17.089
What is DHARMA? Who was the mohammad? how they help us in our evolution?

00:18:17.114 --> 00:18:22.690
After that who is khrist? and beyond this what is the meaning of inacarnation of Shri ram and shri krishn?

00:18:22.816 --> 00:18:36.032
And after that when he went back to his country, then he gathered all these boys and told them,"God is present there and omnipresent energy will be there, but these people dont know their own sprit  thats why they are doing everything blindlessly. But we can see that."

00:18:36.251 --> 00:18:41.727
And he gave realization to 500 people. and in this way our sahajyoga started on time.

00:18:41.808 --> 00:18:49.188
When that people left the Dharma and become superstitius. at that time our sahajyoga is at the centre. where you will get actual proof of the god.

00:18:50.532 --> 00:18:58.320
Now this kundalini is situated here is also told by saint dyaneshwar maharaj. also most of work done by shri markandeya swami.

00:18:58.368 --> 00:19:05.657
And also Adishankaracharya did very big work. he explained everything very beautiful, clear and in deep manner.

00:19:05.712 --> 00:19:09.438
But I am getting surprised because no one will read the books of aadishankaracharya.

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:17.133
Not only this, But when I went to kovullem at that time he was living in kerala and his life he spent in kaleri village from kerala.

00:19:17.337 --> 00:19:23.852
And I get surprised when people from that are place are telling that, we dont know, about aadishankaracharya.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:29.204
Because of the English education system people have this much ignorance.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.805
To see the benefits of english education system, you can go to england and see that.

00:19:34.098 --> 00:19:40.392
And we forgot our all things because we are became secular state. means..

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:46.306
If total ignorance of dharma is the sign of secular state, then it(secularism) spread among us.

00:19:46.443 --> 00:19:53.875
In our country Dharma estalished by very intense study and meditation.and sign for that given.

00:19:54.041 --> 00:20:03.017
We can rule over whole world by the truth of the Dharma, we can do love regain.

00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:11.694
And also we know that, there is curiosity about our country in the whole world.

00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:18.415
We know that many people are coming to our country to see the work of truth.

00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:28.201
We made imposters for them(foreigners) also. and they are robbing them.and they will never enter in to the trustworthy places.

00:20:28.383 --> 00:20:57.188
The day before yesterday we take them to musalwadi then our followers are telling me that, "shri mataji only beacuse of the blessing of sahajyoga only we have harmony among us. we came to india so many times, but we cannot speak to indians, and if we spoke then only the people who are adapted western culture and who can talk englishbetter than kembridge, thats why we were fraustrated with this country."

00:20:57.317 --> 00:21:08.571
And today these people really surprised by seeing your culture and your meditation. and the feel that, they should bow down at you feet.

00:21:08.668 --> 00:21:15.316
By seeing this love celebration also the get surprised, and they thought that we forgot everything in that english education.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:24.191
Their love and numness of their heart or devotion and belief whatever is their all get vanished. that should not happen here.

00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:36.403
But it is happening and it is really very sad thing. before independance we were stick to our culture but as soon as we get freedom we think that we are free now thats why we can bahave as we want.But it will not happen.

00:21:36.598 --> 00:21:42.669
Because if human cannot attent this state(realization) then should he go to animal state? this is the question in my mind.

00:21:42.857 --> 00:21:50.075
May be he will go to devil state. beacuse next stage  is to be superhuman then how he can go to animal state.

00:21:50.537 --> 00:21:55.357
And if they went to animal state then they will go to that animals who are not human as well as not animal.

00:21:55.974 --> 00:22:05.505
This evolution state is totally happened within us. and different stages are made of that evolution.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:15.927
In first step the very first chakra,situated within us we can see here at the bottom in square shape is muladhar chakr.

00:22:15.973 --> 00:22:20.312
Now in this also many people take their own imagination.

00:22:20.373 --> 00:22:25.870
In india there no lack of imagination. any one start taking on spirituality.

00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:31.451
Because no one can catch them. there is no proof for that. Who saw that he is the teacher.

00:22:31.487 --> 00:22:40.646
Who saw that they start taking lectures and lectures on that and thousands of people sitting for the lecture and I dont know what he talks and what people listen and what is the use of that.

00:22:40.697 --> 00:22:49.068
Only the thing is you should see how much money you had before attending lecture and how much left behind after lecture. apart from this you will not get anything.

00:22:49.897 --> 00:22:58.115
On this chakra which is known as Muladhar chakra, god shri ganesha placed by almighty god.

00:22:58.881 --> 00:23:03.045
But now, the question is there is ganapati present in our scripture or not?

00:23:03.162 --> 00:23:10.838
Some doctors put the ganapati photoraph in the home  ut if I say some diseses will cure by parying shri ganesha then they will get surprised. they thought how is it possible?

00:23:10.863 --> 00:23:21.667
They all know some materialistic and mediacal things. but if shri mataji says, because of shri ganesha some diseases will cure means what, is it true? ut it will happen.

00:23:22.371 --> 00:23:31.136
But you must have authority. What is the relation established between you and shri ganesha? Nothing, if you put one photograph at a corner means that is not worshipping of shri ganesha.

00:23:31.288 --> 00:23:33.537
Just talking about shri ganesha means not worshipping shri ganesha.

00:23:33.697 --> 00:23:43.006
But what is shri ganhesha? and how to know about shri ganesha? till you learn about that. till you get the authorityfrom god to know about shri ganesha.

00:23:43.302 --> 00:23:50.231
Till then you cannot know,why almighty god put this shri ganesha within us?

00:23:50.536 --> 00:23:58.832
Now shri ganesha is the sign of purity. God made purity in this world and put ganpati as a god of purity.

00:23:58.962 --> 00:24:06.930
We will get surprised, and no one will believe in this kaliyuga that god created first purity in this world.

00:24:07.095 --> 00:24:18.644
And after that, because God is the father and also ocean of kindness and ocean of love. Not only this but he is also full of compassion.

00:24:19.116 --> 00:24:32.107
He thought that, if my children should get supreme happiness. then first I should put very precious thing. and thats why he put Purity first.

00:24:32.639 --> 00:24:39.099
Same purity is present within us by shri ganesha.

00:24:40.373 --> 00:24:47.396
Now If I want to talk about shri ganesha then I have to give one lecture and it is too big. thats why we will just bow down to him and we will go next.

00:24:47.513 --> 00:24:53.725
above that(muladhar) chakra is swadhishtan chakra this is also placed within us by God.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:25:00.668
We do any work with this chakra. for example art, thinking

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:07.238
after that,Whatever creative power present in the world is used by swadhishtan chakra.

00:25:07.387 --> 00:25:20.742
Now because of swadhishtan chakra within us, we do art work or we think about future or we do planning etc. all stress of these work is on this (swadhishtan) chakra.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:30.534
We thought that, we think using our brain. that is correct but from where does the fat present in brain comes?

00:25:30.661 --> 00:25:35.628
In our stomach, swadhishtan chakra make this fat and provide it to the brain.

00:25:35.993 --> 00:25:44.241
Now, who is overthinking person and always do planning, he will become diabetic.

00:25:45.087 --> 00:25:51.674
What is the reason? beacuse of overthinking, this person give stress to that(swadhishtan) chakra.

00:25:51.776 --> 00:26:03.749
And the second work of that chakra is take care of our splean, pancreas, kidney,utreus.

00:26:04.138 --> 00:26:15.797
Now the chakra having two works and if you give load of single work only then there will be imbalance and you will have diabetice.

00:26:15.995 --> 00:26:27.434
A village person will not have diabetice, but white collor people will motly get diabetice because they always think.

00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:37.936
Now,planning also. If we understood planning of god rather than planning of a humans, then he will not have to take these efforts, to sit and do planning.

00:26:38.108 --> 00:26:43.467
First you should understand God, the omnipresent energy of the god do all planning by herself.

00:26:43.609 --> 00:26:49.225
So if you understand his planning, then your all work will beautiful and perfect.

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:57.625
Instead of that, if you will do planning, then their is options on your resolution. and because options we can see the result of planning of our country.

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:05.624
So, If I will say that, humans cant do,anything.God will do everything. then people mataji say something.

00:27:05.821 --> 00:27:08.679
But we are not a single living work.

00:27:08.876 --> 00:27:15.317
We will get surprised, What are the work we are doing? now their is dead stones, we brought it, and put here and layed tiles.

00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:19.883
Trees are dead and we made gallaries from that and we are saying we deed very great work.

00:27:21.094 --> 00:27:26.203
Can we do a single living work? can sprout a single seed?

00:27:27.843 --> 00:27:36.382
Can we make a seed? then why we are speaking boastful that we do this, we do that? you are not doing anything.

00:27:36.783 --> 00:27:42.335
Everything is dead work. put this here or there. what is the special difference in that?

00:27:42.749 --> 00:27:50.784
This is useless work, Infact because of doing this work again and again humans become slaves of material things.

00:27:51.052 --> 00:27:58.112
Now for example, who can sit in the chair only for example our foreigners get in troule some times because they had habbit of sitting on chair so that they cant sit on the floor.

00:27:59.035 --> 00:28:06.462
Now people sitting on chair are sitting on head ...(laughing sound)... So I said, "you all walk around in our village with the chairs." I dont understand what will happen to you.

00:28:06.588 --> 00:28:12.783
Left sitting on the floor. Each and every habbit like this  so that our materialism will increase and it will sit on our head.

00:28:12.869 --> 00:28:19.283
It' s meaning not that you should take renunciation of the world. you shuld not take another meaning. when I tell this people will go to become asceticism.

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:28.525
No need to take renunciation. you should get married. Marriage system is made by god only. You should take care of your childrens but you should live with sanctity.

00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:36.041
In our sahaj,arrangements are done for common people.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:43.541
We cant give realization to ancestors. If someone came to us in Ancestors dress, then we will tell them go and wear normal cloths and then come to me.

00:28:43.624 --> 00:28:50.236
There is no need to go here and their by sticking this advertisements....(laughing sound)

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:59.191
Renunciation is done in ourself only. and by sticking these advertisemnets and speaking boastful is the sign of monkey.

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:05.809
Humans should not go with this fullish things. is is really wrong.

00:29:06.093 --> 00:29:11.941
Like this only, Many gurus also their. who surfing here and their being ancestors and thelling that we are very big gurus.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.787
We have to put these people out of the village border.

00:29:15.131 --> 00:29:24.326
Seeta said in valmiki ramayana, that if any ancestor come at the doorstep then we have to put him out of the village border. only one day we have to put him their second day we have to tell him get out.

00:29:24.428 --> 00:29:29.748
We are gentleman people. what is the relation between us. you are ancestors go and sit in the forest. what is the need to come here.

00:29:29.904 --> 00:29:38.453
That means how to live on anothers money. this paracetic life. and no place for that, in our sahjyoga.

00:29:38.535 --> 00:29:44.384
If yo anyone from you an ancestor then our salute to you, we cant do anything for you.

00:29:44.541 --> 00:29:57.935
If you get married like common people, that means batchlors also have chance....(laughing sound). our sahjyoga is only for them.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:05.149
Because these people are balanced. they have parents, childrens in their house so he has limitations. he do something in proper way.

00:30:05.204 --> 00:30:13.677
Who dont have parents, came from any orphanage. or who dont know what is limitations.

00:30:13.702 --> 00:30:19.341
How he will get realization? because of limitations only human get binded.and because of that only he will get success.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:26.970
You saw that same for trees also. When seeds start sprouting then we have to put limitations, we have to tke care of that.

00:30:27.072 --> 00:30:35.343
Now a days pschological system also tell that, whrever family systems are disturbed there childrens will become useless.

00:30:35.464 --> 00:30:44.777
And also in this world reason behind all the wars is their families get disturbed. their houses broken.

00:30:44.888 --> 00:30:51.450
They dont have parents. they surfing like orphans and thats why all these thing happened. this is the conclusion from psychological system.

00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:59.559
So, the second chakra which is called as swadhishtan chakra. here Shri brahmdev and his energy Shri sarswati devi present.

00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:07.052
But the kundalini shakti is virgin gauri shakti, we all know, how gauri made shri ganesha.

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:14.849
And how she told him to stay outside the door. from this we get to know that ganesha sees the sanctity of gauri.

00:31:15.108 --> 00:31:24.044
In english it is called as protocol. he(ganesha) dont have any role in kundalini intersection.

00:31:24.168 --> 00:31:30.840
He dont have an intersection, he just sit their and raise this. now the people who attack on shri ganesha.

00:31:32.521 --> 00:31:41.465
Shri ganesha in which chakra, the pelvik plexes run by that.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:48.848
Though in subtle system it is known as muladhar chakra but it is run by pelvik plexes.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:53.098
And sex also balanced by this pelvik plexes.

00:31:53.223 --> 00:32:01.816
Small child dont know about sex. thats why a small boy who always will be small, the shri ganesha situated there.

00:32:01.981 --> 00:32:11.550
Now the dirty people, In your pune also one gentleman is there.who taught dirty thing that, if you want to awake kundalini you to do it by these dirty ways.

00:32:11.603 --> 00:32:18.325
So we have to bring to notice them. But after this also they will aware of this. they dont have  mother and sister.

00:32:18.373 --> 00:32:35.199
But when shri ganesha sat their to protocol your mother kundalini. and then also if we are telling this dirty things then we are doing very dirty behaviour with our mother only. we have to notice this.

00:32:35.262 --> 00:32:47.528
Every indian hate this dirty things. and in our country many people do these things and they destroyed our country by doing these dirty things.

00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:55.856
Any person who took birth from his mother womb and she is alive then she cannot tolerate these dirty things.

00:32:55.981 --> 00:33:11.198
We have to notice that. the dirty people who talk about dirty things and keep you away from sacred.we have put them in sea or send them to other country.

00:33:11.276 --> 00:33:19.360
We dont have to listen them. but it is surprised that many indians even I heard that many  ministers also go to this dirty people.

00:33:19.447 --> 00:33:30.791
Now I am surprised, how can you elect this kind of people? In our country, if we dont know about mother and if we forget that who is the mother? then nothing will be there in this country.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:39.357
Atleast we should know, Mother is very sacred. and she gave us sanctity in our life.

00:33:39.538 --> 00:33:46.162
And we should understand who talk the dirty things about mother, how much dagerous they are for our country.

00:33:47.843 --> 00:33:53.537
Now next chakra which is situated above this(swadhishtan chakra) is called Nabhi chakra.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:59.213
It is also called as manipur chakra. and on this chakra shri Laxmi narayana sitting.We know the laxmis essence.

00:33:59.729 --> 00:34:06.932
Laxmi narayan establish dharma within us.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:18.226
Wethink that this person have laxmi, means he is very reach.But there is big difference between laxmi and money.

00:34:18.367 --> 00:34:26.641
Money not laxmi and laxmi not the money. One of the aspect of laxmi is money and luxury.But laxmi format is very different.

00:34:26.914 --> 00:34:32.476
Now,I will tell you about laxmi in short. Beacuse if we have to tell about this much chakra is really difficult.

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:39.649
We saw laxmi, her one hand is like this and second hand is like this. and lotus is present in her both the hands.

00:34:39.836 --> 00:34:45.965
That means, who is laxmipati his heart should be like lotus inpink color.

00:34:46.023 --> 00:34:52.082
That means he should have love,kindness and also in his house beauty should be there like lotus.

00:34:52.215 --> 00:34:56.559
In his heart, his behaviour, beauty should be like lotus.

00:34:56.701 --> 00:35:04.576
Likewise. a weed also go and sit in the lotus. though Lotus to prick with thorns but lotus cover it.

00:35:04.615 --> 00:35:12.365
And In the night time by covering him lotus let him sleep peacefully.

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:20.328
But laxmipati is number one angry person ,I think. So instead calling him as laxmipati we can call him only rich person (person with more money).

00:35:20.406 --> 00:35:26.800
Nowdays laxmipati not their but in our time, means when we were young like you we saw laxmipati( a person blessed with laxmi mata).

00:35:26.866 --> 00:35:37.081
You people are unlucky regarding this. you can see only rented people(conjusted mindset people). but really in our time we saw such great people.whom we can say really laxmipati.

00:35:37.173 --> 00:35:42.674
Now in second hand charity is there. there must needless charity should done by this persons hands.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:50.209
And from this hand shelter is there. we should live with this shelter. We should call them as Laxmipati.

00:35:50.302 --> 00:36:06.895
Also, laxmi is like mother. So that person heart should be like mother. Like this we had established laxmi in our country from eternity. such great country is ours.

00:36:06.976 --> 00:36:12.531
Such Ideas will come to these materialistic people mind? they are doom people. Will it e come to their minds?

00:36:12.632 --> 00:36:20.655
They cut the throat of others for single penny. This is heritage we got.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:28.023
This heritage should not leave. We should live with proud in that. though we are poor but we are very reach by heart. We should remember this.

00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:32.192
Human Will not be reach by poverty and wealth. he is reach by his heart.

00:36:32.387 --> 00:36:41.278
Now, We are wealthy at my father house. and my husband is also to reach.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:46.681
But, If you tell us to live in a hunt, we will comfortably. we can sleep onthe road also.

00:36:46.776 --> 00:36:52.346
Beacuse we are enjoying. We dont want anything. The person who dont want anything that' the real man.

00:36:53.002 --> 00:36:59.962
He is the king. otherwise who has needs he sees others with jealousy.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:09.239
So this is the very big blessing of laxmi at our nabhi chakra and we should take care of this laxmi.We should be courteous.

00:37:09.417 --> 00:37:18.137
And that courteousness is still preserved by people in our country. still they know that money is not everything beyond that dharma is very big thing.

00:37:18.246 --> 00:37:27.516
And living righteously, living righteously means not going in temple and doing parroting.

00:37:27.602 --> 00:37:35.371
And in this land of saints, many guru came and they discussed many things about, what is dharma?

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:42.024
We should be grateful to this gurus. but we not listening to anything.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:49.626
Among them 10 main gurus are their. and they came to this world many times. from them mohmmad sahb was wtness of shri Datttreya.

00:37:49.865 --> 00:38:03.523
After mohmmad sahb, nank is also incarnation of their (shri dattatreya). Janak also incarnation of them. also Adinath and all who came before mahaveera they also incarnation of them (Shri dattatreya).

00:38:03.805 --> 00:38:13.560
After that Infact, We are so lucky, mostly people from Ahmednagar because shirdi sainath who live here in shirdi, he was also incarnation of dattatreya.

00:38:13.842 --> 00:38:21.349
Only guru principle come many times in the world.and he taught many thing about balancing of dharma.

00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:27.857
They dont talk much about realization and self knowledge.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.670
The main thing they is that dont drink alchohol.

00:38:33.306 --> 00:38:38.884
May be they are silly or the people who write negative things about alchohol they are silly.

00:38:39.032 --> 00:38:47.860
Not drinking the alchohol is very scientific thing. The day before yesterday I was telling to chemistry professor about this and they should not drink alchohol.

00:38:48.165 --> 00:38:58.070
Alchohol and cancer both are the same things. the OH present in that are same for Alchohol and cancer.

00:38:58.156 --> 00:39:06.024
So in that, whatever heat created in you because of working.

00:39:06.075 --> 00:39:15.852
That cannot flow from your blood vessels. beacause it cannot abosr its water or OH. because its method will change.

00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:21.375
And thats why, different kind of heat will be collected in your stomach and liver.

00:39:21.462 --> 00:39:27.024
Now if I tell you that cancer is cured by sahajyoga only not any other thing. and we cured it.

00:39:27.087 --> 00:39:42.674
Now we cured a cancer patient in london and his wife is a very famous doctor. and she telling that you should talk about this in our mediacal college. now lets see what will happen after going there.

00:39:43.761 --> 00:39:55.368
So in that, too much heat was released from the body of that lady.In london too much cold is there but still she kept all doors open. and telling that, "too much heat coming out from my body." And everyone thought that heater is present their.

00:39:55.708 --> 00:40:06.374
Same thing happenwith alchoholic person. who drink alchohol, heat is collected in his liver and kidney. and then his blood vessels become harden.

00:40:06.796 --> 00:40:15.108
Now, they told dont drink. Now If I tell you this, then you wont listen to me.

00:40:15.218 --> 00:40:21.179
Instead of that, no one will come. The day before yesterday I told them to take oath that they will not drink thenhalf of the people left from here.

00:40:21.296 --> 00:40:28.749
I just told them to take oath. Not told to give money for that. But only telling that half people left away.

00:40:28.903 --> 00:40:36.264
Now alchohol is such harmful thing. So any mother could tell to harm yourself.Come ox and heat me.(this is common phrase used in marathi the meaning is harming self knowingly.)

00:40:36.617 --> 00:40:49.308
Money waste for that, also you saw a drunk person. actually we saw three accidents on the way. among them one drunk person was lying on road.

00:40:49.387 --> 00:40:54.996
And we this daily. But some people told me in india alchohole is increased. thats why I am surprised.

00:40:56.035 --> 00:41:03.496
So, What we are achieving sitting this thing on our head? the alchohol who is the biggest enemy of us.

00:41:05.528 --> 00:41:16.722
But still in sahajyoga we wont tell to leave anything. just now Mr. chavhan said, "shri mataji wont tell to leave anything." and that is true. But after realization you will left it.

00:41:17.793 --> 00:41:27.654
Now these people come from foreign. We made 300 people in london very beautiful.Apart from that thousands of people took realization. But these 300 people are very beatiful.

00:41:27.756 --> 00:41:32.958
Many of them were alchoholic and consume drugs. But in this everything left. But how?

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:42.318
It is like,When get to know spirit, when he enjoying inner happiness. then he dont suggest all these things. everything will left automatically.

00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:46.044
This happiness is very different. We cant suggest any other things in front of this happiness.

00:41:46.222 --> 00:41:54.784
That means, you should drink such a alchohole which will not come down and when drink that then you will forget allother things.

00:41:56.915 --> 00:42:06.195
After that , When your laxmi principle will awaken, then a big work will be done.

00:42:06.329 --> 00:42:17.346
And that is , your financial condition will improve. people will get surprised and they thought, " what mataji telling? How it is possible? our economic condition is bad and how our financial condition will improve?"

00:42:17.781 --> 00:42:25.760
But because of laxmi principle the things will associate like that, the financial condition will change.

00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:53.163
Like wise, Our students came from there, I asked them  How you can leave like this? because they dont anything. But after they come to me got their realization their conditions changed.

00:42:53.202 --> 00:43:03.900
I aksed them, How can you buy this? then they said," We left consuming alchohole that why, half of the money was spend on alchohol. Now why we want, dearness allowances? to consume alchohol.

00:43:06.588 --> 00:43:16.709
It is not like that you dont have anything to eat. but in that also, when you take alchohol you laxmi will go off.

00:43:16.968 --> 00:43:23.966
Why we will not made statues of any drunk person? because they are not in that condition.

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:34.997
And thats why, they prohibited Alchohol, cigarette and many other things. and it is very important.

00:43:35.568 --> 00:43:40.817
We cannot understand importance of awareness. it is really important for us. because it goes against awareness.

00:43:41.012 --> 00:43:53.435
The awareness from which we can understand the god. We should consider that,The thing which goes against awareness. that will how much hazardous and bad.

00:43:54.287 --> 00:44:00.857
Now the chakra above that (Nabhi) is called as heart chakra

00:44:01.834 --> 00:44:11.505
Heart chakra, because it is situated near to heart and at centre of lungs. It is very imortant because on this chakra jagdamba mata's place is their.

00:44:13.646 --> 00:44:22.975
Whenever human got scared, he will rememer to her mother. But when he get to know that your mother is mother of world.

00:44:23.117 --> 00:44:31.546
 she tremendous powerful. Whatever will happen, but she will protect you. But heard so many things about Jagdamba. Mnay devils killed by her.

00:44:31.571 --> 00:44:48.647
She did many things. Also, once she started dancing frantically then the god shankar thought, what will happen now? If Mother will disturbed and then what about her childs? And when he put a small kid below her feet then she take out her tounge. We read this. And this is true.

00:44:49.148 --> 00:45:06.446
And we can feel this in our life. When we feel insecure at that time our heart bits will increase.

00:45:07.094 --> 00:45:13.234
The reason behind incresed heart bits is our this chakra(anahat) will get confused.

00:45:13.813 --> 00:45:18.446
From there, that energy will destroy or get lost.

00:45:19.184 --> 00:45:29.801
Specially the people who has demon possession they also have this situation.

00:45:30.346 --> 00:45:36.476
When this chakra will enlighten Then person security will increase.

00:45:36.562 --> 00:45:52.796
Now many womens have breast cancer. And people think breast cancer means something that happen because any other reason but the main reason is that women feel insecure then she will get breast cancer.

00:45:53.242 --> 00:45:59.523
Also many have breathing issues. We cured many breathing issues.

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:10.399
Kashmir governor mr. bhagvan sale sahe. he has breathing issue from 25 years but we cured it in 5 minutes.

00:46:10.508 --> 00:46:19.098
If you cured this chakra by giving vibrations then person will cure permanently.

00:46:19.138 --> 00:46:28.625
Because when his chakra is cured immediately jagdamba will wake up and then his insecurity will destroy and he lives very peacefully.

00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:38.306
Above that chakra is Vishuddhi chakra. Which is most important chakra because human changed from animal to human due to this chakra only.

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:46.989
He raised his neck from down to up and their he became human. And we should not bow this neck in front of anyone.

00:46:48.481 --> 00:47:00.552
It should not bow down in front of untruth. But if almighty god is their or the person who is commendable then you should bow down you neck.

00:47:00.771 --> 00:47:09.436
And always we get underfoot of anyone. then may be he is devil or anything else. We should not put our hand below everyone.

00:47:09.468 --> 00:47:15.310
You should not ow down to my feet also. Till you get any identity you should not come to feet.

00:47:15.438 --> 00:47:22.820
But we have two types experiance, When we were in London people think that, Why should we come to the feet of mataji? But every work will done by our feets only then, What can I do?

00:47:24.391 --> 00:47:29.507
So the have this problem that. Why should we come to the feet of shri mataji? After realization also.

00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:39.302
Here in village I told them, Now dont want any optics.Then everyone become sad, and telling "mataji not given optics." So these two opposite points.

00:47:39.388 --> 00:47:49.445
So,I want tell you wisely that, Human is an animal Specially created in high altitude.

00:47:49.632 --> 00:47:56.594
S o he should not bow down to everyone. Also this is the place of clossal. Clossal means all this.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:03.258
same like this almighty god is everything, like us and in that we are small-small cells.

00:48:03.586 --> 00:48:10.265
These cells which we are only created like god only.When these cells awakened then they get to know clossal.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:20.849
Now this clossal state recognised from here. Now the people who eat tobacco, Now in nagar I dont see Tobacco ripen much but everyone living here eat tobacco.

00:48:21.224 --> 00:48:33.026
So, from where this tobacco came, I dont know. But womens also eat that black color something.So what is that and from where it came, I dont know.

00:48:33.198 --> 00:48:44.409
But because of that tobacco this chakra of people stick like this, their kids have cough their kids have cough and so on.And they also have breathing problems. all this happen because of tobacco.

00:48:44.519 --> 00:48:54.806
But, no one will listen, If we will tell that left tobacco. but in sahajyoga they have to do it.And people told many comedy incidents regarding how it(Tobacco) will escape.

00:48:54.907 --> 00:49:15.602
One Sahjyogi was their, He was very active in sahajyoga but he cant left tobacco. one day when I went their then also he eat tobacco and I noticed that But I ignored.

00:49:15.782 --> 00:49:25.961
Then he is telling me that, "Shri mataji my face is like shri Hanumana, my mouth starts blowing, I dont know why it is happening? Am I became hanumana in sahajyoga?"

00:49:26.704 --> 00:49:34.314
Then I said, "now you tell me,do you eat tobacco or not?" then he said, "yes, We eat." and touch his ears (did action to forgive me). Then I said, " now promise me, I will exrtricate."

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:44.777
Try, little bit, because of realization it is not much necessary now. It exrtricated  already. And also unbuckle that less part. So that this face problem will solve. And after that he left it.

00:49:45.012 --> 00:49:53.457
Like this In sahajyoga everything will cure easily. And too Naughty treatments are there. And everyone should see happyli.

00:49:54.256 --> 00:50:03.928
After this, Vishuddhi chakra has too much importance because 16000 Channels are dependent on it.

00:50:03.964 --> 00:50:11.643
So you should notice that, When You smoke easily buying a cigarette with a penny, Then you are destroying 16000 channels.

00:50:11.749 --> 00:50:18.257
And you dont know little it also, How all that tied together? and  they run from where and how?

00:50:18.331 --> 00:50:28.067
And now in london many things happened, Doctors are telling and not only this but it is written on each and every cigarette that, 'Because of this you may die' But still people buy it.

00:50:28.159 --> 00:50:35.354
"Hey you sit, Did you smoke? no right then you sit." who smoke they can left.

00:50:35.467 --> 00:50:45.440
I am not telling that you should unuckle it now only.(Laughing). I know Who smoke? and who dont smoke?(Laughing again)

00:50:45.535 --> 00:50:54.205
Now, due cigarette many people get cancer and  many things but people cant left it because habits cannot left easily.

00:50:54.823 --> 00:51:02.190
Only we have to understand it by kind heart and when we cure our vibrations it will left automatically and easily.

00:51:02.253 --> 00:51:09.299
And after he left all these habits, human will come in such enviroment, which we can tell that 'kingdom of god'.

00:51:10.618 --> 00:51:18.594
The chakra above this is the agnya chakra. So I told you that every religion is the flower of the same tree.

00:51:19.525 --> 00:51:30.091
And we argue unnecessary that, this is my flower and that is my flower. Different different people raised by one energy did the work in this world.

00:51:30.142 --> 00:51:40.986
Just now I told you 10 gurus came. Same like that, this chakra, which is placed here on the head is called as agnya chakraon that shri mahvishnu place.

00:51:41.033 --> 00:51:45.111
Now who is this mahavishnu? we can know that if we read devi mahatmya.

00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:54.673
And its principle is shri ganesha principle. That means if one side of the coin is ganesha then another side is the place of mahavishnu.

00:51:54.814 --> 00:52:03.204
And mahavishnu took incarnation only once and that is shri yeshu khrist. That means khrist is none other than mahavishnu.

00:52:03.267 --> 00:52:12.407
And if you read about khrist then you will surprise because it is same as mahavishnu. it described as it is.

00:52:12.986 --> 00:52:20.157
And khrist mother, merry was the none other than radha.

00:52:20.228 --> 00:52:27.493
It is descried in mahavishnu description that Radha made her son by herself only and his father was shri krishn thats he called as khrist.

00:52:29.197 --> 00:52:35.801
No one understood there about why khrist known as khrist?because from the word krishi the krishn word is formed.

00:52:35.999 --> 00:52:41.256
Krishna did hard work and its fruit is the khrist.

00:52:41.437 --> 00:52:46.413
And it is also decsried in that, krishna gave his 16th authority to his son

00:52:46.476 --> 00:52:51.814
Also he will be the base of the whole world. and he will show to the world said by shri krishna.

00:52:51.867 --> 00:52:59.338
'NAINAM CHHINDATI SHASTRANI NAINAM TINDATI PAVAKA'(sanskrit shloka by said by shri krishna). as per this shloka Khrist will show to the world that this power cannot destroy by anyhing.

00:52:59.363 --> 00:53:04.096
And it to be saved in rebirth.

00:53:04.213 --> 00:53:10.830
So all these people living together. And we are quarreling with each other unnecessary.

00:53:10.885 --> 00:53:17.588
And everyone get to know about it after realization. And after that we get to know how to use everyone.

00:53:17.633 --> 00:53:25.792
And altogether because of his help omnipresent power will help us like that we also erase all petty ideas we will become global human.

00:53:41.559 --> 00:53:44.950
The next Energy centre Above this energy centre the Sahastrar.

00:53:45.169 --> 00:53:54.575
When Kundaini will piercing this chakra then only we can say that human got self realization.

00:53:55.122 --> 00:54:02.278
Khrist called it as Baptisam and mohammad called is as peer.

00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:10.662
In every religion said that we should get our realization.But in that also many misunderstandings happened Realization means not only the birth.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:18.918
When he get his rebirth then only we can called as 'dwij'.Now here if we say 'brahman' then we will hire him or we can do anything.

00:54:20.075 --> 00:54:28.348
But they dont have essense of brahmin. They are not brahmin by birth. Who got their rebirth or realization they are only the brahmins.

00:54:28.552 --> 00:54:35.676
And in this point of view we can call "chokhamela' as brahmin. and we can call many brahmins as petty.This is the situation.

00:54:35.778 --> 00:54:40.949
Now the day before yesterday I went to pune for the program. So the program was arranged in brahmin assembly.

00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:46.973
Then they get to know that Mataji is not a brahmin so they told, "We will not allow mataji to conduct program here".

00:54:47.026 --> 00:55:00.106
Then we told them, "see everyone know about the mataji and if you not allow us to conduct program then it will come in news papers and your name will spoil."Then they ok, If you arranged here program then do that.

00:55:00.356 --> 00:55:06.176
Then they agreed.These people(sahajyogis) not told me anything about it,

00:55:06.278 --> 00:55:15.346
but when I started program then I asked, "If any brahmin is here sitting in front of me then please stand up." and then 3-4 people stand up and told, 'ye we are brahmins'.

00:55:15.411 --> 00:55:22.249
Then I told them to put their hands in front of me then their hands starts shaking.Then I asked them, What is happening to you. Then they told, " shri mataji you are shakti, thats why we are moving."

00:55:22.343 --> 00:55:32.109
Then I told them , " yes I agree I am the Energy, But only you people moving not others, why?" they told, " these two people also moving." Ask them from where they came? then they(brahmins) get to know that other two  peple who are moving were came from mental hospital.

00:55:33.492 --> 00:55:41.070
So only we should not be egoistic. Dont think we are such great people. You should become great people. That should happen.

00:55:41.265 --> 00:55:49.924
And this lie people harasse saints. We know how these people harassed saint dnyaneshwar.

00:55:50.218 --> 00:55:54.807
After that at our place also they harassed shirdi saibaba.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:56:01.893
they had not left a single place to harasse saints. Not only this but Adi shankarcharya's mother died then he went to his home.

00:56:02.341 --> 00:56:07.013
and he told i want to do funeral rituals. Then people told, " no you cant do because you are ascetic.

00:56:08.162 --> 00:56:16.680
No one came for the funeral in kanedi village then he (shankaacharya) cut banana tree and he did funeral of his mother.

00:56:16.758 --> 00:56:24.883
And he cursed kerala people that, " You will do funerals in front of your home only." and today also it happens.

00:56:26.369 --> 00:56:33.307
In this way, all these unauthorised people insults saints.Not only in our country but in all the countries it happened.

00:56:33.332 --> 00:56:49.467
Even if you see at the time of mohmmad saheb, people harssed him too much. If you think aout that then we to know, dnyaneshwar maharaj was also not harassed this much.

00:56:50.467 --> 00:56:59.820
So all these people who harassed all the saints, today also they sit on the chairs with all rights and moving here and their with tagline we are  big ascetic.

00:57:00.359 --> 00:57:04.603
We should not entertain these people. In our sahajyoga big revolution happen.

00:57:04.751 --> 00:57:15.397
And it is because, real form the religion is expose and religion will estalish totally. So people get to know that about all these fake people and they are not entertaining them.

00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:19.745
Tradition means, to become silly is not useful.

00:57:19.832 --> 00:57:29.339
By which tradition human will become wise and he will come upper level and lighten up in spirituality, that is only the good tradition.

00:57:29.535 --> 00:57:35.980
And you will get surprised, these people not allow to live a saints.

00:57:36.176 --> 00:57:40.394
Common people lifted them. They hold on to thinness to Khrist also.

00:57:40.503 --> 00:57:47.981
Common people accepted them but these people not accepted saints.

00:57:48.044 --> 00:57:54.948
Some people have objection on me me also (laughing) but we are different kind. So they cant do anything to me.

00:57:55.229 --> 00:58:02.728
The day before yesterday one gentleman brought a lady with him and that lady was having epilepsy problem.

00:58:02.825 --> 00:58:09.957
So always I tell bring the people having problem after asking me.because with me some ghost energy people start shaking.

00:58:10.012 --> 00:58:16.301
So I told, dont ring them without asking me.and again he has epilepsy attack.

00:58:16.387 --> 00:58:23.558
I told them," why you brought her without asking me? Now she get epilepsy attack, If told me first then I keep watch on her, and may be this will not happen.unnecessary disturbance in my lecture."

00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:37.112
Then they get up and started politics. they are telling, " we are brahmins And we are worshippers. you are saint and saints should service people." ThenI said, "ok, and after that we should slapped by your shoes.Get out from here."

00:58:37.743 --> 00:58:47.313
But they are not ready to go.Then I told them, "Be cautious, If you come here again?" And always forced saints but this time we wont allow none of them. So much happened.

00:58:47.391 --> 00:59:00.579
Then they went. In this way not only they harassed but also hectored them. like 'saint should do everything for people. If people hit them 10 times then they should be victim. because we are very smart and spiritual people.

00:59:00.842 --> 00:59:08.259
In this way they did too much injustice with the saints Then also common people only saw everything.

00:59:08.535 --> 00:59:15.893
They(common people) opposed for this then they also harassed but then also common people always recognized saints.

00:59:15.948 --> 00:59:21.854
And also they worshipped saints. So our work is for these common people like us.

00:59:22.776 --> 00:59:44.099
Now the above chakra which is sahastrar chakra has 1000 petals But the doctors will say, "no,900 something, what we can say 2 less than 1000 petals are their.

00:59:44.177 --> 00:59:51.294
This is the debt.I say, "their may be 998 or 1000, what is the problem?"

00:59:53.134 --> 01:00:02.220
And because of this reason they are telling, we are not ready to do sahajyoga and they left.What we can call to these silly people?

01:00:03.924 --> 01:00:09.205
For these people only I did medicine. Because I have to talk with them so I have to learn it.

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:19.609
Now two wise doctors came with us. One russian and one is parsi doctor who lived in london for many years and did practice and also he is psychologist.

01:00:19.634 --> 01:00:25.494
All educated people come here and they studied your culture and

01:00:25.588 --> 01:00:32.244
Not only this but they studied about each and every god and meaning of the god. Means when  I sit to teach them sahajyoga they put whole univesity in front of me.

01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:39.634
And they sorted everything. I gave 84 lectures to them.

01:00:39.665 --> 01:00:56.858
But they sorted everything, what is this? whatis that? which god seated on which chakra? what should we do for this problem?How to raise kundalini? What is problem of that? Where it stuck? and many other thing they collected information about in detail. Now you people will learn from them because we always learn from english people only.

01:00:57.233 --> 01:01:05.162
(Clapping sound) You dont believe mataji's knowledge.So I bring them with me.

01:01:05.544 --> 01:01:13.340
But, You don't have an idea that what a big gift in the form of our great culture we got.

01:01:13.481 --> 01:01:22.364
And really what wecan say useless education system, In which you dont know anything.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:29.484
What is truth? what is omnipresent energy? Dont have any idea about this. dont have thought about it.

01:01:29.781 --> 01:01:43.436
So, If you praise western culture by  this useless education system, Then we can saythis much beauty and wealth is at home then also you are interested in begging.

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:52.916
Now when kundalini break the sahastrar chakra then you can experiance collective consciousness. means you will get experiance not the lecture.

01:01:53.516 --> 01:02:00.695
In english we can say that actualisation. You will experiance it. experiance means you will get wiseness.

01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:06.703
Your consciousness will become wise. This vibrations starts flowing from your hand.

01:02:06.821 --> 01:02:15.867
After That, in this finger you get to know which chakra is catched yours and others also. ecause when you come to your source then you get to know source of others also.

01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:28.996
Now, here we showed, but in other image we show which chakra placed on which finger.On which finger which chakra is placed on right side and left side and how to clear it.

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:41.625
Means a small kid also can tell you which chakra catched. My four year old granchild she is realized by born. Now a days many kids are realized by born and for god sake my four grand childrens are like that only.

01:02:41.657 --> 01:02:55.847
And among them youngest one who is 2 and half year old only. one of girl from them(foreigners)went to her and aksed her,"anupama tell me my which chakra is caughed?" then she told, she dont know much english but then also she told, "you left vishuddhi and nabhi is caugh."

01:02:56.637 --> 01:03:03.011
And she shocked, because a 2 and half year old girl telling about catches she asked me, " mataji how it is possible?" Then I told." it is subjective knowledge."

01:03:03.653 --> 01:03:11.113
This knowledge come from inner side. Now how we get to it is cold and it is hot? in the same way they know about that only we have to tell them names of chakras.

01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:13.687
They will tell you, "see this chakra catching and that chakra is catching."

01:03:13.727 --> 01:03:20.684
not only this But before coming here we went anoter place from nagar when we are coming to nagar one lady was sitting in front and she is moving like this,

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:30.992
Then I asked her," you have any problems in delivery time?" then she said yes. Her finger was shaking in front of me and this finger this chakra control the uterus. That means swadhishtan chakras controls the uterus.

01:03:31.047 --> 01:03:36.625
That means swadhishtan chakras controls the uterus. When we tell this, They will ask, Mataji how you know?

01:03:36.804 --> 01:03:42.569
But we can see everything in front of me. If this happen within us, and this can happen wiithin us. And it should happen within us.

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:50.039
Immediately it happens you will get collective consciousness. It will not happen by telling you that we all are siblings.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.961
Everything present in this world is present in this body only. Whatever you are that is we only.

01:03:57.336 --> 01:04:02.812
That means, the feeling of favour is machinery feelings, they are useless.

01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:06.601
Because, If our this finger get damaged then we can cure it by doing this.

01:04:07.469 --> 01:04:14.093
If you are the part and parcel of me then if I am curing your then what is favour I am doing in that.

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:25.319
In This state it is not necessary to tell that these are our siblings, it should happen.Immediately we rub our figers here.

01:04:25.382 --> 01:04:36.997
Now many childrens put their fingers in the mouth. Many psychologist dont have solution for that but we know, If the kid is realized then he will put only that in their mouth which you have catches on the chakra.

01:04:37.059 --> 01:04:41.755
Now one 11 month girl was their and she is telling, this chakra caught and that chakra caught.

01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:48.067
Their finger tell them because they have tingling or firing sensation in that. and they will do like this by their hand.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:56.661
Now this science is modern and and special. It is the science to know god. it is very big.

01:04:57.285 --> 01:05:03.411
And we should get to know this energy. And it is present within us. Only we have to awaken it.

01:05:03.575 --> 01:05:08.903
And many people take objection on this. They are telling kundalini jagaran is the most difficult work.

01:05:08.956 --> 01:05:16.785
They are telling,"kundalini jagaran is the most difficult work.And while doing that we jump like frog."and many more things they are telling.

01:05:17.051 --> 01:05:23.824
Now one gentleman sitting  by lifing up his legs in front of me. Then other people told them, " you cat sit like this in front of mataji." then he is telling, " let me sit like this or else I will jump like a frog.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:29.628
Then I asked him," why you are thinking that?" then he told me, " My guru told me after kundalini jagaran I will jump like frog."

01:05:29.746 --> 01:05:34.394
ThenI asked, " he was jumped like frog?" then he replied, yes. (mataji laughing). Now I should made you frog?

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:39.172
Istead of making you super human make you frog. Some people saying that '"roaring like lion" and so many things.

01:05:39.211 --> 01:06:07.855
We realized thousands of people. I was travelled many countries like Russia, chili kolambia, argentiana,china, Iran, Iraq, italy countries which we tell mediterian countries also I travelled And I gave realization but I dont see any of the humans are jumping like frog.

01:06:08.035 --> 01:06:14.871
And Everything went well. May be some of them felt warmth but no one had much prolems.

01:06:14.973 --> 01:06:22.637
We can say 100 out of 99 people dont have much problems.

01:06:22.874 --> 01:06:30.732
May be some of them felt warmth in their hands. Some people opinion on that, "it is very difficult."

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:41.818
But Suppose we made this difficult thing easy for you. So their is some thing special within us. Without that, it is not possible.

01:06:42.146 --> 01:06:55.145
 it is difficult, So we get certificates. So we should know that, something should happen thats why mataji searched tis thing.

01:06:55.508 --> 01:07:02.867
Istead telling mataji searched, you should think that mataji know something graet and she brought something great for us. She live us. We have rights on her, that why we rae getting this.

01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:12.336
We should take this because it is our right. If you are sitiing here with this thinking then only you will not become egoistic. because immediately you will become egoistic.

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:19.891
Mostly people from the city. and nagar is the city thats why I have talk by scaring only. But it is not happen in case of people from village.

01:07:20.001 --> 01:07:25.547
Our mumbai peoples are more special. because they have different mind set.

01:07:25.688 --> 01:07:33.862
Above them delhi peoples are their, because they are sitting on power. But if they have any disease then they will come

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:40.471
Doctors or others also, Our president was suffering from cancer then I cured him, I went london fro him. They know.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:47.991
Ut now he will not allow me to put this in news papers and publish anywhere else. Because it is not government work.So he will not do anything.

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:55.390
Like this many questions come in our mind. But then also we should get to know this is our mother work, our personal work.

01:07:55.625 --> 01:08:05.235
We should not do any formalities in that.It is the simple work. I am your mother not your guru.

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:10.868
But then we should give respect to this. We should respect mother. And it should understand by us.

01:08:10.923 --> 01:08:22.054
If you keepthis respect in you mind, then you get to know that you got very big thing in you life. it is you wealth of the many lifes.

01:08:22.218 --> 01:08:33.131
But after that, human should arrange some things. Because If The people who are going die in the water we kept them in the boat then also they will suffer for some time.

01:08:33.241 --> 01:08:44.577
Some people familiar with that, so we have practise some things and to know how to do that we opened centres near you. You can go there and you can ask them.

01:08:44.757 --> 01:08:56.478
ANd it has very easy method. by which you many of the disese will cure.So you can cure your diseases and as well as our photo also have vibrations, so you can use that also.

01:08:56.573 --> 01:09:05.314
And That people are very wise and they do such great work. And I dont have any about one day in nagar most of the sahajyogies will be there.

01:09:05.776 --> 01:09:14.361
You invited me here. For that I thankful to you.(Clapping sound)

01:09:14.565 --> 01:09:19.267
Now, who want to take realization, They can sit and those who dont want to take they can go.

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:24.298
We cant force anyone for that, because truth will not come to your feets.They dont want votes.

01:09:24.377 --> 01:09:30.541
So, Who want it they sit here gratefully and who will get it they will get it.

01:09:30.607 --> 01:09:35.544
By this your physical problems will solve.As soon your kundalini will rise

01:09:35.646 --> 01:09:43.566
Now, Day before yesterday at vardha one person has brain tumor. as soon as his kundalini risen he cured.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:48.405
Like this, sometimes it happen immediately. But it will not happen to all. I already told this.

01:09:48.539 --> 01:10:01.488
Now at your rahuri one lady was their, she cant listen anything. And I told in her ears on mantra and at the same time she can hear everything.

01:10:01.645 --> 01:10:09.293
So may be anyone made her bahira so as soon as I said mantra in her ears it went off and she can hear properly.

01:10:09.661 --> 01:10:20.692
We are not telling any lie here. Beacuse we are not going give anything from you we are here to give you.Who want to take it they can take it who dont want to take this they can go. We dont feel bad for this.

01:10:20.739 --> 01:10:27.934
Beacause I am a mother I feel everyone should get good thing.
