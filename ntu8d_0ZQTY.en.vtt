00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.880
So you, once you are in thoughtless awareness what happens

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.160
that no thoughts bombard your mind.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.120
Wherever you may be, you may be in America, you may be in any place.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.360
You are not bombarded by thoughts.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.000
So, what does that mean? Into very simple language we can say,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.720
it means that you do not reflect.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.160
You do not have a reflecting mind.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.840
Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja Yogis of today,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
which one should try to conquer.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.680
That you do not reflect.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.520
That's the only way you can achieve your steadiness.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.360
For example I have seen people,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.800
for nothing at all they'll just start laughing,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400
nothing at all.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.320
They see somebody, immediately they react

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.960
"This was nice but not so good."

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.280
They start giving their opinions, especially in the West, about everything.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.400
Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.400
and start telling what is best

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.280
and what is not the best, what is not good.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.760
And once they start saying something like that,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.880
mind becomes reflective.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.920
If the mind is not reflective, then you are thoughtless awareness.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.640
Watch anything, just you watch.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.040
Just witness. You should not reflect.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.360
If you are using your mental power, then this power subsides.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.240
This is a very common defect with people because,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.480
I think, you people

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.200
are more intelligent, you think. Maybe

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.160
I think, you are well educated, might be.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.440
I don't know, whatever you think.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.320
But this reflecting mind

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.760
is a very dangerous thing for spirituality.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.400
You'll never grow. And then with the reflecting mind,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.480
you have different emotions with something you reflect on somebody.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.320
Now if it's your son or daughter or something, you get identified.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.480
Identification with some is artificial.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.600
It's not in reality.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.400
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.040
Now many identifications you have dropped out.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.960
For example your bias about religion,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.680
about races,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.240
about maybe nationalities, you have dropped out.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.800
But still I would say, the reflecting mind still acts

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.400
and this is the greatest hurdle for the progress of Sahaja Yogis of today.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.360
I've been thinking "Why is it the reflecting mind

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.440
is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?"

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.840
If you could stop reflecting,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.640
immediately you establish yourself

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
in the ocean of peace.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.440
You watch something, just watch.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.200
There's no ripple of thought in your mind.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.480
Then you become extremely creative.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.160
You become extremely dynamic,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.760
you become extremely compassionate.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.600
You have no fear.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.280
Some people think, "If you are compassionate

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.080
you see this man might lynch me". You have no fear.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.520
All virtues that you have to enjoy

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.240
you can only enjoy

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.760
when you do not reflect.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.600
That means that you leave everything to the Divine.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.320
You are not in charge.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.280
You don't see that you have to be reflecting on something.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.800
This is the greatest power you have got, is not to reflect,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.680
not to look at somebody with that kind of thing.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.880
I have seen this is still there lingering.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.160
Perhaps I never told you about it, maybe one of the reasons.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.600
I don't say that it's only your fault but maybe Mine,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.120
because I couldn't find what was exactly wrong,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.320
that is the reflection that you have about others.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.840
Now I told you, have introspection.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.240
For introspection also it can be reflection,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.400
but that at least gives you idea as to where you are.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.720
But with that psychologically you can become extremely depressed.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.360
You can condemn yourself.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.920
Then you may not understand yourself

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.600
as a personality that you are

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.680
and you'll go on, sort of,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.080
losing your vibrations, losing your power.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.920
Because you are not control of yourself.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.200
So introspection, also, if it brings

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.280
about depression and demeaning of your personality,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.680
best is not to introspect also.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.640
Because all these mental activities, I have seen, create problems.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.360
But in a state where you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.880
introspection comes to you automatically.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.080
You see it automatically.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.240
You understand it automatically. You do not think about it,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.160
it just comes to you. The whole picture comes to you

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.560
and you are at peace with yourself.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.040
You are never in turmoil,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.880
never in trouble.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.880
Then you don't get angry.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.640
Then you do not argue,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.360
then you do not discuss,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:26.480
but you become as if dropped in to the ocean of awareness

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.520
and you don't have to worry

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.200
as to solve something.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.840
When you are reflecting,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.880
then you find that this power works.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.240
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that you have to project

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.640
and you don't have to reflect.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.520
Now when we reflect we absorb.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.800
When we reflect on something, we absorb that thing.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.200
And mostly our attention goes to the defects of others,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.120
"This person is no good, that is not good, this is,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.480
her hair is not all right, the sari's not all right."

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.880
This, that and all nonsense.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.920
So what are we doing, we are absorbing all the bad things also.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.480
Now when you start admiration of something.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:28.080
Then what happens that you may not get the bad things

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.320
but at least you are on a better line.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.000
But still, the admiration in thoughtless awareness

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.880
is really very deep.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.040
I saw this in the eyes of this great scientist.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.880
Absolutely he was just one with Me,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.360
and his eyes were like an ocean of peace.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.080
He was just looking at Me,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.680
and for quite some time and then he came to his thoughts

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.200
and he told Me that "This is what we can do with Your photograph."

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:12.040
So the depth in you will only come when you do not reflect.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.480
But it's very common with human beings, specially in the West,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.600
"this carpet is no good, that is no good,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.960
this smell is coming, that is there,"

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.720
always trying to judge others,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.920
judge other things.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.440
This is important? What is so important?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.680
If you are sitting in the garden of heavens

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.960
what does it matter where you are sitting, what you are doing?

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:48.480
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves of thoughts in our mind.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.440
I have already, once, described it by drawing.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.960
How the energy that falls on the right side

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.440
goes to the left side

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.280
and the falls on the left goes to the right.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:09.960
Crosses over because of two types of cells we have.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.800
Then out of this energy that goes to the right,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.760
the energy that goes to the left

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.720
it is sucked in partly into the sympathetic.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.840
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.240
That is the way it goes on reflecting.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.960
Now if you can suck in all that energy and put it on our sympathetic,

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.000
then all our energies will be thousand fold much more.
