00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:09.844
You must pray, to God and ask, what you want.

00:00:09.924 --> 00:00:14.244
Ask for: Complete satisfaction in my heart,

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.944
joy in my heart, bliss in my heart,

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:21.794
so that the whole world becomes blissful.

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:27.436
Give me love, love that I could love the whole world

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:32.109
and that the whole world becomes one in love.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:51.322
Give salvation to this… humanity.

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:57.786
Which is suffering.

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:04.008
Take me to Your feet.

00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:11.519
Cleanse me with Thy love.

00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:22.957
Now see if there is God or not?

00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:29.177
You can feel it within yourself.

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:31.197
He hears you.

00:01:31.277 --> 00:01:36.157
He understands you.

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:42.862
He’s the glory of all the glory.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:48.078
He loves you.

00:01:48.158 --> 00:01:50.708
He protects you.

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:53.002
He guides you.

00:01:53.082 --> 00:01:59.325
He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

00:02:08.397 --> 00:02:12.250
Any time, any thought is coming, you pray

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.967
and you will be moving in the waves of that ocean

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:25.485
which is unconscious mind,

00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:30.127
which starts with thoughtless awareness.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:10.729
If you cannot become thoughtless, you pray to Him:

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:14.916
Forgive me for what I have done

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:20.048
and forgive those who have done harm to me.
