00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:55.629
Who is going to find out?

00:26:56.999 --> 00:26:59.139
[UNCLEAR]

00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:02.769
Australia or to say your

00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:04.179
country

00:27:04.989 --> 00:27:07.079
which is very good at

00:27:07.889 --> 00:27:09.697
getting all the black money.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:13.019
to Switzerland.

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:16.679
[UNCLEAR] stupid things are done.

00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:23.624
What is the need to allow the money to

00:27:23.624 --> 00:27:26.064
go out of [UNCLEAR] I don't understand

00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:27.930
cash money, you see

00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:32.479
that only has black market.

00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:44.889
[UNCLEAR] maybe taxation binds

00:27:44.889 --> 00:27:46.639
military things.

00:27:47.819 --> 00:27:49.119
You tax someone

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:52.759
all right, you tax for something sensible, nobody minds

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:55.629
but for buying military things and then seeking [UNCLEAR]

00:27:56.699 --> 00:27:58.279
What's the use?

00:27:59.064 --> 00:28:01.024
While your hard-earned money

00:28:01.424 --> 00:28:03.944
the tax payer is going in the

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:06.364
see of [UNCLEAR]

00:28:11.484 --> 00:28:12.604
[UNCLEAR] Where are you two going?

00:28:14.604 --> 00:28:16.824
She is buying all these materials,

00:28:17.124 --> 00:28:19.324
more materials, [UNCLEAR] finished.

00:28:22.104 --> 00:28:25.524
Then, its also, you see, a double solver

00:28:26.244 --> 00:28:28.584
also these horrible Argentinians

00:28:29.024 --> 00:28:31.044
people who killed their own people

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:33.519
are being punished now.

00:28:41.199 --> 00:28:43.949
All these dictators are [UNCLEAR] punished.

00:28:43.949 --> 00:28:45.209
That's a very good thing.

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:48.879
They needed some punishment.

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:53.469
Why is she the person who is harmed because she was collecting

00:28:54.744 --> 00:28:57.744
She started this, and another is America.

00:28:57.744 --> 00:29:00.924
[UNCLEAR] be in trouble. [I will see that UNCLEAR]

00:29:00.924 --> 00:29:01.924
very soon.

00:29:14.144 --> 00:29:15.924
Russia is in trouble too.

00:29:20.124 --> 00:29:22.224
It will work out, you will see that.

00:29:23.524 --> 00:29:25.804
You don't realize how [UNCLEAR]

00:29:44.684 --> 00:29:47.184
She [UNCLEAR] for ten people [UNCLEAR]

00:29:50.124 --> 00:29:51.124
finished.

00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:56.524
I will get you small plates for biscuits and cheese Mother.

00:30:16.464 --> 00:30:18.664
May I keep this as prasad?

00:30:59.644 --> 00:31:01.784
I think now there will be a revolution.

00:31:02.124 --> 00:31:04.384
in Argentina and

00:31:04.784 --> 00:31:05.804
[Chile ? UNCLEAR]

00:31:08.884 --> 00:31:10.004
In Argentina and

00:31:12.144 --> 00:31:13.184
Chile.

00:31:13.584 --> 00:31:15.024
[UNCLEAR]

00:31:18.124 --> 00:31:19.124
Did you follow?

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:23.299
She just doesn't follow. What's the matter?

00:31:25.069 --> 00:31:27.989
I said there will be a revolution now.

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:31.619
I don't know. [UNCLEAR]

00:31:31.619 --> 00:31:33.719
[UNCLEAR]

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.289
It's too good.

00:31:38.609 --> 00:31:39.609
You see

00:31:49.329 --> 00:31:52.539
But no communism. You see the trouble was

00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:55.389
these people were going to communism.

00:31:56.939 --> 00:32:00.059
If they had gone for democracy, [UNCLEAR]

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:03.409
Because communism is no solution at all.

00:32:04.584 --> 00:32:06.744
It's much worse than dictatorship.

00:32:09.564 --> 00:32:11.604
[UNCLEAR]

00:32:12.304 --> 00:32:15.224
Yogi: The communist not believe in God. Mataji: Not at all.

00:32:15.379 --> 00:32:17.919
[UNCLEAR] What's the use of having communism?

00:32:22.824 --> 00:32:25.724
Yogi: They are very materialistic even.

00:32:25.924 --> 00:32:26.924
Mataji: Very materialistic.

00:32:28.524 --> 00:32:32.684
And this was the mistake of Chile people and Argentina people to ask for communism.

00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:38.849
Communist wouldn't even know what has happened.

00:32:42.564 --> 00:32:44.864
Nice to see communism from far.

00:32:45.984 --> 00:32:47.124
How communism?

00:32:49.584 --> 00:32:50.824
That was a mistake.

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.819
Chile people are slo stupid.

00:33:14.824 --> 00:33:17.104
They don't understand what communism is.

00:33:18.424 --> 00:33:20.684
Russia will just come and sit on their head.

00:33:21.624 --> 00:33:23.584
Whatever happened to Poland see.

00:33:24.464 --> 00:33:27.104
Czechoslovakia finished, Poland finished.

00:33:27.624 --> 00:33:29.184
It could finish too.

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:34.859
Afghanistan tried to [UNCLEAR] something.

00:33:34.864 --> 00:33:35.864
They are sitting on their heads now.

00:33:38.904 --> 00:33:41.084
Only the Indians are saved.

00:33:51.149 --> 00:33:54.269
Yogi: Now the church.

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:57.559
Yogi: The Church in Chile, they are very political Mother.

00:33:59.149 --> 00:34:01.589
Mataji: Church? Yogi:Yes.

00:34:01.589 --> 00:34:03.364
[UNCLEAR] What about your Pope?

00:34:04.164 --> 00:34:06.184
[UNCLEAR] a political stunt.

00:34:08.764 --> 00:34:11.799
He said,"I don't want any war."

00:34:11.804 --> 00:34:12.884
I mean, who wants war?

00:34:14.224 --> 00:34:17.924
What is the need to say, "I don't want any war"? But give some solution.

00:34:18.684 --> 00:34:20.724
What is the solution?

00:34:21.789 --> 00:34:24.859
I don't want to be involved, everything is to be done peacefully.

00:34:25.709 --> 00:34:27.999
For that you don't need a Pope to say that.

00:34:43.629 --> 00:34:46.439
Church is for teaching them Capitalism.

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:54.409
Yogi: Catholic ..

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.364
How they? from the left people..

00:35:00.549 --> 00:35:03.424
Yogi: Communist people Mother.

00:35:03.424 --> 00:35:04.764
They [help?] the Communist.

00:35:05.244 --> 00:35:07.204
The communist people they [killed?]

00:35:08.264 --> 00:35:10.504
They killed this and they killed this, that's all.

00:35:13.764 --> 00:35:15.264
So, they are just the same.

00:35:24.664 --> 00:35:27.884
What was your Mother's [UNCLEAR] Communism?

00:35:30.229 --> 00:35:31.609
That's [UNCLEAR] stupidity.

00:35:33.049 --> 00:35:36.119
[UNCLEAR believe in communism.

00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:39.199
[UNCLEAR]

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:42.159
[UNCLEAR]

00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:47.989
Yogi: In 1970

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:51.309
until 1970, I was [UNCLEAR] this [UNCLEAR]

00:35:52.179 --> 00:35:55.259
I was very active in Politics.

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:56.889
Because my

00:36:00.649 --> 00:36:02.939
mother [UNCLEAR]  and myself

00:36:02.939 --> 00:36:06.249
to do politics since.

00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:09.609
So [UNCLEAR]  and myself you were communist?

00:36:10.279 --> 00:36:13.659
I was [UNCLEAR]   You worked for communist that time? I was socialist.

00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:15.879
Yes communist.

00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:19.209
See, now you see the stupidity of communism is there.

00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:20.439
Complete.

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:22.929
That was the mistake.

00:36:24.249 --> 00:36:26.009
[UNCLEAR]

00:36:27.689 --> 00:36:29.509
They don't understand God at all.

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:34.139
They are absurd people.

00:36:35.544 --> 00:36:38.584
Sahajayoga would have never reached to [UNCLEAR]  were a communist.

00:36:44.404 --> 00:36:46.444
Of course, now, you have given up all your political.

00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:48.409
[UNCLEAR]

00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.589
He too was.

00:36:54.049 --> 00:36:55.049
I was never

00:36:55.099 --> 00:36:58.139
very much into. Mataji: But your brothers and sisters, were [UNCLEAR]  ?

00:36:58.139 --> 00:37:00.269
He is married.

00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:03.759
Wendy is

00:37:03.764 --> 00:37:12.189
Geraldo's sister. Wendy is married with my brother, so the relation is, he is my

00:37:12.189 --> 00:37:15.004
My brother is married with Geraldo's sister.

00:37:17.799 --> 00:37:20.769
Mataji: Rodrigo is your brother?

00:37:20.769 --> 00:37:22.829
Mataji: So Rodrigo's wife is Wendy? Yogi: Yes.

00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:25.759
[Yogis and Mataji talk about relations]

00:37:30.644 --> 00:37:33.184
[UNCLEAR]

00:37:54.904 --> 00:37:57.789
All these things should be understood in the light of the spirit.

00:38:01.669 --> 00:38:02.799
It's difficult to understand.

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:09.609
Without democracy you cannot have realization.

00:38:10.029 --> 00:38:11.029
Cannot work out.

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:14.419
I cannot go to any country which is communist.

00:38:15.549 --> 00:38:16.549
And do sahajayoga.

00:38:16.879 --> 00:38:20.119
Nor can I go to any country where there is [UNCLEAR]  rule

00:38:21.984 --> 00:38:25.444
So both are useless. Only democratic countries we can work out.

00:38:28.564 --> 00:38:31.339
We have thought we have done, you see,

00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:34.069
We have gone to France, Portugal, all these people are democratic.

00:38:35.459 --> 00:38:37.739
[UNCLEAR]  communism had [UNCLEAR]

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:31.549
This is what it is.

00:39:32.009 --> 00:39:34.629
Very wrong misleading

00:39:34.629 --> 00:39:36.849
things these are.

00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:23.684
The car fellow was just changing everything

00:40:23.684 --> 00:40:26.164
he was cheating.

00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:31.409
First he said something, and he changed everything horrible people.

00:40:34.499 --> 00:40:36.759
They are always trying to get your money.

00:40:37.489 --> 00:40:39.149
Spanish, you see, have worse

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:42.499
worst are these [UNCLEAR].

00:40:44.439 --> 00:40:45.439
what you call Italians.

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:48.419
They are the worst, terrible.

00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:51.859
Portuguese are very good people compared to Spanish actually.

00:40:52.419 --> 00:40:55.459
They are very good people, they don't cheat you, they trust you.

00:40:55.459 --> 00:40:57.689
They are very good people.

00:40:59.439 --> 00:41:01.069
We went to

00:41:02.979 --> 00:41:04.909
[UNCLEAR]   place

00:41:05.299 --> 00:41:06.299
[UNCLEAR]

00:41:06.859 --> 00:41:08.199
We wanted to buy some marbles

00:41:11.024 --> 00:41:13.744
[UNCLEAR]   small small pieces, small of marbles

00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:16.244
First, they said [UNCLEAR]

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:19.379
[UNCLEAR]  I mean really went on.

00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:22.329
All increasing decreasing, ever expanding,

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:25.339
every sort of thing, you know. I got so fed up.

00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:28.219
I went to 2 or 3 shops, [UNCLEAR]   these people, horrible.

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:31.179
Such a waste of time, you see. Then I  just thought

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:34.109
I said, "If the Italians" [UNCLEAR]

00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:37.269
[UNCLEAR]  she [UNCLEAR] in 5 minutes.

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:40.199
Got the whole thing very cheap.

00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:46.119
Such liars actually, terrible liars.

00:41:50.179 --> 00:41:53.459
I said this, I said that, unnecessary.

00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:03.399
Where have we parked the car?

00:42:07.724 --> 00:42:09.424
It's convenient.

00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:46.629
Yogi: I have just received

00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:48.799
[UNCLEAR]

00:42:49.519 --> 00:42:52.399
from England.

00:42:52.399 --> 00:42:54.679
I have just received a call from England.

00:42:55.479 --> 00:42:56.649
My wife,

00:42:57.499 --> 00:42:59.089
she has been bleeding

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:02.179
and

00:43:02.499 --> 00:43:04.399
they don't know what is ...?

00:43:04.909 --> 00:43:08.529
Mataji: She has been bleeding? Yogi:Yes Mother. Mother: How many months it is?

00:43:09.179 --> 00:43:10.369
Yogi:It's been 5 months Mother.

00:43:12.769 --> 00:43:15.669
Mataji: That's very [UNCLEAR]

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:18.709
is such a common trouble.

00:43:21.639 --> 00:43:23.729
Mataji: Many reasons are there for that.

00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:27.189
Some of them is that, they use those pills, you see.

00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:32.949
She maybe alright.

00:43:35.849 --> 00:43:37.079
anyway its common  [UNCLEAR]

00:43:37.459 --> 00:43:38.459
bleeding

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:43.609
Who else? I mean everybody had this trouble.

00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:46.529
She is  [getting too much UNCLEAR]

00:43:47.199 --> 00:43:50.189
She said it was quite a lot.

00:43:50.189 --> 00:43:51.939
She said it was quite a lot and

00:43:52.259 --> 00:43:55.299
if it carried on tonight, they would take her to hospital.

00:43:55.549 --> 00:43:57.139
It's an ordinary case.

00:43:58.264 --> 00:44:00.464
Nothing so extra ordinary.

00:44:02.524 --> 00:44:05.224
Is it too much or less?

00:44:05.224 --> 00:44:06.744
Yogi: She said it was a lot.

00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:09.039
Yogi: She said it was a lot.

00:44:09.489 --> 00:44:10.489
Mataji: It was a lot?

00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:14.169
Mataji: She talked to you? Yogi: Yes Mother,  she called me.

00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:18.299
Mataji: Now what did she  [UNCLEAR]  what do you  [UNCLEAR]

00:44:30.444 --> 00:44:32.024
Mataji: You should have told her that

00:44:32.784 --> 00:44:34.204
you have done sahaja yoga.

00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:35.809
Should have been better.

00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:39.949
Did you say that? Pray to Mother?

00:44:41.169 --> 00:44:42.209
Yogi: I did say Mother.

00:44:43.399 --> 00:44:46.559
She was having all these troubles because

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:47.559
she doesn't do sahaja yoga.

00:44:51.429 --> 00:44:53.329

Yogi: When I was, told to call

00:44:56.929 --> 00:44:58.369
urgently to England.

00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:15.379
Also she might have lifted something, or something like that.

00:45:15.379 --> 00:45:16.379
You see.

00:45:20.499 --> 00:45:23.809
[UNCLEAR] I can't understand too much.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:28.849
Because they start little bit little bit like that you see.

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:32.689
It's suddenly too much then there must be something she has done.

00:45:56.839 --> 00:45:58.919

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:28.249
Yogi: Actually, my mother left him because

00:46:28.249 --> 00:46:30.909

00:46:42.709 --> 00:46:46.059
[UNCLEAR]

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:54.119

Mataji: When did she join politics? Your mother?

00:47:15.919 --> 00:47:18.669
Mataji: When did she join politics? Your mother?

00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:21.699
Yogi: My mother was [UNCLEAR] in politics.

Yogi: My mother is very political, so that's why they are in trouble.

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:34.229

00:53:19.151 --> 00:53:20.351

00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:50.961
Something wrong with it.

00:53:50.986 --> 00:53:53.996
You've got this trouble, [UNCLEAR]?

00:53:53.996 --> 00:53:56.306
Yogi: Sometime Mother.

00:53:57.406 --> 00:53:58.706
Mataji: That's the reason.

00:53:59.286 --> 00:54:02.696
Mataji: That's the reason, that's why you can't hear me

00:54:02.976 --> 00:54:04.552
and you can't [UNCLEAR]

00:54:06.181 --> 00:54:09.161
You developed lot's of trouble during that Chile problem.

In Chile.

00:54:11.941 --> 00:54:13.452
Mataji: You were in jail?

00:54:13.673 --> 00:54:17.153
Yogi: No, my mother.

00:54:17.451 --> 00:54:20.171
Because it was horrible time.

00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:23.431
[UNCLEAR]

00:54:28.926 --> 00:54:32.186
I was so afraid Mother

00:54:32.186 --> 00:54:35.278
because  when they talked to my mother [UNCLEAR]

00:54:39.741 --> 00:54:42.391
You see, the knowledge should be such, you should know all your powers.

00:54:42.391 --> 00:54:45.191
You should now what's all is inside you, you should know

00:54:45.401 --> 00:54:48.421
what is wrong with another person, everything

00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:51.891
that is knowledge that is shuddha vidya.

00:54:51.941 --> 00:54:54.611
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] the lalita Sahashraranama.

00:54:54.611 --> 00:54:55.906
It's very difficult book.

00:54:56.941 --> 00:54:59.691
Mataji: Now you come to the point. Yogi: I have it.

00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:03.361
Mataji: Yes, you read Lalita? Yogi: I bought it in India, yes.

00:55:03.361 --> 00:55:05.711
Mataji: That's it, that is what all it is. All right?

00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:09.331
Now put your hand towards me and say, "Mother,

00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:12.601

00:55:17.317 --> 00:55:18.797
All right?

00:55:22.626 --> 00:55:26.036
If you have got Lalita Sahashranama, you don't have to do anything.

00:55:28.856 --> 00:55:31.816
[UNCLEAR] they don't know anything, do they talk? They don't talk of kundalini.

00:55:31.926 --> 00:55:36.353
They don't know anything. I mean they don't even have the knowledge.

00:55:36.378 --> 00:55:37.558
Leave alone anything.

00:55:39.796 --> 00:55:42.688
Knowledge is also not sufficient, which is not [shuddha UNCLEAR]

00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:46.110
which is not pure, shuddha vidya.

00:55:46.806 --> 00:55:47.806
Just, put your hand here,

Yogi: Mother, are you sure? Mataji: No no, this one, this hand, little lower.

00:55:56.906 --> 00:56:00.126
Now ask again, "Mother, are you suddha vidya?"

00:56:00.186 --> 00:56:02.626
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"

00:56:02.696 --> 00:56:05.116
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: Again.

00:56:05.116 --> 00:56:07.946
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: Again.

00:56:07.946 --> 00:56:09.956
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: Again.

00:56:10.276 --> 00:56:13.362
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: All right.

00:56:16.396 --> 00:56:19.396
Mataji: Everything you belong, all the knowledge you belong, where is

Mataji: Yes, everything, you will know where is hamsha,

where is what? Everything you will know. That is knowledge.

00:56:34.106 --> 00:56:36.076
all right? Yogi: I like to be

00:56:36.316 --> 00:56:38.406

00:56:38.936 --> 00:56:42.028
Mataji: Shri Chakra is already is here.

00:56:43.326 --> 00:56:44.326

Mataji: Bija mantra? Which one you practising?

00:56:51.266 --> 00:56:53.096
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam.

00:56:53.736 --> 00:56:55.376
Mataji: I see. Say before me.

00:56:55.741 --> 00:56:59.181
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam. Mataji: Again.

00:56:59.421 --> 00:57:03.081
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam. Mataji: Again.

00:57:03.161 --> 00:57:07.741
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam.

00:57:10.188 --> 00:57:11.224
Mataji: I am the

00:57:12.866 --> 00:57:13.866
All right?

00:57:14.706 --> 00:57:15.796

Work it out.

00:57:27.261 --> 00:57:28.146

day these boys are going to be here.

00:57:41.406 --> 00:57:44.206
These boys have come all the way from England for you.

They are going to stay here in this house, you see, this is, they got this house

What he is doing is [UNCLEAR] isn't it? Yogi: Thank you very much.

01:03:07.706 --> 01:03:09.726
Mataji: He is realizing it's different

01:03:11.206 --> 01:03:14.006
Yogi: Thank you. Mataji: Yes.

01:03:15.726 --> 01:03:21.706
There's a book we have got, I will give you one. All right? You go through that. [UNCLEAR] give him that book.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:26.326
But now, you establish sahaja yoga here, all right?

01:03:32.486 --> 01:03:35.266
You have got a house or some work? Have you got a

01:03:35.526 --> 01:03:38.646
room or somewhere to stay? Yogi: I live alone [UNCLEAR] Mataji: Where?

01:03:39.146 --> 01:03:41.266
Yogi: In here in Madrid.

01:03:42.946 --> 01:03:46.606
I live in a flat by myself. Mataji: Yourself? Yogi: Because I am a brahmachari.

01:03:50.271 --> 01:03:52.181
Mataji: All right, we will see your brahmacharya.

01:03:54.881 --> 01:03:55.881
Mataji: With the Mother

01:03:56.101 --> 01:03:58.961
when you try the brahmacharya, I will put you to trouble.

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:04.186
Yogi: With [UNCLEAR], who is the [UNCLEAR] ?

01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:05.806
Mataji: No no, what I am saying

01:04:06.471 --> 01:04:07.471
if you try any

01:04:08.966 --> 01:04:10.746
brahmacharya, you see

01:04:11.106 --> 01:04:14.246
Mother is a playful thing, she plays, see,

01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:15.931
isn't it?

01:04:18.346 --> 01:04:19.346
She is Kalawati.

01:04:19.906 --> 01:04:23.246
kala, very artistic, kundalini.

01:04:23.406 --> 01:04:25.026
She plays art with you.

01:04:25.226 --> 01:04:28.241
And she tries to bring you round, you see.

01:04:28.241 --> 01:04:30.771
All these ideas of brahmacharya will vanish soon.

01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:35.691
Yogi: I see, I need to raise my kundalini sooner.

01:04:35.826 --> 01:04:38.666
Mataji: No, no no. You are [UNCLEAR] there on top of your head. Just see.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:42.866
It's already risen, when are you going to rise? See yourself now.

01:04:44.086 --> 01:04:46.426
Feel it in your head, just come on

01:04:48.466 --> 01:04:51.126
All right? You don't have to rise anymore.

01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:54.106
But

01:04:55.246 --> 01:05:00.826
Now, if you get married, then realized souls are to be born, you know many realized souls are to be born.

01:05:01.206 --> 01:05:02.206
All right?

01:05:02.241 --> 01:05:03.981
Souls are to be born.

01:05:16.041 --> 01:05:18.651
Yogi: I have to find my Vairabhi.

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:22.086
Mataji: Vairab, all right.

01:05:25.606 --> 01:05:28.046
You will find in a sahaja yogini, a good one, all right?

01:05:28.406 --> 01:05:31.426
Don't worry. Now, you will, you will definitely.

01:05:32.246 --> 01:05:33.246

01:05:36.286 --> 01:05:37.286

01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:45.886
Yogi: Oh heaven, thank you Mother. Mataji: I will write it down your name.

01:05:53.931 --> 01:05:55.311
Are you peaceful? Ask him.

01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:01.791
Is there still thoughts?

01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:07.691
He is not thinking?

01:06:12.766 --> 01:06:15.546

Small book. Yogi: You have a small book? Mataji: No no, the small one. Yogi: yes Mother.

You should make it a point to come to England.

01:06:55.501 --> 01:06:58.001
Yogi: I lived two years in England but Ieft.

01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:02.441

01:07:02.441 --> 01:07:05.441
Mataji: And let me know first, you take my address from these people.

01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:07.391
