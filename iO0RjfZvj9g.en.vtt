00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.720
Welcome to all of you.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.400
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.000
which you could never dream before.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.160
And at this time you all have arrived

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.960
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.800
So I thank you for that.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.680
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.040
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.560
Still, as God has created them,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.000
He tries to do His utmost

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.360
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.640
alright on this Mother Earth.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.520
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.560
and the whole cosmos is in unison

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.440
and working out something very great today.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.480
This new revolution that has started,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.160
very, very silently,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.560
today is taking it's shape

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.960
and is providing a new future for all of us.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.440
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.600
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.160
It's not because I am here

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.120
but because this Mother Earth knows

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.960
that there are such great saints sitting here

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.880
and She is not going to disturb.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.000
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.720
means the village of the Goddess.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.920
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.880
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.520
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.680
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.120
as if it has got its realization.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.200
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.400
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.400
in the greatest amount.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.600
So we are here today

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.480
in a very big way

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.320
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.360
The coming of

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.359
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.240
Here we are to say

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.280
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.520
Here we are to manifest that and also

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.720
to create a commotion or a movement

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.320
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.520
is established in the cosmos

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.160
which will enlighten this country

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.160
and the people of this country.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.960
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.120
which is a very subtle movement going on.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.560
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.560
who tried to describe

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.320
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.720
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.200
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.920
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.440
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.489
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.480
but to attain that life is very difficult.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.880
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.760
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.840
no way less than those great lives.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.360
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.400
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.840
and people look at them

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.320
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.040
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.520
deeper understanding

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:46.680
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.440
These ideals are very important for human societies

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.360
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.600
and they will have no absolute measure

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.040
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.320
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.960
to get connected with God Almighty,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.280
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.960
By that we become our own master,

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.760
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.200
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.240
then is a serious thing.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.240
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.200
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.960
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.280
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.240
But these things are not to be taken

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.759
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.760
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.276
but try to face them and cure them.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.880
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.480
that Indians are very simple people

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.720
they are not complicated, Mother,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.760
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:48.040
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.760
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.400
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.800
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.680
you have come out of it,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.040
you have washed yourself completely

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:12.480
and today you are there united together to face

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.440
all that is absurd,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.320
all that is false, all that is wrong.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.880
It has to be a very formidable army for us

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.600
because if you see around, even in this country,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.840
you call it not complicated,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.760
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.640
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.160
and brainwash them.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.280
So you have to be very alert yourself

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.640
and you have to be very conscious,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:04.840
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.880
of ideal people,

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.720
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.920
Now on your way to our tour,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:29.160
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.720
it is a subtler dimension,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.215
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.400
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.520
It sees you as separate,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.000
your Self is separate from yourself.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.120
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.920
all kinds of misidentifications.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.840
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.360
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.880
some say we will not marry Indians,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.240
some say, we will not change the country,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.360
some say they will change the country.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.400
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.920
if we stick on to one country as our own

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.720
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.200
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.560
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.600
but it also expresses your personality

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:05.440
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.240
As I have told you many a times

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.680
God created only one world.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.760
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.000
But how blind we are

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.120
that we think we are different people,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.040
we are of different countries, of different races,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.320
of different castes, communities, cities -

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:47.360
then little, little rows, then houses.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:55.040
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.480
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.080
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.520
we have to be like lions,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.680
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.440
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.480
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.920
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.320
This ego covers the heart

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.040
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.200
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:51.600
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.600
then I must be

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:01.320
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.200
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.480
entity on their heads.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.080
Then they go to churches.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.560
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.440
who went to a church in France

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.720
and she has become

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.840
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.200
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.760
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.600
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.200
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.160
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.600
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.880
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.040
To get back some of them on your heads?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.080
So we have to be prepared to

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.080
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.760
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.200
come down even to the colour scheme,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.880
then it's all conditioning.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.840
This is too much, not good!

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.920
All funny, funny ideas

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.440
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.480
such funny brains picks it up.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.520
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.440
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.440
I mean just imagine!

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.560
Salt is so important for our breathing.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.840
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.080
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.960
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.960
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.240
and you people just try to be

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.000
impressed by all these ideas,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.960
and start torturing yourself.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.480
Last but not the least I feel now,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.720
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.920
Gnostic  g-n-o.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.080
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.920
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.560
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.560
Gnostics means the one who knew.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.880
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.720
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.120
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.440
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.280
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.480
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.520
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.640
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.840
that you must suffer.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:42.840
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.200
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.440
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.560
are seen on human mind today,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.960
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.600
And you are the answer.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.080
You are the one who is going to convince them.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.560
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.000
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.280
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.200
by that if something happens, let us have.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.960
But like our five-year plan in India

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.720
I don't want to do all the documentation

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.560
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.960
But today if you decide that

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.760
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.200
We are the ones who have to do all this.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.320
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.600
How can we be fussy people?

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.000
How can we be the people who are not saints?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.920
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.320
and of all the things of our ego,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:21.280
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.320
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.520
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.520
is how to criticize something.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.680
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.920
this colour should not have been used,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.440
that's not good, that's not good.”

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.480
What is good is to be seen,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.560
what is good in you, how much good you can have

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.400
and what is good in other people.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:59.320
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.960
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.480
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.040
all around you, within you

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.960
and in other people.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.080
May God bless you.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:20.351
Now I was aware of it all

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:21.695
That

00:20:21.719 --> 00:20:23.195
One very big

00:20:23.703 --> 00:20:25.703
Revolution is happening

00:20:26.123 --> 00:20:27.821
And that's about it to London

00:20:27.996 --> 00:20:29.276
I had very big lecture in London

00:20:30.172 --> 00:20:31.686
That revolution slowly

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:33.926
It was happening
in a good manner

00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:37.111
But today she is
coming to your aid

00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:42.424
She stands in your head
and you are her opponent

00:20:44.066 --> 00:20:45.166
If anyone

00:20:46.138 --> 00:20:47.190
Became a Hindu

00:20:47.214 --> 00:20:49.761
So he takes the saffron
flag and goes to rent it

00:20:51.443 --> 00:20:52.461
If anyone

00:20:56.016 --> 00:20:57.818
Buddha became

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:02.460
Know the Buddha

00:21:04.499 --> 00:21:07.534
The Buddha who received the light

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.849
But the one who considers us
Buddha takes on another flag

00:21:13.317 --> 00:21:15.020
But in Sahajayoga

00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:17.591
He does not go out
with any flags.

00:21:19.607 --> 00:21:21.090
It has its own focus.

00:21:23.169 --> 00:21:27.571
Now our first focus in India
is, 'My wife is not okay.

00:21:29.245 --> 00:21:31.245
My son has no job.

00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:36.009
My son has no job.

00:21:37.611 --> 00:21:38.928
and

00:21:40.436 --> 00:21:43.492
After we left, our eyes were,

00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:49.839
You start looking around,

00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:51.864
So those eyes can see

00:21:52.903 --> 00:21:55.863
That is what we have
been doing till date

00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:57.407
How much it

00:21:59.565 --> 00:22:01.267
How poorly it is made.

00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:03.634
What a sight!

00:22:04.412 --> 00:22:06.020
where is our focous

00:22:07.115 --> 00:22:10.403
how can be so
comfortebal in such away

00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:12.717
Are you

00:22:13.169 --> 00:22:16.425
Yes, who wants to spread the
shadow all over the world

00:22:17.139 --> 00:22:20.485
And for all the world to enjoy,

00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:25.068
What kind of lights do they use!

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.615
Just like the big light
houses on the sea,

00:22:31.122 --> 00:22:35.056
how can we do so
easily without you ?

00:22:36.612 --> 00:22:39.267
But there is also so little of it

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:43.342
And sometimes I am very surprised
to see that insignificance.

00:22:45.682 --> 00:22:48.014
As I said to you
today, I tell you,

00:22:48.864 --> 00:22:52.108
That, for the sake of
marriage, girls or boys said,

00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:55.124
I want a girl only

00:22:55.615 --> 00:22:57.615
Only Maratha's
son should be seen

00:22:59.218 --> 00:23:02.211
then what will happen
when he freez ?

00:23:05.433 --> 00:23:08.267
Yours! Then, 'Mataji,
this is what happened and that's it

00:23:08.324 --> 00:23:09.418
Back to another cry

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.956
Then our hope is Mataji
we cannot leave fast

00:23:16.852 --> 00:23:17.985
Then Die without food

00:23:19.826 --> 00:23:21.272
Why should you tell me

00:23:22.256 --> 00:23:27.573
I believe it is best to
be comfortable in a meal.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.979
what is fasting ?

00:23:29.566 --> 00:23:32.816
There is a snake, or a
scorpion, that rode on a limb

00:23:35.888 --> 00:23:38.434
Such trivial ones

00:23:39.005 --> 00:23:41.005
And extremely compressed

00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:44.418
Today people of our
country can make

00:23:44.418 --> 00:23:47.504
progress evenin
sahajayoga due to tendency

00:23:47.877 --> 00:23:51.296
These people say, you are a saint.
Because you are so naive

00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:56.177
Such is their opinion. There will be.
You mean I have no disagreement.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.127
But Sahayogi is simply
naive and does not work.

00:24:02.928 --> 00:24:07.000
First, we need wisdom and
understanding that we have today

00:24:07.349 --> 00:24:08.860
Standing on the edge

00:24:13.241 --> 00:24:15.241
These petty ideas.

00:24:15.527 --> 00:24:18.500
If we want to get married,
we will do it in our

00:24:18.525 --> 00:24:21.436
we are sahajayogi By the way,
we are comfortable with sahajayogi

00:24:21.729 --> 00:24:23.885
Will work The word 'walk'
is too much for you.

00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.280
ok anything will work .
so which are you ?

00:24:26.305 --> 00:24:28.325
which king you are,says
everything will work out!

00:24:29.817 --> 00:24:32.718
But the word 'walk'
should go smoothly.

00:24:33.702 --> 00:24:34.816
What is going on ?

00:24:37.061 --> 00:24:40.537
Instead of saying
'okay' or 'okay,'

00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:43.331
isn't this all shivaji maharaj ?

00:24:47.108 --> 00:24:49.179
Let us take a look at
these things and see

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:51.950
That we have come to Sahajayoga

00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:54.052
It's not just for selfish reasons

00:24:54.711 --> 00:24:57.682
That is what we came
to find ourselves

00:24:57.979 --> 00:25:00.142
For what the mothers
have given to the mother

00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:02.282
That we should open
our hands to others

00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:07.882
And we should see that
people should enjoy it

00:25:08.953 --> 00:25:10.440
They should be given love

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:13.858
But people with
narrow-mindedness

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:19.256
How to cure, then go into the pain
of fun in the room, Mataji Maja

00:25:19.499 --> 00:25:20.658
Pain in hand

00:25:21.213 --> 00:25:22.134
Will happen

00:25:23.483 --> 00:25:25.282
I got a job

00:25:25.392 --> 00:25:27.004
The hour went by

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:28.745
Will happen

00:25:30.681 --> 00:25:34.035
Do you deserve to be under
the umbrella of your mother?

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:36.434
Think about it

00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:39.156
Those fine ideas

00:25:39.608 --> 00:25:44.418
And apart from the contractions,
today I believe you are in the desert

00:25:46.164 --> 00:25:48.652
If you are wondering whether
fresh baked vegetables

00:25:48.677 --> 00:25:51.116
have been cooked in the
house, then it will be hard

00:25:54.044 --> 00:25:56.044
That's your wackiness

00:25:57.162 --> 00:26:00.221
Increased views and hours
are mind-blowingly great

00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:04.735
You belong to this
religion of that religion

00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:06.505
We are not of any religion

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:09.552
Religion is ours

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.344
We belong to no one's religion

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.656
We are yogis what religion
do we mother to religion

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:23.594
With a bit of it those
who are practicing this

00:26:23.935 --> 00:26:25.731
Let the days of
snake-eating come now

00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:28.831
Diagnostics Let
Your Kids Have Fun

00:26:31.593 --> 00:26:33.593
Many styling your

00:26:33.957 --> 00:26:36.290
Cut out the bad ideas.

00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:42.780
Unless you eliminate
those petty ideas

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.655
by then

00:26:46.369 --> 00:26:50.915
If a kite is tie with
stone, it cannot fly

00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:53.524
Your flight

00:26:55.015 --> 00:26:55.810
Could not happen

00:26:57.206 --> 00:26:58.203
Just like our lives

00:26:58.806 --> 00:26:59.997
We are done

00:27:01.131 --> 00:27:02.096
In all

00:27:02.952 --> 00:27:04.281
In terms of content

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:06.371
Sahajayoga  stands.

00:27:08.625 --> 00:27:10.257
And your All

00:27:10.876 --> 00:27:12.876
The kingdom of God is brought.

00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:15.939
But it should be
worth sitting there.

00:27:17.128 --> 00:27:18.850
Thoughts should be independent

00:27:19.358 --> 00:27:23.180
Thinking that I got into
this clan I thought something

00:27:23.362 --> 00:27:25.362
Maratha of 96 clan

00:27:25.552 --> 00:27:27.098
Or I become brahmin

00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:31.011
Content is all over us

00:27:33.131 --> 00:27:34.060
liar again.

00:27:34.289 --> 00:27:35.242
With credit

00:27:36.837 --> 00:27:38.837
Ashamed of sahajayogi

00:27:40.781 --> 00:27:42.234
I am sahajayogi

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:43.966
I'm free.

00:27:44.735 --> 00:27:47.961
I'm on the alert.
You told me something

00:27:48.583 --> 00:27:49.985
And I'm not gonna do it

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:52.739
I stand at liberty

00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:55.112
I have autocorrect enabled

00:27:55.405 --> 00:27:57.018
You don't teach me anything

00:28:01.668 --> 00:28:03.827
Get away from all relations

00:28:04.755 --> 00:28:08.942
You will not be able to come up
like lotus until you swallow it all

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:13.154
Until then your anything
No use and no fun

00:28:18.336 --> 00:28:20.336
Now, if we have a
campaign like this

00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:28.749
In Pune, Come at Savarkar Statue

00:28:30.757 --> 00:28:31.921
so what you do there ?

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.600
So there were
thousands of people

00:28:37.965 --> 00:28:39.310
Unpleasantness

00:28:39.817 --> 00:28:40.845
If you want to teach

00:28:40.845 --> 00:28:43.095
Thousands of people will leave

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:44.696
Run away

00:28:45.363 --> 00:28:46.944
Because there is Unpleasantness

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:51.269
But in the court of love

00:28:52.062 --> 00:28:54.062
Get rid of it all.

00:28:54.356 --> 00:28:59.233
It is not ready.
All of this wears off in the dirt

00:29:03.684 --> 00:29:05.684
By breaking into this paradigm

00:29:07.248 --> 00:29:09.248
Stand in Sahajayoga

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.592
It should not weak

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.467
It should be strong

00:29:15.554 --> 00:29:16.549
This is new

00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.049
Such people should
be raised today

00:29:19.763 --> 00:29:23.730
thousands of mahatma gandhi
Thousands of lenin were raised

00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:29.854
thousands of like Abraham Lincoln
were raise like People should say

00:29:31.219 --> 00:29:32.803
But there is no difference

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:36.679
That is what the nose,
the mouth and the feet are like

00:29:37.702 --> 00:29:39.702
Just look at how far the
soul has reached the light

00:29:42.424 --> 00:29:46.571
And we are saints,
we are saints.

00:29:47.602 --> 00:29:49.602
All this is a disorder

00:29:51.046 --> 00:29:53.046
It's a stigma for us

00:29:53.712 --> 00:29:58.866
We will break it down,religion and
all and forget about everything

00:30:00.143 --> 00:30:02.252
Unless you decide to

00:30:02.665 --> 00:30:04.665
You will not benefit at
all in the sahajayoga

00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:07.259
And for us too, it's Trouble

00:30:11.052 --> 00:30:12.486
Let's get bigger

00:30:13.557 --> 00:30:15.557
The sea went anywhere

00:30:15.961 --> 00:30:17.316
That nobody is in the mind

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.471
That is our sea of Alibaug

00:30:22.249 --> 00:30:23.847
or is a Mumbai sea

00:30:24.902 --> 00:30:26.508
The ocean is ocean

00:30:26.865 --> 00:30:28.464
Such a saint is a saint

00:30:29.701 --> 00:30:31.395
Which is a sign of saint and

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:34.946
The main symptom of this
is that apprehension

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.813
Artificial

00:30:37.845 --> 00:30:41.095
Beyond the artificial
small shrines

00:30:42.032 --> 00:30:43.232
Their vision is relaxed

00:30:43.882 --> 00:30:45.233
Very endearing

00:30:48.185 --> 00:30:53.113
At that time as a call for
cooperation, the whole world refuses

00:30:53.914 --> 00:30:55.576
The key is how we
become what you are

00:30:57.623 --> 00:30:59.623
We are gonna do
whatever you want

00:31:00.432 --> 00:31:02.924
We are this we are that

00:31:03.844 --> 00:31:05.333
Who are you lets see

00:31:06.515 --> 00:31:08.515
So what do we do

00:31:10.745 --> 00:31:13.427
Just get rid of this
illusion of stupidity

00:31:14.594 --> 00:31:16.594
You can remove
this with kundalini

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:20.014
Today they are cheearing
me for Adi Shakti ,so do it

00:31:21.323 --> 00:31:23.844
What happen with it but
what is the benefit.

00:31:27.002 --> 00:31:28.349
If ours

00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:30.003
In cheers

00:31:31.073 --> 00:31:32.527
You forget all

00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:35.225
Are under our mother's feet

00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:38.227
And this universe is made by her

00:31:39.417 --> 00:31:43.796
We are special sahajayogi
from that world

00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:46.035
If you think about it

00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:49.209
Then your own
perception will change

00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:50.993
And about self

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:53.226
Whichever is wrong ideas

00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:54.942
they fix it

00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:56.498
Among themselves

00:31:57.157 --> 00:31:57.921
love

00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:02.662
Not only that, but huge power

00:32:03.916 --> 00:32:05.682
One is living among themselves

00:32:06.023 --> 00:32:06.764
Be aware of that

00:32:07.597 --> 00:32:09.597
And we with a great power

00:32:09.843 --> 00:32:11.237
Come together

00:32:11.602 --> 00:32:12.874
And with this power

00:32:13.318 --> 00:32:15.318
You will notice that
We are about to be saved

00:32:18.632 --> 00:32:21.887
Today some hindi language
known people who has come so

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:28.111
I always told to Marathi people
That you try to learn Hindi

00:32:28.111 --> 00:32:31.099
Because its your
national language but

00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:32.602
Will have to say to
Hindi people also

00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:35.609
Is it good to learn
a little Marathi

00:32:35.609 --> 00:32:41.357
Although I think that The Marathi
language is a bit too powerful

00:32:41.357 --> 00:32:46.354
And its depth can not come in
any language okey leave Sanskrit

00:32:46.378 --> 00:32:49.859
After this any
Colloquial language has

00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:56.477
For Kundalini Marathi language
is very smooth and very

00:32:59.732 --> 00:33:01.069
In use

00:33:01.356 --> 00:33:04.672
However, the place of
Hindi language is very high

00:33:04.697 --> 00:33:07.855
and ever Marathi people
should know Hindi language

00:33:07.855 --> 00:33:09.986
Similarly, you people also
have a Marathi Language

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.858
learning should not be difficult

00:33:11.859 --> 00:33:15.855
What am I talking about today

00:33:15.855 --> 00:33:18.605
That of the big revolution
We stand on the post

00:33:18.605 --> 00:33:24.603
Right now in front of us
It is a big request that

00:33:25.296 --> 00:33:29.546
We are sahajayogi
Have earned yoga

00:33:29.859 --> 00:33:36.603
we are not like that Which
are full of dirty thoughts

00:33:36.603 --> 00:33:39.305
Who do not love each other

00:33:39.329 --> 00:33:43.553
and one Have violent
tendencies towards each other

00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:48.102
We are yogis We gonna
join all over the world

00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:52.357
We are especially representative

00:33:52.357 --> 00:33:57.916
And we are saints and the
characteristics of saints

00:33:57.916 --> 00:34:01.169
Its in us Must seen

00:34:01.356 --> 00:34:04.656
When it show everyone

00:34:04.656 --> 00:34:07.653
It will be understood that
Sahaja Yoga is a special thing

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:10.605
Otherwise people will think
that your sahajayogi then what?

00:34:10.605 --> 00:34:13.360
Your habits are the same
Your ways are the same

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.856
You fight likewise The
group bet is the same in you

00:34:17.856 --> 00:34:20.358
All your values
Like that of others

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:23.358
So what about Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:23.358 --> 00:34:27.857
In Sahaja Yoga we have
externally Received nothing

00:34:27.857 --> 00:34:32.355
But the strong power
inside We live in

00:34:32.759 --> 00:34:38.256
And all our world
have this power today

00:34:38.256 --> 00:34:42.258
See that The power is
inhabited by all of us.

00:34:42.258 --> 00:34:48.753
It is roaming inside us Her
beautiful environment inside

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:51.236
Made up and mutual
love and we know

00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:58.832
Not so much, every
moment, Power feeds us

00:34:58.832 --> 00:35:01.979
Binds us to each other

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.225
This power is the formula of
the whole world that we got

00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:11.723
And when we found it We
do such useless things

00:35:11.723 --> 00:35:17.227
Of course Ready to destroy life

00:35:17.432 --> 00:35:22.931
We have to evaluate ourselves Will
have to know what is our value

00:35:22.931 --> 00:35:26.687
And what did we
understand our life

00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:30.436
I see that

00:35:30.436 --> 00:35:33.433
To quarrel is a human nature

00:35:33.433 --> 00:35:35.932
Whatever happens to
him They start fighting

00:35:35.932 --> 00:35:39.183
Like this with dog
cat I am not even seen

00:35:39.685 --> 00:35:42.184
If anything happens It
becomes a matter of quarrel

00:35:42.184 --> 00:35:47.435
Even if love is something
Sahaja Yoga is only for love

00:35:48.684 --> 00:35:52.524
Movement just love movement

00:35:52.548 --> 00:35:55.278
And you are sitting
in the same movement

00:35:55.686 --> 00:36:03.436
A very beautiful and very sweet
This is the environment I travel to

00:36:04.918 --> 00:36:09.664
But it can happen when
your subtlety Be so deep

00:36:10.039 --> 00:36:16.288
That we can see that we are
representative of divine

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:20.905
Divine doing this job
from us What a great thing

00:36:21.034 --> 00:36:23.536
To achieve this unique thing

00:36:23.536 --> 00:36:29.534
You need to be aware of yourself
Be and be your own personality

00:36:29.534 --> 00:36:33.254
Give her such a
huge strain Tease

00:36:33.254 --> 00:36:37.283
Today is the first day
When everyone has come

00:36:37.283 --> 00:36:41.784
See how well everyone is sitting It is
a matter of great pride for a mother.

00:36:41.784 --> 00:36:44.784
That all my children here
are gathered from the world

00:36:47.037 --> 00:36:53.033
But every time I want
that you become aware

00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:56.285
You have to know that Mother
is doing very big revolution

00:37:10.971 --> 00:37:12.527
You guys

00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:15.606
Watch you wake up

00:37:16.042 --> 00:37:18.042
That our mother

00:37:18.097 --> 00:37:19.487
That is a very big achievement

00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:22.161
Which will wipe out all the universe

00:37:23.272 --> 00:37:25.804
This is a very big achievement

00:37:26.502 --> 00:37:28.502
Is doing and you

00:37:28.795 --> 00:37:30.396
We are in limbo.

00:37:32.148 --> 00:37:37.233
May god bless you
