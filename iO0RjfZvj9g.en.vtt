WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:04.720
Welcome to all of you.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.400
This great country is also passing through a crisis.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.680
Nowadays I feel there are so many things that are happening

00:29.880 --> 00:33.000
which you could never dream before.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.160
And at this time you all have arrived

00:36.360 --> 00:40.960
bringing peace and joy to all of them.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.800
So I thank you for that.

00:56.680 --> 01:02.680
The strife and the strain which is on human beings is

01:03.080 --> 01:11.040
perhaps because they are not yet worthy of God's blessings.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.560
Still, as God has created them,

01:16.280 --> 01:20.000
He tries to do His utmost

01:20.280 --> 01:23.360
to see that human beings are kept comfortably

01:23.560 --> 01:26.640
alright on this Mother Earth.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.520
He creates all kinds of beautiful things as you see

01:30.840 --> 01:34.560
and the whole cosmos is in unison

01:34.960 --> 01:39.440
and working out something very great today.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.480
This new revolution that has started,

01:44.040 --> 01:47.160
very, very silently,

01:47.520 --> 01:50.560
today is taking it's shape

01:50.760 --> 01:56.960
and is providing a new future for all of us.

01:57.240 --> 02:01.440
You see those big, big trees, that are on top of your head

02:01.800 --> 02:07.600
and as long as you are sitting here no fruit will fall upon you.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.160
It's not because I am here

02:10.360 --> 02:13.120
but because this Mother Earth knows

02:13.320 --> 02:15.960
that there are such great saints sitting here

02:16.160 --> 02:19.880
and She is not going to disturb.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.000
This place was called as Shrigaav I was told,

02:29.320 --> 02:34.720
means the village of the Goddess.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.920
And this fruit is called as Shriphal,

02:39.120 --> 02:41.880
meaning the fruit of the Goddess.

02:42.160 --> 02:48.520
But actually if you see, a coconut is something like our Sahasrara

02:49.560 --> 02:56.680
and is very auspicious because it can absorb lot of vibrations,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.120
as if it has got its realization.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.200
As you people can absorb My vibrations,

03:04.400 --> 03:09.400
this fruit can absorb also My vibrations,

03:10.120 --> 03:14.400
in the greatest amount.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.600
So we are here today

03:18.800 --> 03:22.480
in a very big way

03:27.080 --> 03:33.320
to advertise the coming of the New Age.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.360
The coming of

03:39.960 --> 03:45.359
the Golden Era, people have talked about.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.240
Here we are to say

03:49.480 --> 03:55.280
what is reality, what is truth, what is joy.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.520
Here we are to manifest that and also

04:05.920 --> 04:11.720
to create a commotion or a movement

04:12.360 --> 04:19.320
in the cosmos so that this new awareness

04:20.280 --> 04:25.520
is established in the cosmos

04:25.880 --> 04:29.160
which will enlighten this country

04:29.360 --> 04:32.160
and the people of this country.

04:32.600 --> 04:37.960
Also you will pick up the threads of this movement within yourself

04:38.160 --> 04:43.120
which is a very subtle movement going on.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.560
At this moment we are in a strife of an intellectual

04:49.760 --> 04:53.560
who tried to describe

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Shri Rama and Shri Krishna, in a slurring manner.

04:59.720 --> 05:06.320
And this is the time I want to bring your attention

05:06.760 --> 05:14.720
that if this intellectual strife to use the intelligence

05:14.960 --> 05:21.200
to bring down all the ideals which enlighten our path,

05:21.480 --> 05:25.920
which gives us the guideline and an aspiration,

05:26.400 --> 05:33.440
then our lives become absolutely mundane, useless, joyless.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.489
It's very easy to condemn an ideal life,

05:41.320 --> 05:45.480
but to attain that life is very difficult.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.880
And some people, because they cannot attain it,

05:50.080 --> 05:56.760
try to condemn it so that they feel that they are no less,

05:57.040 --> 06:00.840
no way less than those great lives.

06:03.560 --> 06:08.360
All these ideals are created, these images are created,

06:08.560 --> 06:14.400
everywhere in the world by the Divine power

06:16.040 --> 06:19.840
and people look at them

06:20.040 --> 06:27.320
and think that these great lives are beautiful,

06:27.640 --> 06:34.040
though they have suffered a lot, but there is so much of

06:34.600 --> 06:39.520
deeper understanding

06:39.880 --> 06:46.680
and deeper balancing and a deeper love.

06:49.400 --> 06:56.440
These ideals are very important for human societies

06:56.720 --> 07:00.360
otherwise they will be absolutely living in a relatively

07:00.600 --> 07:06.600
and they will have no absolute measure

07:07.080 --> 07:11.040
to find out what is right and what is wrong.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.320
In Sahaja Yoga we are here first of all

07:16.520 --> 07:18.960
to get connected with God Almighty,

07:19.160 --> 07:23.280
with His power, the All-Pervading Power of Chaitanya.

07:23.720 --> 07:28.960
By that we become our own master,

07:29.280 --> 07:34.760
in the sense that we get our own guidelines.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.200
If some Sahaja Yogi has not achieved that much

07:38.440 --> 07:41.240
then is a serious thing.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.240
At least a Sahaja Yogi should be able to see,

07:44.440 --> 07:50.200
at the minimum of minimum, what is wrong with that person.

07:54.520 --> 08:00.960
To cleanse yourself and to put yourself right is of course,

08:01.560 --> 08:08.280
is a very important duty of every Sahaja Yogi.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.240
But these things are not to be taken

08:11.440 --> 08:14.759
as condemnation of yourself by any chance.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.760
And you should not be identified with those problems that you have

08:18.960 --> 08:25.276
but try to face them and cure them.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.880
Many a times I have heard Sahaja Yogis saying

08:29.080 --> 08:31.480
that Indians are very simple people

08:31.680 --> 08:33.720
they are not complicated, Mother,

08:34.000 --> 08:39.760
so they can achieve their ascent much faster.

08:40.280 --> 08:48.040
But it's not that. It is very different for all of you, very much.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.760
And despite all the complications, and all kinds of brain washing,

08:51.960 --> 08:55.400
and all kinds of book reading and all kinds of so-called seeking,

08:55.600 --> 08:58.800
and all that nonsense one has gone through,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.680
you have come out of it,

09:02.080 --> 09:05.040
you have washed yourself completely

09:05.360 --> 09:12.480
and today you are there united together to face

09:12.760 --> 09:15.440
all that is absurd,

09:15.640 --> 09:19.320
all that is false, all that is wrong.

09:20.120 --> 09:25.880
It has to be a very formidable army for us

09:26.240 --> 09:30.600
because if you see around, even in this country,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.840
you call it not complicated,

09:33.040 --> 09:36.760
there are many who are all the time to complicate others

09:37.000 --> 09:43.640
and to destroy all their ideals, destroy all their visions

09:43.880 --> 09:49.160
and brainwash them.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.280
So you have to be very alert yourself

09:54.480 --> 09:57.640
and you have to be very conscious,

09:57.840 --> 10:04.840
that it is you who is going to build up this great image

10:05.080 --> 10:09.880
of ideal people,

10:10.160 --> 10:16.720
not one ideal life but ideal people in all collectivities.

10:17.400 --> 10:21.920
Now on your way to our tour,

10:22.120 --> 10:29.160
you are now on the threshold of entering into a new dimension,

10:29.800 --> 10:32.720
it is a subtler dimension,

10:33.200 --> 10:38.215
and this subtler dimension is within ourselves.

10:38.840 --> 10:45.400
And there lies your own being as your Spirit.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.520
It sees you as separate,

10:49.920 --> 10:54.000
your Self is separate from yourself.

10:54.280 --> 11:00.120
All these identifications have to be dropped out,

11:00.600 --> 11:03.920
all kinds of misidentifications.

11:04.360 --> 11:09.840
I was reading one of the marriages lists and all that,

11:10.040 --> 11:13.360
somebody says that they will marry Indians,

11:13.560 --> 11:15.880
some say we will not marry Indians,

11:16.080 --> 11:18.240
some say, we will not change the country,

11:18.440 --> 11:22.360
some say they will change the country.

11:26.400 --> 11:31.400
Even after Sahaja Yoga (...)

11:31.720 --> 11:35.920
if we stick on to one country as our own

11:37.200 --> 11:41.720
then I must say that we have to give up those limitations.

11:42.000 --> 11:48.200
The time has come. Of course you have the choice.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.560
Nobody is going to force you to do anything

11:52.760 --> 11:57.600
but it also expresses your personality

11:58.440 --> 12:05.440
that you still are lingering on to these small, small limitations.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.240
As I have told you many a times

12:11.600 --> 12:14.680
God created only one world.

12:14.960 --> 12:19.760
Of course He created varieties just to create beauty.

12:20.280 --> 12:24.000
But how blind we are

12:24.400 --> 12:29.120
that we think we are different people,

12:29.400 --> 12:34.040
we are of different countries, of different races,

12:34.400 --> 12:40.320
of different castes, communities, cities -

12:40.600 --> 12:47.360
then little, little rows, then houses.

12:47.800 --> 12:55.040
I would say we become from human beings to rats and rats to worms

12:55.280 --> 13:00.480
and then I don't know what is the situation later .

13:01.400 --> 13:06.080
Let's open our heart, let's become great,

13:06.520 --> 13:09.520
we have to be like lions,

13:09.840 --> 13:15.680
not to be small and creepy people like worms.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.440
There are many worms everywhere in the world.

13:19.680 --> 13:24.480
We are specially chosen people to be something great.

13:24.920 --> 13:29.920
So open your heart. That's the main problem.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.320
This ego covers the heart

13:33.560 --> 13:39.040
and makes you feel that, “Now I am an Indian, I am a Christian,

13:39.240 --> 13:43.200
I am this thing, I am that thing.”

13:43.720 --> 13:51.600
Now if I say to someone that you are not to go to temple,

13:52.880 --> 13:55.600
then I must be

13:55.880 --> 14:01.320
a very cruel person to say that not to go to a temple.

14:04.120 --> 14:10.200
But they go to a temple and come back with such a big

14:11.960 --> 14:15.480
entity on their heads.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.080
Then they go to churches.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.560
The other day I had a very bad experience of a lady

14:21.760 --> 14:26.440
who went to a church in France

14:26.640 --> 14:29.720
and she has become

14:29.960 --> 14:33.840
something like a minister, maybe something like a pope.

14:34.800 --> 14:39.200
I mean something very funny you know, nothing normal.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.760
I couldn't discover it, when I asked she said, “I went to a church.”

14:43.960 --> 14:48.600
“Why?”
“Because they arranged a marriage there." “Why?”

14:48.920 --> 14:51.200
“Oh, they wanted to have a big social event

14:51.400 --> 14:53.160
so they wanted to have a marriage.”

14:53.360 --> 14:56.600
But you could just have a registered marriage, finish it off.

14:56.840 --> 15:01.880
Why do you want to go to a church, where all dead bodies are buried?

15:03.800 --> 15:08.040
To get back some of them on your heads?

15:08.960 --> 15:11.080
So we have to be prepared to

15:11.320 --> 15:16.080
give up all the shackles of nonsense from our heads.

15:16.840 --> 15:21.760
All kinds of things there are, so much of conditionings

15:22.280 --> 15:25.200
come down even to the colour scheme,

15:25.480 --> 15:28.880
then it's all conditioning.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.840
This is too much, not good!

15:33.200 --> 15:34.920
All funny, funny ideas

15:35.120 --> 15:38.440
and anything funny and nonsensical that comes up,

15:38.680 --> 15:41.480
such funny brains picks it up.

15:41.680 --> 15:46.520
The other day I was telling a lady about her food,

15:46.880 --> 15:51.440
that a new idea has come that you should not eat any salt and sugar,

15:51.720 --> 15:54.440
I mean just imagine!

15:54.680 --> 15:58.560
Salt is so important for our breathing.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.840
If you ask any doctor, I mean,

16:01.040 --> 16:04.080
I don't know what's happening to the doctors!

16:04.480 --> 16:08.960
And sugar is so important for our combustion.

16:09.240 --> 16:13.960
But anybody says anything you people just jump at it

16:14.200 --> 16:18.240
and you people just try to be

16:19.640 --> 16:23.000
impressed by all these ideas,

16:25.360 --> 16:28.960
and start torturing yourself.

16:29.640 --> 16:34.480
Last but not the least I feel now,

16:34.920 --> 16:38.720
I've seen the program on Gnostic,

16:38.960 --> 16:41.920
Gnostic  g-n-o.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.080
And I was thinking, it comes from where g-n-o?

16:46.360 --> 16:50.920
In Sanskrit language 'gnya', 'gnya' we call it.

16:51.200 --> 16:57.560
We call it gnya or gya, anyway, that means 'to know'.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.560
Gnostics means the one who knew.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.880
When St. Thomas came to India, He came via Egypt

17:05.080 --> 17:07.720
and He wrote all about it, what is to know.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.120
And He said, it's a personal experience of everyone,

17:11.320 --> 17:14.440
just He described all Sahaja Yoga there.

17:14.640 --> 17:19.280
And also He said, why should God make you suffer?

17:19.480 --> 17:22.480
He is the most loving and affectionate father,

17:22.680 --> 17:26.520
blasting all ideas of Christianity.

17:27.680 --> 17:31.640
Also so many Hindus believe like that, Muslims believe like that,

17:31.840 --> 17:34.840
that you must suffer.

17:35.800 --> 17:42.840
So now somehow or other the exposure of the truth is also coming up,

17:43.720 --> 17:48.200
and also there is a kind of a turmoil going on,

17:48.480 --> 17:55.440
a kind, I would say a tremendous dynamic effects

17:55.960 --> 17:58.560
are seen on human mind today,

17:58.760 --> 18:02.960
that it starts thinking: 'What is this?'

18:04.720 --> 18:07.600
And you are the answer.

18:08.080 --> 18:13.080
You are the one who is going to convince them.

18:14.600 --> 18:18.560
As somebody was saying that, “Mother, why not we make every year

18:18.760 --> 18:23.000
as a great year of propagation of Sahaja Yoga,

18:23.240 --> 18:26.280
propaganda of Sahaja Yoga, (Hindi word)?”

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
I said, alright. You want to make a year,

18:30.200 --> 18:32.200
by that if something happens, let us have.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.960
But like our five-year plan in India

18:35.160 --> 18:37.720
I don't want to do all the documentation

18:37.920 --> 18:42.560
and write files and files and files, nothing comes out.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.960
But today if you decide that

18:48.160 --> 18:51.760
we are the ones who have to manifest this greatness on this Earth.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.200
We are the ones who have to do all this.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.320
How can we be weak people? How can we be possessed people?

18:58.520 --> 19:00.600
How can we be fussy people?

19:00.800 --> 19:06.000
How can we be the people who are not saints?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.920
We have to come out of all our pettiness, all our conditionings

19:13.240 --> 19:15.320
and of all the things of our ego,

19:15.560 --> 19:21.280
but not to fight it but through meditation, through witness state.

19:21.520 --> 19:25.320
You have to be the witness now you are travelling.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.520
When you are travelling, normally the witness state

19:28.720 --> 19:31.520
is how to criticize something.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.680
They never see the good points, they'll say, “Oh, look at that,

19:34.880 --> 19:36.920
this colour should not have been used,

19:37.120 --> 19:39.440
that's not good, that's not good.”

19:39.680 --> 19:43.480
What is good is to be seen,

19:43.880 --> 19:48.560
what is good in you, how much good you can have

19:48.880 --> 19:53.400
and what is good in other people.

19:53.680 --> 19:59.320
This time I am telling you that on your way, on your tour,

19:59.680 --> 20:02.960
I hope you will all enjoy it very much more

20:03.360 --> 20:07.480
and you’ll feel the manifestation of your Spirit,

20:07.720 --> 20:11.040
all around you, within you

20:11.320 --> 20:13.960
and in other people.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.080
May God bless you.

20:18.079 --> 20:20.351
Now I was aware of it all

20:20.699 --> 20:21.695
That

20:21.719 --> 20:23.195
One very big

20:23.703 --> 20:25.703
Revolution is happening

20:26.123 --> 20:27.821
And that's about it to London

20:27.996 --> 20:29.276
I had very big lecture in London

20:30.172 --> 20:31.686
That revolution slowly

20:32.099 --> 20:33.926
It was happening
in a good manner

20:34.671 --> 20:37.111
But today she is
coming to your aid

20:38.611 --> 20:42.424
She stands in your head
and you are her opponent

20:44.066 --> 20:45.166
If anyone

20:46.138 --> 20:47.190
Became a Hindu

20:47.214 --> 20:49.761
So he takes the saffron
flag and goes to rent it

20:51.443 --> 20:52.461
If anyone

20:56.016 --> 20:57.818
Buddha became

20:58.008 --> 21:02.460
Know the Buddha

21:04.499 --> 21:07.534
The Buddha who received the light

21:08.280 --> 21:11.849
But the one who considers us
Buddha takes on another flag

21:13.317 --> 21:15.020
But in Sahajayoga

21:15.591 --> 21:17.591
He does not go out
with any flags.

21:19.607 --> 21:21.090
It has its own focus.

21:23.169 --> 21:27.571
Now our first focus in India
is, 'My wife is not okay.

21:29.245 --> 21:31.245
My son has no job.

21:32.341 --> 21:36.009
My son has no job.

21:37.611 --> 21:38.928
and

21:40.436 --> 21:43.492
After we left, our eyes were,

21:46.721 --> 21:49.839
You start looking around,

21:49.864 --> 21:51.864
So those eyes can see

21:52.903 --> 21:55.863
That is what we have
been doing till date

21:56.411 --> 21:57.407
How much it

21:59.565 --> 22:01.267
How poorly it is made.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.634
What a sight!

22:04.412 --> 22:06.020
where is our focous

22:07.115 --> 22:10.403
how can be so
comfortebal in such away

22:12.101 --> 22:12.717
Are you

22:13.169 --> 22:16.425
Yes, who wants to spread the
shadow all over the world

22:17.139 --> 22:20.485
And for all the world to enjoy,

22:21.461 --> 22:25.068
What kind of lights do they use!

22:27.710 --> 22:30.615
Just like the big light
houses on the sea,

22:31.122 --> 22:35.056
how can we do so
easily without you ?

22:36.612 --> 22:39.267
But there is also so little of it

22:40.409 --> 22:43.342
And sometimes I am very surprised
to see that insignificance.

22:45.682 --> 22:48.014
As I said to you
today, I tell you,

22:48.864 --> 22:52.108
That, for the sake of
marriage, girls or boys said,

22:52.369 --> 22:55.124
I want a girl only

22:55.615 --> 22:57.615
Only Maratha's
son should be seen

22:59.218 --> 23:02.211
then what will happen
when he freez ?

23:05.433 --> 23:08.267
Yours! Then, 'Mataji,
this is what happened and that's it

23:08.324 --> 23:09.418
Back to another cry

23:13.100 --> 23:15.956
Then our hope is Mataji
we cannot leave fast

23:16.852 --> 23:17.985
Then Die without food

23:19.826 --> 23:21.272
Why should you tell me

23:22.256 --> 23:27.573
I believe it is best to
be comfortable in a meal.

23:27.620 --> 23:28.979
what is fasting ?

23:29.566 --> 23:32.816
There is a snake, or a
scorpion, that rode on a limb

23:35.888 --> 23:38.434
Such trivial ones

23:39.005 --> 23:41.005
And extremely compressed

23:41.831 --> 23:44.418
Today people of our
country can make

23:44.418 --> 23:47.504
progress evenin
sahajayoga due to tendency

23:47.877 --> 23:51.296
These people say, you are a saint.
Because you are so naive

23:51.321 --> 23:56.177
Such is their opinion. There will be.
You mean I have no disagreement.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.127
But Sahayogi is simply
naive and does not work.

24:02.928 --> 24:07.000
First, we need wisdom and
understanding that we have today

24:07.349 --> 24:08.860
Standing on the edge

24:13.241 --> 24:15.241
These petty ideas.

24:15.527 --> 24:18.500
If we want to get married,
we will do it in our

24:18.525 --> 24:21.436
we are sahajayogi By the way,
we are comfortable with sahajayogi

24:21.729 --> 24:23.885
Will work The word 'walk'
is too much for you.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.280
ok anything will work .
so which are you ?

24:26.305 --> 24:28.325
which king you are,says
everything will work out!

24:29.817 --> 24:32.718
But the word 'walk'
should go smoothly.

24:33.702 --> 24:34.816
What is going on ?

24:37.061 --> 24:40.537
Instead of saying
'okay' or 'okay,'

24:41.331 --> 24:43.331
isn't this all shivaji maharaj ?

24:47.108 --> 24:49.179
Let us take a look at
these things and see

24:49.179 --> 24:51.950
That we have come to Sahajayoga

24:51.951 --> 24:54.052
It's not just for selfish reasons

24:54.711 --> 24:57.682
That is what we came
to find ourselves

24:57.979 --> 25:00.142
For what the mothers
have given to the mother

25:00.167 --> 25:02.282
That we should open
our hands to others

25:04.806 --> 25:07.882
And we should see that
people should enjoy it

25:08.953 --> 25:10.440
They should be given love

25:11.559 --> 25:13.858
But people with
narrow-mindedness

25:14.159 --> 25:19.256
How to cure, then go into the pain
of fun in the room, Mataji Maja

25:19.499 --> 25:20.658
Pain in hand

25:21.213 --> 25:22.134
Will happen

25:23.483 --> 25:25.282
I got a job

25:25.392 --> 25:27.004
The hour went by

25:27.559 --> 25:28.745
Will happen

25:30.681 --> 25:34.035
Do you deserve to be under
the umbrella of your mother?

25:35.599 --> 25:36.434
Think about it

25:37.156 --> 25:39.156
Those fine ideas

25:39.608 --> 25:44.418
And apart from the contractions,
today I believe you are in the desert

25:46.164 --> 25:48.652
If you are wondering whether
fresh baked vegetables

25:48.677 --> 25:51.116
have been cooked in the
house, then it will be hard

25:54.044 --> 25:56.044
That's your wackiness

25:57.162 --> 26:00.221
Increased views and hours
are mind-blowingly great

26:02.181 --> 26:04.735
You belong to this
religion of that religion

26:04.854 --> 26:06.505
We are not of any religion

26:08.290 --> 26:09.552
Religion is ours

26:15.607 --> 26:17.344
We belong to no one's religion

26:17.630 --> 26:20.656
We are yogis what religion
do we mother to religion

26:20.712 --> 26:23.594
With a bit of it those
who are practicing this

26:23.935 --> 26:25.731
Let the days of
snake-eating come now

26:26.437 --> 26:28.831
Diagnostics Let
Your Kids Have Fun

26:31.593 --> 26:33.593
Many styling your

26:33.957 --> 26:36.290
Cut out the bad ideas.

26:39.591 --> 26:42.780
Unless you eliminate
those petty ideas

26:43.700 --> 26:44.655
by then

26:46.369 --> 26:50.915
If a kite is tie with
stone, it cannot fly

26:52.391 --> 26:53.524
Your flight

26:55.015 --> 26:55.810
Could not happen

26:57.206 --> 26:58.203
Just like our lives

26:58.806 --> 26:59.997
We are done

27:01.131 --> 27:02.096
In all

27:02.952 --> 27:04.281
In terms of content

27:05.170 --> 27:06.371
Sahajayoga  stands.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.257
And your All

27:10.876 --> 27:12.876
The kingdom of God is brought.

27:13.939 --> 27:15.939
But it should be
worth sitting there.

27:17.128 --> 27:18.850
Thoughts should be independent

27:19.358 --> 27:23.180
Thinking that I got into
this clan I thought something

27:23.362 --> 27:25.362
Maratha of 96 clan

27:25.552 --> 27:27.098
Or I become brahmin

27:29.011 --> 27:31.011
Content is all over us

27:33.131 --> 27:34.060
liar again.

27:34.289 --> 27:35.242
With credit

27:36.837 --> 27:38.837
Ashamed of sahajayogi

27:40.781 --> 27:42.234
I am sahajayogi

27:42.670 --> 27:43.966
I'm free.

27:44.735 --> 27:47.961
I'm on the alert.
You told me something

27:48.583 --> 27:49.985
And I'm not gonna do it

27:50.739 --> 27:52.739
I stand at liberty

27:53.112 --> 27:55.112
I have autocorrect enabled

27:55.405 --> 27:57.018
You don't teach me anything

28:01.668 --> 28:03.827
Get away from all relations

28:04.755 --> 28:08.942
You will not be able to come up
like lotus until you swallow it all

28:09.521 --> 28:13.154
Until then your anything
No use and no fun

28:18.336 --> 28:20.336
Now, if we have a
campaign like this

28:23.844 --> 28:28.749
In Pune, Come at Savarkar Statue

28:30.757 --> 28:31.921
so what you do there ?

28:35.039 --> 28:36.600
So there were
thousands of people

28:37.965 --> 28:39.310
Unpleasantness

28:39.817 --> 28:40.845
If you want to teach

28:40.845 --> 28:43.095
Thousands of people will leave

28:43.304 --> 28:44.696
Run away

28:45.363 --> 28:46.944
Because there is Unpleasantness

28:49.269 --> 28:51.269
But in the court of love

28:52.062 --> 28:54.062
Get rid of it all.

28:54.356 --> 28:59.233
It is not ready.
All of this wears off in the dirt

29:03.684 --> 29:05.684
By breaking into this paradigm

29:07.248 --> 29:09.248
Stand in Sahajayoga

29:10.080 --> 29:11.592
It should not weak

29:12.830 --> 29:14.467
It should be strong

29:15.554 --> 29:16.549
This is new

29:17.049 --> 29:19.049
Such people should
be raised today

29:19.763 --> 29:23.730
thousands of mahatma gandhi
Thousands of lenin were raised

29:27.169 --> 29:29.854
thousands of like Abraham Lincoln
were raise like People should say

29:31.219 --> 29:32.803
But there is no difference

29:34.009 --> 29:36.679
That is what the nose,
the mouth and the feet are like

29:37.702 --> 29:39.702
Just look at how far the
soul has reached the light

29:42.424 --> 29:46.571
And we are saints,
we are saints.

29:47.602 --> 29:49.602
All this is a disorder

29:51.046 --> 29:53.046
It's a stigma for us

29:53.712 --> 29:58.866
We will break it down,religion and
all and forget about everything

30:00.143 --> 30:02.252
Unless you decide to

30:02.665 --> 30:04.665
You will not benefit at
all in the sahajayoga

30:05.259 --> 30:07.259
And for us too, it's Trouble

30:11.052 --> 30:12.486
Let's get bigger

30:13.557 --> 30:15.557
The sea went anywhere

30:15.961 --> 30:17.316
That nobody is in the mind

30:17.760 --> 30:20.471
That is our sea of Alibaug

30:22.249 --> 30:23.847
or is a Mumbai sea

30:24.902 --> 30:26.508
The ocean is ocean

30:26.865 --> 30:28.464
Such a saint is a saint

30:29.701 --> 30:31.395
Which is a sign of saint and

30:32.029 --> 30:34.946
The main symptom of this
is that apprehension

30:35.400 --> 30:36.813
Artificial

30:37.845 --> 30:41.095
Beyond the artificial
small shrines

30:42.032 --> 30:43.232
Their vision is relaxed

30:43.882 --> 30:45.233
Very endearing

30:48.185 --> 30:53.113
At that time as a call for
cooperation, the whole world refuses

30:53.914 --> 30:55.576
The key is how we
become what you are

30:57.623 --> 30:59.623
We are gonna do
whatever you want

31:00.432 --> 31:02.924
We are this we are that

31:03.844 --> 31:05.333
Who are you lets see

31:06.515 --> 31:08.515
So what do we do

31:10.745 --> 31:13.427
Just get rid of this
illusion of stupidity

31:14.594 --> 31:16.594
You can remove
this with kundalini

31:17.046 --> 31:20.014
Today they are cheearing
me for Adi Shakti ,so do it

31:21.323 --> 31:23.844
What happen with it but
what is the benefit.

31:27.002 --> 31:28.349
If ours

31:28.928 --> 31:30.003
In cheers

31:31.073 --> 31:32.527
You forget all

31:33.225 --> 31:35.225
Are under our mother's feet

31:36.058 --> 31:38.227
And this universe is made by her

31:39.417 --> 31:43.796
We are special sahajayogi
from that world

31:44.431 --> 31:46.035
If you think about it

31:47.209 --> 31:49.209
Then your own
perception will change

31:49.812 --> 31:50.993
And about self

31:51.476 --> 31:53.226
Whichever is wrong ideas

31:53.583 --> 31:54.942
they fix it

31:55.291 --> 31:56.498
Among themselves

31:57.157 --> 31:57.921
love

31:59.373 --> 32:02.662
Not only that, but huge power

32:03.916 --> 32:05.682
One is living among themselves

32:06.023 --> 32:06.764
Be aware of that

32:07.597 --> 32:09.597
And we with a great power

32:09.843 --> 32:11.237
Come together

32:11.602 --> 32:12.874
And with this power

32:13.318 --> 32:15.318
You will notice that
We are about to be saved

32:18.632 --> 32:21.887
Today some hindi language
known people who has come so

32:22.106 --> 32:28.111
I always told to Marathi people
That you try to learn Hindi

32:28.111 --> 32:31.099
Because its your
national language but

32:31.099 --> 32:32.602
Will have to say to
Hindi people also

32:32.603 --> 32:35.609
Is it good to learn
a little Marathi

32:35.609 --> 32:41.357
Although I think that The Marathi
language is a bit too powerful

32:41.357 --> 32:46.354
And its depth can not come in
any language okey leave Sanskrit

32:46.378 --> 32:49.859
After this any
Colloquial language has

32:49.859 --> 32:56.477
For Kundalini Marathi language
is very smooth and very

32:59.732 --> 33:01.069
In use

33:01.356 --> 33:04.672
However, the place of
Hindi language is very high

33:04.697 --> 33:07.855
and ever Marathi people
should know Hindi language

33:07.855 --> 33:09.986
Similarly, you people also
have a Marathi Language

33:10.010 --> 33:11.858
learning should not be difficult

33:11.859 --> 33:15.855
What am I talking about today

33:15.855 --> 33:18.605
That of the big revolution
We stand on the post

33:18.605 --> 33:24.603
Right now in front of us
It is a big request that

33:25.296 --> 33:29.546
We are sahajayogi
Have earned yoga

33:29.859 --> 33:36.603
we are not like that Which
are full of dirty thoughts

33:36.603 --> 33:39.305
Who do not love each other

33:39.329 --> 33:43.553
and one Have violent
tendencies towards each other

33:43.605 --> 33:48.102
We are yogis We gonna
join all over the world

33:48.102 --> 33:52.357
We are especially representative

33:52.357 --> 33:57.916
And we are saints and the
characteristics of saints

33:57.916 --> 34:01.169
Its in us Must seen

34:01.356 --> 34:04.656
When it show everyone

34:04.656 --> 34:07.653
It will be understood that
Sahaja Yoga is a special thing

34:08.129 --> 34:10.605
Otherwise people will think
that your sahajayogi then what?

34:10.605 --> 34:13.360
Your habits are the same
Your ways are the same

34:13.360 --> 34:17.856
You fight likewise The
group bet is the same in you

34:17.856 --> 34:20.358
All your values
Like that of others

34:20.358 --> 34:23.358
So what about Sahaja Yoga?

34:23.358 --> 34:27.857
In Sahaja Yoga we have
externally Received nothing

34:27.857 --> 34:32.355
But the strong power
inside We live in

34:32.759 --> 34:38.256
And all our world
have this power today

34:38.256 --> 34:42.258
See that The power is
inhabited by all of us.

34:42.258 --> 34:48.753
It is roaming inside us Her
beautiful environment inside

34:48.753 --> 34:51.236
Made up and mutual
love and we know

34:51.583 --> 34:58.832
Not so much, every
moment, Power feeds us

34:58.832 --> 35:01.979
Binds us to each other

35:02.090 --> 35:06.225
This power is the formula of
the whole world that we got

35:06.225 --> 35:11.723
And when we found it We
do such useless things

35:11.723 --> 35:17.227
Of course Ready to destroy life

35:17.432 --> 35:22.931
We have to evaluate ourselves Will
have to know what is our value

35:22.931 --> 35:26.687
And what did we
understand our life

35:28.689 --> 35:30.436
I see that

35:30.436 --> 35:33.433
To quarrel is a human nature

35:33.433 --> 35:35.932
Whatever happens to
him They start fighting

35:35.932 --> 35:39.183
Like this with dog
cat I am not even seen

35:39.685 --> 35:42.184
If anything happens It
becomes a matter of quarrel

35:42.184 --> 35:47.435
Even if love is something
Sahaja Yoga is only for love

35:48.684 --> 35:52.524
Movement just love movement

35:52.548 --> 35:55.278
And you are sitting
in the same movement

35:55.686 --> 36:03.436
A very beautiful and very sweet
This is the environment I travel to

36:04.918 --> 36:09.664
But it can happen when
your subtlety Be so deep

36:10.039 --> 36:16.288
That we can see that we are
representative of divine

36:16.908 --> 36:20.905
Divine doing this job
from us What a great thing

36:21.034 --> 36:23.536
To achieve this unique thing

36:23.536 --> 36:29.534
You need to be aware of yourself
Be and be your own personality

36:29.534 --> 36:33.254
Give her such a
huge strain Tease

36:33.254 --> 36:37.283
Today is the first day
When everyone has come

36:37.283 --> 36:41.784
See how well everyone is sitting It is
a matter of great pride for a mother.

36:41.784 --> 36:44.784
That all my children here
are gathered from the world

36:47.037 --> 36:53.033
But every time I want
that you become aware

36:53.033 --> 36:56.285
You have to know that Mother
is doing very big revolution

37:10.971 --> 37:12.527
You guys

37:13.606 --> 37:15.606
Watch you wake up

37:16.042 --> 37:18.042
That our mother

37:18.097 --> 37:19.487
That is a very big achievement

37:20.161 --> 37:22.161
Which will wipe out all the universe

37:23.272 --> 37:25.804
This is a very big achievement

37:26.502 --> 37:28.502
Is doing and you

37:28.795 --> 37:30.396
We are in limbo.

37:32.148 --> 37:37.233
May god bless you
