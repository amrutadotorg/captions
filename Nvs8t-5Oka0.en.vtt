00:08.960 --> 00:12.880
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

00:27.480 --> 00:38.160
What is attention, what is the movement of attention

00:38.280 --> 00:47.920
and what are the ways and methods of raising our attention.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.760
Keep it in broad ways. Alright?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.800
But when I am saying all these things

00:55.920 --> 00:58.720
you must know that I am talking to you individually

00:58.840 --> 01:00.360
– it’s not about others.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.680
Always the first thing human beings do is, when I am speaking to you,

01:05.800 --> 01:09.720
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

01:09.840 --> 01:14.119
This is the best way of putting your attention onto something else.

01:14.239 --> 01:16.852
If you put your attention to yourself that,

01:16.973 --> 01:19.759
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

01:19.880 --> 01:24.480
then it will have an effect, because these [words of mine] are mantras.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.400
And that’s why it is wasted

01:27.520 --> 01:32.400
because whatever is given to you is thrown onto another person.

01:33.200 --> 01:42.640
So the attention, that you have, is the only way to know the reality.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.200
Your own attention is important,

01:46.320 --> 01:49.560
not the attention of others or your attention on others!

01:49.680 --> 01:52.000
This must be clearly understood.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.280
If you understand this point that the whole thing

01:55.400 --> 01:58.160
is to be consumed by you,

01:58.280 --> 02:02.320
through your attention to raise yourself to a higher situation,

02:02.440 --> 02:05.000
it will work out. Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

02:05.120 --> 02:07.280
and going to another person who is getting nourished,

02:07.400 --> 02:08.800
while you are getting nothing.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.360
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

02:13.480 --> 02:17.600
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing it to that person.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.200
So today, as I am going to speak to you about attention,

02:21.320 --> 02:27.960
you should know that your attention should absorb all that I am saying.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.440
It is not meant for anybody else.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.480
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s the best way,

02:34.600 --> 02:39.000
so that it goes into you. Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.400
That you listen to me has no effect.

02:41.520 --> 02:48.160
Every lecture will transform you because, after all, I am speaking.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.800
But because you always think of others

02:51.920 --> 02:54.160
and you think of your problems all the time

02:54.440 --> 02:58.280
– something nonsensical is going on, about which you are worried –

02:58.400 --> 03:00.440
and the attention is so overloaded

03:00.560 --> 03:04.040
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go into you.

03:04.160 --> 03:08.120
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive and knowing

03:08.240 --> 03:12.200
that all these nonsensical things have no value.

03:12.320 --> 03:17.280
It’s your attention that has to come up and has to grow.

03:22.760 --> 03:36.680
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of your being

03:36.800 --> 03:40.360
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

03:40.480 --> 03:44.880
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.640
How much you have gone into it, how much you have discovered it,

03:48.760 --> 03:53.640
how far you have raised it is a different point.

03:56.040 --> 04:02.880
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.280
How far your attention has been enlightened is a different point.

04:08.400 --> 04:13.280
But your attention is God

04:16.520 --> 04:21.960
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.560
It is like a canvas.

04:25.680 --> 04:31.840
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread out for a film,

04:32.960 --> 04:36.339
and whatever aptitudes

04:36.460 --> 04:41.160
or, you can say, the drags or movements, your attention has,

04:41.280 --> 04:45.320
shows on that canvas.

04:46.360 --> 04:51.880
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’ in English language.

04:52.440 --> 04:58.520
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone to, or his attention is dragged to

04:58.640 --> 05:02.160
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like that in English language – vritti.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.000
Can you suggest any word?

05:06.680 --> 05:15.760
So our attention is just a pure, completely pure canvas

05:17.000 --> 05:23.120
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have, to begin with.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.760
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

05:27.880 --> 05:33.400
one from your past, one from your future sense and one from the present.

05:37.520 --> 05:44.440
Now, whatever have been your experiences about

05:44.560 --> 05:49.600
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

05:50.080 --> 05:56.720
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.400
For example, if you see the black colour:

06:01.800 --> 06:07.640
all that goes with the black colour is recorded in your memory.

06:07.760 --> 06:14.680
As soon as you see this black colour, quite a lot of it comes up.

06:16.120 --> 06:22.640
That means, as soon as you see this with your attention,

06:22.760 --> 06:28.000
the attention gets muddled up, or you can say the attention gets coloured

06:28.120 --> 06:32.760
with all the memories about this black colour.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.778
And then your action takes place

06:37.899 --> 06:43.149
according to the way your attention is affected.

06:45.480 --> 06:52.480
For example, just now something was burned by these flames.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.000
Now, all of you became aware of it.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.800
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

07:00.920 --> 07:05.440
first thing [that] will happen will be that you will be cautious about it.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.480
It is not going to happen again,

07:07.600 --> 07:10.560
but the whole memory will come to you

07:10.680 --> 07:15.240
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

07:15.360 --> 07:21.080
because your attention will become aware of that

07:21.200 --> 07:28.240
as soon as you will see that, because that canvas of your attention

07:28.360 --> 07:34.640
itself will start throwing out these pictures, out of itself,

07:34.760 --> 07:39.520
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

07:39.640 --> 07:44.560
This is a living canvas.

07:45.440 --> 07:54.200
Or may be that if you have got some ideas which you have premeditated,

07:54.320 --> 07:59.160
or thought of, of the future.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.240
For example, you must have thought of somebody that,

08:02.360 --> 08:05.840
“If I meet that man I will tell him like this.”

08:05.960 --> 08:09.567
As soon as you will meet that man,

08:09.688 --> 08:14.320
your attention will start bubbling out with those ideas

08:14.440 --> 08:16.518
that are coming about this man,

08:16.639 --> 08:18.800
and you will start addressing to him accordingly.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.840
It’s all stored up within you,

08:20.960 --> 08:24.480
whether it is about the future or about the past.

08:24.600 --> 08:32.320
It’s given out of the attention through that bubbling process

08:32.760 --> 08:36.880
which depends on your dragging nature, where are you dragged.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.160
That’s called as vritti, but I don’t know what you call it in English language.

08:41.280 --> 08:45.440
I do not know what is the, what you are prone to (tendency).

08:46.280 --> 08:49.960
Vritti is a very neutral word. It doesn’t mean anything bad.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.280
It means where you are drawn to.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.280
Vritti means a temperament by which you are drawn to.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.520
And whatever is your temperament, it acts like that.

08:59.640 --> 09:07.040
For example, if you see a man walking, say, blindly

09:07.160 --> 09:09.680
– he cannot see things –

09:09.800 --> 09:13.360
one person may get angry with that person,

09:13.480 --> 09:16.160
another may have pity for that person,

09:16.280 --> 09:19.680
third may come forward to help him out.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.640
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

09:21.760 --> 09:26.360
that you have developed through your three gunas.

09:29.640 --> 09:37.600
That’s why this attention becomes identified with you.

09:37.840 --> 09:46.000
And when you are identified with this, your vritti, your temperaments,

09:46.160 --> 09:53.800
then you are still in a misidentified area.

09:53.920 --> 10:00.320
Let us take a case of somebody who has been possessed before.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.840
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession goes away.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.640
But the memory remains in the brain that he was possessed.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.720
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person, left side is stronger,

10:16.840 --> 10:20.480
then that memory lingers on,

10:20.600 --> 10:24.880
and as soon as that person comes in contact with anyone

10:25.000 --> 10:30.080
which has got something to do with the past possession, it clicks.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.320
And the whole thing starts coming into you bubbling out

10:33.440 --> 10:37.040
and you think you are again possessed.

10:38.360 --> 10:43.040
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction]. It’s a myth.

10:44.320 --> 10:48.600
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you are again possessed!”

10:48.720 --> 10:53.480
Because your left side is weak, means you always live in your memory.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.960
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

10:57.080 --> 11:00.703
If you could make yourself stronger than your memory,

11:00.824 --> 11:02.951
nothing can possess you.

11:09.880 --> 11:16.080
But after you get your Realisation,

11:16.200 --> 11:22.120
you are not still identified with that state of mind

11:22.600 --> 11:28.480
in which you see your ego and superego as myths.

11:31.280 --> 11:36.120
Still you get caught up into your ego and superego,

11:36.240 --> 11:42.120
and that’s why your attention is still in a mess.

11:43.560 --> 11:49.440
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent child,

11:51.560 --> 11:54.840
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

11:54.960 --> 11:59.120
means in actual experiencing of something – for a child –

11:59.240 --> 12:01.240
because he has no memory.

12:01.360 --> 12:07.680
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that this burns.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.360
He has to touch something cold to know that it is cold.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.680
His memory is not yet built up.

12:13.960 --> 12:22.240
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

12:23.640 --> 12:28.680
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.200
And once the memory is built up stronger,

12:31.320 --> 12:35.480
the whole personality is affected by memory.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.000
All the conditioning of all kinds come through that;

12:40.120 --> 12:45.880
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can come to you.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.240
You see, sometimes you smell a particular soap,

12:50.360 --> 12:52.880
or say a rose, you smell it –

12:53.000 --> 12:57.680
then all the memories of smelling such a rose, sometimes,

12:57.800 --> 13:00.520
comes to you and you may feel really elated sometimes,

13:00.640 --> 13:02.720
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very unhappy,

13:02.840 --> 13:05.840
whatever may be the situation.

13:05.960 --> 13:10.160
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.480
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.120
has given you a memory.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.880
This memory might have given you a superego,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.960
or might have given you a ego.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.600
This scanning might have taken place.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.440
If it has been a ego and a superego,

13:30.560 --> 13:35.360
then may be that, if it was ego you must have felt happy.

13:35.480 --> 13:40.280
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very happy.

13:40.400 --> 13:44.280
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are suppressed by this,

13:44.400 --> 13:46.280
then you feel very unhappy.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.120
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

13:49.240 --> 13:54.600
are the states where you are still in the myth,

13:55.480 --> 13:59.560
still the myth exists. You have to still go beyond.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.520
So if you feel happy about some situation, you should know you

14:02.640 --> 14:06.200
are only happy before Realisation,

14:06.320 --> 14:12.400
because it is giving some support to your ego to bloat.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.800
And if you are unhappy, then you should know that

14:17.920 --> 14:21.400
there is some sort of a suppression on your ego

14:21.520 --> 14:23.840
and there’s a superego developing.

14:23.960 --> 14:30.880
So both the situations have been of no help to you,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.400
of no help to you for your growth,

14:35.520 --> 14:39.680
except that both these institutions develop so much

14:39.800 --> 14:46.480
that you are away from the real experiencing.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.360
The real experiencing stops

14:51.480 --> 14:56.680
because your attention is so much muddled up.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.680
So on one side if you move – on the left hand side –

15:03.320 --> 15:09.560
your attention is muddled up with fear, with pain,

15:09.680 --> 15:19.600
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

15:21.520 --> 15:27.440
The other side, if you indulge too much on to the right hand side

15:27.560 --> 15:29.360
– little bit also –

15:29.480 --> 15:37.440
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

15:39.160 --> 15:45.600
The colour of the left side is blue.

15:45.720 --> 15:50.320
And the blue colour starts changing to the black.

15:51.120 --> 15:57.760
While on the right hand side it is, to begin with, yellow,

15:57.880 --> 16:00.360
light yellow or you can say golden,

16:00.480 --> 16:04.720
then yellow, then orange and then red.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.480
So you go to aggression on the right hand side.

16:08.600 --> 16:16.200
On the left hand side you go into a complete state of

16:17.240 --> 16:18.600
entropy, you can call it,

16:18.720 --> 16:22.640
or a state where you are separated from yourself

16:22.760 --> 16:26.120
into a complete frozen state.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.480
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

16:28.600 --> 16:32.240
on the other side you become completely heated up.

16:33.920 --> 16:40.760
Both these things are, again, movement on the wrong direction.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.320
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

16:44.440 --> 16:49.560
– that you keep your attention more in the centre –

16:49.680 --> 16:56.480
there also, because it’s a very sensitive point, it doesn’t stay there.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.120
For example,

16:59.680 --> 17:06.200
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for burning the house.

17:06.600 --> 17:11.280
In the same way we can use it for creating smoke.

17:11.400 --> 17:16.960
But we can also use this fire in its proper way, if we use it,

17:17.080 --> 17:22.640
in its proper proportion, for cooking the food [or] for giving us light.

17:22.760 --> 17:28.880
If it is too much, it can burn like a big fire.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.200
But in the center when you know how to balance it,

17:36.320 --> 17:38.760
then you can use it for your own purpose

17:38.880 --> 17:46.000
– for cooking or for giving light, and then for a puja too.

17:47.920 --> 17:57.200
So in the same way when we really balance our gunas properly,

17:57.440 --> 18:03.200
then we become gradually the master of the whole situation.
