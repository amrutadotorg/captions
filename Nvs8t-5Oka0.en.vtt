00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.880
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:38.160
What is attention, what is the movement of attention

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.920
and what are the ways and methods of raising our attention.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.760
Keep it in broad ways. Alright?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800
But when I am saying all these things

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.720
you must know that I am talking to you individually

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.360
– it’s not about others.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.680
Always the first thing human beings do is, when I am speaking to you,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.720
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.119
This is the best way of putting your attention onto something else.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:16.852
If you put your attention to yourself that,

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:19.759
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.480
then it will have an effect, because these [words of mine] are mantras.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.400
And that’s why it is wasted

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.400
because whatever is given to you is thrown onto another person.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.640
So the attention, that you have, is the only way to know the reality.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.200
Your own attention is important,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.560
not the attention of others or your attention on others!

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.000
This must be clearly understood.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.280
If you understand this point that the whole thing

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.160
is to be consumed by you,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.320
through your attention to raise yourself to a higher situation,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.000
it will work out. Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.280
and going to another person who is getting nourished,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.800
while you are getting nothing.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.360
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.600
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing it to that person.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.200
So today, as I am going to speak to you about attention,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.960
you should know that your attention should absorb all that I am saying.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.440
It is not meant for anybody else.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.480
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s the best way,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.000
so that it goes into you. Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.400
That you listen to me has no effect.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.160
Every lecture will transform you because, after all, I am speaking.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.800
But because you always think of others

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.160
and you think of your problems all the time

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.280
– something nonsensical is going on, about which you are worried –

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.440
and the attention is so overloaded

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.040
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go into you.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.120
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive and knowing

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.200
that all these nonsensical things have no value.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.280
It’s your attention that has to come up and has to grow.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:36.680
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of your being

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.360
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.880
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.640
How much you have gone into it, how much you have discovered it,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.640
how far you have raised it is a different point.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.880
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.280
How far your attention has been enlightened is a different point.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.280
But your attention is God

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.960
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.560
It is like a canvas.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.840
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread out for a film,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.339
and whatever aptitudes

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.160
or, you can say, the drags or movements, your attention has,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.320
shows on that canvas.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.880
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’ in English language.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.520
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone to, or his attention is dragged to

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.160
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like that in English language – vritti.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.000
Can you suggest any word?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.760
So our attention is just a pure, completely pure canvas

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.120
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have, to begin with.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.760
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.400
one from your past, one from your future sense and one from the present.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.440
Now, whatever have been your experiences about

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.600
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.720
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.400
For example, if you see the black colour:

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.640
all that goes with the black colour is recorded in your memory.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.680
As soon as you see this black colour, quite a lot of it comes up.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.640
That means, as soon as you see this with your attention,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.000
the attention gets muddled up, or you can say the attention gets coloured

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.760
with all the memories about this black colour.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.778
And then your action takes place

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:43.149
according to the way your attention is affected.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.480
For example, just now something was burned by these flames.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.000
Now, all of you became aware of it.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.800
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.440
first thing [that] will happen will be that you will be cautious about it.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.480
It is not going to happen again,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.560
but the whole memory will come to you

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.240
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.080
because your attention will become aware of that

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.240
as soon as you will see that, because that canvas of your attention

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.640
itself will start throwing out these pictures, out of itself,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.520
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.560
This is a living canvas.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:54.200
Or may be that if you have got some ideas which you have premeditated,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.160
or thought of, of the future.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.240
For example, you must have thought of somebody that,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.840
“If I meet that man I will tell him like this.”

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.567
As soon as you will meet that man,

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:14.320
your attention will start bubbling out with those ideas

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.518
that are coming about this man,

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:18.800
and you will start addressing to him accordingly.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.840
It’s all stored up within you,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.480
whether it is about the future or about the past.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:32.320
It’s given out of the attention through that bubbling process

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.880
which depends on your dragging nature, where are you dragged.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.160
That’s called as vritti, but I don’t know what you call it in English language.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.440
I do not know what is the, what you are prone to (tendency).

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.960
Vritti is a very neutral word. It doesn’t mean anything bad.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.280
It means where you are drawn to.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.280
Vritti means a temperament by which you are drawn to.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.520
And whatever is your temperament, it acts like that.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:07.040
For example, if you see a man walking, say, blindly

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.680
– he cannot see things –

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.360
one person may get angry with that person,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.160
another may have pity for that person,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.680
third may come forward to help him out.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.640
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.360
that you have developed through your three gunas.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:37.600
That’s why this attention becomes identified with you.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:46.000
And when you are identified with this, your vritti, your temperaments,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:53.800
then you are still in a misidentified area.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.320
Let us take a case of somebody who has been possessed before.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.840
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession goes away.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.640
But the memory remains in the brain that he was possessed.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.720
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person, left side is stronger,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.480
then that memory lingers on,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.880
and as soon as that person comes in contact with anyone

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.080
which has got something to do with the past possession, it clicks.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.320
And the whole thing starts coming into you bubbling out

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.040
and you think you are again possessed.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.040
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction]. It’s a myth.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.600
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you are again possessed!”

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.480
Because your left side is weak, means you always live in your memory.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.960
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.703
If you could make yourself stronger than your memory,

00:11:00.824 --> 00:11:02.951
nothing can possess you.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:16.080
But after you get your Realisation,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.120
you are not still identified with that state of mind

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.480
in which you see your ego and superego as myths.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.120
Still you get caught up into your ego and superego,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.120
and that’s why your attention is still in a mess.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.440
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent child,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.840
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.120
means in actual experiencing of something – for a child –

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.240
because he has no memory.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.680
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that this burns.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.360
He has to touch something cold to know that it is cold.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.680
His memory is not yet built up.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:22.240
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.680
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200
And once the memory is built up stronger,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.480
the whole personality is affected by memory.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.000
All the conditioning of all kinds come through that;

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.880
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can come to you.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.240
You see, sometimes you smell a particular soap,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.880
or say a rose, you smell it –

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.680
then all the memories of smelling such a rose, sometimes,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.520
comes to you and you may feel really elated sometimes,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.720
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very unhappy,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.840
whatever may be the situation.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.160
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.480
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.120
has given you a memory.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.880
This memory might have given you a superego,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.960
or might have given you a ego.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.600
This scanning might have taken place.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.440
If it has been a ego and a superego,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:35.360
then may be that, if it was ego you must have felt happy.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.280
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very happy.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.280
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are suppressed by this,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.280
then you feel very unhappy.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.120
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.600
are the states where you are still in the myth,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.560
still the myth exists. You have to still go beyond.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.520
So if you feel happy about some situation, you should know you

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.200
are only happy before Realisation,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:12.400
because it is giving some support to your ego to bloat.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.800
And if you are unhappy, then you should know that

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.400
there is some sort of a suppression on your ego

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.840
and there’s a superego developing.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:30.880
So both the situations have been of no help to you,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.400
of no help to you for your growth,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.680
except that both these institutions develop so much

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:46.480
that you are away from the real experiencing.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.360
The real experiencing stops

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.680
because your attention is so much muddled up.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.680
So on one side if you move – on the left hand side –

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:09.560
your attention is muddled up with fear, with pain,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:19.600
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.440
The other side, if you indulge too much on to the right hand side

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.360
– little bit also –

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:37.440
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.600
The colour of the left side is blue.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.320
And the blue colour starts changing to the black.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:57.760
While on the right hand side it is, to begin with, yellow,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.360
light yellow or you can say golden,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.720
then yellow, then orange and then red.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.480
So you go to aggression on the right hand side.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:16.200
On the left hand side you go into a complete state of

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.600
entropy, you can call it,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.640
or a state where you are separated from yourself

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.120
into a complete frozen state.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.480
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.240
on the other side you become completely heated up.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:40.760
Both these things are, again, movement on the wrong direction.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.320
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.560
– that you keep your attention more in the centre –

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.480
there also, because it’s a very sensitive point, it doesn’t stay there.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.120
For example,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:06.200
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for burning the house.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:11.280
In the same way we can use it for creating smoke.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:16.960
But we can also use this fire in its proper way, if we use it,

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.640
in its proper proportion, for cooking the food [or] for giving us light.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:28.880
If it is too much, it can burn like a big fire.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.200
But in the center when you know how to balance it,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.760
then you can use it for your own purpose

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:46.000
– for cooking or for giving light, and then for a puja too.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:57.200
So in the same way when we really balance our gunas properly,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:03.200
then we become gradually the master of the whole situation.
