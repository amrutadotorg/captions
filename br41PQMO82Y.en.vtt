00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.590
Today we are going to celebrate

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.750
the Puja of Gauri.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.230
She came on this earth

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.990
many-a-times to kill the people

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
who were doing wrong things,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.310
who were trying to kill good people.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.030
She has done Her level to do that,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.070
and today we are celebrating Her birthday.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.830
You all know so much about it

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.790
that I need not tell you,

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.590
but what you have to know is that

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.430
She came on this earth to save you

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.350
from all kinds of troubles.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.990
For Her you were important, very important,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.110
because you were doing Devi Puja.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.630
And so we are celebrating today this Devi Puja,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.190
with all our heart,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.950
because whatever ill people did to you,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.750
She came to destroy them.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.350
So today is a very great day for you to thank Her,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.910
thank Her for Her protection and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.830
for Her understanding

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.430
as to what you have been tortured for.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.030
I'm happy you are all here to celebrate Her birthday,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.750
and to be surrendered to Her

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.030
so that She can always,

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.350
always protect you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.470
and give you Her blessings.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.550
So may God bless you all,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.990
your children,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.790
your families,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.630
and that you bring great joy and protection.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.550
It's very kind of you to have come today, so far away.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.830
I'm very happy to see you.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.550
Moreover, you have got tomorrow also

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.790
that you can celebrate.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.790
Today we are not going to have any questions and solutions;

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.150
we are just going to worship the Goddess, that's all,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.310
and request Her to protect us

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.950
from all kinds of problems that are facing us.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.510
Thank you very much.
