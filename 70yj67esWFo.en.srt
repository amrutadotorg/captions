1
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:16,650
Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

2
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,843
Sydney, Australia

3
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:24,837
April 4, 1981

4
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:12,329
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

5
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,372
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

6
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:23,260
This day has never been celebrated before

7
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:26,016
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

8
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:30,422
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

9
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:37,897
because this is the New Year’s Day

10
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,900
of the Shalivahan calendar.

11
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,393
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

12
00:06:45,594 --> 00:06:47,918
and they are called as Shalivahan

13
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:50,748
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

14
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,874
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

15
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:57,847
so many times My shawls around.

16
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:00,353
And they were called as Shalivahan.

17
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:09,269
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

18
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,474
the nine days there are.

19
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:20,964
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

20
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:26,280
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

21
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:30,942
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

22
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:35,296
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

23
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:42,225
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

24
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:46,746
when She incarnated on this Earth.

25
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:50,998
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

26
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,019
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

27
00:07:57,151 --> 00:08:10,673
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

28
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:14,069
just starting this week.

29
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,873
What is the day? The day today is …?

30
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:18,328
[Today’s the fourth.]

31
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,529
 Today ….

32
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,171
[Saturday, Mother.]

33
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,890
[Saturday.]

34
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:29,119
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

35
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,525
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

36
00:08:31,726 --> 00:08:34,437
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

37
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:37,405
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

38
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,740
and when you take My photograph

39
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,604
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

40
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:43,970
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

41
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,646
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

42
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:49,959
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

43
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,395
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

44
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:55,606
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

45
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,963
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

46
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:02,264
[Hindi]

47
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:16,729
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

48
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:23,404
and then the Goddess started working.

49
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:29,542
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

50
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:32,387
She started working out on Wednesday.

51
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,466
Wednesday is the action day,

52
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,257
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

53
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,634
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

54
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:47,202
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

55
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:54,014
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

56
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:58,738
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

57
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:03,343
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

58
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:06,136
Wednesday is the second day.

59
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:11,069
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

60
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,721
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

61
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:20,539
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

62
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,805
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

63
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:38,817
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

64
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:42,307
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

65
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,023
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

66
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:51,425
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

67
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:54,964
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

68
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:58,253
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

69
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,696
Venus.

70
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:06,261
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

71
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:11,727
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

72
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,863
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

73
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:28,356
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

74
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:35,013
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

75
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:38,815
is of realization, of integration.

76
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:44,183
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

77
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:49,618
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

78
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:52,025
you cannot understand Christianity.

79
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:56,038
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

80
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:59,078
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

81
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,474
then only you will understand what Christ said.

82
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:08,755
So today is the day of – first day –

83
00:12:08,956 --> 00:12:11,414
of when Ganesha was created,

84
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:18,750
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

85
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:24,553
but according to dates of the moon,

86
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:32,375
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

87
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,111
[Marathi]

88
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:38,186
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

89
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:40,120
And this is the time when –

90
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:43,801
[Marathi]

91
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:50,806
Gauri is the Chaitra.

92
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:53,224
So the establishment of the Gauri

93
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:56,112
is taken place during these nine days.

94
00:12:56,313 --> 00:13:00,247
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

95
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,776
Though first Gauri had to come,

96
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:08,375
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

97
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:12,617
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

98
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:19,166
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

99
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,153
nothing starts;

100
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,519
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

101
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,489
all the negativities,

102
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,199
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

103
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,142
all the attentions that are here and there.

104
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:37,878
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

105
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,834
just to ask Him to protect us.

106
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:42,797
But first the Gauri has to come,

107
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:47,844
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

108
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:54,977
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

109
00:13:55,178 --> 00:14:03,047
negativity, for people to transcend

110
00:14:03,248 --> 00:14:07,845
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

111
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:11,615
the maya, the illusion.

112
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:16,064
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

113
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:18,949
people used to obstruct

114
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,297
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

115
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:30,839
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

116
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,725
and the saints were separate;

117
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:36,723
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

118
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:40,204
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

119
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,587
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

120
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:46,626
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

121
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:49,220
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

122
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,636
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

123
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,482
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

124
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,304
so we are not absolute saints.

125
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:01,759
 And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

126
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,023
even when you are worshipping Me,

127
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:08,394
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

128
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:11,840
Try to be more on the saintly side.

129
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,320
Because you are saints, no doubt,

130
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:18,264
but these horrible things have somehow or other

131
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,873
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

132
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:24,783
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

133
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:28,814
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

134
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:34,267
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

135
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,627
kalanka.

136
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:40,047
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

137
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:44,158
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

138
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:46,933
be one with the puja.

139
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:54,262
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

140
00:15:54,463 --> 00:16:00,776
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

141
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:04,926
It was to be in Australia.

142
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:08,920
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

143
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,761
celebrated here.

144
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,745
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

145
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:25,263
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

146
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:27,120
over nine days we have done.

147
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,313
But never this Navaratri as such

148
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:33,463
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

149
00:16:33,664 --> 00:16:37,473
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

150
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:41,459
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

151
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,017
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

152
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:53,663
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

153
00:16:53,864 --> 00:17:00,826
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

154
00:17:08,054 --> 00:17:12,604
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

155
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:19,953
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

156
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:23,804
our heights,

157
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,781
in our realization.

158
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:28,948
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

159
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,218
we are rising high;

160
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,803
so He preserves and He protects.

161
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:41,817
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

162
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:47,764
to have our ascent in such a way

163
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:52,273
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

164
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,289
we have full dignity;

165
00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:01,186
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

166
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:04,734
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

167
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:08,160
and do it with our heart genuinely.

168
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:12,103
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

169
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,624
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

170
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:19,132
that is, the Kundalini.

171
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,668
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

172
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:26,807
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

173
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:32,761
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

174
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:36,496
because this is the color of Australia.

175
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:40,792
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

176
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:44,786
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

177
00:18:44,987 --> 00:18:48,500
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

178
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:54,052
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

179
00:18:54,253 --> 00:18:57,633
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

180
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,820
So this one also is just the other way round,

181
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:03,880
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

182
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:07,975
This is a very traditional combination

183
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:13,426
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

184
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:21,669
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

185
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,107
can become absolutely black,

186
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:28,220
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

187
00:19:28,421 --> 00:19:37,870
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

188
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:41,435
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

189
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:46,659
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

190
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:52,620
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

191
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,963
and that’s why the color is green

192
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:58,203
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

193
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,658
at least She’s covered with.

194
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:05,729
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

195
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,603
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

196
00:20:08,804 --> 00:20:11,889
element is the Mother Earth.

197
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:19,015
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

198
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:23,784
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

199
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:26,728
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

200
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:32,014
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

201
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:34,223
It is said this ….

202
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:37,852
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

203
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:40,532
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

204
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:41,592
What’s she say?

205
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:42,686
[They cannot hear.]

206
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:44,112
 You can’t hear Me?e …]

207
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:45,313
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

208
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:49,262
 All right, so I’ll have to shout.

209
00:20:50,077 --> 00:20:51,139
Not at all?

210
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,690
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

211
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:55,608
All right. Should I use this?

212
00:20:57,274 --> 00:21:00,180
 All right. This you can hear.

213
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:08,409
So I’m now going to tell you

214
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,555
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

215
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:16,122
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

216
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:20,467
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

217
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:22,915
they don’t know what they are talking.

218
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,708
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

219
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:29,338
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

220
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:34,749
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

221
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:40,275
So He’s the first one created.

222
00:21:40,928 --> 00:21:43,656
Now it’s very symbolic:

223
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:46,929
the pure power

224
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:54,630
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

225
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:59,436
The primordial Gauri is that power

226
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:03,611
which has separated from Her Lord,

227
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:06,636
we can say.

228
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:11,109
In Her previous lives She was separated,

229
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,972
and again She’s born as Parvati.

230
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:20,641
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

231
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,974
So now the marriage has taken place,

232
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:28,908
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

233
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:32,554
The wedding kindling has to start.

234
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:34,934
But She’s not yet married,

235
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:37,020
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

236
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:45,465
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

237
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:49,892
Before that She wants to have a bath,

238
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:53,033
because She has to meet Her Lord.

239
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:56,782
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

240
00:22:56,983 --> 00:23:02,147
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

241
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:06,103
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

242
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:09,225
when She’s having Her bath.

243
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:12,394
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

244
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:17,304
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

245
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:19,782
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

246
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,600
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

247
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:27,695
So She closes the door,

248
00:23:27,896 --> 00:23:32,747
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

249
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:43,996
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

250
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:47,479
for the bride specially it is the right one,

251
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,433
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

252
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:53,843
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

253
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:58,301
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

254
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:04,837
She puts that – is made of camphor

255
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,009
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

256
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:13,749
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

257
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,489
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

258
00:24:20,054 --> 00:24:22,721
She’s having Her bath nicely.

259
00:24:22,922 --> 00:24:28,019
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

260
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,571
She doesn’t hear Him.

261
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:36,654
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

262
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:39,937
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

263
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:44,727
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

264
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,688
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

265
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,752
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

266
00:24:50,953 --> 00:24:54,822
See now the Immaculate Conception,

267
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:57,341
try to understand.

268
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:05,488
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

269
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:10,491
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

270
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:15,203
So He cuts His neck in anger,

271
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:18,006
and He enters into the bathroom.

272
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:22,087
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

273
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:26,233
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

274
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:31,238
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

275
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:36,167
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

276
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,405
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

277
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:43,284
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

278
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:46,313
How dare You kill Him?”

279
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:48,702
She said, “ Now what to do?”

280
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:51,514
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

281
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:59,279
and find the head of any animal that is available,

282
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,631
and we will put that on this trunk

283
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:07,447
and He’ll be My son again.”

284
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:11,807
Now it’s all prearranged;

285
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:15,926
because this child was not to grow into

286
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:19,009
a human ego and superego business.

287
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,381
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

288
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,917
embodiment of childlike innocence,

289
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:32,166
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

290
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:35,928
So they had to get the head of an animal.

291
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:45,054
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

292
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:48,826
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

293
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:52,753
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

294
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:56,871
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

295
00:26:57,072 --> 00:27:00,955
was lying down with her back towards her child,

296
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:04,703
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

297
00:27:04,904 --> 00:27:07,047
towards their children, never.

298
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:10,884
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

299
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:14,377
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

300
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:18,098
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

301
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,867
but she would never put the child at the back.

302
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:24,763
So the head of that little animal was cut,

303
00:27:24,964 --> 00:27:28,982
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

304
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:32,979
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

305
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:42,561
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

306
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:48,513
So the body is from Mahakali,

307
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:54,214
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

308
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:06,277
Now this Ganesha within us resides

309
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,478
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

310
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:14,783
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

311
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:21,304
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

312
00:28:21,505 --> 00:28:24,115
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

313
00:28:24,316 --> 00:28:27,782
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

314
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:30,561
and that’s how they started all these perversions

315
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:33,208
and wrong things about Ganesha.

316
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:36,991
But He is embodiment of innocence,

317
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:41,599
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

318
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:47,807
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

319
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:51,919
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

320
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,894
on this Earth as Kalki.

321
00:28:55,095 --> 00:28:57,737
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

322
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,902
such a dynamic personality like Him,

323
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:03,553
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

324
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:05,473
And it is impossible,

325
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:07,702
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

326
00:29:07,903 --> 00:29:12,888
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

327
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:18,892
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

328
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:23,247
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

329
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,388
who has no power to kill anyone.

330
00:29:27,848 --> 00:29:31,087
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

331
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,854
I don’t know how they manage these things.

332
00:29:36,996 --> 00:29:39,466
They catch hold of one thing,

333
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,940
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

334
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:45,636
now how are they authorized, God knows?

335
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:49,237
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

336
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:52,616
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

337
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,861
He said it in such a good way,

338
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:58,833
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

339
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:02,373
that “Those who are,

340
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:05,364
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

341
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:08,314
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

342
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:12,198
very clearly. Why did He say so?

343
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,412
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

344
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:19,188
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

345
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:22,200
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

346
00:30:22,401 --> 00:30:25,399
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

347
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,490
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

348
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:30,475
you have a special right.

349
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:33,428
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

350
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:37,912
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

351
00:30:38,113 --> 00:30:42,300
because you have spoilt your innocence.

352
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:46,264
They have not spoilt their innocence.

353
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,407
So though you may call yourself Christians,

354
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:52,513
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

355
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:55,259
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

356
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,009
which we have ruined.

357
00:30:58,848 --> 00:31:01,967
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

358
00:31:02,168 --> 00:31:05,261
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

359
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:07,807
a conditioning;

360
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:14,264
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

361
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:17,108
You must re-establish your innocence.

362
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:22,631
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

363
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:26,247
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

364
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:30,644
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

365
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:34,533
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

366
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:37,483
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

367
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:40,391
we could not fall into anything.

368
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:43,962
India is like, large like an elephant.

369
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:46,970
 Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

370
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,058
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

371
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:51,787
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

372
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:54,799
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

373
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,953
we never accepted him.

374
00:31:57,154 --> 00:32:00,332
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

375
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:04,772
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

376
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,132
so nothing got into their heads.

377
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,167
They never spoiled their innocence,

378
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:12,727
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

379
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:15,688
to new ideas.

380
00:32:16,647 --> 00:32:19,872
And that’s how they have, despite everything

381
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,947
they are not converted Christians,

382
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,972
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

383
00:32:24,173 --> 00:32:27,328
They have maintained their innocence much more

384
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:30,020
and their sincerity of their heart,

385
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:32,710
because they are not disconnected.

386
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:35,047
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

387
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:39,196
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

388
00:32:39,397 --> 00:32:42,127
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

389
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:45,328
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

390
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:48,073
they know in their – that it is wrong.

391
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:50,071
They may try, I mean, like people steal

392
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:54,274
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

393
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:59,817
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

394
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:06,541
our position as innocent people.

395
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:10,091
But your Mother is very gracious,

396
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:13,896
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

397
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:20,940
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

398
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:24,387
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

399
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,135
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

400
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:31,086
that you can come so close to Me.

401
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:36,951
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

402
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:45,316
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

403
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:48,571
but Shri Ganesha.

404
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:55,302
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

405
00:33:55,648 --> 00:34:00,057
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

406
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:02,688
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

407
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:06,109
you have no idea at all.

408
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:12,349
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

409
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,308
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

410
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:18,961
that is being also established.

411
00:34:19,162 --> 00:34:21,652
You’ll get back your innocence.

412
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:25,749
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

413
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,315
one has to learn, that

414
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:31,799
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

415
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,953
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

416
00:34:36,662 --> 00:34:38,743
He’s so dedicated.

417
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:43,309
There’s a story once when Parvati,

418
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,189
His Mother gave –

419
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:52,483
said that “I will give You a big present,

420
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:55,530
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

421
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:59,695
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

422
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:03,997
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

423
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:07,097
Is the, all the destructive powers

424
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:10,046
were combined to create Kartikeya.

425
00:35:10,247 --> 00:35:15,744
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

426
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:18,788
I’ll give You a prize.”

427
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:24,902
So, the conveyance of

428
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:28,510
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

429
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:33,093
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

430
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:38,573
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

431
00:35:38,774 --> 00:35:41,992
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

432
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:46,138
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

433
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:49,127
She has created all the gods.

434
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:52,420
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

435
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:55,273
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

436
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,457
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

437
00:35:58,658 --> 00:36:02,815
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

438
00:36:03,016 --> 00:36:05,869
only thrice and He got the prize.

439
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,327
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

440
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,952
He fought even Shiva.

441
00:36:14,254 --> 00:36:17,097
He fought everyone.

442
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:20,567
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

443
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:24,557
that shows complete dedication.

444
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:26,882
 And for Sahaja yogis

445
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:32,529
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

446
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,003
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

447
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:44,881
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

448
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:48,449
that’s important, though I am so close.

449
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:54,370
Even Christ would not say anything;

450
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:59,719
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

451
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:02,338
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

452
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:07,214
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

453
00:37:07,415 --> 00:37:10,454
But you forget.

454
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:16,341
So it is important to understand that they were great

455
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:21,439
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

456
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,000
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

457
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,638
which Raul Bai will teach you,

458
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,651
so that you do not make any mistakes

459
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:34,646
of saying things which are not proper.

460
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:36,972
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

461
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:40,113
but consciously if you work it out

462
00:37:40,314 --> 00:37:43,509
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

463
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,523
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

464
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:50,622
anything, can you believe it?

465
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,145
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

466
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:59,338
anything against the Holy Spirit.

467
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:03,709
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

468
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,688
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

469
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:12,146
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

470
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:15,515
and how far to go, how far to understand

471
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:21,442
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

472
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,417
So today we have a great day

473
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:32,188
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

474
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:36,414
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

475
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,884
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

476
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,085
About the times and timings,

477
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,121
one should know that Mother knows best,

478
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:48,909
and everything works out with the timing properly.

479
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:54,563
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

480
00:38:55,524 --> 00:38:59,436
and all the timings work out in that way.

481
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:03,219
So everything has to work in the way,

482
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,844
actually the timings are of the moon,

483
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:08,620
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

484
00:39:08,821 --> 00:39:10,702
what time this works out, this thing, that.

485
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:13,312
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

486
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:17,959
work out according to My understanding.

487
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,848
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

488
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:26,174
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

489
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,543
 Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

490
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,539
And if your ego is there or anything,

491
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,302
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

492
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:38,646
All right?

493
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:42,717
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

494
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:44,586
as Modi will be doing,

495
00:39:44,787 --> 00:39:48,947
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

496
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:53,163
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

497
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,864
[Hindi]

498
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:06,118
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

499
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,315
Let all the children come for the puja.
