1
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:46,843
[Shri Mataji talks aside to a yogi and asks 
him

2
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:55,719
if he has got the 108 Names of the Guru

3
00:00:55,941 --> 00:01:01,899
to read them during the puja]

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,896
Alright. So today first we have Ganesh Puja 
because Ganesha is innocence

5
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:18,938
and we have to establish Him in any place 
where we want to start

6
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:25,674
a work or do anything about it, because He 
is innocence and innocence was created

7
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,543
before everything else was created.

8
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:37,701
Is the most powerful power, I should say, 
innocence.

9
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:42,410
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is 
actually

10
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:47,670
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who 
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

11
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:55,780
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

12
00:01:55,996 --> 00:02:02,685
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

13
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:06,210
That principle is within us and that is 
very important

14
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:13,706
that we should develop the principle 
of Guru Nanak or Janak

15
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:19,896
or anyone of these primordial masters. 
Because if the Spirit is the master,

16
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:28,641
we have to become the master of ourselves. 
And the power of the masters are

17
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:41,110
that they are essences of the innocence – 
of the creator,

18
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,492
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

19
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:55,219
They are the innocence of all these. Out 
of them – this great personality –

20
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:02,392
innocence of these three personalities 
was created this great incarnation.

21
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:08,010
And their innocence is shown by their 
detachment to things – they live everywhere

22
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:13,006
just like other human beings – married, 
living in the families,

23
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:19,987
but absolutely detached. Unless and until 
this principle is awakened in you,

24
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,387
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

25
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:31,771
First of all, this principle of Guru must 
be awakened in you which gives you balance

26
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:38,403
and then the ascent has to be brought in 
through the Spirit, the Atma.

27
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:42,391
That is done by the Shakti, by 
the Kundalini Herself.

28
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:47,513
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s 
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

29
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:54,088
She nourishes that power within us, 
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

30
00:03:54,289 --> 00:04:02,616
By which She cures our mental, emotional, 
physical, spiritual being.

31
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,707
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type 
of people,

32
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:09,033
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

33
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:12,797
And after that, after She has achieved 
that,

34
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:22,389
then She ascends through your fontanel bone 
and gives you the Self Realization.

35
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,925
So it is She who is the giver of your 
moksha.

36
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:33,157
She is the one who is the giver of 
the peace, of the joy,

37
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:38,730
and this Mother of yours resides in you 
and She gives you the Realization.

38
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:43,460
So we worship Her as the power within you, 
so that you are empowered,

39
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:52,066
you become powerful. But this power makes 
you the master.

40
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:56,467
When She comes in the Void area, She makes 
you the Master

41
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:04,241
because She enlightens that Guru principle 
within you and you become the Master,

42
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:09,736
you become the master of yourself and by 
that you become the Master of others also.

43
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:14,553
The one who is not the Master of oneself 
cannot be the Master of others.

44
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:19,567
So it works out, first of all, on you and 
then it radiates.

45
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:25,073
And that radiation makes others also accept 
you as the guru.

46
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:35,005
The dynamism and that compassionate 
attitude

47
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:41,447
all develops through this Guru principle.

48
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:47,089
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini, 
the Womb, the Mother,

49
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,370
the one who we call as Aquarius.

50
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:57,049
This is residing within us and we have to 
just accept

51
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,259
Her manifestation and welcome Her with 
open heart.

52
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:10,026
And know that today is the day when we are 
expecting human beings

53
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:16,026
to rise to that level where they become 
compassion, love, affection.

54
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:22,926
This is the new awareness with which we are 
going to be

55
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,711
completely fulfilled and unless and until 
that happens

56
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:32,717
there’s no chance for the emancipation, 
no doubt about it.

57
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:39,838
We have worked out so many things in so 
many places

58
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,704
and every place, I find, has a different 
problem.

59
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:50,450
The most difficult, I find, is America, 
it’s like Mathura

60
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,743
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish 
Himself,

61
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:59,670
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and 
where Kamsa was ruling.

62
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:05,414
So the people in Mathura were the most 
difficult people because they were governed

63
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:10,746
by devils and the devils have a capacity 
to dominate good people.

64
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:14,682
They’re all so dominated that even where 
Shri Krishna lived,

65
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:22,983
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him 
and all that.

66
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:28,489
And all the dynamism of these people from 
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

67
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:34,217
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

68
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:37,778
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New 
York for the puja,

69
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,163
the first day it was written “Parivartani 
Ekadashi”.

70
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:51,028
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which 
the people are going to be destroyed.

71
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,180
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one 
by which you are going to be transformed.

72
00:07:56,381 --> 00:08:00,760
So, how is it the power that is going 
to destroy is going to transform you.

73
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:07,362
Firstly, it will destroy all that is 
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

74
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:11,898
all that makes you slave, that is going 
to be destroyed.

75
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,293
Secondly, people will be frightened, 
the halfbaked ones

76
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:21,575
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll 
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

77
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:26,183
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and 
kin are going to be destroyed,

78
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:30,757
then you’ll have much more compassion, 
much more tolerance for them

79
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:35,268
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is 
what it is,

80
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,709
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete 
mountain on His fingertip,

81
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,838
you see like this, to the right side, 
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

82
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,424
That is what is my job here, is to raise 
the mountain again

83
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:56,713
and raise it on my finger tip like that. 
But this finger has to be strong

84
00:08:56,914 --> 00:09:04,522
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja 
Yogis of America and they have to help

85
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:12,621
by their dynamic behaviour and by their 
proper understanding, responsibility

86
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:19,529
as the people belonging to this great 
nation of Fatherhood.

87
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,269
This is the finger of the Father and that 
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

88
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:33,927
has to be overpowering and has to be very 
responsible.

89
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:37,633
And in that responsibility you learn so 
many things –

90
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:41,286
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is. 
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

91
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:44,727
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell 
her that I have to raise

92
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:48,079
the mountain on my finger, you see, she 
would never have understood that.

93
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,949
But that is what one has to do here.

94
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,917
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like 
that – Mountainous.

95
00:09:57,118 --> 00:10:02,983
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston 
which is the most difficult part of it,

96
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:09,576
they just don’t move, they just don’t move, 
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

97
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:15,010
it’s so full of ignorance and so full 
of heaviness.

98
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:19,278
That is the most difficult part and that’s 
why – for Houston specially –

99
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:24,832
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini 
that She rises in Houston.

100
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,722
May God bless you all.

101
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,949
Can you give me the handkerchief.

102
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,930
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant 
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

103
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:59,839
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi. 
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

104
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,926
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering 
Anant Chaturdashi.

105
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:09,780
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

106
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:18,145
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha 
in the water.

107
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,014
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha 
in to the water)

108
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:28,011
Because He’s established for ten days and 
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

109
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:33,964
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water 
so that everywhere His Power is spread

110
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:38,345
through the water. That’s why no wonder 
there was a puja.

111
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:42,094
Ganesha settled down into the water.

112
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:46,413
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the, 
is Shri Ganesha.

113
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:51,264
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed. 
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

114
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:56,186
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi 
means the day

115
00:11:56,387 --> 00:12:01,495
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

116
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:10,550
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped 
for ten days and again given back.

117
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:18,509
So it’s a very great day today, I should 
say, like the resurrection of Christ

118
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:24,872
that you are,

119
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:31,283
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

120
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:36,052
and then went back to His Father. Father is 
the ocean

121
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:41,429
and that’s what in India they do, establish 
Him on the fourth day

122
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,064
and on the tenth day they put Him back 
to the ocean.

123
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,793
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in 
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

124
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:51,102
Yogi: I said we used to do the same 
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

125
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,339
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our 
school.

126
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,495
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in 
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

127
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:02,877
Shri Mataji: Really? What school? 
Yogi: (School name).

128
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:08,715
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four 
of the guys used to carry them on.

129
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,645
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They 
just do it without understanding

130
00:13:11,846 --> 00:13:15,679
what they are doing about it. So it’s 
a thing, even in India

131
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,205
how many people know about Ganesha, 
no one knows.

132
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:21,471
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In 
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

133
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:25,345
but they don’t know much about it. They 
don’t know how much He’s important,

134
00:13:25,546 --> 00:13:29,461
about what He represents, how did He came 
on this earth, nothing they know.

135
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:33,996
We have become very superficial that way.

136
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:41,900
But at least it keeps your attention by 
doing all these things, “there”.

137
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:46,290
You see, this is the advantage of in India, 
the children have to be little bit

138
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:51,822
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals 
and all that they try to then find out

139
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:55,674
what is this, what is that. Their attention 
is more there, not outside so much,

140
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,191
you see, that’s the thing is.
