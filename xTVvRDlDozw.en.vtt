WEBVTT

08:26.840 --> 08:29.756
Who’s going to translate Me?

08:47.340 --> 08:51.090
Why don’t you take one of these, Gregoire?

09:02.923 --> 09:05.382
Mother, that is the public address microphone

09:05.631 --> 09:06.810
– they won’t be able to hear You.

09:07.048 --> 09:08.730
This is for the recording on the tape.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.507
Then how will they hear this? …

09:14.382 --> 09:17.673
Yes. Then – how will you translate?

09:17.909 --> 09:19.507
In French

09:19.734 --> 09:21.631
But loudly.

09:23.424 --> 09:25.458
I think, why don’t you stand up and see there

09:25.658 --> 09:27.459
– you can stand up there.

09:27.659 --> 09:31.909
Yes, there. And you can talk loudly, that’s a better way.

09:32.371 --> 09:35.413
Be careful about those ….

10:00.048 --> 10:04.673
May God bless you. Hello – yes, yes!

10:05.045 --> 10:09.670
Thank you, thank you. Aradhana has come.

10:10.006 --> 10:15.630
Go and see them. There, there!

10:29.756 --> 10:38.673
In the most auspicious time that is called as Krita Yuga,

10:41.135 --> 10:44.819
we all have assembled here

10:46.333 --> 10:53.249
to understand the ways and methods

10:54.424 --> 11:02.173
of establishing our Principle of a Master.

11:06.854 --> 11:10.188
Krita Yuga.

11:31.919 --> 11:36.669
“Krita Yuga” means the time

11:38.314 --> 11:41.105
when you have to do something –

11:41.480 --> 11:43.771
“krita: when it was done.”

11:56.596 --> 12:00.554
So you are the channels of that doing,

12:07.464 --> 12:10.464
doing the work of God.

12:13.763 --> 12:18.490
You are the channels of God Almighty and His Power.

12:27.400 --> 12:35.441
On one side you have to carry the dignity,

12:35.870 --> 12:40.911
the glory, and the assumption that you are a guru.

12:54.507 --> 12:58.465
On the other side you have to be completely surrendered

12:58.745 --> 13:01.829
to your God Almighty.

13:10.835 --> 13:14.969
All your dignity, your authority comes from Him.

13:21.336 --> 13:24.062
And the third thing is

13:24.440 --> 13:29.649
that the way He has created this universe and you,

13:30.403 --> 13:31.466
in a mood of play,

13:36.333 --> 13:38.881
you have to see His play.

13:49.934 --> 13:55.560
So a kind of mood that is cheerfulness

13:55.866 --> 14:00.191
should be really bubbling through you.

14:09.820 --> 14:13.029
So far the idea of guru was

14:13.299 --> 14:16.098
that such a person never laughs, never smiles,

14:16.457 --> 14:18.956
always in a temper.

14:24.424 --> 14:26.340
That was all right for gurus

14:26.673 --> 14:30.054
who did not have to have any contact with the public,

14:30.325 --> 14:32.116
but hanged themselves with a string

14:32.616 --> 14:34.782
somewhere in the Himalayas.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.798
But here we are, facing

14:48.336 --> 14:53.503
the entire universe that has to receive

14:53.843 --> 14:56.801
the bubbling streams of your love.

15:07.684 --> 15:10.432
But that does not mean that you have to be frivolous,

15:10.673 --> 15:12.608
because you cannot be.

15:18.923 --> 15:21.715
The divine play is not frivolous,

15:24.424 --> 15:27.178
it is joyful,

15:27.631 --> 15:30.589
and the joy does not have that duality.

15:37.469 --> 15:43.298
So to get to the establishment of your Guru Principle,

15:43.498 --> 15:47.340
first we should know how it is destroyed.

16:00.507 --> 16:03.946
As it is, anything that is not looked after

16:04.173 --> 16:07.340
or maintained gets destroyed.

16:17.991 --> 16:20.046
If we do not pay attention,

16:20.257 --> 16:25.549
say, to these beautiful plants here, they will be destroyed.

16:33.888 --> 16:38.264
Even matter which is not attended to gets destroyed.

16:43.127 --> 16:48.710
So first of all, we have to know that we must be attentive

16:53.798 --> 16:57.590
and alert that if we do not maintain ourselves,

16:57.848 --> 16:59.376
we’ll be destroyed.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.863
Because maintenance is not for maintenance sake,

17:14.601 --> 17:22.101
it is for stopping the destruction of your Guru Principle.

17:30.013 --> 17:33.347
When we are negligent or lazy about it,

17:33.597 --> 17:37.597
we are responsible for destroying our Guru Principle.

17:46.090 --> 17:49.424
So the attention that we have

17:49.684 --> 17:54.851
is to be given to the maintenance of this Guru Principle.

18:04.673 --> 18:12.215
The gurus have the capacity to maintain themselves

18:12.549 --> 18:15.590
and maintain others.

18:24.169 --> 18:29.710
In the beginning, when the gurus tried to establish

18:29.968 --> 18:34.968
this maintenance principle,

18:35.627 --> 18:40.294
they put very, very strong rules and regulations.

18:54.303 --> 19:01.555
If you read Bible in the Levi chapter,

19:01.779 --> 19:05.291
you will find all the shariats that are described,

19:05.529 --> 19:08.515
which they are following now in Riyadh

19:08.715 --> 19:11.798
or in the Arabic countries.

19:26.589 --> 19:32.798
To maintain that principle within yourself,

19:33.552 --> 19:35.677
it’s written in such strong languages,

19:35.965 --> 19:38.409
like “Such a person who does not do this

19:38.628 --> 19:41.045
should be killed to death.

19:50.002 --> 19:53.868
Such a person does anything wrong of this kind

19:54.132 --> 19:56.840
should be killed by stoning.”

20:03.590 --> 20:06.923
That was at the very beginning, so the people now

20:07.226 --> 20:12.601
at that stage of evolution required that kind of a fear.

20:19.048 --> 20:23.715
This was not meant to in any way to insult or to harm,

20:23.953 --> 20:27.453
or to take away the freedom of human beings.

20:34.911 --> 20:39.777
But it was meant for people

20:40.048 --> 20:44.272
to give a great idea of the importance

20:44.549 --> 20:47.507
of the Principle of Guru within themselves.

20:55.653 --> 21:00.862
At that stage they used the frightening methods,

21:01.063 --> 21:06.810
I should say – horribly dangerous times.

21:12.752 --> 21:15.835
And that time people obeyed also.

21:21.355 --> 21:26.170
Then another evolutionary state took place

21:26.370 --> 21:31.435
where a stage started,

21:32.140 --> 21:36.014
people thought they must become austere,

21:36.387 --> 21:40.715
and start maintaining themselves by tremendous austerity.

21:40.938 --> 21:42.792
So it was self-projected;

21:42.992 --> 21:44.963
it was not projected towards others,

21:45.163 --> 21:47.419
but projected towards themselves.

21:58.866 --> 22:02.788
We can say that the first wave started when the Guru,

22:03.014 --> 22:08.286
the Primordial Guru said that if you don’t do this,

22:08.510 --> 22:11.224
then you will be killed.

22:11.424 --> 22:15.962
The second stage was where the disciples accepted this

22:16.254 --> 22:19.651
within themselves, and started telling themselves

22:19.851 --> 22:23.226
that if we do not do it we’ll kill ourselves.

22:41.257 --> 22:45.945
Austerity started on the basis of wisdom,

22:46.184 --> 22:48.184
and not on obstinacy.

22:54.881 --> 22:58.706
But then it became even fanaticism,

23:03.549 --> 23:05.928
so it went to one extreme.

23:10.309 --> 23:14.845
It started with the idea of maintenance.

23:15.078 --> 23:17.657
It started with the idea of maintenance.

23:23.563 --> 23:28.696
But maintenance itself became impossible,

23:28.896 --> 23:31.242
or perhaps they thought that they are not being

23:31.442 --> 23:33.870
able to maintain, they got confused,

23:34.070 --> 23:37.033
and to them rules and regulations became more important

23:37.233 --> 23:39.224
than maintenance itself.

23:51.268 --> 23:54.683
Thus you find they destroyed themselves.

23:58.684 --> 24:04.268
The wisdom or the essence of Guru Tattwa is a balance.

24:11.585 --> 24:14.179
Like when you maintain a plant,

24:14.379 --> 24:17.240
if you do not give it water, it will die.

24:17.502 --> 24:19.934
If you give it too much water, it will die.

24:24.673 --> 24:28.507
So the wisdom lies in understanding

24:29.344 --> 24:33.663
how much water should be given to the plant,

24:33.863 --> 24:36.983
so that it comes up at its best.

24:45.090 --> 24:48.169
Now this wisdom has to be achieved

24:48.369 --> 24:51.411
through your vibratory awareness.

24:56.382 --> 25:03.105
You are placed under the most fortunate circumstances,

25:03.305 --> 25:05.762
that you are realized souls

25:05.962 --> 25:10.295
before your Guru Tattwa is fully established.

25:22.112 --> 25:26.615
You have all the powers that any guru can aspire,

25:26.851 --> 25:31.036
without having the establishment of Guru Tattwa.

25:38.772 --> 25:42.913
Specially you are under the complete

25:43.119 --> 25:48.202
blanket of the clouds of your Mother’s love.

25:57.168 --> 26:02.049
But in no way Mother’s love is going to allow you

26:02.249 --> 26:04.659
to destroy your Guru Principle.

26:11.191 --> 26:17.191
As I told you that Guru Principle is a very sensitive thing,

26:17.475 --> 26:22.686
and is destroyed if you yourself do not try to maintain it.

26:33.733 --> 26:37.685
First of all, the destruction starts

26:37.885 --> 26:39.081
from the very source

26:44.325 --> 26:47.060
of our being.

27:03.162 --> 27:09.538
I mean to say that our being is created by five elements,

27:13.549 --> 27:16.590
and the five elements have a capacity

27:16.791 --> 27:18.861
all the time to get destroyed.

27:23.396 --> 27:27.146
Any one of these elements if they are not looked after,

27:27.715 --> 27:29.359
they get destroyed.

27:34.226 --> 27:37.039
That is the built-in capacity of the elements

27:37.294 --> 27:40.002
or of the matter, as you can say.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.412
So to maintain them is important.

27:50.642 --> 27:54.435
Some people have an idea that once you become a guru

27:54.665 --> 27:57.707
you need not maintain everything, it is maintained by itself.

28:07.756 --> 28:09.890
It is not.

28:10.090 --> 28:19.507
Agreed that the spirit definitely enhances the beauty

28:19.968 --> 28:22.849
and the health of these elements;

28:30.786 --> 28:35.917
but at the human level there is always a greater force

28:36.117 --> 28:37.988
that is trying to destroy it.

28:45.302 --> 28:48.984
So till we have completely become the spirit,

28:49.184 --> 28:54.133
there is always a chance of this destruction working it out.

29:05.675 --> 29:08.551
One may say, why this balance needed?

29:08.779 --> 29:12.937
And this is an important question which we

29:13.175 --> 29:17.671
should be able to answer all the people who ask us.

29:23.715 --> 29:27.965
Without the balance you cannot ascend.

29:32.590 --> 29:34.938
If you cannot ascend,

29:35.177 --> 29:39.139
what’s the use of our becoming human beings?

29:44.340 --> 29:48.065
For example, everything is God,

29:50.102 --> 29:53.377
but nobody is aware.

29:53.704 --> 29:56.828
At the human level you become aware:

29:58.881 --> 30:03.631
means everything exists, everything is there,

30:03.855 --> 30:06.514
but it is not aware.

30:13.813 --> 30:17.932
Say, there is a stone, that is also God,

30:18.166 --> 30:21.540
but it is not yet aware.

30:26.132 --> 30:31.129
Like say, this area is completely dark and we are blind.

30:36.465 --> 30:38.844
There is nothing to be seen,

30:39.105 --> 30:42.915
to be felt or experienced when you are in that condition.

30:47.798 --> 30:53.048
Actually one thinks that darkness is the truth,

30:56.298 --> 30:58.538
that ignorance is the truth.

31:00.340 --> 31:05.132
But when the sun comes up and the light comes in

31:05.465 --> 31:08.631
and your eyes open, you start seeing everything.

31:14.858 --> 31:17.370
You start becoming aware.

31:19.288 --> 31:24.579
So at human level you are aware at the highest point.

31:29.475 --> 31:31.888
Now this awareness has to become

31:32.139 --> 31:35.081
the awareness of the spirit.

31:42.086 --> 31:44.735
That has happened to you

31:46.881 --> 31:48.627
– you have felt the spirit.

31:50.242 --> 31:53.077
But the balance is not there as yet.

31:55.507 --> 32:01.098
Your Mother has pulled you out and made you that,

32:01.298 --> 32:04.163
but still there is imbalance inside.

32:14.798 --> 32:17.901
If you go slightly to the left you can be destroyed;

32:18.101 --> 32:20.934
you go to the right, you’ll be destroyed.

32:25.465 --> 32:28.449
So you have to try both the things

32:28.673 --> 32:33.446
as I have told you the methods, which I’ll explain.

32:37.170 --> 32:41.133
First of all you have to be austere with yourself.

32:44.082 --> 32:47.416
Just separate yourself from yourself.

32:50.464 --> 32:53.251
Separate yourself as a spirit,

32:53.451 --> 32:56.404
and look at your ego and superego.

33:03.498 --> 33:05.522
Now you start watching,

33:05.722 --> 33:10.225
you start watching the ego and superego.

33:12.549 --> 33:13.978
Do not maintain it

33:15.090 --> 33:17.798
– they are the destroying forces.

33:23.559 --> 33:29.964
Now when you see the play as a witness

33:30.369 --> 33:32.363
of these destroying forces,

33:32.563 --> 33:37.772
you will know how to also maintain yourself better.

33:45.801 --> 33:52.369
To separate yourself is easier when you take to austerity.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.879
The worst thing that elements have done to you

34:07.079 --> 34:09.715
is that you have formed habits,

34:14.124 --> 34:16.819
all kinds of hangs-up.

34:20.238 --> 34:22.238
Some people are fond of bathing,

34:22.468 --> 34:26.087
some people are fond of not bathing.

34:32.715 --> 34:35.900
Some people are fond of getting early in the morning,

34:36.257 --> 34:38.715
four o’clock, and singing songs and waking up everyone,

34:38.933 --> 34:43.465
and some are good at sleeping till ten o’clock.

34:53.401 --> 34:56.666
Some like very light-colored dresses,

34:56.866 --> 34:59.381
some like very loud-colored dresses.

35:04.789 --> 35:07.220
If you are English, then you want to have

35:07.420 --> 35:11.943
English-style everything, horrible insipid food!

35:23.166 --> 35:26.428
If you are French, you want to have wine, little bit.

35:31.378 --> 35:36.093
If you are Italian you want to have carbohydrates, too much.

35:42.063 --> 35:45.461
If you are Spanish, you
want to have too much fats.

35:47.996 --> 35:51.922
If you are Indians, you want to have too much of spices.

35:55.336 --> 35:58.867
So to change this habit,

35:59.067 --> 36:03.084
you have to give first of all the extremes that you like.

36:09.756 --> 36:19.326
Now if you say that “I like bland food” – bland food

36:22.715 --> 36:26.590
– then you should say “I must eat a lot of chillies.”

36:30.669 --> 36:33.088
If you say “I like pale colors,”

36:33.288 --> 36:35.947
then you wear very loud ones.

36:41.707 --> 36:45.131
Go from one extreme to another extreme, to begin with.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.772
But I’ve seen people, when they go from one extreme

36:52.988 --> 36:55.289
they get stuck up on the other side also.

37:02.104 --> 37:06.055
So we have to be in the center, not to the extremes.

37:10.132 --> 37:15.715
A man who is an avadhuta, the one who is a great master,

37:16.140 --> 37:22.025
can never be hanged up by any hangs-up.

37:29.772 --> 37:34.848
He cannot be ruled by any ideas that “I like this.”

37:41.010 --> 37:43.711
He sees beauty in the lush greenery,

37:43.911 --> 37:46.548
and he sees beauty in the trees

37:46.820 --> 37:50.488
which are devoid of any leaves.

37:58.919 --> 38:03.221
Now the trend of getting to austerity

38:03.436 --> 38:06.957
in a very funny way has started in the West.

38:12.585 --> 38:17.393
Like if you comb your hair, then you are no good;

38:21.695 --> 38:26.526
if you do not smell in the body, then you are no good;

38:30.684 --> 38:33.873
if you don’t look like a pig, you are no good.

38:38.400 --> 38:42.816
All kinds of funny sort of ideas have crawled into the mind,

38:43.026 --> 38:47.003
because they are going to the other extreme.

38:52.170 --> 38:54.779
But we have to learn from the nature.

38:54.979 --> 38:58.708
Nature dresses up itself when it has to greet the spring,

38:58.908 --> 39:00.889
and when it is the winter

39:01.089 --> 39:05.671
it just gets completely undressed, I should say,

39:06.022 --> 39:08.996
because the leaves have to go to the Mother Earth,

39:09.196 --> 39:13.695
and that the sun has to reach the Mother Earth.

39:21.764 --> 39:25.847
It is not attached to anything.

39:29.424 --> 39:33.965
Surprisingly it is much more elemental than we are;

39:37.385 --> 39:42.870
while we who are spiritual should have no attachment.

39:47.881 --> 39:50.798
But this idea is also a mental idea,

39:51.013 --> 39:53.801
which is the worst attachment.

40:01.246 --> 40:05.422
It’s a very funny attachment which makes Me laugh,

40:05.681 --> 40:07.890
that’s the biggest joker I’ve seen,

40:08.090 --> 40:11.023
that people get attached to mental ideas.

40:23.484 --> 40:27.521
It is like believing that whatever you think mentally

40:27.721 --> 40:29.616
will just happen to you.

40:36.043 --> 40:38.791
Say, for a mental person he has to go to picnic,

40:38.991 --> 40:42.547
he will mentally put in his mind he’s going to take

40:42.751 --> 40:45.143
this that, that and that.

40:51.465 --> 40:54.570
He may even open a file and write it down that

40:54.770 --> 40:58.770
“I am going to take this and this and this with me.”

41:03.374 --> 41:06.496
And when he goes to the picnic he finds he’s high and dry,

41:06.696 --> 41:08.416
because he has not taken anything with him,

41:08.616 --> 41:11.417
it’s all in the file!

41:20.624 --> 41:24.416
Your Mother is good at speaking and She speaks to you,

41:24.616 --> 41:28.912
but it should not be your mental attachment.

41:40.783 --> 41:42.560
Like “Yes, Mother says so,”

41:42.760 --> 41:46.544
and everybody discusses with such great enthusiasm,

41:46.744 --> 41:48.536
this is that; but it’s not become

41:48.760 --> 41:50.675
part and parcel of your being.

42:01.098 --> 42:04.515
But is a very common attachment nowadays,

42:04.715 --> 42:07.298
with all the people knowing about everything

42:07.498 --> 42:09.501
and having nothing.

42:16.132 --> 42:20.715
This mental attachment is to be really attacked.

42:30.396 --> 42:35.939
Becoming is seeing, becoming is experiencing;

42:37.245 --> 42:41.661
becoming is seeing, it is experiencing.

42:46.434 --> 42:48.359
Like if I have to come to this place,

42:48.559 --> 42:51.767
I must come and see it.

42:55.169 --> 42:58.544
If only I have thoughts about it and mental idea,

42:58.761 --> 43:02.719
mental picture, it is no good, I can – it’s not mine,

43:03.218 --> 43:04.885
it’s not the truth.

43:11.271 --> 43:15.162
So when you become aware, actually what happens that it,

43:15.362 --> 43:19.612
you see it yourselves – so let us see.

43:28.324 --> 43:31.241
Get out of that mental conception

43:31.524 --> 43:34.505
that you know already about it.

43:43.673 --> 43:46.265
You do not know,

43:46.465 --> 43:49.042
because what you know is just mental.

43:50.957 --> 43:54.592
That should be a part and parcel of your being.

44:00.225 --> 44:03.225
Now how to do it?

44:04.881 --> 44:06.923
Some will say that

44:07.124 --> 44:11.151
“We’ll just go on being austere about it.”

44:14.382 --> 44:18.079
Then that will become again another obsession.

44:20.469 --> 44:21.593
Some will say, “All right,

44:21.795 --> 44:26.003
Mother has said we should enjoy, so we’ll just enjoy.”

44:35.200 --> 44:37.258
How to strike the balance

44:38.608 --> 44:40.537
is the big problem,

44:42.291 --> 44:43.707
but should not be with people

44:43.939 --> 44:46.374
who have vibratory awareness.

44:50.507 --> 44:54.957
In that also you can be obsessed.

44:57.507 --> 45:00.291
I have seen people talking as if they are all

45:00.491 --> 45:02.723
great Sahaja yogis and there were no vibrations,

45:02.923 --> 45:05.025
and saying they are getting vibrations.

45:14.356 --> 45:17.605
It is so deceptive.

45:20.314 --> 45:23.522
So one has to think that we have to grow further

45:23.771 --> 45:28.067
and see more and more, and know about it.

45:34.840 --> 45:38.999
But if you then ask the French “How are you?”

45:39.199 --> 45:43.615
then under the influence of this, they’ll say like this:

45:43.829 --> 45:46.967
that means they’re always in imbalance.

45:56.915 --> 45:59.949
You ask an Englishman, he’ll say, “Don’t know.”

46:04.794 --> 46:08.741
Or they say “I know” – there’s nothing in between.

46:11.381 --> 46:13.481
Now we have to understand that

46:13.681 --> 46:17.056
we are carrying the light in our hand,

46:20.268 --> 46:22.814
and the light should not shake.

46:24.673 --> 46:26.895
We have to hold the light tight,

46:28.756 --> 46:31.652
and we should have a concentrated attention

46:31.923 --> 46:33.879
towards the maintenance of the light.

46:40.290 --> 46:44.238
And then to tell yourself that we have to see,

46:44.438 --> 46:47.598
not to just understand mentally.

46:54.174 --> 46:56.618
It’s to be actually aware;

46:58.650 --> 47:00.865
because you are complete otherwise,

47:04.242 --> 47:06.651
you are the part and parcel of the whole

47:08.305 --> 47:10.426
– you are.

47:11.559 --> 47:15.988
But only thing, that you have not yet seen that.

47:19.590 --> 47:21.636
You have mentally accepted,

47:21.836 --> 47:24.127
but you have not become that.

47:27.715 --> 47:30.493
Because mental projection comes from thought;

47:33.021 --> 47:35.612
that means you are at the level of the thought.

47:37.589 --> 47:40.312
You have to become thoughtless.

47:43.007 --> 47:45.693
But if you live on the basis of thought

47:45.893 --> 47:49.312
then you are still below the Agnya Chakra.

47:53.215 --> 47:56.139
So all the thought waves must be stopped to begin with,

47:56.339 --> 47:59.391
and should say that “All right, let us see now.”

48:07.492 --> 48:10.378
So from the Nabhi Chakra you come up

48:10.578 --> 48:12.723
to the Agnya Chakra.

48:16.862 --> 48:21.544
Then above that comes the third problem of destruction,

48:21.801 --> 48:24.254
is emotional.

48:37.673 --> 48:43.048
The emotional is a very subtle one.

48:46.954 --> 48:49.121
Like some people, Sahaja yogis,

48:49.344 --> 48:51.345
will sit down with a guitar

48:51.566 --> 48:57.757
and will start singing as if they are all lovebirds, you see!

49:10.953 --> 49:14.293
What is it? What is it?

49:14.531 --> 49:18.807
Come along. Come, come...

49:19.007 --> 49:21.882
What has happened?

49:22.957 --> 49:24.836
Why, why do you cry?

49:25.071 --> 49:28.154
Come to Me, come to Me. All right.

49:28.843 --> 49:35.802
Just take her away. She’s caught up.

49:37.476 --> 49:43.477
So the most delicate one is the emotional.

49:48.154 --> 49:55.112
This emotional one is a collectivity in a camouflage.

50:01.075 --> 50:03.413
For example, when the Sahaja yogis will meet,

50:03.613 --> 50:06.718
they’ll hug themselves, kiss each other,

50:06.918 --> 50:11.126
and will be very, very nice to each other, you see,

50:11.382 --> 50:14.700
and sit down and sing songs like hippies.

50:27.560 --> 50:34.190
Take the guitar in the hand and swing on the tune of love.

50:40.128 --> 50:44.258
This is actually Vishuddhi at the collectivity point,

50:47.382 --> 50:51.707
and that of course is very difficult to get rid of,

50:55.351 --> 50:59.797
because it gives you a very comfortable feeling.

51:03.329 --> 51:10.393
And people get confused with emotions,

51:10.767 --> 51:12.933
they think it is joy.

51:18.405 --> 51:23.488
Joy only can be achieved through complete detachment,

51:28.715 --> 51:34.050
the detachment which is ego-less and superego-less.

51:37.979 --> 51:43.687
But now, the problem that human beings start facing

51:44.299 --> 51:50.837
is the assumption that they are gurus.

52:02.075 --> 52:04.920
They start speaking about Sahaja Yoga,

52:05.120 --> 52:06.765
talking about Sahaja Yoga,

52:06.965 --> 52:09.760
and they start thinking that

52:10.010 --> 52:13.247
they have become already Shri Krishna.

52:22.007 --> 52:28.132
They have even a greater ego than

52:28.654 --> 52:32.446
the person who is

52:35.585 --> 52:40.211
actually ignorant about Sahaja Yoga.

52:50.737 --> 52:53.487
They start talking with such tremendous ego

52:53.704 --> 52:56.375
that I am Myself frightened of them:

52:56.654 --> 52:58.580
how much they know about Sahaja Yoga,

52:58.798 --> 53:01.756
I sometimes think?

53:13.703 --> 53:18.455
And they start asserting it so much that it’s frightening.

53:24.737 --> 53:28.460
All this can be also said, that

53:28.767 --> 53:31.264
they feel that protocol is not all right

53:31.464 --> 53:33.042
and there should be proper protocol,

53:33.242 --> 53:34.723
so we are looking after protocol,

53:34.923 --> 53:36.617
we are the guards of the protocol,

53:36.817 --> 53:38.784
and all these things there.

53:45.699 --> 53:48.540
Now those who are on the emotional side

53:48.805 --> 53:52.193
see the ego of others, while those who are on the ego side

53:52.393 --> 53:54.928
see the emotions of others.

54:03.299 --> 54:05.881
So one criticizes another,

54:08.048 --> 54:13.408
but they don’t see themselves that they are falling a trap

54:13.608 --> 54:15.636
into one of the extremes.

54:20.257 --> 54:25.465
So unless and until you are detached, you cannot see it.

54:33.824 --> 54:35.836
I will not say I did, committed a mistake,

54:36.036 --> 54:38.700
but it happened to be a mistake.

54:42.893 --> 54:45.033
For the first three years of Sahaja Yoga

54:45.233 --> 54:47.500
never talked of a bhoot.

54:51.642 --> 54:54.716
I thought I’ll be able to manage without that.

54:58.706 --> 55:02.453
But a lady came in Sahaja Yoga who was possessed

55:02.653 --> 55:05.844
and who tried all kinds of tantric tricks,
so I had to tell them.

55:13.843 --> 55:17.927
Now every Sahaja yogi is a bundle of bhoots!

55:23.199 --> 55:24.795
You ask any Sahaja yogi,

55:25.058 --> 55:28.197
“Why did you do it?” – “Must be a bhoot.”

55:34.510 --> 55:40.276
If you say that “How is it that you have done such a thing?”

55:40.476 --> 55:42.114
then they will say that

55:42.314 --> 55:45.906
“I do not know, it’s the bhoot who has done.”

55:51.727 --> 55:55.974
They are never there – all the bhoots are there.

56:01.075 --> 56:04.408
Now I don’t understand how to deal even as a Guru,

56:04.608 --> 56:07.775
because if My disciples are there I can tell them,

56:08.053 --> 56:11.253
but if they are bhoots, what am I to tell them?

56:18.189 --> 56:20.496
I can talk to Sahaja yogis but not to bhoots,

56:20.696 --> 56:22.529
they won’t listen to Me.

56:26.645 --> 56:29.091
So this is the greatest escape

56:29.291 --> 56:31.157
that Sahaja yogis have found now,

56:31.360 --> 56:33.889
which is the worst, which was never before.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.540
So sometimes I feel it was a mistake

56:42.740 --> 56:45.499
I introduced this word “bhoot.”

56:53.113 --> 56:55.674
They excuse themselves by just saying,

56:55.874 --> 56:58.237
“Mother, it is some negativity.”

57:05.749 --> 57:09.498
Unless and until there is something in you

57:09.699 --> 57:14.195
that contains the negativity, how can there be negativity?

57:20.424 --> 57:23.178
If you are detached, if like stone,

57:23.378 --> 57:27.614
then you cannot contain this negative water in itself, in it.

57:35.002 --> 57:36.871
You don’t become more negativity,

57:37.090 --> 57:39.490
you become more a guru.

57:45.828 --> 57:49.328
Now, when I say that you should not be negative

57:49.536 --> 57:51.394
– supposing under such circumstances

57:51.631 --> 57:53.715
you should not be a bhoot, you should be yourself

57:53.931 --> 57:56.298
– then they start feeling guilty.

58:04.707 --> 58:09.195
So all kinds of anti-guru tricks are working out.

58:13.405 --> 58:16.821
I am your Guru, and it is anti your Guru

58:17.067 --> 58:19.711
to play these tricks upon yourself.

58:24.532 --> 58:28.600
Now you will play these tricks with Me, what’s the use?

58:33.726 --> 58:35.704
You have to gain something,

58:35.904 --> 58:38.191
and you are playing trick against yourself

58:38.392 --> 58:40.628
if you are playing them against Me.

58:51.275 --> 58:53.764
You have to be more aware.

58:56.002 --> 58:59.127
You are not to be destroyed.

58:59.715 --> 59:03.033
Apart from that you have to save others.

59:06.899 --> 59:10.659
How will you do it, in case if you do not accept

59:10.859 --> 59:14.603
that it is your privilege,

59:14.889 --> 59:17.279
that it is your fortune,

59:17.491 --> 59:19.616
that you have been chosen

59:19.893 --> 59:24.167
to be the medium of God’s work?

59:38.396 --> 59:40.769
Sometimes I feel all the bhoots have come to Me

59:40.969 --> 59:42.803
for realization, and I am now going to become

59:43.101 --> 59:44.596
a bhoot Myself!

59:58.211 --> 01:00:02.698
“Bhoot” also means “Bhootnath”– is the name of

01:00:03.418 --> 01:00:05.855
Shri Shankara, Shri Shiva,

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:14.058
because He gets after the bhoots all the time.

01:00:18.426 --> 01:00:20.899
But you have to be the present and not the bhoot

01:00:21.099 --> 01:00:22.573
– “bhoot” means the past.

01:00:26.424 --> 01:00:31.090
Then what is there to be known? You become.
Then you are in the present,

01:00:33.972 --> 01:00:35.721
you just start becoming,

01:00:36.721 --> 01:00:37.942
evolving,

01:00:39.446 --> 01:00:40.675
blossoming.

01:00:42.613 --> 01:00:45.387
Try to be in the present.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.372
Do not escape the present, face it.

01:00:52.596 --> 01:00:55.555
Don’t feel guilty nor blame the bhoot;

01:00:55.898 --> 01:00:58.849
both things are going to take you away from the present.

01:01:06.132 --> 01:01:11.465
Now just see the whole nature, the whole divine Power,

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:17.625
your ardent desire of ages

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:21.612
– everything is on your side.

01:01:32.509 --> 01:01:34.219
The time has come.

01:01:35.939 --> 01:01:37.667
You are just there.

01:01:40.424 --> 01:01:42.573
What have we to do?

01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:47.605
Just stand in the center,

01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:51.301
at the axis.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.927
Try to keep yourself at the axis,

01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:01.743
and then you just see the periphery moving, you don’t mind.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.973
When you see yourself misbehaving in any way,

01:02:10.231 --> 01:02:12.083
punish yourself.

01:02:14.975 --> 01:02:18.465
It is better that you punish than the Divine punishes you,

01:02:18.665 --> 01:02:20.741
because that’s a severe punishment.

01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:28.291
But do not feel guilty because

01:02:28.491 --> 01:02:29.704
you have not done anything wrong,

01:02:29.904 --> 01:02:32.113
it’s the bhoot which has done!

01:02:45.646 --> 01:02:49.146
So we come to the point that we should realize

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.973
that we are gurus and we cannot be bhoots.

01:03:04.325 --> 01:03:09.075
We have to change our outside also, to become good gurus.

01:03:19.384 --> 01:03:23.509
For example, we have to learn good manners.

01:03:27.502 --> 01:03:30.696
Then these manners become your nature.

01:03:35.556 --> 01:03:38.011
Sometimes, people who are very fond of food,

01:03:38.211 --> 01:03:41.336
I always tell them they should fast.

01:03:46.385 --> 01:03:49.284
Whatever you are fond of, try to give up.

01:03:56.543 --> 01:04:01.877
Try to overcome your sicknesses of attachments,

01:04:06.798 --> 01:04:09.424
your habits.

01:04:09.854 --> 01:04:13.188
Once your Guru Tattwa is established,

01:04:13.828 --> 01:04:17.495
you’ll be accepted as a guru.

01:04:23.688 --> 01:04:26.521
There will not be any need for you to say

01:04:26.753 --> 01:04:29.216
that you are a guru, people will know that you are.

01:04:36.135 --> 01:04:38.551
We don’t have to then write on our foreheads

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:40.588
that we are gurus, people will know that

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:45.036
this is a guru walking; you can see the divinity walking,

01:04:45.367 --> 01:04:49.783
you can see the dignity walking, the glory coming up.

01:05:02.775 --> 01:05:05.628
You have to change from within,

01:05:07.673 --> 01:05:11.923
and the light of that within enlightenment

01:05:12.207 --> 01:05:14.850
will be shown outside.

01:05:21.972 --> 01:05:26.859
But it should not be a mental idea or an emotional idea,

01:05:27.059 --> 01:05:30.077
but should be the happening,

01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:33.909
the becoming, the awareness.

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:47.424
You have to experience,

01:05:47.673 --> 01:05:52.153
through your own experimentation upon yourself.

01:05:58.842 --> 01:06:00.991
Even I do that.

01:06:02.545 --> 01:06:05.088
When I cannot reach you from one end

01:06:05.393 --> 01:06:08.726
because you are a bhoot, I reach you from the other.

01:06:14.059 --> 01:06:16.604
If somebody says he’s a bhoot,

01:06:16.908 --> 01:06:21.325
then I see that he suffers a little

01:06:21.981 --> 01:06:25.319
and faces it, the bhoot in him.

01:06:31.242 --> 01:06:34.894
For example somebody, I tell someone that

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:38.531
“Please do this” and he forgets completely about it,

01:06:38.792 --> 01:06:41.843
and he says it is a bhoot that has done.

01:06:48.498 --> 01:06:51.264
So then he loses his purse and then I say,

01:06:51.464 --> 01:06:54.286
“The bhoot must have taken away the purse!”

01:07:00.098 --> 01:07:03.513
But I experiment with Myself.

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:09.977
I first see how I should approach you.

01:07:10.246 --> 01:07:13.759
If it doesn’t work out I try something else

01:07:16.596 --> 01:07:18.685
within Myself,

01:07:18.885 --> 01:07:22.443
because it’s a very tricky time we are with.

01:07:26.939 --> 01:07:30.062
If we had gone according to the shariat

01:07:30.278 --> 01:07:32.570
of the chapter of Levi,

01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:36.294
all the bhoots would not have been here.

01:07:42.506 --> 01:07:46.102
Maybe no Sahaja yogis might have been left also.

01:07:50.622 --> 01:07:53.460
And this mental projection is such a common thing

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:56.343
that it’s difficult to detach people,

01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:59.596
but only way I can play tricks with you

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.947
is by experimenting Myself on you.

01:08:12.173 --> 01:08:14.996
In the same way you must play with yourself,

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:23.783
and try to put yourself in an experimental box.

01:08:39.663 --> 01:08:44.046
Today is the day of the Guru Puja,

01:08:44.305 --> 01:08:48.173
the day when you have to worship your Guru.

01:08:53.961 --> 01:09:00.086
You are really fortunate to have a Guru which is a Mother.

01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:10.824
And My mother and guru is this Mother Earth,

01:09:11.119 --> 01:09:15.195
which teaches Me how to deal with human beings.

01:09:24.287 --> 01:09:30.655
And she’s the one who also in every stage of difficulties

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:34.631
helps Me to correct

01:09:34.831 --> 01:09:43.159
My own methods of nirmala vidya.

01:09:53.079 --> 01:09:59.853
She has been such a kind mother and a kind guru to Me.

01:10:06.323 --> 01:10:09.788
And she’s such a soothing personality.

01:10:12.883 --> 01:10:17.926
This, all this green, though is given to her by sun as they say,

01:10:18.151 --> 01:10:22.109
is just to soothe us all.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.193
She wears the green upon herself,

01:10:32.364 --> 01:10:35.609
and the green is the Guru Principle.

01:10:39.961 --> 01:10:42.533
She’s the detached personality.

01:10:45.019 --> 01:10:46.663
She’s the magnetism,

01:10:47.995 --> 01:10:50.527
she attracts.

01:10:52.597 --> 01:10:58.726
When people are walking on her, she is looking after them.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:07.374
She creates out of her swayambus,

01:11:07.574 --> 01:11:09.887
the self

01:11:12.585 --> 01:11:15.211
– what should we say to swayambhu?

01:11:15.727 --> 01:11:18.647
– ah, yes, self-manifested stones.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:29.113
See, her attraction and her concern

01:11:29.337 --> 01:11:33.915
is so great that without her we would be hanging in the air.

01:11:40.885 --> 01:11:44.521
And she keeps Me to the brass tacks, as they say

01:11:44.723 --> 01:11:46.271
– to the reality.

01:11:51.105 --> 01:11:54.391
If I wanted I could be just the Spirit,

01:11:54.598 --> 01:11:57.573
and not bother about anybody else.

01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:06.109
The way she bears our sins,

01:12:06.309 --> 01:12:12.515
the way she always looks after us and nourishes us,

01:12:12.715 --> 01:12:15.951
despite our so many defects:

01:12:16.151 --> 01:12:19.024
in the same way a guru should do.

01:12:32.105 --> 01:12:34.753
She is extremely forgiving;

01:12:37.268 --> 01:12:38.977
but she explodes

01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:44.419
as an earthquake,

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:52.305
and sometimes hot calcium

01:12:52.673 --> 01:12:55.092
and hot potassium can come out of her.

01:13:01.912 --> 01:13:05.638
She produces sulphur for you, for your cure.

01:13:08.813 --> 01:13:13.656
If England’s soil becomes vibrated,

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:17.856
then this soil can be used for medicine.

01:13:24.438 --> 01:13:27.943
In India people use clay for medicine,

01:13:28.143 --> 01:13:30.142
for every kind of treatment.

01:13:36.517 --> 01:13:40.541
The understanding about Guru Tattwa

01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:43.314
one can have from the Mother Earth,

01:13:43.514 --> 01:13:48.097
so let us touch the Mother Earth and bow to her.

01:14:04.227 --> 01:14:07.227
May God bless you.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:23.082
She’s subtle!

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:46.708
In the Kundalini Shastra, Mother Earth is the Kundalini.

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:02.061
Mooladhara is the, is the Mother Earth.

01:15:06.563 --> 01:15:11.672
So for us kundalini is the most important thing.

01:15:14.281 --> 01:15:20.373
We don’t have to worry about what they have talked about

01:15:20.573 --> 01:15:25.856
in the Levi, that you must not steal, you must not tell lies;

01:15:26.056 --> 01:15:30.931
what we have to worry that keep your kundalini up.

01:15:41.256 --> 01:15:48.129
So the guru has to be a person who is absolutely practical.

01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:55.985
He must have common sense and absolutely practical,

01:15:56.256 --> 01:15:58.168
he cannot be impractical person.

01:16:01.484 --> 01:16:05.393
A person who’s impractical is not a guru.

01:16:08.232 --> 01:16:12.943
But practical in the common way is understood as a man

01:16:13.143 --> 01:16:16.389
who is cunning, who know how to deviate from right path

01:16:16.589 --> 01:16:20.881
and all that – that’s the most unpractical thing to do.

01:16:29.815 --> 01:16:33.137
Something absurd, something out of the blue

01:16:33.368 --> 01:16:36.743
is not the way a guru has to move.

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:45.592
There is all common sense which should

01:16:45.831 --> 01:16:49.831
guide a guru how to deal with a person,

01:16:57.502 --> 01:17:01.343
and common sense is a thing which is not

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:05.547
cunningness by any chance.

01:17:10.775 --> 01:17:13.911
The source of common sense is the spirit.

01:17:18.281 --> 01:17:24.364
The expression of a guru is very, very

01:17:26.711 --> 01:17:30.422
paradoxical – paradoxical.

01:17:34.656 --> 01:17:38.580
For example, a guru will be extremely practical,

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.336
supposing he has to build his own house,

01:17:41.536 --> 01:17:45.781
or a house or ashram or anything – be extremely practical.

01:17:50.521 --> 01:17:53.298
He will be very economical,

01:17:53.498 --> 01:17:56.511
he will create something out of the blue;

01:17:56.711 --> 01:17:59.572
people will be amazed how he’s done it so practical.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.493
But he’ll be so detached

01:18:05.693 --> 01:18:09.295
that if this ashram is to be donated to somebody,

01:18:09.495 --> 01:18:11.373
in one second he’ll donate.

01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:23.870
For acquiring – say, for example, for acquiring a lamp,

01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:26.103
the guru will be very practical,

01:18:26.303 --> 01:18:31.382
he’ll get the best and the cheapest and the most beautiful.

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:42.138
And he’ll be very intense about it.

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:46.095
But when it will come to giving,

01:18:46.295 --> 01:18:48.283
he’ll be more intense about it;

01:18:53.408 --> 01:18:56.597
that when he will give, he’ll give with that same intensity.

01:18:58.313 --> 01:19:00.967
He’ll find out all practical methods how to donate,

01:19:01.167 --> 01:19:03.694
also to give away.

01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:12.724
So his acquiring is actually giving.

01:19:17.715 --> 01:19:19.860
He acquires to give,

01:19:21.499 --> 01:19:24.498
that’s how he is the most practical.

01:19:27.586 --> 01:19:32.336
You know that we cannot take anything with us.

01:19:39.173 --> 01:19:43.074
Only the guru can take with him something,

01:19:46.606 --> 01:19:48.428
nobody else can take.

01:19:51.413 --> 01:19:56.785
Only the guru has all the disciples and disciples,

01:19:56.985 --> 01:20:01.219
and disciples and disciples for ages,

01:20:01.419 --> 01:20:03.744
who sing the praise.

01:20:13.242 --> 01:20:17.303
No other relationship is that eternal.

01:20:20.722 --> 01:20:24.806
It goes on reflecting for ages and ages and ages.

01:20:28.695 --> 01:20:32.737
It’s one wave that falls and then disappears;

01:20:33.012 --> 01:20:37.276
in anything that you do every wave has disappears,

01:20:37.476 --> 01:20:41.768
but not the wave of knowledge from a guru.

01:20:47.503 --> 01:20:54.921
It’s even higher than the Divine Principle,

01:20:59.223 --> 01:21:02.440
because it explains.

01:21:08.139 --> 01:21:10.633
The Divine Principle cannot explain

01:21:13.169 --> 01:21:15.545
– it’s the guru who explains it.

01:21:18.862 --> 01:21:22.195
Not that it manifests, but it’s explains and it works out,

01:21:22.416 --> 01:21:26.957
so he’s the master of the Divine Power.

01:21:33.047 --> 01:21:38.594
So in a way, Divine Power is like the meaning of the guru.

01:21:43.781 --> 01:21:46.537
Like the word has the meaning,

01:21:46.737 --> 01:21:50.880
and the word – I’m sorry, the word has the meaning,

01:21:51.104 --> 01:21:54.245
and the word serves the meaning.

01:21:59.254 --> 01:22:05.918
But in a Guru Principle, the Divine serves the guru.

01:22:13.748 --> 01:22:17.332
Everything is at your disposal.

01:22:18.483 --> 01:22:20.653
Everything is at your disposal.

01:22:23.463 --> 01:22:25.110
When you are a guru,

01:22:26.111 --> 01:22:27.663
all your chakras

01:22:29.439 --> 01:22:31.017
are at your disposal.

01:22:32.424 --> 01:22:34.780
All the universe is at your disposal,

01:22:36.007 --> 01:22:37.344
because you are the guru.

01:22:38.243 --> 01:22:40.881
It’s like the director of the show

01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:47.616
– the stage man,

01:22:47.824 --> 01:22:49.752
the gentleman who is in charge of the lights,

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.173
the gentleman who is in charge of the loud-speaker,

01:22:52.373 --> 01:22:55.225
everybody has to serve the director,

01:23:03.741 --> 01:23:06.847
because he is training the actors.

01:23:09.601 --> 01:23:16.851
But the Guru Principle has to be so much unchallenged.

01:23:17.177 --> 01:23:18.985
It should be of such a capacity

01:23:19.185 --> 01:23:21.273
that nobody can challenge that,

01:23:21.481 --> 01:23:25.057
it should be such a capable personality

01:23:25.278 --> 01:23:28.782
that nobody should be able to challenge the guru.

01:23:28.987 --> 01:23:31.506
Then only it will work out.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.163
So you have to work it out in such a way

01:23:46.363 --> 01:23:49.826
that you are absolutely unchallengeable.

01:23:53.337 --> 01:23:57.348
And you are specially fortunate

01:23:57.548 --> 01:24:01.215
that you can see yourself and correct yourself,

01:24:01.481 --> 01:24:05.230
which nobody could do before – you are your own guru.

01:24:13.355 --> 01:24:17.098
This situation never, never happened.

01:24:20.747 --> 01:24:23.044
You are your own guru

01:24:24.944 --> 01:24:27.987
– and let Me be your Mother.

01:24:30.174 --> 01:24:34.341
That would be the best for Me.

01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:43.410
So today is the day when one has to determine

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:51.356
how far you are a guru, first point.

01:24:52.424 --> 01:24:56.174
You have to take a pledge

01:24:56.587 --> 01:25:00.337
that you will establish your Guru Principle,

01:25:01.801 --> 01:25:04.134
second point.

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:08.377
Thirdly, you have to pledge that

01:25:09.051 --> 01:25:14.225
you will establish Guru Principles in others.

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:43.487
Fourthly, you have to know that there is a little snag,

01:25:44.192 --> 01:25:47.441
that your Guru is a Mother.

01:25:51.082 --> 01:25:53.677
She’s too kind to be a guru,

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:58.186
too mild to be a guru,

01:25:59.908 --> 01:26:02.072
and extremely tolerant.

01:26:04.395 --> 01:26:07.502
So it is better that you take up this strictness

01:26:07.702 --> 01:26:11.063
towards yourself, and look after yourself.

01:26:15.662 --> 01:26:19.062
May God bless you.

01:26:23.203 --> 01:26:26.098
So you become your own guru.

01:26:39.707 --> 01:26:44.041
On every Guru day I have a problem,

01:26:45.132 --> 01:26:49.506
and one of the problems is – you may translate, Gregoire,

01:26:49.786 --> 01:26:53.078
still a little more, if you don’t mind

01:26:58.694 --> 01:27:01.861
– on every Guru Puja day I think I should become

01:27:02.064 --> 01:27:05.730
a complete Guru, and at least on one day

01:27:05.953 --> 01:27:08.828
I should not be a Mother.

01:27:16.368 --> 01:27:21.430
But every time I try these tricks it works against Me!

01:27:29.772 --> 01:27:32.605
Last year in India I told them that

01:27:32.836 --> 01:27:34.514
“This time I am going to be just Guru,

01:27:34.714 --> 01:27:37.193
and you have to only give Me a shawl

01:27:37.438 --> 01:27:41.830
and I will not take any sari, and nothing like a Mother.”

01:27:49.643 --> 01:27:52.087
And I was very stern with them, and I said,

01:27:52.287 --> 01:27:55.904
“At any cost I am not going to take a sari, whatever you may do.”

01:28:00.238 --> 01:28:02.738
And they were very unhappy because they had bought

01:28:03.018 --> 01:28:04.954
a sari for Me, and they said,

01:28:05.154 --> 01:28:07.070
“We have also stitched a blouse and a petticoat,

01:28:07.331 --> 01:28:10.813
and Mother, You must accept. You are our Mother also.”

01:28:22.363 --> 01:28:25.363
So I said, “I am going to be very hard like a guru,

01:28:25.608 --> 01:28:29.430
and nothing doing, today nothing is going to convince Me.”

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:39.915
Because again you become the Mother,

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:44.157
then the whole thing becomes again that soft business!

01:28:49.649 --> 01:28:52.993
[Yogi: Mother, I can’t translate that!]

01:28:54.295 --> 01:28:55.612
You’d better tell them!

01:29:03.867 --> 01:29:10.242
So I went to open the, you see, a tap

01:29:10.476 --> 01:29:13.212
– because in India we don’t believe in wash-basins,

01:29:13.412 --> 01:29:15.428
you see – to wash My hands.

01:29:28.665 --> 01:29:30.871
And Indian taps as they are, you see,

01:29:31.071 --> 01:29:35.447
it gave in and I got completely drenched.

01:29:41.733 --> 01:29:43.349
And I came out and I said,

01:29:43.549 --> 01:29:47.158
“Please give Me the sari to wear!”

01:30:01.206 --> 01:30:03.796
Today I had decided to be a real guru,

01:30:03.996 --> 01:30:06.913
and a very hard one.

01:30:16.754 --> 01:30:18.454
Then Warren came to say that

01:30:18.654 --> 01:30:20.681
“Mother, somebody has bought a sari,

01:30:20.881 --> 01:30:23.001
and this is that and that is that.”

01:30:23.222 --> 01:30:25.830
He gave lots of arguments.

01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:37.724
And Rustom and Warren were trying to, you see,

01:30:37.924 --> 01:30:40.955
put Me down in My place.

01:30:47.681 --> 01:30:54.681
But then they used the greatest argument to outwit Me.

01:31:00.579 --> 01:31:03.038
First they said, “The sari is beautiful,” this, that

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.544
– I was all right then.

01:31:08.837 --> 01:31:11.307
But then they said, “The vibrations are too good.

01:31:11.507 --> 01:31:15.016
Even before opening the sari, the vibrations were there.”

01:31:21.961 --> 01:31:25.420
So all My efforts fizzled out!

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:34.916
This is the play of the sweetness of Divine,

01:31:41.236 --> 01:31:44.242
what is called as madhurya.

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:51.558
“Madhurya” means the sweetness, the sweetness.

01:31:52.111 --> 01:31:56.132
And this is the one

01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:01.749
that’s such a hide-and-seek of joy in life,

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.356
and that is what I have accepted.

01:32:10.556 --> 01:32:14.440
So first we’ll have the Mother’s Puja.

01:33:16.267 --> 01:33:19.965
First is Shri Ganesha and then Gauri Puja today;

01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:23.795
because of the Guru Puja we’ll have Gauri Puja.

01:34:47.988 --> 01:34:50.404
Sahaja Yogi: All those who have never yet washed

01:34:50.669 --> 01:34:56.002
the feet of Shri Mataji and who would like to take,

01:34:56.453 --> 01:34:57.956
to have this great privilege,

01:34:58.212 --> 01:35:02.128
should come forward to do the puja.

01:35:04.083 --> 01:35:06.875
You’d better like it!

01:35:09.099 --> 01:35:12.515
Don’t leave it to their freedom, better like it!

01:35:13.135 --> 01:35:16.302
If you leave it to their freedom …

01:35:18.208 --> 01:35:20.541
And somebody must tell Me their names, you see;

01:35:20.833 --> 01:35:22.208
I would like to know their names,

01:35:22.499 --> 01:35:25.478
all those who are washing My feet, that would be good.

01:39:40.031 --> 01:39:43.795
If you are on the sides, it would be better like this …

01:39:57.126 --> 01:39:58.889
It’s all right. Twenty-one names.

01:39:59.126 --> 01:40:00.508
Alll right, if you finish that,

01:40:00.708 --> 01:40:02.634
then they will come down.

01:40:05.672 --> 01:40:06.897
You guide them.

01:43:41.084 --> 01:43:42.368
Loudly.

01:43:44.708 --> 01:43:45.708
All right.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.792
Now, let the – you guide the coming here, one by one.

01:43:51.084 --> 01:43:52.750
Two of them can come.

01:43:53.042 --> 01:43:54.501
From the same country would be better

01:43:54.808 --> 01:43:57.451
so they can tell Me their ….

01:44:13.536 --> 01:44:14.736
What is your name?

01:44:44.033 --> 01:44:45.375
Rub it hard.

01:45:21.172 --> 01:45:22.807
All the chakras

01:46:23.278 --> 01:46:24.798
Warm water.

01:46:36.851 --> 01:46:38.692
be careful about that

01:46:40.867 --> 01:46:41.867
be caredul

01:46:42.894 --> 01:46:45.610
Just put it that side a little bit, carefully.

01:46:47.387 --> 01:46:48.520
Tell me your name

01:47:01.464 --> 01:47:02.464
Shawn?

01:47:13.661 --> 01:47:18.256
Christian. You have to tell that  becasue just now, all right?

01:47:18.467 --> 01:47:20.607
Christian, all right?

01:47:22.418 --> 01:47:25.596
Rub it hard. Rub it hard. Hard. Harder.

01:47:27.337 --> 01:47:29.379
Hard. Hard. Harder.

01:48:19.787 --> 01:48:20.898
All right?!

01:48:46.641 --> 01:48:47.641
God bless you!

01:48:57.768 --> 01:48:58.902
From where?

01:49:11.517 --> 01:49:13.917
Rub it hard. Rub it hard, all right?

01:49:25.414 --> 01:49:26.414
Hard. hard.

Ask them to rub their hands like this before comming here. all of them.

01:50:09.905 --> 01:50:11.172
See the vibrations.

01:50:14.067 --> 01:50:15.067
All right?

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:34.855
Now, tell me your names.

01:50:36.854 --> 01:50:38.021
Loudly

01:50:44.351 --> 01:50:45.766
From which country?

01:50:52.153 --> 01:50:54.553
Rub it hard. Rub it hard.

01:50:56.377 --> 01:50:58.534
Hard. Hard. Harder.

01:51:03.993 --> 01:51:04.993
Hard.

01:52:01.157 --> 01:52:02.503
Take away these

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:14.018
...put it here

01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:16.290
Put it here.

01:52:35.850 --> 01:52:38.562
Such cool breeze has started ...

01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:45.970
Hello. Now

01:52:46.937 --> 01:52:48.779
Tell me again your name

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:02.321
Oh, may God bless you

01:53:02.521 --> 01:53:04.397
I did not get your name

01:53:29.699 --> 01:53:30.699
Rub it hard.

01:53:32.286 --> 01:53:33.907
Harder harder

Thank you. Thank you very mauch. Beautiful.

01:55:38.728 --> 01:55:40.036
Rub my feet.

01:55:42.859 --> 01:55:44.586
Hard. Rub it hard.

01:55:45.348 --> 01:55:46.348
Hard.

01:56:20.095 --> 01:56:21.228
Probably it is...

01:56:28.155 --> 01:56:30.356
...

01:57:10.422 --> 01:57:12.876
You want blessing?!

01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:14.602
Hard. Hard. Very hard.

01:58:15.841 --> 01:58:16.841
Rub it hard.

01:58:18.978 --> 01:58:19.988
Very hard.

01:58:20.203 --> 01:58:21.454

Hard. Very hard.

01:58:42.891 --> 01:58:44.091
May God bless you.

01:59:45.079 --> 01:59:46.212
Tell me your name.

02:00:08.865 --> 02:00:10.265
Rub hard. Very hard.

02:00:16.027 --> 02:00:17.027
Very hard.

02:01:09.222 --> 02:01:13.088
Thank you, thank you.

02:01:26.219 --> 02:01:28.594
Olympia?

02:01:28.801 --> 02:01:32.468
Hah! All right, that’s it.

02:02:11.505 --> 02:02:14.414
May God bless you.

02:02:32.779 --> 02:02:34.530
How many there are still more.

02:02:34.730 --> 02:02:36.997
Let's have four and four together.

02:02:40.225 --> 02:02:41.863
Now tell me the name.

02:02:58.751 --> 02:02:59.757
Rub it hard.

02:02:59.957 --> 02:03:01.098
Rub it. Rub it hard.

02:03:01.298 --> 02:03:02.364
Hard, very hard.

02:03:30.407 --> 02:03:31.407
Good.

02:13:32.154 --> 02:13:37.405
Hah! Good. All right. Rub My feet.

02:13:55.323 --> 02:13:56.323
Rub My feet.

02:14:05.192 --> 02:14:07.984
All these names have to do with various qualities

02:14:08.275 --> 02:14:09.692
with which He rules the ganas.

02:14:10.026 --> 02:14:14.068
The ganas are the soldiers of the left side,

02:14:14.442 --> 02:14:16.026
who are the protectors of Lord Shiva

02:14:16.317 --> 02:14:18.761
and of the blessed Gauri.

02:14:18.961 --> 02:14:20.536
Who get after your bhoots!

02:14:20.736 --> 02:14:22.536
Who get after the bhoot!

02:14:23.233 --> 02:14:25.633
People should take special interest.

02:14:30.609 --> 02:14:33.567
Come along. Come forward, yes. Come forward please.

02:14:33.859 --> 02:14:35.784
Now, tell Me the names.

02:14:42.484 --> 02:14:46.192
Margaret. Yes, what’s yours?

02:14:48.275 --> 02:14:52.550
You’re from? From where? …

02:15:00.526 --> 02:15:03.234
Very hard. Rub them very hard, all right?

02:15:03.969 --> 02:15:07.163
Rub them hard. Hard, very hard.

02:16:03.752 --> 02:16:06.831
Forgive, forgive, forgive

02:16:47.702 --> 02:16:48.702
Hah! Now!

02:16:53.563 --> 02:16:55.163
Still there.

02:16:56.194 --> 02:16:58.936
Now there’ll be no problem.

02:17:20.936 --> 02:17:24.519
Now tell Me the names.

02:17:28.431 --> 02:17:29.973
Catherine.

02:17:30.009 --> 02:17:32.262
From what country?

02:18:09.985 --> 02:18:13.235
Now come along, rub My feet.

02:18:37.973 --> 02:18:40.831
Rub it hard. Harder, hard.

02:19:21.749 --> 02:19:22.958
All right?

02:19:38.627 --> 02:19:44.378
Good? May God bless you.

02:20:04.714 --> 02:20:06.173
Hah! Better?

02:20:36.222 --> 02:20:39.763
… Tell Me your names.

02:20:42.109 --> 02:20:46.317
Now, what’s the country you come from?

02:20:51.359 --> 02:20:54.317
All right, now you rub My feet.

02:20:54.692 --> 02:20:57.651
Both the hands.

02:20:58.014 --> 02:21:02.317
Hard; really hard, very hard.

02:21:05.026 --> 02:21:06.442
Hard, very hard. Harder. Good.

02:21:43.818 --> 02:21:47.109
Aha! May God bless you. Good.

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:51.651
See yourself. See your hands.

02:21:57.899 --> 02:22:02.524
All right. What about you?

02:22:05.728 --> 02:22:09.811
All right. May God bless you.

02:22:26.931 --> 02:22:28.639
Maria?

02:22:28.503 --> 02:22:30.545
From what country?

02:22:32.622 --> 02:22:33.456
France.

02:22:38.484 --> 02:22:40.484
You have to tell Me very clearly,

02:22:40.818 --> 02:22:42.943
because you are telling the deities, all right?

02:22:43.275 --> 02:22:45.901
Now, rub My feet.

02:22:46.567 --> 02:22:48.859
Rub My feet hard.

02:22:49.192 --> 02:22:53.109
Hard. Very hard.

02:23:34.108 --> 02:23:35.400
Tremendous!

02:23:45.275 --> 02:23:46.359
Hah! Good. Let Me see.

02:23:58.567 --> 02:23:59.776
All right?

02:24:46.167 --> 02:24:48.959
Now tell Me your names.

02:24:51.609 --> 02:24:54.442
From where?

02:24:59.317 --> 02:25:01.400
France.

02:25:02.234 --> 02:25:07.901
Again? Again? From France.

02:25:08.442 --> 02:25:11.109
You have to tell Me, because My ears have to hear,

02:25:11.526 --> 02:25:14.526
so the deities must hear, all right?

02:25:14.859 --> 02:25:17.526
Now, please rub My feet.

02:25:19.109 --> 02:25:21.859
Hard, hard, hard.

02:25:24.237 --> 02:25:25.403
Very hard.

02:25:26.859 --> 02:25:30.234
Yes, that’s it. Hard, hard …

02:26:18.901 --> 02:26:22.234
Put your hands towards Me.

02:26:40.108 --> 02:26:45.026
All right? May God bless you.

02:27:03.359 --> 02:27:06.670
Hello, how are you? May God bless you.

02:27:06.943 --> 02:27:10.818
How are you now, better? How is the baby?

02:27:12.068 --> 02:27:16.192
Now good. Tell Me your names very clearly, loudly.

02:27:18.317 --> 02:27:22.901
Sally, from Australia. Say like this.

02:27:26.984 --> 02:27:31.234
All right. You’re also from England, originally?

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:34.943
All right, then say that …

02:27:44.192 --> 02:27:51.943
All right, rub My feet. Rub My feet hard. Very hard.

02:29:30.526 --> 02:29:34.943
Did you go to some false guru?

02:29:48.689 --> 02:29:50.109
Hah! Better?

02:30:30.901 --> 02:30:32.484
Now you have to tell your names

02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:34.985
and the country’s names, all right?

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:39.484
Now, tell your, your name?

02:30:44.086 --> 02:30:46.961
From where?

02:30:47.514 --> 02:30:49.182
From?

02:30:50.234 --> 02:30:51.192
All right.

02:30:52.584 --> 02:30:54.292
Come along.

02:30:56.244 --> 02:31:00.041
Rub hard, very hard.

02:31:41.533 --> 02:31:44.091
See your hands now.

02:31:52.359 --> 02:31:56.859
All right? May God bless you.

02:32:15.526 --> 02:32:17.234
You have to tell them your name,

02:32:17.609 --> 02:32:20.776
and your country’s name.

02:32:23.984 --> 02:32:26.442
From Africa?

02:32:26.776 --> 02:32:29.692
From India, sorry!

02:32:36.275 --> 02:32:39.234
Hard, very hard. Harder.

02:32:39.567 --> 02:32:41.984
Very hard. As much as you can.

02:32:42.192 --> 02:32:46.651
Harder. Very hard.

02:32:46.984 --> 02:32:50.901
Hard, very hard.

02:32:52.691 --> 02:32:55.635
Very hard.Very hard.Very hard.

02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:15.234
As much as you can.

02:34:29.442 --> 02:34:34.609
Come along, how are you?

02:34:34.984 --> 02:34:36.984
Wash My feet.

02:34:37.317 --> 02:34:40.317
This one here, wash it.

02:34:40.651 --> 02:34:43.442
Hello, how are you? … How are you?

02:34:53.692 --> 02:34:58.068
I must see you. How long are you going to be here?

02:34:59.359 --> 02:35:00.859
All right, come along.

02:35:01.108 --> 02:35:03.192
Take plenty of time, all right?

02:35:05.901 --> 02:35:07.692
Good, good, good.

02:35:07.917 --> 02:35:10.460
Now see, just see the vibrations.

02:35:30.026 --> 02:35:33.073
See how are your hands.

02:35:47.859 --> 02:35:50.526
Ah, all right?

02:35:51.109 --> 02:35:54.150
Good. Sister has got it.

02:35:54.526 --> 02:35:58.984
Now, she has got it. He has got it.

02:36:03.859 --> 02:36:05.400
May God bless you all.

02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:09.068
May God bless you.

02:36:09.484 --> 02:36:12.484
May God bless you.

02:36:26.901 --> 02:36:30.943
That’s good. Now, you tell Me your name,

02:36:31.192 --> 02:36:34.609
and also the country you are from. Tell Me.

02:36:38.317 --> 02:36:39.651
All right.

02:36:39.943 --> 02:36:44.109
Rub it hard, very hard.

02:36:44.442 --> 02:36:47.026
Very hard.

02:37:37.859 --> 02:37:39.192
All right?

02:37:39.458 --> 02:37:41.416
Good.

02:37:57.068 --> 02:37:59.859
Now put your hands towards Me.

02:38:09.275 --> 02:38:11.442
All right?

02:38:17.943 --> 02:38:20.567
Great! May God bless you.

02:38:43.438 --> 02:38:46.639
Tell your name and where you are coming from.

02:38:46.814 --> 02:38:47.814
Loudly.

02:39:00.656 --> 02:39:03.300
Rub it hard, very hard.

02:39:22.661 --> 02:39:24.342
Let him play.

02:39:51.016 --> 02:39:52.471
It is good.

02:42:39.363 --> 02:42:40.630
May God bless you.

02:42:41.006 --> 02:42:42.456
Now you have become gurus, all right?

02:42:42.826 --> 02:42:45.293
You have become gurus, remember that!

02:42:45.515 --> 02:42:46.515
Come along.

02:42:46.778 --> 02:42:51.288
If anyone has a newly born child, who has not yet met Mataji,

02:42:51.428 --> 02:42:56.275
Shri Mataji would ... her at the end of the feet washing.

02:42:57.822 --> 02:43:00.202
All have been to me

02:43:18.383 --> 02:43:20.841
You have to tell the deities.

02:43:21.216 --> 02:43:24.016
I know you, the deities must know you too.

02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:25.720
All right

02:43:27.133 --> 02:43:29.133
I am happy if you rub it hard. Hard. Hard. Hard.

02:46:55.643 --> 02:46:57.184
Come along. They have washed My feet,

02:46:57.518 --> 02:46:58.809
but I’ll have to bless the child.

02:46:59.142 --> 02:47:02.518
Ah, so what’s the name?

02:47:05.768 --> 02:47:08.601
Ah, look at the eyes, ah? That’s the sign.

02:47:08.912 --> 02:47:12.037
That’s Me, you see, the eyes are Me, can’t you see?

02:47:12.351 --> 02:47:14.601
Can I have a little water?

02:47:15.184 --> 02:47:17.518
So what’s the name?

02:47:18.351 --> 02:47:19.809
James, eh?

02:47:20.100 --> 02:47:23.351
Will You give him another name?

02:48:05.808 --> 02:48:14.768
You could call him Ewan. Ewan, for English, all right?

02:48:15.184 --> 02:48:18.559
And for the Indian name …

02:48:39.309 --> 02:48:40.392
Gyanadev.

02:48:45.267 --> 02:48:48.226
He smiled, he smiled!

02:48:50.267 --> 02:48:54.768
You are smiling, Gyanadeva – Gyaneshwara.

02:49:00.726 --> 02:49:02.518
May God bless you.

02:49:03.850 --> 02:49:07.184
He’s smiling, see – so very happy!

02:49:15.850 --> 02:49:20.226
All right. Can you wipe My feet?

02:54:24.267 --> 02:54:27.392
Now, you give it all there, give it all.

02:54:33.142 --> 02:54:35.809
That’s all. You don’t use milk.

02:54:36.434 --> 02:54:39.559
You can add it later, milk.

02:54:45.518 --> 02:54:50.601
Sadkara. Sadkara. Sadkara.

02:57:50.434 --> 02:57:54.097
Now say the mantra of “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu …” three times.

02:59:19.934 --> 02:59:23.434
Give Me the towel.

02:59:36.184 --> 02:59:38.059
Very slowly, you should let down the air

02:59:38.434 --> 02:59:39.892
very slowly, all right?

02:59:40.184 --> 02:59:43.267
Now can it be put down, so that they can do it.

02:59:43.601 --> 02:59:47.017
Danielle, come. Take this down. Come along.

02:59:50.142 --> 02:59:51.850
Danielle is going to help you.

02:59:52.184 --> 02:59:55.184
You put the mark in, all right?

03:01:11.476 --> 03:01:12.768
Thank you very much.

03:01:13.017 --> 03:01:14.559
You all have to put something there.

03:01:14.892 --> 03:01:18.809
Come along! Thank you. Come down, come down.
