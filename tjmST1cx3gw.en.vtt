00:16.640 --> 00:20.640
here you are

00:18.480 --> 00:23.520
in such a great position that you have

00:20.640 --> 00:23.520
got realization

00:24.000 --> 00:32.160
that only thing you have to accept

00:28.640 --> 00:32.160
the beauty of this

00:32.800 --> 00:40.000
great yoga that

00:36.000 --> 00:43.520
you just enlighten

00:40.000 --> 00:47.200
your own powers which are

00:43.520 --> 00:51.440
on these seven chakras now let us see

00:47.200 --> 00:55.520
the first chakra belongs to the power

00:51.440 --> 00:59.840
of gauri the power of the

00:55.520 --> 00:59.840
mother of shri ganesha

01:02.480 --> 01:06.960
gauri's power tremendous there aren't

01:05.360 --> 01:09.280
they

01:06.960 --> 01:10.960
because of her power you have got your

01:09.280 --> 01:13.840
realization

01:10.960 --> 01:13.840
now what have we done

01:16.080 --> 01:20.720
to enshrine that power within ourselves

01:21.119 --> 01:24.479
today's if it is the first day of

01:23.520 --> 01:28.400
navratri

01:24.479 --> 01:28.400
let us see what have we done

01:31.280 --> 01:35.040
have we been able to develop our

01:34.000 --> 01:41.759
innocence

01:35.040 --> 01:45.280
within ourselves

01:41.759 --> 01:48.720
when people talk they are so sharp

01:45.280 --> 01:51.759
how can you be sharp if you are innocent

01:48.720 --> 01:51.759
they are so bumptious

01:52.000 --> 01:58.320
how can you be that if you are innocent

01:55.119 --> 02:02.479
people play games how can you do that

01:58.320 --> 02:06.640
if you are innocent harm each other

02:02.479 --> 02:09.920
how can it be if you are innocent

02:06.640 --> 02:13.120
so first of all you have to see yourself

02:09.920 --> 02:13.680
that the power of innocence if it has to

02:13.120 --> 02:15.520
live

02:13.680 --> 02:17.760
all the rest of the nonsense has to go

02:15.520 --> 02:17.760
away

02:20.480 --> 02:26.560
if you want to have the innocence all

02:24.000 --> 02:28.800
that is anti-innocence has to be dropped

02:26.560 --> 02:28.800
off

02:29.920 --> 02:33.440
i can understand about people who are

02:32.239 --> 02:36.560
ignorant

02:33.440 --> 02:37.040
who have ignorance then in ignorance of

02:36.560 --> 02:39.519
course

02:37.040 --> 02:41.040
how will they talk of innocence but you

02:39.519 --> 02:43.680
are not ignorant people

02:41.040 --> 02:45.840
you are knowledgeable you've got your

02:43.680 --> 02:49.280
enlightenment

02:45.840 --> 02:51.440
and the power of innocence is so great

02:49.280 --> 02:53.920
it makes you absolutely fearless not

02:51.440 --> 02:56.160
bombshell but fearless

02:53.920 --> 02:59.360
and the greatest thing of innocence is

02:56.160 --> 02:59.360
that you are respectful

03:00.800 --> 03:07.920
the sense of respect

03:05.200 --> 03:08.560
if it is not developed within you if you

03:07.920 --> 03:11.200
cannot

03:08.560 --> 03:13.040
develop the sense of respect for other

03:11.200 --> 03:16.239
sahaja yogis

03:13.040 --> 03:17.519
for other people for the ashrams for the

03:16.239 --> 03:21.040
discipline

03:17.519 --> 03:21.040
and your own self-respect

03:21.280 --> 03:26.560
then it is of no use

03:24.480 --> 03:27.680
even talking of sahaja yoga because

03:26.560 --> 03:30.480
that's the very

03:27.680 --> 03:30.480
beginning of it

03:30.799 --> 03:34.959
first you do not respect all right you

03:33.120 --> 03:38.720
are bumped us all right

03:34.959 --> 03:38.720
you are in a big

03:38.959 --> 03:43.920
fool's paradise as they call it riding a

03:41.840 --> 03:46.319
fast horse

03:43.920 --> 03:47.440
all that is there is all right is

03:46.319 --> 03:50.560
forgiven

03:47.440 --> 03:54.239
but once you have seen the light you

03:50.560 --> 03:56.560
must try to

03:54.239 --> 04:01.840
get rid of all the snakes that you have

03:56.560 --> 04:01.840
been holding on

04:02.560 --> 04:05.760
is a simple thing

04:05.920 --> 04:09.920
in your childlike nature only

04:10.159 --> 04:14.239
you can receive the blessings of gauri

04:12.640 --> 04:17.199
otherwise you cannot

04:14.239 --> 04:18.479
you have to be really childlike

04:17.199 --> 04:22.079
otherwise

04:18.479 --> 04:22.400
it is absolutely useless no use telling

04:22.079 --> 04:24.320
you

04:22.400 --> 04:25.520
anything because you think you are too

04:24.320 --> 04:27.199
clever

04:25.520 --> 04:29.360
to such a person who thinks he's too

04:27.199 --> 04:30.720
clever was this of talking to such a

04:29.360 --> 04:33.199
person because he already knows

04:30.720 --> 04:33.199
everything

04:33.600 --> 04:38.320
so the first power when you develop you

04:36.639 --> 04:41.520
must learn to sit on the

04:38.320 --> 04:41.520
mother earth first of all

04:41.759 --> 04:45.919
you must respect the mother earth

04:44.000 --> 04:47.759
because the first chakra is made out of

04:45.919 --> 04:50.960
the mother earth

04:47.759 --> 04:53.680
try to be more settle down with yourself

04:50.960 --> 04:53.680
on mother earth

04:55.199 --> 05:02.960
under respect see the trees

04:58.560 --> 05:05.680
when they get their flowers

05:02.960 --> 05:06.960
they are not so respectful but when they

05:05.680 --> 05:10.479
are leading by

05:06.960 --> 05:13.199
the fruits they bow down

05:10.479 --> 05:13.199
to mother earth

05:14.000 --> 05:18.479
in the same way when you have got the

05:17.199 --> 05:25.840
fruits

05:18.479 --> 05:25.840
of sahaja yoga you all must bow down

05:26.240 --> 05:35.360
and innocence has a special capacity

05:30.560 --> 05:35.360
to make a person extremely peaceful

05:36.000 --> 05:44.080
extremely peaceful all the

05:39.520 --> 05:47.840
anger temper violence

05:44.080 --> 05:50.560
if a person doesn't have innocence

05:47.840 --> 05:50.560
it cannot

05:51.199 --> 05:56.400
come in you because the person who is

05:54.000 --> 05:59.600
not innocent

05:56.400 --> 06:02.240
is either sly or

05:59.600 --> 06:02.240
aggressive

06:03.039 --> 06:07.840
he cannot have peace within his heart

06:05.919 --> 06:09.440
but an innocent person is not bothered

06:07.840 --> 06:12.479
innocently he lives

06:09.440 --> 06:15.520
enjoys everything in complete

06:12.479 --> 06:15.520
peace and harmony

06:17.759 --> 06:26.080
but this violence comes

06:21.759 --> 06:28.319
when a person becomes clever

06:26.080 --> 06:29.600
he thinks i am so clever the another one

06:28.319 --> 06:34.000
is so stupid

06:29.600 --> 06:37.840
i have a right to shout at that person

06:34.000 --> 06:41.600
and the one who is not innocent is

06:37.840 --> 06:43.520
never wise he may be to look at look

06:41.600 --> 06:48.400
sharp but he's not wise

06:43.520 --> 06:48.800
wisdom comes only with innocence and how

06:48.400 --> 06:52.080
much

06:48.800 --> 06:52.080
wisdom have you gathered

06:55.120 --> 07:02.000
that is what one has to say when

06:58.479 --> 07:05.199
your power

07:02.000 --> 07:08.319
of innocence increases wisdom

07:05.199 --> 07:10.479
is apparent people say that fellow is

07:08.319 --> 07:12.800
very wise

07:10.479 --> 07:14.560
for example if somebody is crying about

07:12.800 --> 07:17.360
his wife

07:14.560 --> 07:18.080
a wise person we could say obama just

07:17.360 --> 07:21.120
look at this

07:18.080 --> 07:22.880
still busy with his wife another one is

07:21.120 --> 07:23.360
crying about his house or something he

07:22.880 --> 07:25.759
say oh

07:23.360 --> 07:28.080
look at this one still busy with the

07:25.759 --> 07:28.080
house

07:28.560 --> 07:31.919
there is no end to it

07:34.160 --> 07:42.479
i have known people who get

07:37.360 --> 07:44.160
so swollen up

07:42.479 --> 07:47.280
that they think they must give a big

07:44.160 --> 07:47.280
lecture for one hour

07:47.360 --> 07:52.240
on sahaja yoga unless and until they

07:49.599 --> 07:54.560
have given one hour lecture

07:52.240 --> 07:57.759
they do not think their ego has

07:54.560 --> 08:01.520
manifested itself fully

07:57.759 --> 08:02.080
but a wise person he doesn't have to

08:01.520 --> 08:06.160
talk

08:02.080 --> 08:06.160
or speak or do anything

08:06.319 --> 08:14.879
he impresses his silence

08:09.680 --> 08:17.680
his wisdom on others much more easily

08:14.879 --> 08:18.879
and that is what we have to see have we

08:17.680 --> 08:21.599
been able

08:18.879 --> 08:23.199
to discipline ourselves because our

08:21.599 --> 08:25.919
growth is very

08:23.199 --> 08:26.400
much in the beginning of it you have to

08:25.919 --> 08:29.120
grow

08:26.400 --> 08:29.120
quite a lot

08:29.440 --> 08:36.159
and people don't understand this point

08:32.479 --> 08:39.519
in an atmosphere of egoistical

08:36.159 --> 08:42.560
temperament that you have to grow

08:39.519 --> 08:45.919
you have not yet grown

08:42.560 --> 08:45.919
you have to grow a lot

08:46.880 --> 08:55.519
and when you grow you find this wisdom

08:51.040 --> 09:00.560
really fragrant with compassion

08:55.519 --> 09:00.560
your wisdom is fragrant with compassion

09:01.279 --> 09:05.279
such beautiful compassion

09:05.360 --> 09:11.760
can emit through your being

09:09.440 --> 09:12.880
that anybody who comes in contact with

09:11.760 --> 09:16.399
you

09:12.880 --> 09:16.399
will feel your auspiciousness

09:17.760 --> 09:25.200
but again

09:21.760 --> 09:26.640
you must give due respect to your

09:25.200 --> 09:29.600
self-realization

09:26.640 --> 09:32.640
and to yourself that is the first thing

09:29.600 --> 09:34.839
you have to do is to meditate

09:32.640 --> 09:37.200
we are not drinking we do not have

09:34.839 --> 09:40.320
hangovers

09:37.200 --> 09:40.320
we don't sleep late

09:40.880 --> 09:46.800
so why shouldn't we decide today that

09:44.000 --> 09:48.560
every morning i'll get up and do my

09:46.800 --> 09:51.200
meditation

09:48.560 --> 09:54.720
and while meditating i must concentrate

09:51.200 --> 09:54.720
on myself and not on others

09:55.360 --> 09:58.959
and see for myself what is catching

09:57.440 --> 09:59.680
where am i catching what chakra i am

09:58.959 --> 10:03.279
coaching

09:59.680 --> 10:04.800
whatever to do so on this day of

10:03.279 --> 10:08.000
navratri

10:04.800 --> 10:11.120
today as the first day

10:08.000 --> 10:14.160
the gauri's power

10:11.120 --> 10:15.440
must be enlightened within us and they

10:14.160 --> 10:18.000
must express and they are

10:15.440 --> 10:20.399
tremendous i cannot describe them in one

10:18.000 --> 10:20.399
lecture

10:20.959 --> 10:27.600
think of the primordial kundalini

10:24.959 --> 10:28.240
she acts in the mother earth she acts in

10:27.600 --> 10:31.360
the

10:28.240 --> 10:35.279
universe she acts in the

10:31.360 --> 10:39.040
animals she acts in the matter

10:35.279 --> 10:41.760
she acts in the human beings and now she

10:39.040 --> 10:41.760
acts in you

10:44.720 --> 10:50.800
she is the one who decides

10:48.320 --> 10:52.079
the face and the figure that you are

10:50.800 --> 10:54.800
going to have

10:52.079 --> 10:55.920
she is the one who decides what child

10:54.800 --> 10:58.640
you should have

10:55.920 --> 11:02.240
she is the one who gives you a

10:58.640 --> 11:04.880
particular type of a child that you need

11:02.240 --> 11:07.200
she is the one who has got you all these

11:04.880 --> 11:09.360
beautiful children

11:07.200 --> 11:12.959
she is the one who has given you these

11:09.360 --> 11:16.480
sparkling faces and sparkling eyes

11:12.959 --> 11:18.880
all this she has done for you but what

11:16.480 --> 11:21.839
about the power that you have

11:18.880 --> 11:24.160
within yourself how much have you

11:21.839 --> 11:27.200
manifested that

11:24.160 --> 11:30.720
so try to understand that

11:27.200 --> 11:34.320
it is you who has to grow it is you

11:30.720 --> 11:36.079
who has to manifest these powers

11:34.320 --> 11:40.240
manifestation of the power

11:36.079 --> 11:40.240
i don't know how far you have understood

11:40.560 --> 11:46.800
when a person who has gauri's power

11:43.920 --> 11:47.920
as soon as he enters a hall or any place

11:46.800 --> 11:57.839
everybody's kundalini

11:47.920 --> 11:57.839
rises just to salute

12:00.480 --> 12:07.120
when you have gauri's power then you

12:03.839 --> 12:11.920
stand out because you have that

12:07.120 --> 12:15.279
innocent lustless greedless

12:11.920 --> 12:16.480
beautiful sparkling eyes and wherever

12:15.279 --> 12:19.360
you turn your eyes

12:16.480 --> 12:22.480
even one glance would raise the

12:19.360 --> 12:22.480
kundalini immediately

12:23.760 --> 12:27.519
people who suffer from cancer suffer

12:25.760 --> 12:30.000
from this disease that is it

12:27.519 --> 12:30.880
all can be cured in no time if you have

12:30.000 --> 12:38.320
developed only

12:30.880 --> 12:42.000
one power of gauri

12:38.320 --> 12:44.959
all your problems can be solved

12:42.000 --> 12:45.519
negativity will go away and you'll

12:44.959 --> 12:49.360
become

12:45.519 --> 12:49.360
like a lotus

12:50.839 --> 12:55.120
beautiful fragrant

12:57.079 --> 13:00.959
overpowering all kinds of negativity

12:59.760 --> 13:05.040
here it is

13:00.959 --> 13:08.800
that fellow just touched me

13:05.040 --> 13:08.800
and now i have become egoistical

13:09.279 --> 13:13.760
if there is one fellow who is egoistical

13:11.920 --> 13:15.360
he just talks to another person the

13:13.760 --> 13:17.680
person goes egoistical

13:15.360 --> 13:19.519
i mean this is not the way to be

13:17.680 --> 13:20.160
sensitive you have to be sensitive to

13:19.519 --> 13:23.680
god

13:20.160 --> 13:27.040
and not to bad things but we

13:23.680 --> 13:31.279
are more akin more

13:27.040 --> 13:31.279
vulnerable to bad than to good

13:32.399 --> 13:37.839
so the power the power of assimilation

13:36.639 --> 13:42.880
of good
