00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.640
here you are

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.520
in such a great position that you have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.520
got realization

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.160
that only thing you have to accept

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.160
the beauty of this

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.000
great yoga that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.520
you just enlighten

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.200
your own powers which are

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.440
on these seven chakras now let us see

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.520
the first chakra belongs to the power

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.840
of gauri the power of the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.840
mother of shri ganesha

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.960
gauri's power tremendous there aren't

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.280
they

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.960
because of her power you have got your

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.840
realization

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.840
now what have we done

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.720
to enshrine that power within ourselves

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.479
today's if it is the first day of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.400
navratri

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.400
let us see what have we done

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.040
have we been able to develop our

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.759
innocence

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:45.280
within ourselves

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.720
when people talk they are so sharp

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.759
how can you be sharp if you are innocent

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.759
they are so bumptious

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.320
how can you be that if you are innocent

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:02.479
people play games how can you do that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.640
if you are innocent harm each other

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.920
how can it be if you are innocent

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.120
so first of all you have to see yourself

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.680
that the power of innocence if it has to

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520
live

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.760
all the rest of the nonsense has to go

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.760
away

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.560
if you want to have the innocence all

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
that is anti-innocence has to be dropped

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.800
off

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.440
i can understand about people who are

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.560
ignorant

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.040
who have ignorance then in ignorance of

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.519
course

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.040
how will they talk of innocence but you

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.680
are not ignorant people

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.840
you are knowledgeable you've got your

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.280
enlightenment

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.440
and the power of innocence is so great

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.920
it makes you absolutely fearless not

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.160
bombshell but fearless

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.360
and the greatest thing of innocence is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.360
that you are respectful

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.920
the sense of respect

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.560
if it is not developed within you if you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.200
cannot

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.040
develop the sense of respect for other

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.239
sahaja yogis

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.519
for other people for the ashrams for the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.040
discipline

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.040
and your own self-respect

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.560
then it is of no use

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.680
even talking of sahaja yoga because

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.480
that's the very

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.480
beginning of it

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.959
first you do not respect all right you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.720
are bumped us all right

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.720
you are in a big

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.920
fool's paradise as they call it riding a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.319
fast horse

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.440
all that is there is all right is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.560
forgiven

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.239
but once you have seen the light you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.560
must try to

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.840
get rid of all the snakes that you have

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.840
been holding on

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.760
is a simple thing

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.920
in your childlike nature only

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.239
you can receive the blessings of gauri

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.199
otherwise you cannot

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.479
you have to be really childlike

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.079
otherwise

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.400
it is absolutely useless no use telling

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.320
you

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.520
anything because you think you are too

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.199
clever

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.360
to such a person who thinks he's too

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.720
clever was this of talking to such a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.199
person because he already knows

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.199
everything

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.320
so the first power when you develop you

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.520
must learn to sit on the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.520
mother earth first of all

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.919
you must respect the mother earth

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.759
because the first chakra is made out of

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.960
the mother earth

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.680
try to be more settle down with yourself

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.680
on mother earth

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.960
under respect see the trees

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.680
when they get their flowers

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.960
they are not so respectful but when they

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.479
are leading by

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.199
the fruits they bow down

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.199
to mother earth

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.479
in the same way when you have got the

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:25.840
fruits

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:25.840
of sahaja yoga you all must bow down

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:35.360
and innocence has a special capacity

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.360
to make a person extremely peaceful

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.080
extremely peaceful all the

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:47.840
anger temper violence

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.560
if a person doesn't have innocence

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.560
it cannot

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:56.400
come in you because the person who is

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.600
not innocent

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.240
is either sly or

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.240
aggressive

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.840
he cannot have peace within his heart

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.440
but an innocent person is not bothered

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.479
innocently he lives

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.520
enjoys everything in complete

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.520
peace and harmony

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:26.080
but this violence comes

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:28.319
when a person becomes clever

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.600
he thinks i am so clever the another one

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:34.000
is so stupid

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.840
i have a right to shout at that person

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.600
and the one who is not innocent is

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.520
never wise he may be to look at look

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:48.400
sharp but he's not wise

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.800
wisdom comes only with innocence and how

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.080
much

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.080
wisdom have you gathered

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.000
that is what one has to say when

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:05.199
your power

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.319
of innocence increases wisdom

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.479
is apparent people say that fellow is

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.800
very wise

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.560
for example if somebody is crying about

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.360
his wife

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.080
a wise person we could say obama just

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.120
look at this

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.880
still busy with his wife another one is

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.360
crying about his house or something he

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.759
say oh

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.080
look at this one still busy with the

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.080
house

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.919
there is no end to it

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.479
i have known people who get

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.160
so swollen up

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:47.280
that they think they must give a big

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.280
lecture for one hour

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.240
on sahaja yoga unless and until they

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:54.560
have given one hour lecture

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.759
they do not think their ego has

00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.520
manifested itself fully

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:02.080
but a wise person he doesn't have to

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.160
talk

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.160
or speak or do anything

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:14.879
he impresses his silence

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:17.680
his wisdom on others much more easily

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:18.879
and that is what we have to see have we

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.599
been able

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:23.199
to discipline ourselves because our

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:25.919
growth is very

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:26.400
much in the beginning of it you have to

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:29.120
grow

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.120
quite a lot

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:36.159
and people don't understand this point

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:39.519
in an atmosphere of egoistical

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:42.560
temperament that you have to grow

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:45.919
you have not yet grown

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.919
you have to grow a lot

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:55.519
and when you grow you find this wisdom

00:08:51.040 --> 00:09:00.560
really fragrant with compassion

00:08:55.519 --> 00:09:00.560
your wisdom is fragrant with compassion

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:05.279
such beautiful compassion

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.760
can emit through your being

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.880
that anybody who comes in contact with

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.399
you

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.399
will feel your auspiciousness

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:25.200
but again

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.640
you must give due respect to your

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.600
self-realization

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:32.640
and to yourself that is the first thing

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.839
you have to do is to meditate

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.200
we are not drinking we do not have

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:40.320
hangovers

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.320
we don't sleep late

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.800
so why shouldn't we decide today that

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.560
every morning i'll get up and do my

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.200
meditation

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.720
and while meditating i must concentrate

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.720
on myself and not on others

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.959
and see for myself what is catching

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.680
where am i catching what chakra i am

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:03.279
coaching

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.800
whatever to do so on this day of

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:08.000
navratri

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.120
today as the first day

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.160
the gauri's power

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.440
must be enlightened within us and they

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.000
must express and they are

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.399
tremendous i cannot describe them in one

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.399
lecture

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:27.600
think of the primordial kundalini

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.240
she acts in the mother earth she acts in

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.360
the

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:35.279
universe she acts in the

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:39.040
animals she acts in the matter

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:41.760
she acts in the human beings and now she

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.760
acts in you

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.800
she is the one who decides

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.079
the face and the figure that you are

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.800
going to have

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:55.920
she is the one who decides what child

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.640
you should have

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.240
she is the one who gives you a

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.880
particular type of a child that you need

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.200
she is the one who has got you all these

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.360
beautiful children

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.959
she is the one who has given you these

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:16.480
sparkling faces and sparkling eyes

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:18.880
all this she has done for you but what

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.839

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.800
when a person who has gauri's power

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.920
as soon as he enters a hall or any place

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:57.839
everybody's kundalini

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:57.839

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:11.920
stand out because you have that

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:15.279

you turn your eyes

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.480
even one glance would raise the

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.480
kundalini immediately

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.519
people who suffer from cancer suffer

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.000
from this disease that is it

00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:30.880
all can be cured in no time if you have

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.320
developed only

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:42.000
one power of gauri

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.959

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.519
negativity will go away and you'll

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:49.360
become

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:49.360
like a lotus

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:55.120
beautiful fragrant

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:00.959
overpowering all kinds of negativity

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.040
here it is

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:08.800
that fellow just touched me

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.800
and now i have become egoistical

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:13.760
if there is one fellow who is egoistical

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.360
he just talks to another person the

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.680
person goes egoistical

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.519
i mean this is not the way to be

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.160
sensitive you have to be sensitive to

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:23.680
god

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:27.040
and not to bad things but we

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:31.279
are more akin more

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.279
vulnerable to bad than to good

00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:37.839
so the power the power of assimilation

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:42.880
of good

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:45.920
the power of emission of good

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:49.839

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.839
your complete reach

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.600
but all this should not become a praise

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.760
but should become a kind of a challenge

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.839
a kind

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.839
