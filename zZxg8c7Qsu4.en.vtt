00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.800
We are living in these modern times

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.785
which are very eventful

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.113
In last 50 or 60 years so many things have happened

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:35.326
and the churning should bring forth many truths before us

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.912
First we have to realize that man has separated from each other.

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:02.667
The relationships that existed once upon a time

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.549
are no more to be found today.

00:01:12.993 --> 00:01:20.553
And on the collective level we are waiting for a shock.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.939
God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall upon us.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:41.735
Loudly. God knows what sort of a disaster is going to fall.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.520
You can come here, better.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.500
And in these uncertain times only

00:01:59.949 --> 00:02:06.069
we have to realize that there must some way out.

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.479
The way we understand through our mental projections,

00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:31.653
the solution is not in the view.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:41.914
The solution that we think is the solution becomes a bondage, a system.

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:54.486
We try to break one system and build up another one

00:02:54.735 --> 00:02:58.415
and that's how we find ourselves

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.520
miserably caught up into these systems.

00:03:10.434 --> 00:03:17.034
So there has gone something wrong in our understanding of the problem.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:24.255
We have to little bit stand back

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.425
and see what mistake we must have committed.

00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:40.935
Once upon a time I came to Belgium on a ship,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.120
it was a very thriving shipping company.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.760
All that is showing us

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.240
that even our economic enterprises come to a halt.

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:23.966
Now other enterprises on the emotional basis

00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:35.248
or on the physical basis are giving us a feeling of confusion.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.560
Like today only a gentleman told me

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.476
that allopathic medicines are rather dangerous.

00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:59.647
So I said: "What is the solution you have for it?"

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.640
The reason the cement is very dangerous

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.840
because it retains lot of moisture.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.620
Then he said that the plastic is very dangerous ...

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:29.415
Ultimately it looked as if everything that we eat or live into

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.360
seems to be a dangerous spot.

00:05:41.525 --> 00:05:48.165
Now we should understand that the progress that we have made so far

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:51.282
is recoiling back upon ourselves.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.150
As if the progress was linear.

00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:10.561
I went to Houston 10 years back nobody would look at you.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.800
Nobody would look at you, there were so rich you see.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.080
Dynasty and all that, in Houston.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.842
And today they told me if anybody is willing to pay even the amount

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:34.200
we have to pay to the bank we are willing to sell our houses.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:50.060
This ask for oil, oil, oil, oil, now they don't want oil.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.880
Then in the science we discovered atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.880
all kinds of things.

00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:14.487
Then we have discovered our computers.

00:07:18.537 --> 00:07:22.297
And now we are worried that this computer will take over us.

00:07:29.114 --> 00:07:31.594
Everything is getting out of control.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.080
Where does the control lie?

00:07:40.567 --> 00:07:47.687
We talk of peace but how will you establish it?

00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.851
There is a control within us.

00:07:57.183 --> 00:08:00.183
We can control everything.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.420
First we have to be in control with ourselves.

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:14.026
First we have to know ourselves.

00:08:16.294 --> 00:08:21.494
And this feeling is very fashionable I should say.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.144
So many people are seeking the truth.

00:08:32.568 --> 00:08:37.328
Is a special quality of human beings who are seekers.

00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:48.205
And when they try to seek the idea goes to the market as usual.

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:53.402
It goes to the market, the idea.

00:08:56.043 --> 00:09:02.483
So the demand is there for somebody to guide you in your seeking.

00:09:05.687 --> 00:09:11.767
So you have people who provide a kind of a market.

00:09:15.647 --> 00:09:18.767
You get so many money spinning gurus,

00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:30.056
they talk to you about peace and happiness and emancipation.

00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:36.954
But you have to pay.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.920
Today somebody told me in the car that the people who

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.760
were telephoning asked how much do we have to pay.

00:09:55.146 --> 00:09:57.946
How much did you pay to Christ?

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.220
How much are you going to pay for the love of God?

00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:12.886
Is nothing human that you can purchase it.

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:19.295
The seekers if they realize one little point

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.040
that you cannot pay for it, for your evolution you cannot pay.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.360
That's one point, if you realize, half of the work is done.

00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:46.175
The second point is that it is your evolution

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.800
which is a living force, of living divine.

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:03.055
This living force which has made you from amoeba stage

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.960
to human being is going to make you something higher.

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:18.735
The living force that has created these beautiful flowers,

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.560
how much did these flowers pay to that?

00:11:27.448 --> 00:11:33.328
How much did they pay for it? Or how much did they exert for it?

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:40.485
So this evolution has to be spontaneous.

00:11:43.243 --> 00:11:46.483
Effortless.

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:50.844
And that is what is Sahaja.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.320
'Saha' means 'with' and 'ja' means 'born with you'.

00:12:03.411 --> 00:12:07.051
It is born with you, the power.

00:12:09.976 --> 00:12:13.376
And 'yoga' means 'the union with the divine'.

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:22.375
So every human being has a right to get to that state

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.160
where you become one with the divine.

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:39.246
We have heard about the all-pervading divine power.

00:12:43.975 --> 00:12:48.895
Right from Lao Tse to Christ to Buddha,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.760
all of them have talked about it.

00:12:57.301 --> 00:13:01.301
We did not know about the ether before.

00:13:06.497 --> 00:13:12.057
But we have heard about the Divine power, which is all-pervading.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:23.360
Once you are united with it, connected with it,

00:13:24.478 --> 00:13:32.478
then only you realize that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:45.175
But before that it's only talk, talk of religion,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.080
talk about all philosophies, it's just a talk.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.660
Without any experience of this Divine power,

00:14:00.975 --> 00:14:06.455
if we are going to believe into these talks and these dogmas

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.680
also these mental projections

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.760
we reach a state where we will say we don't believe in it.

00:14:25.603 --> 00:14:29.563
But this is not the way to know the Divine.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.720
In the Bible it is said that, "I will appear before you

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.720
like tongues of flames."

00:14:45.215 --> 00:14:48.975
In the Koran it is said that at the time of resurrection

00:14:49.023 --> 00:14:51.224
your hands will speak.

00:14:56.375 --> 00:15:01.615
You'll be surprised in the Koran, more chapters are dedicated

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.240
to the resurrection time than to the doomsday.

00:15:14.877 --> 00:15:21.037
They talk of the doomsday because that is how you frighten people.

00:15:25.418 --> 00:15:28.538
So this resurrection has to come first.

00:15:32.775 --> 00:15:37.775
Of course in all the Indian scriptures it is described

00:15:37.975 --> 00:15:44.215
that the only way to be in charge,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.960
to be in control yourself is through Self-realization.

00:15:57.406 --> 00:16:00.166
We do not know ourselves.

00:16:02.452 --> 00:16:07.212
People get cancer, they don't know they have cancer.

00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:16.308
People get mad, schizophrenic, they don't know they are mad.

00:16:21.135 --> 00:16:23.775
They don't know because they don't know their body,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.520
they don't know themselves.

00:16:30.138 --> 00:16:34.258
So to find out about ourselves we have to go inside.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.370
By going outside you cannot find out.

00:16:45.218 --> 00:16:47.338
How do you go inside?

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.970
You are all paying attention to me.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.240
But if I say please pay attention to yourself, you'll say, "How?".

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:05.364
You cannot take your attention inside.

00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:11.575
But you must know: the One who has made us

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.880
has put all that in image within us.

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:21.575
As the one who has made this instrument

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.040
has also left the connection there.

00:17:28.374 --> 00:17:31.974
So it has just to be plugged to the mains, that's all.

00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:37.195
Then it works, fantastically.

00:17:38.735 --> 00:17:42.095
Only we are not connected to mains, that's all.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.880
There's nothing else to be done.

00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:51.455
Once you are connected to the mains

00:17:51.855 --> 00:17:55.615
you'll get all your physical benefits,

00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.171
mental benefits, emotional benefits and spiritual benefits.

00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:12.650
I'll tell you about the spiritual.

00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:23.273
The spiritual benefit is that you get awakened to a new awareness.

00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:32.679
That on your central nervous system

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.981
you can feel the collective consciousness.

00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:51.873
That you can feel yourself and you can feel others within yourself.

00:18:57.696 --> 00:19:01.149
We have a force within us

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.024
which is the power of pure desire.

00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:11.880
Is not an impure desire.

00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:20.295
As you know in economics it is said that the power, the

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.255
satisfaction out of anything passes on from one to another.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.624
Like I want to buy a house then I want to buy a car

00:19:30.649 --> 00:19:32.719
then I want to buy that, I am never satisfied.

00:19:32.744 --> 00:19:35.514
So in general it is never satiable.

00:19:47.135 --> 00:19:54.055
But the pure desire within us is the desire to be one with the divine

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.239
so that we get into the eternal life.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.632
This desire has to be awakened.

00:20:13.176 --> 00:20:17.311
Once it is awakened in this human awareness

00:20:17.776 --> 00:20:21.696
you can feel on your central nervous system

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.251
these centers that are within your body

00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:38.490
which are subtle centers

00:20:40.356 --> 00:20:48.971
and when they are in any way in trouble you get all these problems.

00:20:55.144 --> 00:20:59.701
You can feel them on your fingertips.

00:21:02.975 --> 00:21:06.615
It's something in English, to feel something on your fingertips,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.269
means it is very easy.

00:21:13.895 --> 00:21:16.575
So you feel it on your fingertips,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.920
your own centers which are in trouble.

00:21:24.387 --> 00:21:29.600
And you feel the centers of another person.

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:38.895
Then if you know how to correct them

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.641
in a very simple way, maybe just rubbing.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.700
And which are these centers.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.010
You can correct everything that is physical, mental and emotional.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.920
That's how you come in control of yourself, you control yourself.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.920
We are at a stage which I can describe you with an analogy.

00:22:23.719 --> 00:22:31.107
Like in the car you have got a brake and an accelerator.

00:22:34.575 --> 00:22:38.695
In that way in our body also there are two nadis, two systems,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.393
two channels, left and right which act

00:22:42.468 --> 00:22:45.880
as the brake and the accelerator.

00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:56.506
In the autonomous nervous system the left and the right sympathetic.

00:23:00.894 --> 00:23:05.039
The central part is for our evolution.

00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:15.135
So once we learn how to use the accelerator and also the brake

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.465
we become a driver. That means we come in the center.

00:23:29.182 --> 00:23:33.815
That means we become evolved enough to be

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.160
automatically driving the car.

00:23:42.013 --> 00:23:46.187
But then there is the master sitting behind.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.760
Second stage you become the master.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.255
And you see the driver in you and

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:06.008
you see the brake and the accelerator.

00:24:11.286 --> 00:24:13.790
And you are in charge.

00:24:16.314 --> 00:24:24.314
In the same way today I hope today many of you will become in charge.

00:24:30.221 --> 00:24:35.519
It is a very simple spontaneous matter.

00:24:40.135 --> 00:24:42.975
Like I would say if you have to put lights,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.055
so beautiful, so many beautiful lights

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.480
you have to just put on one switch and then everything gets light.

00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:57.656
But behind that is a big history.

00:25:01.138 --> 00:25:04.496
Behind that there is a big organization.

00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:08.935
I need not explain all that to you.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.239
It's better to put on the light first.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.838
And it has worked.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.020
Yesterday it worked and I am sure today it must work.

00:25:33.246 --> 00:25:39.591
And this has to take place in a very smooth manner.

00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:49.495
There are people who have read some books on Kundalini, I believe.

00:25:54.374 --> 00:25:57.639
First when I read them I was shocked.

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:06.637
They are really absolutely against what is Kundalini awakening.

00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:14.919
They say it creates heat within you.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.853
They say that it burns you.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.400
Just the opposite.

00:26:25.095 --> 00:26:29.295
The reason is those who are trying the Kundalini awakening

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.080
are not authorized people.

00:26:38.661 --> 00:26:41.495
The one who doesn't understand about electricity

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.720
and puts his hands in the plug will get a shock.

00:26:50.726 --> 00:26:52.646
You have to be authorized.

00:26:54.954 --> 00:26:57.627
These people have no authority.

00:26:59.845 --> 00:27:02.001
It has to be a divine authority.

00:27:04.196 --> 00:27:06.135
A person who leads a life

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.780
of taking money from others in the name of God

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.915
is not a pure person at all.

00:27:17.883 --> 00:27:20.723
And moreover he has no self-respect.

00:27:23.495 --> 00:27:25.824
Or we can say he's a cheat.

00:27:28.257 --> 00:27:31.697
Such a horrid person, how can he raise the Kundalini?

00:27:35.454 --> 00:27:37.455
That's the purest form of energy,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.130
for that a person has to be a pure person.

00:27:46.263 --> 00:27:51.992
He talks to you about God and accumulates Rolls Royces.

00:27:54.385 --> 00:27:56.000
It's nonsense.

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:59.455
But what happens to people I don't understand.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.920
That they accept such situations and such people as their leaders,

00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:06.197
who are cheats, who are fake.

00:28:13.251 --> 00:28:18.571
It's very agonizing, to see the way people accept them.

00:28:23.055 --> 00:28:29.055
You'll be amazed in 1970 I openly denounced all of them one by one

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.691
and told them, "Be careful about these cheats."

00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:45.180
And I said it on a very big platform.

00:28:48.948 --> 00:28:52.295
People were very frightened and they said, "You shouldn't have said it,

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.299
they will prosecute you or they will kill you".

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:02.332
I said, "I'll have to see a person who can kill me".

00:29:05.713 --> 00:29:09.005
They have no courage because they are cheats.

00:29:12.295 --> 00:29:15.855
And they have cheated you people, you must understand this,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.095
that you cannot have a fake person to raise your Kundalini

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.242
or to give your rebirth.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.670
Buddha has said that ignorance is the biggest curse.

00:29:39.055 --> 00:29:42.935
Though we have progressed very much outside, like a tree

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.796
we are very ignorant about the roots, I think.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.815
And very beautiful people, seekers are lost

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:01.320
because they did not know about the roots.

00:30:07.092 --> 00:30:12.228
In India we know the category of gurus.

00:30:15.865 --> 00:30:20.295
Therein a guru who is called as Kuguru

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.360
means who is not a guru but a bad man.

00:30:29.581 --> 00:30:33.304
And they are all out in the market, in the West.

00:30:36.088 --> 00:30:38.393
Because they can't exist in India.

00:30:40.724 --> 00:30:47.335
If they try to spread their ideas in India a farmer will say,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.080
"All right, you get lost. We know all this nonsense."

00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:59.541
We have had this absurd in the sixth century sometimes

00:30:59.566 --> 00:31:03.620
but we have known all this, we have gone through all this.

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:15.439
Now, one has to realize that you have to become your own master.

00:31:20.103 --> 00:31:26.151
That is the sign of reality.

00:31:30.535 --> 00:31:34.615
So they say that there are gurus which are just called gurus

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.655
but they are agurus, mean they are not gurus but they do the job

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.535
like priests and all these people are not gurus but they do the job

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.510
you see they are paid for it.

00:31:49.273 --> 00:31:55.553
But the sat guru is the one that makes you meet the Divine.

00:31:59.453 --> 00:32:04.495
That's the thing. So now what happens if your Kundalini is awakened.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.826
What happens when you get your realization, what should happen?

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.255
When the disciples of Christ were blessed by Holy Ghost what happened?

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.080
they felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:32:28.831 --> 00:32:33.855
They started the language, speaking the language of centers, chakras.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.994
And people thought they're speaking some Latin or Greek.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:49.995
If you become divine person you don't speak human languages do you?

00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:56.971
Then you speak divine language.

00:32:59.831 --> 00:33:06.590
And the divine language is the language of the chakras, the centers.

00:33:13.634 --> 00:33:17.353
The people thought they were mad.

00:33:19.979 --> 00:33:24.620
I mean if you go in the madhouse everybody thinks you are mad, isn't it.

00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:31.729
No use talking to the blind people about the colors.

00:33:35.088 --> 00:33:39.972
But here now we are to prove of the existence of God.

00:33:43.784 --> 00:33:47.120
And existence of this divine power.

00:33:49.068 --> 00:33:52.545
Existence of the divine laws.

00:33:54.979 --> 00:33:56.890
On your fingertips.

00:33:59.284 --> 00:34:04.338
The time has come, the blossom time has come

00:34:04.363 --> 00:34:07.815
so thousands have to become the fruit.

00:34:14.935 --> 00:34:17.335
The other day another gentleman just raised

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.055
a question for nothing at all.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.640
That it is called as a serpent power.

00:34:20.665 --> 00:34:24.320
I mean I never called it, but somebody must have called it.

00:34:29.338 --> 00:34:34.080
Because I think in the West people are very allergic to the word serpent.

00:34:38.492 --> 00:34:46.092
But this energy is coiled into three and a half coils.

00:34:47.455 --> 00:34:51.855
And in some people you can even see the pulsation,

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.479
just like a heart on the triangular bone.

00:35:01.339 --> 00:35:06.195
When there is obstruction in the stomach on the solar plexus

00:35:10.317 --> 00:35:16.067
but it rises

00:35:18.036 --> 00:35:20.761
it pierces through your fontanel bone area.

00:35:23.346 --> 00:35:28.163
And you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

00:35:33.784 --> 00:35:39.219
It's an experience which is just the beginning.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.230
Then you have to feel your own centers on your fingertips.

00:35:49.438 --> 00:35:53.264
This is the actualization of baptism.

00:35:59.095 --> 00:36:02.615
It's not something artificial, that you put some water

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.666
on somebody's head and now you are baptized.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:14.434
And we accept it. We accept all these certificates we accept.

00:36:19.718 --> 00:36:26.633
William Blake writes, "A priest cursed me on my head",

00:36:36.729 --> 00:36:38.858
because he was a realized soul.

00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:44.575
We had so many realized souls but they could not

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.480
convince people about it.

00:36:51.168 --> 00:36:53.889
At the most they were called as mad people.

00:36:56.189 --> 00:36:58.349
Nobody tried to understand.

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:05.314
Doesn't matter. Now when we will know the truth,

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:09.200
that we are the Spirit, that we are in charge.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.080
Then you will see for yourself that

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.578
whatever all these great incarnations have said,

00:37:16.798 --> 00:37:20.745
all these prophets have said is the truth.

00:37:30.889 --> 00:37:34.516
We may say that is the knowledge of the roots.

00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:40.415
To know the knowledge of the roots we have to be

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.800
at a subtler situation.

00:37:47.651 --> 00:37:50.571
We have to become a subtler personality.

00:37:53.055 --> 00:37:56.495
And when we become that subtler personality

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.483
we know that we are collectively conscious.

00:38:08.607 --> 00:38:12.092
Truth must be experienced, one thing.

00:38:16.439 --> 00:38:19.879
And everybody must say that that is so.

00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:26.214
Like say you can say that I am wearing a red shawl all right.

00:38:30.317 --> 00:38:33.975
Everybody sees it's a red shawl.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.228
It is not that for some people it is green.

00:38:40.995 --> 00:38:44.560
In the same way truth should be universal.

00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:53.176
And truth should be expressed on our central nervous system.

00:38:57.913 --> 00:39:02.985
Like for a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:09.720
Dog. For a dog to go through a dirty lane is no problem.

00:39:14.742 --> 00:39:17.742
He cannot smell the filth.

00:39:21.077 --> 00:39:23.863
But he can feel a thief.

00:39:26.399 --> 00:39:31.959
But for a human being it is difficult to go through a dirty lane.

00:39:36.919 --> 00:39:39.504
But he can trust a thief.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.320
So the central nervous system is the one that tells you the truth.

00:39:50.215 --> 00:39:54.135
Our central nervous system as it is at the human level

00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:04.168
has to be enlightened by the Spirit.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:12.725
Lots of confusions there are already, I find, about the Spirit.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.360
Language problem.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.219
Like the Spirit could be dead body which is haunting

00:40:28.898 --> 00:40:33.480
or could be the Spirit, the Atma the reflection of God almighty.

00:40:35.596 --> 00:40:37.213
Or could be alcohol.

00:40:38.497 --> 00:40:40.775
Now which one I am talking about.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.317
It's the Spirit in your heart.

00:40:46.107 --> 00:40:50.827
Same about eternal life, there's a confusion I think.

00:40:55.135 --> 00:41:00.375
Some people think that if you die and become a ghost or a vampire,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.360
you have an eternal life.

00:41:06.684 --> 00:41:08.335
It is not.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:14.911
Eternal life is a life where you become the Spirit which is eternal.

00:41:19.775 --> 00:41:25.455
I must confess in this short time is not easy to explain everything

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.392
about this ocean of knowledge.

00:41:36.524 --> 00:41:39.135
I must have given thousands of lectures before

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:45.473
so I would apologize for not explaining everything

00:41:50.613 --> 00:41:53.687
but need not explain at all

00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:00.440
As I said that you have to just switch the button on and you get it.

00:42:03.061 --> 00:42:06.654
So why not have it.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.840
May God bless you.
