1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,700
Today we have decided to have the puja of
Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:21,619
We have many a times done this puja and have
understood the essence of Shri Krishna’s

3
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,599
advent, which was six thousand years back.

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:44,600
And now, what His manifestation was, what
He wanted to be accomplished has to be done

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,910
in this Kali Yuga.

6
00:00:48,910 --> 00:01:00,590
As it is, this Kali Yuga is going into a new
realm of Satya Yuga, but in between there

7
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:13,279
is Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya,
or we can say the all-pervading Power of God’s

8
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:16,400
love, is going to act.

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:27,470
At this time, what is going to happen with
Shri Krishna’s powers – this is what we

10
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,900
have to see.

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,919
Shri Krishna, as I told you, was the incarnation
also of diplomacy.

12
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:44,979
So He plays around quite a lot, and ultimately
He brings forth the untruth and the falsehood;

13
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,029
but in doing that He judges people.

14
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:55,379
So it’s very important that Shri Krishna’s
powers of His diplomacy were to be manifesting

15
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:00,909
at this time, when it is the Last Judgment.

16
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:14,760
So now whatever we have done wrong before,
whatever karmas which have been done in ignorance

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,490
maybe, or maybe deliberately, all of them
will be paid back.

18
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:30,710
Those punyas which you have done in previous
lives, this life, will be also rewarded.

19
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:39,370
This is all done through Shri Krishna’s
principles of collectivity, where He collectively

20
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,640
sees the situation.

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:54,850
For example, as I told you last time also
that Columbus luckily went to America; luckily,

22
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:59,670
so we were saved, otherwise we would not have
been here.

23
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:09,110
And then these Spanish people, bullfighters,
they went and started fighting the poor, unarmed

24
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,480
people who were just very simple owners of
that land.

25
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,370
But they went and occupied those lands, and
killed every one of them.

26
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,780
So in America you can’t find anyone, no
doubt, but even in South America you have

27
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:34,190
to go to Colombia or to Bolivia, to great
heights, to see some aboriginals there; otherwise

28
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,740
most of them are finished.

29
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,860
So now in Krita Yuga all these diseases have
started cropping up.

30
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,930
But the best part is the drug addiction.

31
00:03:50,930 --> 00:04:00,500
These drugs are made, for your information,
in Bolivia and in Colombia.

32
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:08,660
You drove them down there, so now you have
the drugs and very nicely you are very welcoming

33
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,390
them.

34
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:21,810
People went in Nicaragua to help them and
brought back all these horrible drugs to Washington;

35
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,530
and in every elite society they are just discussing
which is the best drug, where is the sale

36
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,430
on and where should they buy the drugs.

37
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,790
So the all of America is now worried how much
drug they can import, and kill themselves

38
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,360
and destroy themselves.

39
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,520
So this destruction has started from inside.

40
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:53,370
Then in addition to that, when I went there
first I told them not to indulge into these

41
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:09,340
Freudian practices but keep to morality, otherwise
you’ll have problems.

42
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:21,590
So they had first AIDS, secondly now yuppie’s
disease, and all kinds of secret diseases

43
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,170
they have.

44
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,409
Among ten people there would be at least one
person who is suffering from that, and among

45
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:34,670
twenty people there’ll be at least one person
who must be suffering from schizophrenia.

46
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:43,750
Because they made every person, every other
country nervous, so now they are getting schizophrenia.

47
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,000
Like this we can see even in England.

48
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:01,010
Now in England they came to India as traders,
ordinary traders, and plundered us completely,

49
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:07,170
no doubt, ruled us for three hundred years
– as I say, it’s gracious hospitality

50
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:14,870
they had – and then they left us in three
pieces.

51
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,610
And now in their own country there are problems,
all kinds.

52
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:27,780
First of all nobody wants to call themselves
as English; they all call themselves Welsh

53
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,480
or Scots, or specially the Irish.

54
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,140
And there is always a bomb scare in London,
every time, and for our first program also

55
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,909
there was a bomb scare.

56
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:46,080
So you can imagine these English who tried
to divide us are automatically divided among

57
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,530
themselves, and now fighting each other.

58
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:54,960
But there are other problems also like AIDS
and immoral life, everything like that.

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,290
Same with the French.

60
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,590
French tried to sell their wine all over,
and bring their horrible bathroom culture

61
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,790
everywhere.

62
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,400
Now they are suffering from it.

63
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,189
For example, most of the time they’re drunk
and they have lost all moorings, I mean, they

64
00:07:14,189 --> 00:07:16,580
have no sense left in their heads.

65
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,540
Like a housewife could be a prostitute – allowed
by law.

66
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,390
All such things are happening.

67
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,260
Now they are paying, and the worst that they
are paying, all these countries who think

68
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,800
no end of themselves, are recession.

69
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,900
This is also Shri Krishna’s power, because
He’s Kubera.

70
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,550
He’s the one who is the power of wealth.

71
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,780
He gave lot of wealth to all these countries,
and now they don’t know what to do with

72
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
themselves.

73
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,469
We can see in these fifty years how many things
have happened, but specially these twenty

74
00:07:57,469 --> 00:07:59,850
years have been really remarkable.

75
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:10,130
All over the world you can find out there
has been some sort of a complete change, or

76
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,400
an exposure.

77
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:22,840
Even in Italy you see every day this Vatican
is here exposed, or some mafia connections

78
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,172
are there, or this what you call, people from
the government are exposed.

79
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:37,040
I am doing nothing, I’m just sitting here,
but it is working out that way.

80
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,140
Since I have been here I don’t know how
many people have gone to jail, God knows.

81
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,040
(I don’t know if she’s not brought My
throat pastilles.

82
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:53,270
I had a bath early in the morning, so a little
bit … This is, Shri Krishna is trying to

83
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,650
fill Me up!)

84
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:15,160
We Indians are also suffering,because our
past deeds – like we had a caste system.

85
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,540
So now the caste system has become the greatest
headache for us in India, that’s the greatest

86
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,640
cancer for us.

87
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:31,690
Like that, everywhere these twenty years or
twenty-one years have been … ( … I don’t

88
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,480
know, because morning.

89
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:53,170
Also reaction on Me … ) So like that in
every country, you’ll see gradually, every

90
00:09:53,170 --> 00:10:00,320
country will have to face for what it has
done.

91
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:11,250
Also Shri Krishna’s own style was that He
can never believed in caste system.

92
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:20,930
He Himself was born in a caste which is a,
what you call is a milkman’s caste, and

93
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:28,120
then He became a king, of course; but to begin
with, and He lived like an ordinary person.

94
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,710
He used to take the cows outside, look after
them and bring them home.

95
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:44,320
Now if you see His life you’ll find He is
absolutely very human, the way He used to

96
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,850
tease His mother, tease other ladies.

97
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:53,340
All this is extremely human and childlike,
and extremely sweet.

98
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,359
But behind that also there was a great significance.

99
00:10:57,359 --> 00:11:05,560
For example, Shri Radha – as you know, She
was Mahalakshmi – and as Mahalakshmi She

100
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,470
used to put Her feet, take bath in the river
Yamuna, and the ladies would take water from

101
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,540
the same river, carry on their head the pitchers.

102
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,680
Now Shri Krishna wanted to raise their kundalini,
so He used to hit them from the back so that

103
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:30,440
the water falls on their back, and that vibrated
water would raise their kundalini.

104
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,630
This was His childish trick, but it had a
meaning.

105
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:40,299
Another one, when we see Him in ras – “ra”
means energy.

106
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:46,109
Radha: “ra” is “energy,” “dha”
means “the one who sustains it” – so

107
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:49,990
it is Radhaji who had the energy.

108
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:57,490
“Sa” means “with,” so when they played
ras, was nothing but to play with the energy.

109
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,970
And that’s how He wanted to have a collective
awakening of people, of gopa and gopis, and

110
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,390
He did it.

111
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,700
But then He had to leave and fight this Kamsa.

112
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:15,330
In His own lifetime, as a child or grown-up,
He punished all kinds of devils and women

113
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,770
devils who were like Putna, and all that.

114
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:25,010
He did it, and in this Kali Yuga also He’s
active.

115
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:31,940
We have seen how gradually He has finished
so many false gurus, one by one; somebody

116
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,039
who called himself Shri Krishna, somebody
who called himself as God, something else,

117
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,039
something else.

118
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,979
He finished them all, exposed them nicely,
and now we have very few people in the arena

119
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:46,900
left for us to fight.

120
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,580
They themselves are trembling and they are
quite frightened of us, because we are standing

121
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,140
on truth.

122
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:03,720
So now, when we have to think about Shri Krishna
who is residing in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

123
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:10,640
Many people have this problem of left Vishuddhi.

124
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:18,950
That is because we are more sort of very social
people.

125
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:25,320
Now in the Western society, the social system
is so rigid that anybody can collapse with

126
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,940
that, or used to be; now better because of
the, maybe the revolt, anti-culture.

127
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:38,669
But otherwise if you could put one spoon from
here to there, then you are finished.

128
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:44,850
If you start your food with, say, not with
the fish knife but with an ordinary knife,

129
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,260
then you’re finished, you are no good.

130
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:55,280
And these French have made even much worse
by using a big science out of alcohol.

131
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:02,620
For this alcohol this is the glass, for that
alcohol that is the glass, and all that.

132
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,590
So the whole collective was made so rigid.

133
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,070
It’s much more rigid than in India.

134
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:14,820
I used to think Indian collective is quite
rigid because of certain conditionings we

135
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:26,330
have, but after coming to the West I was surprised
that it is such a conditioning in the heads

136
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:33,039
of the people, that some of the conditionings
you cannot remove – say from Catholic Church,

137
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,740
you might say, or from wherever it is.

138
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:44,241
But when it comes from somebody like Freud
who was absolutely a devil, they just give

139
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:48,030
up all these conditionings and take to that.

140
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:55,020
I cannot understand any country where there
is Catholic Church so predominant, they are

141
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,210
following Freud.

142
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:05,900
So this collective rigidity, which was then
because maybe Shri Rama was a very formal

143
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:13,109
person, because of Him maybe the collective
rigidity might have been in India.

144
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:19,410
But in the West it is all mental, it’s absolutely
mental.

145
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:25,160
If you make this kind of hair then you are
all right, if you put oil then you are absolutely

146
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:32,780
lunatic: all kinds of funny ideas were given,
and people started doing like this.

147
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,210
If you don’t put oil at all you’ll become
bald.

148
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,430
If you become bald, then they will have a
business of their wigs.

149
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:44,320
So the whole thing was money-oriented, and
everything was made so fixed that you had

150
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,370
to do it so that they could sell their things.

151
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:52,530
England was, as you know, is tailcoat: you
have to wear a tailcoat if you have to see

152
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,530
the Queen.

153
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:59,120
I don’t know why you have to wear a tailcoat
to see the Queen, but it’s compulsory, and

154
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,030
if you don’t wear then you are not allowed.

155
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,871
So they have to borrow these tailcoats and
all that from one shop, which can be tight,

156
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:13,650
which can be loose, and everybody looks like
Charlie Chaplin to Me!

157
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,080
They can’t walk straight.

158
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:29,820
So this kind of stupid rigidity that came
into the West has really made them very nervous.

159
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,280
People are so nervous here.

160
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:40,359
If you tell some lady that “I am going to
come and have food with you,” she will collapse.

161
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:46,909
God knows what she thinks, I mean, it is caring
for the public opinion, or her own conditioning.

162
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:53,380
But in an Indian, a housewife, if you tell
her you are going to come, she’ll be the

163
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,810
happiest person.

164
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,440
She’ll be very happy that you are coming
to her house for dinner.

165
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,940
But here even if you say, “I would like
to come and see you in the evening,” they’ll

166
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,070
say, “All right, come in the pub.”

167
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:13,520
Because they’re so nervous, they’re not
sure of themself; and this has come, I think,

168
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,060
perhaps from these norms that there have been
created in the West.

169
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:26,020
In India also we had lots of these ritualism
that came up very serious.

170
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:34,590
Like we had people, Jainis who’d pick up
their hair with their hands.

171
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:46,110
They are not supposed to use any knives or
any scissors or any barbers, so they were

172
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,180
supposed to pick up their hair on their own.

173
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,590
So from their beard, from their this thing,
they would pick up all the time.

174
00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:00,970
That went to such a horrible conditioning
that they would say that if you, even if you

175
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,939
breathe then you can, you might consume some
animals.

176
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:11,000
So they would put some sort of a cloth before
their mouth, and all kinds of nonsense they

177
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,410
did.

178
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,110
At that time Shri Krishna came in.

179
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:24,040
His own cousin was a tirthankara, you’ll
be surprised, Neminath.

180
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:32,970
He became a tirthankara, and that made Shri
Krishna think about it, that this kind of

181
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,240
stupid ritualism that we have.

182
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,830
Like in the morning women will get up, in
their sleep they will go, put some water for

183
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,000
tulsi, do this thing, that thing, throw water
here and there.

184
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,060
And also the untouchables and touchables;
and you can’t take water from this, you

185
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:58,730
can’t eat this, you can’t move like that
– all kinds of restrictions, timing, everything.

186
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,730
This time is not good, that time is not good,
this you should not do, that you should not

187
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:13,990
do, to such an extent that the whole movement
of our country was round these rituals.

188
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,050
I had nephews who used to come to Bombay for
their work.

189
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,210
Every time they went to Lucknow, they would
come with shaven heads.

190
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,040
I said, “What’s the matter?”

191
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,670
He said, “There are many people in our family
who are old, and when they die we have to

192
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,670
shave our heads.”

193
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,730
So every time they went there somebody died,
so they came with shaven heads.

194
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,050
Like that such horrible rituals existed, and
even now in the South India there is a lot

195
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:43,910
of rituals are there, terrible rituals, and
they cannot get out of it, they’re frightened.

196
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:51,390
If they get out of it then they might be sinners,
or they will go to hell.

197
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:59,600
So the Indian conditioning was, as far as
these rigidities were concerned for religion,

198
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,780
to be on the right side in such a way that
we should not be caught up without doing this.

199
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:12,740
So early in the morning they’ll get up and
do the rituals, just without even thinking

200
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,340
about what they’re doing.

201
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,690
But in the West the lifestyle is nothing but
rigidity, the whole lifestyle is; there’s

202
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,310
no freedom anywhere.

203
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:31,130
And all that then was rewarded by these hippies
and other people, and all of them, and they

204
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,310
fought it, and that thing went to another
extremes.

205
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,350
So from one extreme to another extreme they
went.

206
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:46,710
Now, how Shri Krishna’s advent changed it.

207
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:57,740
When Shri Krishna came on this Earth, He said
this is all a leela, it is just a play.

208
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,730
Because you are involved into it, you cannot
see the play.

209
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:10,569
But if you ascend – if you are in the water
you are afraid of the water, but if you get

210
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:17,810
into the boat you can see the water, and if
you know how to swim you can even save the

211
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,480
people who are in the water.

212
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:29,370
So He says that if you develop a witness state,
sakshi swarupata, if you develop that state

213
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,870
then you see the whole thing as a drama.

214
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,900
Nothing affects you.

215
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:41,590
Nothing matters, you don’t worry about anything,
you see the problem above; you are, and you

216
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:45,510
see the problem, and because you are out of
it, you can solve the problem.

217
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:54,860
This was His great advent, I would say, that
has taught the first step towards the ascent,

218
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,079
is that you have to become a sakshi.

219
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,579
You have to become the witness.

220
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:05,620
Now let’s see in Sahaja Yoga.

221
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:12,270
In Sahaja Yoga there are different types of
people come from different areas, from different

222
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,079
cultures, because the door is open to everyone.

223
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:26,350
Now if an Indian comes in, he will be all
the time watchful about others, and will say

224
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,340
that “Mother, this man is not doing this,
this man is not doing that.

225
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,530
He should have done footsoaking.”

226
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:40,809
He’ll find faults with others, all the time
saying that this man is not doing like this,

227
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,550
and you know.

228
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,210
But in the West they start finding faults
with themselves.

229
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:53,660
And I receive letters, ten to twelve pages
sometimes, confessing what wrong they have

230
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
done.

231
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,740
Who is interested to know, what wrongs you
have done?

232
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:09,650
I mean, if a lotus is born, nobody wants to
know how many filthy things are inside the

233
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,650
pond.

234
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:13,860
You are now a lotus.

235
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,990
But it’s so common that they think we must
confess, we must tell Mother what wrong we

236
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,990
have done.

237
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,380
Every moment you are changing, so what is
there to confess?

238
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:33,530
And the life is so formal, as I told you,
that people suffer from guilt for anything.

239
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:41,429
Apart from the influence of this Catholic
Church has conditioned you so much that even

240
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:46,360
if you are not a Catholic, you’re a Protestant,
still you have guilt, and as a guilt you develop

241
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,900
this left Vishuddhi.

242
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:56,420
So then this left Vishuddhi is Vishnumaya
– means what?

243
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:03,890
Once you have this left Vishuddhi you develop
all the problems of the Vishnumaya, and one

244
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,150
of them is the heart.

245
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:15,770
Because Vishnumaya is an active thing, She
is like electricity; and if you have Vishnumaya

246
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,130
problem, then you become lethargic.

247
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,770
“Oh, I’m so guilty.”

248
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,770
You become depressed.

249
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,740
That Vishnumaya Principle disappears from
you.

250
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:35,790
She’s the one who’s quick, fast, and She
gives the light, and announces to the whole

251
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,720
world what Shri Krishna is.

252
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:45,320
While what happens with such people, Sahaja
yogis who come in, who feel guilty, they say,

253
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,250
“Mother, You know, we thought that if we
do this then our ego will come up.

254
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:58,640
If we do any work outside and work in some
fields or in some villages, then our ego will

255
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
come up.

256
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,760
So we don’t want to do it.”

257
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,140
This is absurd.

258
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,850
It’s like you give light to some light,
and the light says that “I don’t want

259
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:17,449
to give the light, because maybe this light
might develop an ego.”

260
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,449
It is absurd.

261
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:24,250
But such absurd things Sahaja yogis tell Me.

262
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:30,829
For them one has to understand, to get out
of this left Vishuddhi is to become absolutely

263
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:37,710
dynamic in Sahaja Yoga, go all out into Sahaja
Yoga.

264
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,939
Otherwise they can’t get rid of their left
Vishuddhis.

265
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:51,570
Left Vishuddhi is a thing that’s a very
depressive action on the whole being, and

266
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:58,890
a person who has left Vishuddhi is always
a very slow person to do anything for Sahaja

267
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,890
Yoga.

268
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,460
You have not been given light to hide it.

269
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,790
Christ has said that you don’t put light
under the table.

270
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:15,660
So you have been given light to work it out,
to be dynamic, to think what to do, how to

271
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,780
arrange, how to organize.

272
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,210
But if you are guilty, then you will all the
time say, “Oh Mother, it’s very difficult,

273
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:29,390
You know, this . . .” Always you’ll find
the other side of the whole joke, just to

274
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,390
avoid.

275
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,740
Now for a Sahaja yogi is to witness himself,
first of all.

276
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,090
That is the introspection.

277
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,260
He should see for himself, “Where was I,
and I have come here.”

278
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,210
Don’t indulge too much in the past, but
see the distance you have crossed in such

279
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,620
a short time.

280
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,470
Now you have come into the Kingdom of God,
you have all the powers.

281
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,970
I don’t tell lies – it’s a fact.

282
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:01,949
I’ll give you an example, if Wolfgang allows
Me to say that.

283
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:13,189
Wolfgang was with Me when we were traveling
from Prague to Vienna and the plane, you see,

284
00:27:13,189 --> 00:27:16,699
he told Me that the plane is at ten-thirty,
but it was at nine-thirty; it was a mistake.

285
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:21,170
It’s all right, there can be mistake, of
course, that also is Shri Krishna’s style.

286
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,069
You can always do mistakes, doesn’t matter.

287
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:31,870
So we reached – I mean, why all these things
happen, see, to create an event, a ghatna.

288
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:37,660
So he was very upset about it that he told
Me a wrong time, and I reached there about

289
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,710
fifteen minutes late.

290
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,520
And there was a ground hostess, horrible,
she started shouting at Me, saying all kinds,

291
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,850
“It’s not fair, You don’t know,” this,
that and everything.

292
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:53,170
I just didn’t bother about it because I
knew that it was out of mistake we’ve done

293
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,170
it.

294
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,000
And they could have taken away their plane
instead of shouting, but they kept the plane

295
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,970
and shouted at Me, because she wanted to shout,
you see.

296
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:15,290
Then the plane was filled in with people and
it would not leave, so I asked the engineers.

297
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,309
They said, “It has been like this for the
half-an-hour.

298
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:19,120
We are trying to correct it.

299
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,380
It’s like this.”

300
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,070
So it’s all right.

301
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:29,750
He said that “We’ll have to wait till
we put it right.”

302
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:36,230
But because she shouted at Me, Wolfgang was
full of tears, you see; just look at this

303
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,929
German having so many tears in his eyes!

304
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,880
Then Alga was telling him that “It’s all
right, doesn’t matter.

305
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,699
It’s not your mistake.”

306
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:50,250
He was feeling so sad that Mother has been
insulted like this by this lady, because of

307
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,579
my mistake – I mean, it’s love.

308
00:28:52,579 --> 00:28:55,240
Now the power of his love was so great.

309
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,299
At the same moment there were so many, to
about fifty people, Sahaja yogis standing

310
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,040
on the balcony watching us.

311
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:10,250
We also felt and they also felt, but they
felt a tremendous cool breeze like a big blow

312
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:15,939
came to them and blew upon them vibrations,
and they just got enamored.

313
00:29:15,939 --> 00:29:20,370
And suddenly when they opened their eyes what
they find, the whole sky was filled with clouds.

314
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,650
There was not a single cloud.

315
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,689
In one second, in one second from where the
clouds came, God knows.

316
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:30,069
It was all completely filled with them.

317
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:34,319
Then they asked us to get out because they
could not do anything.

318
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,490
So when we came back it started raining.

319
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,410
When we came in, he got after that lady.

320
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,670
He said, “Now, whom are we to shout?

321
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,360
We can’t catch our planes now.”

322
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,780
And then they announced that all the flights
are cancelled.

323
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:57,240
So see the power of his love for his Mother
that the whole sky couldn’t bear it, you

324
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,449
see, the, his eyes became the sky.

325
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:06,000
And in a second they said, “Mother, we have
never seen such a miracle, that there is not

326
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,050
one single thing and the whole thing was filled
with this.”

327
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,410
So you must know your powers.

328
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,429
That is what is – first of all witness yourself,
is the introspection.

329
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:23,600
See for yourself how many powers you have
got.

330
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,340
Now with your left Vishuddhi you will always
conclude, “Oh, how can I have any powers?

331
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,710
After all, I have done this, I have done that.”

332
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,000
Even if you give somebody hundred pounds and
you tell him that now you go to the market,

333
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,120
buy something, he’ll say, “Oh, what’s
the use of this hundred pounds?” this, that.

334
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,569
Use it!

335
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:49,170
As simple as that.

336
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,290
But then Sahaja yogis start saying that “No,
no, no, no.

337
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,970
Mother says, but how can I have?

338
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,860
How can I have these powers, after all?

339
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,140
It’s not possible.

340
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,429
I’m no good.”

341
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:06,350
Because that left Vishuddhi’s all the time
telling that you are good for nothing.

342
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:16,280
It’s like a leaking hole in your brain that
takes away all the sense, and you accept it.

343
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:22,460
So first thing is to introspect yourself,
and see for yourself how many powers you have

344
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,460
got.

345
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,750
Like in the beginning no Sahaja yogi would
give realization, in India.

346
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,500
Nobody would even touch anyone.

347
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,470
It so happened that My car failed and I was
late two hours, luckily, and there was a big

348
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,829
meeting and they didn’t know what to do,
so they started giving realization to people.

349
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:47,840
And then they realized they can give realization;
otherwise they would not touch anyone.

350
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,049
Now you know that what you can do.

351
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:54,829
You also know that whatever you say happens.

352
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,829
Whatever you want you can get it.

353
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:56,829
Try, try, try!

354
00:31:56,829 --> 00:32:02,140
But if you don’t do it, then you’ll be
all the time half-baked.

355
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,929
Take the experience of your powers, see how
dynamic you are.

356
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:13,420
Don’t have formalities about it, just use
it fully, and you will be amazed that you

357
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,179
have so many powers.

358
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:19,070
Somebody told Me that “Mother, You have
given a siddhi to Guido.”

359
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,199
I have given siddhi to all of you.

360
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:26,410
I never discriminate; but it’s only he is
very brave, he’s used it left and right.

361
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,809
He uses left and right.

362
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:31,569
If you do not use your siddhis, what can I
do?

363
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:37,470
I’ve given you all the siddhis, no doubt
about it, so try.

364
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,429
Like in the beginning Baba Mama told Me that
“How can I write a poem?

365
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:46,260
I feel like writing but I am rather frightened,
because I could not even write an essay.”

366
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:52,710
I used to write essay for all My brothers,
you see, when they were studying.

367
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:56,189
I was very good at languages.

368
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,189
But that’s what he said, and now look at
him!

369
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:00,919
I told him, “You go ahead and write whatever
you write.”

370
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:03,450
He said, “I may write something wrong.”

371
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,710
“It doesn’t matter.

372
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,710
Write it.”

373
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:10,630
In the same way, somebody wants to paint something,
one should not think how they will criticize

374
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:15,170
or anything – just paint.

375
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,390
If you want to sing, just sing.

376
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:21,270
If you want to do anything, any manifestation,
just do it boldly.

377
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,830
Go in a big way.

378
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,579
You’ll be amazed at yourself how you have
achieved it and how you are doing it.

379
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:30,000
It has worked with so many artists, you know
that.

380
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,610
That day Debu told you about himself, and
in so many they can tell you that this has

381
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,870
happened to them.

382
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,929
So now the first thing is to know that you
have powers.

383
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:41,420
Now believe in them.

384
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,470
Have faith in yourself.

385
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,549
If you have left Vishuddhi, this Vishnumaya
won’t work out.

386
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,870
But be like Vishnumaya.

387
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,810
Just give up this guilt.

388
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,299
“No, I am a Sahaja yogi.

389
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,750
I’m not an ordinary person.”

390
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,390
People sometimes talk to Me and I say, “Do
you know what you are?”

391
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,390
“What, Mother?”

392
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,600
“You are a Sahaja yogi.”

393
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,659
“Oh, I forgot.”

394
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:12,759
“Now go and do it.”

395
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:20,549
And the another style of this left Vishuddhi
is this, which one must understand, that it

396
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:22,289
tries to give an explanation.

397
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:26,730
As I told you many a time, you tell somebody
that telephone to someone.

398
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,919
First they will say, “He may not be there,
Mother.”

399
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,169
“Baba, you telephone!

400
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:36,960
First find out if he may be there or may not
be there.”

401
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,099
But they would not.

402
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,409
They would just avoid, and that is another
thing.

403
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,169
Vishnumaya never avoids, you have seen that.

404
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:50,720
Once She has to shine She shines, wherever
She is, whatever She is.

405
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,550
So in the same way we have to be like that.

406
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:00,009
We have to know that we are special people,
we are chosen, we are angelic and that we

407
00:35:00,009 --> 00:35:04,700
have entered into the Kingdom of God, and
it will all work out.

408
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:07,670
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless people.

409
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:13,129
As I told you, in Marathi, Tukaram has said,
“Yeddya gabalyache kam nave.”

410
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:16,109
It’s not meant for lunatics and lousy people.

411
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:20,529
It’s meant for somebody who has tyala pahijet
jatiche.

412
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:22,849
You need people of character.

413
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:29,770
I know that there cannot be many like that,
but there is no place in God’s realm for

414
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,210
many people, for all these useless people.

415
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,489
It’s only for something special.

416
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:40,960
These seats are reserved and you have got
your realization now, somehow.

417
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,010
So now try to understand that this Vishnumaya
Principle has to be expressed and has to be

418
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,729
shown, and you introspect yourself: have I
done that or not?

419
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:55,270
Don’t be afraid that they say that “But
our ego will come up.”

420
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,270
Doesn’t matter.

421
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,030
You will also see your ego.

422
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:05,660
This is the second part of Shri Krishna’s
play, that in this Krita Yuga you see your

423
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
ego.

424
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:13,359
There was a lady who was rather not very kind
to some Maharashtrian ladies.

425
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,180
So I told her, “You have got right side.”

426
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
She wouldn’t believe.

427
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,819
She came to see Me in Rome, and she fell down
on right side, completely.

428
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:28,279
Then she realized that her right side was
not all right.

429
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:34,309
So to know that, whether you have a right
or a left, there’s a very good method, is

430
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:35,309
of meditation.

431
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:43,319
Now the third situation is that you must accept
whatever is wrong with you.

432
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,730
If you do not accept, then you have not been
kind to yourself.

433
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:55,129
That is the central part of it, that you must
accept, “Yes, this is something wrong with

434
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,129
me.

435
00:36:56,129 --> 00:37:01,839
I have gone in this part I’m wrong, of my
Vishuddhi, or that part I’m wrong.

436
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,339
So now I have to improve.”

437
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:09,700
Now, right Vishuddhi people will always try
to correct Me.

438
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
I’ve seen it.

439
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,879
It’s very simple for them.

440
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,069
If I say anything, “No.”

441
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,069
First words.

442
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,879
Different types “no’s” there are.

443
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:18,889
Sometimes, “No!”

444
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:29,420
Sometimes it is “No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!”

445
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:39,329
They will contradict Me or try to put their
own idea, and then they discover that it was

446
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,729
wrong; they should not have said it.

447
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:47,220
Say for example, if I say, “I saw these
things lying here.”

448
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,549
They said, “No.”

449
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:55,420
I said, “I saw with My own eyes and once
I see something, you know, it’s registers,

450
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,440
it’s there.”

451
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
“No.”

452
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,619
I say, “All right, just try to find out.”

453
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:00,619
“It’s there.

454
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:03,629
How is it we didn’t see?”

455
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:09,119
I said, “Because your ‘no’ was written
on your eyes, I think, you couldn’t see

456
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,119
anything.”

457
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,210
And then they’ll pull their ears – that’s
the best.

458
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:21,160
But if you see that “This is a habit I have
of saying no to things.”

459
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,349
So first of all, I also test you.

460
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:30,089
Supposing I say it is just now nine o’clock
in the night, you just say yes; let’s see

461
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:31,320
what happens.

462
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,170
Try to see.

463
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:43,270
You see, I test you many a times like this
and then I see that some people – if I say

464
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,069
so, all right, if it’s so, if Mother has
said, it is so.

465
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:52,229
And then it starts building up their faith
very well.

466
00:38:52,229 --> 00:39:04,650
I can see they’re, clearly how they are
coming into the realm of real faith, and there

467
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,930
when I say something absurd they’ll just
smile.

468
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:12,849
They know it is Mother is just testing us,
you see, so they just smile.

469
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:16,750
They wouldn’t do anything, but they’ll
just smile.

470
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:22,220
And then if it is so and if they don’t know,
they’ll say, “Yes, it must be.

471
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,680
Mother must have done this or said so.”

472
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,349
So your testing time is there.

473
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:29,859
You have to test yourself.

474
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:35,059
As Mohammed Sahib has said, that your hands
will speak and they’ll give witness against

475
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,249
you – so on your hands you will know.

476
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:43,079
Now these hands are the blessings of Shri
Krishna.

477
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:50,229
They come out from the same Vishuddhi, and
as you know the pelvic nerves serves it on

478
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:51,229
all that.

479
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:58,479
And there are two chakras of one Lalita, another
Shri Chakras, all on these both sides; they

480
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,230
also play into the hands of Shri Krishna.

481
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,089
With these hands we can feel the vibrations.

482
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:11,359
Now if your right Vishuddhi’s too strong
you may not feel, if your left Vishuddhi’s

483
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,990
too strong you may not feel, but that doesn’t
mean that you haven’t got realization.

484
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,990
You have got.

485
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,299
You just work out your hands.

486
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:27,570
Now for working your hands, you have to see
that you don’t use them for useless things.

487
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,629
That’s very important, because you have
special hands.

488
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:39,410
These hands are the ones with which you spread
the collectivity.

489
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:50,589
Now for example, Italy example this: here
the people when they talk, they’ll go on

490
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:54,960
… They don’t know anything what they are
saying, they only know their own, all their

491
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,389
gestures, and they only can depict.

492
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:03,690
For a person who doesn’t know them, on they’ll
go on like this, like this, all the time.

493
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,030
So this should be reduced.

494
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:09,670
There’s no need to use your hands so much
all the time, like this, like that.

495
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:15,129
Little bit, but while using the hands also
it should be decent, it should be regulated,

496
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:24,389
it should be
very indicative and useful.

497
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:28,379
Just showing off your hands is not good.

498
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:33,619
It is some sort of a theory came out, I was
told, that you must put your gestures into

499
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:36,059
your hands and speak.

500
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:38,980
Is all right for people like Hitler, but not
for us.

501
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,129
For us we should be decent.

502
00:41:41,129 --> 00:41:44,859
We should, whenever we have to say – now
for example, you want to point out something

503
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,460
to someone, shouldn’t say “do this.”

504
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,109
This is Shri Krishna’s finger, you can’t
use it like that.

505
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:55,930
Let them do, means supporting everything.

506
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,849
This looks better.

507
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,900
These hands are to be used for collectivity.

508
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,029
See, we say “namaste” when we meet others.

509
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,900
To thousands of people we can say “namaste.”

510
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,319
But I don’t like the shaking hands business
because it’s no good.

511
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,440
Shaking hands doesn’t create any collectivity.

512
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,789
On the contrary, you might get all kinds of
pins and needles and all kinds of problems

513
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,509
from others.

514
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:28,970
But when you talk to people also, with these
hands only you can feel them; with these hands

515
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:36,809
only you can care for your children; with
these hands only you can suggest your softness,

516
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:43,889
your sweetness, and also with the mouth – which
is of course is a part of the Vishuddhi, that’s

517
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:46,700
different – but specially hands.

518
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:56,480
Your gestures and everything should show very
heartfelt emotions, and then only these gestures

519
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,900
have some meaning.

520
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,960
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know, you hold each
other’s hands and the vibration starts flowing

521
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,710
among yourselves.

522
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:13,510
And you can also hear the tabla on your throbbings,
so that shows that they are the communication.

523
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:19,700
So these hands, which are really the beginning
of the collectivity – most important, I

524
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:28,269
would say the most important things are the
hands, which act for your collectivity.

525
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:36,470
As far as you are concerned there are many
other angels and other ganas who are standing

526
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,519
behind you.

527
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:44,450
They also, they extend their help to you whenever
you want to communicate something, they also

528
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,500
do your jobs very well.

529
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:56,359
So whatever is expressed in your hand or through
your hand, they immediately pick up.

530
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:06,920
As you know that Vishuddhi has sixteen petals,
and all ear, nose, throat, eyes, all are guided

531
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,519
by this.

532
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:15,589
Also the sub-plexus of this Vishuddhi is this
one, is the Hamsa Chakra.

533
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:22,180
So we have these eyes to see, eyes to communicate.

534
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:29,579
The pure eyes communicate pure love, purity.

535
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:37,889
With the pure eyes you can cleanse people,
with the pure eyes you can help others, you

536
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:40,139
can bring peace.

537
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,859
The purification of the eyes takes place through
your Vishuddhi and Agnya.

538
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:49,579
Here both things have to work out.

539
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:53,489
The nose is very important.

540
00:44:53,489 --> 00:45:03,289
Nose has to be pure, in the sense that you
should be able to discard whatever is smelling

541
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:08,010
badly, and you should be able to accept whatever
is fragrant.

542
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:16,259
It’s very important, because nose is the
speciality of Shri Krishna, I would say, in

543
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:23,950
the sense that He’s the Kubera, and the
Kubera has given the nose to the Goddess.

544
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:34,400
Some people have a bad habit of moving their
nose just to show disapproval or something

545
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,989
like this, they go on doing like that.

546
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:43,650
This is very wrong, because then you are insulting
yourself, you’re insulting your Kubera power.

547
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,849
So you have to keep your nose in a dignified
manner.

548
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,650
It should be a dignified nose.

549
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:56,070
It should not be used for doing something
which is undignified, or which expresses contempt.

550
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,839
Then your teeth are very important.

551
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:08,119
You have thirty-two teeth, see: sixteen of
Krishna’s powers divided into, you can say,

552
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,119
thirty-two.

553
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,660
These are your teeth on both the sides.

554
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:20,479
The right side is on top and the left down
below.

555
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:23,619
That is one thing we neglect very much in
the West, I must say.

556
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:24,700
In India it is not.

557
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,559
It is very much we neglect, and that’s what
we have to look after.

558
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:39,900
The reason for neglect is that, I would say,
is laziness, must be the laziness, but at

559
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,040
least twice or thrice you must brush your
teeth.

560
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:51,520
Is important, that I need not say, but more
important is to change the brush.

561
00:46:51,520 --> 00:47:01,519
Also you have to use butter, or salt and oil
to rub your gums.

562
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:09,819
If you rub your gums properly, you will never
have problems with your teeth and your gums.

563
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:15,609
Moreover, every time in the evening you must
again brush your teeth.

564
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,990
I’ve seen many people who come to Me in
the evening in the program, such a horrible

565
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,800
smell from their mouth comes out.

566
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,739
It is not that it’s a disease but it is,
only thing is that they have not cleansed

567
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:28,339
their teeth.

568
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:32,819
Also there are people who will not even brush
their teeth, and start eating breakfast.

569
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:37,589
I don’t know, it was another theory started,
I think, that you can eat your food without

570
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:38,599
brushing.

571
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,609
Teeth are very important, and one must look
after them.

572
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:53,769
On the teeth it depends all the qualities
of your Vishuddhi.

573
00:47:53,769 --> 00:48:02,849
So one has to look after the teeth in a proper
way, and should never clench and never show

574
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:05,220
temper with the teeth.

575
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,220
It’s a very bad habit.

576
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,349
Also here is a gesture I have seen that if
they don’t like something, they just go

577
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:10,389
on like this.

578
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:12,940
It’s a very wrong thing.

579
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:21,700
One should avoid that kind of a gesture, and
it’s very dangerous for your teeth.

580
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:30,730
So today’s lecture is more sort of medical,
I must say.

581
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:46,389
A person who is spiritually endowed has an
expression which can never be aggressive.

582
00:48:46,389 --> 00:48:54,539
He may not be good-looking, may not be very,
a sort of a attractive personality, but the

583
00:48:54,539 --> 00:49:00,920
expression on the face is absolutely saintly.

584
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,000
That is also the blessings of Shri Krishna.

585
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:18,950
I have seen people after one year of realization,
and I was surprised how their faces were changed,

586
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:23,069
that I could not recognize them who they were.

587
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:30,940
The whole thing becomes absolutely mild, soft,
peaceful and very joyous.

588
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:37,569
All the qualities of Shri Krishna can be expressed
on your face.

589
00:49:37,569 --> 00:49:40,359
You can be sometimes mischievous to look at.

590
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:50,900
So many expressions there are which come on
the face, and give you a very sweet feeling.

591
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,569
But some people have a habit of looking in
the mirror all the time, which is very wrong,

592
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:59,759
because it gives you a kind of a funny ego.

593
00:49:59,759 --> 00:50:04,879
Is better to look at Shri Krishna’s photograph
than to look at your own faces, so that your

594
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:08,930
face will become like that of Shri Krishna;
instead of you start looking in the mirror

595
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:10,180
all the time.

596
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:15,750
What will become of you, God knows, because
maybe if you go to your past, God knows what

597
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,869
you’ll become.

598
00:50:16,869 --> 00:50:21,069
So also I’m thankful to psychiatrists that
they don’t like narcissism.

599
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:26,219
But it’s very dangerous to all the time
watch your face in the mirror, very dangerous.

600
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:31,160
It creates a very funny personality, that
you start telling yourself, “Oh, I’m Napoleon.”

601
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,609
So you become Napoleon, and start behaving
like Napoleon.

602
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:41,710
Next day you find one Napoleon walks out of
the bathroom!

603
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:50,220
So one has to be careful not to pay so much
attention and importance to your own self,

604
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,710
but to your Self which is within, which is
your spirit.

605
00:50:53,710 --> 00:51:00,420
And if you look after that side, then all
these things will happen in such a beautiful

606
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,480
manner.

607
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,989
Also the hair are looked after by Shri Krishna.

608
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:11,559
Now you see, you know that He’s very fond
of anything that is like butter, so you have

609
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:14,950
to put either butter or oil or something in
your hair.

610
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:17,660
If you don’t put it you’ll become bald.

611
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,200
What can – I mean it is after all a karma
phala.

612
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,089
If you don’t put oil, you’ll become bald.

613
00:51:24,089 --> 00:51:29,819
So you have to put oil, and oil was put always
before in the West.

614
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:34,299
I see all these old films and all that, they’re
all oiled people.

615
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:39,619
But now of course, if you don’t want to
put oil in the daytime you can wash it off,

616
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:45,030
but at least once a week you must oil your
head.

617
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:50,069
Shri Krishna’s star is Saturn, Shani.

618
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:59,720
They say that if He gets after somebody, then
nobody can be saved.

619
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,619
If Shri Krishna gets after someone, then nobody
can be saved.

620
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:09,230
In the same way, if Saturn gets after someone
then that person is finished, so we say it’s

621
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,329
for sometimes, it is seven years He’s after
you, or sometimes two-and-a-half years after

622
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:14,329
you.

623
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:26,349
So this Saturn of Shri Krishna is a, it’s
a quality within us that, supposing if somebody

624
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:31,400
troubles us or does something, we don’t
have to do anything.

625
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:40,410
Now this Shri Krishna policy, this, we can
say, the Shri Krishna’s nature will work

626
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,589
it out.

627
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:52,099
It will inform this all-pervading Power, and
through that this man or this woman, or this

628
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:56,309
party or this organization which is trying
to trouble us will be hounded, while we’ll

629
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:57,789
be just sitting doing nothing.

630
00:52:57,789 --> 00:53:03,289
They’ll be just hounded till they jump in
the sea.

631
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,680
[missing part] plays around, but
He doesn’t forgive.

632
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:08,980
He doesn’t believe in forgiveness.

633
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,140
He says, “Now, you had enough of it.”

634
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:18,780
He gives a big, big long rope to hang yourself,
but He never forgives.

635
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,740
One thing for definite, He never forgives.

636
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,220
As you must have seen in Mahabharata His own
judgment of things, you see, He doesn’t

637
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,220
forgive.

638
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,220
He says, “You have to pay.

639
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,270
You have to pay for it.”

640
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,873
Except when, when you transcend.

641
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:49,192
If you become a Sahaja yogi, if you have transcended
Vishuddhi, then He cannot do anything like

642
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,333
that to you.

643
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:57,553
But if you have not, if there’s no ascent
you cannot be saved, you cannot be saved from

644
00:53:57,553 --> 00:53:58,553
Him.

645
00:53:58,553 --> 00:54:03,523
They say once Mohammed Gajani came to loot
our country – I mean, it’s a story about

646
00:54:03,523 --> 00:54:06,632
the village folk.

647
00:54:06,632 --> 00:54:12,603
And there he’s looted Somnath, a big temple
of ours, which had lots of gold, jewelry,

648
00:54:12,603 --> 00:54:14,393
everything in it.

649
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:19,575
So these brahmins were, you see, taking money
from all these people and looting them, and

650
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:27,543
putting them in the temple and using them,
and the rest of the people were very poor.

651
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:35,363
So it was sort of a reaction in them, and
the story they tell like this: so this Mohammed

652
00:54:35,363 --> 00:54:40,343
Gajani looted Somnath, is the temple of Mahadeva.

653
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:46,062
Now Mahadeva never needs any ornaments or
anything, but they had put this there.

654
00:54:46,062 --> 00:54:54,783
So Hanumana saw that Mahadeva got out of the
temple and was running, so Hanumana ran after

655
00:54:54,783 --> 00:54:55,783
Him.

656
00:54:55,783 --> 00:55:00,063
Then at one point Mahadeva sat down, and Hanumana
came.

657
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,033
He said, “You are the God of Gods.

658
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,442
Why are You running?

659
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:06,212
What are You afraid of?”

660
00:55:06,212 --> 00:55:08,533
He said, “You don’t know this Mohammed
Gajani?”

661
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,212
He said, “No I don’t know.”

662
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:11,892
“All right, hide behind a tree.”

663
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,293
They hid behind a tree.

664
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:17,852
So this Mohammed Gajani came and sat down
– this is the folklore I’m telling, folk

665
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:21,842
people tell – sat down under that tree.

666
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:27,482
And turning to Shri Krishna, he said, “This
horrible thing, if He gets after someone,

667
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:29,732
who can be saved?

668
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:33,922
Under my nose these brahmins were making money
and all that, putting it in Somnath temple,

669
00:55:33,922 --> 00:55:35,992
which was not to be done.

670
00:55:35,992 --> 00:55:41,863
I couldn’t do anything, so He came, and
with this fellow after me I cannot be saved

671
00:55:41,863 --> 00:55:45,302
either, so I am running away from the temple.”

672
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:52,053
So this is the story given by the villagers,
but which shows that if Shri Krishna is after

673
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:56,742
somebody, then nobody can save that person,
he has to run away; because He has so many

674
00:55:56,742 --> 00:56:01,462
tricks and so many styles that you can’t
get out of it.

675
00:56:01,462 --> 00:56:06,302
He’ll use His brains in so many manners,
and that He’ll put that person right who

676
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:08,732
is trying to trouble you.

677
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:16,083
So you must have complete faith in the powers
of Shri Krishna which is within yourself,

678
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,972
which is being aware now.

679
00:56:17,972 --> 00:56:23,942
And also if you have ascended fully out of
this, then He will not trouble; but if you

680
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:28,793
have left Vishuddhi He will trouble you, definitely.

681
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:31,682
If you have left Vishuddhi Shri Krishna will
definitely trouble you, and be careful.

682
00:56:31,682 --> 00:56:34,492
So get rid of your left Vishuddhis now.

683
00:56:34,492 --> 00:56:35,712
That’s very important.

684
00:56:35,712 --> 00:56:41,853
Because then Shri Krishna will take your test
and will make you so miserable that you will

685
00:56:41,853 --> 00:56:42,952
not know why.

686
00:56:42,952 --> 00:56:47,722
“Mother, You see, I did this, I did this
puja, I did this till, let’s see now, this

687
00:56:47,722 --> 00:56:49,932
is the situation in my family.

688
00:56:49,932 --> 00:56:51,313
This is what happened.”

689
00:56:51,313 --> 00:56:54,602
“All right, are you a Catholic?”

690
00:56:54,602 --> 00:56:55,602
“Yes.”

691
00:56:55,602 --> 00:56:56,862
“Feel guilty?”

692
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:57,862
“Yes.”

693
00:56:57,862 --> 00:56:59,882
“So have it.”

694
00:56:59,882 --> 00:57:00,882
What can I do?

695
00:57:00,882 --> 00:57:03,073
Shri Krishna cannot be controlled by anyone.

696
00:57:03,073 --> 00:57:09,742
He does whatever He thinks proper and He is
meant to really punish much more than the

697
00:57:09,742 --> 00:57:12,732
Mother, I can tell you.

698
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:18,402
They say that She’s Adi Rudra, Adi Saumya:
She’s the one who’s very hard and also

699
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:22,682
very, very soft, but up to a point.

700
00:57:22,682 --> 00:57:24,102
He is not.

701
00:57:24,102 --> 00:57:25,302
Nothing can convince Him.

702
00:57:25,302 --> 00:57:32,212
Once you get into His control, that He’ll
see to it that you are put right, left, right,

703
00:57:32,212 --> 00:57:34,932
any way He’ll make you all right.

704
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:40,482
So one thing is there, that you should be
sure that you should have your Vishuddhis

705
00:57:40,482 --> 00:57:47,592
all right, first of all, and also get Shri
Krishna manifesting on others.

706
00:57:47,592 --> 00:57:49,253
You don’t have to do anything.

707
00:57:49,253 --> 00:57:51,365
He’ll look after you, everything, and work
it out.

708
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:55,773
But left Vishuddhi is a disease of the West.

709
00:57:55,773 --> 00:58:00,663
I also feel so much from you all that I sometimes
feel like running away to India, because in

710
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:02,692
India nobody feels guilty.

711
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:04,803
They don’t believe in feeling guilty.

712
00:58:04,803 --> 00:58:05,853
“What is there?

713
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:07,313
We have not murdered anyone.

714
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:09,043
Why should we feel guilty?”

715
00:58:09,043 --> 00:58:12,033
Here it is a disease with everyone, “I feel
guilty.”

716
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:19,452
I don’t know who has introduced this idea,
maybe this Catholic Church, but carried too

717
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:20,452
far.

718
00:58:20,452 --> 00:58:26,842
So then we come to the Virata's point, is
here.

719
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:33,122
Before that we have to cross the Hamsa; without
that you cannot reach the Virat point.

720
00:58:33,122 --> 00:58:40,543
So Hamsa is as you know very well, is the
discretion, divine discretion, which must

721
00:58:40,543 --> 00:58:43,872
be within you.

722
00:58:43,872 --> 00:58:48,462
Once you develop that, then you don’t commit
mistakes.

723
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:54,132
You never commit mistakes – mistakes in
the sense you don’t do things which are

724
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:56,702
again pushed back on you, or for which you
have to pay.

725
00:58:56,702 --> 00:58:59,793
It’s just a very straightforward life.

726
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:01,162
“It’s so?

727
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,523
It’s so.”

728
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:08,343
With this discretion, absolutely you have
a complete understanding as to what has to

729
00:59:08,343 --> 00:59:11,083
be done and what not to be done.

730
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,322
And if that is established, a discretion is
established.

731
00:59:14,322 --> 00:59:19,302
In many Sahaja yogis, I must say, discretion
has come even with their left Vishuddhi.

732
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:23,523
Even if they have left Vishuddhi they have
this discretion, they know what is right and

733
00:59:23,523 --> 00:59:24,523
what is wrong.

734
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:31,263
With that divine discretion, the first thing
that happens is that people get impressed

735
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:32,263
by you.

736
00:59:32,263 --> 00:59:34,783
It’s real collectivity, it impresses the
collectivity.

737
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:39,892
A person who has divine discretion, people
immediately see the wisdom of that person

738
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:42,784
and think, “See now, this man, how could
he be?

739
00:59:42,784 --> 00:59:44,742
He’s so young, how could he be?

740
00:59:44,742 --> 00:59:47,822
He’s such a child, how could he be?”

741
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:57,072
So this divine discretion which is the, here,
Hamsa Chakra’s speciality, when it starts

742
00:59:57,072 --> 01:00:05,302
manifesting then automatically you impress,
automatically you impress the collectivity.

743
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:09,732
This is a very important point one has to
know.

744
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:15,073
While introspecting yourself, you just see
if you have developed this quality of divine

745
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,152
discretion or not.

746
01:00:16,152 --> 01:00:20,533
For example, there are many I have seen when
they come to the program, they come and tell

747
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,783
Me, “Mother, some Sahaja yogi told me that
‘You have a bhoot.’

748
01:00:23,783 --> 01:00:26,132
Have I got a bhoot in me?”

749
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:27,813
I said, “Not at all.

750
01:00:27,813 --> 01:00:30,513
How can there be any bhoot in you?”

751
01:00:30,513 --> 01:00:36,632
He may be having, but the divine discretion
is not to tell him just now, but to remove

752
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:37,632
it.

753
01:00:37,632 --> 01:00:48,063
So divine discretion gives you a complete
understanding what is the way to handle another

754
01:00:48,063 --> 01:00:56,132
personality, what is the way to handle a collective,
how to talk to others, how to impress on them

755
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:57,753
the right things.

756
01:00:57,753 --> 01:01:05,682
It’s a very, very expansive manifestation
in so many directions.

757
01:01:05,682 --> 01:01:09,142
If you have no divine discretion, you’ll
start speaking what you should not speak,

758
01:01:09,142 --> 01:01:14,053
you’ll start saying at a time when you should
not say.

759
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:18,153
I mean, you’ll have no sense at all of any
direction.

760
01:01:18,153 --> 01:01:25,132
So to have divine discretion is very important,
for which as you know, Hamsa Chakra physically

761
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:30,873
as well mentally and also spiritually must
be kept all right.

762
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:37,073
In My Hamsas – we had one puja where I talked
about it.

763
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:41,563
The last is the Virat: that is the state you
have to reach.

764
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:46,842
Is the Virat is here in front, as you know.

765
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:56,312
And I was surprised when I went to Nepal,
which is a temple of Shiva there: despite

766
01:01:56,312 --> 01:02:01,822
they were worshipping Shiva they were putting
all the kumkum here.

767
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:06,652
So I thought that they don’t know why they
are putting, because even if you worship Shiva

768
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:09,692
you must also worship here, the Virata.

769
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:17,742
They don’t put it here – here; because
they’re absolutely hundred percent only

770
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:22,312
Shiva worshippers, so why should they put
it here?

771
01:02:22,312 --> 01:02:32,472
Because somebody who knows, who was gnostic,
has told them that this is the place of Virat.

772
01:02:32,472 --> 01:02:49,962
Once you get into Virata, then all your ideas
of separating or differentiating goes away.

773
01:02:49,962 --> 01:02:59,212
You do not have any more ideas of races left,
of nationality, of your city, of your village

774
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:00,492
or anything.

775
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:07,212
At that stage you don’t belong to any place.

776
01:03:07,212 --> 01:03:09,462
You belong to every place, and you don’t
belong to every place.

777
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:14,872
Such a situation comes in when you don’t
hanker after any particular food, you don’t

778
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:24,802
like any particular type of people, you can
adjust yourself into any circumstances, into

779
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:29,442
any families, into any kind of people.

780
01:03:29,442 --> 01:03:31,062
You can live with drunkards.

781
01:03:31,062 --> 01:03:38,802
I mean I have lived with drunkards – “lived”
means I have shaken hands at least with so

782
01:03:38,802 --> 01:03:40,172
many of them.

783
01:03:40,172 --> 01:03:43,382
You can be with any kind of person.

784
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:48,932
Nothing bothers you because you are in the
Virata state; because everything is absorbed

785
01:03:48,932 --> 01:03:52,202
by the Virat, and you do not feel anything.

786
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:55,503
Whatever sort of person may be, you do not
feel it.

787
01:03:55,503 --> 01:04:01,273
The Virat has to suffer, not you, and that
is what is the best state where I want all

788
01:04:01,273 --> 01:04:07,162
of you to reach, and to become absolutely
free.

789
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:13,283
Nothing can impress you, nothing can influence
you, nothing can dissuade you, but you stand

790
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:18,802
on your self-esteem and understanding about
yourself, that you’re a Sahaja yogi and

791
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:28,832
that you are connected with this power, and
you are a citizen of Kingdom of God.

792
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:39,952
At the Virata state there's no doubt left
about it, no doubt, because you become part

793
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:44,872
and parcel of the whole, absolutely, and you
can affect anywhere.

794
01:04:44,872 --> 01:04:47,132
If this finger is hurt, then this finger can
feel it.

795
01:04:47,132 --> 01:04:56,033
In the same way such a person is felt everywhere,
and not only that, but that person can be

796
01:04:56,033 --> 01:04:57,952
effective everywhere.

797
01:04:57,952 --> 01:05:05,112
For that state of reaching to Virat, one should
try to slowly, gradually, “Ya neti neti

798
01:05:05,112 --> 01:05:07,382
vachanaih nirgama avochu” say.

799
01:05:07,382 --> 01:05:09,692
You have to go on saying, “This is not my
sister.

800
01:05:09,692 --> 01:05:11,112
This is not my brother.

801
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:13,052
They are all my brothers.

802
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:14,622
They’re all my sisters.

803
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:18,783
I love them the same as my sisters and my
brothers.

804
01:05:18,783 --> 01:05:20,372
This is not my family.

805
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:23,342
The whole Sahaja Yoga is my family.”

806
01:05:23,342 --> 01:05:27,082
The whole attention should move like that.

807
01:05:27,082 --> 01:05:31,632
“This is not only mine, it is everybody’s.

808
01:05:31,632 --> 01:05:34,192
It belongs to everyone.

809
01:05:34,192 --> 01:05:36,382
Everybody has a right.”

810
01:05:36,382 --> 01:05:41,432
That sort of a thing, when it starts growing
from individual, what we call is the “vestiti

811
01:05:41,432 --> 01:05:48,712
tu sumestiti” in Sanskrit, they say “vestiti
tu sumestiti,” from individual to collective.

812
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:54,972
And such a personality then is the most effective
one for any kind of collective work.

813
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:59,142
I think for today it’s quite sufficient
for you to know about Vishuddhi Chakra.

814
01:05:59,142 --> 01:06:05,182
I mean, I have talked about it thousands and
thousands of times, and now this is one of

815
01:06:05,182 --> 01:06:10,273
the sides which I wanted to say, because I
find that still there are people who do not

816
01:06:10,273 --> 01:06:13,732
understand that they have to rise above Vishuddhi.

817
01:06:13,732 --> 01:06:20,363
Otherwise, if they do not ascend over Vishuddhi
they can never be proper Sahaja yogis, they’ll

818
01:06:20,363 --> 01:06:22,172
be always half-baked.

819
01:06:22,172 --> 01:06:29,682
So we must try to rise above the Vishuddhi,
the discretion part.

820
01:06:29,692 --> 01:06:37,869
Then at that point we can never doubt Sahaja
Yoga, can never doubt, and that’s how the

821
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:40,594
doubtless awareness can come to us.

822
01:06:41,509 --> 01:06:43,451
May God bless you.

823
01:06:54,938 --> 01:06:55,938
All right.

824
01:06:56,058 --> 01:07:02,318
Shri Krishna Puja is very small that way,
not such a long thing.
