WEBVTT

00:00.583 --> 00:06.250
Today we have come here

00:07.333 --> 00:12.208
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.166
It's such a coincidence

00:17.166 --> 00:19.458
that the Mother of Christ

00:19.458 --> 00:22.166
came and stayed in Turkey.

00:22.875 --> 00:25.333
Isn't it surprising

00:25.375 --> 00:27.333
that She should come here

00:28.542 --> 00:33.041
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

00:33.458 --> 00:37.959
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

00:38.333 --> 00:40.709
But they say then He went to Kashmir

00:40.917 --> 00:42.834
and She was also there.

00:43.417 --> 00:46.083
Quite possible, on their way

00:46.250 --> 00:48.500
they might have gone there.

00:49.166 --> 00:54.834
So we are here to worship Him.

01:03.709 --> 01:05.250
According to Sahaja Yoga,

01:06.834 --> 01:09.542
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

01:11.291 --> 01:15.834
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

01:16.291 --> 01:21.250
for the sake of religion.

01:22.375 --> 01:25.250
But unfortunately,

01:25.583 --> 01:27.959
nobody understood Her value.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.041
Nobody saw

01:32.166 --> 01:37.375
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

01:37.875 --> 01:40.125
Only through Sahaja Yoga

01:40.625 --> 01:42.792
you can understand that She was

01:43.041 --> 01:45.834
a very great personality

01:46.083 --> 01:50.125
who gave birth to Christ.

01:55.709 --> 01:59.959
It is very unfortunate

02:01.375 --> 02:03.417
that She was not respected,

02:04.750 --> 02:08.166
specially in the Islamic world.

02:08.875 --> 02:10.083
Because of that,

02:10.959 --> 02:17.458
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

02:19.667 --> 02:24.250
My experience is very sad about them.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.750
We have started an organization

02:29.917 --> 02:32.250
for the rehabilitation of women

02:32.792 --> 02:36.417
who are destitutes and all of them

02:36.750 --> 02:41.208
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

02:42.959 --> 02:44.875
While Muhammed Sahib has said

02:44.875 --> 02:47.959
that "you must look after your mother"

02:48.709 --> 02:51.250
despite that all these women

02:51.834 --> 02:56.750
some of them have eight children, ten children

02:57.041 --> 02:59.792
- have come to this destitute home.

03:00.709 --> 03:03.750
Of course, we have to give them place.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.333
We have to look after them

03:06.333 --> 03:08.667
because we don't believe in all these

03:08.959 --> 03:13.750
small type of ideas about religion.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.667
Most important is 'human' religion.

03:19.709 --> 03:22.792
We have to combine all these religions together.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.333
It's a terrible task

03:26.959 --> 03:31.166
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.625
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.291
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.583
They all are for God

03:41.417 --> 03:43.917
and for God's work and His love.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.625
Despite that, there's no respect.

03:48.417 --> 03:49.458
There's no love.

03:50.709 --> 03:53.166
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

03:53.333 --> 03:57.125
killing everywhere.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.667
It's very sad

04:00.875 --> 04:03.750
that in the name of religion and God,

04:04.041 --> 04:08.333
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.792
This is the only solution-

04:13.750 --> 04:15.959
is to give them Self Realization,

04:17.458 --> 04:21.291
which is the Realization

04:21.583 --> 04:27.291
was called as miraj in the Koran.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.709
It's called as miraj.

04:29.750 --> 04:33.250
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.250
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

04:37.709 --> 04:39.959
- like they have banned people

04:40.208 --> 04:42.083
from getting Self Realization,

04:42.583 --> 04:43.667
which is not true.

04:44.709 --> 04:49.000
All human beings can get Self Realization.

04:50.250 --> 04:54.166
Whether they are from Africa,

04:54.959 --> 04:58.417
England, America, India, anywhere.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.792
They all can get their miraj.

05:03.542 --> 05:07.125
One should understand that no human being

05:07.458 --> 05:09.959
is created in this world to fight,

05:10.417 --> 05:11.875
to fight each other.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.834
Even the animals don't fight.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.625
Why should human beings fight

05:17.917 --> 05:19.709
- that, too, in the name of religion.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.542
In the name of God,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.792
Christ came on this Earth

05:26.125 --> 05:28.166
just to create oneness of religion,

05:29.083 --> 05:32.959
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

05:33.750 --> 05:35.250
dominating others.

05:35.875 --> 05:38.875
It's a big world of turmoil,

05:39.500 --> 05:43.750
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

05:43.959 --> 05:46.625
and in the name of religion.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.291
So our religion is global,

05:51.333 --> 05:52.709
is one religion.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.583
We respect all the Deities,

05:57.125 --> 05:59.125
all the Gods and Goddesses

06:00.291 --> 06:03.625
- respect Them and worship Them.

06:04.542 --> 06:08.291
We are not so stupid

06:09.417 --> 06:12.834
not to understand that They are all one.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.041
Also, after getting Realization,

06:16.375 --> 06:19.625
you realize that all these exist

06:19.834 --> 06:22.250
on our central nervous system.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.250
They exist on our chakras.

06:26.333 --> 06:29.083
They are not there

06:30.750 --> 06:34.250
just because people have told us in history and all that,

06:34.542 --> 06:36.333
but actually in that's a fact,

06:37.542 --> 06:39.834
that all of them are there together,

06:40.250 --> 06:43.417
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.250
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

06:47.750 --> 06:49.542
is the resurrection part

06:50.250 --> 06:53.875
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

06:54.083 --> 06:57.000
He had to go through lots of ordeals

06:57.542 --> 07:00.500
and then His body itself was resurrected.

07:02.166 --> 07:04.792
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

07:05.542 --> 07:07.750
- that you get your Realization

07:08.250 --> 07:09.792
means your resurrection.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.125
All your wrong ideas disappear.

07:14.208 --> 07:16.291
All your nonsense disappears

07:16.959 --> 07:18.667
and nothing but love,

07:19.375 --> 07:22.208
understanding comes in.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.166
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

07:26.834 --> 07:31.000
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

07:31.208 --> 07:33.625
I found people are so ignorant

07:33.959 --> 07:36.333
and human beings hate each other.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.500
With some excuse, ......... with

07:40.709 --> 07:44.458
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

07:44.667 --> 07:48.166
historical ideas, and they hate.

07:50.250 --> 07:53.583
This hating in India has been there,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.709
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.500
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.834
He was a satanic force who incarnated

08:05.166 --> 08:07.709
and did all kinds of horrible things.

08:08.667 --> 08:10.875
The way he has killed people,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.542
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.750
He killed children.

08:18.667 --> 08:23.417
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

08:23.917 --> 08:25.792
- such a horrible thing.

08:26.917 --> 08:27.959
When I went to Germany,

08:28.208 --> 08:30.166
they wanted Me to see all that.

08:30.375 --> 08:35.250
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

08:36.000 --> 08:37.625
But My husband went there

08:38.834 --> 08:42.542
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

08:43.542 --> 08:44.583
It's so sickening.

08:45.083 --> 08:48.375
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

08:49.041 --> 08:52.291
to kill people, under some circumstances,

08:52.834 --> 08:56.458
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

08:58.542 --> 09:01.959
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

09:02.041 --> 09:06.125
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

09:08.542 --> 09:11.291
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

09:12.166 --> 09:15.375
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

09:16.333 --> 09:19.250
Throughout, people have been killing

09:19.417 --> 09:20.834
in the name of religion.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.542
Religion teaches you to love,

09:24.458 --> 09:26.709
to love God and love each other.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.959
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

09:32.542 --> 09:35.000
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.041
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.917
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

09:43.667 --> 09:47.000
and it should because, after all,

09:47.250 --> 09:48.792
we are all human beings.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.166
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

09:52.500 --> 09:54.083
as Christ had.

09:54.709 --> 09:58.500
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

09:59.125 --> 10:01.166
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.500
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

10:05.709 --> 10:08.500
He's described it very well, very clearly.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.917
But who wants that?

10:12.250 --> 10:14.125
They don't want to have their miraj.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.709
If somebody tries to work it out,

10:17.125 --> 10:19.959
they get after that person, saying

10:20.166 --> 10:22.208
that  "This is something ridiculous."

10:24.125 --> 10:25.333
It's all wrong.

10:26.250 --> 10:30.750
I mean this has happened with all of them.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.500
All of them have suffered

10:33.792 --> 10:36.834
because of the ignorance  of human beings - all of them.

10:38.500 --> 10:44.250
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

10:45.208 --> 10:48.000
But I am much more powerful,

10:48.333 --> 10:51.291
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.625
And it's working out all over the world now,

10:54.834 --> 10:59.333
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

10:59.542 --> 11:03.667
this kind of a wrong idea about others

11:04.250 --> 11:06.917
is absolutely dangerous.

11:08.208 --> 11:14.000
And so, once large number of people know this,

11:15.125 --> 11:17.166
I'm sure it will all finish off.

11:19.500 --> 11:23.458
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.709
That just because you follow a particular religion,

11:28.125 --> 11:29.250
people hate you.

11:30.166 --> 11:31.667
I mean I can't understand.

11:33.917 --> 11:36.792
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

11:36.792 --> 11:41.875
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

11:42.417 --> 11:46.750
in the name of God, who has created you.

11:47.125 --> 11:49.417
They don't understand God and His love.

11:53.083 --> 11:57.583
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.500
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

12:00.792 --> 12:04.291
when He was crucified.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.333
His mother had to suffer so much.

12:10.417 --> 12:13.083
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

12:13.875 --> 12:16.375
Because He was teaching about love.

12:17.625 --> 12:21.875
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.542
How can you help people if you don't love?

12:27.291 --> 12:32.792
Under what premises do you help others?

12:34.291 --> 12:35.792
Because you love,

12:36.583 --> 12:39.834
that's why you want to enjoy others

12:40.125 --> 12:41.709
and to understand.

12:41.750 --> 12:44.250
Once you start loving others,

12:44.709 --> 12:49.166
then this myth finishes off.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.583
Supposing you are born as a Christian

12:52.834 --> 12:55.125
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

12:57.750 --> 13:02.250
what makes you think that you are different from others?

13:03.792 --> 13:05.333
You are born the same way.

13:06.542 --> 13:08.917
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.291
You look the same way.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.834
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

13:15.959 --> 13:17.417
What makes you different?

13:19.125 --> 13:21.667
I think it's something political about it,

13:23.583 --> 13:25.041
something very mean

13:25.792 --> 13:30.166
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.542
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

13:33.750 --> 13:36.458
unite all the people in the name of God,

13:37.917 --> 13:40.375
to make them one in the name of God.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.875
Supposing there is somebody living,

13:44.625 --> 13:47.250
say, in South Africa

13:48.583 --> 13:53.041
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

13:53.291 --> 13:54.917
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.792
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.291
They are all your bothers and sisters.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.625
They're your own.

14:04.166 --> 14:06.625
You go there and they will

14:06.917 --> 14:09.709
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

14:12.959 --> 14:15.583
They will never think what religion you come from

14:15.959 --> 14:18.583
or what sect you come from, nothing.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.083
I was surprised the way they have love.

14:22.709 --> 14:26.291
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.875
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

14:31.041 --> 14:34.875
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

14:35.709 --> 14:40.792
But that capacity has become so much less,

14:41.417 --> 14:45.333
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

14:45.625 --> 14:50.417
people fight and kill each other.

14:52.417 --> 14:56.625
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

14:58.917 --> 15:00.709
I don't know what - how they believe

15:01.250 --> 15:04.875
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.750
They will go to the worst hell.

15:10.041 --> 15:14.375
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

15:14.750 --> 15:16.709
but still existing.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.291
They see it happening every day,

15:19.959 --> 15:24.917
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.250
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

15:28.458 --> 15:29.542
We should think.

15:30.458 --> 15:34.041
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.667
You have to be born in some religion.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.041
You cannot drop from heaven.

15:40.875 --> 15:45.959
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

15:47.083 --> 15:51.834
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.750
And then you go on crying and weeping

15:55.959 --> 16:02.917
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.458
How can that be? We are human beings.

16:06.959 --> 16:07.959
They are not animals.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.041
Even the dogs don't do that way.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.500
Why should we human beings kill each other

16:14.583 --> 16:21.959
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

16:23.291 --> 16:25.083
Because if you hate others,

16:26.041 --> 16:28.041
you will also become hateful.

16:29.041 --> 16:33.417
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

16:33.834 --> 16:36.959
so the whole human life and civilization

16:37.208 --> 16:39.583
has nothing to do but to hate!

16:43.959 --> 16:46.834
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

16:47.583 --> 16:51.709
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

16:52.166 --> 16:54.792
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

16:55.041 --> 16:58.208
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.709
It's very remarkable when I came here.

17:07.041 --> 17:10.250
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.625
There is a house of Mother Mary.

17:15.250 --> 17:20.333
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

17:21.166 --> 17:23.375
and so I said we must worship Her.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.500
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

17:28.458 --> 17:29.625
Mother is a mother.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.208
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

17:34.417 --> 17:35.750
It doesn't matter.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.333
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

17:41.041 --> 17:44.291
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

17:45.834 --> 17:47.750
Can you find such a mother in this world

17:48.458 --> 17:52.500
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

17:55.208 --> 18:01.125
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.291
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

18:06.875 --> 18:08.375
because She lived here.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.125
Why did She come?

18:12.417 --> 18:14.875
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

18:15.834 --> 18:20.792
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.750
Now with this house only,

18:22.959 --> 18:25.083
the Christians will start a cult.

18:26.458 --> 18:29.709
They'll fight with the Muslims

18:30.083 --> 18:33.500
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.875
Anything you do, they will fight.

18:36.417 --> 18:39.333
That's the main character is to fight,

18:39.834 --> 18:43.834
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

18:45.041 --> 18:49.709
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

18:51.709 --> 18:55.917
In India we have had so many nice people

18:56.125 --> 18:58.250
who taught that we must love each other.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.792
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

19:03.959 --> 19:06.417
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.792
In the same way, in India also,

19:09.375 --> 19:13.709
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.959
Some of them were Muslims,

19:16.500 --> 19:18.083
some of them were Hindus

19:18.583 --> 19:21.333
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

19:21.667 --> 19:27.667
But, they're worshipped separately

19:27.875 --> 19:30.250
and people fight even in their names.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.959
They want to find something to fight.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.667
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.583
They haven't got a human quality within them,

19:39.959 --> 19:43.792
which is love, which is affection-

19:44.875 --> 19:47.750
must enjoy your love for each other.

19:48.583 --> 19:52.166
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

19:53.375 --> 19:56.542
What does it matter if somebody is born

19:56.834 --> 19:59.208
in China or in India or anywhere?

19:59.917 --> 20:01.333
He is a human being.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.750
He, too, has the capacity to love

20:05.125 --> 20:08.417
and you should also have capacity to love.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.709
My experience is different.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.083
I went to China with My husband.

20:17.041 --> 20:17.959
In China

20:18.166 --> 20:20.959
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

20:21.208 --> 20:22.125
I don't know why.

20:23.458 --> 20:26.792
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

20:28.166 --> 20:29.542
so nice to Me

20:30.709 --> 20:32.250
and the way they treated Me,

20:32.458 --> 20:34.750
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter?  "

20:36.291 --> 20:37.959
"How are they so kind to you? "

20:38.458 --> 20:40.500
"In China they don't like Indians."

20:41.417 --> 20:42.583
I said, "It's a myth. "

20:42.959 --> 20:45.333
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

20:46.250 --> 20:52.125
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

20:53.291 --> 20:55.291
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

20:55.875 --> 20:58.417
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

20:59.500 --> 21:03.834
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

21:06.500 --> 21:12.667
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

21:13.667 --> 21:17.250
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

21:17.792 --> 21:18.875
Can you imagine?

21:20.250 --> 21:24.959
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

21:26.625 --> 21:29.500
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

21:29.709 --> 21:31.542
extremely loving."

21:32.125 --> 21:35.125
I went for My program.

21:36.583 --> 21:39.709
We had a women's conference.

21:41.083 --> 21:42.500
So I don't know why,

21:43.333 --> 21:46.625
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

21:47.709 --> 21:50.125
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

21:50.959 --> 21:55.834
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.083
They put Me in the car.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.250
They put My luggage there

22:00.417 --> 22:02.208
and they said, "We have to directly

22:02.417 --> 22:05.000
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

22:05.875 --> 22:09.875
I went there and in this short time,

22:10.166 --> 22:13.250
these boys were really so attached to Me.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.166
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

22:17.792 --> 22:18.917
- can't believe it -

22:19.208 --> 22:22.834
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

22:24.250 --> 22:27.208
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

22:27.458 --> 22:28.667
They brought two cars -

22:30.000 --> 22:32.709
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

22:33.500 --> 22:38.458
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.625
But I said, "What will you do?"

22:41.083 --> 22:43.333
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

22:43.750 --> 22:44.875
Can you imagine?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.542
They were no relation of mine.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.667
I've never seen them before.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.500
So one of them said,

22:52.709 --> 22:56.208
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

22:56.500 --> 22:58.291
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

22:58.709 --> 23:00.959
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

23:02.917 --> 23:05.166
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

23:05.375 --> 23:07.959
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.333
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

23:10.458 --> 23:14.083
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

23:14.375 --> 23:15.375
I tell you,

23:15.959 --> 23:17.583
tears came into my eyes.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.208
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

23:21.625 --> 23:23.750
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

23:23.959 --> 23:26.208
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

23:27.250 --> 23:31.500
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

23:32.166 --> 23:36.083
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.083
And they carried My Wheelchair

23:40.333 --> 23:43.500
up three storeys with their hands.

23:44.041 --> 23:45.667
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

23:45.792 --> 23:47.792
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

23:47.917 --> 23:49.458
"We want You to come."

23:50.792 --> 23:51.625
I said, "Why?"

23:52.458 --> 23:54.417
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

23:54.917 --> 23:57.208
I don't know what made them think like that.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.250
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

24:00.625 --> 24:02.709
With love, you get enlightened.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.667
With love, you get understanding.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.667
And such deep love exists within you.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.291
Now the politicians will come

24:13.417 --> 24:14.834
and tell you a story.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.041
Then somebody else will tell you,

24:17.291 --> 24:18.959
"Come and fight" and all that.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.083
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

24:23.792 --> 24:27.667
But now, now they're changing.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.917
All this world has to change

24:31.417 --> 24:33.333
because it has suffered a lot.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.542
This is no religion.

24:37.041 --> 24:40.291
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

24:41.083 --> 24:42.291
It is not.

24:42.542 --> 24:46.291
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

24:46.750 --> 24:48.208
is the worst thing.

24:49.083 --> 24:52.750
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

24:53.792 --> 24:58.542
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.750
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.083
I can't understand, stupid people.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.208
They have done so many laws

25:12.000 --> 25:15.375
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

25:16.083 --> 25:20.250
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

25:21.834 --> 25:24.333
They have no sense of pure love.

25:26.417 --> 25:29.333
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

25:29.583 --> 25:33.041
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

25:33.500 --> 25:35.667
I should say the 'property'.

25:36.667 --> 25:41.375
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

25:42.959 --> 25:48.166
It's all something very, very wretched.

25:48.417 --> 25:51.208
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.542
Even the animals are not like that,

25:54.667 --> 25:57.500
but human beings can go to any extreme.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.959
The whole wealth of beauty,

26:01.166 --> 26:03.417
the whole wealth of creativity,

26:04.041 --> 26:07.250
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

26:07.500 --> 26:11.083
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

26:13.041 --> 26:15.250
If you are a fighting cock,

26:16.291 --> 26:20.375
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

26:21.417 --> 26:23.000
They will fight others

26:23.208 --> 26:25.875
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

26:26.625 --> 26:29.208
They might say, "We must fight." All right,  fight.

26:29.417 --> 26:32.750
But then they fight among themselves also.

26:32.959 --> 26:36.750
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

26:37.542 --> 26:41.458
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.667
Why take the name of religion?

26:44.834 --> 26:46.583
What the religion has done?

26:47.291 --> 26:49.333
How could the religion teach you such a

26:49.542 --> 26:52.917
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

26:55.208 --> 26:58.750
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

26:58.959 --> 27:05.417
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.083
They say it is Kali Yuga.

27:09.041 --> 27:10.542
I can't understand.

27:11.625 --> 27:13.750
How can you lose the power to love?

27:14.166 --> 27:16.709
That's what Christ has talked about.

27:17.250 --> 27:19.709
He's talked about love very clearly.

27:20.875 --> 27:23.667
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

27:23.917 --> 27:25.709
Have you found anyone like that?

27:29.458 --> 27:31.250
You don't find all such people.

27:32.083 --> 27:36.500
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.166
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

27:41.917 --> 27:45.750
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

27:46.750 --> 27:49.667
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

27:50.083 --> 27:53.500
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

27:53.709 --> 27:54.709
Nowhere.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.625
The reason is - I don't blame them

27:58.041 --> 28:00.041
- because they had no Realization.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.041
They didn't know their spirit.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.375
If you have no Realization,

28:05.875 --> 28:08.333
you cannot understand anything,

28:08.667 --> 28:12.834
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

28:14.500 --> 28:15.542
I mean,

28:16.375 --> 28:18.250
if you go to Germany,

28:19.959 --> 28:22.959
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

28:23.583 --> 28:27.125
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

28:27.792 --> 28:30.417
Even you go to Japan

28:30.709 --> 28:33.709
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

28:34.959 --> 28:36.208
this - my goodness,

28:36.917 --> 28:39.583
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

28:39.834 --> 28:43.333
I said,  "How could human beings be that cruel?"

28:45.250 --> 28:46.542
Horrible!

28:47.291 --> 28:48.583
I mean now the days have come that

28:48.792 --> 28:50.291
they're killing their own children.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.542
Extreme is this.

28:53.709 --> 28:55.959
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

28:56.792 --> 29:00.375
in which you love all human beings

29:01.500 --> 29:04.041
because they're human beings.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.750
They're born with you in this time.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.500
You have to help each other

29:10.917 --> 29:12.333
and love each other.

29:13.834 --> 29:15.000
This is the main thing.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.125
If you can develop this,

29:17.750 --> 29:20.000
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

29:20.542 --> 29:23.959
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.917
Divine will help you

29:27.333 --> 29:29.709
and take you out of all troubles

29:30.166 --> 29:33.875
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

29:34.375 --> 29:38.083
if you are a loving personality.

29:38.667 --> 29:41.375
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

29:41.625 --> 29:42.792
It didn't exist (like this before.)

29:43.208 --> 29:47.583
Now, if you are a loving person,

29:48.458 --> 29:51.583
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

29:52.125 --> 29:54.166
to sort out your problems,

29:54.750 --> 29:56.750
to punish those who are troubling you.

29:56.959 --> 29:59.417
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.834
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

30:03.041 --> 30:04.500
I don't fight. I don't shout.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.041
Automatically, it works.

30:08.917 --> 30:11.291
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.875
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

30:19.041 --> 30:22.542
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

30:23.542 --> 30:28.542
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

30:28.792 --> 30:29.750
take it from Me.

30:30.458 --> 30:32.291
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.709
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.458
People are horrible. This is that.

30:37.750 --> 30:40.041
But there's one thing

30:40.458 --> 30:45.875
that this Divine has become very alert.

30:46.041 --> 30:47.500
It was never that alert.

30:48.583 --> 30:50.500
If Christ was born at this time,

30:50.750 --> 30:52.583
He could not have been crucified.

30:55.792 --> 31:00.083
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.208
That's a very big blessing for us.

31:03.542 --> 31:05.291
Nobody can be tortured.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.917
Nobody can be troubled.

31:08.959 --> 31:12.375
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

31:13.375 --> 31:15.417
You have to have a good character

31:16.333 --> 31:20.583
and you have to have a very loving personality.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.083
That's all.

31:22.458 --> 31:24.625
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.291
You'll get the blessings

31:27.959 --> 31:29.667
because [of] you're loving personality.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.583
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

31:33.125 --> 31:35.542
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

31:36.166 --> 31:38.125
I'm not surprised because I know

31:38.417 --> 31:41.625
the Divine has become extremely alert

31:42.208 --> 31:45.458
towards human beings who are good and nice.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.166
It will look after.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.709
It will support. It will do everything.

31:50.834 --> 31:54.542
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.375
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

31:57.667 --> 32:01.083
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

32:01.291 --> 32:03.208
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.709
Take it from Me.

32:05.458 --> 32:08.500
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

32:09.166 --> 32:11.750
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

32:11.917 --> 32:15.083
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

32:15.500 --> 32:17.166
how they have been supported,

32:17.667 --> 32:19.417
how they have been helped.

32:20.125 --> 32:24.041
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

32:28.333 --> 32:32.917
So we have to trust in ourselves

32:33.875 --> 32:37.208
and we have to really love people.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.834
We should be humble and love.

32:41.375 --> 32:45.333
All this love will help you all your life.

32:46.041 --> 32:48.750
This is the message of Christ.

32:49.041 --> 32:51.542
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

32:52.000 --> 32:53.166
How lovingly He said,

32:53.333 --> 32:56.208
"But they don't know what they're doing."

32:57.041 --> 32:59.166
Very lovingly He pleads

32:59.417 --> 33:02.208
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

33:02.500 --> 33:04.542
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

33:05.083 --> 33:07.208
because they don't know what they are doing."

33:07.792 --> 33:11.083
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

33:11.417 --> 33:17.625
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

33:18.083 --> 33:20.625
we have to worship that character within us,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.083
that we are also loving people.

33:23.417 --> 33:24.583
We love each other.

33:24.959 --> 33:28.542
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

33:28.875 --> 33:31.834
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

33:32.041 --> 33:36.041
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.375
My blessings to you is this -

33:39.583 --> 33:44.250
on this day may God give you lots of love,

33:45.083 --> 33:48.041
and loving capacity within you,

33:48.667 --> 33:50.333
that you should have,

33:50.625 --> 33:53.250
which will change your life completely

33:53.583 --> 33:56.709
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

33:57.291 --> 33:59.834
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

34:00.834 --> 34:04.208
You can do marvels and miracles

34:04.917 --> 34:09.208
if you have developed the understanding of love.

34:10.709 --> 34:12.208
May God bless you
