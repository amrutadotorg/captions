1
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:19,578
Today we have decided to have Shri Krishna
Puja in the land of Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:32,083
Though this is the land of Shri Krishna,

3
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:38,480
people ask Me why the people are not
spiritual.

4
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:47,122
How is it they get entangled into different
types of seekings

5
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:51,357
which are not leading to truth?

6
00:00:51,558 --> 00:01:00,223
Why is it the people in America are not
so alert as to recognize

7
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:05,907
what is the truth and what they have
to find?

8
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:14,009
Shri Krishna’s time was, as you know,

9
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:21,956
at least two thousand after Shri Rama.

10
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:28,077
And Shri Rama created lots of disciplines

11
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:37,915
for human beings to follow in the path
of their ascent.

12
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:42,268
According to the time everything works out.

13
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:51,229
So people were extremely rigid,
disciplined,

14
00:01:51,430 --> 00:02:05,621
and it so happened that people lost
the touch with the truth.

15
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:15,374
They would leave their wives, ill-treat
their wives,

16
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:22,598
do all kinds of things in the name
of Shri Rama;

17
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:29,847
because always human beings take
to something which is not right.

18
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:36,662
The another side they never saw, how
Rama went after Sitaji to find Her,

19
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:48,306
and He fought the horrible rakshasa Ravana
to get back His wife.

20
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:52,805
So the other side people never see.

21
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:56,852
Only this side they saw that He was very
strict with His wife,

22
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:02,924
and if the wife stayed over in some
function, He got so angry,

23
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:09,146
and He shouted at Her and He threw Her out,
and all those things.

24
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:19,762
That is how Shri Krishna came in.

25
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:27,340
Always incarnations come one after another
to correct themselves only.

26
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:33,854
When Shri Krishna found that it is
on the other side, of ego –

27
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,739
that men thought they were very powerful
people

28
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,122
and they could do whatever they liked,

29
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:43,110
and they had all the power to judge their
wives –

30
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:49,985
so Shri Krishna came with a new diversion,

31
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:56,690
or I should say, from a new idea about
life.

32
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:09,569
He talked of freedom, He talked
of abandonment,

33
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:15,903
and He talked that life is for enjoyment.

34
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:22,090
Radha was the source of joy.

35
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:27,008
“Ra” is energy, “dha” means the one who
sustains energy.

36
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,646
She was the source of joy,

37
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:40,402
and His idea was, to enjoy life is the best
way to live.

38
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:46,226
And that’s why He said that you should play
Holi,

39
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:50,596
you should enjoy yourselves, you must have
Raas,

40
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:58,629
by which you enjoy group dancing and
freedom.

41
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,531
So people thought that’s the way one has
to live -

42
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:13,908
is to be absolutely free, live as you like,
specially in America.

43
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:19,555
They thought that to enjoy life is
complete abandonment:

44
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:24,538
no discipline, no bindings,

45
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:29,684
you can divorce your wife eight times and
husbands ten times.

46
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:33,383
That sort of a life started long time back,

47
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:37,945
but it really prospered in America.

48
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:43,524
The prosperity of this kind of a culture
came to such a level

49
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:49,350
that now we don’t know what’s going
to happen to the family system,

50
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,712
to the joy part of it.

51
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:01,243
Again here people forgot the other side
of it.

52
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:08,990
Adi Shakti first created Shri Ganesh.

53
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:14,513
Shri Ganesh is the source of wisdom,

54
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:19,501
He’s the source of auspiciousness.

55
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:31,807
Through Him we understand auspiciousness.

56
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:38,260
And He is a child, He is an eternal child.

57
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:49,180
And this behavior of abandonment is
very destructive,

58
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:52,878
if there is no wisdom.

59
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:01,894
First thing was to establish wisdom within
ourselves.

60
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:10,069
But we start a theory or a kind of
a pattern of life

61
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,846
without thinking have we got the wisdom
or not?

62
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,130
Are we capable of following that pattern
of life

63
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:30,336
without any development of our wisdom?

64
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:39,027
But the worst was when the freedom became
the criteria of life,

65
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:46,235
people became extremely dominating and
egoistical.

66
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,327
The first answer always you will get it,
“What’s wrong?”

67
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:59,297
You ask them, “Why are you doing this?”
“What’s wrong?”

68
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:03,412
“I mean, it’s wrong because it is not
auspicious.”

69
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:13,055
“What’s auspiciousness is there?” –
absolutely like you can call them,

70
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:20,800
people without any brains, brainless
people.

71
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,677
“Brainless” means there is no wisdom.

72
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:30,948
What is the power of brain is wisdom.

73
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:51,793
So life started drifting into a destructive
pond, we should say, of no return.

74
00:08:52,065 --> 00:09:01,043
And every kind of filth was accepted
as a blessing,

75
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:08,453
and nobody would think that this is wrong,

76
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:13,004
this is not for human life.

77
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:17,299
Even the animals are all not like that.

78
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:29,843
Added to that came the stupidity
of drinking alcohol.

79
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:39,812
I don’t know how they discovered alcohol
long time back, long, long time back,

80
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:44,754
but they say it came out of the manthana

81
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:49,108
and out of the churning of the ocean

82
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:57,441
by the suras and asuras, by the rakshasas
and by the devas.

83
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,011
Must be some trick to get these rakshasas
drunk,

84
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:20,850
and to somehow or other manage to get the
kumbha of, the pitcher of amruta, ambrosia;

85
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:25,265
so that these rakshasas will be lost
drinking

86
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:32,812
and then the devas will get their due,

87
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:38,069
which was amruta, which was ambrosia.

88
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:47,082
That might be one of the reasons that
it was created out of the ocean,

89
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:53,026
or among all the fourteen things that came
out of the ocean.

90
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:08,092
So kind of a oppositions, opposite quality
of things were created.

91
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:13,461
Another thing they created were
prostitutes.

92
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:20,548
One may ask why prostitutes came out
of that manthana –

93
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:25,551
because now you have freedom.

94
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:30,509
You are given freedom to choose,

95
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:38,834
and so you must have full vision

96
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:48,770
whether to choose an auspicious life,
a holy life, a divine life,

97
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:53,491
or to choose destructive life.

98
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:56,683
This opposition came forward

99
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:02,274
because your freedom had to be respected,

100
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,605
that was very important.

101
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:09,757
In the growth of human awareness it was
very important

102
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,701
to respect the freedom of human beings.

103
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:19,993
Because animals, if you see, they have
no freedom:

104
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:26,357
a snake will be a snake, scorpion will be
a scorpion,

105
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:29,369
lion will be a lion.

106
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:36,360
They live with their own qualities, gunas;

107
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:43,407
you cannot make them do something that
other animals are doing.

108
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:49,731
We have passed through all these different
animal yonis

109
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:55,436
and now we are human beings, and now we
have freedom.

110
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:59,304
Now why freedom, one may ask – because
these days they ask

111
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:05,088
such questions for everything you say –
why freedom needed?

112
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:10,793
Like I always told you before that
in the school they teach you

113
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:16,517
two plus two is four, and you have
to remember it.

114
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:22,177
But when you grow and when you go
to college,

115
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:28,457
you are supposed to have freedom
to understand everything yourself.

116
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:39,618
In the same manner, your awareness was
to be brought to that level

117
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:46,365
that you could use your freedom wisely.

118
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:52,512
Now, you have to have temptations.

119
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:59,709
How can you judge a person whether he is
blind or not blind?

120
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:07,370
Supposing you ask a blind person, “Is this
a flower?”

121
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:12,010
He might feel it, say, “No, no, it’s
a bee.”

122
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:17,284
So he has to have his eyes to see,

123
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:23,785
and once you give him the eyes he goes
amok.

124
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:29,582
He doesn’t know what to do, what is good
for him.

125
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:37,942
So he chose all that was not at all good
for him,

126
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:44,790
auspicious for him, and detrimental for his
growth.

127
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:49,867
So the drinking started, and with drinking

128
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:55,649
you don’t know how we get abandoned.

129
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:03,244
I have heard people, that they lose their
sense of relationship with brothers,

130
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:08,711
sisters, mothers, everything, if you get
drunk.

131
00:15:08,912 --> 00:15:12,096
So many drunkards have told Me this.

132
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:16,427
That is why in this country we have funny
type of relationships –

133
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:21,900
one can’t understand, how can it be?
But it is so.

134
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,174
By drinking, all these things have happened

135
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,744
that they don’t know who is your sister,

136
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:31,817
who is your wife, who is your mother.

137
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:39,521
In India also we have but different type
of thing,

138
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:43,438
that they will ill-treat their mother,
they’ll ill-treat their sister,

139
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,807
ill-treat their wives; the other way round
also.

140
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:52,729
But here they do not ill-treat,

141
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:59,625
they love, but in a very perverted manner.

142
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:04,391
You see the reaction in two countries.

143
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:08,377
So this grew up very much,

144
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:18,057
and today we see a country that is America
in a complete chaos.

145
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:35,131
So this freedom without any wisdom at all
growing,

146
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:43,632
starts creating a terrible ego.

147
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:52,956
When auspiciousness is given up then
Shri Ganesha sleeps

148
00:16:53,157 --> 00:17:02,651
and as Christ, who is the incarnation
of Shri Ganesha, also doesn’t bother.

149
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:07,735
So the rule of Christ is finished.

150
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:16,688
So what rules is the ego, this ego which
thinks it is free.

151
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:26,963
It doesn’t know it is bound by all kinds
of enemies of very horrible types.

152
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:30,320
At the time of Shri Krishna He said

153
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:35,805
that the worst enemy human beings have is
anger,

154
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,730
but I think in modern times the worst enemy

155
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:46,293
human beings have is greed and jealousy.

156
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:51,589
Greed has no meaning these days. I mean,
what do you say to a person

157
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:58,811
who has three thousand shoes – I mean,
pairs of shoes?

158
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,952
Must be mad!

159
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:06,956
There are all sorts of things, you know,
in greed you see these days.

160
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:12,876
You don’t know how people are really
behaving.

161
00:18:13,077 --> 00:18:15,259
No one can explain.

162
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:22,563
I know of someone who has five thousand
dogs.

163
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:29,369
What is she doing with those dogs I don’t
know, but she has.

164
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:42,408
Like all countries, even in America
I think it’s much worse, much worse.

165
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:47,548
Now you may call it anything, consumerism
or anything like that,

166
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:51,313
or your economics which is, I think, very
faulty,

167
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:56,466
it doesn’t understand human beings –
whatever it may be,

168
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:59,932
it can never bring benevolence,

169
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:05,565
neither to the person who thinks he is
rich,

170
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:13,283
or to the people whom he is exploiting.

171
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,912
As far as spirituality is concerned,

172
00:19:19,113 --> 00:19:25,833
they are all away from the realm
of divinity.

173
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:29,154
Now the mind starts working with ego.

174
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:33,102
Ego takes over like a computer,

175
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:36,240
and it starts suggesting ways and methods

176
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:41,738
by which how much money you can earn.

177
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:45,338
So when you start earning money,

178
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:50,390
then again the same Ego Mister tells you

179
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:55,190
how to destroy yourself with this money.

180
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:59,678
They do all kinds of things when they have
money.

181
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:04,286
I mean, that money is not a Lakshmi prasad;

182
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:08,182
it is some sort of a money that becomes
like a rakshasa

183
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:12,286
or a devil and which devours you.

184
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:17,561
It takes you to all kinds of wrong places.

185
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:23,920
It takes you to such horrible theories

186
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:29,233
that nobody would accept such theories.

187
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:35,184
This ego makes you feel that – ah, yes,
you are perfect,

188
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:40,777
you know everything, whatever you are doing
is the best.

189
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:45,171
But with all that doing, what happens?

190
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:50,360
You become restless, you cannot sleep.

191
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:58,623
Now with the problem here is that people
have this so-called tension, stress.

192
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:02,821
In our young age we never heard of
this word, what is tension, stress is.

193
00:21:03,021 --> 00:21:07,181
Even now in India very few people know
about it.

194
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:12,277
Because you yourself, you are destroying
yourself.

195
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:17,070
So with this money, say, you want to entice
some woman –

196
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,716
take a very low-level thing.

197
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:23,484
Then you’ll run after her, give her this,
give her that,

198
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:28,480
and spend all your money till you become
bankrupt.

199
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:33,539
And then you’ll start sitting and crying.

200
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:36,583
And this is a common story.

201
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,951
I don’t know why don’t they make films
like this,

202
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:44,941
to show actually what happens to a person
who runs after money,

203
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:47,371
and he goes on then spending that money.

204
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,972
He doesn’t know what to do, you see; money
also eats him, I think.

205
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:59,394
On the other side we have people who are
extremely miserly.

206
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:09,069
So all their – with the money only, they
become so much greedy

207
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,732
that they keep their money in seven locks
and keys.

208
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:19,905
Now, they see in the world there are people
who are suffering so much,

209
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:23,204
who have so much problem.

210
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:28,702
Why not spend some money on them?

211
00:22:29,162 --> 00:22:36,585
So then there are agents come up, like
our Swiss bank.

212
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:46,041
Swiss bank is the outcome of our greed,
completely our greed;

213
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:48,991
because we have so much money we don’t
know what to do,

214
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,946
so we put it in the Swiss bank.

215
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:55,753
Swiss bank says, “All right, we’ll look
after it.”

216
00:22:55,954 --> 00:23:00,504
Because we are greedy as well as we are
miserly.

217
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:06,088
I mean, miserly people are another
crackpots, I should say, the way they live.

218
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,888
But also the people who have money are
really crackpots.

219
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:18,857
They have no sense of self-respect, neither
self-esteem.

220
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:26,713
Now imagine eighty, ninety-year-old women
going for a shake dance, as I told you.

221
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:30,583
Because they have money they think they
should do this,

222
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,674
competing with the young people, because
they have money.

223
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:41,285
If they have money, if they get it without
any, I should say,

224
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:46,753
cheating or without deceiving someone,
if it’s a real good money

225
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:55,245
they should give it to some good cause
and try to propagate goodness.

226
00:23:55,446 --> 00:24:00,671
But money itself seems to be something
very bad, like poison,

227
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:09,434
because either this money makes you mad
how to spend it,

228
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:13,488
or mad how to save it.

229
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,548
As if you become a slave of this money
business,

230
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:24,906
and in that slavishness you go on drifting,
drifting, drifting.

231
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:33,365
I’ve seen people when they talk,

232
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,408
you don’t know why they talk like that,
you know.

233
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,178
Then you discover that they have a bank
account,

234
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:42,472
that’s why they are talking like that.

235
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:48,589
If you don’t have bank account then you
won’t talk like that.

236
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,765
I mean, more than that also.

237
00:24:51,966 --> 00:24:56,524
This country is overflowing with money,

238
00:24:56,725 --> 00:25:00,694
with all kinds of money transactions,

239
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:03,536
permutations and combinations and this
and that,

240
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:10,840
and what you can do with money – because
Shri Krishna is Kubera.

241
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:17,355
He is the Deity, or we can say He is
the God of wealth.

242
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:24,929
But at the same time, He is a very
mischievous God.

243
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:30,363
You can see clearly: this is supposed to be
Shri Krishna’s country

244
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:34,183
which is overflowing with money.

245
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:38,831
At the same time you find horrible things
happening,

246
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:40,777
worst in the whole world.

247
00:25:40,978 --> 00:25:43,994
I mean, no one can beat Americans, they
say,

248
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:58,514
in stupidity, in vulgarity, indecency,
exploitation.

249
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:08,074
So this is the curse of money on human
beings, which is to be understood,

250
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:17,230
that freedom without wisdom is the most
dangerous thing to use.

251
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:23,052
It is better not to be free if you have
no wisdom,

252
00:26:23,253 --> 00:26:26,579
because God knows what you will do

253
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,202
if you have freedom and no wisdom.

254
00:26:30,403 --> 00:26:37,869
I’ve seen here, heard about women who are
killing their children.

255
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:44,082
I mean, nowhere you will find such a thing
like that, killing small children.

256
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:50,163
Now how this money makes you so dry

257
00:26:50,364 --> 00:27:02,921
that you have no, I would say, no love,
no feeling.

258
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:08,237
Just for killing’s sake also, people kill
here.

259
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:19,714
Now there are – there’s another thing that
this money does:

260
00:27:19,915 --> 00:27:24,341
it creates a disparity.

261
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:31,389
There are some who are very rich,
there are some who are very poor.

262
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:39,498
So those who are very poor are against
those who are very rich.

263
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:45,351
They can’t understand why should these
people have so much money,

264
00:27:45,552 --> 00:27:48,127
so they think it’s a matter of right

265
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:53,596
to snatch all that money from them and use
it for themselves.

266
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:58,115
But the same money can destroy them also.

267
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:05,446
So snatching that money with violence or
grabbing it

268
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:10,159
is not going to give you any blessings.

269
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:18,741
So what is the purpose of wealth?

270
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:26,030
That is very important for people who
worship Shri Krishna to know.

271
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:32,650
In Shri Krishna’s life, He saw that
the women

272
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:39,134
who were creating buttermilk and butter

273
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:44,989
were carrying all that all the way
to Mathura,

274
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:50,192
where in Mathura this horrible King Kamsa
was reigning.

275
00:28:50,393 --> 00:28:55,748
And they used to give to all the soldiers
there.

276
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:59,122
He didn’t want them to do that.

277
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,642
Because they would fetch much more money,

278
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:09,372
they would be paid much more, so these
women were greedy about it.

279
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:14,257
Instead of giving them to their own
children, to their own families,

280
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:20,468
they used to collect all that and take
to Mathura.

281
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:28,851
From very childhood Shri Krishna used
to throw stones at those pitchers

282
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:34,366
and break their pitchers, because he didn’t
want

283
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:44,395
that to go all the way to Mathura to feed
those horrible soldiers.

284
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:49,739
This is what it is we have to learn,

285
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,707
that if we have, say, surplus money or
something,

286
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:59,767
you have to think what you can do with it

287
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:12,636
and what joy it can bring, by sharing with
right type of people.

288
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:17,121
Not in the pubs, no, no, I don’t mean that,

289
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:24,537
but sharing it for their needs and what
they want.

290
00:30:24,738 --> 00:30:32,382
Actually a disciple of Shri Krishna should
be a self-satisfied person.

291
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:39,524
Look at His life, how self-satisfied He
was.

292
00:30:39,786 --> 00:30:51,926
Every episode about Him talks of His
complete oneness with Himself.

293
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:58,088
For example, when Arjuna asked Him that

294
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,919
“Why don’t You join us Pandavas to fight
with us?”

295
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,171
In modern times in the competitive life,
you see, if you see those races,

296
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:15,664
they’re so anxious to win, to have
the higher position.

297
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:22,980
Then all the big, big politicians are
trying

298
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:29,877
to bring down other politicians, to have
their own power.

299
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:36,399
But what did Shri Krishna say, that “I will
be your charioteer.

300
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:45,339
I’ll drive your chariot, but I will not
lift My weapon against anyone.”

301
00:31:45,824 --> 00:31:50,178
We can’t think of anyone like that today.

302
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:54,341
See, people will never say that,
“All right,

303
00:31:54,542 --> 00:32:00,536
I will stay down and you’ll be
on the throne.”

304
00:32:00,737 --> 00:32:04,119
Very difficult even to see one person

305
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,606
who could behave like Shri Krishna.

306
00:32:07,807 --> 00:32:17,148
Because whether He is a charioteer or He
is the one who was Arjuna,

307
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:26,220
or He was the captain of the whole thing,
He knew what He was.

308
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:31,918
What was the need for Him to become this
or that, and that?

309
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:37,526
But these days, you see, to become
something is such a struggle going on.

310
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:41,842
Someone wants to be, say, the prime
minister –

311
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,638
that’s the highest, I think, I don’t know.

312
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:50,168
But then some want to dislodge the prime
minister.

313
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,698
Then you start from the peon upward,

314
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:57,366
everybody wants something higher, higher,
higher, higher.

315
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:01,695
This is another very subtle type of greed

316
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:08,394
which is working out in our minds.

317
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:14,495
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen that
the leaders –

318
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,292
now are settled down of course, much
better –

319
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:22,258
but used to be such a terrible fight
for leadership.

320
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:27,136
It’s all a myth, actual myth, but they used
to fight.

321
00:33:27,337 --> 00:33:31,481
And they would write letters after letters.
There were groups:

322
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:34,957
one group would write against another
group,

323
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:37,309
another group would write against this
group,

324
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:46,537
and I used to just laugh, because there’s
no truth in it.

325
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:50,167
Leadership is no truth, it’s just a joke.

326
00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:54,071
But even if I told them it’s a joke, they
would not understand

327
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:59,967
it’s a joke and not to be that serious,
and to fight about it.

328
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:06,698
Gradually it’s settled down normally –
better, much better, it’s not so much bad.

329
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:11,028
But that is what is there, this greed.

330
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:14,143
That was the mistake, I think, of Shri
Krishna,

331
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:20,524
that instead of anger He should have put
greed as the worst thing.

332
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:26,362
Actually, you see, these incarnations don’t
know much about human beings,

333
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:28,890
and they would not know how far they will
be going –

334
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:30,961
same happens to Me.

335
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:37,096
But they are absolutely unaware that
what these human beings are,

336
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:44,281
what you tell them, what they will make
out of it.

337
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,678
Their brains are so sharp

338
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,532
that they’ll pick up whatever is wrong
for them,

339
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:57,691
and never see whatever is right for them.

340
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:02,830
Shri Rama tried something – it was of no
use.

341
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:06,865
Shri Krishna tried something – it was of no
use.

342
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:11,816
So we come to Shri Jesus Christ.

343
00:35:12,017 --> 00:35:19,961
Nowadays the people who are something
else are ardent disciples of Christ.

344
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:30,829
They have no wisdom of any kind.

345
00:35:33,143 --> 00:35:37,280
Like mad they are going about.

346
00:35:37,481 --> 00:35:39,587
You read there about their organizations,

347
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:43,412
you read about things that they do,
you are amazed at it;

348
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:48,389
you see, how can they be disciples
of Christ?

349
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,790
In no way they have any right on Christ
to begin with,

350
00:35:55,991 --> 00:36:01,280
because they don’t know anything about
Christ.

351
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:06,032
First to know and then to imbibe His
qualities

352
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:15,559
are something very, very, I should say,
impossible thing it is these days.

353
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:20,768
Some would say, “Why was He born in
a poor family?

354
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:26,163
He was born in a poor family – He should
have been born to Mr. Ford.”

355
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:31,121
Some say – I mean, you see, finding faults
and criticizing

356
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:35,308
is the only thing left to us now

357
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:39,606
because you can’t do anything else, that’s
why.

358
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:44,452
Then they would say, “Why did He get
himself crucified?”

359
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:47,331
He didn’t crucify you. He should have
crucified you,

360
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:52,716
but actually He crucified himself, that was
His mistake.

361
00:36:53,799 --> 00:37:01,477
It is also very difficult for human beings
to understand incarnations,

362
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:05,140
because they are in juxtaposition.

363
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:12,030
They are very different things, so human
beings can’t understand.

364
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:15,715
Now they are there to lead them,

365
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:19,673
they are there to tell them what is to be
done;

366
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:27,595
but the way they understand, you see, it’s
just absurd.

367
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:36,119
For example, you know in Chicago I met
the head of the Hare Rama fellow.

368
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:40,527
Another puzzle he was to Me, really,

369
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:43,573
because he came in a very thin dhoti

370
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:48,388
and it was so very cold, and he was
shivering before Me.

371
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:52,731
So I said, “Sir, why are you wearing such
a thin dhoti?

372
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:55,853
You are shivering, I am very sorry.”

373
00:37:56,054 --> 00:38:01,685
He said, “Why? My guru has told me
that I should have a thin dhoti.”

374
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:06,166
“Why?” “To go to heaven, to achieve my
ascent.”

375
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,447
I said, “Really? He told you like that?

376
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:12,268
But Shri Krishna never wore a thin dhoti.”

377
00:38:12,469 --> 00:38:14,178
“But I am not Shri Krishna,” he said –

378
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:20,499
see how the human mind tries to avoid.

379
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:31,241
So now, then he had shaved his head and
had a big pony-tail behind.

380
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,292
I asked him, “Why have you shaved your
head?”

381
00:38:34,493 --> 00:38:38,072
So he said, “Because my guru told me that
you have to shave your head

382
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:41,234
if you have to go to heaven.”

383
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:45,279
So I said, “But Shri Krishna did not shave
His head.”

384
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,440
“No, no, but He was incarnation. I have
to shave my head

385
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:52,984
so I have to go to heaven.”

386
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:59,454
So I told him, “See, Kabira has said that,

387
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:09,895
‘These sheep are shaven and shorn every
year twice.

388
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:17,598
And if they all go to heaven where will be
a place left for you?’ ”

389
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:20,419
So he never understood Me. He got very
angry with Me,

390
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,939
and he said to Me, “Mother, You are talking
ill about my guru.”

391
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,300
I said, “I am not talking ill. I am your
Mother, I am just asking Me

392
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:33,218
that what’s the use of wearing this thin
dhoti, that’s all.

393
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:38,510
A Mother has a right to ask.” He got very
angry, he went away.

394
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:43,620
And he’s the head of these Hare Ramas!

395
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:55,152
So to understand the incarnation also
you have to be a realized soul,

396
00:39:55,353 --> 00:40:02,560
otherwise you cannot, because they look
very absurd.

397
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:10,457
Without asking any questions if you can
become a realized soul –

398
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:15,144
if you ask questions it’s one degree less –

399
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:22,810
without questioning if you get your
realization, without any questions,

400
00:40:23,011 --> 00:40:26,179
then you have the highest marks.

401
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,963
But if you, after questioning and this
thing and that thing,

402
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:36,984
then you have less marks, because your
mind is very active,

403
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:41,330
and the person whose mind is active

404
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:46,772
cannot achieve something beyond the mind.

405
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:50,061
You have to achieve it beyond the mind.

406
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:55,141
This is one thing at least if you all
understand,

407
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:59,454
I think My work is done.

408
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,400
All tricks tried by Shri Krishna,

409
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:06,786
all disciplines put by Shri Rama,

410
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:11,569
all the gurus who tried their level best
to tell you what to do,

411
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:23,748
is only to make you a yogi by taking you
beyond the mind.

412
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,303
And then what happens?

413
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:34,854
Then you are in connection with this
all-pervading Power

414
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:38,597
which is looking after you, which protects
you, which helps you;

415
00:41:38,798 --> 00:41:50,454
in every way you are absolutely in charge
of this Paramachaitanya.

416
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:54,893
Now supposing I do not take the citizenship
of America –

417
00:41:55,094 --> 00:41:59,007
of course I may never take, but supposing.

418
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:04,189
Then this government is not in charge
of Me.

419
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:12,022
But if I take, of course they’ll tax Me, do
all kinds of things, doesn’t matter,

420
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:16,347
but at least they’ll be in charge.

421
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,050
But this Paramchaitanya when it takes
over,

422
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:26,925
it is love, is absolute love:

423
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:35,452
love which thinks, understands,
coordinates, cooperates, works,

424
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:40,539
and extremely sensitive.

425
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:49,755
It works – I’m sometimes so surprised
the way it works,

426
00:42:51,114 --> 00:42:57,216
without fail, without making any mistakes.

427
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:03,373
You don’t have to even tell, because you
are there.

428
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:10,570
But to believe that we are there also
is a difficult task.

429
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:19,753
With all the experiences you should believe
that you are there,

430
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:23,615
but that is also quite a difficult task.

431
00:43:23,816 --> 00:43:27,757
So when we say they’re established Sahaja
yogis

432
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:35,256
then what we mean is this, that they are
completely one,

433
00:43:35,486 --> 00:43:43,368
under complete charge of Paramachaitanya.

434
00:43:43,983 --> 00:43:47,269
That’s what we have to be.

435
00:43:47,914 --> 00:43:53,082
If you want to save this country, you have
to be that.

436
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:56,403
No argument, no explanation, nothing;

437
00:43:56,604 --> 00:44:01,368
no fighting, no strikes, nothing.

438
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:05,214
No placards is needed.

439
00:44:05,415 --> 00:44:11,278
You are the ones who will advertise Sahaja
Yoga.

440
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:16,619
Every one of you should understand

441
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:23,011
that your life is very important at this
juncture.

442
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:30,121
And you have to become that special person

443
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:37,540
who reflects reality through the divine
love.

444
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,373
May God bless you.
