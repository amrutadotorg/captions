00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:44,084
Today we are celebrating the great event

2
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:49,354
of the resurrection of Christ.

3
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:58,150
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

4
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:08,736
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

5
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:35,791
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

6
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:47,158
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

7
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:58,217
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

8
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:03,862
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

9
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:14,373
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

10
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:24,421
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

11
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:33,333
Of course people knew in India about it,

12
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:39,555
very few of them, very, very few of them,

13
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:49,112
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

14
00:05:52,434 --> 00:06:03,720
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

15
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:09,178
 and She gives you the second birth.

16
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:23,889
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

17
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:31,020
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

18
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:37,851
but people are given great ideas about it

19
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:50,423
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

20
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,881
It is the greatest happening for you,

21
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:01,040
 is the greatest event of your life,

22
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:10,204
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

23
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:18,545
All this because also because you desired for it.

24
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:33,624
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

25
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:45,605
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

26
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:50,233
That's already done by you.

27
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:57,325
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

28
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:03,503
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

29
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:13,974
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

30
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:22,007
You don't have to do anything about it,

31
00:08:22,157 --> 00:08:28,763
 it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

32
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:38,232
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

33
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:43,840
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

34
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:47,456
 that how can you save these people?

35
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:55,241
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

36
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:06,890
One has to understand that this Koran was written

37
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:12,437
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

38
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,714
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

39
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:29,786
 just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

40
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:41,811
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

41
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:49,557
 and was managed by a person who was not such a great

42
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:55,375
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

43
00:09:55,974 --> 00:10:03,902
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

44
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:11,090
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

45
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:17,699
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

46
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,673
 I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

47
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:30,883
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

48
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:34,078
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

49
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:37,135
In India we had the same problem.

50
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:42,047
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

51
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:45,904
 and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

52
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:52,891
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

53
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:58,838
About everything they can twist the words

54
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:07,861
 according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

55
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:12,826
This exactly what has happened.

56
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:20,652
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

57
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:34,920
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

58
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:45,830
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

59
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:52,177
 and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

60
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:56,752
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

61
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,776
All these things were in his mind

62
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:07,387
and so Thomas had to run away to India
 and John refused to write anything.

63
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:12,136
Because all such people take charge.

64
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,241
They become in charge.

65
00:12:14,424 --> 00:12:21,559
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

66
00:12:21,684 --> 00:12:25,474
They don't have the right to do it.

67
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:31,864
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

68
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:37,983
 wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

69
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:49,117
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

70
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,865
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

71
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,521
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

72
00:12:58,648 --> 00:13:03,044
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

73
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:10,462
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

74
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:16,318
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

75
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,316
Books and books were written.

76
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:22,126
They give big, big sermons.

77
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:26,139
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

78
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,205
even My father felt the same way.

79
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:36,316
Because all these books came much after,

80
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,597
the authors of these books.

81
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,385
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

82
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:48,858
They were not spiritual people.

83
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:55,963
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

84
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:04,869
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

85
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:11,950
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

86
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:20,476
 that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

87
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:30,737
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

88
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:34,570
who talked about reality, about the truth;

89
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:41,948
 though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

90
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:55,342
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

91
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:59,540
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

92
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:07,636
 to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

93
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:20,083
have now coming together, understanding that
 they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

94
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:29,536
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

95
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:39,787
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

96
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:45,647
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

97
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:49,263
Even among themselves there was no unity,

98
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:57,017
 and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

99
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:01,069
How can that be?

100
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:08,073
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

101
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:10,506
They were not collective.

102
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:15,412
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

103
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:22,923
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

104
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:31,771
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

105
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:38,445
 the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

106
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:44,614
They had no idea as to what truth is,

107
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:52,947
but still a seeker can never find consolation

108
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:56,129
with whatever exists.

109
00:16:56,597 --> 00:17:03,698
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

110
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:08,237
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

111
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,870
In seeking they get lost.

112
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:18,560
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

113
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:22,782
But they should see from their own lives.

114
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:30,039
They should see from their own attainment.

115
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:34,029
What have they achieved?

116
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,819
Have they got any experience?

117
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:48,033
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

118
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:56,607
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

119
00:17:57,194 --> 00:18:04,726
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

120
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:09,077
Now it’s said in the Koran,

121
00:18:09,332 --> 00:18:13,048
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

122
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,599
 they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

123
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:20,557
also many people don’t understand the difference.

124
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:24,957
One is when the resurrection time comes,

125
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:30,179
 and the another is when your destruction comes in.

126
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:36,579
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

127
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,930
 in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

128
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:48,742
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

129
00:18:48,888 --> 00:19:01,548
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

130
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:16,263
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

131
00:19:16,773 --> 00:19:19,313
otherwise they are not Muslims.

132
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,726
I would not call them Muslims.

133
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,388
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

134
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:31,834
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

135
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:37,983
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

136
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,722
He should feel the vibration.

137
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:55,409
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
 which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

138
00:19:55,748 --> 00:20:00,758
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

139
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:10,461
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

140
00:20:10,582 --> 00:20:14,259
through their vibrations on their hands,

141
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:20,703
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

142
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:27,155
 according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

143
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,036
They don't know.

144
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:32,466
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

145
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:36,517
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

146
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:41,601
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

147
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:48,935
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

148
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:53,838
 clearly, why did He ask people to go round

149
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,986
that black square stone?

150
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,421
What was the purpose of that?

151
00:21:01,647 --> 00:21:07,455
Why was that stone so important?

152
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:16,012
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

153
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:20,883
 but you can ask the question after all why?

154
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:23,120
That's also just a stone.

155
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:32,727
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

156
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:39,832
So many statues were there made of stone

157
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:47,039
 and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

158
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:51,323
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

159
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:57,611
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Meccashwar Shiva.

160
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:04,767
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

161
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:10,684
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

162
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:15,749
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

163
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:21,335
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Meccashwar Shiva

164
00:22:21,397 --> 00:22:32,900
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

165
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:41,607
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

166
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:44,684
Same thing with the Christianity.

167
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:51,860
Why today is a day they are talking so big
 about repentance

168
00:22:52,025 --> 00:22:59,772
 and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

169
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:10,824
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
 of virtues - so why did they do it?

170
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:17,741
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

171
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:22,470
Because they were not realized souls.

172
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,512
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

173
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:30,701
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

174
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:34,793
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

175
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:39,178
 or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,484
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

177
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:48,188
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

178
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,356
Why?

179
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:58,794
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

180
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:06,335
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

181
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:17,879
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:24,265
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

183
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:28,635
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

184
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:33,608
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

185
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:40,800
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

186
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:47,386
 wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

187
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:53,061
I met one man from Kashmir.

188
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,746
He said that, “Where is the peace?

189
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,202
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

190
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:06,532
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

191
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:11,960
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

192
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,899
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

193
00:25:18,806 --> 00:25:21,184
So I said, it's not Islam.

194
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:24,209
Islam means surrender.

195
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:27,847
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

196
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:31,932
We have no protection.”

197
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:36,390
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

198
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:40,573
 how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

199
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:46,417
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

200
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:54,417
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

201
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,074
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

202
00:25:58,427 --> 00:26:00,183
I have read them.

203
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:10,235
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

204
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:16,128
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

205
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:24,639
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

206
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:29,914
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

207
00:26:29,974 --> 00:26:33,294
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

208
00:26:33,556 --> 00:26:43,943
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

209
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:48,868
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

210
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:58,916
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

211
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:06,319
War is absolutely like madness.

212
00:27:06,562 --> 00:27:09,441
Even animals won't fight like that.

213
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:15,797
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

214
00:27:17,078 --> 00:27:23,065
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

215
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:33,456
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

216
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:44,206
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

217
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:50,363
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

218
00:27:50,504 --> 00:28:00,079
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
 kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

219
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:03,899
Kama means sexual perversion.

220
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,475
Kroda means anger.

221
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:09,997
Moha means attraction.

222
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:12,857
Mada means the pride.

223
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:17,838
Mathsarya means jealously.

224
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:29,531
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

225
00:28:29,846 --> 00:28:39,007
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

226
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:43,443
out of our reading, whatever it is,

227
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:49,387
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

228
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:57,008
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

229
00:28:57,112 --> 00:29:01,048
then you are on sound grounds.

230
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:05,363
You realize that you have found the truth

231
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:11,270
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

232
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,836
They just drop out.

233
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:23,144
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

234
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:27,836
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

235
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:36,894
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

236
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:43,870
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

237
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:48,661
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

238
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:57,753
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

239
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:02,639
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

240
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,441
Why should we offer an egg?

241
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:14,314
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

242
00:30:14,781 --> 00:30:18,639
It can become a small chick;

243
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:24,715
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

244
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:34,729
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

245
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:42,244
you can become a different person, a reformed person

246
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:48,026
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

247
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:50,346
Why do we give eggs?

248
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,409
People don't know.

249
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,580
I asked so many people.

250
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:59,554
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

251
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:03,886
They didn't know why they give eggs.

252
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:16,111
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

253
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:24,042
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

254
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:32,367
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

255
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:40,648
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

256
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:47,171
 and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

257
00:31:47,512 --> 00:31:57,331
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

258
00:31:57,753 --> 00:32:02,864
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

259
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:09,813
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

260
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:14,044
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

261
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:22,427
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

262
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:33,461
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

263
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:36,974
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

264
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:42,952
 and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

265
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:49,119
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

266
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,529
How clearly He does that.

267
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:57,967
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

268
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:02,758
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

269
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:08,804
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

270
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:22,786
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

271
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:28,957
All these things are not put together as
 I am telling you; separately,

272
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:37,431
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

273
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:48,743
 that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

274
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:58,313
 and that was blessed that
 “You will be the support of the whole universe.”

275
00:33:58,468 --> 00:34:02,317
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

276
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:12,568
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

277
00:34:13,066 --> 00:34:19,954
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

278
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:25,219
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

279
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:32,908
 it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

280
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:42,072
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

281
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:48,056
who is the support of the whole universe.

282
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:55,591
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

283
00:34:55,814 --> 00:35:02,562
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

284
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:06,258
it's the moral basis of human beings.

285
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:12,318
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

286
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,680
not all other nonsense that they have,

287
00:35:15,855 --> 00:35:24,537
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

288
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:30,489
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

289
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:39,237
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

290
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:49,221
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

291
00:35:49,542 --> 00:36:00,423
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

292
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:06,496
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

293
00:36:07,243 --> 00:36:14,133
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

294
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:19,518
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

295
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:24,581
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

296
00:36:24,627 --> 00:36:27,702
and how do you have your second birth?

297
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,055
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

298
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,032
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

299
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:42,845
 to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

300
00:36:43,218 --> 00:36:46,552
and that creates a problem for children.

301
00:36:46,577 --> 00:36:50,503
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

302
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:54,713
when they are being blessed by these priests,

303
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:59,480
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

304
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:02,007
It's very interesting.

305
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:06,361
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

306
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:11,122
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

307
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,834
Christ stood for morality.

308
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:25,554
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

309
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:35,439
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

310
00:37:37,237 --> 00:37:41,128
Morality is out of question.

311
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:48,364
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

312
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:54,865
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

313
00:37:55,068 --> 00:38:03,343
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

314
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:07,550
the support of the world as your leader -

315
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:15,296
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

316
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:27,263
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

317
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,269
Out of question!

318
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,501
He is the embodiment of morality.

319
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:44,690
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

320
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,667
 to come to churches, to the temples,

321
00:38:50,091 --> 00:38:55,591
and allow them to have immoral life?

322
00:38:56,012 --> 00:39:00,681
What is the atonement for such people?

323
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:12,836
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

324
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:22,185
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

325
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:30,474
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

326
00:39:32,307 --> 00:39:38,876
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

327
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:48,536
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

328
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:55,407
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

329
00:39:55,673 --> 00:40:02,714
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

330
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:11,337
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

331
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:15,292
 and cannot show your inner light also.

332
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:23,672
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

333
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:28,523
But people say that we have to accept

334
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:33,666
because if you have to have more people for your religion

335
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:40,142
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

336
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,078
And just think of it.

337
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:49,976
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

338
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:56,087
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

339
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:04,949
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

340
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:13,966
If your eyes are clean and pure,

341
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:23,592
 then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

342
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:32,057
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

343
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,933
 in completeness if your eyes are clean.

344
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,436
Just imagine.

345
00:41:40,046 --> 00:41:49,737
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

346
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:54,724
 how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

347
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,960
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

348
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:07,498
 because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

349
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:16,028
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

350
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:22,065
that you enjoy your morality

351
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:29,807
 and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

352
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:41,783
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
 that the eyes are not clean.

353
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:46,822
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

354
00:42:46,974 --> 00:42:49,244
How can that be?

355
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:51,685
How can you do that?

356
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:58,691
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

357
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:05,075
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

358
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:13,519
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

359
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:19,058
 cannot have lust and greed in them.

360
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:26,234
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

361
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:36,290
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

362
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:42,468
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

363
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:46,814
 I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

364
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:52,222
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

365
00:43:52,601 --> 00:44:00,382
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

366
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:06,141
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

367
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:11,792
 like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

368
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:20,157
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

369
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:28,415
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

370
00:44:28,629 --> 00:44:35,160
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

371
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:47,322
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

372
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:56,061
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

373
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,651
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

374
00:44:58,754 --> 00:45:04,451
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

375
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,628
They think as we are like that, the others are.

376
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:12,312
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

377
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:23,999
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

378
00:45:24,126 --> 00:45:32,857
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

379
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:40,978
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

380
00:45:41,337 --> 00:45:49,917
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

381
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:52,937
They don't know reality.

382
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:58,365
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

383
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,709
when they said about the four stages that you have.

384
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:07,576
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

385
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:12,433
you have to get into the reality.

386
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,486
Reality is what?

387
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,979
It’s not a perception.

388
00:46:19,162 --> 00:46:24,708
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

389
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:34,300
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

390
00:46:34,513 --> 00:46:43,557
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

391
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:49,742
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

392
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:55,028
This is real life and you don't indulge into

393
00:46:55,092 --> 00:47:02,373
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

394
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:03,944
No you don't do it.

395
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:09,152
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

396
00:47:09,228 --> 00:47:15,685
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

397
00:47:15,741 --> 00:47:23,151
 in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

398
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:35,420
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

399
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:46,724
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

400
00:47:47,256 --> 00:47:53,500
 will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

401
00:47:55,818 --> 00:48:00,719
It is absolutely part and parcel

402
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:06,231
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

403
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:12,395
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

404
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:15,218
Your hands are speaking - all right.

405
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:27,122
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

406
00:48:27,443 --> 00:48:31,693
Now you are free, because you have the light.

407
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:34,778
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

408
00:48:34,803 --> 00:48:43,793
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

409
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:49,241
 that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

410
00:48:49,368 --> 00:48:53,398
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

411
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:58,847
You want just do it, if something wrong
 you will not do; if you are doing it

412
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:04,916
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

413
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:11,510
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

414
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:17,081
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

415
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:24,573
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

416
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:30,219
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

417
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:39,430
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

418
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:46,849
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

419
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:50,407
 the other people into a better life?

420
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:53,617
That is what you are.

421
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:59,275
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

422
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:07,157
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

423
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:10,222
What you have to know what you are.

424
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:17,831
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

425
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:22,857
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

426
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:28,773
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

427
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:34,768
Purity is the basis of your existence.

428
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:41,757
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

429
00:50:42,029 --> 00:50:47,658
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

430
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:54,237
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

431
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:59,444
that is created out of beautiful minds,

432
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:04,345
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

433
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,155
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

434
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:15,737
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

435
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:19,361
As I love you, you will love you also.

436
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:26,263
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

437
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:35,698
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

438
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:41,841
and the love that you have flows,

439
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:48,602
 flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

440
00:51:48,919 --> 00:51:55,208
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

441
00:51:55,377 --> 00:52:00,403
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

442
00:52:00,602 --> 00:52:05,792
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

443
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:08,474
Why should we worry about them?

444
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:10,987
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

445
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:15,802
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

446
00:52:15,955 --> 00:52:25,657
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

447
00:52:25,724 --> 00:52:28,444
 it's not only a few people.

448
00:52:28,762 --> 00:52:33,485
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

449
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:38,196
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

450
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:46,118
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

451
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:54,943
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

452
00:52:55,347 --> 00:52:58,279
but you can't create that kind.

453
00:52:58,363 --> 00:53:08,386
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

454
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:14,899
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

455
00:53:15,145 --> 00:53:17,771
It’s a global movement all over.

456
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:25,350
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

457
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:28,747
They have ruined every religion.

458
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:37,011
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

459
00:53:37,524 --> 00:53:40,554
In Buddhism you give up everything -

460
00:53:40,729 --> 00:53:48,007
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

461
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:55,924
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

462
00:53:56,763 --> 00:54:03,319
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

463
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:09,397
misleading others just taking away everything.

464
00:54:10,424 --> 00:54:13,985
Then same thing about Christianity

465
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:17,091
that you all become Nuns,
 you become Fathers, you become

466
00:54:17,116 --> 00:54:20,869
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

467
00:54:21,126 --> 00:54:24,646
But there's no change within.

468
00:54:25,947 --> 00:54:32,056
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

469
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:34,855
He said, “Because I was jobless.

470
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:37,957
I had no job.”

471
00:54:37,957 --> 00:54:38,957
Baba?

472
00:54:38,957 --> 00:54:41,399
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

473
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:42,938
Can you imagine?

474
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:50,503
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

475
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,060
Then what did you do?

476
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:59,704
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

477
00:55:00,122 --> 00:55:04,614
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

478
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:11,650
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

479
00:55:11,817 --> 00:55:17,286
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

480
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:24,087
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

481
00:55:24,268 --> 00:55:31,499
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

482
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:39,372
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

483
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:44,109
Is that what religion gives you?

484
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:46,977
Is that what should happen to you?

485
00:55:47,096 --> 00:55:49,980
No, it's not that.

486
00:55:50,124 --> 00:55:56,287
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

487
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,586
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

488
00:55:58,586 --> 00:56:04,669
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

489
00:56:05,848 --> 00:56:10,407
So that changes the whole picture.

490
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:17,707
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

491
00:56:17,964 --> 00:56:25,461
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

492
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:30,459
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

493
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:33,876
if your husband dies then how many days?

494
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:40,198
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

495
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:44,920
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

496
00:56:44,945 --> 00:56:48,631
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

497
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:57,380
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

498
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:05,972
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

499
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:13,284
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

500
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:18,274
 in charge of higher life.

501
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:24,388
They lead such a mundane useless life.

502
00:57:26,473 --> 00:57:29,667
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

503
00:57:29,751 --> 00:57:35,791
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

504
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:40,768
And I was surprised.

505
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:50,016
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

506
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:58,110
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

507
00:57:58,396 --> 00:58:01,524
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

508
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:05,059
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

509
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:09,331
How much money you earn out of it?”

510
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:12,043
He said, “Quite a lot.”

511
00:58:12,305 --> 00:58:14,560
“And then what do you do with this money?

512
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:17,429
Do you do anything for the society?

513
00:58:17,454 --> 00:58:19,979
Do you try to improve their lives?

514
00:58:20,004 --> 00:58:26,541
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

515
00:58:26,696 --> 00:58:33,168
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
 his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

516
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:37,213
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

517
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:42,455
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

518
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:45,841
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

519
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:49,415
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

520
00:58:49,534 --> 00:58:54,802
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

521
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:59,646
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

522
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:03,636
But how can they?

523
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,460
They are not realized souls.

524
00:59:07,563 --> 00:59:12,833
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

525
00:59:12,873 --> 00:59:13,873
What?

526
00:59:14,064 --> 00:59:21,193
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

527
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:24,214
I can't understand.

528
00:59:24,482 --> 00:59:30,442
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

529
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:32,514
So they must respect.

530
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:36,251
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

531
00:59:36,276 --> 00:59:43,876
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

532
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,420
That is your job.

533
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:49,142
You don't have to fight with them.

534
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,016
You don't have to denounce them.

535
00:59:51,016 --> 00:59:54,137
You don't have to describe them.

536
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:57,977
No need, but understand that you are different.

537
00:59:57,977 --> 01:00:01,852
You have the right. You are the authority

538
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:05,221
 and so with that authority and confidence

539
01:00:05,246 --> 01:00:08,316
 you have to go about and save people.

540
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:11,765
You are realized souls.

541
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:14,619
You got your resurrection.

542
01:00:14,651 --> 01:00:20,681
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

543
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:23,358
Why, why this has happened?

544
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:30,238
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

545
01:00:30,897 --> 01:00:36,178
in your hands and take them towards the light.

546
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:40,293
This is what is your resurrection for.

547
01:00:40,468 --> 01:00:49,803
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

548
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:54,985
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

549
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:58,009
How many people have you given realization?

550
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:00,123
How many people you have talked to them?

551
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:03,550
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

552
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,194
 and there was some lady traveling with Me

553
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:12,142
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

554
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:15,799
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

555
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:21,624
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
 they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

556
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:27,615
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

557
01:01:27,805 --> 01:01:32,133
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

558
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:37,027
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

559
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:42,180
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

560
01:01:42,688 --> 01:01:45,623
or to be lost to the whole world.

561
01:01:45,648 --> 01:01:51,497
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

562
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,936
That's what you are there for

563
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,090
and you can do it. Many have done it.

564
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,452
So many of you have done it,

565
01:02:00,507 --> 01:02:07,101
and I would say that all of you, whether
 you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

566
01:02:08,784 --> 01:02:19,247
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

567
01:02:19,885 --> 01:02:26,350
And the attention should be only on realization.

568
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:31,888
How many people you are going to give realization to?

569
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:36,012
How many people you are going to save?

570
01:02:36,893 --> 01:02:39,957
Is a very simple job for you.

571
01:02:40,014 --> 01:02:41,995
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

572
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,143
You can.

573
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:47,802
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

574
01:02:47,827 --> 01:02:50,507
 and give them their resurrection.

575
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:53,155
You don't have to do anything.

576
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,424
The life is not that difficult for you.

577
01:02:56,463 --> 01:03:00,622
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

578
01:03:00,647 --> 01:03:03,098
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

579
01:03:03,173 --> 01:03:11,976
 just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

580
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:17,891
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

581
01:03:17,979 --> 01:03:20,832
you are all realized souls,

582
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,602
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
