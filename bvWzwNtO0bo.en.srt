1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,960
I am so very happy to see so many\h
Sahaja Yogis are here now in America.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,360
And the program we have had\h
the other day showed us clearly\h\h

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,200
that Sahaja Yoga is getting very popular\h
and the way people got their realization\h\h

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:38,720
in five minutes also showed that now we have\h
touched that area of seekers who are honest\h\h

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,840
and who are of a very high level in spirituality.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,560
You are the ones who are the first Sahaja\h
Yogis we should say or the foundation\h\h

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:03,040
of the Sahaja Yoga in America and thus we\h
have to understand our own responsibility.

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,840
As it is Vishuddhi Chakra is\h
responsible for the whole world.

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:24,720
But the people in Vishuddhi Chakra have to be\h
like Ganas, they have to be very responsible,\h\h

10
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,000
extremely, much more than any\h
other country in the whole world.

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:42,080
And the problem is somehow I found, I don’t\h
know about the future, that, that sense of\h\h

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,720
responsibility yet not felt among Sahaja Yogis\h
that they are responsible for the whole world;\h\h

13
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,480
not only for America or only for\h
New York or only for Yonkers.

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,240
Sitting down here you are\h
responsible for the whole world.

15
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,240
If you understand this that the main quality\h
of Vishuddhi Chakra is responsibility,\h\h

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
I always say, “It’s on my shoulder.

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,680
I take it on my shoulder”, meaning what?

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
That I take the responsibility,\h\h

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:36,000
but this sense of responsibility\h
has to come to you very clearly.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
I felt America is so far\h
away but if they could come\h\h

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:50,560
and see in Russia how the Russians are\h
behaving towards Sahaja Yoga they’ll be amazed.

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,960
I’ve been coming to America since so many years.

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Perhaps we should say this is\h
the first country I visited.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,160
But here the sense of responsibility\h
for Sahaja Yoga has not grown.

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,080
While in a country like Russia and Eastern\h
blocks I’ve been only four years there hardly\h\h

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,920
and you should see it how they feel responsible.

27
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,880
Now in Russia, Sahaja Yoga\h
has spread upto Siberia.

28
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,840
Now in Siberia they don’t live for\h
themselves only or for their Ashram.

29
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,120
There they have got a place called Novosibirsk,\h\h

30
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,640
which is mostly inhabited by scientists\h
because so many scientists were thrown away\h\h

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:54,240
by Czars and later on by the communists\h
and were exiled into that place.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,560
Now these people sitting there tried\h
to find out what is spirituality?

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
How do we get to spirituality?

34
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,400
What is the way we can be our spiritual being?

35
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,880
No quarrel, no fights, no stupid things\h
that people do, no domination, no ego.

36
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,640
I was there only about a week back I should\h
say, more than a week and last day before going,\h\h

37
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
there came a scientist.

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:44,080
His eyes really were just like\h
ocean, were absolutely beautiful\h\h

39
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,640
and he was supposed to be one of\h
the greatest scientist of Russia\h\h

40
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,800
having a very big job of his own and he\h
didn’t talk about too much to others.

41
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
He just wanted to see me.

42
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,160
When he came he just took my\h
hand and kissed it, bowed to me.

43
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,280
I saw in his eyes ocean of spirituality, ocean.

44
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,160
He must have been about\h
thirty-five or forty years of age.

45
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
Can’t say his age because he\h
was so much shining and bright\h\h

46
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
and he told me, “I know everything about Mother”.

47
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,440
I said, “What do you know?”

48
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,400
“That you are the incarnation of\h
God on this Earth to save us”.

49
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,840
“How did you find out?”

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
He said, “I have made a machine by\h
which I can measure energy fields,\h\h

51
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
of course I can’t measure your energy field.

52
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,920
But I took a small photograph of your\h
and measured the energy field and I found\h\h

53
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,520
it was seven hundred raised to power some\h
millions and then raised to power some billions”.

54
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,200
That’s why I don’t understand his calculation.

55
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,200
Just imagine, and he created\h\h

56
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:20,000
the whole idea of his proposed experiments for\h
which he had come to take permission from Me.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
He said, “You just touch this\h
glass Mother, just touch it”.

58
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
And he had brought a machine.

59
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,920
I touched the glass and machine\h
went on revolving like that.

60
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
I was myself surprised.

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,480
He said, “Just touching the glass it’s happening”.

62
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,400
He had a machine with him,\h
a little machine he said.

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
“This is portable”, he said.

64
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,160
So I said, “What is the permission you want?”

65
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
He said, “I want to use your photograph\h\h

66
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,720
on a Satellite and from the Satellite I want to\h
project your photograph through electromagnetic\h\h

67
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:10,240
force and wherever in the Global region it\h
will be put, you will see it will change.

68
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,400
It will change people, it will change all flora,\h
fauna and also ecological problems will be solved.

69
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,720
Will you give me permission for that”.

70
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
I said, “Of course why not?”

71
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,880
The level of scientist in that country\h
is so great, here I don’t think we can\h\h

72
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,320
get hold of any scientist because their\h
ego is keeping them hanging in the air.

73
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,240
The another thing, which I was surprised,\h
that in Novosibirsk, where a Yogi told them\h\h

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
that Mother has told us that in our brain\h
there are ‘peethas’ of these charkas.

75
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,400
They were so much surprised they said, “We\h
can verify, we have machines to verify”.

76
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
So they called Dr.

77
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
Khan and when Dr.

78
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
Khan went there, he was\h
amazed, they had a machine.

79
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,600
So he said, “Now let us put\h
attention to Shri Mataji”.

80
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,280
The whole brain became reddish.

81
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Then “Let us put attention to\h
heart”; here it became a red spot.

82
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,800
Then to Mooladhara, was here.

83
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
Then to Nabhi, on both the\h
places; then to Vishuddhi.

84
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,520
It was proved.

85
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,280
What I have said they have proved it.

86
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,960
And so many Americans are trying\h
to get them to this country.

87
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
They say, “We don’t want to come.

88
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,000
We don’t want to do any more Science, we\h
want to do Meta-science, spirituality”.

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,040
There are two hundred and fifty scientists\h
in Novosibirsk where I could not go\h\h

90
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,680
because we had a puja.

91
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,840
Now see the difference, here I come\h
there’s quarrels between husband – wife;\h\h

92
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,640
then it’s a father – mother.

93
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,360
All such petty nonsensical things are going on.

94
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:28,000
So your own brothers and sisters in\h
another country are doing so much of\h\h

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
experimentation, spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

96
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,680
Imagine how will I go to Siberia, out of question.

97
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,960
But from Siberia I don’t\h
know how many thousands came.

98
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,120
They are all well-educated, very well\h
equipped, extremely well behaved.

99
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,080
In their style, in their behavior you see that\h\h

100
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,680
there is such a lot of\h
spirituality already built in.

101
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:18,640
When I went to Ukraine; Ukraine is a place where\h
they had this, you know, Chernobyl problem.

102
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,360
First time when I had gone there were\h
people, who had come to my program.

103
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,480
They had their fingers joint like this,\h
noses turned like this, all kinds of things.

104
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,800
And the legs and feet were in a very funny way.

105
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
With all that, they came to the program\h\h

106
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,040
and this time that hall was so full there were\h
at least ten times more people than we are here,\h\h

107
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,400
maybe more and outside were standing, they\h
couldn’t get in, they are sitting in the passages.

108
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,640
They were three tier, on\h
the ground and three more.

109
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:05,760
Everything filled to a inch and I\h
was amazed at their spirituality.

110
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
Everyone got realization in five minutes.

111
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,440
What a level of people, what a level.

112
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,880
But then I found out that in Ukraine\h\h

113
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,960
they already had the knowledge of\h
Kundalini and of the Primordial Mother.

114
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,280
They call Her ‘Aditi’, in India also we call Her\h
‘Aditi’ and they used to make paintings of her.

115
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,760
Then they had paintings made of Agnya\h
Chakra, of Mooladhara, very clear.

116
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,800
In those days before Christ, three\h
thousand years before Christ.

117
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:56,840
So basically in them from where,\h
somewhere, this knowledge had come.

118
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
You are very advanced people here, supposed to.

119
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:11,840
You are very well equipped and people\h
think Americans are the top for everything.

120
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,800
But look at these people\h
from Ukraine and from Russia.

121
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,080
They were worshiping the Primordial Mother\h\h

122
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,240
three thousand before Christ and when\h
Christianity came, they suppressed it.

123
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
All clearly written down\h\h

124
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
and when people wrote about it also, these\h\h

125
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,520
Christians there, they were called as orthodox\h
Christian, they tried to kill them, arrest them.

126
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
Despite all those\h\h

127
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,400
problems they stuck on and I was surprised that\h
even today there are books and magazines about it.

128
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
So I was thinking somebody like Macchindranath\h
who went all over the world, must have gone\h\h

129
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,840
with his disciples Gorakhnath, because they were\h
Nath Panthis, they knew about Kundalini and all.

130
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:24,382
But actually they have shown the ‘Aditi’,\h
the Mother with the Kundalini in a stomach.

131
00:13:24,382 --> 00:13:27,360
Can you imagine?

132
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,160
All these things were done long\h
time back and that’s why basically\h\h

133
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
they are very spiritual people.

134
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:48,640
Firstly they are very introspective and very\h
spiritual and all the time they are asking “Mother\h\h

135
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
are we going to be all right?

136
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,360
Are we all right?

137
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,840
Have we really taken our ascent?” Like that\h\h

138
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,880
those questions, which were absolutely\h
different from what you see in the West.

139
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,880
In whatever field they are; if he is\h
a doctor he’ll try to find something.

140
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,080
A dentist, they’ll try to find\h
something, related to Sahaja Yoga\h\h

141
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,320
and they say, “There are so many\h
coincidences that you cannot explain.

142
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,800
How this has worked out, how?” So I said,\h
“What did you do?” He said, “We just desire\h\h

143
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,480
that we should now try to propagate Sahaja Yoga\h\h

144
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:43,360
and to analyze it and put, put it on such\h
a concrete way that nobody can doubt it.

145
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
No Scientist can doubt it”.

146
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,960
So we are at that level to\h
see somebody so much higher\h\h

147
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,720
and then we have also understanding\h
how we can rise upto that point?

148
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,840
How we have to work it out?

149
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,840
Now the pettiness with which we suffer can come\h
in many categories but is nothing but stupidity.

150
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,840
One of them is that, this idea of leadership;\h\h

151
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,360
which is greatest stupidity\h
you could ever think of.

152
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,680
I am just befooling you by\h
saying “You are a leader.

153
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,400
You are a leader”.

154
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,600
Nothing it’s just a myth,\h
you don’t believe me in that.

155
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,880
If I call you the leader, you must\h
know that Mother is trying to test you\h\h

156
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:51,360
and others also those who are trying this power\h
game of becoming leaders, nothing at the back.

157
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,080
There is no one who you can really say is\h
the leader of Sahaja Yoga except that I\h\h

158
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
had to have some people to\h
communicate so we call them leaders.

159
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,280
It doesn’t mean that if they become leaders,\h\h

160
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:16,800
they go to heaven; they will get a right\h
royal reception, nothing like that.

161
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,760
All will be going in the same manner.

162
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,760
See this is all created by Maya.

163
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:36,160
Now people are striving to become\h
leader, and I really feel like laughing.

164
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,880
Those who will try are climbing\h
a mountain, which doesn’t exist.

165
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
Where are you climbing?

166
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,320
Where are you going?

167
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
It doesn’t exist.

168
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
There’s no mountain, it’s\h
all straightforward road.

169
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,280
So this is also a sign of complete stupidity.

170
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,240
Are we to say that all the\h
stupids are born in this country?

171
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,680
Are we to feel that all stupidity has trickled\h
down to this country through Hudson River?

172
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,840
Are we to believe that all\h
intelligence has vanished into ego?

173
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,160
Once you realize it is stupidity, it’s best to\h
stand before the mirror and make fun of yourself.

174
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,000
Also I’ve noticed with all the writers of\h
Russia, they’ve been very introspective.

175
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,040
Even a hero will think ten times\h
“Why I am loving this lady?

176
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,400
Why I am doing this?” Even the woman if she’s\h
in love she’ll think, “Why am I doing that?

177
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
Should I do it or not?

178
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,280
It’s proper or not?

179
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,840
Is it something in my head that\h
is making me do it?” You see,\h\h

180
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,160
absolutely clearly they go\h
on introspecting themselves.

181
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,640
Even now I find the Russians are like that.

182
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
So we have to now start a new tradition.

183
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,320
In that tradition, we have to introspect.

184
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
Introspect yourself.

185
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:32,320
This another way is you shouldn’t\h
try to see the defects of others\h\h

186
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
but to see what’s wrong with you?

187
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,760
Where do you fail?

188
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,600
Why do you fail?

189
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
Why you cannot propagate Sahaja Yoga?

190
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
What is the reason to it?

191
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,080
What has failed you?

192
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,840
Because it’s only possible when you think you\h
are responsible, not leader but responsible.

193
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,080
This is the country where we’ve\h
had greatest fights for leadership\h\h

194
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,920
and all leaders have now jumped into river Hudson.

195
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,640
So this kind of stupid ideas should be given up\h\h

196
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
and we should introspect to\h
see how much stupid we are.

197
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:29,040
I had started believing that the special blessing\h
of Maya is on Americans that they are all stupid.

198
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,800
I used to really, I used to think,\h
I must confess, in a beginning.

199
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,840
Then I met you all and I\h
realized it’s not that bad.

200
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
Because I met so many important people,\h\h

201
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Ambassadors, this and that\h
and all that, in England.

202
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
I used to wonder what’s wrong with them.

203
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,240
They used to behave like young\h
boys of twenty years you see.

204
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,400
In Hindi we call it ‘gadha pachchsi’,\h
means at twenty-five you are a donkey.

205
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,080
And the way they used to pass jokes\h
and I say they have no dignity,\h\h

206
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,480
nothing; such high positions they\h
are having what do they talk about?

207
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
And they would stand out by that you know?

208
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
They said, “Ah we’re very smart” you know?

209
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
They would wink at everyone, they\h
would do all kinds of nonsensical\h\h

210
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,080
thing which normally a twenty year\h
boy might do anywhere once in a while.

211
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,920
But they were all like that.

212
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,440
They thought they were very young\h
and they would walk you see with very\h\h

213
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,400
great smartness you see like young boys.

214
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:58,160
To them it should be very fast and like you see a\h
bowler is about to bowl or some sort of a thing.

215
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,720
It was really unbelievable that these people\h
occupy such high position in the government.

216
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,560
How could they be so irresponsible?

217
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,640
But when I met you all then I really felt\h
that no no there are many good people also.

218
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,520
This comparison you can today also\h
see between you and these people.

219
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
They’ll argue for anything.

220
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,440
They’ll talk about anything like\h
for Freud they were fighting.

221
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,680
Freud’s told us something very new.

222
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,680
So I’ve written in my book, so I said, “All right\h\h

223
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,040
you have eaten all kinds of food before\h
but you have not eaten the table.

224
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,320
What about eating the table?”\h\h

225
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,840
So everything absurd, everything vulgar,\h
everything low level were justified.

226
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,000
I don’t blame him.

227
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:10,160
All these stupid people were\h
born here and they wrote books.

228
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,640
They were the ones who were Generals.

229
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
They were in-charge.

230
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
I mean I can’t understand.

231
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,000
You see this fellow Nought.

232
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
You can one minute you look at him\h
and you will know he’s a lunatic\h\h

233
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,880
and they gave him so much time so much\h
explanation; I mean I can’t understand.

234
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:47,120
And the idea about spirituality is like\h
somebody comes and tells you something absurd.

235
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,760
It’s new, it’s new, so do it.

236
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,590
Now they say that you shave your head;\h
all right, they shave their head.

237
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,640
They’ll say no “you grow\h
your hair” and they’ll grow.

238
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
As if they have no personality of their own.

239
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,840
They don’t think much about themselves.

240
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,840
They have no respect of themselves.

241
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,000
Even in those parties they used to tell me\h
“Ah have you been to this Guru?” I said,\h\h

242
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,240
“No I am sorry, I’ve not”\h
Nowadays its bargain better do it.

243
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Level of understanding of spirituality was also\h
so low of these people who were so highly placed\h\h

244
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:35,840
and I was really I was amazed how could\h
they do such things with such big position.

245
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
There was one fellow who was quite highly placed\h\h

246
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,520
he used to always look out for\h
me, whenever there was a party.

247
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,280
So C.P.

248
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,240
said, “Why does he look out for you?”\h
I said you know he wants to eat a lot\h\h

249
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,120
and here the food they serve in\h
England is not sufficient for him.

250
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,280
So he sit next to me so he\h
can share all my food you see.

251
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,400
That’s why he always there.

252
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
I eat very little.

253
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,040
So, so much interest in food.

254
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
Then when I was not there he\h
would go and sit with C.P.

255
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
because He knew the secret He\h
used to pass His food to him.

256
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,160
So much interest in food and himself was in a such\h
a big position and what was he boasting about?

257
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,400
That I come on a bicycle on a half pant to office.

258
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
So I said, “Why do you go on a half pant?”

259
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,320
“It’s better, for a bicycle”

260
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
“Why do you come in a bicycle?”

261
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,280
“It better for health”

262
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,400
“But after all you are such a big officer.

263
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,240
If you are going to your office\h
you should go on a motorcar.

264
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,320
You have such a big car and then this bicycle\h
you can do it in some sports club or something”.

265
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,080
Out of proportion, where are you going?

266
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
What work you have to do?

267
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,400
Why don’t you understand?

268
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,760
And he’s the one who used to\h
eat like a glutton I tell you.

269
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,920
He was thin like this.

270
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,280
Absolutely thin like this.

271
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,160
So I concluded must be worms in\h
his stomach or whatever it is.

272
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,920
I used have pity for him\h
because always very hungry.

273
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:20,160
Now, the attention if it is on food,\h
attention if it is on money, attention\h\h

274
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:32,240
if it is on so called power of leadership and\h
all that know that it will make you stupid.

275
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,560
Anybody who boasts, “I am the leader of this”.

276
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,560
All right, all right, very good!\h
You’ve known one like him you see?

277
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,000
That what you have to react because\h\h

278
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,160
if you say that I am the leader of this and\h
this, itself shows that you are a stupid fool,\h\h

279
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,840
isn’t it?

280
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,640
Because if you know it’s stupidity, all\h
this Mother is making a fool out of us,\h\h

281
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:12,880
why should you say, “I am the greatest fool?”\h
Why should you yourself boast of yourself?

282
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,920
Even any boasting is a sign\h
of a stupid fool you know?

283
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
Or a mad lunatic person.

284
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,600
Once our Prime Minister went to one lunatic\h
asylum and he met one who was sane to talk to.

285
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,720
So he asked him, “Who are you?”

286
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
He said, “I am Jawaharlal Nehru”

287
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,560
He said, “Who is Jawaharlal Nehru?”

288
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,800
He said, “I am the one who was the,\h
who is the Prime Minister of India”

289
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,680
“Aahh! You’ll be all right.

290
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,280
I used to say the same.

291
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:56,080
You stay here for five-six\h
months you’ll be all right”.

292
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,440
So all such bombastic talking those people who do,\h\h

293
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,720
you should just know I am telling you\h
certified lunatics or certified fools.

294
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:22,840
And once this goes, this stupidity into your\h
head you will be no more a Sahaja Yogi, no more.

295
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,640
Whole spirituality will come out\h
and you’ll be left high and dry.

296
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,160
Anyone who boasts like that\h\h

297
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,720
is worse but even if you think like\h
that is no good, not on a proper lines.

298
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,720
So because of this ego you don’t\h
understand your responsibility.

299
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,480
When you argue also I’ve seen people “But\h
I am the leader of this, I am the leader”.

300
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
I start looking at them\h
how can they live together.

301
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
How can they be collective, which\h
is the quality of Vishuddhi Chakra?

302
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,440
I just saw these trees, see how many they are?

303
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,760
Of different varieties, different qualities,\h\h

304
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,120
of different nature; absolutely\h
different, how they are living together?

305
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,160
They all share the same\h
sunlight, they don’t quarrel.

306
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,320
The tree doesn’t say, “I must fall onto another\h
one somehow because he thinks …..[UNCLEAR]”.

307
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,360
One thing is I cannot tell this\h
trees that you are the leader.

308
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,880
Only I can befool human beings.

309
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,600
This is the main thing is – please be careful.

310
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,440
Don’t be befooled by what I tell you, All right.

311
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,600
As far as, because if I see somebody stupid I do\h\h

312
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:03,680
pamper his ego so that it bursts forever\h
and he gets rid of his nonsensical ego.

313
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,760
But that’s not my job; point is\h
that I want you to be like Russians.

314
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,960
They don’t have any ego, nothing.

315
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,040
They don’t have any problem.

316
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,840
It’s so easy to deal with them because they\h
know what I am and they know what they are.

317
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,080
You cannot befool them, no.

318
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,280
Anyone, anyone whether he is the\h
biggest scientist or the highest\h\h

319
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,880
ranking official or the highest personality,\h
in any field, you cannot befool.

320
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,240
They are so humble.

321
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
And the Chinese, the same.

322
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,480
You have to learn a lot from Chinese also.

323
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:08,240
They are so sensitive to spirituality,\h
so beautiful they are, so humble.

324
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,280
You cannot tell them that you’ve\h
done something good work or anything.

325
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,080
They say, “No, so much to be done still.

326
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,560
It’s all right you are saying it in your\h
goodness but we know our weaknesses”.

327
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,100
But in America everything is fixed and also\h
your ego is fixed like that or so and a\h\h

328
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:29,680
slightest blow you bloat up and become so much\h
one that no trace of that drop should be there.

329
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,600
I am no more an individual,\h\h

330
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,520
I am the ocean and this collectivity has\h
to grow in this country not in Russia.

331
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,960
Everything is growing like a cancer you know.

332
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Supposing the nose starts coming out from here\h\h

333
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,400
and the mouth starts out coming\h
out from here what will happen?

334
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
This country had to have this capacity.

335
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,560
This country had to do this\h
while it’s done by Russia.

336
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,680
I don’t even know their language.

337
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,600
What you find here only the\h
false gurus are accepted\h\h

338
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:21,440
and in Sahaja Yoga people do not know\h
how to respect their self-realization.

339
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:31,840
So busy with their ego, so\h
much impressed by themselves.

340
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,280
The whole atmosphere is such\h
a competition, perfection.

341
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,840
It’s a big professional\h
achievement even in Sahaja Yoga.

342
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,000
Sahaja Yoga is not a profession\h\h

343
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,560
because profession means individuality of a drop.

344
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,920
This is a collective work, means what?

345
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,160
Sahaja Yoga is a surrender.

346
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,920
It’s not a profession, it’s a surrender.

347
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,160
You are a very intelligent people\h
but I think, little more than normal.

348
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,840
So all of you start thinking on your\h
own sometimes and bring problem.

349
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,840
But the difference of problem\h
of Russia and this place\h\h

350
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,160
is so much; somebody told me, “Mother you\h
must come and live here, will be good idea”.

351
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,840
I will I don’t mind but every\h
third step if you meet somebody\h\h

352
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:52,880
who is immoral, fifth step who is a stupid fool\h
and the seventh foot/ feet you find a person\h\h

353
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,400
who is about to give you a big lecture\h
on spirituality, so what to do?

354
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,200
Now you cannot be one of them, I must assure you.

355
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,200
You are not one of them; but sometimes\h
the atmosphere is so much full of speed\h\h

356
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,800
and so much full of this ego that you\h
do develop this ego business very fast.

357
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:27,680
So quick you know and whenever I see that I get\h
real fright; what’s going to happen to America?

358
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,320
It’s not your country; it’s not\h
the country of your government.

359
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:45,200
It’s the country of collectivity,\h
collective personality.

360
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,120
So now the other day we had so many people who\h
got their realization in five minutes time.

361
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,400
That means they are seekers.

362
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,560
They are great seekers, they are\h
frustrated, they got it without any problem.

363
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:09,520
But to make them understand Sahaja\h
Yoga, to make them absolutely,\h\h

364
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,840
can say, a ocean out of the drops, all that,\h\h

365
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,080
which is the most important thing you have to do.

366
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,760
You have to see that you make\h\h

367
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,200
Americans understand and realize what\h
is the greatness of their personality?

368
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:47,120
Why are they on this Earth of\h
spirituality and of collectivity?

369
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,840
Why?

370
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,200
Why you were born here, for what purpose?

371
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,200
You must evaluate.

372
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,120
It’s not so.

373
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,600
They’ll get attached to,\h
identification is too much, they get\h\h

374
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,000
attached to their children so much; if not, then\h
they will get attached to so called their power.

375
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,440
Then they get attached to their\h
house, then they get attached\h\h

376
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,080
to their grounds, then to the stones;\h
I don’t know what they get attached to.

377
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:29,840
You have to be that great, for that complete\h
detachment has to be brought in your life.

378
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,920
That is the most important thing.

379
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,280
This a kind of an identity with\h
this, this, and this and this\h\h

380
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,840
is not going to make you grow and if\h
you don’t grow, Sahaja Yoga won’t grow.

381
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,440
It will keep a very, very low level profile.

382
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:00,400
To get that high level profile you have\h
to do one thing is to surrender your ego.

383
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,880
The greatest problem of America is ‘Mr.

384
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,200
Ego’.

385
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,840
This ego must be controlled.

386
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,080
I will tell you it’s very simple everyday\h\h

387
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,560
if you use the way we have to clear\h
out our ego, everyday, everyday.

388
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,480
You can get rid of it\h\h

389
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,040
because the whole speed, atmosphere,\h
competition; all is to pamper your ego.

390
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,200
I have even seen some advertisement\h
talking about ego you see.

391
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,200
“This cigarette if you smoke\h
your ego will be pampered”.

392
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,560
Can you imagine?

393
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,760
And people buy that kind of a nonsense,\h
because they think it’s great to know\h\h

394
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,560
our ego will be pampered, as if\h
their ego is not already pampered.

395
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:10,640
So this ego business comes to people\h
because there’s no introspection.

396
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,600
When there is no introspection\h
you see one develops this ego.

397
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,200
I am something great.

398
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,920
Now say sitting down here if you start\h
say, “I am great, I am great, I am great”.

399
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,360
Do you become great?

400
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,920
You cannot.

401
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
There’s a story about a frog you must have heard\h\h

402
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,560
who was in a well and he used\h
to think no end of himself.

403
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,240
“I am everything, I am this, I am that”.

404
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Somebody told him that have you seen a cow?

405
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,320
He said, “What is cow?”

406
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,040
“It’s very big animal compared to you”.

407
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,320
“I can also become big.

408
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,600
Why not I will” and starts\h
growing, growing till he burst out.

409
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,040
So this is what it is we have to understand\h\h

410
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,720
that this ego business is the real,\h
real, real problem of America.

411
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,880
So now you have to surrender.

412
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,760
Now surrender to whom?

413
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,080
It’s like this that if you say you are\h
seekers, I mean you are seekers of everything.

414
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,200
You are seekers of money, seekers of\h
power, seekers of this, seekers of that.

415
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,840
But if you are seekers of truth then\h
just face yourself and know yourself\h\h

416
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:56,800
and know the truth that you\h
cannot be, you cannot be a person\h\h

417
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:07,160
of any value if you have this artificial\h
ego on your head like a big balloon, never.

418
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:18,800
This ego has to be brought down absolutely\h
and all of you should try to bring it down\h\h

419
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:32,880
by doing some sort of a special\h
method of searching within yourself.

420
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,520
You have to,\h\h

421
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,760
I don’t know how to detach\h
yourself and see for yourself is\h\h

422
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,560
rather a difficult thing\h
because ego is very satisfied.

423
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
This is the biggest problem.

424
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:57,120
Ego gives great satisfaction and\h
with that ego you see you react\h\h

425
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,880
and reaction has become like\h
a sort of a might or a fright.

426
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,240
React; “I don’t like it, I don’t like\h
that, I don’t like that” Who are you?

427
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,320
If somebody say, “I don’t like you”, finished.

428
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,800
First of all you should\h
say, “I don’t like myself”.

429
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,760
Let’s start like that.

430
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,120
Why?

431
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,600
Because all my life is centered\h
round this, I am doing this,\h\h

432
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,200
I am doing that stupidity, another\h
stupidity; how can I like myself?

433
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,840
I am the Spirit.

434
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,480
Then you will start growing because\h
this conditioning keeps you down.

435
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,760
But somebody asked me, “Who is interested\h
in growing Mother?” I said, “Why?

436
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,680
They’re not?” They are not Sahaja Yogis, finished.

437
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,400
So there’s going to be a great ship\h
coming down to take all the Sahaja Yogis\h\h

438
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,520
to enter into the kingdom of God.

439
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,240
So why, why should we introspect?

440
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,120
You have to grow.

441
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,200
Even the stage is not there that is confirmed\h
that you’ll enter into the kingdom of God.

442
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,280
You have to give up this stupid idea of ego.

443
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,720
But what should replace it?

444
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,000
What will replace it?

445
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,840
Is love and compassion.

446
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,160
That two people can use it with the ego like I\h
tell somebody now this fellow is not all right.

447
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,840
“But Mother you know he is, I love him”.

448
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,840
If you love him better correct it.

449
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,320
If you really love, have courage to\h
tell him that this is wrong with you.

450
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,840
If you are continuing with this love\h
story, then you must correct that person.

451
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,240
And all these complicated you know such\h
complicated things there are with this ego\h\h

452
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,560
that you just don’t know how to solve the problem\h
sometimes if somebody comes to you with that ego.

453
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,440
So first is to introspect and\h
find out why am I egoistical?

454
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,840
What have I done?

455
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,360
You’ll surprised, I don’t know what is ego is.

456
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,800
I really, I’ve just seen some things,\h\h

457
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,080
but to be very frank I don’t\h
know what people are egoistic of.

458
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
Like sometimes you start saying My ‘Jai’.

459
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,720
I also says ‘Jai’.

460
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,320
I don’t think it’s me you are saying ‘Jai’.

461
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,480
Just say – all right they are\h
saying Jai, like that I say Jai,\h\h

462
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,640
because I don’t know why you say Jai.

463
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,440
I don’t know why?

464
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:16,800
What have I done?

465
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,800
Why are you praising me I just don’t understand?

466
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
If somebody says “Thank you very much Mother”.

467
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,800
I don’t understand why they are thanking for what?

468
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:30,880
What have I done?

469
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:41,120
See this ego is the one that records\h
everything that this is what it is.

470
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,560
I am such and I am such and\h
I am such, all falsehood.

471
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,360
But if you don’t have such a record\h
in your head you cannot feel ego.

472
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,960
If somebody says, “You are very good\h
looking”, immediately the balloon starts.

473
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,360
Why is he saying?

474
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,240
May be he wants some money, maybe he wants to use\h
you for some purpose, may be he’s praising because\h\h

475
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,160
he knows you are a stupid fool.

476
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:21,920
So why accept such a remark\h
as something great you know.

477
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,760
And in this way we lose ourselves completely.

478
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,040
Let us have a command of ourselves.

479
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,000
Do we know ourselves?

480
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,440
I know I am that, I know I am born like that,\h
I know all these things are there, so what?

481
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,960
I mean I didn’t achieve\h
anything, you at least achieved.

482
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,680
I never achieved anything; I was just like that.

483
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,840
So, why to be conscious of it?

484
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,760
That I am this, I am; I am nothing.

485
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,640
Because whatever I am, I am.

486
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,200
Now supposing this wood says\h
“Oh I am wood”, so what?

487
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,320
You are wood after all.

488
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,880
As simple as that, as simple as that.

489
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,480
So, see this complications of\h
your mind should be reduced\h\h

490
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,200
otherwise your attention will never improve\h
and what will happen is that you’ll not grow.

491
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,840
And the dwarfs, you know?

492
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,720
We’ll have all the dwarfs here.

493
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,160
I want to show to Russians that\h
you are quite capable of growing\h\h

494
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,760
and you are quite capable of\h
looking after your country.

495
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,840
Your own President, his wife\h
all of them are funny people.

496
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,440
Try to talk nonsense sometimes,\h
absolute, can’t understand.

497
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:59,920
What business they have got to talk about other\h
countries when their own country is suffering so?

498
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,200
There’s no introspection, there’s no understanding\h
what’s wrong with your own country and you start\h\h

499
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,560
talking about other countries ‘this is\h
wrong with them that is wrong with them’.

500
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,960
So in this atmosphere where you find a whole\h
lot of people have this problem of ego,\h\h

501
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,320
you can only supercede them, only shine out,\h\h

502
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:31,320
you can only save them by absolutely getting\h
rid of your ego, absolutely, hundred percent;\h\h

503
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,920
in every way.

504
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,160
You’ll see you’ll feel much lighter.

505
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,880
Imagine you are hanging in the air, you\h
don’t know where you are going to land?

506
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,880
How can you feel secured?

507
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,560
As they say ‘stand on your legs’.

508
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,640
It’s like that; stand on your leg.

509
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:07,760
So now Sahaja Yoga is progressing very well,\h
very fast everywhere in the whole world.

510
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,760
They gave Me a Doctorate, they did this,\h\h

511
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,000
they are trying their level best\h
now to give Me a Nobel Prize also.

512
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,240
Because only the Nobel Prize can put\h
these egoistical people all right.

513
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,960
So they are working very\h
hard to get Me a Nobel Prize.

514
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,360
All that is to show that people\h
will never accept me unless and\h\h

515
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,680
until I have some sort of a brand on my head.

516
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:43,600
But is important, in this world one\h
has to have some sort of a brand if he\h\h

517
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,200
have to survive, everything.

518
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,600
So, for you also it is important that you\h
have to have the brand of Sahaja Yogi.

519
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,800
But in Sahaja Yoga if you have\h
the brand doesn’t work out.

520
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,840
You have to have in reality\h
that power of Yoga within you.

521
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:12,560
You can do a lot I know because you stand\h
on land of Shri Krishna and His power.

522
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,320
Don’t need anything else, need;\h
don’t need any machinery, nothing.

523
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:26,640
But only realize your responsibility, what\h
we are doing for Sahaja Yoga, for our self?

524
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,680
How are we behaving?

525
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,840
What is our style?

526
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,920
How are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

527
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,560
Please try.

528
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,120
If you can really introspect you’ll find\h\h

529
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,960
that you’ll feel that we haven’t done much\h
for Sahaja Yoga that we could’ve done.

530
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,160
Busy with yourself, with your own activities.

531
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,080
But unless and until you do\h
for Sahaja Yoga something\h\h

532
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:02,000
you have no meaning at all, you have no identity.

533
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,840
If you can develop this beautiful\h
reflective nature by which you just\h\h

534
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:17,120
reflect about yourself and not about others,\h
you’ll be amazed, how much will change.

535
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,800
Even a simple meditation people don’t do.

536
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,600
You get them an Ashram; there they fight.

537
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,840
Do what you like ends up into something funny.

538
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,640
I didn’t want to talk to you about\h
something unpleasant all the time.

539
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,840
It’s not a very good idea.

540
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:47,360
But I feel that you should now awaken to the\h
fact what is your responsibility as Americans?

541
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,920
Very important, extremely important.

542
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,480
And once you realize that you can do so\h
many things because you have got the Power.

543
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,480
You have the Divine Power.

544
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,560
But you must awaken and shed off this horrible\h
thing called ego, which makes you a monkey.

545
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,680
I’ve seen this is the only problem you have.

546
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,040
There’s not much conditioning.

547
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
But this ego is the only problem.

548
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,800
You don’t respect anyone, you\h
don’t respect this Motherland,\h\h

549
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,600
you don’t respect even your self-realization.

550
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,680
So this point today we have to know that we are,\h\h

551
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,720
we cannot afford to have this\h
ego anymore on our heads.

552
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,440
We just are not going to have it.

553
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,600
We are going to humble down and we are going\h
to seek to things through our humility.

554
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:59,600
Once you see these things work out\h
you’ll be the most important persons\h\h

555
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,480
for even the Divine to deliver the goods.

556
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,840
May God bless you.

557
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,760
As it is we have now, I am awaiting\h
lots of Americans will become\h\h

558
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:22,720
and what will convince them of you is\h
your humility and your good manners;\h\h

559
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,440
very important.

560
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,240
If these two things they\h
see in you they will change.

561
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,480
I am sure they will change.

562
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,360
Not to be aggressive with them.
