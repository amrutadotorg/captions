00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:28.012
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:37.012
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:42.351
His power comes from his innocence.

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:47.153
When we see small children we are automatically

00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:50.772
compelled towards them

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:58.292
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

00:04:58.452 --> 00:05:03.212
And very innocent they are,

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:06.812
extremely innocent,

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:13.332
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

00:05:13.492 --> 00:05:20.292
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:27.172
These days people have become extremely cunning,

00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:30.972
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

00:05:31.132 --> 00:05:34.532
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:38.572
who are innocent and simple.

00:05:38.732 --> 00:05:41.972
They can justify themselves always

00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:47.052
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:50.332
when everybody is so cunning.

00:05:50.492 --> 00:06:00.572
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:03.892
which is very much punishable,

00:06:04.172 --> 00:06:09.732
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

00:06:09.892 --> 00:06:13.732
which are physical, you can say.

00:06:14.092 --> 00:06:22.052
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

00:06:23.012 --> 00:06:26.252
Also, they can have other troubles

00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:29.932
with their liver treatments and all that.

00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:35.972
All this comes up. Then to punish them

00:06:36.132 --> 00:06:41.652
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:45.052
At this time, when you have these problems,

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:48.452
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

00:06:48.612 --> 00:06:51.492
should worship Shri Ganesha.

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:59.052
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:04.532
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

00:07:04.692 --> 00:07:08.732
extra work, I should say, than normal.

00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:13.452
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

00:07:13.612 --> 00:07:17.892
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:25.372
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

00:07:25.532 --> 00:07:28.172
One of the two things come up

00:07:28.332 --> 00:07:32.492
and he does not know where he is going.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:38.692
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

00:07:38.852 --> 00:07:43.332
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:07:43.492 --> 00:07:50.692
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

00:07:50.852 --> 00:07:54.049
All these diseases of the right side

00:07:54.209 --> 00:07:58.612
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

00:07:58.772 --> 00:08:04.572
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:12.012
but there is a simple way to remember him

00:08:12.172 --> 00:08:17.572
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

00:08:17.732 --> 00:08:21.492
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:26.412
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

00:08:26.572 --> 00:08:30.252
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

00:08:30.452 --> 00:08:35.132
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

00:08:35.292 --> 00:08:39.972
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

00:08:40.132 --> 00:08:44.932
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:47.612
and all the worries from you.

00:08:47.772 --> 00:08:51.692
So this is the most important deity we have.

00:08:51.852 --> 00:08:55.052
Though its a very simple deity.

00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:58.732
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:02.092
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

00:09:02.252 --> 00:09:10.772
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

00:09:10.932 --> 00:09:17.772
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:20.652
So to steady down these

00:09:20.812 --> 00:09:27.852
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

00:09:28.092 --> 00:09:35.052
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:40.012
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

00:09:40.172 --> 00:09:44.172
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:48.492
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

00:09:48.652 --> 00:09:53.892
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:56.012
he never said who it was.

00:09:56.172 --> 00:10:00.972
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:07.572
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.452
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

00:10:10.612 --> 00:10:13.292
he used to go all out to fight it.

00:10:13.452 --> 00:10:15.412
Same is Shri Ganesha.

00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:20.492
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:25.532
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:28.852
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

00:10:29.012 --> 00:10:33.692
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:38.132
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:42.892
in different troubles and hurdles and also

00:10:43.052 --> 00:10:46.532
different type of very very difficult times.

00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:51.132
It is his style that he manages things so well

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:53.972
because he is a Ganapati.

00:10:54.132 --> 00:11:00.092
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

00:11:00.252 --> 00:11:04.852
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

00:11:05.012 --> 00:11:13.012
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:17.092
who report if there is any problem.

00:11:17.252 --> 00:11:21.372
They report to the brain that there is a problem

00:11:21.532 --> 00:11:28.172
and on the sternum bone is the residence

00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:33.972
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

00:11:34.132 --> 00:11:42.972
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

00:11:43.132 --> 00:11:46.692
sternum bone starts vibrating

00:11:46.852 --> 00:11:53.332
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:57.492
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

00:11:57.652 --> 00:12:02.612
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

00:12:02.772 --> 00:12:06.732
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:10.852
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

00:12:11.012 --> 00:12:13.652
are helped by Ganas is not true.

00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:17.132
Also the people who are mentally upset,

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:22.012
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

00:12:22.172 --> 00:12:27.292
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

00:12:27.452 --> 00:12:32.372
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

00:12:32.532 --> 00:12:39.012
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

00:12:39.172 --> 00:12:43.812
Now his parents start crying for Mother

00:12:43.972 --> 00:12:47.932
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

00:12:48.092 --> 00:12:51.692
that they immediately rush to that place

00:12:51.852 --> 00:12:56.332
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

00:12:56.492 --> 00:13:00.092
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

00:13:00.252 --> 00:13:06.892
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:10.652
They are also small like him

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:14.412
and they are very active and very alert.

00:13:14.572 --> 00:13:16.532
They never sleep.

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:20.732
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

00:13:20.892 --> 00:13:25.732
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:32.052
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:36.452
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:40.772
For example there was a boy who got drowned

00:13:40.932 --> 00:13:47.172
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:49.252
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

00:13:49.412 --> 00:13:51.972
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

00:13:52.132 --> 00:13:54.292
because there were children.

00:13:54.452 --> 00:13:57.012
So one boy fell down into that

00:13:57.172 --> 00:14:00.372
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:14:00.532 --> 00:14:02.492
Nobody knew he was there.

00:14:02.652 --> 00:14:08.172
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

00:14:08.332 --> 00:14:11.892
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:16.852
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

00:14:17.012 --> 00:14:20.532
After that they got so frightened

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:24.292
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

00:14:24.452 --> 00:14:26.972
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:29.402
I didn’t know even the address.

00:14:29.562 --> 00:14:33.972
But I asked to telephone to this number,

00:14:34.132 --> 00:14:37.052
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

00:14:37.212 --> 00:14:42.812
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

00:14:42.972 --> 00:14:46.052
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

00:14:46.212 --> 00:14:47.772
and he will be saved.

00:14:47.932 --> 00:14:49.932
Nobody had told me anything.

00:14:50.092 --> 00:14:52.692
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

00:14:52.852 --> 00:14:57.532
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

00:14:57.692 --> 00:15:01.572
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

00:15:01.732 --> 00:15:04.252
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

00:15:04.412 --> 00:15:07.292
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

00:15:07.452 --> 00:15:09.892
If there is one chance of his surviving,

00:15:10.052 --> 00:15:14.972
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

00:15:15.132 --> 00:15:18.092
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

00:15:18.252 --> 00:15:20.172
So, like this, so many things happen

00:15:20.332 --> 00:15:26.292
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:29.892
your blessings that this has happened.

00:15:30.052 --> 00:15:32.892
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

00:15:33.052 --> 00:15:35.492
but because of Shri Ganesha.

00:15:35.652 --> 00:15:38.132
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:41.652
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:47.652
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

00:15:47.812 --> 00:15:51.252
To him his Mother is everything.

00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:54.412
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

00:15:54.572 --> 00:16:00.092
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:07.612
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

00:16:07.772 --> 00:16:12.372
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

00:16:12.532 --> 00:16:17.932
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

00:16:18.092 --> 00:16:21.252
but His work is tremendous.

00:16:21.412 --> 00:16:26.132
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:32.052
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

00:16:32.212 --> 00:16:35.892
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

00:16:36.052 --> 00:16:42.172
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

00:16:42.332 --> 00:16:46.852
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

00:16:47.012 --> 00:16:49.452
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

00:16:49.612 --> 00:16:52.612
Its not only in women but also in men,

00:16:52.772 --> 00:16:55.932
he expects chastity to be present.

00:16:56.092 --> 00:17:01.292
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:04.692
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

00:17:04.852 --> 00:17:10.772
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:15.092
of communicating with young women and young men

00:17:15.252 --> 00:17:18.012
and spoiling your chastity.

00:17:18.172 --> 00:17:21.012
Even your eyes should be clean,

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:23.692
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

00:17:23.852 --> 00:17:27.772
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

00:17:27.932 --> 00:17:30.372
what mistakes you have committed

00:17:30.532 --> 00:17:37.372
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

00:17:37.532 --> 00:17:42.812
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

00:17:42.972 --> 00:17:46.332
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

00:17:46.492 --> 00:17:50.732
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:53.532
but that is a very important thing.

00:17:53.692 --> 00:17:58.852
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

00:17:59.012 --> 00:18:00.572
We should be very chaste.

00:18:00.732 --> 00:18:04.772
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

00:18:04.932 --> 00:18:08.572
But religions have become so useless now,

00:18:08.732 --> 00:18:12.012
have become without any basis,

00:18:12.172 --> 00:18:22.692
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

00:18:22.852 --> 00:18:26.252
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

00:18:26.412 --> 00:18:30.612
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

00:18:30.772 --> 00:18:33.812
Actually the religions have failed completely

00:18:33.972 --> 00:18:38.812
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:41.092
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:44.452
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

00:18:44.612 --> 00:18:48.132
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

00:18:48.292 --> 00:18:54.972
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

00:18:55.132 --> 00:18:59.932
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

00:19:00.092 --> 00:19:06.692
and where people are also having very bad morals.

00:19:06.852 --> 00:19:11.492
He creates problems for them. What happens that

00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:18.532
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

00:19:18.692 --> 00:19:21.076
Earthquake takes place in places where

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:24.892
there is no respect of chastity,

00:19:25.052 --> 00:19:28.892
also where there are fundamentalist

00:19:29.052 --> 00:19:35.892
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

00:19:36.052 --> 00:19:40.812
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

00:19:40.972 --> 00:19:43.252
So the Mother earth also understands.

00:19:43.412 --> 00:19:46.852
Now we have so many earthquakes,

00:19:47.012 --> 00:19:49.292
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

00:19:49.452 --> 00:19:52.452
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

00:19:52.612 --> 00:19:54.372
So he protects them.

00:19:54.532 --> 00:19:59.252
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:01.452
he tries to destroy them,

00:20:01.612 --> 00:20:05.572
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

00:20:05.732 --> 00:20:16.492
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

00:20:16.652 --> 00:20:19.372
he attracts people towards himself,

00:20:19.532 --> 00:20:24.372
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

00:20:24.532 --> 00:20:29.172
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

00:20:29.332 --> 00:20:34.852
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

00:20:35.012 --> 00:20:38.052
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

00:20:38.212 --> 00:20:41.772
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

00:20:41.932 --> 00:20:46.532
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

00:20:46.692 --> 00:20:50.252
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

00:20:50.412 --> 00:20:56.932
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

00:20:57.092 --> 00:21:01.852
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

00:21:02.012 --> 00:21:06.412
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

00:21:06.572 --> 00:21:08.732
they go back to their own place.

00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:12.092
So going back to the same place is only possible

00:21:12.252 --> 00:21:15.092
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

00:21:15.252 --> 00:21:19.532
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

00:21:19.692 --> 00:21:23.652
also they are bound by their own qualities.

00:21:23.812 --> 00:21:28.692
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

00:21:28.852 --> 00:21:31.092
and a lion will be a lion.

00:21:31.252 --> 00:21:34.852
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

00:21:35.012 --> 00:21:37.132
So they could be anything, you can’t say

00:21:37.292 --> 00:21:41.172
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

00:21:41.332 --> 00:21:43.932
And once they become anything like that

00:21:44.092 --> 00:21:48.692
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

00:21:48.852 --> 00:21:51.252
when they are human beings.

00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:56.012
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

00:21:56.172 --> 00:22:01.092
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

00:22:01.252 --> 00:22:05.572
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

00:22:05.732 --> 00:22:10.572
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

00:22:10.732 --> 00:22:13.652
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

00:22:13.812 --> 00:22:18.252
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

00:22:18.412 --> 00:22:26.092
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:26.252 --> 00:22:28.292
Before the statue they dance

00:22:28.452 --> 00:22:34.852
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

00:22:35.012 --> 00:22:40.532
music from some very funny films or something.

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.652
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

00:22:43.812 --> 00:22:47.932
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

00:22:48.092 --> 00:22:52.292
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

00:22:52.452 --> 00:22:54.732
and they were dancing before it.

00:22:54.892 --> 00:23:00.492
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

00:23:00.652 --> 00:23:04.932
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

00:23:05.092 --> 00:23:09.452
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

00:23:09.612 --> 00:23:13.092
At that time the earth moved

00:23:13.252 --> 00:23:22.852
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

00:23:23.012 --> 00:23:25.332
They all disappeared into earth.

00:23:25.492 --> 00:23:28.652
Apart from that there were many others also

00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:33.052
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:36.892
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

00:23:37.052 --> 00:23:44.652
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

00:23:44.812 --> 00:23:50.732
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

00:23:50.892 --> 00:23:56.012
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

00:23:56.172 --> 00:24:05.292
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

00:24:05.452 --> 00:24:10.412
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

00:24:10.732 --> 00:24:12.892
They were all right.

00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:18.012
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

00:24:18.172 --> 00:24:20.688
and this is how they saved the Ashram

00:24:20.848 --> 00:24:23.652
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

00:24:23.812 --> 00:24:28.052
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

00:24:28.212 --> 00:24:31.972
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

00:24:32.132 --> 00:24:34.612
So we must respect his Ganas,

00:24:34.772 --> 00:24:39.372
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

00:24:39.532 --> 00:24:41.572
they are acting within us.

00:24:41.732 --> 00:24:44.892
They see us what sort of person you are,

00:24:45.052 --> 00:24:49.812
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

00:24:49.972 --> 00:24:51.975
by your misbehavior

00:24:52.135 --> 00:24:56.412
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

00:24:56.572 --> 00:24:58.572
They give you a chance many a times.

00:24:58.732 --> 00:25:06.212
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

00:25:06.372 --> 00:25:12.932
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

00:25:13.092 --> 00:25:17.012
I should say, calamity for you people.

00:25:17.172 --> 00:25:19.772
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

00:25:19.932 --> 00:25:23.172
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

00:25:23.332 --> 00:25:28.732
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

00:25:28.892 --> 00:25:31.932
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

00:25:32.092 --> 00:25:34.612
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

00:25:34.772 --> 00:25:41.172
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:46.132
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

00:25:46.292 --> 00:25:49.012
so we are not at all helped by this.

00:25:49.172 --> 00:25:51.892
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

00:25:52.052 --> 00:25:55.812
don’t do any worship of any idol

00:25:55.972 --> 00:25:59.692
because these idols have been created by human beings

00:25:59.852 --> 00:26:04.492
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

00:26:04.652 --> 00:26:06.972
They are not created by the mother earth

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:09.891
but are copied by people

00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:13.532
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

00:26:13.692 --> 00:26:17.332
So that’s, how any idol you get,

00:26:17.492 --> 00:26:23.612
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:26.972
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

00:26:27.132 --> 00:26:29.812
So whatever is not there,

00:26:29.972 --> 00:26:34.012
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

00:26:34.172 --> 00:26:37.612
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

00:26:37.772 --> 00:26:41.732
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

00:26:41.892 --> 00:26:45.132
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:48.172
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

00:26:48.332 --> 00:26:52.972
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

00:26:53.132 --> 00:26:57.012
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

00:26:57.172 --> 00:27:03.492
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:08.892
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

00:27:09.052 --> 00:27:13.172
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

00:27:13.332 --> 00:27:17.852
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

00:27:18.012 --> 00:27:22.772
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

00:27:22.932 --> 00:27:25.972
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

00:27:26.132 --> 00:27:29.172
and how he is doing this to us.”

00:27:29.332 --> 00:27:35.692
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

00:27:35.852 --> 00:27:41.932
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:43.452
And then he realized it.

00:27:43.612 --> 00:27:46.292
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

00:27:46.452 --> 00:27:51.732
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:56.172
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

00:27:56.332 --> 00:27:58.852
and being very cunning and clever.

00:27:59.012 --> 00:28:03.572
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

00:28:03.732 --> 00:28:11.012
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

00:28:11.172 --> 00:28:16.532
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

00:28:16.692 --> 00:28:21.772
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

00:28:21.932 --> 00:28:25.052
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

00:28:25.212 --> 00:28:27.972
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

00:28:28.132 --> 00:28:34.372
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

00:28:34.532 --> 00:28:37.612
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

00:28:37.772 --> 00:28:43.292
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

00:28:43.452 --> 00:28:50.332
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

00:28:50.492 --> 00:28:58.732
that he can move mountains after mountains.

00:28:58.892 --> 00:29:05.292
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

00:29:05.452 --> 00:29:12.612
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

00:29:12.772 --> 00:29:15.892
can be changed.

00:29:16.812 --> 00:29:21.612
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

00:29:21.772 --> 00:29:23.852
of the right direction.

00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:29.892
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

00:29:30.052 --> 00:29:34.452
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

00:29:34.612 --> 00:29:37.972
it was the right type and he was successful.

00:29:38.132 --> 00:29:41.132
But then what happened, they had stencils

00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:43.892
and they started using it from the other side.

00:29:44.052 --> 00:29:47.172
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

00:29:47.332 --> 00:29:50.452
and then they were all destroyed.

00:29:50.612 --> 00:29:54.572
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:56.820
Also we have proved now

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.932
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

00:30:01.092 --> 00:30:04.652
is actually from the Carbon atom.

00:30:04.812 --> 00:30:07.372
The carbon atom has got Swastika

00:30:07.532 --> 00:30:14.332
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

00:30:14.492 --> 00:30:16.372
all put in series.

00:30:16.532 --> 00:30:21.692
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

00:30:21.852 --> 00:30:24.412
look at it from the left side to right side,

00:30:24.572 --> 00:30:28.412
what you see is Omkar.

00:30:28.572 --> 00:30:31.212
If you see it from right side to left side,

00:30:31.372 --> 00:30:32.972
you see the Swastika,

00:30:33.132 --> 00:30:39.852
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

00:30:40.012 --> 00:30:45.212
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

00:30:45.372 --> 00:30:50.052
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

00:30:50.212 --> 00:30:53.652
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

00:30:53.812 --> 00:30:57.732
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

00:30:57.892 --> 00:31:01.052
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

00:31:01.212 --> 00:31:05.812
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

00:31:05.972 --> 00:31:10.012
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

00:31:10.172 --> 00:31:11.772
because we are confused.

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:14.052
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

00:31:14.212 --> 00:31:16.092
that this is already written there.

00:31:16.252 --> 00:31:21.692
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

00:31:21.852 --> 00:31:29.092
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

00:31:29.252 --> 00:31:35.372
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

00:31:35.532 --> 00:31:38.372
All the things I have told you about Christ,

00:31:38.532 --> 00:31:44.852
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

00:31:45.012 --> 00:31:48.012
Like Christ had these two fingers,

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:52.492
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

00:31:52.652 --> 00:31:57.132
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

00:31:57.292 --> 00:32:01.012
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

00:32:01.172 --> 00:32:04.692
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

00:32:04.852 --> 00:32:07.452
only these two fingers why did he use.

00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:10.277
Pointing out towards his father

00:32:10.437 --> 00:32:14.352
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

00:32:14.692 --> 00:32:17.932
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

00:32:18.092 --> 00:32:21.412
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:28.252
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

00:32:28.412 --> 00:32:33.812
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

00:32:33.972 --> 00:32:37.972
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

00:32:38.132 --> 00:32:39.908
So it all opens out

00:32:40.068 --> 00:32:45.484
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

00:32:45.652 --> 00:32:49.612
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

00:32:49.772 --> 00:32:54.892
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

00:32:55.052 --> 00:32:59.052
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

00:32:59.212 --> 00:33:01.012
You are no more cunning.

00:33:01.172 --> 00:33:07.732
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

00:33:07.892 --> 00:33:12.972
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

00:33:13.132 --> 00:33:18.132
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

00:33:18.292 --> 00:33:25.092
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

00:33:25.252 --> 00:33:29.972
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

00:33:30.132 --> 00:33:34.332
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

00:33:34.492 --> 00:33:37.532
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

00:33:37.692 --> 00:33:43.743
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:33:43.903 --> 00:33:47.663
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

00:33:47.823 --> 00:33:51.252
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

00:33:51.412 --> 00:33:53.412
We don’t look after the mother earth.

00:33:53.572 --> 00:33:56.892
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

00:33:57.052 --> 00:34:01.012
Actually in Indian culture it is that

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:04.172
when you are getting up in the morning,

00:34:04.332 --> 00:34:09.252
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

00:34:09.412 --> 00:34:13.692
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

00:34:13.852 --> 00:34:16.932
because I am touching you with my feet.

00:34:17.092 --> 00:34:19.412
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

00:34:19.572 --> 00:34:21.292
then you won’t exploit it,

00:34:21.452 --> 00:34:25.052
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

00:34:25.212 --> 00:34:28.052
It all comes out of our ignorance

00:34:28.212 --> 00:34:32.612
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:34:32.772 --> 00:34:36.452
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

00:34:36.612 --> 00:34:41.092
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

00:34:41.252 --> 00:34:44.172
what is to be done.

00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:47.252
The mother earth itself we should look after,

00:34:47.412 --> 00:34:51.012
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:53.412
we can do all kinds of things

00:34:53.572 --> 00:34:59.092
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

00:34:59.252 --> 00:35:03.932
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

00:35:04.092 --> 00:35:07.172
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

00:35:07.332 --> 00:35:11.892
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

00:35:12.052 --> 00:35:13.932
is a very wrong thing.

00:35:14.092 --> 00:35:17.692
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

00:35:17.852 --> 00:35:19.852
you should put another one there.

00:35:20.012 --> 00:35:23.372
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

00:35:23.532 --> 00:35:27.972
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

00:35:28.132 --> 00:35:35.572
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

00:35:35.732 --> 00:35:38.932
I don’t know how they live but they do

00:35:39.092 --> 00:35:45.092
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

00:35:45.252 --> 00:35:49.132
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

00:35:49.292 --> 00:35:55.172
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

00:35:55.332 --> 00:35:58.332
that it should get the sunrays.

00:35:58.492 --> 00:36:00.052
There is no quarrel about it.

00:36:00.212 --> 00:36:03.852
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

00:36:04.012 --> 00:36:09.132
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:11.492
The animals also don’t destroy,

00:36:11.652 --> 00:36:14.692
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

00:36:14.852 --> 00:36:18.532
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

00:36:18.692 --> 00:36:21.172
do not destroy anything

00:36:21.332 --> 00:36:27.212
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

00:36:27.372 --> 00:36:30.492
Whatever may be the cry for this,

00:36:30.652 --> 00:36:34.412
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

00:36:34.572 --> 00:36:37.412
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

00:36:37.572 --> 00:36:41.532
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

00:36:41.692 --> 00:36:46.532
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

00:36:46.692 --> 00:36:49.092
He is the greatest yogi we have

00:36:49.252 --> 00:36:52.692
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

00:36:52.852 --> 00:36:58.972
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

00:36:59.132 --> 00:37:07.492
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

00:37:07.652 --> 00:37:10.372
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:12.492
and we should really worship him.

00:37:12.652 --> 00:37:15.302
Through him all deities are worshiped

00:37:15.462 --> 00:37:22.692
and are made happy and blissful.

00:37:22.852 --> 00:37:28.332
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

00:37:28.492 --> 00:37:33.612
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

00:37:33.772 --> 00:37:44.892
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

00:37:45.052 --> 00:37:49.532
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

00:37:49.692 --> 00:37:52.692
but you are dishonoring yourself

00:37:52.852 --> 00:37:56.292
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

00:37:56.452 --> 00:38:02.132
by becoming so sinful.

00:38:02.292 --> 00:38:05.772
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

00:38:05.932 --> 00:38:12.172
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

00:38:12.332 --> 00:38:15.812
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

00:38:15.972 --> 00:38:19.492
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

00:38:19.652 --> 00:38:23.572
Decency is very important in understanding,

00:38:23.732 --> 00:38:29.732
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

00:38:29.892 --> 00:38:36.252
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

00:38:36.412 --> 00:38:40.492
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:44.412
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:48.810
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:52.645
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

00:38:52.805 --> 00:38:58.581
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

00:38:58.741 --> 00:39:03.132
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

00:39:03.292 --> 00:39:08.035
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

00:39:08.195 --> 00:39:10.423
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:13.045
because men can develop so many diseases

00:39:13.205 --> 00:39:16.853
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

00:39:17.694 --> 00:39:24.749
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:28.108
because he is all the time repairing our body.

00:39:28.268 --> 00:39:31.953
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

00:39:32.113 --> 00:39:37.964
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

00:39:38.124 --> 00:39:40.877
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

00:39:41.037 --> 00:39:43.412
he is protecting our Kundalini.

00:39:43.572 --> 00:39:50.151
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

00:39:50.311 --> 00:39:55.909
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

00:39:56.069 --> 00:40:00.353
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

00:40:00.513 --> 00:40:04.532
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

00:40:04.692 --> 00:40:11.553
which is also a basis of your self realization.

00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:15.151
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

00:40:15.311 --> 00:40:18.088
and you should find out about yourself,

00:40:18.248 --> 00:40:22.867
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

00:40:23.027 --> 00:40:25.412
If we are; what are we doing about it?

00:40:25.572 --> 00:40:31.753
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

00:40:31.913 --> 00:40:34.675
You will not like them, will not like such people.

00:40:34.835 --> 00:40:37.957
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

00:40:38.117 --> 00:40:41.031
The children are the best as we know.

00:40:41.191 --> 00:40:48.618
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

00:40:48.778 --> 00:40:52.993
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

00:40:53.153 --> 00:40:56.488
He is the one who is really innocent

00:40:56.648 --> 00:41:00.896
but extremely, protective of you,

00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:04.530
very much protective, with his innocence.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.266
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:11.172
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

00:41:11.332 --> 00:41:14.016
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

00:41:14.176 --> 00:41:17.466
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

00:41:17.626 --> 00:41:22.687
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.012
people are talking about it that

00:41:25.172 --> 00:41:29.236
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

00:41:29.396 --> 00:41:32.591
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

00:41:32.751 --> 00:41:39.532
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

00:41:39.692 --> 00:41:44.250
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.060
In America, I was surprised to see that

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:50.972
there were so many Red Indians,

00:41:51.132 --> 00:41:54.972
who are called as Indian Americans.

00:41:55.132 --> 00:42:00.259
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

00:42:00.419 --> 00:42:04.570
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.372
I found the vibrations were so good.

00:42:07.532 --> 00:42:10.172
That means they were very innocent, simple people

00:42:10.332 --> 00:42:13.351
and Americans that time, who went there,

00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:16.372
tried to completely finish them.

00:42:16.532 --> 00:42:19.861
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

00:42:20.021 --> 00:42:23.612
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

00:42:23.772 --> 00:42:26.622
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

00:42:26.782 --> 00:42:30.492
still the people who live there or worked about

00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:35.793
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:40.526
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

00:42:40.686 --> 00:42:42.861
But they are so simple and innocent

00:42:43.021 --> 00:42:45.972
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

00:42:46.132 --> 00:42:48.772
because they used to worship the Mother.

00:42:48.932 --> 00:42:51.572
All the time they worship the Mother.

00:42:51.732 --> 00:42:55.332
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

00:42:55.492 --> 00:43:00.592
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

00:43:00.752 --> 00:43:03.552
They have many Maoris and all those people

00:43:03.712 --> 00:43:05.432
and they encourage all of them

00:43:05.592 --> 00:43:09.432
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

00:43:09.592 --> 00:43:16.675
and they are bringing them to this state to show

00:43:16.841 --> 00:43:21.548
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

00:43:21.708 --> 00:43:23.912
Its a very good venture.

00:43:24.072 --> 00:43:30.792
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

00:43:30.952 --> 00:43:35.611
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

00:43:35.771 --> 00:43:40.690
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.952
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

00:43:45.112 --> 00:43:46.352
from the mother earth.

00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:50.272
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

00:43:50.432 --> 00:43:57.592
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

00:43:57.752 --> 00:43:59.388
That’s what it is.

00:43:59.548 --> 00:44:04.228
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

00:44:04.388 --> 00:44:07.952
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.453
and Government also has never troubled us

00:44:10.613 --> 00:44:13.068
or there has been no problem with them.

00:44:13.228 --> 00:44:15.773
I don’t know what’s this helping them

00:44:15.933 --> 00:44:20.293
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

00:44:20.453 --> 00:44:24.742
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

00:44:24.902 --> 00:44:28.793
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

00:44:28.953 --> 00:44:31.043
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

00:44:31.203 --> 00:44:35.447
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

00:44:35.607 --> 00:44:37.731
You will be helped, miraculously

00:44:37.891 --> 00:44:43.102
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.125
May God Bless You.
