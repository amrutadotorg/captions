04:18.612 --> 04:28.012
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

04:29.692 --> 04:37.012
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

04:37.172 --> 04:42.351
His power comes from his innocence.

04:42.511 --> 04:47.153
When we see small children we are automatically

04:47.313 --> 04:50.772
compelled towards them

04:50.932 --> 04:58.292
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

04:58.452 --> 05:03.212
And very innocent they are,

05:04.492 --> 05:06.812
extremely innocent,

05:06.972 --> 05:13.332
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

05:13.492 --> 05:20.292
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

05:20.492 --> 05:27.172
These days people have become extremely cunning,

05:27.332 --> 05:30.972
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

05:31.132 --> 05:34.532
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

05:34.692 --> 05:38.572
who are innocent and simple.

05:38.732 --> 05:41.972
They can justify themselves always

05:42.132 --> 05:47.052
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

05:47.212 --> 05:50.332
when everybody is so cunning.

05:50.492 --> 06:00.572
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

06:00.772 --> 06:03.892
which is very much punishable,

06:04.172 --> 06:09.732
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

06:09.892 --> 06:13.732
which are physical, you can say.

06:14.092 --> 06:22.052
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

06:23.012 --> 06:26.252
Also, they can have other troubles

06:26.412 --> 06:29.932
with their liver treatments and all that.

06:30.092 --> 06:35.972
All this comes up. Then to punish them

06:36.132 --> 06:41.652
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

06:41.892 --> 06:45.052
At this time, when you have these problems,

06:45.212 --> 06:48.452
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

06:48.612 --> 06:51.492
should worship Shri Ganesha.

06:51.732 --> 06:59.052
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

06:59.212 --> 07:04.532
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

07:04.692 --> 07:08.732
extra work, I should say, than normal.

07:08.932 --> 07:13.452
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

07:13.612 --> 07:17.892
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

07:18.052 --> 07:25.372
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.172
One of the two things come up

07:28.332 --> 07:32.492
and he does not know where he is going.

07:32.652 --> 07:38.692
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

07:38.852 --> 07:43.332
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

07:43.492 --> 07:50.692
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

07:50.852 --> 07:54.049
All these diseases of the right side

07:54.209 --> 07:58.612
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

07:58.772 --> 08:04.572
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

08:05.572 --> 08:12.012
but there is a simple way to remember him

08:12.172 --> 08:17.572
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

08:17.732 --> 08:21.492
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

08:21.652 --> 08:26.412
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

08:26.572 --> 08:30.252
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

08:30.452 --> 08:35.132
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

08:35.292 --> 08:39.972
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

08:40.132 --> 08:44.932
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

08:45.092 --> 08:47.612
and all the worries from you.

08:47.772 --> 08:51.692
So this is the most important deity we have.

08:51.852 --> 08:55.052
Though its a very simple deity.

08:55.212 --> 08:58.732
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

08:58.892 --> 09:02.092
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

09:02.252 --> 09:10.772
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

09:10.932 --> 09:17.772
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.652
So to steady down these

09:20.812 --> 09:27.852
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

09:28.092 --> 09:35.052
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

09:35.252 --> 09:40.012
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

09:40.172 --> 09:44.172
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

09:44.332 --> 09:48.492
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

09:48.652 --> 09:53.892
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

09:54.052 --> 09:56.012
he never said who it was.

09:56.172 --> 10:00.972
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

10:01.132 --> 10:07.572
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

10:07.732 --> 10:10.452
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

10:10.612 --> 10:13.292
he used to go all out to fight it.

10:13.452 --> 10:15.412
Same is Shri Ganesha.

10:15.572 --> 10:20.492
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

10:20.652 --> 10:25.532
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

10:25.692 --> 10:28.852
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

10:29.012 --> 10:33.692
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

10:33.852 --> 10:38.132
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

10:38.292 --> 10:42.892
in different troubles and hurdles and also

10:43.052 --> 10:46.532
different type of very very difficult times.

10:46.692 --> 10:51.132
It is his style that he manages things so well

10:51.292 --> 10:53.972
because he is a Ganapati.

10:54.132 --> 11:00.092
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

11:00.252 --> 11:04.852
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

11:05.012 --> 11:13.012
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

11:13.172 --> 11:17.092
who report if there is any problem.

11:17.252 --> 11:21.372
They report to the brain that there is a problem

11:21.532 --> 11:28.172
and on the sternum bone is the residence

11:28.332 --> 11:33.972
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

11:34.132 --> 11:42.972
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

11:43.132 --> 11:46.692
sternum bone starts vibrating

11:46.852 --> 11:53.332
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

11:53.492 --> 11:57.492
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

11:57.652 --> 12:02.612
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

12:02.772 --> 12:06.732
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

12:06.892 --> 12:10.852
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

12:11.012 --> 12:13.652
are helped by Ganas is not true.

12:13.812 --> 12:17.132
Also the people who are mentally upset,

12:17.292 --> 12:22.012
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

12:22.172 --> 12:27.292
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

12:27.452 --> 12:32.372
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

12:32.532 --> 12:39.012
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

12:39.172 --> 12:43.812
Now his parents start crying for Mother

12:43.972 --> 12:47.932
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

12:48.092 --> 12:51.692
that they immediately rush to that place

12:51.852 --> 12:56.332
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

12:56.492 --> 13:00.092
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

13:00.252 --> 13:06.892
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.652
They are also small like him

13:10.812 --> 13:14.412
and they are very active and very alert.

13:14.572 --> 13:16.532
They never sleep.

13:16.692 --> 13:20.732
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

13:20.892 --> 13:25.732
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

13:25.892 --> 13:32.052
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.452
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

13:36.612 --> 13:40.772
For example there was a boy who got drowned

13:40.932 --> 13:47.172
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

13:47.332 --> 13:49.252
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

13:49.412 --> 13:51.972
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

13:52.132 --> 13:54.292
because there were children.

13:54.452 --> 13:57.012
So one boy fell down into that

13:57.172 --> 14:00.372
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

14:00.532 --> 14:02.492
Nobody knew he was there.

14:02.652 --> 14:08.172
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

14:08.332 --> 14:11.892
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

14:12.052 --> 14:16.852
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

14:17.012 --> 14:20.532
After that they got so frightened

14:20.692 --> 14:24.292
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

14:24.452 --> 14:26.972
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

14:27.132 --> 14:29.402
I didn’t know even the address.

14:29.562 --> 14:33.972
But I asked to telephone to this number,

14:34.132 --> 14:37.052
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

14:37.212 --> 14:42.812
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

14:42.972 --> 14:46.052
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

14:46.212 --> 14:47.772
and he will be saved.

14:47.932 --> 14:49.932
Nobody had told me anything.

14:50.092 --> 14:52.692
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

14:52.852 --> 14:57.532
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

14:57.692 --> 15:01.572
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

15:01.732 --> 15:04.252
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

15:04.412 --> 15:07.292
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

15:07.452 --> 15:09.892
If there is one chance of his surviving,

15:10.052 --> 15:14.972
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

15:15.132 --> 15:18.092
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.172
So, like this, so many things happen

15:20.332 --> 15:26.292
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

15:26.452 --> 15:29.892
your blessings that this has happened.

15:30.052 --> 15:32.892
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

15:33.052 --> 15:35.492
but because of Shri Ganesha.

15:35.652 --> 15:38.132
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

15:38.292 --> 15:41.652
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

15:41.812 --> 15:47.652
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

15:47.812 --> 15:51.252
To him his Mother is everything.

15:51.412 --> 15:54.412
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

15:54.572 --> 16:00.092
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

16:00.252 --> 16:07.612
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

16:07.772 --> 16:12.372
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

16:12.532 --> 16:17.932
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

16:18.092 --> 16:21.252
but His work is tremendous.

16:21.412 --> 16:26.132
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

16:26.292 --> 16:32.052
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

16:32.212 --> 16:35.892
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

16:36.052 --> 16:42.172
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

16:42.332 --> 16:46.852
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

16:47.012 --> 16:49.452
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

16:49.612 --> 16:52.612
Its not only in women but also in men,

16:52.772 --> 16:55.932
he expects chastity to be present.

16:56.092 --> 17:01.292
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

17:01.452 --> 17:04.692
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

17:04.852 --> 17:10.772
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

17:10.932 --> 17:15.092
of communicating with young women and young men

17:15.252 --> 17:18.012
and spoiling your chastity.

17:18.172 --> 17:21.012
Even your eyes should be clean,

17:21.172 --> 17:23.692
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

17:23.852 --> 17:27.772
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

17:27.932 --> 17:30.372
what mistakes you have committed

17:30.532 --> 17:37.372
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

17:37.532 --> 17:42.812
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

17:42.972 --> 17:46.332
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

17:46.492 --> 17:50.732
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

17:50.892 --> 17:53.532
but that is a very important thing.

17:53.692 --> 17:58.852
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.572
We should be very chaste.

18:00.732 --> 18:04.772
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

18:04.932 --> 18:08.572
But religions have become so useless now,

18:08.732 --> 18:12.012
have become without any basis,

18:12.172 --> 18:22.692
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

18:22.852 --> 18:26.252
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

18:26.412 --> 18:30.612
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

18:30.772 --> 18:33.812
Actually the religions have failed completely

18:33.972 --> 18:38.812
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

18:38.972 --> 18:41.092
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

18:41.252 --> 18:44.452
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

18:44.612 --> 18:48.132
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

18:48.292 --> 18:54.972
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

18:55.132 --> 18:59.932
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

19:00.092 --> 19:06.692
and where people are also having very bad morals.

19:06.852 --> 19:11.492
He creates problems for them. What happens that

19:11.652 --> 19:18.532
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

19:18.692 --> 19:21.076
Earthquake takes place in places where

19:21.236 --> 19:24.892
there is no respect of chastity,

19:25.052 --> 19:28.892
also where there are fundamentalist

19:29.052 --> 19:35.892
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

19:36.052 --> 19:40.812
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.252
So the Mother earth also understands.

19:43.412 --> 19:46.852
Now we have so many earthquakes,

19:47.012 --> 19:49.292
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

19:49.452 --> 19:52.452
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

19:52.612 --> 19:54.372
So he protects them.

19:54.532 --> 19:59.252
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

19:59.412 --> 20:01.452
he tries to destroy them,

20:01.612 --> 20:05.572
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

20:05.732 --> 20:16.492
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

20:16.652 --> 20:19.372
he attracts people towards himself,

20:19.532 --> 20:24.372
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

20:24.532 --> 20:29.172
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

20:29.332 --> 20:34.852
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

20:35.012 --> 20:38.052
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

20:38.212 --> 20:41.772
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

20:41.932 --> 20:46.532
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

20:46.692 --> 20:50.252
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

20:50.412 --> 20:56.932
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

20:57.092 --> 21:01.852
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

21:02.012 --> 21:06.412
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

21:06.572 --> 21:08.732
they go back to their own place.

21:08.892 --> 21:12.092
So going back to the same place is only possible

21:12.252 --> 21:15.092
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

21:15.252 --> 21:19.532
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

21:19.692 --> 21:23.652
also they are bound by their own qualities.

21:23.812 --> 21:28.692
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

21:28.852 --> 21:31.092
and a lion will be a lion.

21:31.252 --> 21:34.852
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

21:35.012 --> 21:37.132
So they could be anything, you can’t say

21:37.292 --> 21:41.172
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

21:41.332 --> 21:43.932
And once they become anything like that

21:44.092 --> 21:48.692
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

21:48.852 --> 21:51.252
when they are human beings.

21:51.412 --> 21:56.012
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

21:56.172 --> 22:01.092
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

22:01.252 --> 22:05.572
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

22:05.732 --> 22:10.572
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

22:10.732 --> 22:13.652
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

22:13.812 --> 22:18.252
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

22:18.412 --> 22:26.092
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

22:26.252 --> 22:28.292
Before the statue they dance

22:28.452 --> 22:34.852
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

22:35.012 --> 22:40.532
music from some very funny films or something.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.652
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

22:43.812 --> 22:47.932
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

22:48.092 --> 22:52.292
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

22:52.452 --> 22:54.732
and they were dancing before it.

22:54.892 --> 23:00.492
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

23:00.652 --> 23:04.932
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

23:05.092 --> 23:09.452
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

23:09.612 --> 23:13.092
At that time the earth moved

23:13.252 --> 23:22.852
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

23:23.012 --> 23:25.332
They all disappeared into earth.

23:25.492 --> 23:28.652
Apart from that there were many others also

23:28.812 --> 23:33.052
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.892
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

23:37.052 --> 23:44.652
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

23:44.812 --> 23:50.732
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

23:50.892 --> 23:56.012
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

23:56.172 --> 24:05.292
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

24:05.452 --> 24:10.412
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

24:10.732 --> 24:12.892
They were all right.

24:13.052 --> 24:18.012
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

24:18.172 --> 24:20.688
and this is how they saved the Ashram

24:20.848 --> 24:23.652
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

24:23.812 --> 24:28.052
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

24:28.212 --> 24:31.972
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

24:32.132 --> 24:34.612
So we must respect his Ganas,

24:34.772 --> 24:39.372
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

24:39.532 --> 24:41.572
they are acting within us.

24:41.732 --> 24:44.892
They see us what sort of person you are,

24:45.052 --> 24:49.812
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

24:49.972 --> 24:51.975
by your misbehavior

24:52.135 --> 24:56.412
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

24:56.572 --> 24:58.572
They give you a chance many a times.

24:58.732 --> 25:06.212
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

25:06.372 --> 25:12.932
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

25:13.092 --> 25:17.012
I should say, calamity for you people.

25:17.172 --> 25:19.772
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

25:19.932 --> 25:23.172
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

25:23.332 --> 25:28.732
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

25:28.892 --> 25:31.932
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

25:32.092 --> 25:34.612
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

25:34.772 --> 25:41.172
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

25:41.332 --> 25:46.132
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

25:46.292 --> 25:49.012
so we are not at all helped by this.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.892
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

25:52.052 --> 25:55.812
don’t do any worship of any idol

25:55.972 --> 25:59.692
because these idols have been created by human beings

25:59.852 --> 26:04.492
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.972
They are not created by the mother earth

26:07.132 --> 26:09.891
but are copied by people

26:10.051 --> 26:13.532
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

26:13.692 --> 26:17.332
So that’s, how any idol you get,

26:17.492 --> 26:23.612
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

26:23.772 --> 26:26.972
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

26:27.132 --> 26:29.812
So whatever is not there,

26:29.972 --> 26:34.012
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

26:34.172 --> 26:37.612
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

26:37.772 --> 26:41.732
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

26:41.892 --> 26:45.132
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

26:45.292 --> 26:48.172
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

26:48.332 --> 26:52.972
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

26:53.132 --> 26:57.012
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

26:57.172 --> 27:03.492
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

27:03.652 --> 27:08.892
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

27:09.052 --> 27:13.172
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

27:13.332 --> 27:17.852
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

27:18.012 --> 27:22.772
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

27:22.932 --> 27:25.972
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

27:26.132 --> 27:29.172
and how he is doing this to us.”

27:29.332 --> 27:35.692
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

27:35.852 --> 27:41.932
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

27:42.092 --> 27:43.452
And then he realized it.

27:43.612 --> 27:46.292
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

27:46.452 --> 27:51.732
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

27:51.892 --> 27:56.172
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

27:56.332 --> 27:58.852
and being very cunning and clever.

27:59.012 --> 28:03.572
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

28:03.732 --> 28:11.012
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

28:11.172 --> 28:16.532
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

28:16.692 --> 28:21.772
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

28:21.932 --> 28:25.052
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

28:25.212 --> 28:27.972
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

28:28.132 --> 28:34.372
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

28:34.532 --> 28:37.612
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

28:37.772 --> 28:43.292
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

28:43.452 --> 28:50.332
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

28:50.492 --> 28:58.732
that he can move mountains after mountains.

28:58.892 --> 29:05.292
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

29:05.452 --> 29:12.612
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

29:12.772 --> 29:15.892
can be changed.

29:16.812 --> 29:21.612
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

29:21.772 --> 29:23.852
of the right direction.

29:24.012 --> 29:29.892
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

29:30.052 --> 29:34.452
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

29:34.612 --> 29:37.972
it was the right type and he was successful.

29:38.132 --> 29:41.132
But then what happened, they had stencils

29:41.292 --> 29:43.892
and they started using it from the other side.

29:44.052 --> 29:47.172
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

29:47.332 --> 29:50.452
and then they were all destroyed.

29:50.612 --> 29:54.572
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

29:54.732 --> 29:56.820
Also we have proved now

29:56.980 --> 30:00.932
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

30:01.092 --> 30:04.652
is actually from the Carbon atom.

30:04.812 --> 30:07.372
The carbon atom has got Swastika

30:07.532 --> 30:14.332
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

30:14.492 --> 30:16.372
all put in series.

30:16.532 --> 30:21.692
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

30:21.852 --> 30:24.412
look at it from the left side to right side,

30:24.572 --> 30:28.412
what you see is Omkar.

30:28.572 --> 30:31.212
If you see it from right side to left side,

30:31.372 --> 30:32.972
you see the Swastika,

30:33.132 --> 30:39.852
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

30:40.012 --> 30:45.212
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

30:45.372 --> 30:50.052
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

30:50.212 --> 30:53.652
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

30:53.812 --> 30:57.732
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

30:57.892 --> 31:01.052
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

31:01.212 --> 31:05.812
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

31:05.972 --> 31:10.012
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

31:10.172 --> 31:11.772
because we are confused.

31:11.932 --> 31:14.052
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

31:14.212 --> 31:16.092
that this is already written there.

31:16.252 --> 31:21.692
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

31:21.852 --> 31:29.092
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

31:29.252 --> 31:35.372
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

31:35.532 --> 31:38.372
All the things I have told you about Christ,

31:38.532 --> 31:44.852
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

31:45.012 --> 31:48.012
Like Christ had these two fingers,

31:48.172 --> 31:52.492
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

31:52.652 --> 31:57.132
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

31:57.292 --> 32:01.012
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

32:01.172 --> 32:04.692
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

32:04.852 --> 32:07.452
only these two fingers why did he use.

32:07.612 --> 32:10.277
Pointing out towards his father

32:10.437 --> 32:14.352
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

32:14.692 --> 32:17.932
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

32:18.092 --> 32:21.412
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

32:21.572 --> 32:28.252
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

32:28.412 --> 32:33.812
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

32:33.972 --> 32:37.972
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

32:38.132 --> 32:39.908
So it all opens out

32:40.068 --> 32:45.484
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

32:45.652 --> 32:49.612
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

32:49.772 --> 32:54.892
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

32:55.052 --> 32:59.052
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

32:59.212 --> 33:01.012
You are no more cunning.

33:01.172 --> 33:07.732
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

33:07.892 --> 33:12.972
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

33:13.132 --> 33:18.132
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

33:18.292 --> 33:25.092
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

33:25.252 --> 33:29.972
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

33:30.132 --> 33:34.332
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

33:34.492 --> 33:37.532
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

33:37.692 --> 33:43.743
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

33:43.903 --> 33:47.663
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

33:47.823 --> 33:51.252
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

33:51.412 --> 33:53.412
We don’t look after the mother earth.

33:53.572 --> 33:56.892
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

33:57.052 --> 34:01.012
Actually in Indian culture it is that

34:01.172 --> 34:04.172
when you are getting up in the morning,

34:04.332 --> 34:09.252
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

34:09.412 --> 34:13.692
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

34:13.852 --> 34:16.932
because I am touching you with my feet.

34:17.092 --> 34:19.412
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

34:19.572 --> 34:21.292
then you won’t exploit it,

34:21.452 --> 34:25.052
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

34:25.212 --> 34:28.052
It all comes out of our ignorance

34:28.212 --> 34:32.612
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

34:32.772 --> 34:36.452
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

34:36.612 --> 34:41.092
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

34:41.252 --> 34:44.172
what is to be done.

34:44.332 --> 34:47.252
The mother earth itself we should look after,

34:47.412 --> 34:51.012
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

34:51.172 --> 34:53.412
we can do all kinds of things

34:53.572 --> 34:59.092
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

34:59.252 --> 35:03.932
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

35:04.092 --> 35:07.172
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

35:07.332 --> 35:11.892
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

35:12.052 --> 35:13.932
is a very wrong thing.

35:14.092 --> 35:17.692
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

35:17.852 --> 35:19.852
you should put another one there.

35:20.012 --> 35:23.372
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

35:23.532 --> 35:27.972
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

35:28.132 --> 35:35.572
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

35:35.732 --> 35:38.932
I don’t know how they live but they do

35:39.092 --> 35:45.092
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

35:45.252 --> 35:49.132
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

35:49.292 --> 35:55.172
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

35:55.332 --> 35:58.332
that it should get the sunrays.

35:58.492 --> 36:00.052
There is no quarrel about it.

36:00.212 --> 36:03.852
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

36:04.012 --> 36:09.132
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.492
The animals also don’t destroy,

36:11.652 --> 36:14.692
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

36:14.852 --> 36:18.532
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

36:18.692 --> 36:21.172
do not destroy anything

36:21.332 --> 36:27.212
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

36:27.372 --> 36:30.492
Whatever may be the cry for this,

36:30.652 --> 36:34.412
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

36:34.572 --> 36:37.412
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

36:37.572 --> 36:41.532
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

36:41.692 --> 36:46.532
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

36:46.692 --> 36:49.092
He is the greatest yogi we have

36:49.252 --> 36:52.692
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

36:52.852 --> 36:58.972
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

36:59.132 --> 37:07.492
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

37:07.652 --> 37:10.372
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

37:10.532 --> 37:12.492
and we should really worship him.

37:12.652 --> 37:15.302
Through him all deities are worshiped

37:15.462 --> 37:22.692
and are made happy and blissful.

37:22.852 --> 37:28.332
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

37:28.492 --> 37:33.612
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

37:33.772 --> 37:44.892
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

37:45.052 --> 37:49.532
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

37:49.692 --> 37:52.692
but you are dishonoring yourself

37:52.852 --> 37:56.292
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

37:56.452 --> 38:02.132
by becoming so sinful.

38:02.292 --> 38:05.772
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

38:05.932 --> 38:12.172
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.812
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

38:15.972 --> 38:19.492
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

38:19.652 --> 38:23.572
Decency is very important in understanding,

38:23.732 --> 38:29.732
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

38:29.892 --> 38:36.252
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

38:36.412 --> 38:40.492
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

38:40.652 --> 38:44.412
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

38:44.572 --> 38:48.810
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

38:48.970 --> 38:52.645
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

38:52.805 --> 38:58.581
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

38:58.741 --> 39:03.132
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

39:03.292 --> 39:08.035
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

39:08.195 --> 39:10.423
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

39:10.583 --> 39:13.045
because men can develop so many diseases

39:13.205 --> 39:16.853
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

39:17.694 --> 39:24.749
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

39:24.909 --> 39:28.108
because he is all the time repairing our body.

39:28.268 --> 39:31.953
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

39:32.113 --> 39:37.964
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

39:38.124 --> 39:40.877
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

39:41.037 --> 39:43.412
he is protecting our Kundalini.

39:43.572 --> 39:50.151
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

39:50.311 --> 39:55.909
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

39:56.069 --> 40:00.353
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

40:00.513 --> 40:04.532
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

40:04.692 --> 40:11.553
which is also a basis of your self realization.

40:11.713 --> 40:15.151
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

40:15.311 --> 40:18.088
and you should find out about yourself,

40:18.248 --> 40:22.867
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

40:23.027 --> 40:25.412
If we are; what are we doing about it?

40:25.572 --> 40:31.753
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

40:31.913 --> 40:34.675
You will not like them, will not like such people.

40:34.835 --> 40:37.957
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

40:38.117 --> 40:41.031
The children are the best as we know.

40:41.191 --> 40:48.618
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

40:48.778 --> 40:52.993
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

40:53.153 --> 40:56.488
He is the one who is really innocent

40:56.648 --> 41:00.896
but extremely, protective of you,

41:01.056 --> 41:04.530
very much protective, with his innocence.

41:04.690 --> 41:07.266
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

41:07.426 --> 41:11.172
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

41:11.332 --> 41:14.016
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

41:14.176 --> 41:17.466
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

41:17.626 --> 41:22.687
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

41:22.847 --> 41:25.012
people are talking about it that

41:25.172 --> 41:29.236
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

41:29.396 --> 41:32.591
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

41:32.751 --> 41:39.532
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

41:39.692 --> 41:44.250
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

41:44.410 --> 41:48.060
In America, I was surprised to see that

41:48.220 --> 41:50.972
there were so many Red Indians,

41:51.132 --> 41:54.972
who are called as Indian Americans.

41:55.132 --> 42:00.259
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

42:00.419 --> 42:04.570
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

42:04.730 --> 42:07.372
I found the vibrations were so good.

42:07.532 --> 42:10.172
That means they were very innocent, simple people

42:10.332 --> 42:13.351
and Americans that time, who went there,

42:13.511 --> 42:16.372
tried to completely finish them.

42:16.532 --> 42:19.861
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

42:20.021 --> 42:23.612
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

42:23.772 --> 42:26.622
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

42:26.782 --> 42:30.492
still the people who live there or worked about

42:30.652 --> 42:35.793
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

42:35.953 --> 42:40.526
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

42:40.686 --> 42:42.861
But they are so simple and innocent

42:43.021 --> 42:45.972
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

42:46.132 --> 42:48.772
because they used to worship the Mother.

42:48.932 --> 42:51.572
All the time they worship the Mother.

42:51.732 --> 42:55.332
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

42:55.492 --> 43:00.592
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

43:00.752 --> 43:03.552
They have many Maoris and all those people

43:03.712 --> 43:05.432
and they encourage all of them

43:05.592 --> 43:09.432
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

43:09.592 --> 43:16.675
and they are bringing them to this state to show

43:16.841 --> 43:21.548
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

43:21.708 --> 43:23.912
Its a very good venture.

43:24.072 --> 43:30.792
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

43:30.952 --> 43:35.611
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

43:35.771 --> 43:40.690
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

43:40.850 --> 43:44.952
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

43:45.112 --> 43:46.352
from the mother earth.

43:46.512 --> 43:50.272
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

43:50.432 --> 43:57.592
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

43:57.752 --> 43:59.388
That’s what it is.

43:59.548 --> 44:04.228
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

44:04.388 --> 44:07.952
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

44:08.112 --> 44:10.453
and Government also has never troubled us

44:10.613 --> 44:13.068
or there has been no problem with them.

44:13.228 --> 44:15.773
I don’t know what’s this helping them

44:15.933 --> 44:20.293
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

44:20.453 --> 44:24.742
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

44:24.902 --> 44:28.793
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

44:28.953 --> 44:31.043
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

44:31.203 --> 44:35.447
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

44:35.607 --> 44:37.731
You will be helped, miraculously

44:37.891 --> 44:43.102
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

44:43.300 --> 44:45.125
May God Bless You.
