00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:13.802
Seeker: I was a bit hippie-like or
a freak, as we called it.

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:20.669
I was not interested in society as such

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.479
or to live a conventional life.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:33.887
But I also didn't have definite ideas
what I could do otherwise.

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:38.463
I was that kind of person that
neglected everything,

00:00:38.463 --> 00:00:41.354
but without having constructive
alternatives.

00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:49.828
Shri Mataji: You're better? Better now.
You are going to be alright, quite right.

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:51.933
Become a master yourself.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.535
Seeker: That time I lived in Munich 
and I remember well

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:59.840
That within 2 years, the whole English
garden was clothed in red

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.987
and hundreds of sanyasiis were
running around.

00:01:03.987 --> 00:01:12.628
People called Hans, Franz or Ulli before,
were suddenly called Anand or Shravanu

00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:19.598
I believe for sure, that this was
a sign of my generation

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:24.607
and that a lot of people were
interested in Spirituality.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:31.404
Shri Mataji: Is that alright?
Understand now?

00:01:32.974 --> 00:01:38.564
I think, that a lot of people are
still seeking

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:42.991
but I think, they feel more comfortable
with seeking than with finding.

00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.420
Seeking always keeps all options open,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.820
you don't have to fully commit yourself.
