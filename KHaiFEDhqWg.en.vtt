00:34.324 --> 00:43.564
In India two Navratris of Devi are observed.

00:43.589 --> 00:54.101
Chaitra Navratri in which today's day is called Shaila Putri.

00:54.126 --> 01:02.495
Shailaputri means when She had first taken birth in Shivalaya.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.650
So, She is called Shaila Putri

01:07.087 --> 01:11.827
and in this there are many other names of Hers.

01:12.168 --> 01:16.965
But the significance of Shaila Putri is that

01:16.990 --> 01:21.981
Her first birth took place in the form of Shaila Putri.

01:24.097 --> 01:36.151
So, in that cold climate of Himalayas birth of Mary took place and

01:38.301 --> 01:44.409
whatever She had to achieve, was limited to that Shailaputri form.

01:48.400 --> 01:55.760
But further story you already know that

02:00.220 --> 02:07.351
Dakhsa organized a Havana.

02:08.044 --> 02:12.643
He didn't invite Shivji in that Havana.

02:12.668 --> 02:14.153
She was Shivji's wife.

02:16.483 --> 02:23.089
Then Devi, She is called Sati.

02:24.645 --> 02:29.945
She gave Her AHUTI in HAVANKUND.(immolated Herself in fire)

02:31.302 --> 02:38.951
Shivji came and picked Her body and left.

02:39.109 --> 02:46.318
Her parts of body fell at various places

02:46.343 --> 02:49.862
and at those places we believe is Devi's power

02:49.887 --> 02:51.509
as it is in Vindyachal.

02:51.534 --> 02:53.255
It is everywhere.

02:53.933 --> 02:57.115
Her power acts there

03:02.345 --> 03:17.750
and that power used to purify everything. it was so destructive.

03:17.775 --> 03:24.655
because the seven powers which came along with that are not destructive.

03:25.766 --> 03:33.516
After this, destructive power that came was right sided.

03:38.593 --> 03:46.288
For example, in the right side are Savitri, Gayatri.

03:48.177 --> 03:54.210
But the effect of destructive power was that

03:54.235 --> 04:00.212
one direction went to the left the other to the right

04:00.237 --> 04:07.394
and the destrutive power went to the center.

04:07.512 --> 04:12.337
In that you see that Devi has many forms.

04:12.362 --> 04:20.271
There is Heart chakra for example Durga and many other forms

04:20.496 --> 04:23.274
with the help of which She protects.

04:23.299 --> 04:25.490
She is settled in Heart.

04:25.515 --> 04:30.909
She resides in our Heart.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.782
So one power of Heart chakra is already there

04:36.901 --> 04:47.835
that if somebody bothers you or attacks you

04:47.860 --> 04:54.165
or puts you in confusion

04:54.443 --> 04:59.858
Shakti in your heart will protect you

04:59.883 --> 05:04.523
and he who bothers you, will destroy him.

05:07.180 --> 05:14.006
There the greatest of Shakti (what should we say)

05:14.553 --> 05:24.257
its effectiveness is there because of the presence of Kundalini

05:24.282 --> 05:27.772
When kundalini comes to Heart chakra

05:27.955 --> 05:31.668
because Kundalini is Jagdamba, it is Amba

05:31.935 --> 05:36.697
when it comes there, its this power multiplies more.

05:37.244 --> 05:41.212
So when a human being accepts Sahajyoga

05:41.237 --> 05:43.775
and with the help of Kundalini awakening

05:44.155 --> 05:47.954
this powers settles in his heart

05:48.151 --> 05:56.484
it manages you properly and protects you fully.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.277
No one can harm you.

05:59.302 --> 06:01.344
But you should place Her in your heart.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.894
You should place Mother in your heart.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.714
This is the power of Mother, power of Motherhood.

06:07.236 --> 06:10.010
And the power of Motherhood is such that

06:10.035 --> 06:18.041
it always protects her children.

06:18.748 --> 06:19.748
Always protects.

06:21.668 --> 06:27.679
That is why, whenever we are disturbed

06:27.719 --> 06:31.262
in medical terminology it is said that the

06:31.302 --> 06:33.843
bone here (Shree Mataji points to Her center heart) starts shaking.

06:34.340 --> 06:36.873
and because of that

06:36.898 --> 06:44.497
the antibodies spread all around called Gannas in our language.

06:45.180 --> 06:49.177
These Gannas get the message and they get ready instantly.

06:50.508 --> 06:53.678
She is the Maharagini, the Queen of Gannas also

06:54.130 --> 07:01.400
and they act on their command.

07:02.458 --> 07:07.649
And between them, for example Ganesh and Devi

07:07.674 --> 07:13.085
question of quarrel doesn't arise ever.

07:13.686 --> 07:16.157
There is no question of unpleasantness between them.

07:16.682 --> 07:20.360
Both these powers are in oneness with their Mother.

07:20.385 --> 07:26.522
Ganesha is Her son and She is His Mother.

07:26.565 --> 07:30.105
Those who recognize Ganeshji

07:30.130 --> 07:34.763
and those who have established Him within, specially in Sahaj

07:34.788 --> 07:38.303
She takes care of them just like Her children.

07:38.730 --> 07:42.210
At every step and every where She looks after them

07:42.235 --> 07:45.789
because She is Mother and you are Ganesha.

07:46.173 --> 07:48.374
But your Ganesha should be Nirmal (pure).

07:48.399 --> 07:56.664
If there is anything wrong with your Ganesha, She corrects them.

07:56.688 --> 07:59.714
In this way she accomplishes various types of activities.

07:59.739 --> 08:02.266
But today's significance is that

08:02.667 --> 08:09.513
it is said that when She first of all took birth as Shaila putri

08:09.538 --> 08:18.668
and this would happen in Satyuga

08:18.693 --> 08:20.961
but before that

08:23.612 --> 08:25.813
when Adishakti incarnated in the universe

08:26.273 --> 08:31.253
She took birth in the form of a cow.

08:32.920 --> 08:47.057
And in one way, we say there is a dewelling of paramchaitanya

08:47.082 --> 08:51.046
there She incarnated

08:51.071 --> 08:55.965
in the form of a cow.

08:57.833 --> 09:04.006
The question is that there first of all Gokul was established

09:05.734 --> 09:07.477
and there is that cow.

09:07.502 --> 09:09.539
Everything was first of all created

09:09.564 --> 09:12.977
and its reflection is within us.

09:13.002 --> 09:18.616
For example, Sadashiv was reflected as Shree Shiva.

09:20.823 --> 09:22.953
Reflections of all came (into our being)

09:22.978 --> 09:26.771
and like that came that of Devi also.

09:26.843 --> 09:31.008
So when Devi's incarnation took place

09:31.033 --> 09:36.172
when She took birth first in the form of a human being

09:36.197 --> 09:39.601
She is reflected as Shailaputri. So today is a very important day.

09:40.673 --> 09:45.910
But in that situation about which I am telling you

09:45.935 --> 09:49.759
which you say is the arrangement of Paramchaitanya

09:49.784 --> 09:51.855
you may call heaven or whatever you may say

09:52.704 --> 10:01.189
there She took birth as Adishakti.

10:01.214 --> 10:03.531
She was in the form of a cow.

10:03.556 --> 10:07.550
That is why we do not kill a cow, because She is Mother.

10:08.335 --> 10:12.081
There is a lot of difference between an Indian cow and a foreign cow.

10:12.106 --> 10:14.628
They look totally different.

10:15.207 --> 10:20.662
I remember, My grand daughters were small

10:20.687 --> 10:23.521
and used to ask Me,"Nanee (Grand Mother)

10:23.546 --> 10:25.826
why are the buffalos here white?"

10:26.117 --> 10:30.142
There is no difference between the expression of cows and buffalos.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.964
Both are just the same.

10:32.847 --> 10:39.060
Now that was not the time for Adishakti to give birth.

10:40.776 --> 10:47.320
because earlier as you know were DWAPAR,TRETA YUGA.

10:47.390 --> 10:49.271
She had to come in Kaliyuga only

10:49.296 --> 10:56.623
because She had to come with all the chakras and all the Goddesses

10:56.648 --> 11:00.447
With all the Shaktis (powers) She had to come in Kaliyuga

11:00.472 --> 11:02.415
otherwise this work could not have been done.

11:02.543 --> 11:04.657
It was such GHOR Kaliyuga (Most Intense and frightful time.)

11:04.682 --> 11:07.601
In this GHOR Kaliyuga it was difficult to do the work.

11:08.514 --> 11:11.795
and it had to be in the Mahamaya swarupa.

11:11.820 --> 11:13.808
Because in GHOR Kaliyuga

11:13.833 --> 11:16.881
if anybody came to know that She is Adishakti

11:16.912 --> 11:18.674
they would run to kill her.

11:18.702 --> 11:22.979
So, She came as Mahamaya.

11:24.246 --> 11:31.453
The earlier swarupa was not like Mahamaya swarupa.

11:33.119 --> 11:35.631
It was in Her original form, overall glamourous.

11:35.656 --> 11:41.437
Because in those days there was no such thing

11:41.528 --> 11:45.515
that anybody could kill Devi.

11:45.540 --> 11:48.850
That time was different, as they say

11:49.031 --> 11:53.624
and that too Her birth took place in the lap of Himalayas

11:53.900 --> 11:56.292
and after that Her marriage with Shree Shiva

11:56.317 --> 11:59.454
who was all powerful and Almighty.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.932
Often people have this question

12:03.957 --> 12:07.049
that this is one Navratri and there is another Navratri

12:08.686 --> 12:12.975
and for Devi they say, one is Mahakali and another is Mahasaraswati

12:13.316 --> 12:20.208
All of them are there but they are all part and parcel of Adishakti.

12:20.248 --> 12:25.435
and now the manifestation that took place

12:25.460 --> 12:32.132
that too happened at such a time that this work had to be done.

12:33.037 --> 12:36.347
For example, the existance of Shakamberi Devi in Meerut

12:36.372 --> 12:39.209
the manifestation of Shakambari Devi took place.

12:40.069 --> 12:45.943
She had the power to increase agricultural production

12:46.276 --> 12:51.318
When we too were in Meerut we cultivated lot of agriculture

12:51.779 --> 12:54.830
such big brinjals which could not be carried

12:55.100 --> 12:59.603
such big tomatoes and such long and thick cucumbers

12:59.634 --> 13:01.780
People could not understand at that time how it happened..

13:01.805 --> 13:04.857
We got five or six prizes

13:06.505 --> 13:09.397
It is the power of Shakambari Devi.

13:09.422 --> 13:14.140
So at a place, whichever power of the Devi exists

13:14.228 --> 13:19.268
there whichever Shakti is present does the maximum work.

13:26.053 --> 13:28.982
Everybody used to get confused in that.

13:30.103 --> 13:33.072
But Shakti has different forms.

13:33.097 --> 13:36.259
And whichever and whenever She needs, She uses.

13:37.260 --> 13:44.010
It is not like this that this is Durga and who is this Chamunda.

13:44.705 --> 13:45.541
It is not like that

13:45.566 --> 13:49.105
She is all the forms together and all Her forms are necessary.

13:49.455 --> 13:55.043
Because individual Devtas work like this

13:55.157 --> 13:57.144
Devi is Shakti swarupa

13:57.930 --> 14:02.771
and without Devi no incarnation can do any work.

14:02.796 --> 14:13.959
He may be a Guru or an incarnation like Rama or Krishna or Christ.

14:14.309 --> 14:17.703
Behind all of them is Devi's Shakti.

14:18.336 --> 14:23.014
That is why in our country Mother is respected by everyone.

14:23.039 --> 14:28.364
Indians are actually the worshippers of Shakti.

14:28.389 --> 14:32.819
As such they quarrel among themselves

14:32.844 --> 14:35.870
but in reality everybody is the worshipper of Shakti.

14:35.895 --> 14:38.765
Those who worship Vishnu also worship Shakti

14:38.790 --> 14:41.138
those who are the worshippers of Shiva also worship Shakti

14:41.210 --> 14:44.860
because nobody can divide Mother.

14:45.594 --> 14:49.193
There is such a big institution of Mother in our country.

14:49.218 --> 14:54.465
And we should respect Her.

14:54.490 --> 14:58.035
Mother and children both should respect (each other).

14:58.060 --> 15:02.126
Till now women in our country are not so much spoilt.

15:02.151 --> 15:08.750
But they do not understand that to be a mother

15:08.775 --> 15:12.828
which qualities they should have to enrich themselves

15:12.853 --> 15:15.947
so that they have good children.

15:16.961 --> 15:22.248
Now a days because women are getting involved in other affairs

15:22.273 --> 15:24.648
they don't produce children

15:26.930 --> 15:30.140
because why should such women have children?

15:30.165 --> 15:35.393
and in other countries where mothers are not good

15:35.418 --> 15:36.913
there children don't take birth.

15:37.933 --> 15:39.332
In Germany the population growth is minus.

15:39.357 --> 15:41.763
In America it is minus. All Whites are minus.

15:41.788 --> 15:45.807
Why it is so at all such places?

15:45.847 --> 15:48.564
The reason is that there is no quality of motherhood.

15:48.644 --> 15:50.722
Now by and by they have understood all this.

15:50.747 --> 15:52.467
Where there are no motherhood qualities

15:52.506 --> 15:55.782
Children are born, but they take birth at such places

15:55.807 --> 15:58.806
where they get love and are taken care of.

15:58.831 --> 16:04.872
Along with that I think that Indian husbands

16:07.129 --> 16:12.219
should know how to respect and love their women.

16:12.244 --> 16:14.653
This is very important

16:14.678 --> 16:18.639
because it is possible that after some time

16:18.694 --> 16:21.638
people all over the world may recognize coming to India

16:21.663 --> 16:22.755
as their supreme aim

16:22.780 --> 16:24.549
they want to understand everything.

16:24.647 --> 16:33.084
But the state of women here, especially in North India, is very sad.

16:33.109 --> 16:36.707
Respecting women is considered as a great sin.

16:37.406 --> 16:41.473
Beating them up, and demanding dowry is a  common practice.

16:41.498 --> 16:46.567
In many ways, man wants to show his superiority to a woman.

16:46.592 --> 16:47.922
He is not.

16:48.081 --> 16:51.214
A man is superior in his own capacity.

16:51.564 --> 16:54.943
But he doesn't have the strength of a woman.

16:54.967 --> 16:58.132
He doesn't have the power to produce a child.

16:58.265 --> 17:00.976
Those who do not respect women

17:01.286 --> 17:03.744
those countries also lead to destruction.

17:03.769 --> 17:07.313
And those who do not respect Mother also lead to destruction.

17:07.509 --> 17:09.355
because their Shakti gets exhausted.

17:09.380 --> 17:14.678
It should not happen that they run after women.

17:14.703 --> 17:16.722
No domination of women.

17:16.747 --> 17:20.802
We are equal but not similar.

17:21.895 --> 17:24.993
They are different, their constitution is different.

17:25.018 --> 17:30.326
What I have observed in North India is not satisfactory.

17:30.351 --> 17:32.203
They are not respected at all.

17:32.489 --> 17:33.675
There is somebody at home.

17:33.700 --> 17:39.336
I have observed it Myself that women don't have any respect

17:39.361 --> 17:42.273
She is troubled in every way.

17:43.485 --> 17:48.371
So we should think and try hard to change all this

17:49.050 --> 17:56.021
and this is another work of creation.

17:56.688 --> 18:00.787
This is not somebody's work of destruction but of creation.

18:00.812 --> 18:06.023
If this work of creation gets executed

18:06.048 --> 18:09.649
then our Bharat Bhoomi (Indian Land)

18:09.674 --> 18:11.668
which is Shasya Shyamla (Prosperous)

18:11.810 --> 18:14.726
there is no need of making any laws for this

18:15.075 --> 18:17.340
We should understand from within

18:17.365 --> 18:22.126
that a woman is in the form of Devi.

18:22.151 --> 18:24.833
If she is bad charactered it is a different situation.

18:24.858 --> 18:27.453
A woman is a Goddess

18:27.478 --> 18:31.099
and to respect her, take her care

18:31.433 --> 18:37.590
and to help her in all respects

18:37.747 --> 18:40.236
is the duty of every man.

18:40.261 --> 18:42.504
But it is never happens.

18:42.529 --> 18:46.384
Man always suppresses woman in every affair

18:46.861 --> 18:50.753
Man has more intellect but woman has heart.

18:50.778 --> 18:58.166
So an effort must be made to respect woman.

18:58.191 --> 19:01.356
A woman also must understand that

19:01.381 --> 19:04.731
till she is Devi Swarupa it is okay.

19:04.893 --> 19:09.752
But if she becomes different why should she be respected.

19:09.777 --> 19:12.799
she too should have this quality.

19:13.048 --> 19:14.756
She too should have this quality.

19:14.781 --> 19:18.919
If a woman doesn't have goodness, leave that woman

19:19.166 --> 19:20.526
divorce her.

19:20.551 --> 19:25.280
But the one who has, treat her nicely.

19:25.340 --> 19:27.104
It usually happens that

19:27.129 --> 19:32.395
those women who are dynamic and high headed are worshipped

19:32.420 --> 19:34.984
and those who are good are neglected.

19:36.266 --> 19:41.018
So in accordance with Sahaj culture

19:41.043 --> 19:43.564
we should become a good husband and wife.

19:43.658 --> 19:49.006
and there should be a great love and understanding between the two.

19:49.031 --> 19:54.434
Only then Sahaja Yoga can really spread, otherwise it cannot.

19:56.831 --> 20:03.894
In this way, there are many descriptions of Devi in our ‘Shastras’.

20:04.165 --> 20:10.579
These are absolutely all correct. There are no mistakes in that.

20:11.482 --> 20:13.668
But to understand them and their significance in depth

20:13.693 --> 20:15.987
you will have to do it through Sahaja Yoga.

20:16.012 --> 20:18.725
You will come to know it on the basis of vibrations.

20:18.786 --> 20:21.941
In that you will observe discriminations

20:22.044 --> 20:25.389
that every power has individual vibrations.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.349
It is very subtle.

20:28.374 --> 20:32.464
As you progress, you will understand it is better.

20:32.489 --> 20:35.008
It doesn't mean that you get involved in that only.

20:35.071 --> 20:40.685
It means that if you enhance your power with the help of meditation

20:41.003 --> 20:44.014
and bring yourself to that level

20:44.039 --> 20:46.320
you will yourself understand

20:47.083 --> 20:51.341
that just on seeing a person you will be able to understand his state.

20:53.521 --> 20:56.380
You will know that immediately

20:56.405 --> 20:57.966
because we are Gyan Margis (Knowers of truth)

20:58.013 --> 21:00.744
and this knowledge is now on our nerves.

21:00.768 --> 21:02.756
We will come to know all this.

21:02.781 --> 21:05.744
For that it is very important to meditate.

21:06.189 --> 21:08.169
There is no other way

21:08.194 --> 21:12.983
that you do puja and bhajan and all that.

21:13.555 --> 21:15.122
You should meditate

21:15.147 --> 21:19.360
and along with that you should introspect.

21:19.502 --> 21:21.347
Why i am doing so?

21:21.372 --> 21:23.754
Why i have to do like that?

21:23.779 --> 21:26.372
Attention should be on oneself

21:27.005 --> 21:29.358
and not to tell others, why is he meditating like that.

21:29.383 --> 21:31.669
Because that is not going to benefit you in any way.

21:31.694 --> 21:35.738
You have to rectify yourself and can rectify others as well.

21:36.048 --> 21:38.099
Introspect yourself

21:38.124 --> 21:39.790
what am i doing?

21:39.815 --> 21:41.401
Why am i thinking like that?

21:41.426 --> 21:43.332
Why such thoughts come to my mind?

21:44.163 --> 21:49.736
Pay attention to yourself and loving attention towards others

21:50.555 --> 21:55.061
that I am sitting in the train

21:55.086 --> 22:00.339
and do i have love for everyone in my inner being?

22:00.364 --> 22:03.088
Do i look at everyone with love?

22:03.113 --> 22:05.278
Do i forgive everyone?

22:05.303 --> 22:07.799
In this way there are two things.

22:07.824 --> 22:13.130
One is meditation and the other is self experience.

22:18.436 --> 22:21.731
These two things are responsible for man's progress.

22:21.756 --> 22:25.011
One is meditation, that is absolutely correct.

22:25.036 --> 22:30.629
By meditation you take vibrations inside youself

22:30.654 --> 22:35.338
and with your experience with self introspection also

22:35.363 --> 22:43.253
take out the obstacles that are inside your being.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.163
For example take the case of the flow of a stream.

22:45.188 --> 22:47.972
There are so many stones and other things in between.

22:47.997 --> 22:50.519
So the flow cannot be smooth.

22:50.544 --> 22:53.802
You find out the stones and throw out these

22:53.827 --> 22:57.799
the flow of kundalini will be absolutely forceful

22:57.824 --> 23:06.769
and you will yourself feel it, you will experience it.

23:06.794 --> 23:10.442
You will be all pure, now there is nothing (impure)

23:10.956 --> 23:12.873
You will be absolutely pure.

23:12.898 --> 23:15.393
That thing should come from inside.

23:16.290 --> 23:23.085
I say, in one way you meditate I know

23:23.110 --> 23:25.541
but you should introspect.

23:25.566 --> 23:29.712
You should think about yourself.

23:29.737 --> 23:34.634
There is no need to critisize oneself

23:34.659 --> 23:39.302
but you have to be in the witness state.

23:39.644 --> 23:45.758
And second thing is that how much do i love?

23:46.923 --> 23:48.815
How much pure i am?

23:49.998 --> 23:53.702
To what extent i am away from ego?

23:53.727 --> 23:57.373
if you start watching it, it will go slowly.

23:57.398 --> 24:01.003
For example, if there is a wicked person.

24:01.695 --> 24:03.397
He enters your house.

24:03.422 --> 24:06.372
He will run away just when you glance at him.

24:06.397 --> 24:10.354
In the same way, all these tresspassers will run away.

24:10.379 --> 24:13.438
Tthey will all run away if you introspect.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.450
Iif you say i am perfect

24:16.475 --> 24:19.224
i am perfectly alright, i will carry on like this.

24:19.648 --> 24:22.916
So there is a need to do this clearing.

24:22.941 --> 24:26.428
There is a need to get this NIRMALTA, this purity inside our being.

24:26.452 --> 24:28.802
And Kundalini is already doing its work

24:28.827 --> 24:31.084
that only will disengage you.

24:31.109 --> 24:34.927
Nobody can say that we can disengage.

24:35.173 --> 24:41.588
But that thing will be over just as soon as you glance at it.

24:41.613 --> 24:46.803
When they come, some people have a little greediness.

24:46.828 --> 24:50.701
For example the greed of getting power

24:50.726 --> 24:53.098
they are running, running and running after it.

24:53.123 --> 24:56.795
They get that power, even then they do not stop.

24:56.820 --> 25:00.842
When they get that power too, still are running after it.

25:00.899 --> 25:04.323
There is no end to it.

25:04.348 --> 25:06.820
Then you understand it yourself

25:06.845 --> 25:10.783
that i am running just like mad people for this power.

25:10.808 --> 25:11.941
It is all useless.

25:11.966 --> 25:14.041
Sit peacefully.

25:14.066 --> 25:16.996
Whatever you get, enjoy that.

25:17.021 --> 25:20.258
You are just running, not even enjoying what you get.

25:20.283 --> 25:21.463
You are not enjoying even that

25:21.488 --> 25:23.192
and then running just to grab another.

25:24.723 --> 25:28.812
When you will get this state, which I call Sahaj state

25:28.837 --> 25:35.014
in the Sahaj state all My powers are at your feet

25:35.158 --> 25:39.803
will manage you, will guide you and will bless you.

25:39.844 --> 25:43.124
You will get all this, but you must get Sahaj state.

25:43.149 --> 25:45.160
In that state,' i am going to do so

25:45.185 --> 25:47.399
i should do this, i have to do this, i have to do that'

25:47.518 --> 25:52.303
when you feel like this, according to Me it it is not Sahaj state yet.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.874
And when Sahaj state comes

25:54.899 --> 25:57.856
just as a little babe is taken care of in a cradle

25:57.881 --> 26:00.737
he remains there in the form of the power of Mother.

26:00.997 --> 26:03.556
And the description of whatever the number of powers is there

26:03.581 --> 26:05.169
all these powers

26:05.194 --> 26:10.019
at every moment and in every form are available, as per the need.

26:10.044 --> 26:14.728
Every power has some such particular speciality.

26:15.019 --> 26:20.128
And that is why we worship Shakti (power) and resper Her

26:20.672 --> 26:23.857
All of us respect Shakti more than an incarnation.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.732
The reason is that

26:25.757 --> 26:31.694
it is only Shakti which can guide us to recognize an incarnation.

26:31.719 --> 26:35.289
It is She only, it is because of Her insight

26:35.314 --> 26:40.261
that we can recognize an incarnation, otherwise we cannot.

26:40.363 --> 26:42.076
And then your Guru

26:42.101 --> 26:44.424
It is only Shakti who is your Mother

26:44.449 --> 26:46.590
and only Shakti

26:46.935 --> 26:51.016
is your (NOT CLEAR).

26:52.161 --> 26:55.206
And secondly, there is no need to recognize anyone else.

26:55.231 --> 26:58.010
Once you recognize Shakti

26:58.035 --> 27:00.380
Shakti will take care of everyone

27:00.405 --> 27:02.218
make everyone understand

27:02.243 --> 27:06.330
and you have observed in Sahaj

27:07.653 --> 27:10.523
that all of you recognize Me, that is okay

27:10.548 --> 27:13.856
but I make you to recognize other people.

27:15.451 --> 27:18.651
Respect these, respect those respect everyone.

27:20.913 --> 27:24.254
But if you had not recognized Me

27:24.279 --> 27:25.956
would have been recognizing any other incarnation.

27:26.655 --> 27:27.997
Take the case of Christ

27:28.269 --> 27:36.590
He has already said," We will send you such an incarnation

27:36.615 --> 27:39.067
Adishakti will come.

27:39.092 --> 27:43.037
Holy Ghost will come."

27:43.062 --> 27:48.411
Finally had He finished His work, why (NOT CLEAR)

27:48.436 --> 27:50.388
Mohammad sahab too had said so.

27:50.413 --> 27:53.337
Why everybody said so

27:53.404 --> 27:57.990
that the transformation of the world is going to take place.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.965
He predicted about future.

28:00.990 --> 28:04.865
It means in simple language

28:04.890 --> 28:08.094
that the prediction He made

28:08.356 --> 28:12.264
he did so, because He knew that the time was not appropriate as yet

28:12.289 --> 28:17.877
to take them to completeness.

28:17.902 --> 28:24.100
and for that completeness such a situation is about to come.

28:25.487 --> 28:32.878
By telling so, that such a situation is going to be there

28:32.903 --> 28:35.515
that definitely some such person is going to come

28:35.540 --> 28:39.818
and for that you keep only your attention clean

28:39.843 --> 28:44.257
your character pure and pray to God.

28:44.412 --> 28:46.448
They would tell about it

28:46.473 --> 28:49.259
but nobody gave collective vibrations.

28:49.284 --> 28:50.989
Very few people have got awareness.(CHETNA)

28:51.395 --> 28:57.033
As a result you have been able to get that.

28:57.905 --> 29:02.835
you should do intense progress in this field.

29:02.955 --> 29:05.046
Only two things have to be done.

29:05.071 --> 29:08.819
One is to meditate and the other is to introspect.

29:10.674 --> 29:13.094
and third thing is that

29:13.119 --> 29:17.591
you will develop aesthetic sense

29:17.616 --> 29:19.983
you will observe everyone's beauty

29:20.008 --> 29:22.098
you will observe his goodness.

29:22.123 --> 29:26.736
However wrongly a person may treat you

29:26.761 --> 29:28.301
you will understand

29:28.326 --> 29:30.687
that he had definitely this quality.

29:30.712 --> 29:32.666
It had to be understood.

29:32.691 --> 29:36.450
Your attention will shift from bad to goodness

29:36.475 --> 29:40.096
and when it will be on goodness, you adopt goodness.

29:40.121 --> 29:42.509
But if you pay attention to evil

29:42.534 --> 29:45.689
how can you adopt goodness.

29:45.714 --> 29:51.428
So in this situation as I said

29:51.453 --> 29:55.374
that you introspect yourself.

29:55.399 --> 29:59.509
You don't know how much joy that will give you.

30:00.767 --> 30:05.163
If you are beautiful inside, you will feel joyous on your own.

30:05.653 --> 30:09.143
If you observe it in others, you will be all the more joyous.

30:09.168 --> 30:11.560
So, let us pay attention to beauty only.

30:11.585 --> 30:14.390
We should pay attention to a man's goodness.

30:14.746 --> 30:17.577
and then you will be surprised

30:17.602 --> 30:20.987
that every person has a good quality

30:21.437 --> 30:23.639
but nobody can enjoy it.

30:23.664 --> 30:25.337
Take the case of a flower.

30:25.362 --> 30:27.720
It has got fragrance

30:27.745 --> 30:32.804
but if you don't have a nose, how can you smell fragrance?

30:33.517 --> 30:36.399
It is like that within your being

30:36.424 --> 30:38.183
there should be an undestanding

30:38.208 --> 30:45.275
to that love, to that gravity, to that greatness.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.217
and you imbibe that.

30:47.242 --> 30:54.139
He cannot give himself that much joy as much as you can.

30:54.491 --> 30:57.569
You can understand what is hidden in him.

30:57.594 --> 31:01.453
You can recognize KASTURI (his real worth) inside his being

31:01.478 --> 31:03.627
and can experience its joy.

31:03.652 --> 31:07.144
So the ability to feel joy from others

31:07.621 --> 31:09.665
is the work of SHAKTI only.

31:09.690 --> 31:12.985
SHAKTI gives joy.

31:13.010 --> 31:15.118
She is the giver of joy

31:15.143 --> 31:18.599
and when you will start feeling this joy

31:18.624 --> 31:23.712
then you will see, you will understand that now i have become Sahaj

31:24.289 --> 31:26.369
So this is Sahaja state.

31:26.394 --> 31:29.623
Your attention will not go at all to wrong things.

31:29.648 --> 31:30.530
What is its use?

31:32.876 --> 31:36.504
Because you don't have to slaughter anyone

31:36.529 --> 31:38.376
you don't have to destroy anyone.

31:38.401 --> 31:40.836
That is Devi's job, you don't have to do that.

31:41.372 --> 31:49.769
The joy that  is hidden at different places of the whole world

31:49.794 --> 31:51.007
to make an assessment of that

31:51.067 --> 31:54.241
it is in your destiny, to consume its fruit.

31:54.548 --> 31:58.936
So today, because I told you that

31:58.961 --> 32:03.253
it is the first day of Shaila Putri

32:04.302 --> 32:08.990
Shaila putri also means Her gaze

32:09.146 --> 32:11.573
because She was born in the Himalayas.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.567
The Himalaya is the highest of all the mountains

32:13.945 --> 32:18.106
and from there to keep an eye on the whole world

32:18.131 --> 32:21.951
first of all Shaila Putri's birth took place.

32:22.489 --> 32:24.505
She saw everything, existing in the world.

32:24.530 --> 32:26.665
look at small children as well.

32:26.690 --> 32:29.619
They watch everybody, who is this, who is that?

32:29.791 --> 32:33.119
Like that is the work of Shaila Putri.

32:33.144 --> 32:36.750
There are some more names like Shailaja etc.

32:36.775 --> 32:39.488
But what is recognized in our scriptures is that

32:39.513 --> 32:42.243
Navratri in the month of Chaitra

32:42.393 --> 32:47.056
in that the first incarnation of Devi is that of Shaila Putri.

32:47.795 --> 32:51.523
At many places, Navratri of Chaitra is very much recognized

32:51.548 --> 32:55.805
For example in Bihar CHATH is observed on the day of Shashti.

32:55.938 --> 32:59.700
CHATH is observed there on the day of Shashti (Sixth Day).

32:59.800 --> 33:04.889
That is out of these (Navratri) days only.

33:04.914 --> 33:08.862
At other places Gayatri and somewhere something else.

33:08.886 --> 33:13.662
Very right sided people should not recite Gayatri Mantra

33:13.687 --> 33:15.774
their right sided powers.

33:15.799 --> 33:19.506
It is better for them to recite left sided mantras.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.458
They are very right sided.

33:21.483 --> 33:23.919
Those who are left sided should recite right sided mantras

33:23.944 --> 33:27.379
In this way you get balance.

33:27.404 --> 33:31.962
I mean to say that it is the time to get drenched in joy

33:31.987 --> 33:34.663
It is a very important time.

33:34.688 --> 33:38.211
My birth also took place at such a time.

33:38.236 --> 33:41.805
Great thing is that after My birth

33:41.830 --> 33:47.607
Navroz starts from this date only. ( Navroz marks the New Year for Parsis)

33:47.632 --> 33:51.112
And after My birth Navratri starts.

33:51.137 --> 33:55.913
It has got very great combinations.

33:55.938 --> 34:01.809
So Navratri is only after twenty first March, not before that.

34:02.830 --> 34:08.519
In this way this Chaitra's (NAVRATRI) is great!

34:08.544 --> 34:11.198
In our country there are even songs about CHAITY.

34:11.223 --> 34:15.146
There is a special style of singing CHAITYI, CHAITY songs.

34:15.171 --> 34:16.666
What happens is that

34:16.691 --> 34:25.767
earlier saints, poets and lot of singers

34:26.753 --> 34:31.505
when they got the blessings of Chaitra

34:31.530 --> 34:35.474
it got bifurcated into tune and it started in the form of song.

34:35.499 --> 34:40.109
The joy of CHAITRA is highly regarded in villages.

34:40.433 --> 34:42.755
You listen to the songs of that time.

34:43.092 --> 34:46.599
It seems that great joy, enthusiasm from our inner being

34:46.624 --> 34:54.039
and a great mixture of love and joy.

34:54.064 --> 34:59.141
And from where can these village women have?

34:59.166 --> 35:01.365
How did village people have this?

35:01.390 --> 35:06.138
They write such beautiful poems.

35:06.163 --> 35:07.429
Where from did it come?

35:07.454 --> 35:10.271
The simple reason that they were simple hearted people.

35:10.296 --> 35:12.826
(NOT CLEAR)

35:12.851 --> 35:14.233
They would get it

35:14.258 --> 35:16.035
and they got it

35:16.060 --> 35:19.175
They had the capacity to receive it.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.781
We became separatists and became right sided.

35:22.806 --> 35:26.667
The Sahaja state should be obtained.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.046
The joy of Sahaja State

35:29.071 --> 35:32.324
they must not have felt that much joy as you will feel.

35:32.349 --> 35:34.313
When you will listen to the songs of CHAITY

35:34.338 --> 35:35.749
you will feel great joy.

35:35.774 --> 35:37.508
They will not feel so much joy.

35:37.533 --> 35:40.507
May be they might not have that power of assessment.

35:40.532 --> 35:43.344
But you can listen to that joyfully.

35:43.369 --> 35:45.937
So this is something special

35:45.962 --> 35:48.361
but the most special is

35:49.528 --> 35:53.517
that when Vikramaditya started his ‘Isvisan’ (era)

35:53.925 --> 36:04.228
he accepted this Tritya as the beginning point.

36:05.016 --> 36:08.769
Means that first day of the calender is called Akhshay Tritiya

36:08.794 --> 36:16.201
From Akhshay Tritiya only they started their calender.

36:16.226 --> 36:21.435
Like that Shalivahana made the calender like that only.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.379
After all why did they do so?

36:23.404 --> 36:28.452
The dates of both of them were the same.

36:30.641 --> 36:31.641
It is a matter of great surprise

36:32.129 --> 36:36.830
because it was vikramaditya's reign

36:36.855 --> 36:41.361
Shalivahanas attatcked him, defeated him

36:41.386 --> 36:47.225
He was grandson of Shalivahana and defeated him

36:47.250 --> 36:54.302
and after that he made Shalivahana's Shaka (calender).

36:54.327 --> 37:00.211
And Shalivahana's calender also has first date as Akhshay Tritiya.

37:00.236 --> 37:03.321
and their (Vikramaditya's) first date is also Akhshay Tritiya.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.433
It is very surprising

37:07.458 --> 37:11.910
And Muslim's Hijri is also the same.

37:12.609 --> 37:15.224
Their first date is the same.

37:15.249 --> 37:18.255
Everybody has recognised this as the first date.

37:18.280 --> 37:23.941
Parsis also call it Navroz.

37:23.966 --> 37:25.497
What is the reason?

37:25.522 --> 37:28.501
The reason is that they were inspired by the same Shakti.

37:29.863 --> 37:33.464
They considered this date as the important date

37:33.489 --> 37:36.059
and so whatever work you do on this date, you will get success.

37:37.656 --> 37:41.473
Especially, if people have to do some special work

37:41.498 --> 37:44.274
they do it on this day

37:44.299 --> 37:51.986
because it is considered as the most auspicious day.

37:52.011 --> 37:54.936
So, it is a matter of great pleasure that all of you came here

37:54.961 --> 38:01.276
and we came to know about it so much.

38:01.301 --> 38:05.646
So today we must take a decision within ourselves

38:05.671 --> 38:07.461
that we will meditate daily

38:07.794 --> 38:10.147
and along with this introspect.

38:10.172 --> 38:15.723
When we will think, we will think about ourselves, not about others.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.316
And then how shall we spend our life with sweetness

38:21.975 --> 38:25.685
in talking, in dealing with somebody.

38:25.710 --> 38:35.340
How can we express ourselves sweetly, all this should be learnt.

38:35.365 --> 38:39.204
We should not hurt anyone.

38:39.229 --> 38:42.158
On the contrary, say what you want to say.

38:42.183 --> 38:45.535
Sometimes, you have to say boldly

38:45.560 --> 38:48.869
but mostly when you tell something to the other person

38:48.894 --> 38:54.857
he must always feel that all this is said with love

38:55.110 --> 38:58.308
So you should say with that love only

38:58.333 --> 39:00.226
So how to express that

39:00.251 --> 39:02.094
For Me daily there is a question that

39:02.119 --> 39:05.910
he (A particular person) is coming and what to tell him.

39:05.997 --> 39:09.497
How to make each of them to understand.

39:10.271 --> 39:16.862
But this power of love when we see all around us

39:16.894 --> 39:18.247
we are in joy.

39:18.294 --> 39:25.235
We see it on earth, we see it in respect, love flowing everywhere

39:25.454 --> 39:27.775
we understand that love.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.526
It is with mutual reciprocation of love

39:29.551 --> 39:33.719
and after that, with that love only, you talk to everyone.

39:33.744 --> 39:38.848
Sahajyogis must not be angry with anyone

39:38.873 --> 39:39.883
leave that to Me.

39:41.279 --> 39:44.315
You should talk peacefully with everyone.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.213
There should be rightuousness in your speech

39:47.238 --> 39:50.056
It should appear that you are very rightuous

39:50.081 --> 39:54.651
there should be no hatred and anger within you.

39:55.583 --> 39:57.547
Then the people will understand.

39:57.572 --> 39:59.119
It is necessary.

39:59.144 --> 40:02.261
Now you have got your realization, everything is over.

40:02.515 --> 40:05.455
Now for the future

40:05.480 --> 40:08.549
I will tell you the personality that you require.

40:08.574 --> 40:12.409
I hope that you will follow that

40:12.664 --> 40:20.583
and introspect your inner being with love

40:20.608 --> 40:25.741
introspect yourself too with love , not with hatered  but with love

40:25.884 --> 40:28.937
and then you will undersand why am I doing so?

40:28.962 --> 40:30.740
leave it!

40:30.765 --> 40:33.832
In this way rightuousness prevails in an individual.

40:33.857 --> 40:37.060
Some are very rightuous.

40:37.085 --> 40:40.984
In this way, Sahajyoga will be beautiful

40:41.009 --> 40:45.597
and my dream that in the whole world

40:45.622 --> 40:49.481
there will be so many Sahajyogis that the whole world will change.

40:49.506 --> 40:51.389
(NOT CLEAR)

40:51.414 --> 40:55.522
Eternal blessings!
