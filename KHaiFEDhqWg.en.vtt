00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:43.564
In India two Navratris of Devi are observed.

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:54.101
Chaitra Navratri in which today's day is called Shaila Putri.

00:00:54.126 --> 00:01:02.495
Shailaputri means when She had first taken birth in Shivalaya.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.650
So, She is called Shaila Putri

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:11.827
and in this there are many other names of Hers.

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:16.965
But the significance of Shaila Putri is that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.981
Her first birth took place in the form of Shaila Putri.

00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:36.151
So, in that cold climate of Himalayas birth of Mary took place and

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:44.409
whatever She had to achieve, was limited to that Shailaputri form.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.760
But further story you already know that

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.351
Dakhsa organized a Havana.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.643
He didn't invite Shivji in that Havana.

00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:14.153
She was Shivji's wife.

00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:23.089
Then Devi, She is called Sati.

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:29.945
She gave Her AHUTI in HAVANKUND.(immolated Herself in fire)

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:38.951
Shivji came and picked Her body and left.

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:46.318
Her parts of body fell at various places

00:02:46.343 --> 00:02:49.862
and at those places we believe is Devi's power

00:02:49.887 --> 00:02:51.509
as it is in Vindyachal.

00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:53.255
It is everywhere.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:57.115
Her power acts there

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:17.750
and that power used to purify everything. it was so destructive.

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:24.655
because the seven powers which came along with that are not destructive.

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:33.516
After this, destructive power that came was right sided.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:46.288
For example, in the right side are Savitri, Gayatri.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:54.210
But the effect of destructive power was that

00:03:54.235 --> 00:04:00.212
one direction went to the left the other to the right

00:04:00.237 --> 00:04:07.394
and the destrutive power went to the center.

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:12.337
In that you see that Devi has many forms.

00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:20.271
There is Heart chakra for example Durga and many other forms

00:04:20.496 --> 00:04:23.274
with the help of which She protects.

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:25.490
She is settled in Heart.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:30.909
She resides in our Heart.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.782
So one power of Heart chakra is already there

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:47.835
that if somebody bothers you or attacks you

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.165
or puts you in confusion

00:04:54.443 --> 00:04:59.858
Shakti in your heart will protect you

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:04.523
and he who bothers you, will destroy him.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.006
There the greatest of Shakti (what should we say)

00:05:14.553 --> 00:05:24.257
its effectiveness is there because of the presence of Kundalini

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:27.772
When kundalini comes to Heart chakra

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:31.668
because Kundalini is Jagdamba, it is Amba

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:36.697
when it comes there, its this power multiplies more.

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:41.212
So when a human being accepts Sahajyoga

00:05:41.237 --> 00:05:43.775
and with the help of Kundalini awakening

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:47.954
this powers settles in his heart

00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:56.484
it manages you properly and protects you fully.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.277
No one can harm you.

00:05:59.302 --> 00:06:01.344
But you should place Her in your heart.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.894
You should place Mother in your heart.

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.714
This is the power of Mother, power of Motherhood.

00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:10.010
And the power of Motherhood is such that

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:18.041
it always protects her children.

00:06:18.748 --> 00:06:19.748
Always protects.

00:06:21.668 --> 00:06:27.679
That is why, whenever we are disturbed

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:31.262
in medical terminology it is said that the

00:06:31.302 --> 00:06:33.843
bone here (Shree Mataji points to Her center heart) starts shaking.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.873
and because of that

00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:44.497
the antibodies spread all around called Gannas in our language.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.177
These Gannas get the message and they get ready instantly.

00:06:50.508 --> 00:06:53.678
She is the Maharagini, the Queen of Gannas also

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:01.400
and they act on their command.

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:07.649
And between them, for example Ganesh and Devi

00:07:07.674 --> 00:07:13.085
question of quarrel doesn't arise ever.

00:07:13.686 --> 00:07:16.157
There is no question of unpleasantness between them.

00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:20.360
Both these powers are in oneness with their Mother.

00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:26.522
Ganesha is Her son and She is His Mother.

00:07:26.565 --> 00:07:30.105
Those who recognize Ganeshji

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.763
and those who have established Him within, specially in Sahaj

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:38.303
She takes care of them just like Her children.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.210
At every step and every where She looks after them

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:45.789
because She is Mother and you are Ganesha.

00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:48.374
But your Ganesha should be Nirmal (pure).

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:56.664
If there is anything wrong with your Ganesha, She corrects them.

00:07:56.688 --> 00:07:59.714
In this way she accomplishes various types of activities.

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.266
But today's significance is that

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:09.513
it is said that when She first of all took birth as Shaila putri

00:08:09.538 --> 00:08:18.668
and this would happen in Satyuga

00:08:18.693 --> 00:08:20.961
but before that

00:08:23.612 --> 00:08:25.813
when Adishakti incarnated in the universe

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:31.253
She took birth in the form of a cow.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:47.057
And in one way, we say there is a dewelling of paramchaitanya

00:08:47.082 --> 00:08:51.046
there She incarnated

00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:55.965
in the form of a cow.

00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:04.006
The question is that there first of all Gokul was established

00:09:05.734 --> 00:09:07.477
and there is that cow.

00:09:07.502 --> 00:09:09.539
Everything was first of all created

00:09:09.564 --> 00:09:12.977
and its reflection is within us.

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:18.616
For example, Sadashiv was reflected as Shree Shiva.

00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:22.953
Reflections of all came (into our being)

00:09:22.978 --> 00:09:26.771
and like that came that of Devi also.

00:09:26.843 --> 00:09:31.008
So when Devi's incarnation took place

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:36.172
when She took birth first in the form of a human being

00:09:36.197 --> 00:09:39.601
She is reflected as Shailaputri. So today is a very important day.

00:09:40.673 --> 00:09:45.910
But in that situation about which I am telling you

00:09:45.935 --> 00:09:49.759
which you say is the arrangement of Paramchaitanya

00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:51.855
you may call heaven or whatever you may say

00:09:52.704 --> 00:10:01.189
there She took birth as Adishakti.

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:03.531
She was in the form of a cow.

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:07.550
That is why we do not kill a cow, because She is Mother.

00:10:08.335 --> 00:10:12.081
There is a lot of difference between an Indian cow and a foreign cow.

00:10:12.106 --> 00:10:14.628
They look totally different.

00:10:15.207 --> 00:10:20.662
I remember, My grand daughters were small

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:23.521
and used to ask Me,"Nanee (Grand Mother)

00:10:23.546 --> 00:10:25.826
why are the buffalos here white?"

00:10:26.117 --> 00:10:30.142
There is no difference between the expression of cows and buffalos.

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:31.964
Both are just the same.

00:10:32.847 --> 00:10:39.060
Now that was not the time for Adishakti to give birth.

00:10:40.776 --> 00:10:47.320
because earlier as you know were DWAPAR,TRETA YUGA.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.271
She had to come in Kaliyuga only

00:10:49.296 --> 00:10:56.623
because She had to come with all the chakras and all the Goddesses

00:10:56.648 --> 00:11:00.447
With all the Shaktis (powers) She had to come in Kaliyuga

00:11:00.472 --> 00:11:02.415
otherwise this work could not have been done.

00:11:02.543 --> 00:11:04.657
It was such GHOR Kaliyuga (Most Intense and frightful time.)

00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:07.601
In this GHOR Kaliyuga it was difficult to do the work.

00:11:08.514 --> 00:11:11.795
and it had to be in the Mahamaya swarupa.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.808
Because in GHOR Kaliyuga

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:16.881
if anybody came to know that She is Adishakti

00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:18.674
they would run to kill her.

00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:22.979
So, She came as Mahamaya.

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:31.453
The earlier swarupa was not like Mahamaya swarupa.

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:35.631
It was in Her original form, overall glamourous.

00:11:35.656 --> 00:11:41.437
Because in those days there was no such thing

00:11:41.528 --> 00:11:45.515
that anybody could kill Devi.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.850
That time was different, as they say

00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:53.624
and that too Her birth took place in the lap of Himalayas

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.292
and after that Her marriage with Shree Shiva

00:11:56.317 --> 00:11:59.454
who was all powerful and Almighty.

00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:03.932
Often people have this question

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:07.049
that this is one Navratri and there is another Navratri

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:12.975
and for Devi they say, one is Mahakali and another is Mahasaraswati

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:20.208
All of them are there but they are all part and parcel of Adishakti.

00:12:20.248 --> 00:12:25.435
and now the manifestation that took place

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:32.132
that too happened at such a time that this work had to be done.

00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:36.347
For example, the existance of Shakamberi Devi in Meerut

00:12:36.372 --> 00:12:39.209
the manifestation of Shakambari Devi took place.

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:45.943
She had the power to increase agricultural production

00:12:46.276 --> 00:12:51.318
When we too were in Meerut we cultivated lot of agriculture

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:54.830
such big brinjals which could not be carried

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.603
such big tomatoes and such long and thick cucumbers

00:12:59.634 --> 00:13:01.780
People could not understand at that time how it happened..

00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:04.857
We got five or six prizes

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:09.397
It is the power of Shakambari Devi.

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:14.140
So at a place, whichever power of the Devi exists

00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:19.268
there whichever Shakti is present does the maximum work.

00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:28.982
Everybody used to get confused in that.

00:13:30.103 --> 00:13:33.072
But Shakti has different forms.

00:13:33.097 --> 00:13:36.259
And whichever and whenever She needs, She uses.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:44.010
It is not like this that this is Durga and who is this Chamunda.

00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:45.541
It is not like that

00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:49.105
She is all the forms together and all Her forms are necessary.

00:13:49.455 --> 00:13:55.043
Because individual Devtas work like this

00:13:55.157 --> 00:13:57.144
Devi is Shakti swarupa

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.771
and without Devi no incarnation can do any work.

00:14:02.796 --> 00:14:13.959
He may be a Guru or an incarnation like Rama or Krishna or Christ.

00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:17.703
Behind all of them is Devi's Shakti.

00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:23.014
That is why in our country Mother is respected by everyone.

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:28.364
Indians are actually the worshippers of Shakti.

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:32.819
As such they quarrel among themselves

00:14:32.844 --> 00:14:35.870
but in reality everybody is the worshipper of Shakti.

00:14:35.895 --> 00:14:38.765
Those who worship Vishnu also worship Shakti

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.138
those who are the worshippers of Shiva also worship Shakti

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.860
because nobody can divide Mother.

00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:49.193
There is such a big institution of Mother in our country.

00:14:49.218 --> 00:14:54.465
And we should respect Her.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.035
Mother and children both should respect (each other).

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.126
Till now women in our country are not so much spoilt.

00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:08.750
But they do not understand that to be a mother

00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:12.828
which qualities they should have to enrich themselves

00:15:12.853 --> 00:15:15.947
so that they have good children.

00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:22.248
Now a days because women are getting involved in other affairs

00:15:22.273 --> 00:15:24.648
they don't produce children

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.140
because why should such women have children?

00:15:30.165 --> 00:15:35.393
and in other countries where mothers are not good

00:15:35.418 --> 00:15:36.913
there children don't take birth.

00:15:37.933 --> 00:15:39.332
In Germany the population growth is minus.

00:15:39.357 --> 00:15:41.763
In America it is minus. All Whites are minus.

00:15:41.788 --> 00:15:45.807
Why it is so at all such places?

00:15:45.847 --> 00:15:48.564
The reason is that there is no quality of motherhood.

00:15:48.644 --> 00:15:50.722
Now by and by they have understood all this.

00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:52.467
Where there are no motherhood qualities

00:15:52.506 --> 00:15:55.782
Children are born, but they take birth at such places

00:15:55.807 --> 00:15:58.806
where they get love and are taken care of.

00:15:58.831 --> 00:16:04.872
Along with that I think that Indian husbands

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:12.219
should know how to respect and love their women.

00:16:12.244 --> 00:16:14.653
This is very important

00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:18.639
because it is possible that after some time

00:16:18.694 --> 00:16:21.638
people all over the world may recognize coming to India

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:22.755
as their supreme aim

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.549
they want to understand everything.

00:16:24.647 --> 00:16:33.084
But the state of women here, especially in North India, is very sad.

00:16:33.109 --> 00:16:36.707
Respecting women is considered as a great sin.

00:16:37.406 --> 00:16:41.473
Beating them up, and demanding dowry is a  common practice.

00:16:41.498 --> 00:16:46.567
In many ways, man wants to show his superiority to a woman.

00:16:46.592 --> 00:16:47.922
He is not.

00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:51.214
A man is superior in his own capacity.

00:16:51.564 --> 00:16:54.943
But he doesn't have the strength of a woman.

00:16:54.967 --> 00:16:58.132
He doesn't have the power to produce a child.

00:16:58.265 --> 00:17:00.976
Those who do not respect women

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:03.744
those countries also lead to destruction.

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:07.313
And those who do not respect Mother also lead to destruction.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:09.355
because their Shakti gets exhausted.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.678
It should not happen that they run after women.

00:17:14.703 --> 00:17:16.722
No domination of women.

00:17:16.747 --> 00:17:20.802
We are equal but not similar.

00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:24.993
They are different, their constitution is different.

00:17:25.018 --> 00:17:30.326
What I have observed in North India is not satisfactory.

00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:32.203
They are not respected at all.

00:17:32.489 --> 00:17:33.675
There is somebody at home.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.336
I have observed it Myself that women don't have any respect

00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:42.273
She is troubled in every way.

00:17:43.485 --> 00:17:48.371
So we should think and try hard to change all this

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:56.021
and this is another work of creation.

00:17:56.688 --> 00:18:00.787
This is not somebody's work of destruction but of creation.

00:18:00.812 --> 00:18:06.023
If this work of creation gets executed

00:18:06.048 --> 00:18:09.649
then our Bharat Bhoomi (Indian Land)

00:18:09.674 --> 00:18:11.668
which is Shasya Shyamla (Prosperous)

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.726
there is no need of making any laws for this

00:18:15.075 --> 00:18:17.340
We should understand from within

00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:22.126
that a woman is in the form of Devi.

00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:24.833
If she is bad charactered it is a different situation.

00:18:24.858 --> 00:18:27.453
A woman is a Goddess

00:18:27.478 --> 00:18:31.099
and to respect her, take her care

00:18:31.433 --> 00:18:37.590
and to help her in all respects

00:18:37.747 --> 00:18:40.236
is the duty of every man.

00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:42.504
But it is never happens.

00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:46.384
Man always suppresses woman in every affair

00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:50.753
Man has more intellect but woman has heart.

00:18:50.778 --> 00:18:58.166
So an effort must be made to respect woman.

00:18:58.191 --> 00:19:01.356
A woman also must understand that

00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:04.731
till she is Devi Swarupa it is okay.

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:09.752
But if she becomes different why should she be respected.

00:19:09.777 --> 00:19:12.799
she too should have this quality.

00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:14.756
She too should have this quality.

00:19:14.781 --> 00:19:18.919
If a woman doesn't have goodness, leave that woman

00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:20.526
divorce her.

00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:25.280
But the one who has, treat her nicely.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.104
It usually happens that

00:19:27.129 --> 00:19:32.395
those women who are dynamic and high headed are worshipped

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.984
and those who are good are neglected.

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:41.018
So in accordance with Sahaj culture

00:19:41.043 --> 00:19:43.564
we should become a good husband and wife.

00:19:43.658 --> 00:19:49.006
and there should be a great love and understanding between the two.

00:19:49.031 --> 00:19:54.434
Only then Sahaja Yoga can really spread, otherwise it cannot.

00:19:56.831 --> 00:20:03.894
In this way, there are many descriptions of Devi in our ‘Shastras’.

00:20:04.165 --> 00:20:10.579
These are absolutely all correct. There are no mistakes in that.

00:20:11.482 --> 00:20:13.668
But to understand them and their significance in depth

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:15.987
you will have to do it through Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:18.725
You will come to know it on the basis of vibrations.

00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:21.941
In that you will observe discriminations

00:20:22.044 --> 00:20:25.389
that every power has individual vibrations.

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:28.349
It is very subtle.

00:20:28.374 --> 00:20:32.464
As you progress, you will understand it is better.

00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:35.008
It doesn't mean that you get involved in that only.

00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:40.685
It means that if you enhance your power with the help of meditation

00:20:41.003 --> 00:20:44.014
and bring yourself to that level

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:46.320
you will yourself understand

00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:51.341
that just on seeing a person you will be able to understand his state.

00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:56.380
You will know that immediately

00:20:56.405 --> 00:20:57.966
because we are Gyan Margis (Knowers of truth)

00:20:58.013 --> 00:21:00.744
and this knowledge is now on our nerves.

00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:02.756
We will come to know all this.

00:21:02.781 --> 00:21:05.744
For that it is very important to meditate.

00:21:06.189 --> 00:21:08.169
There is no other way

00:21:08.194 --> 00:21:12.983
that you do puja and bhajan and all that.

00:21:13.555 --> 00:21:15.122
You should meditate

00:21:15.147 --> 00:21:19.360
and along with that you should introspect.

00:21:19.502 --> 00:21:21.347
Why i am doing so?

00:21:21.372 --> 00:21:23.754
Why i have to do like that?

00:21:23.779 --> 00:21:26.372
Attention should be on oneself

00:21:27.005 --> 00:21:29.358
and not to tell others, why is he meditating like that.

00:21:29.383 --> 00:21:31.669
Because that is not going to benefit you in any way.

00:21:31.694 --> 00:21:35.738
You have to rectify yourself and can rectify others as well.

00:21:36.048 --> 00:21:38.099
Introspect yourself

00:21:38.124 --> 00:21:39.790
what am i doing?

00:21:39.815 --> 00:21:41.401
Why am i thinking like that?

00:21:41.426 --> 00:21:43.332
Why such thoughts come to my mind?

00:21:44.163 --> 00:21:49.736
Pay attention to yourself and loving attention towards others

00:21:50.555 --> 00:21:55.061
that I am sitting in the train

00:21:55.086 --> 00:22:00.339
and do i have love for everyone in my inner being?

00:22:00.364 --> 00:22:03.088
Do i look at everyone with love?

00:22:03.113 --> 00:22:05.278
Do i forgive everyone?

00:22:05.303 --> 00:22:07.799
In this way there are two things.

00:22:07.824 --> 00:22:13.130
One is meditation and the other is self experience.

00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:21.731
These two things are responsible for man's progress.

00:22:21.756 --> 00:22:25.011
One is meditation, that is absolutely correct.

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:30.629
By meditation you take vibrations inside youself

00:22:30.654 --> 00:22:35.338
and with your experience with self introspection also

00:22:35.363 --> 00:22:43.253
take out the obstacles that are inside your being.

00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.163
For example take the case of the flow of a stream.

00:22:45.188 --> 00:22:47.972
There are so many stones and other things in between.

00:22:47.997 --> 00:22:50.519
So the flow cannot be smooth.

00:22:50.544 --> 00:22:53.802
You find out the stones and throw out these

00:22:53.827 --> 00:22:57.799
the flow of kundalini will be absolutely forceful

00:22:57.824 --> 00:23:06.769
and you will yourself feel it, you will experience it.

00:23:06.794 --> 00:23:10.442
You will be all pure, now there is nothing (impure)

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.873
You will be absolutely pure.

00:23:12.898 --> 00:23:15.393
That thing should come from inside.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:23.085
I say, in one way you meditate I know

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.541
but you should introspect.

00:23:25.566 --> 00:23:29.712
You should think about yourself.

00:23:29.737 --> 00:23:34.634
There is no need to critisize oneself

00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:39.302
but you have to be in the witness state.

00:23:39.644 --> 00:23:45.758
And second thing is that how much do i love?

00:23:46.923 --> 00:23:48.815
How much pure i am?

00:23:49.998 --> 00:23:53.702
To what extent i am away from ego?

00:23:53.727 --> 00:23:57.373
if you start watching it, it will go slowly.

00:23:57.398 --> 00:24:01.003
For example, if there is a wicked person.

00:24:01.695 --> 00:24:03.397
He enters your house.

00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:06.372
He will run away just when you glance at him.

00:24:06.397 --> 00:24:10.354
In the same way, all these tresspassers will run away.

00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:13.438
Tthey will all run away if you introspect.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.450
Iif you say i am perfect

00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:19.224
i am perfectly alright, i will carry on like this.

00:24:19.648 --> 00:24:22.916
So there is a need to do this clearing.

00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.428
There is a need to get this NIRMALTA, this purity inside our being.

00:24:26.452 --> 00:24:28.802
And Kundalini is already doing its work

00:24:28.827 --> 00:24:31.084
that only will disengage you.

00:24:31.109 --> 00:24:34.927
Nobody can say that we can disengage.

00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:41.588
But that thing will be over just as soon as you glance at it.

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:46.803
When they come, some people have a little greediness.

00:24:46.828 --> 00:24:50.701
For example the greed of getting power

00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:53.098
they are running, running and running after it.

00:24:53.123 --> 00:24:56.795
They get that power, even then they do not stop.

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.842
When they get that power too, still are running after it.

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:04.323
There is no end to it.

00:25:04.348 --> 00:25:06.820
Then you understand it yourself

00:25:06.845 --> 00:25:10.783
that i am running just like mad people for this power.

00:25:10.808 --> 00:25:11.941
It is all useless.

00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:14.041
Sit peacefully.

00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:16.996
Whatever you get, enjoy that.

00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:20.258
You are just running, not even enjoying what you get.

00:25:20.283 --> 00:25:21.463
You are not enjoying even that

00:25:21.488 --> 00:25:23.192
and then running just to grab another.

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:28.812
When you will get this state, which I call Sahaj state

00:25:28.837 --> 00:25:35.014
in the Sahaj state all My powers are at your feet

00:25:35.158 --> 00:25:39.803
will manage you, will guide you and will bless you.

00:25:39.844 --> 00:25:43.124
You will get all this, but you must get Sahaj state.

00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:45.160
In that state,' i am going to do so

00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:47.399
i should do this, i have to do this, i have to do that'

00:25:47.518 --> 00:25:52.303
when you feel like this, according to Me it it is not Sahaj state yet.

00:25:53.011 --> 00:25:54.874
And when Sahaj state comes

00:25:54.899 --> 00:25:57.856
just as a little babe is taken care of in a cradle

00:25:57.881 --> 00:26:00.737
he remains there in the form of the power of Mother.

00:26:00.997 --> 00:26:03.556
And the description of whatever the number of powers is there

00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:05.169
all these powers

00:26:05.194 --> 00:26:10.019
at every moment and in every form are available, as per the need.

00:26:10.044 --> 00:26:14.728
Every power has some such particular speciality.

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:20.128
And that is why we worship Shakti (power) and resper Her

00:26:20.672 --> 00:26:23.857
All of us respect Shakti more than an incarnation.

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.732
The reason is that

00:26:25.757 --> 00:26:31.694
it is only Shakti which can guide us to recognize an incarnation.

00:26:31.719 --> 00:26:35.289
It is She only, it is because of Her insight

00:26:35.314 --> 00:26:40.261
that we can recognize an incarnation, otherwise we cannot.

00:26:40.363 --> 00:26:42.076
And then your Guru

00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.424
It is only Shakti who is your Mother

00:26:44.449 --> 00:26:46.590
and only Shakti

00:26:46.935 --> 00:26:51.016
is your (NOT CLEAR).

00:26:52.161 --> 00:26:55.206
And secondly, there is no need to recognize anyone else.

00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:58.010
Once you recognize Shakti

00:26:58.035 --> 00:27:00.380
Shakti will take care of everyone

00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:02.218
make everyone understand

00:27:02.243 --> 00:27:06.330
and you have observed in Sahaj

00:27:07.653 --> 00:27:10.523
that all of you recognize Me, that is okay

00:27:10.548 --> 00:27:13.856
but I make you to recognize other people.

00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:18.651
Respect these, respect those respect everyone.

00:27:20.913 --> 00:27:24.254
But if you had not recognized Me

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:25.956
would have been recognizing any other incarnation.

00:27:26.655 --> 00:27:27.997
Take the case of Christ

00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:36.590
He has already said," We will send you such an incarnation

00:27:36.615 --> 00:27:39.067
Adishakti will come.

00:27:39.092 --> 00:27:43.037
Holy Ghost will come."

00:27:43.062 --> 00:27:48.411
Finally had He finished His work, why (NOT CLEAR)

00:27:48.436 --> 00:27:50.388
Mohammad sahab too had said so.

00:27:50.413 --> 00:27:53.337
Why everybody said so

00:27:53.404 --> 00:27:57.990
that the transformation of the world is going to take place.

00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:00.965
He predicted about future.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.865
It means in simple language

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.094
that the prediction He made

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:12.264
he did so, because He knew that the time was not appropriate as yet

00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:17.877
to take them to completeness.

00:28:17.902 --> 00:28:24.100
and for that completeness such a situation is about to come.

00:28:25.487 --> 00:28:32.878
By telling so, that such a situation is going to be there

00:28:32.903 --> 00:28:35.515
that definitely some such person is going to come

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.818
and for that you keep only your attention clean

00:28:39.843 --> 00:28:44.257
your character pure and pray to God.

00:28:44.412 --> 00:28:46.448
They would tell about it

00:28:46.473 --> 00:28:49.259
but nobody gave collective vibrations.

00:28:49.284 --> 00:28:50.989
Very few people have got awareness.(CHETNA)

00:28:51.395 --> 00:28:57.033
As a result you have been able to get that.

00:28:57.905 --> 00:29:02.835
you should do intense progress in this field.

00:29:02.955 --> 00:29:05.046
Only two things have to be done.

00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:08.819
One is to meditate and the other is to introspect.

00:29:10.674 --> 00:29:13.094
and third thing is that

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:17.591
you will develop aesthetic sense

00:29:17.616 --> 00:29:19.983
you will observe everyone's beauty

00:29:20.008 --> 00:29:22.098
you will observe his goodness.

00:29:22.123 --> 00:29:26.736
However wrongly a person may treat you

00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:28.301
you will understand

00:29:28.326 --> 00:29:30.687
that he had definitely this quality.

00:29:30.712 --> 00:29:32.666
It had to be understood.

00:29:32.691 --> 00:29:36.450
Your attention will shift from bad to goodness

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:40.096
and when it will be on goodness, you adopt goodness.

00:29:40.121 --> 00:29:42.509
But if you pay attention to evil

00:29:42.534 --> 00:29:45.689
how can you adopt goodness.

00:29:45.714 --> 00:29:51.428
So in this situation as I said

00:29:51.453 --> 00:29:55.374
that you introspect yourself.

00:29:55.399 --> 00:29:59.509
You don't know how much joy that will give you.

00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:05.163
If you are beautiful inside, you will feel joyous on your own.

00:30:05.653 --> 00:30:09.143
If you observe it in others, you will be all the more joyous.

00:30:09.168 --> 00:30:11.560
So, let us pay attention to beauty only.

00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:14.390
We should pay attention to a man's goodness.

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:17.577
and then you will be surprised

00:30:17.602 --> 00:30:20.987
that every person has a good quality

00:30:21.437 --> 00:30:23.639
but nobody can enjoy it.

00:30:23.664 --> 00:30:25.337
Take the case of a flower.

00:30:25.362 --> 00:30:27.720
It has got fragrance

00:30:27.745 --> 00:30:32.804
but if you don't have a nose, how can you smell fragrance?

00:30:33.517 --> 00:30:36.399
It is like that within your being

00:30:36.424 --> 00:30:38.183
there should be an undestanding

00:30:38.208 --> 00:30:45.275
to that love, to that gravity, to that greatness.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.217
and you imbibe that.

00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:54.139
He cannot give himself that much joy as much as you can.

00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:57.569
You can understand what is hidden in him.

00:30:57.594 --> 00:31:01.453
You can recognize KASTURI (his real worth) inside his being

00:31:01.478 --> 00:31:03.627
and can experience its joy.

00:31:03.652 --> 00:31:07.144
So the ability to feel joy from others

00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:09.665
is the work of SHAKTI only.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.985
SHAKTI gives joy.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.118
She is the giver of joy

00:31:15.143 --> 00:31:18.599
and when you will start feeling this joy

00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:23.712
then you will see, you will understand that now i have become Sahaj

00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:26.369
So this is Sahaja state.

00:31:26.394 --> 00:31:29.623
Your attention will not go at all to wrong things.

00:31:29.648 --> 00:31:30.530
What is its use?

00:31:32.876 --> 00:31:36.504
Because you don't have to slaughter anyone

00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:38.376
you don't have to destroy anyone.

00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:40.836
That is Devi's job, you don't have to do that.

00:31:41.372 --> 00:31:49.769
The joy that  is hidden at different places of the whole world

00:31:49.794 --> 00:31:51.007
to make an assessment of that

00:31:51.067 --> 00:31:54.241
it is in your destiny, to consume its fruit.

00:31:54.548 --> 00:31:58.936
So today, because I told you that

00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:03.253
it is the first day of Shaila Putri

00:32:04.302 --> 00:32:08.990
Shaila putri also means Her gaze

00:32:09.146 --> 00:32:11.573
because She was born in the Himalayas.

00:32:11.598 --> 00:32:13.567
The Himalaya is the highest of all the mountains

00:32:13.945 --> 00:32:18.106
and from there to keep an eye on the whole world

00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:21.951
first of all Shaila Putri's birth took place.

00:32:22.489 --> 00:32:24.505
She saw everything, existing in the world.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.665
look at small children as well.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.619
They watch everybody, who is this, who is that?

00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:33.119
Like that is the work of Shaila Putri.

00:32:33.144 --> 00:32:36.750
There are some more names like Shailaja etc.

00:32:36.775 --> 00:32:39.488
But what is recognized in our scriptures is that

00:32:39.513 --> 00:32:42.243
Navratri in the month of Chaitra

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:47.056
in that the first incarnation of Devi is that of Shaila Putri.

00:32:47.795 --> 00:32:51.523
At many places, Navratri of Chaitra is very much recognized

00:32:51.548 --> 00:32:55.805
For example in Bihar CHATH is observed on the day of Shashti.

00:32:55.938 --> 00:32:59.700
CHATH is observed there on the day of Shashti (Sixth Day).

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:04.889
That is out of these (Navratri) days only.

00:33:04.914 --> 00:33:08.862
At other places Gayatri and somewhere something else.

00:33:08.886 --> 00:33:13.662
Very right sided people should not recite Gayatri Mantra

00:33:13.687 --> 00:33:15.774
their right sided powers.

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:19.506
It is better for them to recite left sided mantras.

00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:21.458
They are very right sided.

00:33:21.483 --> 00:33:23.919
Those who are left sided should recite right sided mantras

00:33:23.944 --> 00:33:27.379
In this way you get balance.

00:33:27.404 --> 00:33:31.962
I mean to say that it is the time to get drenched in joy

00:33:31.987 --> 00:33:34.663
It is a very important time.

00:33:34.688 --> 00:33:38.211
My birth also took place at such a time.

00:33:38.236 --> 00:33:41.805
Great thing is that after My birth

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:47.607
Navroz starts from this date only. ( Navroz marks the New Year for Parsis)

00:33:47.632 --> 00:33:51.112
And after My birth Navratri starts.

00:33:51.137 --> 00:33:55.913
It has got very great combinations.

00:33:55.938 --> 00:34:01.809
So Navratri is only after twenty first March, not before that.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:08.519
In this way this Chaitra's (NAVRATRI) is great!

00:34:08.544 --> 00:34:11.198
In our country there are even songs about CHAITY.

00:34:11.223 --> 00:34:15.146
There is a special style of singing CHAITYI, CHAITY songs.

00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:16.666
What happens is that

00:34:16.691 --> 00:34:25.767
earlier saints, poets and lot of singers

00:34:26.753 --> 00:34:31.505
when they got the blessings of Chaitra

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.474
it got bifurcated into tune and it started in the form of song.

00:34:35.499 --> 00:34:40.109
The joy of CHAITRA is highly regarded in villages.

00:34:40.433 --> 00:34:42.755
You listen to the songs of that time.

00:34:43.092 --> 00:34:46.599
It seems that great joy, enthusiasm from our inner being

00:34:46.624 --> 00:34:54.039
and a great mixture of love and joy.

00:34:54.064 --> 00:34:59.141
And from where can these village women have?

00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:01.365
How did village people have this?

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:06.138
They write such beautiful poems.

00:35:06.163 --> 00:35:07.429
Where from did it come?

00:35:07.454 --> 00:35:10.271
The simple reason that they were simple hearted people.

00:35:10.296 --> 00:35:12.826
(NOT CLEAR)

00:35:12.851 --> 00:35:14.233
They would get it

00:35:14.258 --> 00:35:16.035
and they got it

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.175
They had the capacity to receive it.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.781
We became separatists and became right sided.

00:35:22.806 --> 00:35:26.667
The Sahaja state should be obtained.

00:35:26.692 --> 00:35:29.046
The joy of Sahaja State

00:35:29.071 --> 00:35:32.324
they must not have felt that much joy as you will feel.

00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:34.313
When you will listen to the songs of CHAITY

00:35:34.338 --> 00:35:35.749
you will feel great joy.

00:35:35.774 --> 00:35:37.508
They will not feel so much joy.

00:35:37.533 --> 00:35:40.507
May be they might not have that power of assessment.

00:35:40.532 --> 00:35:43.344
But you can listen to that joyfully.

00:35:43.369 --> 00:35:45.937
So this is something special

00:35:45.962 --> 00:35:48.361
but the most special is

00:35:49.528 --> 00:35:53.517
that when Vikramaditya started his ‘Isvisan’ (era)

00:35:53.925 --> 00:36:04.228
he accepted this Tritya as the beginning point.

00:36:05.016 --> 00:36:08.769
Means that first day of the calender is called Akhshay Tritiya

00:36:08.794 --> 00:36:16.201
From Akhshay Tritiya only they started their calender.

00:36:16.226 --> 00:36:21.435
Like that Shalivahana made the calender like that only.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.379
After all why did they do so?

00:36:23.404 --> 00:36:28.452
The dates of both of them were the same.

00:36:30.641 --> 00:36:31.641
It is a matter of great surprise

00:36:32.129 --> 00:36:36.830
because it was vikramaditya's reign

00:36:36.855 --> 00:36:41.361
Shalivahanas attatcked him, defeated him

00:36:41.386 --> 00:36:47.225
He was grandson of Shalivahana and defeated him

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:54.302
and after that he made Shalivahana's Shaka (calender).

00:36:54.327 --> 00:37:00.211
And Shalivahana's calender also has first date as Akhshay Tritiya.

00:37:00.236 --> 00:37:03.321
and their (Vikramaditya's) first date is also Akhshay Tritiya.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.433
It is very surprising

00:37:07.458 --> 00:37:11.910
And Muslim's Hijri is also the same.

00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:15.224
Their first date is the same.

00:37:15.249 --> 00:37:18.255
Everybody has recognised this as the first date.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.941
Parsis also call it Navroz.

00:37:23.966 --> 00:37:25.497
What is the reason?

00:37:25.522 --> 00:37:28.501
The reason is that they were inspired by the same Shakti.

00:37:29.863 --> 00:37:33.464
They considered this date as the important date

00:37:33.489 --> 00:37:36.059
and so whatever work you do on this date, you will get success.

00:37:37.656 --> 00:37:41.473
Especially, if people have to do some special work

00:37:41.498 --> 00:37:44.274
they do it on this day

00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:51.986
because it is considered as the most auspicious day.

00:37:52.011 --> 00:37:54.936
So, it is a matter of great pleasure that all of you came here

00:37:54.961 --> 00:38:01.276
and we came to know about it so much.

00:38:01.301 --> 00:38:05.646
So today we must take a decision within ourselves

00:38:05.671 --> 00:38:07.461
that we will meditate daily

00:38:07.794 --> 00:38:10.147
and along with this introspect.

00:38:10.172 --> 00:38:15.723
When we will think, we will think about ourselves, not about others.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.316
And then how shall we spend our life with sweetness

00:38:21.975 --> 00:38:25.685
in talking, in dealing with somebody.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:35.340
How can we express ourselves sweetly, all this should be learnt.

00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:39.204
We should not hurt anyone.

00:38:39.229 --> 00:38:42.158
On the contrary, say what you want to say.

00:38:42.183 --> 00:38:45.535
Sometimes, you have to say boldly

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.869
but mostly when you tell something to the other person

00:38:48.894 --> 00:38:54.857
he must always feel that all this is said with love

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:58.308
So you should say with that love only

00:38:58.333 --> 00:39:00.226
So how to express that

00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:02.094
For Me daily there is a question that

00:39:02.119 --> 00:39:05.910
he (A particular person) is coming and what to tell him.

00:39:05.997 --> 00:39:09.497
How to make each of them to understand.

00:39:10.271 --> 00:39:16.862
But this power of love when we see all around us

00:39:16.894 --> 00:39:18.247
we are in joy.

00:39:18.294 --> 00:39:25.235
We see it on earth, we see it in respect, love flowing everywhere

00:39:25.454 --> 00:39:27.775
we understand that love.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.526
It is with mutual reciprocation of love

00:39:29.551 --> 00:39:33.719
and after that, with that love only, you talk to everyone.

00:39:33.744 --> 00:39:38.848
Sahajyogis must not be angry with anyone

00:39:38.873 --> 00:39:39.883
leave that to Me.

00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:44.315
You should talk peacefully with everyone.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.213
There should be rightuousness in your speech

00:39:47.238 --> 00:39:50.056
It should appear that you are very rightuous

00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:54.651
there should be no hatred and anger within you.

00:39:55.583 --> 00:39:57.547
Then the people will understand.

00:39:57.572 --> 00:39:59.119
It is necessary.

00:39:59.144 --> 00:40:02.261
Now you have got your realization, everything is over.

00:40:02.515 --> 00:40:05.455
Now for the future

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.549
I will tell you the personality that you require.

00:40:08.574 --> 00:40:12.409
I hope that you will follow that

00:40:12.664 --> 00:40:20.583
and introspect your inner being with love

00:40:20.608 --> 00:40:25.741
introspect yourself too with love , not with hatered  but with love

00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:28.937
and then you will undersand why am I doing so?

00:40:28.962 --> 00:40:30.740
leave it!

00:40:30.765 --> 00:40:33.832
In this way rightuousness prevails in an individual.

00:40:33.857 --> 00:40:37.060
Some are very rightuous.

00:40:37.085 --> 00:40:40.984
In this way, Sahajyoga will be beautiful

00:40:41.009 --> 00:40:45.597
and my dream that in the whole world

00:40:45.622 --> 00:40:49.481
there will be so many Sahajyogis that the whole world will change.

00:40:49.506 --> 00:40:51.389
(NOT CLEAR)

00:40:51.414 --> 00:40:55.522
Eternal blessings!
