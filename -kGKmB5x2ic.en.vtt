00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.740
Seminars like this are very useful,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.300
because then you can pick out people
who are very seriously interested

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.940
in Sahaj Yog; who are dedicated,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.400
who have passion for Sahaj Yoga,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.720
who feel that it is the most important
thing of life.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.780
Now, you must have realised
that you are the people

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.260
who are the men of God
and women of God,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.860
and that you have to be prepared
to take this banner of new age,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.900
of transforming Sahaj Yoga into Maha Yog,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.100
into a vast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.260
area of spirituality.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.440
You are the channels
and you are going to generate

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.380
this energy through you.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.500
If you were just channels
then your responsibility

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.640
would have been much reduced.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.480
But Sahaj Yoga: it’s a very different
type of a living process.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.180
Perhaps you might have noticed it:

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.260
that once you receive your Realisation
it starts transforming you, firstly.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.900
Then it starts transforming other people.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.660
By your presence you start transforming
the other people.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.560
By your existence, you start transforming
other people.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.640
You start transforming the atmosphere.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:17.520
The subtler problems of negativity,
they all work out.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.860
Like a tree, when it is blossoming,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:36.360
the fragrance of the blossom creates
a different type of aura around itself

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.260
that it attracts all the bees around
to gather the honey.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.740
In the same way, when a person is
realised, is enlightened,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.420
the aura spreads and you start getting
people attracted towards you.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.560
We have to remember a few points
about Sahaj Yog.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.040
That you receive the light first.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.000
The second step is that
you generate the light.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.600
It is never done in any other process
that you generate the light, on your own,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.100
with your will, with your understanding,
with your freedom.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:54.420
For example, a tree may give rise
to seeds and seeds might become trees,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.040
but seeds do not regenerate,
they do not have a will.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.820
Because here the seeds are human beings.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.780
Only the human beings have the will.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.220
Now you being enlightened with your will,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.680
with your will you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.460
regenerate,
or you would say,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.840
you can generate on your own,
Sahaj Yoga, to go further.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.580
It’s a very subtle understanding:

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.220
that when a light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:57.960
comes into this candle
but it cannot regenerate of its will any

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.000
other; somebody else has to take it
to them.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.140
So your will is very important
in Sahaj Yog: what do you will.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.940
That is very, very important.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.540
Now will does not mean desire.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.020
Will means desire put into action.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.160
So what you do is to desire&nbsp;

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.120
and then you put it into action.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.680
You can do it.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.340
First of all we have to know
that we must have desire.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.000
That is there no doubt:
you are categorically seekers.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.580
I mean you are that category.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.820
You are born as seekers.
You cannot get out of it.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.660
You are seekers.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.580
Whatever may be your problems,
from whatever source you might have come,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.640
whatever mistakes you may commit,
but you are seekers.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.140
Seekers are seekers.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.200
For example in this room if you see
how many lights there are:

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:43.440
at the most 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11:
in both the rooms put together.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.600
In this room only five.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.880
Everybody is not a light.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:58.860
You are the light givers
and it is going to work out

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.940
through your will.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.040
So how powerful our will should be!

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:14.880
How dedicated we should be
about our will, that, one has to know.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.260
You have to fathom out that
will within you.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.660
Once you start doing this Sahaj Yoga,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:39.120
then you recognise how important is
Sahaj Yoga that it gives a real meaning

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.720
to the whole Creation in the eyes of God
and Divine power.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.200
That has to work out.
That’s the purpose of life.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.480
And surprisingly it is left to your will,
not to my will.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.280
I have no will, I have no action.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.800
So it is your will which is going to
work it out.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.740
So you have to dedicate.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.020
And now you have to weigh yourself:
“How much I am willed?”

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:41.220
The seminars help you to see how much
you really will that Sahaj Yoga

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.000
should be successful.
This is the second point.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.500
To make it successful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.140
what should we do?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:06.240
We must understand the basics of
Sahaj Yoga and try to see within

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.100
ourselves: do we understand the basics
and do we have those qualities

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.440
by which we sustain those basics?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.520
The first basic of Sahaj Yoga is that
you have to become your Spirit

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:41.560
so that your body emits
the powers of Spirit alone.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.520
This is the first basic of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:10:05.160
So far, in all the religions,
all the great books, even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.460
Bible or Geeta,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.580
it is written that you must have faith,
you must have faith.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.000
‘Faith’ word was never clarified
in any one of these books

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.730
and mostly people thought blind faith
is the only way to believe –

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.540
is to have blind faith.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.640
It should have been clarified.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.160
But it was kept a vague term as ‘faith’.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.140
They do use ‘blind faith’ and faith.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.400
So the people started working it out.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.300
For example you are walking on the road
and you say,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.780
“I was thinking of God and suddenly
I found a gold ring

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.800
so that my faith was substantiated
that it is God who has helped me

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.760
to get the gold ring.”

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.680
Or say that there was a divorce on
or something like that

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.760
and you prayed to God
and the divorce did not take place

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.500
so it is God’s help.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.840
But this kind of faith
can have another side.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.440
People can say that the people
who do not believe in God at all

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.880
are quite successful.
Then how do you explain that?

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.040
They have no faith,
they are actually heathens,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.020
but they are very successful in life.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.460
So how do you explain that side?

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.740
Sahaj Yoga has another very great truth:

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:16.120
that it is the revelation of all
the vague terms that were used before.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:24.360
Because people were not given Realisation
one could not talk of faith,

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.380
a blind faith and the real faith.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.640
Because if they do not have their eyes,
how can you tell them about the light

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.560
or the darkness?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.800
So, that time the faith was sustenance –&nbsp;

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.640
how to sustain yourself.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:56.160
The second was to have faith
that you will be resurrected

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.700
that you will be your Spirit.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:15.720
Now the third stage is today to know
that Realisation gives you experiences

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:22.380
and then your faith is established.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.960
Not blind but open, enlightened faith.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:36.180
For example: you come into this house
and see for yourself what it is

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.520
and then have faith in that, that it is so;

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.180
believe in that, that you’ve seen it,
now you’ve seen, sakshat!

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:59.520
To have sakshat means to get the
whole thing which you have felt

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.800
through your organs,
five organs of perception.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.280
It’s as clear as sunlight!

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:21.289
(Laughter)

00:14:21.289 --> 00:14:33.300
To prove it!

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:44.520
So this faith is the real faith:
no conjecture, no just talking about it.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.380
So all these words that were used
in the scriptures are a revelation.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.380
It means in actual life you have seen
these things happening.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.180
Like I say ‘Ha’ and the Kundalini goes up.&nbsp;

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.427
You’ve seen it many a time.

00:15:25.427 --> 00:15:25.761
I say ‘Ha’ and you start feeling it.

00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:26.412
That only by saying ‘Ha’ and ‘Hu’
and ‘Hee’ you get the vibrations.

00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:26.494
(Laughter)

00:15:26.495 --> 00:15:29.940
It is absolutely there,
now you can see for yourself.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.600
There is no just that it won’t work out
or may work out, may not work out,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.340
may be true, may not be true.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:49.920
All these things are not there.
It’s absolute before you.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.840
But first and foremost is –
you have to become your Spirit.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.140
Without knowing the Spirit
you cannot know God.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.940
But the Spirit itself is a sensitive thing.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:21.420
It is there, no doubt,
it stays there, no doubt.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.860
But that it should shine in your attention,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:32.460
you have to know that your attention
has to be congenial to the Spirit.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:40.100
If the attention is not congenial
then the Spirit doesn’t shine.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:46.440
The Spirit will shine on an attention
which is steady.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:53.440
Steady it.
By balancing you bring a steadiness to it.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:03.900
Balance your thoughts, balance your eyes,
balance your desires. Try to balance it.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:14.400
Ego and superego, you balance it.
Attention is balanced very much like that.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.980
Now how do you do it?
With your will.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.180
First of all you desire and then you act:

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.800
“Where am I going? What am I doing?
I am a seeker.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.840
Is this the thing I have to do
as a seeker?”

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:41.460
Immediately balance will be established.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.840
So this balancing has to come.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:48.420
The foremost thing is to balance yourself.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.480
Any extreme behaviour must be balanced.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.120
Any extreme attitude towards life
must be brought down.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:04.380
Now here we find that the will acts
in an opposite direction.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.980
For example people become obstinate.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:14.880
They do not want to accept
that we have to balance

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.356
and they say, “Oh! I am alright.”

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:22.080
And they’ll give all explanations to show
that they are alright.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.660
But to whom are you
giving the explanations?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.520
You are fighting with yourself. Why?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.720
Because you are not yet integrated
fully within yourself.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:52.260
So the second point is the integration,
integration of your attention.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:06.960
Integration comes in when you do
something, you wish something,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.880
you enjoy something, you want something,

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.580
then you find integration is also wobbly
in your attention.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:42.360
But if you want your Spirit,
you just want your Spirit to be happy.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.380
Because if the Spirit is happy
means you are also happy.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.640
Spirit is always happy.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.560
How are you going to make
the Spirit happy?

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.840
Only thing is when you say you want
the Spirit to be happy,

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.460
what you are saying is this,
that you want your attention to be happy.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.120
If you keep your attention happy
and cheerful,

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:25.020
completely integrated with your being,
not with your ego.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.880
This is where the discretion
has to be used.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:40.620
So from balancing and integration
we go to the third point: is discretion.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.980
Because you are very senior members of
Sahaja Yoga, very senior students.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:55.380
And now you know how to be discreet.
What to take, what not to take.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:01.140
It’s very easy to criticise others.
It’s very easy to say others are wrong.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:10.380
But it should be the easiest to see
what is wrong with you

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.440
because you cannot correct others,
you can only correct yourself.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.460
It’s as simple as that!

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.720
Like a daughter is married to another man.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.140
Now supposing there is any problem
between the two,

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.660
it’s better to tell your daughter
than to tell the other man

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.240
because she is your own.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.720
In the same way it is better to correct
yourself than to correct others.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.600
It’s the easiest thing to correct yourself
if you could look at your ego

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.780
which is stopping it.
And who is the gainer?

00:21:53.340 --> 00:22:02.680
Who is the person who receives the
benediction and the bliss of Sahaja Yoga?

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.180
So the old habits that are within us
which gives us obstinacy

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.100
must be seen with great discretion.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:21.300
And now, with all this training in
Sahaj Yoga, you should be able to see

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.940
even rationally the discretion part of it.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.000
I have seen people who go by the
same road all the time

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.580
are extremely discreet.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:37.920
They know how to turn, which turn
to miss and which turn to take

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.360
and how to reach.
That’s the sign of your maturity.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.500
So you have to be discreet.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.980
Another thing is that you have
your vibrations there

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.140
to teach you discretion.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.700
But sometimes you may be missing them.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:18.840
So with rationality if you discriminate
and try to find out what is wrong,

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.120
“Where am I going wrong?”

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:30.840
You will very easily understand that,
“This part I am doing wrong

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.380
and better check myself and nobody else.”

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.220
Because you are driving your own car.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.260
You can only control your brakes
and not the brakes of another person.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.920
It’s such a funny situation that people
are driving everybody else’s cars

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.760
but not their own!

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:04.080
So with discretion you will know
how to correct yourself, even rationally,

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.780
now your rationality is absolutely logical.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.700
Before this, rationality was illogical.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.920
But now with the integration
your rationality becomes logical

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.920
and it tells you,
“No, this is wrong, this cannot be.”

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.740
You know about everything now,
practically everything.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:36.960
I do not think there is anything
that requires information for you people.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.800
I mean, you just try to think about
something and you will get the answer:

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.260
that’s all in your brains.
It’s opened out.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300
The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.200
only thing that I said:
develop your discretion.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:59.700
If you are indiscreet then you must
develop it, you must grow up with it,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.600
you must mature.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:19.380
So then we go from discretion
to understand that when we go into

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:25.680
discriminate and find out things,
what we have to do is find our own fault,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.560
correct them, discreetly.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.020
And then about others,
what are we to do?

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:43.140
If you people are of that level,
that you catch from even a butterfly

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:49.380
flying around and a little leaf
falling from the tree.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.460
I mean if you were at that level
then I would never have put you into

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.360
big tests. But you are not.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.920
You are capable of much bigger tests
than this.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.300
And it’s nice to play with those,
isn’t it?

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.520
Otherwise why should anybody
even do hitchhiking?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.820
Leave alone hitchhiking,
why should people swim?

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.580
I mean better to sit on the bank
and see everything.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.940
Even why go near the river?
You may catch cold.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.360
So better sit in the house.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.080
And why even put on the light?

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.640
You may see something
and you may get frightened,

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.540
so better to sleep!

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.890
(Laughter)

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.400
Even why to go to sleep,
because you may dream.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120
(Laughter)

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.800
So that situation if it is there,
that touch-me-not business,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.900
then I can tell you we cannot count.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.340
We are soldiers!

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.340
And we have to develop immunity
from all kinds of badhas

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.220
from all kinds of people.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:10.380
Where is Kuli?

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.140
From all types of Sahaja Yogis
coming in.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:19.860
Because this is a wide gate
where everyone has to come, all sorts.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.240
They will have hundred bhoots or
they may have ten thousand – come along!

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.160
Whatever type of bhoots there are
we know how to handle them.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.780
This should be the attitude.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.240
Because I cannot give up anyone.
I have to give chance to everyone.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.700
If you say, “You who discriminate against
these and you throw those people away!”

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.420
I just can’t do it. I am sorry!

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.680
Some people will come, shout at me,
insult me, trouble me.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:01.020
Alright doesn’t matter,
they’ll be alright.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:06.240
I can put them out of circulation
when they are absolutely useless.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.180
But till the end I will have to try.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.540
And if I find a slightest improvement,
I’ll catch on to them.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.720
I may have to work much harder
with them.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.640
They may be much more closer
than other people are.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.220
If they are lost people
I have to look after them.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.960
So you must know that it is
your responsibility

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.620
that you should take your charge
and look after the other things

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.660
that Mother has no time to look after.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.340
That’s what the quality you people are,&nbsp;

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.620
that quality of people.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:29:01.020
All the Gods and all the Angels bow to you.
They are in attention to you.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.780
You have seen even the Sun has come round,
in these clouds, just see,

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.400
surrounded by clouds, it’s there.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.900
Then you have to come up.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:27.820
And a small thing like collectivity:
it’s the beginning of Sahaj Yog.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:34.320
If you do not want to become collective,
Sahaj Yoga is not meant for individuals.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.740
This I must have said at least six years
back, or seven years back in England

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.460
or must be ten years back in India.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.260
Here you are coming to become
a collective being

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.720
because Spirit is the collective being.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.920
The quality of Spirit is that
it is a collective being,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:07.620
is a part of the collective;
it is absolutely one with the collective.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:19.800
It is so collective that you cannot imagine
on human level how much it is collective.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:31.860
For example, yesterday, I was describing
Gita and the Vishuddhi was opening.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.260
Krishna is sitting here and talking
through Me.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:44.820
There is no difference at all of that,
it’s just the same.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.860
And I am Krishna, I am Mataji
and I am Christ.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:03.840
So much one that you can’t imagine
how much oneness is there.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.060
It’s such an unison exists.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:15.300
So for Spirit to be absolutely
enlivened within us,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:22.140
to be absolutely shining within us,
we have to know:

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:29.100
how do we articulate with others?
How do we talk to others?

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.780
What is our way of judging?

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:45.360
But of course, as I said, there are people
with whom you should not bother at all.

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.660
They are not interested in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:55.020
They are anti-God. They are anti-Christ.
Forget them!

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:05.640
They have started another movement
towards hell,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.160
you cannot stop them.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.440
First, start dealing with simpler people.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:24.120
But if anybody comes into my attention,
then you have to accept that person.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.800
But on your own don’t go on wasting
your energy with them.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.180
I do not say that you go to one
of these bhoots’ places

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.320
and you just go and fight with them, no!

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:43.260
If possible, try; if it works out.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:49.680
But do not waste your energy with people,
as Christ has said, “before the swines!”

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:57.180
Because, in the swine all kinds
of parasites live.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:05.160
So in collectivity, those who are
Sahaj Yogis, those who have joined

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:11.340
Sahaj yoga, there should be complete
unison and articulation, absolutely,

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.260
and enjoy each other’s company.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.380
Everyone is a beautiful flower.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:27.120
But I have seen people are more attached
to other people who come in.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.940
Supposing a possessed person comes in:
we had a very good example in India,

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.860
there was a lady who used to come
was possessed.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.520
She would every time come, sit in front,
she would never sit at the back.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.440
And as soon as the tape would start
she would go on like this, like that,

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:57.120
like that. I tried everything on her,
we all tried, she could not be cured.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.580
And she was only interested in doing that.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:03.896
Then she would write poems for Me
and she wanted to read the poems –

00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:05.040
the most embarrassing thing.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.220
I told her, “Don’t read”, because all
bhoots used to come out of her poem.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:13.080
We told her in so many ways
it went on for a year or so,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.400
still she was on and on, and she was just
creating a problem for all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.060
She was just a medium for all these
bhoots to come in.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.260
And I told her many a times,
“You better not come here”.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.060
Then I told her very frankly.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:31.080
Then I said, “You get out from here!”
I went into that level.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.620
Second year passed.
Still she would not listen.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.760
Then I just told her husband that
“If she comes to the programme

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:43.320
we are going to report it to the police”.
So her husband stopped her.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.680
But people have such sympathies
for these bhoots:

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.920
not seeing that she’s going against Mother,
she’s going against Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:58.500
she’s bringing all kinds of bhoots inside
and that why should Mother say all the time

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.520
that she should not come?

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.020
So when I went away
she started coming again.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.040
Everybody told her, “Baba! You don’t come!”
But there were some sympathisers with her!

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.120
“She’s a lady! Why should you
say anything to her?” This and that.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.240
But when she came once,
absolutely adamantly,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.700
people told her, “If you don’t go away,
we’ll throw you out!”

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.660
Still she would not go,
she was just sitting down there.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.080
So one of them kicked her purse outside.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.515
I mean what’s the use of touching
her purse also with your hands, you know –

00:35:29.515 --> 00:35:30.600
this was correct.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.800
And then she got up to catch hold
of her purse,

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.640
because if the purse has gone out
of the place she can’t sit there.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.470
So she rushed out and went away.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.160
And there were letters from there,
“You see. This doesn’t look nice for

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.300
Sahaj Yogis to behave like this and to
throw away the purse like this,

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.780
and this should not have happened
that way, it should not have happened.”

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.940
I said this is indiscreet.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:03.600
If she is a bhoot, you tell her
not to come, she is not wanted there,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.480
she cannot be a Sahaj Yogini,
she is not a seeker,

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:14.400
she is a medium of a bhoot, and still
she is troubling, then who is sympathising?

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.860
Naturally the people who are possessed.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.280
They sympathise with another possessed
person. She is not a Sahaj Yogini.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.160
The collectivity has to be
with the Sahaja Yogis;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.680
not with others.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.020
Because it is not there it’s a fake thing.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.600
It’s like saying,
“We are brothers and sisters.” How are you?

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:52.080
You are not feeling, it’s not awakened
within you.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.620
If a leaf says, “I am the flower,”
does she become?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.680
Leaf is a leaf and a flower is a flower.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:09.960
Among the flowers there should be
collectivity, because that’s the

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:15.180
natural thing that is there existing.
Not with others.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.080
This is one thing which people do not know:
how to discriminate.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.520
You are all one together
but you will fight among each other,

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:32.760
and when as soon as others come in.
It’s surprising, I have seen this happening.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.300
It’s you who are my children.
It’s you who speak the same language.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.960
It’s you who know everything.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.380
You are the people who are coveted.
You are Princes.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:02.820
They still have to become;
that’s a different point.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.060
You sit in your glory.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:13.380
The idea that all the saints should live
at the feet of every third person

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.340
is not there: you are kings,
behave live like kings.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.560
You have to maintain distance from others
who are commoners.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.920
Don’t allow your ego to develop, of course.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:36.240
But know that you won’t enjoy your kingdom
unless and until you get more people

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:43.260
into it. We have to get more and more
and more but keep your dignity.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.220
You are at that level. Keep your poise.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.380
And then deal with others in the same
manner that you are all joined together,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:57.120
you are the same.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:24.540
One has to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:39.815
assuming one’s powers –
assume. There’s no pride.

00:39:39.815 --> 00:39:41.640
There’s no pride in it.
You are that, so you are that:

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.220
what is there to be proud of?

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:53.340
I mean you are realised-souls, finished!
Why to be conscious of it?

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:58.500
You are that. So you are that.&nbsp;

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.200
You are knowledgeable. You are knowledge.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.060
Once you realise that,
then discrimination will work out

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:18.360
much better: that you don’t put down
anyone, you don’t discard anyone,

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.900
but they are not the same as you are.
This principle you must know.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.000
They are not low or high or anything.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.620
But you are different, they are different.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.160
And they have to come and join you.
They have to become.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.880
You cannot become like that,
but they can become like you.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.040
So discretion is very important.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:52.920
In Sahaj Yoga, one of the very great
basics for our growth, is to discriminate.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:03.660
Trust Sahaj Yogis.
Do not trust non-Sahaj Yogis.

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:13.320
Never trust a non-Sahaj Yogi
compared to a Sahaj Yogi.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:22.640
Sahaj Yogi is your brother or sister,
is a companion, is everything

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.980
and the others are others.&nbsp;

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.200
They are another party, you are another party.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.400
They are not your enemies.
They can come to this side

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.840
but they are not the same as you are.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:51.420
This must come into you,
so the collectivity will grow strong.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.960
We should know that, by fighting
with each other,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.580
you are reducing the power of Sahaj Yoga.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.920
By getting angry with each other,
you are reducing the power of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.600
Imagine if the channels start
fighting with each other:

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.360
how are you going to channelise
the energy.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.020
So first of all, make your channel alright.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:29.280
And understand that we all channels
put together are going to do the work

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:37.800
better. We all have to be together.
Togetherness is to be felt.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:50.160
When the collectivity is disturbed
what is the centre you catch?

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:51.660
Can you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.360
tell?

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:00.540
Vishuddhi?

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.012
Vishuddhi and Sahasrara:
because I am the collectivity

00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:05.100
of all the Gods.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:10.560
And all the centres are in the brain,
in the Sahasrara.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:32.580
And thirdly when it goes beyond a certain
level, then you catch on your Heart.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.940
So Vishuddhi, Sahasrara and Heart;
these combinations start.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:45.180
If Agnya left or right,
any one of them joins in,

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:58.080
you develop Ekadasha Rudra.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.380
Now how through Left Vishuddhi and
Right Vishuddhi we spoil other people

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.200
is so evident.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.540
Supposing you have
Right Vishuddhi problem.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:16.920
In Japan, I went there: Japanese people
you know have certain ideas in which

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.860
shyness and shame has no meaning.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:30.840
I mean, a gentleman who is the chairman
of a very big international company

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.280
came to see me in a hotel.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.340
And he had a big thing on his mouth
white some sort of a thing

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.220
like a Hanumana.
And I looked at him, I said,

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.960
“What’s that supposed to be?”

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:48.340
And he talked to me inside
and this thing was on his nose like that.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.960
I saw his Right Vishuddhi
was very badly caught up.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.080
Still I couldn’t understand.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:01.260
So he said, “I am sorry for this Madam,
but this is there because I’ve got cold.”

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:07.620
So they put that thing on,
whether you have to see the Queen

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.980
or anyone they just put on that
and then go and see;

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:22.500
because when you have cold, others catch it.
That’s one thing that catches the fastest.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.260
Now you had cold so I have caught.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:38.460
So to get a cold one learns that
if somebody has a cold, he himself says,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.840
“Today I have got cold, you don’t come!”

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:45.000
If you have to give an excuse to someone
that you don’t want to go anywhere

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.880
you say, “I have got flu!”
“Alright. It’s alright, don’t come!”

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.960
Nobody bothers.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.700
So this is the Right Vishuddhi,
you can see it very clearly.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.680
But Left Vishuddhi you cannot see,
but feel it.

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.780
Left Vishuddhi creates all kinds
of social problems.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:10.800
The Right Vishuddhi creates all kinds
of political problems.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:19.680
For example those who have Right Vishuddhi
are speakers, speak too much.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.460
They have to talk too much.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.200
They may create problems with
their Right Vishuddhi by talking too much

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:30.660
or by keeping quiet, both ways.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:37.500
The Left Vishuddhi people say
something sarcastic, something horrible,

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.540
something nasty, sly:

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.420
non-aggressive but screwing type.

00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:47.058
They might create holes into people.

00:46:47.058 --> 00:46:51.180
They don’t believe in killing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.620
directly
like that. So they want to do screwing up.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.180
Screw the person here and there.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:06.720
The relationship between Right Vishuddhi
and Left Vishuddhi is very close,

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.200
as much as the two sides of a coin.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.380
One side is aggressive,
so on the right hand side when people

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.880
speak to each other they oppress, aggress;
they say things aggressively.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.240
Extremely aggressive things they say.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:32.100
And you have seen people talking like that:
boastful, aggressive things.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.540
Left sided as I told you
are the sly people, so they do it.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.140
They spoil the relationships
by too much aggression, say for example

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.841
one party man will stand up and say that,
“I am the one!”

00:47:47.841 --> 00:47:47.880
The other will say, “I am the one!”

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.880
The relationships between the political
parties are ruined.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.440
They cannot articulate.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.200
The other side is the one which
also cannot articulate.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:08.700
Because the relationship in the slyness
when it goes down too much,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.800
ends up in perverted sex life.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:17.520
Then you go to somebody’s house:
you find a friend came to stay

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.660
and he ran away with the mother-or
some sort of a nonsense like that.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.520
So on the left hand side this kind of a
funny relationship when you do not

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:35.460
understand the purity of relationship
in social life: that drops down,

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.840
that creates problems.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.240
So in relationship Right and
Left Vishuddhi, both of them,

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.440
play a very big part.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:57.900
Then comes the Sahasrara.
You know Sahasrara, what it is.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:04.620
People want to judge Me.
They have a right to do it,

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.220
I mean I cannot say no.
You can judge Me.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:15.900
You can do whatever you like.
I mean, I cannot say that you don’t

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:30.060
judge Me. So we cannot say that
you don’t judge me; I cannot say.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.140
You go on judging Me.

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:36.120
But what is the instrument you have got
to judge Me?

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.480
I am such a camouflage;
just a bubble&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.940
and such a receding

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:50.820
personality. How are you going to judge Me?
Is there a way?

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.660
Is there any way of judging Me?

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:02.280
You can never catch Me, anywhere!
It’s a camouflage.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:10.200
Firstly I am prideless, I am egoless,
I am actionless.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.500
Where are you going to catch Me?

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:23.100
On the contrary by all these attributes
I create a problem for you,

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:24.720
that I am a Mahamaya.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.800
You cannot understand a person
who does not have pride.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.180
Because you all can talk to me very nicely,
you can be very sweet

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.340
and you can just sit next to me.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.240
And suddenly you come out with a remark
which shows you are not conscious

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.200
of whom you are talking to.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.360
Suddenly something you do
where you are not conscious of it.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.220
Because I go on playing.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:59.340
I am extremely friendly with you,
extremely nice to you, absolutely prideless.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:04.920
You see anybody who has even this much
position in life, he has a nose like that.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.520
Mine is bent all the time!

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:12.960
(Laughter)

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.460
Nothing but humour.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.380
And then how are you going to understand
my position?

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:28.080
You see there is no outside signs,
there are no horns,

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.160
there’s nothing that I could be
a cinema star.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:41.100
I am too simple, too sweet.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:50.400
There is no way by which you can
really feel that I am great.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.100
I am absolutely mundane, ordinary.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.760
But extraordinary of the ordinary I am.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.000
This is a thing which people
do not understand.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.520
It’s alright for those who are
not realised, excused.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:21.900
But you have felt the vibrations
and your Realisation through me:

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.700
I must be something.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:26.280
Put your attention like that,
to understand.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:31.080
Must be a tremendous thing
inside this body.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:39.480
It cannot be possible otherwise.
It’s so obvious otherwise to you people.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:51.240
This is to be understood that, so far,
Krishna, Christ, Rama, all of them,

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:57.533
nobody gave Self-realisation
to people en-masse.

00:52:57.533 --> 00:53:02.083
They had other powers Samharashakti,
like Krishna had,

00:53:02.082 --> 00:53:08.100
he could kill anybody like this.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:17.160
I have also all these powers hidden,
but obviously I am a very simple,

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.340
ordinary, mundane type of an Indian lady,
finished!

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:35.820
And Christ had a power to get
Himself crucified. I too have that.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.920
But I am not going to do all that.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:46.680
I have a power to resurrect also.&nbsp;

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.680
Why these powers are not used?

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.780
One should understand.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:56.100
Because now the main attention
is to raise the Kundalini

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.440
and for that these powers are not required.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.940
Give Realisation to any number
of people.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.604
What’s the use of getting crucified?

00:54:05.604 --> 00:54:08.280
Who is going to raise the Kundalini?
I would like to wait.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.560
I mean, if I were at that time
I would have said,

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.020
“Alright, keep your cross for a while
I will have it later on.”

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:24.420
What’s the need, just now,
to destroy people?

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:30.480
Let’s see how many come around.
So these powers are not required.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.040
Today the power of raising the Kundalini
of thousands &amp; thousands and millions

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.380
&amp; millions of people is required.

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.580
And I am going to be just like you
all my life: in the sense I am going to get

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.320
old. I mean, today I should be old,
I will be.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.300
I’ll be just like you.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:00.240
I am not going to do anything outside.
It’s like a German car!

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.380
But it is you, who has to know
the power of the German car.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.460
It’s the best type!

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:24.060
And once you realise that, that all is
deliberately made like that…

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.291
In the beginning of course,
you cannot even understand it.

00:55:25.291 --> 00:55:26.220
It goes on, “How can it be?
How can it be?

00:55:26.220 --> 00:55:34.380
She does this, She does that.”
It goes on like that.

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:41.400
But don’t judge me, because that’s not
the way you will understand.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:49.980
Just realise and recognise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:52.500
that
there has to be something tremendous.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:56:01.200
It was necessary to have someone like that
to do this tremendous task.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:10.020
And it was necessary for you to be born,
to be with me to help me.

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:14.580
I know those who are with me;
they’ll stand by me throughout.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.240
I may judge them a little here and there,
but I know they’ll come round.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.260
They have to stand by me.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:31.740
Those who want to run away,
they’ll run away, today or tomorrow, I know.

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:36.300
I’ll try. I’ll try to get them round
as far as possible.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:51.960
So, we come to collectivity,
to understand that you are cells

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.160
in my body and I have awakened you.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:02.280
If you degenerate, my body degenerates.
You have seen that also.

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.740
When you are sick, I am sick.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.400
In the sense I liberate more vibrations
and I feel sick with that,

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:21.780
because you can’t take it.
When you take vibrations I feel very happy.

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:27.000
But those who have faith in themselves
can only understand this.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.380
Those who have superiority complex,
or inferiority complex cannot.

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:32.880
Complex means no faith in yourself.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.500
You should have faith in yourself that
you are the chosen ones.

00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.360
You are really the people, specially made
for this great work.

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.620
It’s a tremendous thing that you are out for.&nbsp;

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:54.940
Once you realise and recognise it

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.740
you won’t bother about small,
small things of life.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:13.560
It’s the quality in you that has to be
nurtured and looked after,

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.480
through collectivity.

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.960
But collectivity of the Sahaj Yogis.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.960
I know those who have proper reactions
to things.

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:38.220
Some Sahaj Yogi is coming,
they feel very happy, “Oh he’s coming!”

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:42.280
You say, “There are five people who got
Realisation,” they feel very happy.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:48.120
They will not shun. They’ll be happy
to go all out to see a Sahaj Yogi,

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:51.940
to meet a Sahaj Yogi,
to do anything for a Sahaj Yogi.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:58.920
This is the sign of a Sahaj Yogi.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.720
A Sahaja Yogi in difficulty,
he’ll go secretly and help,

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.420
not just on money but anything.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.100
This is a new race that is coming up.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.840
Others are human beings, you are not.

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:29.580
You are not human beings any more.
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.200
It’s a different race.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.260
All over the world this race has to come up.
So we have to build up ourselves

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:49.500
in one group, in one understanding,
in absolute unison.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.480
There should be no secrets, there should
be no domination,

00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.360
everything should articulate, everyone
should talk to each other,

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.180
everyone should know what is happening
with the what.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:13.680
You have to be absolutely frank,
open with each other. Absolutely.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.240
Tell them your problems.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.900
“I catch on this, what to do?
I catch on that, what to do?

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:26.040
How to clear it out?” Not to feel shy.
We have to enjoy ourselves.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:34.620
Also enjoy our weaknesses
so that we clear them out.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:40.020
Laugh it out. If somebody has some habits –
laugh it out. That’s the best way to do it.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:49.020
The difference between a human being and a
Sahaj Yogi is the same as a human being

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.400
and a drunk fellow.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.760
I’ll give you a joke of a drunkard:&nbsp;

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:05.580
there were two drunkards who were drunk

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.160
and went to a hotel.

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.580
And they wanted to have a room
for themselves.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.680
God knows what they wanted,
they did not know.

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:20.700
So they went and told the clerk
that they would like to have

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.880
two beds with a room.
He didn’t understand you see.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.700
No, two rooms with a bed.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:34.440
So he said, “All right, you want to have
a room with two beds. All right.”

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:40.860
So he opened a room and said
these are the beds for you.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.340
So fully clothed as they were,
they slept in the same bed.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:51.480
So one calls to another and says,
“There’s somebody in my bed!”

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:58.380
So the other one says,&nbsp;

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.160
“I too have someone in my bed.”

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.620
(Laughter)

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.300
So the first one says,
“What should we do?”

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.740
The second one says,
“Let’s try to throw them out!”

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:26.640
And there was a big struggle
and lot of noise in the room.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:29.160
So the first one says
“I’ve got him out.”

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.500
The second one says,
“But he has thrown me out!”

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.587
(Laughter)

01:02:35.587 --> 01:02:42.000
So the first one says “All right,
you can come and sleep with me,”

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.120
because he’s thrown him out,
so what to do?

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.920
This is what they are!
This&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.460
is the difference.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.980
So what is the use of arguing with them
and getting angry, getting into tensions.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:04.260
I mean they are blind!

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:09.780
If you see a drunkard,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.480
run with the speed
of five hundred miles per hour.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.540
That’s my principle.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:20.280
No use arguing with a mad man
or a drunkard.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.000
Maybe mad man maybe alright,
but a drunkard, till three hours

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.440
he won’t digest his drinks.

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.960
So that is what is the difference.
They are drunk.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.000
They are drunk by power, drunk by money,
drunk by that.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.380
Something is there.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.900
And you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:51.120
filled with the light
of God Almighty.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.880
That is what it is: the difference is.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.920
If you understand the difference,
you will realise that

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.540
no use fighting with these people.
They are drunk. They are like that.

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:16.920
If you talk to them, what can you say?
I mean, they don’t understand you.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.080
They just don’t understand, so forget it.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.200
I will give you such tests and things
by which you will come in contact

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:35.700
with them, see them and get out of it,
without any harm being done to you.

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.200
It’s necessary. You have to touch them.
You have to go near them.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.860
You have to be with them.
But you are outside.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:48.600
I give such tests to people
and that should work out!

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.060
And I know you can, that’s why I give.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:56.040
I give such tests only to people
about whom I’m sure that they’ll come out.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:09.060
With this, I think, we should decide today
that, we all are going to live

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:23.640
with one heart, one desire,
with one head and with one liver, all of us.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.660
Let’s see how it works out.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.160
For example, you go to a hotel,
five Sahaj Yogis.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.620
If one says, “I’ll have that,”
everybody will have that.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:41.160
That’s the sign. No decisions are needed.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.100
Why waste energy on decisions, arguments?

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.800
Whether you eat fish and chips
or chips and fish is just the same.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.107
The quarrel is like that.

01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:58.380
A Sahaj Yogi does not waste his energies
on these things.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:05.580
You have seen your Mother: no choices,
just enjoyment.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:13.620
Where is the time to argue?&nbsp;

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:18.240
When joy pouring in, let’s enjoy.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:23.760
May God bless you all!

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.960
See, why is the problem?

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:40.380
That you have a will, that anything else
does not have the will.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.880
You have the will.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:50.700
And once you try to bring the will
in tune with each other,

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.420
you feel your ego is there
and your ego hurts you.

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:58.520
You don’t want to be,
you don’t want to lose that.

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:06.240
You think that, by doing so,
you are becoming sub-normal. No!

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:19.080
You are a Realised soul, and a Realised
soul is something so unique

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.300
that you cannot give a parallel to it.&nbsp;

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.460
You cannot give a parallel.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:32.100
For example, I can say, if there’s a
wind blowing then all the trees

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.540
move in the same way. But human beings,
if the wind is blowing,

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:39.960
supposing any wind is coming, somebody
will go that way, somebody will go

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.280
that way, because they have a will.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:48.420
But Sahaja Yogis, if the wind is blowing,
all of them will put their heads

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.860
against the wind and fight it.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:08:00.060
This is a thing which cannot be given
any parallel because you are going above

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.700
human things. So far never such a thing
has existed.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:10.080
You are such unique creations that
I cannot compare you with anything

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:15.900
that was below, or I should say,
which was not of this level.

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.980
The level is different.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:30.000
So when you do everything the same way,
you are doing it because you are aware

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:38.820
of that collectivity, of the Primordial
Being within you, that’s why you are doing.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:42.240
This transition is the point which
you should catch.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:49.380
That’s something I feel, that when you
start giving any analogies and all that,

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:53.400
how can you give an analogy for something
that never existed before, never?

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.400
Atula,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.680
which cannot be compared.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.420
That’s one of the names of the Goddess.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:12.180
So, I cannot give you analogies,
but I can make you understand

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.380
that if your Spirit is awakened –
in everybody is the Spirit

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:23.100
which is a collective being –
then you do it because your Spirit does it.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.120
You don’t care for ego, superego and all
these nonsensical things,

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:37.440
which are barriers in the growth
of living collectivity.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.320
Now you have become livingly collective
and you cannot be happy otherwise.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:52.020
You are that. It’s a new being
that is within you. So you cannot.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.820
If you try to do something else,
you will not like it,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.540
because this time is not your ego
but your Spirit.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:04.380
As before this you listened to your ego
and were happy with it,

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.320
now you will be happy if you listen
to your Spirit.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.100
Because now you have become the Spirit.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.520
It’s a very unique situation.
You are the Spirit.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:20.820
And when you are the Spirit,
then you become different.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.040
What analogy can I give?

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:32.400
Then the responsibility is more also
to understand that, when you say yes,

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.060
another says yes. See in saying yes,
you will feel happy.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.310
Supposing you say “fish &amp; chips”, another
says, “fish &amp; chips”, another will say

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:43.980
“fish &amp; chips” Everybody will say the same.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.420
“Let’s go to the right!”
“Let’s go to the right!”

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.140
“Let’s go to the right!”
Everybody will say.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.820
Unless and until there is somebody
who knows the job and says,

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.180
“No, no. Right is not, the way.
Left let’s go.”

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.505
Everybody should know that he knows the way.
“Yes, let’s go to the left.”

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:09.720
Arguments will fizzle out,
because you are in unison.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:14.760
In the second half, I’ll have to tell you
about the nourishment of Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.920
That will be the second half.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:23.220
But the first half is the basics,
which I have talked to you.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:29.520
So, you would like them to come
for lunch also?

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.290
Yes Mother.
