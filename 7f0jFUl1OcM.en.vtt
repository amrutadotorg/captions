00:00:00.801 --> 00:00:03.513
… in life.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:10.662
In the same way the vibrations, the
vibrations are coming, they are radiated.

00:00:10.863 --> 00:00:13.057
What you have to do is to expose yourself
to it.

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:16.991
The best is not to put in any effort.

00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:19.758
Don’t worry at what point you have
a problem.

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:21.973
Say, many people during meditation,
I have seen

00:00:22.173 --> 00:00:25.734
if they catch somewhere they go on looking
after it.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.300
You just don’t have to worry. You just let
it go

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:33.315
and it will work by itself.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.002
Is going easy?

00:00:49.224 --> 00:00:52.501
So you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:54.576
This is what meditation is.

00:00:54.784 --> 00:01:00.491
Meditation means exposing yourself
to God’s grace.

00:01:00.692 --> 00:01:03.958
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.727
It knows how to mend you, how to settle
down itself into your own being,

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:15.669
keep your Spirit kindled. It knows
everything.

00:01:16.772 --> 00:01:21.866
So you don’t have to worry as to what
you have to do

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:25.139
or what name you have to take, what mantras
you have to do.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.387
In meditation you have to be absolutely
effortless,

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:33.343
[aside: “Sit down”], expose yourself fully

00:01:33.544 --> 00:01:39.201
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless
at that time.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:43.682
Supposing there’s a possibility, you may
not be thoughtless.

00:01:43.883 --> 00:01:46.220
At that time you have to just watch
your thoughts,

00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:48.544
but don’t get involved into them.

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:54.599
You will find gradually as the sun rises,
the darkness goes away

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.000
and the sun’s rays go into every crevice
and every part

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:03.456
and makes the whole place lighted.

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:06.873
In the same way your being will be
completely lighted.

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:09.291
But if you put in an effort that time

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.678
or try to stop something within you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.238
or try to give it a bandhan
it will know.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:20.255
Effortlessness is the only way
to meditation,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.059
but you should not be lethargic about it –

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.061
should be alert and watch it.

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.864
The other side could be people just
doze off.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:33.360
No! You have to be alert. If you doze off,
nothing will work.

00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:39.711
That’s another side of it is. If you are
lazy about it, nothing will work.

00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:48.083
You have to be alert and opened, absolutely
aware,

00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:53.049
completely effortless – absolutely
effortless.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.730
If you are absolutely effortless,
meditation will work the best.

00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:01.493
Don’t think of your problems at all,

00:03:01.694 --> 00:03:04.399
whatever chakras you have, anything.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.428
Just expose yourself.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.020
See when the sun shines, all the nature
exposes itself to the sun

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.381
and receives the blessings of the sun,
effortlessly.

00:03:15.582 --> 00:03:19.667
It doesn’t put in any effort, it just
receives itself.

00:03:19.868 --> 00:03:28.676
When it receives the sun’s rays, then the
sun’s ray’s start acting and activating.

00:03:31.562 --> 00:03:39.172
In the same way, the All-Pervading Power
starts working.

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:42.983
You are not to manoeuvre it. You are not
to do anything about it.

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:47.569
Just be effortless, absolutely effortless.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.580
Don’t take any names. Do not bother
if your Agnya is catching,

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:55.204
this is catching, that is catching. It is
working out.

00:03:55.405 --> 00:04:00.140
It will go on working as long as it can

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:07.488
and it will do the miracle that it has
to do. You don’t have to worry about it.

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.109
It knows its job.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.542
But when you put in an effort actually
you create a barrier for it.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:15.993
So no effort is needed,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.164
be absolutely effortless and say

00:04:18.364 --> 00:04:22.567
‘Let it go, let it go’ – that’s all.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.559
No mantra’s to be chanted,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.517
in case you find it’s impossible – then
you can take my name,

00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:29.233
but there is no need even.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:31.334
When you put your hand towards me
that’s the mantra,

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:35.437
sufficient, this gesture itself is
the mantra.

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:42.805
You see there’s no need to say it more, but
the thought in the mind, the emotion

00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:48.134
should be that we have to now spread our
hands to that and it should work.

00:04:48.335 --> 00:04:53.490
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.962
there is no need to say any mantra,
you go beyond it.

00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:02.732
So, one has to be absolutely effortless,

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.545
absolutely effortless. That is what it is.

00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:20.366
Meditation is for your own ascent,

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:25.635
is for your own capital gains that you
have to have.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:30.690
But once you get into it, you also achieve
your powers.

00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:35.553
Like, you become a governor then you get
the powers of the governor.

00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:39.513
At this time you don’t have to think about
anybody else.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.620
You are not to put your attention
to anybody else

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:46.957
but just receive it, just receive it.

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.754
Do not think of any other problem,

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:57.788
but that, that you have to be effortless,
absolutely effortless.

00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:10.055
It would work best on the people who are
just receiving it.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.042
You have problems – that’s why you are
here,

00:06:13.243 --> 00:06:18.401
but you cannot solve them, they are to be
solved by Divine Power.

00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:23.886
This must be understood fully, that we
cannot solve our problems.

00:06:24.087 --> 00:06:31.427
It is beyond us to solve our problems.

00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:37.288
So leave it in the hands of the Divine
Power

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:43.334
and expose yourself effortlessly,
absolutely effortlessly.

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:49.246
Sit in comfort, and properly with both
the feet on the ground,

00:06:49.447 --> 00:06:53.656
with both the hands relaxed like this.

00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:56.857
Be comfortable, you should not be
uncomfortable at all.

00:06:57.058 --> 00:07:02.800
Be very comfortable, you see, because you
have to sit for quite some time.

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:08.774
And you try to put your attention to me,
within yourself,

00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:11.984
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:15.927
You can come into my Kundalini and it will
be done.

00:07:16.128 --> 00:07:20.408
Good, just like this, the hands should be
like this, straight.

00:07:26.853 --> 00:07:31.692
So effortlessness is the key word,
absolutely effortlessly,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.912
whether you are meditating before me,
or before my photograph.
