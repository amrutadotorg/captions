00:00.801 --> 00:03.513
… in life.

00:03.714 --> 00:10.662
In the same way the vibrations, the
vibrations are coming, they are radiated.

00:10.863 --> 00:13.057
What you have to do is to expose yourself
to it.

00:13.258 --> 00:16.991
The best is not to put in any effort.

00:17.207 --> 00:19.758
Don’t worry at what point you have
a problem.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.973
Say, many people during meditation,
I have seen

00:22.173 --> 00:25.734
if they catch somewhere they go on looking
after it.

00:25.935 --> 00:29.300
You just don’t have to worry. You just let
it go

00:29.501 --> 00:33.315
and it will work by itself.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.002
Is going easy?

00:49.224 --> 00:52.501
So you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:52.702 --> 00:54.576
This is what meditation is.

00:54.784 --> 01:00.491
Meditation means exposing yourself
to God’s grace.

01:00.692 --> 01:03.958
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

01:04.159 --> 01:09.727
It knows how to mend you, how to settle
down itself into your own being,

01:09.928 --> 01:15.669
keep your Spirit kindled. It knows
everything.

01:16.772 --> 01:21.866
So you don’t have to worry as to what
you have to do

01:22.067 --> 01:25.139
or what name you have to take, what mantras
you have to do.

01:25.340 --> 01:28.387
In meditation you have to be absolutely
effortless,

01:28.588 --> 01:33.343
[aside: “Sit down”], expose yourself fully

01:33.544 --> 01:39.201
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless
at that time.

01:39.401 --> 01:43.682
Supposing there’s a possibility, you may
not be thoughtless.

01:43.883 --> 01:46.220
At that time you have to just watch
your thoughts,

01:46.421 --> 01:48.544
but don’t get involved into them.

01:48.745 --> 01:54.599
You will find gradually as the sun rises,
the darkness goes away

01:54.800 --> 01:59.000
and the sun’s rays go into every crevice
and every part

01:59.201 --> 02:03.456
and makes the whole place lighted.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.873
In the same way your being will be
completely lighted.

02:07.074 --> 02:09.291
But if you put in an effort that time

02:09.491 --> 02:11.678
or try to stop something within you

02:11.879 --> 02:15.238
or try to give it a bandhan
it will know.

02:15.439 --> 02:20.255
Effortlessness is the only way
to meditation,

02:20.660 --> 02:23.059
but you should not be lethargic about it –

02:23.260 --> 02:26.061
should be alert and watch it.

02:26.262 --> 02:28.864
The other side could be people just
doze off.

02:29.065 --> 02:33.360
No! You have to be alert. If you doze off,
nothing will work.

02:33.561 --> 02:39.711
That’s another side of it is. If you are
lazy about it, nothing will work.

02:40.311 --> 02:48.083
You have to be alert and opened, absolutely
aware,

02:48.284 --> 02:53.049
completely effortless – absolutely
effortless.

02:53.250 --> 02:58.730
If you are absolutely effortless,
meditation will work the best.

02:58.931 --> 03:01.493
Don’t think of your problems at all,

03:01.694 --> 03:04.399
whatever chakras you have, anything.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.428
Just expose yourself.

03:06.629 --> 03:12.020
See when the sun shines, all the nature
exposes itself to the sun

03:12.221 --> 03:15.381
and receives the blessings of the sun,
effortlessly.

03:15.582 --> 03:19.667
It doesn’t put in any effort, it just
receives itself.

03:19.868 --> 03:28.676
When it receives the sun’s rays, then the
sun’s ray’s start acting and activating.

03:31.562 --> 03:39.172
In the same way, the All-Pervading Power
starts working.

03:39.373 --> 03:42.983
You are not to manoeuvre it. You are not
to do anything about it.

03:43.184 --> 03:47.569
Just be effortless, absolutely effortless.

03:47.770 --> 03:51.580
Don’t take any names. Do not bother
if your Agnya is catching,

03:51.781 --> 03:55.204
this is catching, that is catching. It is
working out.

03:55.405 --> 04:00.140
It will go on working as long as it can

04:00.341 --> 04:07.488
and it will do the miracle that it has
to do. You don’t have to worry about it.

04:07.689 --> 04:09.109
It knows its job.

04:09.310 --> 04:13.542
But when you put in an effort actually
you create a barrier for it.

04:13.742 --> 04:15.993
So no effort is needed,

04:16.209 --> 04:18.164
be absolutely effortless and say

04:18.364 --> 04:22.567
‘Let it go, let it go’ – that’s all.

04:22.980 --> 04:24.559
No mantra’s to be chanted,

04:24.760 --> 04:27.517
in case you find it’s impossible – then
you can take my name,

04:27.718 --> 04:29.233
but there is no need even.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.334
When you put your hand towards me
that’s the mantra,

04:31.535 --> 04:35.437
sufficient, this gesture itself is
the mantra.

04:35.638 --> 04:42.805
You see there’s no need to say it more, but
the thought in the mind, the emotion

04:43.006 --> 04:48.134
should be that we have to now spread our
hands to that and it should work.

04:48.335 --> 04:53.490
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

04:53.981 --> 04:58.962
there is no need to say any mantra,
you go beyond it.

05:00.293 --> 05:02.732
So, one has to be absolutely effortless,

05:02.939 --> 05:08.545
absolutely effortless. That is what it is.

05:16.243 --> 05:20.366
Meditation is for your own ascent,

05:20.567 --> 05:25.635
is for your own capital gains that you
have to have.

05:25.836 --> 05:30.690
But once you get into it, you also achieve
your powers.

05:30.891 --> 05:35.553
Like, you become a governor then you get
the powers of the governor.

05:35.754 --> 05:39.513
At this time you don’t have to think about
anybody else.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.620
You are not to put your attention
to anybody else

05:42.821 --> 05:46.957
but just receive it, just receive it.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.754
Do not think of any other problem,

05:49.955 --> 05:57.788
but that, that you have to be effortless,
absolutely effortless.

06:03.001 --> 06:10.055
It would work best on the people who are
just receiving it.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.042
You have problems – that’s why you are
here,

06:13.243 --> 06:18.401
but you cannot solve them, they are to be
solved by Divine Power.

06:18.602 --> 06:23.886
This must be understood fully, that we
cannot solve our problems.

06:24.087 --> 06:31.427
It is beyond us to solve our problems.

06:31.628 --> 06:37.288
So leave it in the hands of the Divine
Power

06:37.489 --> 06:43.334
and expose yourself effortlessly,
absolutely effortlessly.

06:43.535 --> 06:49.246
Sit in comfort, and properly with both
the feet on the ground,

06:49.447 --> 06:53.656
with both the hands relaxed like this.

06:53.857 --> 06:56.857
Be comfortable, you should not be
uncomfortable at all.

06:57.058 --> 07:02.800
Be very comfortable, you see, because you
have to sit for quite some time.

07:05.618 --> 07:08.774
And you try to put your attention to me,
within yourself,

07:08.975 --> 07:11.984
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

07:12.185 --> 07:15.927
You can come into my Kundalini and it will
be done.

07:16.128 --> 07:20.408
Good, just like this, the hands should be
like this, straight.

07:26.853 --> 07:31.692
So effortlessness is the key word,
absolutely effortlessly,

07:31.900 --> 07:37.912
whether you are meditating before me,
or before my photograph.
