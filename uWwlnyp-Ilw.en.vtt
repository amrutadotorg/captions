00:00:04.264 --> 00:00:11.905
Experience of the Awakening
of the Kundalini Energy

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.850
Guided by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
1987-0505, Australia

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.493
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.379
All the time, the left hand is towards Me.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.820
Now. Here you have to say, in your heart,

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:50.747
with all sincerity, you have to ask Me
a question.

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:57.094
You have to ask Me a question,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:01.791
If you want to call Me ‘Shri Mataji’ you
can call that, or you can call Me ‘Mother’,

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:04.934
but whichever way you want to call,
that’s not important.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:08.686
You have to say, “Mother,
am I the Spirit?”.

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:11.514
Ask the question three times in your heart.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:17.726
This is a very fundamental question. Like
a computer you are asking Me a question.

00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:49.618
Now bring the right hand onto the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.287
Here press it. Now this is the centre
of your mastery, your guidance,

00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:04.835
your Guru Tattwa as they say. So ask
a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

00:02:05.036 --> 00:02:11.063
This is a question to be asked three times,
“Mother, am I my own master?”.

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:32.881
Now, bring your right hand down below,
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:42.174
Now this is the centre from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.346
all the pure work is done.

00:02:45.547 --> 00:02:51.457
Now this centre is such that you have
to ask Me that,

00:02:51.658 --> 00:02:58.343
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:05.614
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”
If you do not ask, I cannot force on you.

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:10.766
So to ask Me six times, because
this centre has got six petals.

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:15.010
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:20.389
This works out all the Divine plans.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.763
Six times you just ask.

00:03:23.964 --> 00:03:29.151
As a result of this asking, the Kundalini
starts getting awakened.

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:44.553
Now to help the Kundalini to rise,
you have to cooperate with her.

00:03:44.753 --> 00:03:48.893
So please, put your right hand
on the left-hand side,

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:54.726
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it,

00:03:55.447 --> 00:03:57.973
on your – is the stomach.

00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:06.126
Now here you have to say with full
confidence, to help the Kundalini to rise,

00:04:06.327 --> 00:04:12.759
“Mother, I am my own master.”
This you have to say ten times.

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:16.176
These are the Ten Commandments
which you have to say, that,

00:04:16.377 --> 00:04:21.082
“Mother, I am my own master.”

00:04:57.366 --> 00:05:04.649
Now - ten times with full confidence.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.881
Now, please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:20.584
Now, here you have to say, again
with full confidence,

00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:25.460
“Mother, I am the Spirit.” This is
the truth, you are the Spirit,

00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:31.898
but you have to say with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.652
This you have to say twelve times.

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:10.294
Now, one has to know that God Almighty
is the Ocean of Love.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:15.099
But above all, He’s the Ocean
of Forgiveness.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.651
So He forgives; whatever wrong
you do He forgives.

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:26.007
So don’t feel guilty and put your
right hand across,

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:35.800
on the left-hand side, in the corner which
is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:41.495
Now here you have to say, again
with full confidence, sixteen times,

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.685
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Please say it,

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:49.701
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Sixteen times.

00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:53.866
“I’m not guilty at all.”

00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:56.425
Please say it.

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.699
Please say it.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.957
Baba, very hot.

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:36.117
Now raise your hand across
on your forehead.

00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.017
Now this is the centre of Christ

00:07:41.142 --> 00:07:44.668
and is a very important centre.

00:07:45.935 --> 00:07:51.002
Here you have to say from your heart,

00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:57.223
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please
say it from your heart.

00:07:57.424 --> 00:08:03.652
How many times is not the point.
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:07.342
Now, some would say that is very difficult
to forgive.

00:08:07.543 --> 00:08:13.333
But it’s a myth that we do not forgive
or we forgive.

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:16.183
We do not do anything in both the cases.

00:08:16.384 --> 00:08:20.286
But if we don’t forgive, then we play
into wrong hands.

00:08:20.487 --> 00:08:27.612
So please say from your heart,
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:39.598
Now please take your hand
on the Back Agnya, the same centre

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:44.831
on the backside of your head, and allow
your head to rest on it

00:08:45.032 --> 00:08:47.761
and push it back a little bit.

00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:52.098
Now here you have to say -

00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:57.569
for your satisfaction because you always
feel guilty - that,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.458
“Oh, Divine, if I have done anything wrong,
please forgive me.”

00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:12.483
“Please, forgive me.”

00:09:14.572 --> 00:09:17.060
From your heart.

00:09:18.332 --> 00:09:22.672
Now to the fontanel bone area, where
they say they give baptism,

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:26.530
but actually it’s an artificial one.

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:34.725
Stretch your hand fully and put your centre
of your palm on top

00:09:34.926 --> 00:09:42.617
of the fontanel bone area, which was
a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:09:42.818 --> 00:09:47.304
Press it hard, press hard your scalp.

00:09:47.505 --> 00:09:51.638
Now you have to move it seven times,
saying one thing,

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:57.159
which you have to ask for, “Mother, please,
give us my Self-realization.”

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.458
Because I cannot force on you, so you’ve
to ask for it.

00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:07.652
Seven times, press it hard and move it
seven times. Very hard.

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:14.351
Slowly. Saying that.

00:10:26.367 --> 00:10:28.714
It’s good.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:08.754
Now, remove the right hand.

00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:13.912
Slowly open your eyes.

00:11:14.597 --> 00:11:19.164
Put your right hand towards Me and see
on your left-hand.

00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:21.545
Raise it a little higher than your head

00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:26.867
and see if there’s the cool breeze
is coming out of your head.

00:11:27.068 --> 00:11:30.487
Some people might get it. Put the right
hand towards Me please,

00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:34.373
right hand towards Me. And with
the left hand -

00:11:34.574 --> 00:11:37.709
right hand towards Me - with the left hand.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:43.593
Just see if there’s a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

00:11:52.554 --> 00:11:58.169
Now turn it, put left hand towards Me.
See with your right hand.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.160
Some people might get hot breeze.
It’s alright.

00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:17.264
But after some time it will become cool.
