00:04.264 --> 00:11.905
Experience of the Awakening
of the Kundalini Energy

00:16.600 --> 00:24.850
Guided by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
1987-0505, Australia

00:30.871 --> 00:35.493
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:35.702 --> 00:39.379
All the time, the left hand is towards Me.

00:39.580 --> 00:45.820
Now. Here you have to say, in your heart,

00:46.021 --> 00:50.747
with all sincerity, you have to ask Me
a question.

00:50.948 --> 00:57.094
You have to ask Me a question,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

00:57.295 --> 01:01.791
If you want to call Me ‘Shri Mataji’ you
can call that, or you can call Me ‘Mother’,

01:01.992 --> 01:04.934
but whichever way you want to call,
that’s not important.

01:05.135 --> 01:08.686
You have to say, “Mother,
am I the Spirit?”.

01:08.887 --> 01:11.514
Ask the question three times in your heart.

01:11.715 --> 01:17.726
This is a very fundamental question. Like
a computer you are asking Me a question.

01:38.591 --> 01:49.618
Now bring the right hand onto the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

01:50.789 --> 01:58.287
Here press it. Now this is the centre
of your mastery, your guidance,

01:58.488 --> 02:04.835
your Guru Tattwa as they say. So ask
a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

02:05.036 --> 02:11.063
This is a question to be asked three times,
“Mother, am I my own master?”.

02:24.802 --> 02:32.881
Now, bring your right hand down below,
in the lower part of the abdomen.

02:34.771 --> 02:42.174
Now this is the centre from which
all the Divine work is done,

02:42.375 --> 02:45.346
all the pure work is done.

02:45.547 --> 02:51.457
Now this centre is such that you have
to ask Me that,

02:51.658 --> 02:58.343
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”

02:59.885 --> 03:05.614
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”
If you do not ask, I cannot force on you.

03:05.815 --> 03:10.766
So to ask Me six times, because
this centre has got six petals.

03:10.967 --> 03:15.010
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge.”

03:15.211 --> 03:20.389
This works out all the Divine plans.

03:20.590 --> 03:23.763
Six times you just ask.

03:23.964 --> 03:29.151
As a result of this asking, the Kundalini
starts getting awakened.

03:40.588 --> 03:44.553
Now to help the Kundalini to rise,
you have to cooperate with her.

03:44.753 --> 03:48.893
So please, put your right hand
on the left-hand side,

03:49.094 --> 03:54.726
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it,

03:55.447 --> 03:57.973
on your – is the stomach.

03:58.151 --> 04:06.126
Now here you have to say with full
confidence, to help the Kundalini to rise,

04:06.327 --> 04:12.759
“Mother, I am my own master.”
This you have to say ten times.

04:12.967 --> 04:16.176
These are the Ten Commandments
which you have to say, that,

04:16.377 --> 04:21.082
“Mother, I am my own master.”

04:57.366 --> 05:04.649
Now - ten times with full confidence.

05:04.850 --> 05:09.881
Now, please raise your right hand
to your heart.

05:13.859 --> 05:20.584
Now, here you have to say, again
with full confidence,

05:20.785 --> 05:25.460
“Mother, I am the Spirit.” This is
the truth, you are the Spirit,

05:25.661 --> 05:31.898
but you have to say with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

05:32.099 --> 05:35.652
This you have to say twelve times.

06:03.325 --> 06:10.294
Now, one has to know that God Almighty
is the Ocean of Love.

06:10.495 --> 06:15.099
But above all, He’s the Ocean
of Forgiveness.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.651
So He forgives; whatever wrong
you do He forgives.

06:19.852 --> 06:26.007
So don’t feel guilty and put your
right hand across,

06:27.459 --> 06:35.800
on the left-hand side, in the corner which
is made by your neck and your shoulder.

06:36.001 --> 06:41.495
Now here you have to say, again
with full confidence, sixteen times,

06:41.696 --> 06:44.685
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Please say it,

06:44.886 --> 06:49.701
“Mother, I am not guilty.” Sixteen times.

06:50.656 --> 06:53.866
“I’m not guilty at all.”

06:54.338 --> 06:56.425
Please say it.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.699
Please say it.

07:21.600 --> 07:26.957
Baba, very hot.

07:32.133 --> 07:36.117
Now raise your hand across
on your forehead.

07:36.351 --> 07:40.017
Now this is the centre of Christ

07:41.142 --> 07:44.668
and is a very important centre.

07:45.935 --> 07:51.002
Here you have to say from your heart,

07:51.203 --> 07:57.223
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please
say it from your heart.

07:57.424 --> 08:03.652
How many times is not the point.
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

08:03.869 --> 08:07.342
Now, some would say that is very difficult
to forgive.

08:07.543 --> 08:13.333
But it’s a myth that we do not forgive
or we forgive.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.183
We do not do anything in both the cases.

08:16.384 --> 08:20.286
But if we don’t forgive, then we play
into wrong hands.

08:20.487 --> 08:27.612
So please say from your heart,
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

08:35.033 --> 08:39.598
Now please take your hand
on the Back Agnya, the same centre

08:39.799 --> 08:44.831
on the backside of your head, and allow
your head to rest on it

08:45.032 --> 08:47.761
and push it back a little bit.

08:47.962 --> 08:52.098
Now here you have to say -

08:53.171 --> 08:57.569
for your satisfaction because you always
feel guilty - that,

08:57.770 --> 09:03.458
“Oh, Divine, if I have done anything wrong,
please forgive me.”

09:10.095 --> 09:12.483
“Please, forgive me.”

09:14.572 --> 09:17.060
From your heart.

09:18.332 --> 09:22.672
Now to the fontanel bone area, where
they say they give baptism,

09:22.873 --> 09:26.530
but actually it’s an artificial one.

09:27.301 --> 09:34.725
Stretch your hand fully and put your centre
of your palm on top

09:34.926 --> 09:42.617
of the fontanel bone area, which was
a very soft bone in your childhood.

09:42.818 --> 09:47.304
Press it hard, press hard your scalp.

09:47.505 --> 09:51.638
Now you have to move it seven times,
saying one thing,

09:51.839 --> 09:57.159
which you have to ask for, “Mother, please,
give us my Self-realization.”

09:57.360 --> 10:01.458
Because I cannot force on you, so you’ve
to ask for it.

10:01.659 --> 10:07.652
Seven times, press it hard and move it
seven times. Very hard.

10:10.234 --> 10:14.351
Slowly. Saying that.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.714
It’s good.

11:05.269 --> 11:08.754
Now, remove the right hand.

11:10.471 --> 11:13.912
Slowly open your eyes.

11:14.597 --> 11:19.164
Put your right hand towards Me and see
on your left-hand.

11:19.365 --> 11:21.545
Raise it a little higher than your head

11:21.746 --> 11:26.867
and see if there’s the cool breeze
is coming out of your head.

11:27.068 --> 11:30.487
Some people might get it. Put the right
hand towards Me please,

11:30.688 --> 11:34.373
right hand towards Me. And with
the left hand -

11:34.574 --> 11:37.709
right hand towards Me - with the left hand.

11:37.910 --> 11:43.593
Just see if there’s a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

11:52.554 --> 11:58.169
Now turn it, put left hand towards Me.
See with your right hand.

12:09.090 --> 12:13.160
Some people might get hot breeze.
It’s alright.

12:13.361 --> 12:17.264
But after some time it will become cool.
