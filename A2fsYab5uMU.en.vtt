00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.407
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:22.367
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:33.174
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:40.488
He lives with bones and things like that.

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.972
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

00:00:45.093 --> 00:00:48.246
what he has, nothing.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.569
So detached, and we should be detached like that.¶

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.770
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.246
extremely loving.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:06.932
How his heart is full of love for others,

00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:09.932
how he looks after others.

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:16.609
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.012
but you should also love each other,

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.133
you should have a loving heart,

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:28.609
and have satisfaction in loving others.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.690
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:38.770
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:44.214
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:48.528
but the depth in shraddha,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.367
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:58.690
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:05.327
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

00:02:05.448 --> 00:02:08.569
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.286
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:15.891
So what do you want now?

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:24.528
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:30.367
He’s so great that he’s detached.

00:02:30.488 --> 00:02:34.286
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:38.690
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:44.528
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:50.133
This detachment you have to develop.¶

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:56.367
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

00:02:56.488 --> 00:03:00.770
of the music, of the rhythm.

00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:05.286
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:09.012
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:17.609
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:27.367
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:30.528
Who keeps this rhythm?

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:36.448
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.932
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

00:03:43.053 --> 00:03:45.327
Who keeps the rhythm?

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:50.407
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:55.174
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:58.528
in everything there is a rhythm.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:05.609
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

00:04:06.327 --> 00:04:09.367
It’s like an ocean.¶

00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:14.690
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:20.174
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

00:04:20.286 --> 00:04:28.811
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:33.569
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:36.851
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:42.093
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:45.327
then Shiva takes charge.

00:04:45.448 --> 00:04:52.811
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

00:04:52.932 --> 00:04:58.174
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:01.649
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.851
They don’t know what these flowers are,

00:05:04.972 --> 00:05:07.811
what time they come up;

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:14.730
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:16.811
– nobody’s bothered.¶

00:05:16.932 --> 00:05:22.053
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:28.569
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:36.569
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.488
And that’s how the nature flourishes

00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:45.367
and comes up and then subsides.¶

00:05:45.488 --> 00:05:48.448
We do not see that point.

00:05:48.528 --> 00:05:52.528
We are just bothered about ourselves.

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:54.972
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

00:05:55.093 --> 00:05:58.649
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.286
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

00:06:03.407 --> 00:06:08.770
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

00:06:08.891 --> 00:06:10.528
“So, what’s the matter?”

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:12.851
“Put the world right Mamma!

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.367
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

00:06:15.488 --> 00:06:21.246
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:27.367
And in that understanding of what one should do

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:31.093
to make this world happy, beautiful,

00:06:31.214 --> 00:06:35.972
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:40.133
and in that working one thinks,

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:46.327
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.811
Isn’t it our job to make

00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:55.053
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:58.214
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

00:06:58.327 --> 00:07:04.811
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

00:07:04.932 --> 00:07:08.407
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:12.133
but you are worried about others,

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:16.133
what’s happening in the world.

00:07:16.214 --> 00:07:22.174
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:26.690
and when it works, it works wonders.¶

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.690
So this is a beautiful evening,

00:07:37.488 --> 00:07:49.053
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

00:07:49.174 --> 00:07:54.569
And I hope you people will understand

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.246
how far you are with that force,

00:07:59.367 --> 00:08:04.448
how much are you drenched in that force,

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:11.093
in that rhythm of Shiva,

00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:16.569
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:21.367
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

00:08:21.488 --> 00:08:27.246
and that way should engulf you completely;

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:32.012
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:36.012
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:37.439
Thank you.¶

00:08:44.448 --> 00:08:52.286
Today we have a Ganesha Puja, a small Ganesha Puja,

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:56.012
then Shiva Puja and then the Devi’s Puja.¶

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:57.488
May God Bless You
