1
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:53,247
Today I am feeling rather sad [that] had to
say something, hard things yesterday and you

2
00:02:53,247 --> 00:03:00,737
know [a] mother is like that (Mother is referring
to a lecture in Marathi the previous day).

3
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:06,026
You have to correct your children, you have
to tell them something, but you don’t like

4
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:12,217
it and you have to really put up yourself
to that point, that you can say something

5
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:14,937
to your children.

6
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:23,676
And the effect was good they said, but I didn’t
want them to cry or weep.

7
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:28,876
I want them to be corrected, to understand
the responsibility that they have.

8
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:39,437
We have to understand that we have a responsibility
towards Sahaja Yoga; and that is, if you understand

9
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:45,547
the first responsibility, is that you have
to be very good Sahaja Yogis to begin with;

10
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,737
that’s the greatest.

11
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:52,237
I have seen some very little girls also are
very show-offs: they’ll be the first to

12
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:58,587
sit further, they’ll be attracting my attention,
doing these things.

13
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:02,527
So they have to be told to behave themselves.

14
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:09,787
There are so many things like that which are
to be told to your children also.

15
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:16,767
Like today so many leaders came and they also
told me what is happening in India now, specially

16
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:26,607
in Maharashtra – but I think it is all over
– that they are taking to Western life,

17
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:32,587
sitting before the mirror, all the time dressing
up, thinking about their beauty, this, that.

18
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:36,457
I mean, it was never done before.

19
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:41,097
And the mothers allow them to do because they
don’t want to face them.

20
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:46,507
And then they see bad pictures and bad films
and things like that, and then they have a

21
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:50,658
bad effect of these bad films and they try
to follow: at the age of sixteen years they

22
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:54,447
want to fall in love or something like that.

23
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:59,527
All this nonsense is coming, I know that this
filmmaking is a very dangerous thing these

24
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:00,527
days.

25
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:05,697
They are making all kinds of films to show
that a sixteen year old girl and an eighteen

26
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:08,307
year old boy run away from the house because
they are ‘in love’.

27
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:12,256
And what do they understand of it?

28
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:17,286
No maturity of any kind to have a good married
life.

29
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:20,486
But for a born-realised children it is different.

30
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,006
They are very different.

31
00:05:23,006 --> 00:05:28,116
Because I have seen the reaction of my own
grandchildren, how they react.

32
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:39,108
So, like one of them said to me, “Can you
imagine grandma that in our gardens, one young

33
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:44,027
man running, another young woman running after
him, dancing in the garden and kissing.

34
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,467
Is it possible?

35
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,337
The stupid things they do in the films!”

36
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:50,217
They make fun of all these things.

37
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:58,917
The youngest one, he came once to Cabella
and there was some film made, of one actress,

38
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,167
‘Mandakini’ or something.

39
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,096
She’s a Muslim lady, but she calls herself
‘Mandakini’.

40
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,107
“Never see her films!” he says, “very
bad, very bad!”

41
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,307
I said, “What happened?”

42
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,107
“Do you know what she did?

43
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:13,527
She went into the River Ganges with very thin
clothes and she came out and she insulted

44
00:06:13,527 --> 00:06:14,527
all of us.

45
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,527
We don’t see her film."

46
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:16,736
I said, “Really?

47
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,577
But must be, I said, the director."

48
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:22,997
“Yes, that horrible Raj Kapoor, he’s the
worst.

49
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:27,747
Thank God he’s dead now."

50
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:28,747
Imagine!

51
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:33,947
Even when they were young their reactions
were like this.

52
00:06:33,947 --> 00:06:37,827
Even I have seen my elder one.

53
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:39,876
She was engaged.

54
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:42,606
She was thinking she’ll select her own.

55
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:49,576
She wanted to marry somebody and she only
stuck onto one fellow to see him, but to the

56
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:53,206
end she was saying, “I don’t want to get
engaged till I see this man thoroughly.

57
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,057
I have not seen him."

58
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:58,066
I mean she never gave in fully.

59
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:01,187
So I was we are never bothered about it.

60
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,357
Whenever they are they behave in such a manner.

61
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,747
Like another one in Delhi I asked her, “Why
do you wear these khadi clothes all the time?

62
00:07:08,747 --> 00:07:10,217
Can’t you wear something better?

63
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:13,597
What will people think, that we don’t give
you any money?”

64
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,977
She said, “No, it’s better.

65
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,157
Nobody looks at you.

66
00:07:16,157 --> 00:07:19,557
It’s a very good idea."

67
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:21,847
So this is a sign of a really born-realised.

68
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:26,087
I have studied all of them, my grandson and
three children.

69
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:27,777
There’s no question.

70
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:31,137
They are so moral, so moral!

71
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:36,387
And we never told them these things.

72
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:40,687
We never told them that, “This is good,”
or, “that good,” or, “you should not

73
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:41,687
do this."

74
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:43,407
They, themselves [understand].

75
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:51,497
Then my sister’s grandson the other day
we met, he’s only a five year old boy, born-realised.

76
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:59,177
So in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat paan, so
my sister, another sister, he calls as all

77
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,967
of us as ‘grandmas’, she ate the paan.

78
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:04,827
He just started fighting, “Why do you eat
paan?

79
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:05,827
Dirty thing.

80
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:06,827
Throw away!

81
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,827
I will have nothing to do.

82
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:08,827
I am kutti with you!”

83
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:09,827
Means I am now finished with it.

84
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,177
Five year old!

85
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:12,177
He protested.

86
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,367
And then he suddenly started crying.

87
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,027
I said, “Why are you crying now?”

88
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,457
“All of them are eating paan.

89
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:17,527
They are all bad people.

90
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,577
I don’t want to have them here!”

91
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:22,257
I mean in the marriage, they were eating paan!

92
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:26,277
So, he said he made everybody throw away their
paan!

93
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:31,947
So I told him, “There are people who don’t
eat paan, don’t take cigarettes and don’t

94
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:34,157
drink and they are with us.

95
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:35,267
They are called Sahaja Yogis."

96
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,427
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!” he said.

97
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:38,967
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!

98
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,557
Well, why do you tolerate, grandma, all these
people?

99
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:42,877
Tell them off!

100
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,527
They have no business to eat paan."

101
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:48,087
I was surprised [at] a five year old child.

102
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:53,887
Maybe, you might say, it’s my relationship
or my blood in them or whatever it is.

103
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:59,587
They are really remarkably moral people, remarkably,
for their age.

104
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:06,207
Also they are moral not only for themselves,
but also their friends and everyone, extremely

105
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:11,627
moral.

106
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:15,847
They don’t like people sitting before the
mirror for hours together, never.

107
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,627
They said, “They must be bhoots."

108
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:21,357
“We had a lady who was working in our house."

109
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:25,777
She said, “She doesn’t clean my bathroom,
she’s just looking at the mirror and looking

110
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:26,777
at herself!”

111
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:29,487
I said, “Isn’t she frightened of herself?”

112
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,247
All kinds of things!

113
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:35,277
They make such fun of all the films, such
films you see.

114
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:41,747
They have seen once there was one film which
my daughters had seen five times, making fun

115
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,907
of the whole thing.

116
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:44,287
You know, they really make fun of all that.

117
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:49,157
So once my husband had to see that film with
other relations in Calcutta.

118
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:50,157
He came back.

119
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,887
He said, “Never see that film again!

120
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,687
Never send those children to that film!”

121
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:57,057
They had already seen it five times!

122
00:09:57,057 --> 00:09:59,957
But such a reaction, you know.

123
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:08,217
They never take to modern ideas [like] answering
back to parents and, “I’ll do what I like!”

124
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:09,217
Why?

125
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:12,567
Why don’t they do it?

126
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:16,267
And to me they are absolutely subservient.

127
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,187
If I am having the bath, they’ll put on
the radio.

128
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:24,577
If I come out, they are sitting there with
a towel and powder for my feet.

129
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:29,267
All the time they are worried about me, why?

130
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:34,797
Not about their parents, so much as they are
worried about me.

131
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:38,957
This is because they are born realised and
the children who are not, these are half-way

132
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:43,167
children, they are like that: they get impressed
by this Western thing and all that.

133
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:47,937
So the parents should see and tell them, “What
is this nonsense?”

134
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:49,817
So many things I can tell you about them.

135
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:55,677
I have been studying them and I was worried
that if these children were not born in my

136
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:57,487
family, what would have happened to them?

137
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:02,947
They don’t like to hear any funny songs
– nothing.

138
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:07,557
Once, early in the morning, my daughter was
playing some ghazals.

139
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:11,947
so she got up and came in the room.

140
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:12,947
She said, “What’s this going on, early
in the morning, crying, crying?

141
00:11:12,947 --> 00:11:13,947
What is this?”

142
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:14,947
So I said, “This is ghazal."

143
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:20,657
“What a puzzle, early in the morning, to
make everyone weep!”

144
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:25,547
You see, these Lucknow people and all those
are very ghazalias: only in the mind.

145
00:11:25,547 --> 00:11:32,357
They never love their wives, never do anything
for them, but they are romantic type.

146
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:36,667
And these girls know about it.

147
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,707
“And we Lucknowas.

148
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:39,787
We don’t want to marry these!

149
00:11:39,787 --> 00:11:45,627
They’re just romancing in their heads and
they don’t love their wives and the wives

150
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,827
also don’t love."

151
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,967
So this is what it is.

152
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,997
I mean, they are so mature.

153
00:11:54,067 --> 00:12:01,597
These two were studying in Patna and they
had only one chappal (sandal) left with them,

154
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,186
which was half broken.

155
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:07,256
So I told, “All right, come along with me
to Delhi.

156
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,116
I’ll buy good chappals for you."

157
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:10,416
I took them there.

158
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,740
They wouldn’t buy another one.

159
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:14,190
“One chappal is only.

160
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,500
One chappal and one chappal."

161
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,180
I said, “Why you have come all the way just
to buy only one chappal?”

162
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,510
“Yes, when this will break we will buy another
one."

163
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,510
And the clothes?

164
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,510
Nothing!

165
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,830
I forced on them their clothes.

166
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,830
They wouldn’t take it.

167
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,830
They said, “No, no, no, no!

168
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,830
There’s no need to spend.

169
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,920
Why do you want to spend?

170
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,230
Already we have got so much loan on our head,
of our parents.

171
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,819
And why do you want to spend more money?”

172
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:40,819
Even grandson.

173
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,130
He said, “My school is so bad!

174
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,530
All the girls want to talk to me."

175
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,300
And now he’s head of the class, school also.

176
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,350
They’re so wise, so sensible.

177
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:57,400
And it’s an example, before you to see that
your children don’t take to stupid things

178
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,430
of so called romance and all that.

179
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,790
They don’t believe in all that.

180
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,400
Today I have to tell you because I have got
reports of some girls who have been misbehaving,

181
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
sitting before the [mirror].

182
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Why?

183
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Why so much?

184
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,860
And I don’t know, I can’t face mirror
for more than for two minutes at the most.

185
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,710
Not because I think I have something wrong
with me, but the vibrations start hitting

186
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,020
me!

187
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,990
I don’t know how I look or what.

188
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,490
Why should you worry so much?

189
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,870
We should be confident, have self-respect.

190
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,970
All is accepted, dirty, filthy, from the West.

191
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,420
And in Sanskrit, as you know I have told you,
they were called as mlecchas.

192
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,150
Mleccha: mala-iccha.

193
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:00,340
They want all dirt and filth, that’s what.

194
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,020
Iccha is the desire; and they take to it.

195
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,360
Even in the Muslim culture that is there,
that’s why in Lucknow and all that, I used

196
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
to get suffocated the way people were romantic.

197
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
No sense of proportion.

198
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,600
But, thank God now, Lucknow has changed so
much.

199
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,879
I am really amazed how these people just looking
at women: every woman they must see, turn

200
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,879
their head at every woman.

201
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:26,920
I mean, their necks might break one day.

202
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,380
But in the West, I have seen, all women look
at the men!

203
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,570
First I didn’t understand what is going
on.

204
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,210
All the time like this, like this, like this.

205
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,960
And then they end up in a lunatic asylum.

206
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,199
What will happen otherwise also?

207
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,249
We are Sahaja Yogis.

208
00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:48,299
We have our own traditions.

209
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:51,069
We are people of very high families.

210
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:53,949
Why should we take to these dirty things?

211
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:59,299
So I would request you to tell your children
not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible

212
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,499
culture that has evolved.

213
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,369
It was not so bad in the West.

214
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,579
I tell you, it was not.

215
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:14,049
It is now ruined; the whole place. They have no idea as to how filthy it has become.

216
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:24,499
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will be
very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature,

217
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:28,968
as well as you will be very moral.

218
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,249
You have to be very [moral].

219
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:36,649
And you should only like people who are moral.

220
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:47,289
This is not to be taught, but to be shown
to the children, how you yourself live.

221
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:56,619
If the mother is all the time busy with her
beauty and this and that, the child also takes

222
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,619
it.

223
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:12,309
All this filth and dirt should not settle
down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.

224
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:17,339
This is what today I wanted to tell you: [about]
these people, really I got worried.

225
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,429
They have no sense of music.

226
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,869
They don’t understand music.

227
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,699
They have no sense of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

228
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:29,199
They are supposed to be your children!

229
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:36,229
Tomorrow the same children will definitely
cleanse the whole world, but what is your

230
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,229
attention is?

231
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,531
You are giving money to them to do what they
like.

232
00:16:40,531 --> 00:16:44,879
You are not putting your any attention.

233
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,049
Parents are there to correct their children.

234
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,679
They have to.

235
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,829
And if they argue, give them two tight slaps
and they will be all right.

236
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,049
In the West, also, the children are horrible,
absolutely horrible children.

237
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,838
They’ll go on asking you questions, “Why?

238
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:01,838
Why?”

239
00:17:01,838 --> 00:17:04,239
Once I was travelling with a child like that
and the mother said, “What to do with this

240
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:05,239
child?”

241
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:07,849
I said, “You ask him: ‘Yesterday what
I answered, do you remember that?

242
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,349
Tell me what I answered you!’

243
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,929
” Since that day he stopped [asking] ‘why’.

244
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,479
Children shouldn’t talk so much.

245
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:18,749
They have no understanding of anything, still
little babies.

246
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:22,158
How are they to talk, as if they are wisdom
personified?

247
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:25,209
This is all Western new method of educating
their children.

248
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,289
“Let them be what they want, they are free.

249
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,289
So what?”

250
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:35,218
With this method, no artist has been produced,
no musician has been produced, no composer

251
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,269
has been produced.

252
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,369
The whole quality has gone down.

253
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:45,949
First you need some discipline in life to
become something.

254
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:51,159
But also it’s very money-oriented in the
West, that if the boy has to clean the car,

255
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,779
you pay him £2.

256
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:57,718
No Sahaja Yogi should do that.

257
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,759
He has to do that.

258
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,349
He sits in the car, so why shouldn’t he
clean it?

259
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:06,158
He should feel, “This is my responsibility."

260
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:13,309
And a very big problem you will face if your
children turn out to be such horrible ones.

261
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:19,079
Of course, I am trying to make a school here
for the Sahaj children, but the parents should

262
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,338
not spoil them.

263
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:23,488
Same with the western people.

264
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:27,218
Now they have got their children, they are
so attached to their children.

265
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:31,008
They think it is their own property, they
can do what they like with them.

266
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,168
We made the school.

267
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:33,628
We paid for the school.

268
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,038
We collected everything, did all that.

269
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,428
They are very nicely coming here to take away
their children to their own countries.

270
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:45,778
They cannot think even that they are Sahaja
Yogis [and] they have to be in Ganapatipule

271
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:46,778
[even] if you are not.

272
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:53,748
They are not going to be like you that, for
some time, take all advantage of Sahaja Yoga

273
00:18:53,748 --> 00:19:01,848
and then just become the same stupid fools.

274
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,828
So they decided to take away their children,
this, that.

275
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,279
I told Yogi, “Why are you sending the children
[home]?”

276
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,658
He said, “The parents are…”

277
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:12,628
Who are the parents?

278
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:16,598
Who are the parents?

279
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:19,078
So this idea should not be there.

280
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:21,797
Children are to be involved in the main stream.

281
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:23,518
They should be in the main stream.

282
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:24,888
They should be here.

283
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,389
Otherwise, we have nothing to do with you
and your children.

284
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:28,389
Get out!

285
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:32,198
Now, I have to take a strong view of the whole
thing.

286
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:36,718
I find, specially in Australia, they are becoming
extremely secluded people.

287
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:42,028
Some of them are having, in the ashram, their
own rooms, their own television, their own

288
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:43,538
this thing, their own cooking.

289
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:45,118
This own business has to go away.

290
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:49,238
Throw away all such people from the ashrams.

291
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,838
I am surprised at Australians!

292
00:19:51,838 --> 00:20:01,158
They got out of the jail and again want to
go into the same jail.

293
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:08,178
Next time all the children have to come to
Ganapatipule; next time, and nobody has to

294
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,015
[say], “We have booked their seats.

295
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:11,485
We have done that."

296
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:13,435
I told them, “Put them into trouble.

297
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:14,835
Tell them we can’t send the children.

298
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:21,690
Let them pay for that then they will understand."

299
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:29,657
Now the last, and not the least, is the way
still we are attached to money.

300
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,907
Sahaja Yoga is free, agreed.

301
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,847
Your Realisation is free.

302
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:45,647
But this time, can you believe, [on] the sixteenth
of November, I telephoned from Russia to find

303
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:48,805
out how much money was collected and there
was very little money there.

304
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:53,995
And such a big programme, such a difficult
programme and such an expensive programme

305
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,394
we had done.

306
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:58,264
At the right time they let me down!

307
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:00,505
So I had to borrow money to have this programme.

308
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:01,505
Can you believe it?

309
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:10,445
They don’t feel responsible that they’re
troubling Mother like this!

310
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:13,855
I was not sure how many are coming, how many
are not coming.

311
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,645
First they said only two hundred coming, then
three hundred are coming, then I heard there

312
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,545
were six hundred!

313
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:33,435
Have you got a big bank account here that
you can just do what you like?

314
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:36,245
So they are not responsible.

315
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:47,565
Next time if you do not pay money till the
end of October, you are out of the tour!

316
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:49,644
Anywhere!

317
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:56,425
I cannot go on borrowing money like this every
time.

318
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:59,855
And then I have to return that money to my
husband.

319
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:05,135
It’s a fact!

320
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:08,655
Everybody knows.

321
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:18,735
[In] money matters, also, we have not yet
been able to be real Sahaja Yogis.

322
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:25,205
Now, this Shyamji, has bought these saris
on a little concession and he thought that

323
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,585
he will sell those and whatever concession
he gets it, he will give to Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:22:28,585 --> 00:22:32,765
He’s a very honest man.

325
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:38,855
But because some saris were a little less
in price they were not [sold by] Sahaj Yogis,

326
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:43,665
nothing, and they were artificial saris, people
went and bought saris from him.

327
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:46,055
And none of them bought saris from Shyamji.

328
00:22:46,055 --> 00:22:52,195
They are very vain type.

329
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:56,825
Whatever is the little profit that he will
have, he gives it to me.

330
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:59,144
We have so much extra expenses.

331
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:05,245
You have no idea!

332
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:06,255
Same about presents.

333
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:10,805
The money, you people, you gave me about the
presents, also, is so delayed.

334
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:19,805
Just now we have taken thirty-five thousand
pounds, extra, for the musicians, which is

335
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:21,215
not yet paid back.

336
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:26,565
Here are [the] people, you can ask them, they
are dealing in the bank.

337
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:30,825
I have paid for this Chindwada house, four
lakhs of rupees already, not a single pie

338
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:33,894
(1/192 rupee) has been given so far, paid
for.

339
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:37,975
We have to do so many things.

340
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:39,865
But so many Sahaja Yogis there are.

341
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,535
I tell them all, “Don’t give me any presents.

342
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:44,235
I don’t want any presents from you."

343
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:47,235
But you must pay for all these expenses which
are incurred.

344
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:52,885
Today is the first day I am talking about
it, because this time you really put me out

345
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:57,475
completely.

346
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:01,775
Absolutely, I was.

347
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:04,285
I didn’t know what will I do.

348
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:06,744
I never borrow money.

349
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:14,647
Partly I got from Italy and partly I borrowed:
Partly, quite a lot.

350
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:17,817
After all, everything needs money, you must
understand.

351
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:24,297
So, you see, next time if you do all these
things I’ll cancel the tours.

352
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:32,597
Please, by the end of October, remember all
your money should be there.

353
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:40,187
It’s not proper to say all these things
to you, I know, but you should also know what

354
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,287
trouble I am going through.

355
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:43,287
For doing what?

356
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,717
For your Realisation, for your tours, for
your everything.

357
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:52,997
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga do I?

358
00:24:57,846 --> 00:25:08,523
Also, the last thing is this, as I have said,
money is needed just now, but maybe, might

359
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:14,672
be, something might [be] worked out when you
won’t need so much money; may.

360
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:23,787
It will only work out if you people are sincere.

361
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:26,346
So many things [missing part]

362
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:29,706
 working out, I agree, but still

363
00:25:29,806 --> 00:25:38,946
these are things that are missing which must
be somehow or other corrected: by the leaders,

364
00:25:38,946 --> 00:25:43,436
by the world leaders, and coordinated.

365
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:45,656
It should be done.

366
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:48,125
After all, you know my age now.

367
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,976
You don’t want to trouble me.

368
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:58,135
This is the only kindness I need: not to go
on postponing things, not to go on being irresponsible,

369
00:25:58,135 --> 00:25:59,646
that’s all!

370
00:25:59,646 --> 00:26:04,125
I have been telling you for the last fifteen
years [that] I don’t want any presents!

371
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,546
For presents, for saris, everybody’s anxious.

372
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:13,036
Now this time every country wanted to give
me [a] sari.

373
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:14,255
Just imagine!

374
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,696
I don’t need that.

375
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:22,186
I don’t know what I will do with it.

376
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:29,266
But full attention to yourself and to the
collective work and to the global work.

377
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:36,656
If I stop this work, it’s very easy, but
you don’t want that.

378
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:39,466
Even few are coming, whatever it is.

379
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,006
Definitely you tell me [that] so many are
coming – finished!

380
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:46,986
It’s hardly two, three years more, at the
most it will continue.

381
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:50,375
It cannot go on forever.

382
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:57,176
We’ll have to think of something else.

383
00:26:57,176 --> 00:27:06,096
And my own style is that, whatever you give
for my pujas, I keep it for Sahaja Yoga only:

384
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:11,516
for the buying of silver, this, that.

385
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:15,656
So much of silver I have given, so much gold
that is here is my own.

386
00:27:15,656 --> 00:27:17,926
Everything, most of the ornaments are my own.

387
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:22,546
Now what else I should do?

388
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:29,446
Not that I want anything from you, but you
should be responsible and understand.

389
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,286
All of you should, please.

390
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:36,096
If you can really think that this is so important.

391
00:27:36,096 --> 00:27:41,296
Twelve disciples of Christ worked out Christianity
– only twelve.

392
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:47,836
And they were fishermen: how they did it!

393
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:56,076
All right, so everybody is telling me that,
“Mother you must talk to them and tell them

394
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:58,175
about it."

395
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:00,594
So I have told you.

396
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,803
I have done my job.

397
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:08,994
Now it is for you to think what is good and
what should be done.

398
00:28:08,994 --> 00:28:15,254
Sahaja Yoga is your own: is for your children,
is for your family, is for the country, not

399
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:17,444
only [that, but] for the whole world, where
you live.

400
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,964
You are such a great people who are realised-souls.

401
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:24,844
Where are the realised-souls here?

402
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:30,694
So have self-esteem, then you will feel responsible,
you know, “I am responsible."

403
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:34,233
Thank you very much.

404
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:37,243
May God bless you.
