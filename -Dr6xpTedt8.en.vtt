00:04.492 --> 00:09.302
Shri Jesus Christ Puja. Bogota (Colombia), 26 June 1989.

00:34.987 --> 00:38.638
Somebody has to translated.

01:02.799 --> 01:08.386
Today I would like to tell you about Christ and Christianity

01:08.411 --> 01:10.616
because that’s very important,

01:10.684 --> 01:15.175
because this country is very Catholic

01:15.713 --> 01:20.792
and even if you are Protestants or Catholics,

01:22.315 --> 01:27.565
the church has not fulfilled

01:28.716 --> 01:30.914
what Christ wanted them to do,

01:30.939 --> 01:33.536
which you can see very clearly.

01:54.311 --> 02:01.604
If you read Bible you’ll find that

02:03.844 --> 02:09.477
Christ has been described as the son of Mother Mary,

02:10.372 --> 02:13.411
born out of immaculate conception.

02:22.854 --> 02:30.489
But we have not been able to really profoundly accept that.

02:38.386 --> 02:43.187
This superficial way they are using Christ

02:43.267 --> 02:48.044
to make money, make properties, build churches.

02:58.006 --> 03:01.513
And because they can not explain anything,

03:01.688 --> 03:04.616
they always say that it is a mystery.

03:09.036 --> 03:12.932
That Christ was born of an immaculate Mother,

03:13.012 --> 03:16.454
‘Inmaculata,’ with immaculate conception,

03:16.486 --> 03:18.753
according to them it is a mystery.

03:24.744 --> 03:36.678
Also they can not explain how Christ walked on the water.

03:42.102 --> 03:46.617
Because they have not been able to find out the spiritual life

03:46.895 --> 03:49.800
which was the idea of Christ.

03:54.299 --> 03:57.044
And they created such materialistic world.

04:00.612 --> 04:05.135
Moreover, the amount of money and wealth

04:05.191 --> 04:09.070
Vatican has, one can’t understand

04:09.126 --> 04:13.347
how there is so much poverty in the Catholic nations.

04:21.376 --> 04:27.244
They have not tried to solve the problem of poverty at all.

04:33.913 --> 04:39.096
In India they converted people by giving them some

04:39.882 --> 04:41.810
loaf of bread or something like that

04:41.906 --> 04:45.315
and very low level people who were just,

04:45.347 --> 04:48.450
we can say primitive, they converted.

04:55.571 --> 04:59.987
Whether they are Protestants or they are Catholics,

05:00.879 --> 05:04.934
they are the two sides of one coin.

05:10.771 --> 05:18.711
Because they are seeking something that is very transitory,

05:22.356 --> 05:26.062
they are not seeking the Eternal Life.

05:29.062 --> 05:37.726
And the people are extremely frozen,
meticulous and rigid.

05:42.537 --> 05:46.671
They only know how to make money, that’s all.

05:49.614 --> 05:56.244
And even the very, very higher people
there have relations with mafia.

06:02.396 --> 06:09.153
So it is something like a religious Mafia,
you can call it.

06:12.818 --> 06:19.426
Also their concept about sex
and married life is extremely funny.

06:25.768 --> 06:33.816
By living an unnatural life,
they have suppressed people so much that

06:33.889 --> 06:40.243
wherever Catholicism has gone,
people have become extremely licentious.

06:50.711 --> 06:54.329
They have no sense of chastity.

06:59.515 --> 07:05.927
Apart from that, what Christ has said
that you have to seek yourself.

07:11.421 --> 07:16.288
The way He has described about a person who is a Christian,

07:16.401 --> 07:19.463
‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.’

07:24.274 --> 07:27.650
Also in the Bible it is: ‘Thou shalt not kill.’

07:31.568 --> 07:36.621
the amount of killing that is done by Christian people,

07:37.748 --> 07:43.143
their sins, God knows how they are going to pay for it.

07:43.207 --> 07:48.677
Through cocaine maybe, I don’t know how.
They have killed so many people.

07:59.357 --> 08:03.388
If they had the white skin they felt
that  they had a right

08:03.547 --> 08:06.214
to kill all others with other skins,

08:11.532 --> 08:15.034
while Christ was not a white skin man at all.

08:17.871 --> 08:20.577
He was brown like us.

08:24.959 --> 08:28.413
He was not born in England or Switzerland.

08:31.451 --> 08:35.307
So to think that if you have a white skin

08:35.387 --> 08:42.196
you have a right to finish everybody is something
like a Hitler’s situation.

08:48.396 --> 08:53.721
But worse than that it is,
because it is in the name of God. Because that

08:57.826 --> 09:01.325
in the name of God you can not do such things,

09:01.646 --> 09:03.709
these are the worst type.

09:10.412 --> 09:17.154
So this is the outside,
but the inside of it is also extremely poor

09:17.345 --> 09:22.896
and extremely detrimental to the growth, spiritual growth.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.656
They don’t know who is Holy Ghost.

09:35.730 --> 09:40.243
They do not want to believe that Christ’s Mother was a Goddess.

09:47.284 --> 09:53.149
In the Hebrew language it was written that She would be a …

09:54.878 --> 09:59.833
She would be a  punya  means a virgin.

10:06.587 --> 10:11.005
Now there is a proper understanding
that She was a virgin,

10:11.013 --> 10:13.885
and then She had a child.

10:18.706 --> 10:22.642
But they have no sense of virginity left.

10:28.721 --> 10:34.427
Now apart from that, Christ has said that
you should seek the truth,

10:34.618 --> 10:37.975
you should seek the Spirit,

10:38.915 --> 10:40.922
they have never bothered about it.

10:49.298 --> 10:53.718
But the main thing that Christ has said, that

10:54.099 --> 10:56.908
that ‘I will send you the Holy Ghost

11:02.190 --> 11:07.832
Who will comfort you, Who will counsel you

11:07.864 --> 11:10.026
and Who will redeem you.’

11:19.212 --> 11:21.537
So, they never looked for One

11:24.537 --> 11:27.521
because they don’t know who is Holy Ghost.

11:29.856 --> 11:34.061
And in the Catholic religion now, even till today,

11:34.191 --> 11:37.663
they do not allow women to be ordained

11:43.529 --> 11:50.780
when Adi Shakti,  which is a feminine aspect of God,

11:50.892 --> 11:53.121
created the whole world!

11:58.382 --> 12:01.707
that’s why the women also, in the West,

12:02.071 --> 12:07.316
have tried to compete with men,
because they have no position in the religious life.

12:14.457 --> 12:19.773
So when the women have no position,
they started competing with men

12:19.853 --> 12:25.806
and they lost their femininity also
and they became very dominating, right-sided.

12:36.148 --> 12:40.711
So what they have been preaching that there should be no divorce,

12:40.743 --> 12:44.187
they made all arrangements that
people should divorce each other.

12:57.736 --> 13:03.267
Now, to understand Christianity,
we have to know through our Sahaja Yoga

13:03.509 --> 13:06.376
that Christ resides in the Agnya Chakra.

13:12.045 --> 13:15.735
And when the Kundalini comes to the Agnya Chakra,

13:15.862 --> 13:18.329
you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

13:18.441 --> 13:20.962
otherwise the Kundalini does not rise.

13:29.639 --> 13:34.520
So once you say the Lord’s Prayer,
Christ is awakened in your Agnya Chakra.

13:40.843 --> 13:45.287
Whenever I travel in the western countries, even here,

13:45.328 --> 13:52.099
My Agnya gets so badly caught up,
and the left Vishuddhi, in a Catholic area…

13:58.935 --> 14:00.043
and Agnya!

14:02.893 --> 14:07.872
That means people are against Christ
and they are feeling guilty,

14:07.920 --> 14:12.734
because all the time the Catholic church
is telling them  that you should feel guilty

14:20.146 --> 14:23.043
and then confess to the priest.

14:27.486 --> 14:31.670
Now the priests are not realized souls,

14:34.961 --> 14:36.501
not the Pope is.

14:38.583 --> 14:46.763
So it is absolutely so artificial,
the baptism itself is so artificial.

14:52.405 --> 14:59.111
Also Christ said that this is the bread,  He said, is My Body

14:59.238 --> 15:03.479
and this Blood is My wine.

15:03.870 --> 15:08.210
He should have said water,  would have been better
for these stupid people, would have been much better.

15:18.615 --> 15:25.554
But even now, if you look that country, you find people
don’t drink water, they drink only grape juice.

15:32.183 --> 15:34.658
So wine doesn’t mean alcohol.

15:37.989 --> 15:45.976
Also they say that Christ made some wine
for the people who had come for the wedding.

15:52.961 --> 15:56.480
The first part of it, that Christ went to the wedding,

15:56.497 --> 16:01.650
itself shows that He respected the custom of wedding.

16:08.451 --> 16:14.355
The second thing is that wine can not be
made alcohol into a second.

16:22.305 --> 16:25.447
The alcohol has to rot,

16:27.851 --> 16:33.679
to become to be... I mean, wine has to
rot to become alcohol inner.

16:40.160 --> 16:46.777
I went to Italy, and there was one gentleman
called Romano Battalia,

16:47.000 --> 16:52.139
who was to interview Me for his TV program.

17:00.674 --> 17:04.610
So he said, ‘First You give me realization, then I’ll do the TV.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.864
So I said, ‘All right, get some water.’

17:18.111 --> 17:22.259
and just I put my fingers into it and I said now drink it,

17:22.958 --> 17:26.360
so he said, ‘This is wine! this is not water.’

17:33.485 --> 17:37.149
I said ‘How?’
He said, ‘It tastes like grape juice.’

17:41.118 --> 17:45.879
the person who brought, he asked it,
‘Did you bring water or juice?’  He said, ‘I brought water.’

17:52.452 --> 17:59.352
so this is also another thing they have used to take alcohol.

18:06.735 --> 18:12.639
They do not understand any subtlety about religion,

18:12.711 --> 18:16.623
about dead bodies, how to deal with them.

18:25.010 --> 18:33.126
Unfortunately or fortunately I lived
very near a church in London.

18:38.657 --> 18:43.537
And the whole day — it was on the back
side of the church, or the side of the church —

18:43.633 --> 18:48.242
the whole day one activity was going on: barrels of beers

18:48.267 --> 18:52.148
were brought in, emptied and sent, the whole day.

18:58.324 --> 19:05.909
And I could not understand how they would be
drinking such a lot of barrels, big, big barrels.

19:10.773 --> 19:15.772
And in the night, if I could ever see,
I would see lots of

19:15.797 --> 19:19.978
spirits coming out of,  horrible black spirits
coming out of the church.

19:24.965 --> 19:29.282
I gave them bandhans and I said, ‘You take your birth.’

19:33.143 --> 19:34.809
But they didn’t want it.

19:35.998 --> 19:40.286
They were mostly bishops, and all sort of people perhaps,

19:40.485 --> 19:42.503
who were buried in that church.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.713
So one day I went to that church

19:52.102 --> 19:54.530
and as soon as I stepped in,

19:54.811 --> 19:59.299
I felt I’ll faint here, because everywhere

19:59.340 --> 20:03.723
there were ten dead bodies, one after another,  buried

20:03.748 --> 20:06.852
in that church, throughout, it was like a churchyard.

20:15.817 --> 20:19.795
That means they have no idea as to where to bury the dead.

20:19.828 --> 20:23.486
In India, even in the churches they will never allow

20:23.510 --> 20:27.248
any dead body to be buried and to walk on them like that.

20:37.620 --> 20:45.623
So in every way they have not gone deep into
themselves spiritually to find out what is the truth;

20:45.708 --> 20:49.621
even they have not been looking out for the Holy Spirit.

20:58.284 --> 21:01.484
So when they say that we are the chosen ones,

21:01.508 --> 21:03.698
and that once we become Christians,

21:03.746 --> 21:07.330
God is going to give us the heavens,  that’s sadly mistaken.

21:13.741 --> 21:17.788
Because whether you are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

21:17.860 --> 21:23.285
you can commit any sin, everybody is capable,

21:23.365 --> 21:26.539
in every religion; no religion binds them.

21:35.562 --> 21:39.764
Only in Sahaja Yoga you become righteous and sinless –

21:45.527 --> 21:47.993
that you give up all your habits,

21:50.939 --> 21:54.134
and also you get rid of your tempers

21:56.262 --> 21:59.560
and your meticulousness,  your frozen nature.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.696
You trust each other, you open your heart.

22:11.059 --> 22:13.569
And you forget about racialism,

22:13.594 --> 22:17.442
about your countries,
and you try to become one with each other.

22:23.034 --> 22:26.470
And when our children will grow up,

22:26.637 --> 22:29.492
we’ll find one collective body,

22:29.548 --> 22:35.476
absolutely forgotten all this nonsensical barriers
between one person and another.

22:41.891 --> 22:44.139
But when you meet a fanatic,

22:44.211 --> 22:48.435
you see, don’t argue with him.

22:53.550 --> 22:56.989
Their brain is covered with fanaticism,
they can not understand.

23:01.603 --> 23:05.029
But any open-minded person, if he asks you anything,

23:05.102 --> 23:08.611
then gradually, one by one, intelligently,

23:08.682 --> 23:12.390
you have to talk in a very sweet manner:
‘See, I was a Christian,

23:12.415 --> 23:16.118
and I could not find it,
and my mind was going on one side,

23:16.158 --> 23:21.194
I was not integrated.’ all these things
you should talk, as if it happened to you.

23:38.664 --> 23:45.029
So then what happens, that
they would start seeing the point and the truth,

23:45.211 --> 23:51.058
that it’s not that you give up Christ,
but we give up the so-called Christianity.

24:01.684 --> 24:06.861
And this way we can get all those half-hearted people

24:06.948 --> 24:10.583
who are neither there nor into anything else,

24:10.635 --> 24:12.905
they will definitively come to Sahaja Yoga.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.561
And there is nothing to feel guilty.

24:27.886 --> 24:32.322
It’s all done by every religion,
they tell you,  ‘You are a sinner.’

24:32.742 --> 24:36.683
Everybody says they can because then they can catch on it.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.433
It’s all Brahma Chaitanya,

24:46.230 --> 24:53.195
which itself in itself creates and sees its own play

25:00.142 --> 25:01.848
and enjoys it sees them.

25:07.101 --> 25:11.198
An analogy can be given like the sea creates the waves

25:11.294 --> 25:13.931
and then sees the waves and enjoys them.

25:20.263 --> 25:25.072
So when we are ignorant, with our ego covered,

25:25.168 --> 25:28.159
every wave thinks that, ‘I’m something great!’.

25:36.840 --> 25:41.260
But when they dissolve in the sea, you can feel it.

25:44.749 --> 25:50.769
The vibrations are called spurthi
in Sanskrit language, spurthi.

25:54.565 --> 26:03.786
And that is turana that vibrations we can call it that pulsation

26:03.967 --> 26:08.109
is what you call as Brahma Chaitanya.

26:17.363 --> 26:23.731
So we have to become one with that
and allow it to work it out for us, everything.

26:33.753 --> 26:38.009
So supposing something fails —
if you work out something, something fails –

26:38.057 --> 26:41.160
so we should know it’s working something for our good.

26:47.977 --> 26:53.875
So you never will be frustrated
and you will see the play of Brahma Chaitanya.

27:00.877 --> 27:02.210
May God bless you.
