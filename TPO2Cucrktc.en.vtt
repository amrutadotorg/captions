00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.715
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.138
It's a very opportune time today, I feel,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.681
where the innocence, especially

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:29.514
in the European and American countries,

00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:32.553
is under attack.

00:00:34.214 --> 00:00:37.132
There's no respect of the innocence,

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.798
no value for the innocence.

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:45.923
They don't understand how important

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.298
it is for human life

00:00:51.132 --> 00:00:54.756
to have innocence

00:00:55.756 --> 00:01:01.173
being respected within themselves and also without.

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:08.007
The human life is different from that of animal life.

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:13.298
Animals are controlled all the time, or we can say

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:18.590
they are under a complete imprisonment, you can say

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:24.590
under the will of Lord Sadashiva.

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.464
That's why He's called as Pashupati.

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:35.423
But human beings have been given freedom

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:40.840
to choose their ascent, to choose the right,

00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:43.298
to choose the truth.

00:01:43.506 --> 00:01:47.548
Only through innocence they can achieve that.

00:01:48.423 --> 00:01:50.696
Can you remove this one from here because

00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:53.439
people can't see Me I think.

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:04.339
It's all right.

00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:13.132
Only the innocence is the source of joy.

00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:18.756
Without innocence you cannot enjoy anything fully.

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:25.673
This innocence is today completely under challenge

00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:29.965
and to finish the innocence,

00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:32.882
in a very subtle way

00:02:33.423 --> 00:02:36.673
there are very negative, cruel,

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:40.673
criminal type of people who are working it out.

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:45.132
Their minds, if you say “possessed,” it doesn't look like that

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:50.631
because otherwise they are quite intelligent.

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:55.339
They are also, in a way,

00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:59.381
creative of horrible things.

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.256
So you can't say they are not intelligent,

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:08.882
but from where do they get this knowledge

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:12.464
of creating something so horrifying?

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:22.715
In this Kali Yuga, as in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.882
everybody can take birth. There's freedom.

00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.882
It was not before so much so

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.423
that all kinds of evil people have taken

00:03:38.464 --> 00:03:40.548
birth on this earth.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.715
These evil people generate

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:51.965
evil thoughts and people catch them and get moving with it.

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.673
Even a good person can get swayed by it.

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:59.173
Even a saint can get swayed by it.

00:04:00.048 --> 00:04:03.923
So these forces of evil,

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:08.965
the forces which are working out today,

00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:13.132
are coming basically from these horrible people.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:17.882
Firstly, they might have come as false gurus,

00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:22.798
teaching something nonsensical,

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:25.256
like Rajneesh.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:29.381
Then from some philosophers like Freud,

00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:34.548
who is still accepted in some countries as a great philosopher,

00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:42.798
and still some psychologists worship him as God.

00:04:44.132 --> 00:04:49.048
This Freudian knowledge was accepted

00:04:49.548 --> 00:04:53.506
without even thinking why Freud did that.

00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:58.007
Freud was a Jew,

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:03.715
and he found that many Christians tortured the Jews in America.

00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:08.090
This is another anti Christ activity.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.298
And when they tortured the Jews,

00:05:11.798 --> 00:05:16.048
this fellow thought that better to make them immoral,

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:18.173
destroy their innocence.

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:21.173
I don't know if he could understand to that point,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.840
and he started theories which were so shocking

00:05:28.048 --> 00:05:33.132
that normally any sensible person would never have accepted it.

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:38.631
But so many people accepted in America to begin with.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.423
In America,

00:05:41.631 --> 00:05:44.132
people take to anything very easily which is absurd,

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:46.132
which is stupid; I don't know why.

00:05:46.298 --> 00:05:48.840
They have a special liking for such things.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.756
If Freud had come to India,

00:05:50.965 --> 00:05:53.935
they would have cut him into a hundred pieces, I tell you,

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:56.097
and thrown in the Arabic Sea.

00:05:56.298 --> 00:05:58.464
They could not have born this idea,

00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:03.464
the way he had insulted the mother and her love for her child,

00:06:03.673 --> 00:06:05.923
the purity of her love.

00:06:08.298 --> 00:06:11.464
But Jews did not accept him, surprisingly.

00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:13.423
Jews did not accept.

00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:18.840
It's the Christians who accepted his ideas and started destroying,

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:21.923
displeasing Shri Ganesh.

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:26.173
First of all,

00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:29.965
we have to understand we are born in a very precarious,

00:06:30.132 --> 00:06:32.548
dangerous times.

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:36.631
At the time of Christ there were very few people

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.764
who followed him and they didn't understand much about Kundalini either.

00:06:40.965 --> 00:06:42.923
They had no knowledge.

00:06:43.464 --> 00:06:45.756
They had no knowledge that Christ

00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:48.590
was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.090
But in the Christian countries only you find

00:06:52.256 --> 00:06:55.673
the insult of Christ, the insult of innocence

00:06:56.007 --> 00:07:00.090
openly done, sometimes legally accepted.

00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:05.132
So when we are born under such horrible circumstances,

00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:07.506
we have to build up

00:07:07.715 --> 00:07:10.464
a great force, ourselves,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.631
of spirituality.

00:07:13.882 --> 00:07:15.798
When I came today,

00:07:16.048 --> 00:07:19.673
there was no breeze, no leaf was moving,

00:07:19.882 --> 00:07:23.506
but you were singing songs and tremendous breeze was coming

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:26.798
from you all, and that made Me understand

00:07:27.007 --> 00:07:30.882
that this Divine force has come into being.

00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:33.548
It is there.

00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:38.840
It's working. Not only that, but it’s very powerful.

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:44.132
Normally, breeze doesn't come to Me, it goes the other way around.

00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.007
But it was such a tremendous breeze

00:07:47.214 --> 00:07:49.548
that I had to hold somebody's hand.

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:52.590
And not a leaf was moving.

00:07:54.132 --> 00:07:56.756
So this collective force that you have,

00:07:57.007 --> 00:07:59.298
you must remember you have to fight it,

00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:03.298
not to run away. Don't escape it.

00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:06.548
You have to fight it

00:08:06.756 --> 00:08:10.840
and you have to prove that innocence is to be respected.

00:08:20.506 --> 00:08:25.381
Adi Shakti first made Shri Ganesh.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:28.339
It was the first

00:08:28.756 --> 00:08:31.339
deity was created. Why?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.256
Because She wanted to fill

00:08:35.464 --> 00:08:39.798
the whole atmosphere with Chaitanya,

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.214
with holiness, with auspiciousness.

00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:46.715
It is still there.

00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:49.464
It's still everywhere you can feel

00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:53.548
Chaitanya is working, but

00:08:54.673 --> 00:08:58.339
it does not penetrate into the

00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:03.048
modern minds because modern mind

00:09:03.214 --> 00:09:06.339
doesn't know what this innocence is.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.590
They have no idea at all about innocence.

00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:14.590
The way they are going on

00:09:14.882 --> 00:09:20.339
everywhere, is really something never happened on this earth.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.756
So with the innocence comes moral life.

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:34.423
Morality is the expression of innocence.

00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:43.339
Innocence

00:09:43.923 --> 00:09:49.464
shows a person that he's incapable of being immoral.

00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:52.548
Once I had gone to visit a ship.

00:09:52.923 --> 00:09:55.994
I was coming out in the Customs.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.236
When I was coming in the Customs

00:09:58.437 --> 00:10:00.814
they said, "Did you get anything from the ship?"

00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:02.514
I said, "Yes, of course."

00:10:02.715 --> 00:10:05.423
So they were shocked, you know , "What did you get?"

00:10:05.673 --> 00:10:07.214
"Some cheese."

00:10:07.464 --> 00:10:08.590
"And?"

00:10:08.798 --> 00:10:12.840
"And we ate also, and we have some cheese with us.”

00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:14.298
"What else?"

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:16.256
"Some books."

00:10:16.464 --> 00:10:18.256
"Books?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.090
You are not supposed to get any books from there."

00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:22.756
I said, "Why not?"

00:10:22.965 --> 00:10:25.173
He said, “You have to pay Customs."

00:10:25.631 --> 00:10:30.214
I said, “All right, how much do we have to pay Customs?"

00:10:30.548 --> 00:10:33.673
“You didn't read any rule about it?”  I said, “No.”

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.214
I was innocent.  I never read anything

00:10:36.423 --> 00:10:39.381
that you have to pay money for books also.

00:10:40.007 --> 00:10:42.756
He said, “No, no you are joking. Go."

00:10:43.464 --> 00:10:45.631
They thought this woman is so simple,

00:10:45.923 --> 00:10:49.860
She doesn't, I was the wife of the Chairman of Shipping Corporation,

00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:51.519
going in a very big car,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.387
and they couldn't understand this woman is so simple that

00:10:54.588 --> 00:10:56.713
She's saying She has taken some cheese

00:10:56.914 --> 00:10:59.331
and She has taken some books.

00:11:01.631 --> 00:11:04.506
All these laws and regulations

00:11:04.756 --> 00:11:07.381
people bind they have also come

00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:11.132
from our idea of Dharma.

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:15.339
But the root of Dharma is innocence.

00:11:16.756 --> 00:11:20.007
All laws are made

00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:23.423
to protect the innocent.

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:26.548
Not to punish

00:11:27.132 --> 00:11:31.173
only the criminals but to protect the innocent person.

00:11:31.715 --> 00:11:35.132
So if somebody is proved to be innocent,

00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:40.132
your innocence protects you.

00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:43.506
I have seen many a times in My life,

00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:47.965
because I'm so simple, I should say,

00:11:48.506 --> 00:11:53.007
that I had no problem, never, of anything.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:12:00.048
This is a kind of

00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:02.882
a very powerful vibrations

00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:05.673
that come from an innocent person,

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.214
like from small children.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.339
Small children, if you see their vibrations,

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:16.339
hundreds grown up Sahaja Yogis may not have

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.756
the vibrations of a little one, I can tell you this much.

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:22.673
But once they start growing,

00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:27.381
then they become very intelligent,

00:12:28.298 --> 00:12:31.090
very grown up, matured,

00:12:31.923 --> 00:12:36.965
and as if they have lost their innocence.

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:41.173
This is no growth according to Me.

00:12:41.715 --> 00:12:45.506
According to Me this is the death of innocence.

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:49.007
To be cunning, to be clever,

00:12:49.423 --> 00:12:53.381
to be very intelligent, so called,

00:12:54.132 --> 00:12:56.756
it is very self-deceptive.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.173
For that, there is one blessing also.

00:13:06.423 --> 00:13:09.464
All those who have

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.882
committed such mistakes

00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:17.631
have to ask forgiveness from Sadashiva

00:13:17.965 --> 00:13:20.673
or from the Adi Shakti.

00:13:21.965 --> 00:13:24.423
But Ganesha doesn't forgive.

00:13:25.798 --> 00:13:29.381
That is one thing wrong with Him: He doesn't forgive.

00:13:30.256 --> 00:13:34.007
If you have hurt Him, He'll hit you back.

00:13:34.882 --> 00:13:38.381
As a result now, we have diseases like AIDS,

00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:40.923
all other horrible diseases that you have

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:43.965
which are called as secret diseases.

00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:48.381
They are all because of the wrath of Shri Ganesh.

00:13:48.923 --> 00:13:51.673
Immoral life that people have been leading

00:13:51.923 --> 00:13:54.173
as if they have a permission

00:13:54.548 --> 00:13:57.381
from God Almighty to do what they like.

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:03.048
People are so proud, such vanity,

00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:07.173
that they think whatever they do, after all, what,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.840
nothing can happen to them.

00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:13.214
And with all these things happening in this world,

00:14:13.464 --> 00:14:16.590
people are still taking to immorality,

00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:19.132
very openly,

00:14:20.214 --> 00:14:22.298
boastfully.

00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:27.256
And I've seen that people who are elite, I have till now,

00:14:27.506 --> 00:14:29.298
been in the elite people.

00:14:29.548 --> 00:14:33.715
They crack such dirty jokes and they are so

00:14:33.965 --> 00:14:37.423
overly smart that you just can't bear their company.

00:14:37.923 --> 00:14:41.132
They are worse than the loafers on the street sometimes.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:44.132
So this disease has spread,

00:14:44.631 --> 00:14:50.214
spread among older people more than among younger people,

00:14:51.506 --> 00:14:53.007
among children.

00:14:53.173 --> 00:14:58.464
So I think the people are now jealous of the little children.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.506
Otherwise, why should they attack

00:15:00.715 --> 00:15:03.756
younger children? What do they get out of them?

00:15:05.882 --> 00:15:08.840
In this jealous attitude

00:15:09.048 --> 00:15:12.923
they try to attack in a very dirty, funny manner.

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:16.423
Then Shri Ganesh,

00:15:16.631 --> 00:15:18.673
He will never forgive these people -

00:15:18.882 --> 00:15:21.381
never, never, never.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.756
First of all, He'll expose them,

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:28.506
and He will punish them for seven lives.

00:15:28.923 --> 00:15:32.715
Seven lives their families will be cursed,

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:36.798
and seven lives they, themselves, will be cursed.

00:15:37.048 --> 00:15:39.923
That is His commandment.

00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:42.756
But if His Mother says, "All right, forgive",

00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:46.173
or the father says, "All right, forgive", He obeys.

00:15:46.423 --> 00:15:50.048
He obeys His Mother absolutely.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.214
Never questions, never questions,

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.631
never answers back.

00:15:59.673 --> 00:16:03.007
Whatever He’s told,

00:16:03.423 --> 00:16:08.132
though He's in command of all the Ganas, He's  Ganadheesha,

00:16:08.464 --> 00:16:13.631
but before His Mother, He's just like a little baby.

00:16:14.339 --> 00:16:17.256
He doesn't challenge the Mother.

00:16:17.464 --> 00:16:22.007
Even if the Mother tries to test Him

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:27.132
or tries to get puzzled,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.548
He never doubt Her.

00:16:32.464 --> 00:16:35.631
In Her Maya He cannot fall.

00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:40.631
He cannot fall into Her Maya because He's so innocent.

00:16:42.132 --> 00:16:46.256
He's like a churned out butter, out of the buttermilk.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.339
So this butter can never get dissolved back.

00:16:50.548 --> 00:16:54.798
In the same way, this child,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.298
which is pure innocence,

00:16:58.548 --> 00:17:01.840
never can be contaminated

00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:05.090
by the Maya of the Mother.

00:17:05.298 --> 00:17:10.381
Maya is the process by which you test people.

00:17:10.923 --> 00:17:12.965
You have to test them.

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:16.923
See, these days people are so clever, so intelligent,

00:17:17.132 --> 00:17:20.840
that it is beyond even Adi Shakti, beyond any Shakti,

00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:23.923
the way they try to cheat you.

00:17:24.132 --> 00:17:26.090
So many have cheated Me,

00:17:26.256 --> 00:17:28.673
but they are back in their seats again.

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:32.048
That's done not by Me, but by Shri Ganesha.

00:17:32.298 --> 00:17:34.840
He's just standing on all the sides.

00:17:35.048 --> 00:17:37.464
If you try to do anything like that,

00:17:37.673 --> 00:17:40.673
He'll hit you hard - I can't help it.

00:17:41.048 --> 00:17:44.090
Now, this one came on this earth

00:17:44.256 --> 00:17:48.256
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:52.971
Christ, I think, is more active than Shri Ganesha

00:17:53.182 --> 00:17:57.221
because Shri Ganesha is fat, He has a big belly,

00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:59.673
I think He takes time to hit you.

00:17:59.882 --> 00:18:02.173
But this Christ,

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:04.882
I don't know how He has hit people.

00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:09.798
All over the world there are diseases, diseases, diseases.

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:14.506
He has killed so many people.

00:18:14.882 --> 00:18:18.673
He's the one who used to ask for forgiveness

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:21.465
for the people who killed him.

00:18:21.673 --> 00:18:24.882
But He is so active, I have seen,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.506
that sometimes I tell people,

00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:30.590
don't talk ill of Me, its very dangerous.

00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:33.298
Don't talk against Me.

00:18:33.548 --> 00:18:36.923
In a very secret manner He exists

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.048
and the way He hits people is sometimes -

00:18:41.256 --> 00:18:46.298
it's dangerous. Even My eyes get filled up with tears.

00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:48.964
So I have to control both sides.

00:18:49.173 --> 00:18:54.590
One is Shri Ganesha, another side is Christ.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.923
There are two other people,

00:18:59.423 --> 00:19:03.381
Saint Michael and Gabriel.

00:19:03.882 --> 00:19:07.298
We call them

00:19:08.757 --> 00:19:11.423
in Sanskrit language

00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:14.548
as Bhairava and Hanumana,

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:18.757
and they incarnated as

00:19:20.256 --> 00:19:24.048
Buddha - Mahavira and Buddha.

00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:30.048
And the Buddhists are really, I tell you,

00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:34.298
are another kind of  perverts.

00:19:35.256 --> 00:19:38.381
It was said, Buddha said

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.298
that you should not get attached to anything;

00:19:41.548 --> 00:19:44.381
you shouldn't get attached to your money,

00:19:46.465 --> 00:19:50.048
to your wealth, to your family, to anything.

00:20:01.131 --> 00:20:03.173
That time,

00:20:03.381 --> 00:20:06.923
the attachment was very great, must have been,

00:20:07.882 --> 00:20:11.381
and this attachment he wanted them to

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.465
remove from the minds of the people.

00:20:14.673 --> 00:20:16.673
You cannot.

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:18.673
By removing your clothes,

00:20:18.882 --> 00:20:21.964
by wearing those saffron clothes,

00:20:22.506 --> 00:20:26.048
by shaving your heads, by walking bare feet,

00:20:26.256 --> 00:20:29.923
by torturing your body, you cannot.

00:20:30.173 --> 00:20:32.757
That's all outside.

00:20:33.089 --> 00:20:37.131
That's not real detachment. That's not Buddha at all.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.882
Neither Christ, nor Mahavira.

00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:46.757
What they said that you should get detached from within.

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:51.923
To get detached from within is very different

00:20:52.131 --> 00:20:56.506
than to get detached from outside.

00:20:58.048 --> 00:21:02.923
It's not how much you starve that you become Christ,

00:21:04.048 --> 00:21:09.048
or whether you move like Mahavira,

00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:12.882
that you become like Him,

00:21:14.131 --> 00:21:18.506
or you get saffron clothes

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:21.548
like Buddha, you become Buddha.

00:21:21.757 --> 00:21:25.173
So what a misconception they have

00:21:25.381 --> 00:21:29.423
of whatever was taught to people.

00:21:29.757 --> 00:21:34.089
That was the time when it was the days of tapasya,

00:21:34.423 --> 00:21:38.882
of penance, and that's why they said to do penance

00:21:39.048 --> 00:21:41.423
is best is to get rid of all these things

00:21:41.673 --> 00:21:46.506
so you will develop deeper into your being.

00:21:48.506 --> 00:21:51.131
Even in the Christian religion they started

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.048
these nuns and these, what you call them,

00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:56.798
the fathers and the mothers and the nuns,

00:21:56.964 --> 00:21:59.381
and all kinds of things.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.298
This is another artificial thing they started.

00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:08.590
By doing this, do you think you can become innocent?

00:22:11.298 --> 00:22:14.673
I have known nuns who are so horrible

00:22:14.882 --> 00:22:16.882
that you can't even look at them,

00:22:17.048 --> 00:22:19.673
they emit nothing but heat.

00:22:19.882 --> 00:22:23.882
And those priests, now you have heard about them,

00:22:24.089 --> 00:22:29.048
the way they are attacking the innocence of people.

00:22:31.131 --> 00:22:35.715
Buddhists are the worst, I should say, because

00:22:40.673 --> 00:22:44.632
they say, “Renounce, renounce everything.”

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.006
All right, renounce and beg.

00:22:50.006 --> 00:22:54.381
So you renounce everything and beg for gold.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.715
What do you say to this kind of a contradiction?

00:22:57.882 --> 00:23:01.923
And we have there, like Dalai Lama,

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:05.632
he is a universal beggar

00:23:06.298 --> 00:23:08.006
and people like it.

00:23:08.214 --> 00:23:09.840
People like if somebody is begging

00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:13.131
because their ego is pampered.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.673
Like he went to Los Angeles

00:23:15.882 --> 00:23:18.882
and all the actors and actresses had a very, very

00:23:19.048 --> 00:23:20.757
big conference and thought

00:23:20.923 --> 00:23:23.465
that by giving alms to this beggar

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:26.882
their innocence will come back.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.632
Can you believe such a story?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.006
Any sensible people has to understand,

00:23:32.214 --> 00:23:35.923
that by giving alms, how can your innocence come back?

00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:40.298
And so this fellow was again given lot of alms.

00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:43.089
He's got lot of gold and he's really

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:48.214
a goldy man, all the time collecting gold

00:23:48.423 --> 00:23:51.757
from here and gold from there and gold from you.

00:23:55.173 --> 00:23:59.214
Such people, incarnations, who came just to

00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:04.506
tell us to be detached, just to develop morality.

00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:09.173
If you are detached about your sex life,

00:24:09.423 --> 00:24:13.882
if you are detached about your financial side,

00:24:14.131 --> 00:24:17.506
if you are detached even from your country,

00:24:17.757 --> 00:24:20.131
then a detached personality of that kind

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.506
will become innocent and there will be no quarrel.

00:24:25.964 --> 00:24:29.882
But it's happening the other way around now.

00:24:33.548 --> 00:24:35.548
Same in the Islam.

00:24:35.757 --> 00:24:40.590
Whatever was taught in the Islam is taken on the other side.

00:24:40.798 --> 00:24:43.131
It cannot be in any way

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.882
where Mohammed Sahib was only insisting on morality.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.048
Any kind of immoral behavior He didn't want to have.

00:24:53.256 --> 00:24:55.923
He did say, at that time, you can marry more women

00:24:56.131 --> 00:24:57.964
because there were more women,

00:24:58.173 --> 00:25:01.964
but He never said you become prostitutes,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.423
you lead a life of sin.

00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:10.423
That was just a Samayachar, that was only

00:25:10.632 --> 00:25:13.882
that time, that was the problem. He said,   “All right.”

00:25:14.048 --> 00:25:16.882
For example, divorce was not allowed at that time,

00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:19.882
but in Sahaja Yoga we do allow divorce.

00:25:20.089 --> 00:25:23.089
But I have seen that without divorce

00:25:23.298 --> 00:25:26.964
they can't live, I mean, just an impossible situation

00:25:27.173 --> 00:25:29.798
because also women sometimes

00:25:30.006 --> 00:25:33.548
are extremely, extremely cruel

00:25:33.757 --> 00:25:37.340
and men sometimes are extremely peevish.

00:25:37.548 --> 00:25:41.715
Under these circumstances, how can they be companions?

00:25:42.632 --> 00:25:47.423
More women are immoral in this matter, I should say.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.048
First, it was the men who used to do immorality,

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.882
but now the women who are not only innocence,

00:25:54.089 --> 00:25:56.673
but also Shakti,

00:25:57.131 --> 00:26:00.548
are trying to get into

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.340
some sort of a shamelessness.

00:26:05.173 --> 00:26:10.048
No care of their own innocence.

00:26:10.715 --> 00:26:13.381
Their innocence is the Shakti.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:17.632
If a woman is not innocent, how can she have Shakti?

00:26:19.423 --> 00:26:22.590
If she is leading an immoral life,

00:26:22.923 --> 00:26:26.298
then her Shakti will be finished.

00:26:26.548 --> 00:26:31.173
Only her morality is her Shri Ganesha

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:36.256
which emits this purity in her.

00:26:40.089 --> 00:26:43.465
Now, I feel that

00:26:44.465 --> 00:26:47.964
the way people are pumping our heads with ideas,

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:50.673
especially from Hollywood,

00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:52.964
we accept them

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.840
and we forget that we are just hurting Shri Ganesha

00:26:58.048 --> 00:27:00.840
and He'll come back on us.

00:27:02.465 --> 00:27:05.381
It starts at a very low level

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.048
when we start hating our children.

00:27:11.214 --> 00:27:15.214
The problem starts when we don't understand our children.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.840
I mean, in England they say that two children are killed

00:27:20.006 --> 00:27:24.256
every week by parents.

00:27:27.757 --> 00:27:32.632
This kind of attitude towards children.

00:27:33.173 --> 00:27:36.131
First of all, they should not produce;

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.089
if they have produced then they are Shri Ganeshas.

00:27:39.298 --> 00:27:41.048
They have to respect,

00:27:41.256 --> 00:27:45.173
they have to love, and they have to encourage.

00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:47.757
But to spoil the children is also

00:27:47.923 --> 00:27:51.173
another kind of negative force, I think.

00:27:51.423 --> 00:27:54.590
Some people spoil their children.

00:27:56.298 --> 00:27:59.423
Ganesha can never be spoiled.

00:28:00.548 --> 00:28:04.381
You cannot spoil Him, because He is beyond Maya.

00:28:04.715 --> 00:28:08.548
But the way people run after their children sometimes

00:28:08.757 --> 00:28:09.964
is shocking.

00:28:10.173 --> 00:28:13.882
To them, that is the greatest achievement they have got,

00:28:14.048 --> 00:28:15.673
that they have a child.

00:28:15.882 --> 00:28:18.381
Even in a place like India

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:21.590
where it's an over population,

00:28:22.298 --> 00:28:24.632
to them their children are like,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.882
I don't know what, so attached.

00:28:28.089 --> 00:28:31.590
So this is a new attachment that has started

00:28:32.089 --> 00:28:38.173
which also gives you a kind of an immoral life,

00:28:41.256 --> 00:28:44.214
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:44.798 --> 00:28:47.340
For people who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:28:47.548 --> 00:28:50.757
all the children of the world are their own,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.632
not only your own children whom you love.

00:28:56.218 --> 00:28:59.102
All of them are Shri Ganeshas.

00:28:59.263 --> 00:29:02.214
Of course, if there's somebody who is not a good child

00:29:02.423 --> 00:29:05.840
or you find it difficult, its all right,

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:09.548
but otherwise all the children of this world

00:29:09.757 --> 00:29:12.632
are your own children

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.590
and you have to love them

00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:17.298
as you would love your own children.

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:20.347
Christ has said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."

00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:23.057
I don't know why He said it because in all

00:29:23.218 --> 00:29:27.427
Christian nations neighbors are the biggest problem.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.632
Even here.

00:29:33.506 --> 00:29:35.882
So I say, "Love thy child,

00:29:36.089 --> 00:29:39.298
love other children as thy children".

00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:42.340
Let’s start at that point, maybe after that.

00:29:42.548 --> 00:29:46.214
But normally there are places where they won't allow

00:29:46.423 --> 00:29:48.840
you to take a flat because you have children.

00:29:49.006 --> 00:29:51.048
I mean, imagine.

00:29:51.298 --> 00:29:56.632
Only unmarried people or barren people can live there.

00:29:56.882 --> 00:30:00.673
And also compulsory is that you should not have any child.

00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:02.882
Even today you may not have child

00:30:03.048 --> 00:30:05.823
but once you live there you should not have any child.

00:30:05.984 --> 00:30:11.233
If you have a child then you are ousted. Can you imagine?

00:30:11.882 --> 00:30:15.089
About only thirty years back, people had twelve children,

00:30:15.298 --> 00:30:18.882
fourteen children, they were competing in that

00:30:19.131 --> 00:30:20.882
and lived very happily.

00:30:21.048 --> 00:30:26.214
And these days the problem has become like this,

00:30:26.423 --> 00:30:29.506
that you should not have many children.

00:30:29.715 --> 00:30:34.173
Those who started the problem are having no children at all.

00:30:35.089 --> 00:30:37.715
Those who said should be controlled, see,

00:30:37.882 --> 00:30:42.214
anywhere in the west the growth is minus.

00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:45.006
Who is doing that? Shri Ganesh.

00:30:45.214 --> 00:30:48.882
You don't want children, all right.  Don't have.

00:30:49.423 --> 00:30:52.715
Except for Sahaja Yogis, nobody gets child.

00:30:53.048 --> 00:30:55.798
In this place, Mohan got his child first

00:30:55.964 --> 00:30:59.048
so in the whole village there was a celebration.

00:30:59.256 --> 00:31:03.798
There has been no child born here for years together.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.256
But then, again, the problem is like this.

00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:12.340
When I say this, I find Sahaja Yogis go to another extreme.

00:31:12.548 --> 00:31:17.340
They are stuck to their children; “stuck” actually is the word.

00:31:21.632 --> 00:31:24.548
Which is very wrong.

00:31:25.131 --> 00:31:27.923
I'm not saying you should neglect your child in any way,

00:31:28.131 --> 00:31:33.298
or you should in any way beat them or trouble them,

00:31:33.506 --> 00:31:35.298
all these things.

00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:38.715
You must love them in such a manner

00:31:39.256 --> 00:31:42.882
that they should know, if they do anything wrong

00:31:43.089 --> 00:31:45.506
they'll lose your love.

00:31:45.715 --> 00:31:50.340
Because for children love is the most important thing.

00:31:54.757 --> 00:31:57.798
They should know this, what you don't like.

00:31:57.964 --> 00:32:01.089
You should tell them what you don't like.

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.256
And you will be amazed

00:32:05.465 --> 00:32:10.964
how children will not do anything

00:32:11.214 --> 00:32:15.548
that will make you unhappy with them.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.381
Now that's a trick I think one has to learn.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.673
This is the best way to grow your children.

00:32:22.882 --> 00:32:25.423
I'll tell you a story of My own daughter.

00:32:25.632 --> 00:32:29.882
She went to Delhi and all the girls were having sleeveless blouses.

00:32:30.256 --> 00:32:33.590
So she asked Me,

00:32:33.798 --> 00:32:37.151
"I want to have sleeveless blouses."

00:32:37.312 --> 00:32:39.590
She was grown up, she was going to college.

00:32:39.798 --> 00:32:42.214
I said, "All right, have it, whatever you like."

00:32:42.423 --> 00:32:45.964
Then said, "By the way, why don't You wear sleeveless?"

00:32:46.173 --> 00:32:49.214
I said, "I feel shy."

00:32:50.923 --> 00:32:54.256
"Then why should You allow me?  This is no criteria.

00:32:54.465 --> 00:32:58.757
Whatever I ask, You say, ‘yes’ to me.  I'm not that grown up."

00:33:01.798 --> 00:33:04.298
Even My granddaughter, she was here,

00:33:04.506 --> 00:33:05.590
she asked Me,

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.673
"Nani, why do you wear always blouses with sleeves?"

00:33:09.882 --> 00:33:14.882
I said, "Do you know these are very important chakras,

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:18.256
the most important chakras for our body.

00:33:18.465 --> 00:33:21.715
If you keep them open, these two or these two,

00:33:21.882 --> 00:33:23.673
then you will have problems."

00:33:23.882 --> 00:33:27.964
"My goodness, I must wear now full sleeve."

00:33:28.214 --> 00:33:31.340
Immediately they understood.

00:33:31.632 --> 00:33:34.381
So something deep, if you tell them

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.423
in a deep manner which is respecting their innocence,

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.381
they will improve.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.381
For example, a child comes spoilt child,

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.048
he does very well in the class and all that.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.465
Now one way is to beat him up, shout at him,

00:33:50.673 --> 00:33:52.715
scold him - these are one.

00:33:52.882 --> 00:33:55.256
Another simple thing is

00:33:55.465 --> 00:33:59.840
to talk to him, “See, supposing you stand first,

00:34:00.298 --> 00:34:04.964
supposing you get good marks, you become a great man.

00:34:05.173 --> 00:34:08.882
How proud I will be.  Everybody will be proud of you.

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.923
But supposing you do not,

00:34:11.131 --> 00:34:13.840
then they will think, ‘Oh, he's a useless fellow,

00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:16.632
he'll have to beg on the street.’”

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.548
Immediately, he'll change.

00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:24.214
The handling of the children is very important.

00:34:24.798 --> 00:34:27.340
Innocence is to be handled

00:34:27.548 --> 00:34:29.632
in a very delicate manner

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.131
as you would handle a beautiful flower.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.840
It's a flower.

00:34:36.131 --> 00:34:41.256
As flower has fragrance, also innocence has fragrance.

00:34:41.715 --> 00:34:46.798
Now this Ganesha was made out of the Mother Earth.

00:35:06.882 --> 00:35:10.423
He was made out of Mother Earth.

00:35:11.006 --> 00:35:15.882
Mother Earth is the essence of innocence.

00:35:17.214 --> 00:35:19.256
See this Mother Earth,

00:35:19.548 --> 00:35:22.465
we don't look after, we don't give Her water,

00:35:22.673 --> 00:35:25.298
we don't do anything for Her,

00:35:25.506 --> 00:35:30.798
but how She's trying to enrich our life;

00:35:31.923 --> 00:35:35.882
how She's trying to cool us down;

00:35:36.882 --> 00:35:40.506
how She works out for us things

00:35:40.715 --> 00:35:45.173
which normally cannot be improved.

00:35:46.381 --> 00:35:51.214
To respect this Mother Earth  is very important

00:35:51.423 --> 00:35:54.938
for all the innocent people. They do.

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:57.715
I've seen children, they respect the Mother Earth.

00:35:57.882 --> 00:36:02.506
They like to play on the mud, they like to play on sands,

00:36:02.757 --> 00:36:05.882
they want to build castles,

00:36:11.381 --> 00:36:15.465
and all kinds of things they do with the Mother Earth.

00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:19.340
But they are not attached, that's one thing.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.923
They are not attached.They'll build a castle.

00:36:22.131 --> 00:36:24.882
All right, finished, now finish this.

00:36:25.048 --> 00:36:26.882
Then they go to the airport,

00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:31.006
there they find something, they all join to make it a joy.

00:36:31.298 --> 00:36:33.465
Wherever they go

00:36:33.673 --> 00:36:36.131
they find it easy to make that thing

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.882
for their enjoyment. To them, enjoyment is important.

00:36:41.672 --> 00:36:44.423
To them, yesterday, as I said time is not important.

00:36:44.632 --> 00:36:46.882
How much you enjoy is important.

00:36:47.048 --> 00:36:51.632
Time is a headache for the grown-ups.

00:36:51.882 --> 00:36:54.340
Children don't worry.

00:36:54.548 --> 00:36:58.506
You take them somewhere in a nice place

00:36:59.506 --> 00:37:02.419
so they don't want to come our way.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.423
You ask them, "Lets go home."

00:37:04.632 --> 00:37:08.757
"Why?  For what? Why should we go home?"

00:37:08.918 --> 00:37:11.501
They can't understand.

00:37:11.882 --> 00:37:17.006
They love all that is natural, all that is beautiful.

00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:21.298
They don't know the value in the money form.

00:37:21.506 --> 00:37:23.798
They know the value of something

00:37:23.964 --> 00:37:26.964
in the form of love.

00:37:28.131 --> 00:37:30.882
I have seen Myself,

00:37:31.173 --> 00:37:35.048
you see, if you give something to children

00:37:35.298 --> 00:37:39.381
they'll keep it there, even Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.298
and they'll show you, “I've got it.”

00:37:43.632 --> 00:37:49.757
See the essence of Shri Ganesha is pure love.

00:37:52.964 --> 00:37:56.882
The pure love of this Mother Earth

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.632
created Shri Ganesha,

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:04.131
or Adi Shakti created out of the pure love.

00:38:05.423 --> 00:38:06.923
But surprisingly,

00:38:07.131 --> 00:38:11.840
Shri Ganesha was created before the Mother Earth,

00:38:12.214 --> 00:38:14.048
so how it is?

00:38:14.256 --> 00:38:17.506
So first He was created only

00:38:17.715 --> 00:38:20.882
as the Logos, as they call it, or we call it

00:38:21.089 --> 00:38:24.423
the Brahmanadha, Omkara.

00:38:24.882 --> 00:38:29.423
First He was created only as the sound of Omkara.

00:38:30.006 --> 00:38:32.632
Then this Omkara

00:38:32.882 --> 00:38:36.632
was covered with the Mother Earth

00:38:36.964 --> 00:38:40.214
to make Shri Ganesha.

00:38:40.673 --> 00:38:46.381
So, Omkar is so important

00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:51.256
because it has got in it

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:57.173
all the three powers, A-U-M.

00:38:59.256 --> 00:39:04.298
A-U-M stands for the Mahakali,

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.715
Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi's powers.

00:39:09.506 --> 00:39:13.923
All these three powers exist in this Omkara.

00:39:14.506 --> 00:39:17.673
So in a dormant form, we can say

00:39:17.882 --> 00:39:21.923
those three powers exist in Shri Ganesha.

00:39:22.173 --> 00:39:27.757
So when we try to harm Him,

00:39:28.006 --> 00:39:32.214
then we are harming the Shakti within us,

00:39:32.673 --> 00:39:35.590
which is Omkar,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.590
which fills the whole universe,

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.964
which fills all the vibrations.

00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:46.882
In the vibrations these powers move.

00:39:47.256 --> 00:39:51.256
These three powers fill up every vibration.

00:39:51.715 --> 00:39:54.423
That's why they know, they understand

00:39:54.632 --> 00:39:59.381
and they work out the whole thing in such a manner that...

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.757
Supposing now somebody has broken his legs,

00:40:02.923 --> 00:40:05.465
take it like that.

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:10.006
Now, I sit down here and may give a bandhan.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.465
Immediately, immediately,

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:20.623
a power is sent, immediately.

00:40:21.498 --> 00:40:23.373
Somehow,

00:40:23.665 --> 00:40:27.956
is faster than all your communications that you use

00:40:28.498 --> 00:40:31.914
and immediately things work out.

00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:39.123
How it works out? Now it's a very complicated stuff,

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.998
but it’s also very uncomplicated because

00:40:43.206 --> 00:40:46.331
it is the work of Shri Ganesh.

00:40:48.081 --> 00:40:50.373
He's not interested.

00:40:50.582 --> 00:40:53.123
You see, if there's any problem, all right,

00:40:53.331 --> 00:40:57.623
like making a little fort on the seashore;

00:40:57.832 --> 00:41:02.039
All right, it will melt it, finished, back again.

00:41:02.498 --> 00:41:05.498
He's not attached.

00:41:06.832 --> 00:41:09.873
So what should we do

00:41:10.498 --> 00:41:14.164
to show our gratitude to this little child?

00:41:16.081 --> 00:41:18.623
Supposing you say to a child, “Thank you.”

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:21.415
He’ll say, “Hey, what did you say?"

00:41:21.623 --> 00:41:23.873
Won't understand, children don't understand

00:41:24.034 --> 00:41:25.826
why should we thank them.

00:41:25.987 --> 00:41:27.654
We teach them say "thank you,"

00:41:27.815 --> 00:41:30.975
so even if they have to say "sorry", they’ll say "thank you"

00:41:31.136 --> 00:41:35.164
because they know only one word, "thank you". So they say "thank you".

00:41:35.456 --> 00:41:37.248
Now these children,

00:41:37.456 --> 00:41:41.956
how will they play, in the same way this Omkara plays.

00:41:43.665 --> 00:41:49.415
Most detached, as they call "Nishkriya", to the power.

00:41:49.623 --> 00:41:52.039
Means doesn't do anything.

00:41:52.331 --> 00:41:54.498
Nothing, just paying attention.

00:41:54.707 --> 00:41:57.914
If somebody gets cured, gets saved,

00:41:58.164 --> 00:42:02.456
somebody gets vibrations,

00:42:03.123 --> 00:42:05.707
who does it?  Shri Ganesh.

00:42:06.998 --> 00:42:12.081
But He is not attached, He's not attached,

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.415
He doesn't want any credit for it.  It's His job.

00:42:15.623 --> 00:42:18.206
He will send one Ganas, all right, go to... fast .

00:42:18.415 --> 00:42:20.206
They will run fast,

00:42:20.415 --> 00:42:24.415
more than any one of your modern - the most modern

00:42:24.623 --> 00:42:27.790
vehicle that you have as aeroplanes or anything.

00:42:27.956 --> 00:42:31.415
Immediately, I'm telling you again, the word is that.

00:42:31.623 --> 00:42:35.164
Just as if you press the button, it works.

00:42:35.373 --> 00:42:38.498
But on some people it does not,

00:42:38.707 --> 00:42:42.206
if they are surrounded by people who have no faith,

00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:45.373
if they themselves have half faith or something.

00:42:45.582 --> 00:42:50.498
He is the judge of your faith in the Mother

00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:56.707
because He has absolute faith in His Mother - absolutely.

00:42:56.998 --> 00:43:03.331
In the same way, those who have absolute faith in His Mother,

00:43:04.914 --> 00:43:08.456
He looks after them.

00:43:08.832 --> 00:43:11.832
He really looks after them.

00:43:11.998 --> 00:43:15.123
Also He destroys.

00:43:20.498 --> 00:43:24.039
Once a person told Me

00:43:24.248 --> 00:43:27.415
about a minister in India,

00:43:27.623 --> 00:43:30.123
a very nasty fellow,

00:43:30.331 --> 00:43:34.582
very corrupt, immoral, everything put together.

00:43:35.283 --> 00:43:38.408
He was going on, carrying on,

00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:42.122
but this was a nice Sahaja Yogi, very good Sahaja Yogi. He told Me

00:43:42.283 --> 00:43:45.170
that this man has now started troubling him

00:43:45.331 --> 00:43:48.028
and wants him to do something dishonest.

00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:53.331
I said, “Really?” I said, “Really here and there".

00:43:53.582 --> 00:43:57.998
This great minister had to resign and go away.

00:43:59.471 --> 00:44:02.095
That moment.

00:44:02.296 --> 00:44:06.171
Is a fact.  I can show you so many such things,

00:44:06.415 --> 00:44:12.581
but the faith of Shri Ganesha is tremendous.

00:44:15.187 --> 00:44:19.979
He never doubts, and He's not attached.

00:44:20.182 --> 00:44:21.587
So many people sometimes,

00:44:21.748 --> 00:44:24.665
"Mother, you know we did this, we went there,

00:44:24.832 --> 00:44:28.415
we had to climb up so much, and then we gave realization

00:44:28.623 --> 00:44:33.206
only to one person". Finished.

00:44:34.036 --> 00:44:36.786
What's the use?  Don't give any realization.

00:44:36.947 --> 00:44:38.994
I have told hundred times to people,

00:44:39.155 --> 00:44:42.313
if you think you are doing any work, better not do it.

00:44:42.473 --> 00:44:45.348
It's no good doing such work.

00:44:45.598 --> 00:44:48.682
If you are attached to it, then better not do it.

00:44:48.848 --> 00:44:53.931
You do it for fun, just for joy, just for faith in your Mother.

00:44:56.223 --> 00:44:58.682
With this absolute faith you never feel fatigued,

00:44:58.848 --> 00:45:02.223
you never feel tired. You see Shri Ganesha's work.

00:45:02.432 --> 00:45:04.432
All these bandhans, who carries?

00:45:06.039 --> 00:45:09.456
Shriman Ganesh Mahoday.

00:45:12.682 --> 00:45:17.140
He, with His big belly,

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.931
just orders His people,

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.390
and these Ganeshas, Ganas,

00:45:22.598 --> 00:45:26.723
are the most competent people you can find.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:32.098
You get Me any competent person, any scientist,

00:45:33.598 --> 00:45:36.223
no one can beat them.

00:45:36.557 --> 00:45:39.557
How can they cure a person?

00:45:39.848 --> 00:45:44.515
Say a lady had a son in Mexico who was sick

00:45:44.848 --> 00:45:48.598
and he had a fatal disease which was in their family

00:45:48.764 --> 00:45:52.682
but they always used to get it at an age

00:45:52.889 --> 00:45:56.432
when they were very old.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.682
But he was a young boy studying in Harvard.

00:45:59.931 --> 00:46:02.383
She wrote to Me three letters

00:46:02.544 --> 00:46:05.711
and in these three letters she was wondering, “What should I do?

00:46:05.872 --> 00:46:09.223
Should I send him to You?” And I was, you see,

00:46:09.432 --> 00:46:12.265
jumping from one tree to another tree.

00:46:12.473 --> 00:46:14.806
I said, "Where would you meet Me?"

00:46:15.014 --> 00:46:17.306
I just thought of it,

00:46:17.515 --> 00:46:20.140
and fourth letter comes in, that she took him

00:46:20.348 --> 00:46:23.640
to the hospital in Harvard University

00:46:23.806 --> 00:46:27.056
and there she took him to some other hospital,

00:46:27.265 --> 00:46:29.313
and all the hospitals declared that

00:46:29.473 --> 00:46:33.014
he is absolutely all right, he's completely cured.

00:46:37.348 --> 00:46:42.682
But, your faith. Her faith has worked.

00:46:43.306 --> 00:46:47.265
It is the mother's faith has worked for the son.

00:46:48.265 --> 00:46:52.056
It’s very easy to doubt Me, it's very easy.

00:46:52.348 --> 00:46:56.806
It's a slippery ground, I tell you, very easy to doubt Me.

00:46:59.014 --> 00:47:01.973
Because people doubt people for what they wear.

00:47:02.181 --> 00:47:04.098
Now they will say,

00:47:04.306 --> 00:47:06.889
"Why was She wearing such an expensive sari?"

00:47:07.098 --> 00:47:12.764
This is a selection of Mr. Guido the great, not Mine.

00:47:14.682 --> 00:47:17.889
He forced Me to buy this.

00:47:19.557 --> 00:47:22.390
What can I do?

00:47:23.682 --> 00:47:30.056
But I'm not attached, but to keep his spirits all right

00:47:31.973 --> 00:47:35.557
I wear it, just to please them.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.473
Even children, you will be surprised,

00:47:40.682 --> 00:47:45.056
they feel very pleased if you do something that they like.

00:47:46.348 --> 00:47:48.764
They are very, very,

00:47:49.053 --> 00:47:52.542
I shouldn't say intelligent because I don't like that word very much

00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:56.203
but I should say, very subtly understanding things.

00:47:58.014 --> 00:48:02.014
One of My granddaughters, eldest one, she's a gem of a gem.

00:48:02.473 --> 00:48:07.515
She, I took for her a Wendy's house and she built it up.

00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:10.598
And My daughter is quite tall.

00:48:10.764 --> 00:48:13.515
She called her, “Mummy, come to my house."

00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:16.056
So this daughter of Mine went there

00:48:16.265 --> 00:48:18.306
and she entered inside the house

00:48:18.515 --> 00:48:21.098
and she broke the whole thing.

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.645
So it is, my granddaughter came to Me,

00:48:23.806 --> 00:48:25.348
"See. Look at your daughter.

00:48:25.509 --> 00:48:28.550
You have taught her no manners of any kind."

00:48:28.889 --> 00:48:32.306
I said, "Why, what happened?”, "She comes into my house

00:48:32.515 --> 00:48:35.014
and asks such an unmannerly question,

00:48:35.175 --> 00:48:37.008
‘What have you got for me to eat?’

00:48:37.169 --> 00:48:40.025
Do you do that when you are going into somebody's house?

00:48:40.186 --> 00:48:41.645
Do you ask such a question?

00:48:41.806 --> 00:48:44.098
And when I said, ‘You can't ask such a question

00:48:44.306 --> 00:48:45.515
in somebody else’s house,’

00:48:45.682 --> 00:48:48.848
she laughed so much that she broke my house.

00:48:49.105 --> 00:48:52.669
Is this the way to behave? You have never taught them.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.014
Grandma you have taught us everything nice.

00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:57.385
You have never taught her how to behave

00:48:57.546 --> 00:48:59.515
when you go to somebody's house.”

00:48:59.682 --> 00:49:02.306
You see?  So innocent.

00:49:03.181 --> 00:49:05.764
So innocent the whole thing was,

00:49:06.056 --> 00:49:09.265
that just to please her,

00:49:09.515 --> 00:49:13.598
even a small thing if you do, you can please them.

00:49:13.848 --> 00:49:15.889
Very simple thing.

00:49:16.265 --> 00:49:19.390
Now His power is Kundalini.

00:49:19.598 --> 00:49:22.473
Well, this is another problem.

00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:26.889
She is the power of Shri Ganesha

00:49:27.223 --> 00:49:31.432
and without Him She won't rise.

00:49:32.098 --> 00:49:35.598
What a complication - now tell Me.

00:49:37.557 --> 00:49:41.098
Like, if My child says,

00:49:41.348 --> 00:49:46.140
"You can't go out of this house without asking me",

00:49:47.223 --> 00:49:49.306
so you can't just do anything,

00:49:49.557 --> 00:49:52.682
you are bound to the house.

00:49:53.306 --> 00:49:54.931
So in the same way,

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.931
without taking the permission of Shri Ganesha,

00:49:59.223 --> 00:50:01.973
Kundalini won't rise.

00:50:02.223 --> 00:50:05.265
It's very difficult,

00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:09.931
impossible I should say.

00:50:11.056 --> 00:50:14.056
Of course, the Mooladhara will go on like this,

00:50:14.265 --> 00:50:18.306
pumping just like a heart,

00:50:19.306 --> 00:50:21.222
but it won't come up

00:50:21.382 --> 00:50:24.006
because Kundalini would like to do

00:50:24.215 --> 00:50:27.756
but He won't allow Her to go.

00:50:29.798 --> 00:50:32.131
Those who are immoral,

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.131
those who have done immoral things,

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.632
and those who are spoiling

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:42.714
the Ganesha principle of others,

00:50:42.923 --> 00:50:46.090
are very difficult for realization.

00:50:46.465 --> 00:50:49.215
But I have seen some people

00:50:49.423 --> 00:50:52.673
who have asked for forgiveness

00:50:53.215 --> 00:50:56.548
and the Mother has told Shri Ganesh to forgive,

00:50:56.714 --> 00:50:59.465
they have got realization.

00:50:59.632 --> 00:51:01.881
Only that's the point,

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.590
that if you approach through the Mother,

00:51:04.756 --> 00:51:06.756
He will forgive you.

00:51:06.964 --> 00:51:09.298
Definitely, He'll forgive you.

00:51:09.507 --> 00:51:11.964
There is such a nice

00:51:12.173 --> 00:51:15.923
relationship between the mother and child.

00:51:16.426 --> 00:51:19.714
That's something good, otherwise this fellow would have killed

00:51:19.875 --> 00:51:24.041
at least ninety percent of people in the modern times.

00:51:26.548 --> 00:51:32.590
So it is such a blessing, also,

00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:36.839
such a promise,

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:41.382
that if we look after our Shri Ganesh principle,

00:51:42.465 --> 00:51:44.839
keep ourselves clean,

00:51:45.048 --> 00:51:47.215
keep our eyes clean,

00:51:47.465 --> 00:51:52.714
and develop pure relationships among ourselves,

00:51:55.756 --> 00:52:00.173
we'll have no problem of any kind.

00:52:00.507 --> 00:52:03.173
You'll have proper relations with your wife,

00:52:03.382 --> 00:52:06.131
proper relations with your children,

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:09.507
and proper relations in the family,

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.256
proper relations in the society,

00:52:13.632 --> 00:52:18.881
proper relations in the politics, economics,

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:24.340
and all various areas in which you move.

00:52:25.215 --> 00:52:28.548
Your innocence will help.

00:52:29.215 --> 00:52:33.256
You might think that people are trying to befool you.

00:52:33.798 --> 00:52:39.798
Let them try and you see what happens.

00:52:41.298 --> 00:52:45.590
Let them try to attack your innocence

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:49.382
and see what they get out of it.

00:52:52.298 --> 00:52:57.590
It is such a blessing you all have as human beings,

00:52:58.006 --> 00:53:00.423
that your Mooladhara is so well developed

00:53:00.632 --> 00:53:03.173
and Shri Ganesha is nicely settled down.

00:53:03.382 --> 00:53:05.632
You all have got your realization

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:08.465
and now whatever we were enjoying -

00:53:08.673 --> 00:53:12.632
- yesterday, just like children, don't you think so?

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.123
We had forgotten our age, everything,

00:53:15.284 --> 00:53:18.173
we were just like children enjoying everything,

00:53:18.382 --> 00:53:21.215
whether the dance were rhythmic, unrhythmic

00:53:21.423 --> 00:53:24.756
or inconsistent, we didn't mind.

00:53:26.507 --> 00:53:28.798
Everything we enjoyed.

00:53:29.048 --> 00:53:32.632
No rules, regulations are needed for enjoyment.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.131
And this enjoyment, the source of this enjoyment,

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.548
comes from the innocence that we have within us.

00:53:40.881 --> 00:53:42.256
Without innocence,

00:53:42.465 --> 00:53:45.881
you cannot enjoy anything with this mind

00:53:46.632 --> 00:53:50.298
and from this heart,

00:53:51.006 --> 00:53:56.798
because in the heart resides the father,

00:53:58.964 --> 00:54:02.006
Shiva.

00:54:02.298 --> 00:54:05.507
They are terrible people,

00:54:05.923 --> 00:54:09.298
snakes around them.

00:54:10.006 --> 00:54:11.131
You...

00:54:13.673 --> 00:54:17.173
Not easy...

00:54:17.465 --> 00:54:21.714
If you can stand on your feet for fifteen years

00:54:21.923 --> 00:54:24.548
and go on saying,

00:54:24.756 --> 00:54:27.173
“Om Namaha Shivaya, Om Namaha Shivaya”,

00:54:27.382 --> 00:54:32.964
then maybe Shiva might grant you some boon.

00:54:33.507 --> 00:54:38.090
It's the most difficult deity to please, is Shiva.

00:54:38.632 --> 00:54:41.131
Though He is very innocent Himself,

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.673
He is too innocent, so much so,

00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:45.756
just like a white cloth you can say.

00:54:45.964 --> 00:54:51.881
Any bit of spot on your character, finished,

00:54:52.215 --> 00:54:54.632
condemned.

00:54:55.673 --> 00:55:00.340
But even a rakshasa stands on his leg

00:55:00.548 --> 00:55:03.215
for twenty-five years maybe

00:55:03.423 --> 00:55:07.714
and goes on praising Him, then He may forgive.

00:55:11.507 --> 00:55:14.048
Shri Ganesha doesn't forgive.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:18.131
So the only person left to you is your Mother,

00:55:18.756 --> 00:55:20.798
who just forgives.

00:55:21.006 --> 00:55:24.423
I don't want to have any headache of this not-forgivingness.

00:55:24.584 --> 00:55:28.305
It's a big headache. If you don't forgive somebody, I get a headache,

00:55:28.465 --> 00:55:31.756
so I don't want Myself to do that.

00:55:31.964 --> 00:55:36.923
So I just forgive. I forgive.

00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:42.798
I forgive all the Sahaja yogis all the time.

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:46.465
There have been some horrible, nasty fellows.

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:50.714
I don't want to be angry with them because Ganesha will

00:55:50.923 --> 00:55:52.382
just finish them.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:55.756
Automatically, Ganesha is doing something,

00:55:56.006 --> 00:55:59.131
but at least He doesn't do it so fast

00:55:59.507 --> 00:56:03.340
because they have called Me Mother and I respect it.

00:56:04.507 --> 00:56:07.673
Of course, they have been very troublesome, horrible, I know.

00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:11.465
I know why you are angry with them,

00:56:13.298 --> 00:56:18.006
but forgiveness is the best punishment

00:56:19.423 --> 00:56:24.215
by which they realize their mistakes

00:56:24.798 --> 00:56:28.548
and out of hundred, ninety-nine people

00:56:28.714 --> 00:56:32.798
will enjoy forgiveness than punishment.

00:56:36.632 --> 00:56:40.756
So all this is done by Shri Ganesha

00:56:41.756 --> 00:56:44.923
and He is all the time with you.

00:56:45.173 --> 00:56:48.548
Your Ganesha is awakened, no doubt.

00:56:48.798 --> 00:56:51.173
He is all the time with you.

00:56:51.423 --> 00:56:54.632
But some people have vibrations,

00:56:54.839 --> 00:56:58.450
they get realization, then they are busy,

00:56:58.611 --> 00:57:01.353
say, if they are women, busy with their children,

00:57:01.514 --> 00:57:04.972
they have no time for Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:05.756 --> 00:57:08.826
At the most, cleansing they'll do. But for what?

00:57:08.987 --> 00:57:11.237
Why are you cleansing?  Supposing this glass

00:57:11.398 --> 00:57:13.179
is cleansed, cleansed, cleansed,

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.465
and never used, what is the use of cleansing?

00:57:17.256 --> 00:57:19.673
They meditate for themselves,

00:57:19.881 --> 00:57:22.465
they cleanse for themselves,

00:57:22.632 --> 00:57:25.048
but never use their vibrations,

00:57:25.256 --> 00:57:29.632
never give vibrations.  How can that be?

00:57:31.048 --> 00:57:34.215
You have to give vibrations.

00:57:34.423 --> 00:57:36.423
If you don't give vibrations to others,

00:57:36.632 --> 00:57:38.632
if you don't transform other people,

00:57:38.839 --> 00:57:40.548
if you don't cure other people,

00:57:40.714 --> 00:57:44.798
if you don't teach them how to have pure love,

00:57:45.006 --> 00:57:48.256
what's the use of cleansing, coming to Puja,

00:57:48.465 --> 00:57:51.340
feeling nice, joyous?  Finished.

00:57:51.881 --> 00:57:57.507
These are useless people, useless Sahaja Yogis.

00:57:58.507 --> 00:58:01.423
Ganesha is not happy.

00:58:01.632 --> 00:58:03.006
How can He be happy?

00:58:03.215 --> 00:58:07.465
His Puja is to give realization.

00:58:08.465 --> 00:58:10.548
That is His Puja.

00:58:10.714 --> 00:58:13.590
Supposing He is waiting there, say,

00:58:13.798 --> 00:58:17.048
for you to ask for His blessings.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:21.590
Now what is His blessing?  Is to give realization,

00:58:21.839 --> 00:58:24.090
to allow the Kundalini to rise.

00:58:24.298 --> 00:58:28.964
You ask for it and what do you get?

00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:34.090
You ask for your health, ask for this, ask for that.

00:58:34.465 --> 00:58:36.632
Why not ask,

00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:40.673
"Shri Ganesh, make us good instruments of Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:40.881 --> 00:58:44.465
Give us strength to give realization to people

00:58:44.632 --> 00:58:47.340
and talk about Sahaja Yoga."

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:50.090
People don't even talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:50.298 --> 00:58:54.090
They are feeling shy.  Why should you be shy?

00:58:54.498 --> 00:58:56.582
One day I was traveling by train,

00:58:56.748 --> 00:58:58.954
I met a lady, she sat next to Me

00:58:59.115 --> 00:59:01.944
and she was following some sort of a cult, I don’t know,

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:03.914
some Muslim cult,

00:59:04.075 --> 00:59:06.415
and the whole time she was boring Me.

00:59:06.582 --> 00:59:08.789
I started feeling sleepy

00:59:08.998 --> 00:59:11.415
but whenever I got up she was still talking

00:59:11.582 --> 00:59:12.873
about that cult.

00:59:13.081 --> 00:59:15.623
I said, "Sahaja Yogis will never do that."

00:59:15.831 --> 00:59:18.415
You must talk about it.  You must tell people.

00:59:18.582 --> 00:59:20.165
You must go around.

00:59:20.373 --> 00:59:23.873
Don't be afraid, Ganesha will protect you.

00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:26.582
He'll help you, He'll be very happy.

00:59:27.165 --> 00:59:29.748
He'll work it out, everything for you.

00:59:29.956 --> 00:59:32.040
All problems can be solved.

00:59:32.248 --> 00:59:33.748
Everything can be done.

00:59:33.956 --> 00:59:38.789
Believe in His power.

00:59:39.248 --> 00:59:41.290
Have faith in your Mother.

00:59:41.498 --> 00:59:44.332
That is the message of Shri Ganesha.

00:59:44.574 --> 00:59:47.139
May God bless you.

00:59:53.081 --> 00:59:56.873
Today of course I would like chidren to come up for the Puja,

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:03.290
say, they should be all below six years, would be better idea.

01:00:06.123 --> 01:00:08.873
Say, from two years to six years, we could have small ones.

01:00:09.457 --> 01:00:12.998
Or maybe eight years, but then they grow up I think, after that.
