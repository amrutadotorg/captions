05:23.198 --> 05:29.738
Today, we are celebrating the birth of Jesus
Christ.

05:38.298 --> 05:52.878
The birth of Jesus Christ is very symbolic,
because

05:52.878 --> 06:03.698
he was born
in such a manner that even the poorest of

06:03.698 --> 06:10.128
poor won’t be born in the stable.

06:10.128 --> 06:35.228
And he was put in the
bed which was made of dried grass.

06:35.228 --> 06:52.258
He came on this earth to show people that
for a person who is an incarnation or who

06:52.258 --> 07:11.987
is a highly evolved soul, is not bothered
about the comfort of the body.

07:11.987 --> 07:35.098
His message was so great and so deep, but
he had disciples who were not prepared for

07:35.098 --> 07:39.797
the battle they had to fight.

07:39.797 --> 07:44.868
Is the same thing that sometimes happens with
Sahaja Yoga.

07:44.868 --> 08:02.597
He had only 12 disciples, we too have 12 types
of Sahaja Yogis, and all of them, though [they]

08:02.597 --> 08:12.428
try to dedicate themselves to Christ, fell
a trap, some of them, to the worldly aspirations

08:12.428 --> 08:25.207
or to their own hankerings.

08:25.207 --> 08:34.748
His message of love and forgiveness is the
same even today.

08:34.748 --> 08:43.327
Preached by all, all the saints, all the incarnations,
all the prophets.

08:43.327 --> 08:52.218
They all have said about love and forgiveness.

08:52.218 --> 09:22.168
If it was challenged or people felt that this
won’t work out, they were asked to have

09:22.168 --> 09:29.848
faith in what he said.

09:29.848 --> 09:40.367
But they were simple people in those days
so they obeyed him.

09:40.367 --> 09:50.387
Some of them definitely were very good, some
of them half-baked and few of them were people

09:50.387 --> 09:57.598
who were doubting.

09:57.598 --> 10:11.598
He came on this earth to prepare for us our
Agya chakra and despite all his efforts one

10:11.598 --> 10:20.698
finds very difficult and the people who follow
Christianity have the worst type of Agya.

10:20.698 --> 10:25.287
Worst type!

10:25.287 --> 10:31.177
Extremely aggressive, extremely planning type,
futuristic.

10:31.177 --> 10:45.117
I mean all the troubles of the right side
are found in those countries who claim to

10:45.117 --> 10:50.318
be Christians.

10:50.318 --> 10:56.207
Even the early Christians who were Gnostics,
‘gne’, ‘gne’ in Sanskrit means ‘know’,

10:56.207 --> 11:05.027
though [they] had the knowledge, the beginners
were also suppressed and tortured by the people

11:05.027 --> 11:11.968
who were supposed to be in charge of Christian
religion.

11:11.968 --> 11:19.317
And so many Christians were massacred by the
so-called Christian priests and Christian

11:19.317 --> 11:26.837
churches, and still it is going on.

11:26.837 --> 11:40.498
What you find in the west is a great influence
of these churches on the minds of the people.

11:40.498 --> 11:46.447
Otherwise they are supposed to be intellectuals,
otherwise they are supposed to be analytical,

11:46.447 --> 11:50.027
otherwise they are supposed to be something
very brainy.

11:50.027 --> 11:58.577
But when it comes to temples and churches,
when it come to religion, when it comes to

11:58.577 --> 12:08.567
Christianity, I think their brains are blocked,
completely blocked, by some sort of a mesmerism.

12:08.567 --> 12:18.117
They just can’t think that there could be
something very wrong with these people.

12:18.117 --> 12:27.737
When living in Italy, I found or I was shocked
how this catholic church was working out and

12:27.737 --> 12:35.787
what the priests were doing and all kinds
of scandals much more than we have in our

12:35.787 --> 12:36.787
country!

12:36.787 --> 12:46.638
Money bungling and molesting women and having
children – I mean every sort of dirty habit

12:46.638 --> 12:47.967
they had.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.467
Supposed to be priests.

12:49.467 --> 12:56.707
They were called ‘fathers’, they were
called ‘mothers’, they were called ‘sisters’,

12:56.707 --> 12:59.128
they were called ‘brothers’.

12:59.128 --> 13:07.858
And to me it was really a shock – I didn’t
know that such things are happening in the

13:07.858 --> 13:12.948
name of Christ.

13:12.948 --> 13:19.698
What Christ tried to show through his birth:
there is no need to have very comfortable,

13:19.698 --> 13:28.467
great birth in a big hospital in London, no!

13:28.467 --> 13:39.378
The simplicity of his birth should have made
all the Christians extremely simple and not

13:39.378 --> 13:41.748
at all money oriented.

13:41.748 --> 13:48.347
For money they went all round, crushed so
many people all over the world, when you go

13:48.347 --> 14:00.347
to Brazil or to Chile or to Argentina, you
do not find a single man belonging to the

14:00.347 --> 14:07.108
aboriginal people and they’re so unkind
to them.

14:07.108 --> 14:13.878
Unbelievable how aggressive these people are.

14:13.878 --> 14:20.048
Even in England, where theres protestants
I find the same thing among them.

14:20.048 --> 14:26.378
You must go on saying “thank you, thank
you” morning till evening, otherwise you

14:26.378 --> 14:28.148
are finished.

14:28.148 --> 14:29.148
Racialism.

14:29.148 --> 14:34.338
What was the race of Christ?

14:34.338 --> 14:35.917
Was he a fair man?

14:35.917 --> 14:36.917
No!

14:36.917 --> 14:37.917
Was he a white person?

14:37.917 --> 14:40.308
Not at all!

14:40.308 --> 14:41.488
What was His colour?

14:41.488 --> 14:44.397
He was brown like Indians.

14:44.397 --> 14:51.527
From where does this racialism come to these
Westerners?

14:51.527 --> 14:54.188
I just don’t understand.

14:54.188 --> 15:03.167
It has nothing to do with Christ or if it
is real Christianity.

15:03.167 --> 15:11.808
You go anywhere, you’ll be surprised, how
the faithful, simple-hearted people are misused

15:11.808 --> 15:13.967
by these churches.

15:13.967 --> 15:25.498
They’re used for voting, they’re used
for money, for everything – to such an extent

15:25.498 --> 15:38.988
that money was made, artificially counterfeited
in billions, by the church itself.

15:38.988 --> 15:52.118
Such autocracy, such control, such authority
they had that whatever they did was, the pope

15:52.118 --> 15:57.588
is infallible, whatever he does is alright.

15:57.588 --> 16:07.417
No idea of sinning, no idea of hell, no idea
of Christ – which was nothing but purity

16:07.417 --> 16:11.558
and innocence.

16:11.558 --> 16:20.508
Christ had taken a hunter and hit all the
people who were selling in front of the temple,

16:20.508 --> 16:22.608
because God cannot be sold.

16:22.608 --> 16:26.568
They were not selling God, they were selling
only goods, but he said the respect of the

16:26.568 --> 16:33.358
temple, talked about the respect of the temple.

16:33.358 --> 16:40.198
Another great thing Christians have done,
is to blame Jews for killing Christ.

16:40.198 --> 16:41.198
Wonderful!

16:41.198 --> 16:51.277
Put all the blame on others, this is the speciality
of Christians even today, is to put the blame

16:51.277 --> 16:54.528
of what wrong you are doing on others, very
common.

16:54.528 --> 17:04.587
And this is what you see very clearly in those
countries, who call themselves Christians.

17:04.587 --> 17:06.017
They blamed Jews.

17:06.017 --> 17:12.828
First of all, those who were Jews at that
time might have been Indians later on.

17:12.828 --> 17:15.808
Alright, so they don’t believe in reincarnation.

17:15.808 --> 17:22.467
I mean to say the same Jews who were there
are born again.

17:22.467 --> 17:36.108
Thirdly that the Jews never killed Christ,
never, because in the multitude how can you

17:36.108 --> 17:37.108
decide?

17:37.108 --> 17:45.217
Is the judge who decided and ordered, he was
a Roman.

17:45.217 --> 17:52.818
So the Roman empire didn’t want to take
the responsibility of His death so they said

17:52.818 --> 17:55.708
Jews have killed Him.

17:55.708 --> 18:05.128
So Mr Hitler got after them and he really
tortured them, really it’s too much, one

18:05.128 --> 18:15.378
can’t even understand how can – he believed
in catholic religion, how could he kill small

18:15.378 --> 18:21.097
little children, in the gas chamber?

18:21.097 --> 18:31.707
But now the same people who were tortured
are also becoming very aggressive and now

18:31.707 --> 18:39.037
they are against the Palestinians and the
Palestinians on their own are Muslims and

18:39.037 --> 18:44.008
the Muslims are playing a havoc all over.

18:44.008 --> 18:57.908
So when you go through the history, and see
the life of Christ, what do you find is aggressiveness

18:57.908 --> 19:04.948
from one to another, from that to another,
passing from one to another.

19:04.948 --> 19:14.837
If somebody slaps somebody, the another person
will try to kill that person.

19:14.837 --> 19:22.227
So this religion has created this divisiveness;
people are just killing each other in the

19:22.227 --> 19:27.277
name of God, in the name of religion.

19:27.277 --> 19:32.648
Even in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be surprised,
I have seen people taking advantage of my

19:32.648 --> 19:39.087
name, and trying to get into some mesmeric
groups.

19:39.087 --> 19:42.818
I can’t understand.

19:42.818 --> 19:48.837
Using my name, using my photograph!

19:48.837 --> 19:58.108
So beware this should not happen to you people.

19:58.108 --> 20:11.647
Using the name of Christ, the Incarnation
of Divine Love, they are doing all these works

20:11.647 --> 20:20.467
of violence, hatred, of cheating, I mean very
debased people.

20:20.467 --> 20:27.178
And from one to another it passes, to the
another it passes.

20:27.178 --> 20:31.007
Same thing happens in Sahaja Yoga.

20:31.007 --> 20:36.847
If I told somebody that you are no more a
leader, somebody else is the leader, immediately

20:36.847 --> 20:44.947
that person gets angry, he forgets what good
sahaj has done to him, he just forgets.

20:44.947 --> 20:50.428
If I tell him the leadership should pass to
somebody else, finished!

20:50.428 --> 20:57.397
Then he forgets that whatever good was done
to him, whatever Sahaja Yoga has done for

20:57.397 --> 21:02.618
him, he’s living only because Sahaj has
helped him.

21:02.618 --> 21:06.878
So this leadership goes into the heads of
people.

21:06.878 --> 21:15.238
Sahaja Yoga is not here to make leaders out
of you, no never.

21:15.238 --> 21:24.207
It is just for convenience we have leaders
and if they become inconvenient we have to

21:24.207 --> 21:29.258
change it, that’s all, as simple as that.

21:29.258 --> 21:41.398
But still I find this idea of authority is
something very great and they start using

21:41.398 --> 21:48.797
it left and right, everywhere it is happening
practically in every country, has happened

21:48.797 --> 21:58.338
and still happening
which is a very sad thing.

21:58.338 --> 22:03.868
This will never bring forth my efforts.

22:03.868 --> 22:12.098
My effort is to synthesise the whole, not
to divide, by no chance to divide.

22:12.098 --> 22:25.278
Only thing, whatever is wrong, whatever is
unholy has to be brought to your notice.

22:25.278 --> 22:33.287
See as a housewife, when we clean the rice,
there are some white stones in it, we take

22:33.287 --> 22:34.618
them out.

22:34.618 --> 22:38.287
We don’t cook rice with that stone, do we?

22:38.287 --> 22:40.787
And such stones have to go out.

22:40.787 --> 22:44.648
So some of them are just like stones.

22:44.648 --> 22:47.427
You cannot change them.

22:47.427 --> 22:55.898
Namadeva has said that they are like a fly,
who when lives gives us trouble by coming

22:55.898 --> 23:05.628
on our food and by making us feel nauseated
and if by mistake we take her inside in our

23:05.628 --> 23:11.287
stomach, she is dead but still she troubles
us.

23:11.287 --> 23:14.588
These are all rakshasas, I should say.

23:14.588 --> 23:20.817
They can never understand Sahaja Yoga and
they will always try to trouble us.

23:20.817 --> 23:28.588
But what must the people who have achieved
Sahaja Yoga should do.

23:28.588 --> 23:37.667
Should they also take to such methods?

23:37.667 --> 23:43.008
I have never blamed anyone for anything.

23:43.008 --> 23:47.908
Like, people say, “Mother he didn’t give
any money to Sahaja Yoga so he has lost all

23:47.908 --> 23:48.908
his money.”

23:48.908 --> 23:52.927
I never say like that “He should have donated
some money!”

23:52.927 --> 23:55.618
I never ask for donations, I never ask for
money.

23:55.618 --> 23:59.118
Every time I say it’s all sufficient.

23:59.118 --> 24:00.118
Don’t need.

24:00.118 --> 24:14.187
I have never asked for a single pie from anyone
to be given to me even when I needed

24:14.187 --> 24:24.638
because I know I don’t have that problem.

24:24.638 --> 24:27.787
From the life of Christ one has to understand.

24:27.787 --> 24:30.528
He had no problems.

24:30.528 --> 24:33.348
He was fearless.

24:33.348 --> 24:36.108
He knew he was the son of God.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.197
He had no problems at all.

24:38.197 --> 24:43.968
He faced everything, even his crucifixion.

24:43.968 --> 24:49.108
And people, I think, liked his crucifixion
or what?

24:49.108 --> 24:52.358
They carry the cross.

24:52.358 --> 25:07.358
Of course is the transformed symbol of Swastika
no doubt but still.

25:07.358 --> 25:14.578
He had to sacrifice his life.

25:14.578 --> 25:26.848
He sacrificed his life for all the human being
not for only white or black, brown or blue

25:26.848 --> 25:37.868
but he sacrificed his life for all of us so
that we could cross over our agnya.

25:37.868 --> 25:45.358
The condemnation we should do is not of others
but of ourselves.

25:45.358 --> 25:55.478
We can call that as a crucifixion of ours
by which we see as Sahaja Yogis where are

25:55.478 --> 25:56.478
we going.

25:56.478 --> 26:02.798
I’m told there are some 80-90 Sahaja Yogis
who have come, who were mesmerised by some

26:02.798 --> 26:03.798
people.

26:03.798 --> 26:09.158
How could Sahaja Yogis be mesmerised?

26:09.158 --> 26:15.248
Is it possible?

26:15.248 --> 26:25.297
They never must be praying, they may not be
doing meditation.

26:25.297 --> 26:28.728
How can they get into it?

26:28.728 --> 26:33.557
And now they are asking for forgiveness.

26:33.557 --> 26:37.978
I forgive but that doesn’t mean they will
be alright.

26:37.978 --> 26:42.908
We cannot fix them anymore.

26:42.908 --> 26:48.638
We do not put spoiled apples with the good
ones, do we?

26:48.638 --> 26:51.028
This [is] no wisdom.

26:51.028 --> 26:56.328
They are already spoiled, and they should
keep out till I say.

26:56.328 --> 27:02.167
They should not attend any centre, they should
not come to any puja.

27:02.167 --> 27:04.118
They should let them cleanse themselves.

27:04.118 --> 27:11.057
Though a rotten apple cannot get well they
can.

27:11.057 --> 27:16.998
They should try to understand that they were
not Sahaja Yogis.

27:16.998 --> 27:26.667
If a Sahaja Yogi can get mesmerised, then
what’s the use of doing Sahaja Yoga.

27:26.667 --> 27:34.978
What’s the use of getting your Kundalini
raised?

27:34.978 --> 27:42.848
That means that they are very poor Sahaja
Yogis.

27:42.848 --> 27:52.388
Surprisingly I have not seen this kind of
a phenomena in the west, very surprising!

27:52.388 --> 27:59.317
Western Sahaja Yogis, whatever they were,
they are great Sahaja Yogis, I must say if

27:59.317 --> 28:05.858
you consider the number of good people there.

28:05.858 --> 28:10.368
They have given up so-called Christianity,
they have given up all this nonsense, drinking,

28:10.368 --> 28:16.657
drugs, womanising, everything they have given
up.

28:16.657 --> 28:25.407
And I haven’t met one person who has taken
to drinking again or who has taken even to

28:25.407 --> 28:27.498
smoking.

28:27.498 --> 28:33.598
This Yoga bhoomi of yours, which is India.

28:33.598 --> 28:36.787
How could it happen here?

28:36.787 --> 28:39.628
Specially in Maharashtra.

28:39.628 --> 28:46.937
I think some devilish people are born in this
Maharashtra all the time because how is it

28:46.937 --> 28:55.708
they tortured each and every saint?

28:55.708 --> 29:02.858
How?

29:02.858 --> 29:12.128
How is it, they have been so much enticed
by somebody who is saying something which

29:12.128 --> 29:19.388
I have never said?

29:19.388 --> 29:29.958
Shows a very low type of people, very low.

29:29.958 --> 29:38.768
And they must have been always being born
in this Maharashtra, I am sure and again they

29:38.768 --> 29:46.798
are born today.

29:46.798 --> 29:55.388
I never wanted to talk about this at the jubilant
time like this when Christ was born.

29:55.388 --> 30:02.478
Yes, it’s a thing of jubilation because
He came as a Saviour.

30:02.478 --> 30:06.758
He did everything that is possible under the
sun.

30:06.758 --> 30:19.258
For us it’s alright but what about Him,
what did we give Him?

30:19.258 --> 30:24.958
In the same way many Sahaja Yogis go on demanding,
Mother we can’t even meet you, we can’t

30:24.958 --> 30:30.677
even shake hands with you, we can’t even
fall at your feet.

30:30.677 --> 30:34.728
We can’t do this, we can’t do that.

30:34.728 --> 30:36.197
It surprises me.

30:36.197 --> 30:41.098
“You must do this, You must do that.”

30:41.098 --> 30:47.028
All the time lecturing to me.

30:47.028 --> 30:50.537
What you must do?

30:50.537 --> 31:01.168
You must do, is to meditate and to believe
that this Paramchaitanya is My power and that

31:01.168 --> 31:04.697
you have felt My power within you.

31:04.697 --> 31:08.988
The more you are away from you the better
you will be.

31:08.988 --> 31:21.317
Absolutely, I can’t understand the demanding
nature of some Sahaja Yogis.

31:21.317 --> 31:31.348
They have got their Jagruti (awakening of
Kundalini) which would never have happened.

31:31.348 --> 31:37.128
If Christ wanted, He would have killed all
of them and lived very well, but I think He

31:37.128 --> 31:53.858
must have been fed up with the stupidity all
around.

31:53.858 --> 32:03.138
So at this time, we have to understand that
such a great Incarnation came on this earth.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.818
Of course he couldn’t give Realisation.

32:05.818 --> 32:10.897
Imagine the people who were about to crucify
Him, how could he give realisation?

32:10.897 --> 32:18.478
Supposing somebody comes with the dagger at
Me, can I give them realisation?

32:18.478 --> 32:22.047
It’s all right.

32:22.047 --> 32:25.738
Nobody listened to Them, nobody thought anything
of them but not you!

32:25.738 --> 32:28.648
You people have got your realisation.

32:28.648 --> 32:30.208
You are born again people.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.067
You are great people.

32:32.067 --> 32:33.638
Your potential is there.

32:33.638 --> 32:39.377
Instead of utilising that now, what are you
doing?

32:39.377 --> 32:44.557
How many people are really involved in Sahaja
Yoga?

32:44.557 --> 32:45.557
Introspect.

32:45.557 --> 32:49.738
They have their own business, they have their
own this thing, they have – How many are

32:49.738 --> 32:52.408
really involved in Sahaja Yoga?

32:52.408 --> 33:03.807
He had only twelve disciples, except for one
or two, all of them dedicated without realisation,

33:03.807 --> 33:11.147
dedicated fully to the work of Christianity
and which spread because they had not much

33:11.147 --> 33:13.858
idea about the whole thing.

33:13.858 --> 33:22.268
The Christians that they had were just converts,
useless people

33:22.268 --> 33:29.028
and I would say that if they did not do any
justice to the birth of Christ, one can understand.

33:29.028 --> 33:33.578
But what about you people?

33:33.578 --> 33:47.388
Who are born twice, who have got their self
Knowledge, who are so equipped with all the

33:47.388 --> 33:58.797
powers, who are connected with this all power,
what you can call the power of Divine Love?

33:58.797 --> 34:10.328
All your powers can be utilised, can be known.

34:10.328 --> 34:16.378
It’s like some dynamic machine which has
started.

34:16.378 --> 34:29.187
Few wheels are moving but there are so many
wheels after wheels and so much you can do.

34:29.187 --> 34:36.248
I cannot blame the Christians who are so stupid
because after all they never got their awakening.

34:36.248 --> 34:44.047
Only some priest would bring some water, put
it on their head and baptised them, finished.

34:44.047 --> 34:48.547
But what about you people?

34:48.547 --> 34:54.078
I have lived because of you, because I wanted
to see that you people mature.

34:54.078 --> 35:00.058
That’s the idea of the Mother is.

35:00.058 --> 35:08.218
There are many who are matured, I would not
say, but still many have to be matured.

35:08.218 --> 35:14.067
Doesn’t mean that you should be able to
give big lectures, or write books or anything.

35:14.067 --> 35:17.027
But within yourself you should mature.

35:17.027 --> 35:35.567
Your own personality should flower into the
fragrance of love of divinity.

35:35.567 --> 35:39.628
This is what I would say is the difference
between Me and Christ.

35:39.628 --> 35:44.208
He said “Baba I had enough, No, No, No more!

35:44.208 --> 35:48.458
With these stupid people.”

35:48.458 --> 35:52.437
Not Me, I knew what was the world like.

35:52.437 --> 35:55.098
I knew what had happened to this world.

35:55.098 --> 36:01.708
Today the world is much worse, because all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

36:01.708 --> 36:03.088
firstly.

36:03.088 --> 36:10.968
All the politicians are trying to be very
badly corrupt, competing in that corruption.

36:10.968 --> 36:16.938
Nobody has sense of truth and honesty.

36:16.938 --> 36:28.358
Everybody is involved in the advertisement,
newspapers, media, this, that, which is the

36:28.358 --> 36:31.098
most corrupting influence today.

36:31.098 --> 36:42.628
With all this background, I know by the year
2000, Sahaja Yoga will come out in the whole

36:42.628 --> 36:55.387
world as something very great…(applause)
– You did not allow me to complete the sentence

36:55.387 --> 37:01.258
– if you people become real Sahaja Yogis.

37:01.258 --> 37:02.338
All of you.

37:02.338 --> 37:08.437
All of you who are attending to Me here.

37:08.437 --> 37:12.148
Even this much group if it becomes real Sahaja
Yogis.

37:12.148 --> 37:16.427
It doesn’t matter if I cannot meet you personally.

37:16.427 --> 37:19.758
It doesn’t matter if I cannot go to your
places.

37:19.758 --> 37:22.657
It doesn’t matter, nothing matters.

37:22.657 --> 37:29.238
Christ’s disciples worked when he never
existed.

37:29.238 --> 37:37.848
So it’s not important, what is important
is that you are the people who are responsible

37:37.848 --> 37:43.708
for the emancipation of this world, for the
synthesis of this world, to bring peace and

37:43.708 --> 37:46.468
joy and happiness to people.

37:46.468 --> 37:52.937
Just now when I was coming, people spread
the shawls.

37:52.937 --> 38:02.358
It reminded Me of Christ when he came, they
brought palms leaves to wish him and spread

38:02.358 --> 38:06.628
their shawls on the ground for him to go,
and where does he go?

38:06.628 --> 38:07.628
To Gallows.

38:07.628 --> 38:15.908
He goes to cross, he goes for his death.

38:15.908 --> 38:24.328
When you show your love for Me, you have to
know that you have to love the whole work

38:24.328 --> 38:25.608
of Sahaja Yoga.

38:25.608 --> 38:33.128
It’s not some personal relationship with
Me that is going to work out.

38:33.128 --> 38:37.668
All these western countries in the influence
of Christianity will go down, you will see.

38:37.668 --> 38:40.968
They are going down already because there’s
is no morality.

38:40.968 --> 38:47.958
There’s recession, all kinds of problems,
their children are wavered, they are drinking,

38:47.958 --> 38:50.158
smoking, doing all kinds of things.

38:50.158 --> 38:53.458
Even their influence on us is corrupting us.

38:53.458 --> 38:56.698
Antichrist activity, throughout if you find.

38:56.698 --> 38:59.338
It’s nothing but antichrist activity.

38:59.338 --> 39:03.488
Who is the Antichrist?

39:03.488 --> 39:08.268
They are describing he is the antichrist,
that fellow is the Antichrist.

39:08.268 --> 39:09.638
That’s not the thing.

39:09.638 --> 39:19.508
There is an antichrist within us, who accepts
all these things which are against the purity

39:19.508 --> 39:24.878
and love of Christ.

39:24.878 --> 39:29.418
So first of all among yourselves.

39:29.418 --> 39:32.938
What is he going?

39:32.938 --> 39:35.708
Sit down!

39:35.708 --> 39:42.068
You must teach your children some manners.

39:42.068 --> 39:47.238
This girl who was drowned is because you neglected
the child.

39:47.238 --> 39:48.428
The father, where was he?

39:48.428 --> 39:49.428
I don’t know.

39:49.428 --> 39:55.568
I can’t understand how can a child be left
like that.

39:55.568 --> 40:05.558
It’s important to discipline your children.

40:05.558 --> 40:10.788
…if you have a neighbour, you’ve had it.

40:10.788 --> 40:17.769
He will try to find out where you go, what
you do.

40:17.769 --> 40:27.248
He will have a binocular to see and you make
any noise, you are finished but even if you

40:27.248 --> 40:31.128
sing, you are finished.

40:31.128 --> 40:32.698
In that way, Indians are better.

40:32.698 --> 40:36.588
They don’t have that noise difficulty.

40:36.588 --> 40:38.028
We don’t have.

40:38.028 --> 40:39.368
Indians can live in the noise.

40:39.368 --> 40:44.868
I wanted to find out why Indians are so adjustable
to noise.

40:44.868 --> 40:47.758
They don’t mind noise.

40:47.758 --> 40:56.508
I found out the reason is that in the west
people are under stress and strain and that’s

40:56.508 --> 40:58.178
why they can’t bear.

40:58.178 --> 41:03.058
But in India, people don’t know what is
stress and strain is.

41:03.058 --> 41:08.590
Still that has not developed, I don’t know
how to that extent.

41:08.590 --> 41:10.678
That disease has not come.

41:10.678 --> 41:16.798
That might be the reason that they are so
much frightened of noises.

41:16.798 --> 41:19.228
People will come from villages here.

41:19.228 --> 41:23.828
They’ll sleep on the station, nothing happens.

41:23.828 --> 41:29.678
The trains are coming and going, nicely sleeping.

41:29.678 --> 41:37.008
Imagine in the west, thank God, in Italy we
have neighbours little far away, we had a

41:37.008 --> 41:38.008
little trouble.

41:38.008 --> 41:43.148
But in England, we had to go on changing our
ashram from one place to another, run away

41:43.148 --> 41:48.098
from here to there, because of great neighbours,
we had one of them had the name Mr Peace.

41:48.098 --> 41:53.748
I don’t know who gave him that name.

41:53.748 --> 41:56.978
Such contradictions in life.

41:56.978 --> 41:59.528
Such horrible contradictions.

41:59.528 --> 42:10.008
I don’t know how will they learn how to
love their neighbour.

42:10.008 --> 42:12.658
But Indians do.

42:12.658 --> 42:18.218
Somehow they don’t have this problem, not
much.

42:18.218 --> 42:20.038
Sometimes they have but not so much.

42:20.038 --> 42:29.988
But if there is a music supposing, all the
neighbours will join, bring tea, bring this,

42:29.988 --> 42:34.238
they’ll be enjoying the music.

42:34.238 --> 42:40.198
But there the collectivity is so little I
think, I can’t understand how can they call

42:40.198 --> 42:41.578
themselves Christians.

42:41.578 --> 42:52.778
Only they go to church, well dressed and our
Mayor told Me that for fifteen minutes hardly

42:52.778 --> 42:54.528
we can sit.

42:54.528 --> 42:57.688
We start looking at the watches.

42:57.688 --> 42:59.038
Fifteen minutes.

42:59.038 --> 43:07.758
And after half an hour, we all run out of
the jail and how is it these people are sitting

43:07.758 --> 43:09.658
with you for hours together.

43:09.658 --> 43:16.988
I said, I must be mesmerising them.

43:16.988 --> 43:22.798
I mean they are not so collective, unless
and until they drink, they cannot be collective.

43:22.798 --> 43:27.408
Unless and until they get intoxicated, they
cannot talk to each other.

43:27.408 --> 43:31.628
They are all the time tired.

43:31.628 --> 43:33.338
They are supposed to be Christians.

43:33.338 --> 43:42.338
They are so tired, you see them in the films
or anywhere, they come and sit down “hah!”.

43:42.338 --> 43:44.338
What has happened?

43:44.338 --> 43:46.328
Young people.

43:46.328 --> 43:51.138
All the time thinking, thinking, thinking,
which comes from Agya.

43:51.138 --> 44:00.668
Which comes from anti-Christ activity!

44:00.668 --> 44:02.758
Anti-Christ activity, thinking, thinking,
thinking.

44:02.758 --> 44:05.298
What should we do tomorrow?

44:05.298 --> 44:09.418
What is to be done and all that.

44:09.418 --> 44:23.298
Still we have to hope that this kind of religion
will finish.

44:23.298 --> 44:26.198
All such religions must finish.

44:26.198 --> 44:28.468
They have to go now, it’s too much.

44:28.468 --> 44:34.168
you cannot support them.

44:34.168 --> 44:42.048
They are so much full of anti-religious temperament
that you just can’t bear them.

44:42.048 --> 44:53.878
Better to finish Islam, Hinduism, Christianity,
Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, all isms one after

44:53.878 --> 44:57.678
another.

44:57.678 --> 45:00.858
To what religion did Christ belong?

45:00.858 --> 45:06.158
I don’t know.

45:06.158 --> 45:10.578
You belong to one religion which is Sahaj.

45:10.578 --> 45:15.238
Which is the universal religion, which is
the pure religion, which is born within you.

45:15.238 --> 45:24.378
You don’t belong to any other religion because
there is no religion in that.

45:24.378 --> 45:42.188
So by the time 2000 years, I hope all these
religions will run away from this earth.

45:42.188 --> 45:46.978
(applause).

45:46.978 --> 45:57.868
All of them fighting for nothing at all, killing
each other for nothing at all.

45:57.868 --> 46:02.458
They want, they want to fight, they like to
fight.

46:02.458 --> 46:09.418
Why blame Koran, why blame Bible, why blame
Christ, why blame anyone.

46:09.418 --> 46:10.728
They want to fight.

46:10.728 --> 46:14.128
They are of divisive nature.

46:14.128 --> 46:20.278
They want to have separate nations, separate
communities, separate this.

46:20.278 --> 46:26.048
Once you start separating you are antichrist.

46:26.048 --> 46:27.368
Absolutely.

46:27.368 --> 46:41.338
In Sahaja Yoga also I say that you are one
identity, you are not separate country, separate

46:41.338 --> 46:49.228
organisation, separate this, doesn’t exist
in my own idea.

46:49.228 --> 46:50.948
Doesn’t exist.

46:50.948 --> 46:56.078
I never thought of it.

46:56.078 --> 47:02.528
We are all children of one Father and of one
Mother.

47:02.528 --> 47:06.838
We have no business to think we are separate.

47:06.838 --> 47:10.748
Even now, I have seen groups are made very
easily.

47:10.748 --> 47:11.748
How?

47:11.748 --> 47:18.578
The groups are made.

47:18.578 --> 47:33.418
Like I find Maharashtrians

47:33.418 --> 47:42.028
are sitting together (Mother talks briefly
in Marathi.)

47:42.028 --> 47:49.728
Then we have group of the North Indians.

47:49.728 --> 47:56.318
Indians are quite separatist I tell you, somehow,
by temperament.

47:56.318 --> 48:02.698
North Indians also have separate separate
ideas.

48:02.698 --> 48:05.838
“You must come to Indore.”

48:05.838 --> 48:08.678
Why?

48:08.678 --> 48:10.558
Is it not a part of India?

48:10.558 --> 48:13.998
They can’t come to Delhi?

48:13.998 --> 48:18.998
“You must come to Kanpur, You must come
to Allahabad, you must come to Indore.”

48:18.998 --> 48:23.858
You must go to every village, every place.

48:23.858 --> 48:24.908
Why?

48:24.908 --> 48:38.388
You are born today in Delhi, tomorrow you
will be born in some horrid place, then, “This

48:38.388 --> 48:41.678
place is mine.

48:41.678 --> 48:43.938
This is my house..must come to my house.”

48:43.938 --> 48:45.298
That’s another headache.

48:45.298 --> 48:46.818
“You must come to my house.”

48:46.818 --> 48:51.478
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

48:51.478 --> 49:05.308
Once you start that, you are finished, you
are no more belonging to Christ, no more.

49:05.308 --> 49:11.649
This is a very, very common programme – even
today that, if you see around yourself, must

49:11.649 --> 49:15.978
be people from your own country.

49:15.978 --> 49:23.458
Just see around yourself, are you sitting
with another people?

49:23.458 --> 49:24.998
Who is the other?

49:24.998 --> 49:29.568
In Sahaja Yoga, who is the other?

49:29.568 --> 49:43.568
We are all one and this unity we have to learn,
if you really love Me and Christ.

49:43.568 --> 49:50.698
All this groupism and all this has to end
now among Sahaja Yogis, must end.

49:50.698 --> 49:59.718
We are all one identity, we are all one living
body.

49:59.718 --> 50:02.888
We are all one living organism.

50:02.888 --> 50:07.058
We cannot say we are separate.

50:07.058 --> 50:16.508
Can this hand separate from the body, can
it exist?

50:16.508 --> 50:23.948
Once you start giving it up, you will be surprised,
you will have real enjoyment.

50:23.948 --> 50:35.118
But once you have all these ideas about my,
my, you can’t even enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

50:35.118 --> 50:47.238
Cannot enjoy anybody else – “my wife,
my children, my house”, my this, my that.

50:47.238 --> 50:51.428
That awakening has to come within.

50:51.428 --> 50:55.468
“I don’t belong to this country.”

50:55.468 --> 51:01.668
Many girls you see and boys have written,
“We’ll have Indian marriage.”

51:01.668 --> 51:06.758
Only the age of the woman is 35 years.

51:06.758 --> 51:07.758
Only!

51:07.758 --> 51:16.518
Now where will I find a husband for her in
India, must be some widower or somebody.

51:16.518 --> 51:18.338
Must have an Indian marriage!

51:18.338 --> 51:22.848
Can you beat that?

51:22.848 --> 51:25.728
Such people, is impossible to marry them.

51:25.728 --> 51:31.188
I give you choice, all right have a choice.

51:31.188 --> 51:39.098
I also have a choice – I can’t marry you!

51:39.098 --> 51:41.698
That is My choice!

51:41.698 --> 51:46.358
You have the freedom to say where you want
to marry – alright marry.

51:46.358 --> 51:52.068
But as far as I am concerned, I can’t marry
you like that.

51:52.068 --> 52:01.078
You have to marry wherever there is a good
match for you.

52:01.078 --> 52:07.438
Many Indian girls have married with Indians
boys, and have suffered a lot, such a lot,

52:07.438 --> 52:16.048
you won’t believe! (talks in Hindi briefly).

52:16.048 --> 52:18.858
Not in Sahaja Yoga any more!

52:18.858 --> 52:26.668
We have not been able to organise even one
marriage of a Hindustani with an Hindustani

52:26.668 --> 52:29.448
– not possible.

52:29.448 --> 52:34.108
That’s not the desire of the Divine.

52:34.108 --> 52:45.268
Why don’t you find in your own community
somewhere [the] same thing.

52:45.268 --> 52:47.668
As in India, is very particular.

52:47.668 --> 52:51.358
Very very particular.

52:51.358 --> 52:54.578
Like when my daughter was to be married, they
said “No!

52:54.578 --> 52:56.958
He his not a Shrivastava.

52:56.958 --> 53:02.048
If he is a Shrivastava also, he is not the
same Shrivastava.

53:02.048 --> 53:05.358
Even if he is the same Shrivastava, his this
thing is different!”

53:05.358 --> 53:06.358
I mean.

53:06.358 --> 53:07.958
I said, “Now this is going to finish”.

53:07.958 --> 53:14.218
Because I had all my elders living and they
were after me.

53:14.218 --> 53:20.188
I said “Whether he is a Shrivastava or not
Shrivastava I am going to marry them, finished!”

53:20.188 --> 53:22.908
My husband agreed.

53:22.908 --> 53:27.968
Same with my grandchildren.

53:27.968 --> 53:31.028
If you get Shrivastava, well and good, otherwise
forget it.

53:31.028 --> 53:33.618
Maharashtrians also same.

53:33.618 --> 53:42.688
Maharashtrians who have become Christians
[are] also the same, you be amazed, Christians!

53:42.688 --> 53:50.138
Now they are saying we are Dalit Christians,
means who were converted from the lower caste

53:50.138 --> 53:51.378
into Christianity.

53:51.378 --> 53:52.378
Now there is a new caste that’s come.

53:52.378 --> 53:57.598
Once you have become Christian, what is your
caste?

53:57.598 --> 54:01.178
You are Christian, not that.

54:01.178 --> 54:03.408
They are Dalits and they are higher Christians.

54:03.408 --> 54:11.438
They will not marry in the Dalit and Dalit
won’t marry in the higher.

54:11.438 --> 54:21.568
Supposed to be Christians, following Christ,
going to church regularly, well dressed.

54:21.568 --> 54:23.888
Even if they do not have a proper suit.

54:23.888 --> 54:29.388
They must wear like English some suit, borrow
it, and go to church because according to

54:29.388 --> 54:33.798
Indian Christians, Christ was born in England.

54:33.798 --> 54:39.458
(laughter) Really, you won’t believe.

54:39.458 --> 54:43.638
Unless and until you wear a suit and a tie,
you can’t go to the Church.

54:43.638 --> 54:55.848
Can you imagine, anybody, going with a dhoti
to church? (more laughter) Impossible situation.

54:55.848 --> 55:04.198
Even in my time, thank God I didn’t marry
a Christian, but my own sisters and all were

55:04.198 --> 55:08.908
forced to wear veils and not the saris, wear
the frocks and the veils.

55:08.908 --> 55:13.748
Can you imagine the wedding dress.

55:13.748 --> 55:17.328
We, Indian women, can’t do without the saris.

55:17.328 --> 55:19.488
But they were forced.

55:19.488 --> 55:23.258
So many women married the way English marry.

55:23.258 --> 55:30.598
And I was amazed even the Japanese who are
Christians come to Australia and dress up

55:30.598 --> 55:41.138
like these English brides and get married
– because they are Christians.

55:41.138 --> 55:46.728
That shows that they believe that Christ was
born in England or what?

55:46.728 --> 55:57.118
Actually, for Christians it’s not necessary
to worry about any dress.

55:57.118 --> 56:03.588
All this nonsense comes from the West that
you must dress up like this, you must have

56:03.588 --> 56:05.928
your spoon here, fork here.

56:05.928 --> 56:14.248
Did Christ eat with fork and spoon?

56:14.248 --> 56:18.128
He was born in the manger.

56:18.128 --> 56:23.868
It’s impossible to understand these people
are Christians.

56:23.868 --> 56:28.488
So much worried about the spoons and forks
and they came to your house for dinner, they

56:28.488 --> 56:33.678
lift the plate to see from what company you
have bought it.

56:33.678 --> 56:35.588
[That’s] very important!

56:35.588 --> 56:37.508
Such silly people!

56:37.508 --> 56:42.278
I tell you they call themselves Christians.

56:42.278 --> 56:50.388
Christ was born in the manger and [they are]
so particular about nonsensical things.

56:50.388 --> 57:00.748
You see one must understand the greatness
of His birth, in which he has shown that he

57:00.748 --> 57:05.828
was born with the cows tied there and the
calves were there.

57:05.828 --> 57:14.318
He was born in the manger.

57:14.318 --> 57:20.948
Not only the Christians abroad but they are
also in India the same – you can make out

57:20.948 --> 57:22.488
a Christian in no time.

57:22.488 --> 57:30.588
See them on a Sunday morning.

57:30.588 --> 57:39.768
That way my father opposed it – he used
to wear kurta, because Christ wore kurta.

57:39.768 --> 57:45.848
He didn’t wear suit, did he?

57:45.848 --> 57:47.868
And so superficial they are.

57:47.868 --> 57:50.458
Nothing to learn from them.

57:50.458 --> 57:59.478
They will put here on top [a label written]
“Saville Row”, On top of the suit!!

57:59.478 --> 58:07.948
Such stupid people, I tell you, and the Indians
are following them left and right, I can’t

58:07.948 --> 58:09.168
understand.

58:09.168 --> 58:10.208
They are anti-Christ.

58:10.208 --> 58:15.048
Don’t follow them on these points.

58:15.048 --> 58:22.188
Indians have at least certain sense of dignity.

58:22.188 --> 58:32.128
If you have any, why should you wear a suit
on a May day here?

58:32.128 --> 58:33.598
In this heat?

58:33.598 --> 58:36.418
We are Sahaja Yogis.

58:36.418 --> 58:41.078
We have to wear a common dress of a common
man.

58:41.078 --> 58:48.768
Whom are we going to impress except for this
Paramchaitanya?

58:48.768 --> 59:01.378
They are extremely superficial extremely meticulously
particular about their dress, how they live

59:01.378 --> 59:04.978
and it’s really horrible.

59:04.978 --> 59:13.108
I have seen this and that is the reason I
think I should warn you.

59:13.108 --> 59:19.978
Don’t take to that culture, that is anti-Christ
culture.

59:19.978 --> 59:28.448
Absolutely anti-Christ in every way.

59:28.448 --> 59:36.118
In every way they have insulted Christ out
and out.

59:36.118 --> 59:41.148
You people should not anymore insult Christ.

59:41.148 --> 59:43.138
In a simple way you live.

59:43.138 --> 59:51.638
I mean now this sari, they forced me to wear
is like a big bag for Me but what to do.

59:51.638 --> 59:54.368
Yesterday also they forced Me, today also
they forced me.

59:54.368 --> 59:58.988
I am supposed to wear all this because I am
Adi Shakti, supposed to be.

59:58.988 --> 01:00:09.068
If I was Christ, I would have been better
off.

01:00:09.068 --> 01:00:11.968
He was much more free than Me!

01:00:11.968 --> 01:00:20.468
Now, with all this what we have to know, what
is the message?

01:00:20.468 --> 01:00:27.818
What is the message of Christ?

01:00:27.818 --> 01:00:36.238
That you develop your spirituality, your divinity
by which you know what is the dignity of a

01:00:36.238 --> 01:00:37.598
Sahaja Yogi is.

01:00:37.598 --> 01:00:44.498
He was your eldest brother I should say.

01:00:44.498 --> 01:00:48.308
His lifestyle you should follow.

01:00:48.308 --> 01:00:54.258
Absolutely not afraid of anything, not worried
about any job, nothing, not worried about

01:00:54.258 --> 01:01:02.948
any business anything, absolutely free from
all worries.

01:01:02.948 --> 01:01:11.088
So many examples we have, beautiful examples
of his life, but when we see Christians, we

01:01:11.088 --> 01:01:23.928
try to reflect it as an expression of the
life of Christ and that is where we make mistake.

01:01:23.928 --> 01:01:35.818
They are, by no means they are for Christ,
they are, by no means, following Christ.

01:01:35.818 --> 01:01:41.328
So as Sahaja Yogis, we have a different culture.

01:01:41.328 --> 01:01:44.218
We have a culture where we respect morality.

01:01:44.218 --> 01:01:48.618
We have dignity, we have our own personality.

01:01:48.618 --> 01:01:58.118
We are fearless, we don’t tell lies, we
don’t cheat and we can never get mesmerised.

01:01:58.118 --> 01:02:11.868
So we have to have, now we can call it “the
Mother’s culture”, and which is not in

01:02:11.868 --> 01:02:18.908
any way showing off, or in any way taking
to artificial things.

01:02:18.908 --> 01:02:26.179
The whole thing will change, the whole concept
will change, whole idea will change, once

01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:37.558
you understand that you are now in “the
Mother’s culture”.

01:02:37.558 --> 01:02:39.628
Now they have forced me, so I am wearing all
right.

01:02:39.628 --> 01:02:43.388
You want me to wear, alright I’ll wear.

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:51.468
But normally if you leave it to Me what do
I wear, you know that.

01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:55.288
Secret is out already!

01:02:55.288 --> 01:03:00.558
If you want to give me presents, give me,
I never asked you for presents, nothing!

01:03:00.558 --> 01:03:02.418
Forcing the presents on my head!

01:03:02.418 --> 01:03:05.548
Alright, for your joy’s sake you have it.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.218
What to do?

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:10.918
But one thing I must request these Maharashtrians.

01:03:10.918 --> 01:03:19.818
They are not going to give me anymore, anymore,
again anymore what they call is the oti part.

01:03:19.818 --> 01:03:23.728
My oti is overfull.

01:03:23.728 --> 01:03:28.558
Absolutely, nobody has to give me oti.

01:03:28.558 --> 01:03:34.478
If somebody gets married, if somebody has
a child, somebody has anything, they’ll

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.588
bring the oti.

01:03:36.588 --> 01:03:42.018
There is no need to give me any oti, you can
go to the temple, you give your oti there

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:49.848
it is resold and resold and resold in between
the sellers who are Gujaratis, the brahmins

01:03:49.848 --> 01:03:55.808
who are the pujaris make money.

01:03:55.808 --> 01:04:03.208
So no more oti, nobody is going to give Me
any oti whatsoever.

01:04:03.208 --> 01:04:15.368
On a Christmas day I have to say one thing
– what did we give to Christ.

01:04:15.368 --> 01:04:21.958
And the second question what are we going
to give to Mother.

01:04:21.958 --> 01:04:24.198
This is very important.

01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:32.158
I don’t want anything from you, nothing.

01:04:32.158 --> 01:04:35.918
I am fully content with Myself.

01:04:35.918 --> 01:04:43.638
What I want is that you must dedicate yourself
to Sahaja Yoga, to truth and to love.

01:04:43.638 --> 01:04:59.468
I will be very happy and also not to talk
like, what you call, Christ has called them,

01:04:59.468 --> 01:05:04.188
“murmuring souls” – talking here there,
one saying there.

01:05:04.188 --> 01:05:07.438
All this.I don’t like at all.

01:05:07.438 --> 01:05:09.038
I don’t like it and it should not be done.

01:05:09.038 --> 01:05:13.118
If you do like this, you will fall, fall very
badly.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.958
This is the last judgement.

01:05:14.958 --> 01:05:19.898
Either you‘ll go to heaven or you‘ll go
to hell.

01:05:19.898 --> 01:05:22.728
It’s already working out like that.

01:05:22.728 --> 01:05:25.508
So let’s see.

01:05:25.508 --> 01:05:28.288
Where are you?

01:05:28.288 --> 01:05:34.138
So I have to again and again tell you as your
mother, I have to correct you and tell you

01:05:34.138 --> 01:05:45.848
that remember this is the last judgement and
please, do not take anymore to the activities

01:05:45.848 --> 01:05:49.608
which are anti-Christ.

01:05:49.608 --> 01:05:56.278
You can judge within yourself – [whether]
whatever you are doing is not good, and for

01:05:56.278 --> 01:05:59.808
that, best thing is to dedicate yourself to
Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:59.808 --> 01:06:03.868
But not to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:03.868 --> 01:06:07.208
Not to make politics out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:16.318
But make Sahaja Yoga like a big, huge, big
tree and it will work out.

01:06:16.318 --> 01:06:19.028
I know it will work out.

01:06:19.028 --> 01:06:20.288
You have the potential.

01:06:20.288 --> 01:06:21.878
That’s why you are here.

01:06:24.158 --> 01:06:27.688
May God bless you all
