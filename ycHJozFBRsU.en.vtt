00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.420
That time I used to be so happy that you people all have joined together, the collectivity is good

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.740
and that you are helping the leader, who is very capable, I must say,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.320
you are so lucky to have such a leader who is so capable, educated, wise and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.000
I can't understand how people do not enjoy his leadership.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.120
If you have any problems, tell Me - no harm. You see, from Australia I get

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.840
such thick letters always [UNCLEAR - WHEN THEY WRITE?] but the main thing they never write.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.120
Like, I never wanted them to go to America

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.660
because America is a Hell, you see. I didn't want them, they'll lose their vibrations - I mean, it's not a place to go to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.800
and without asking Me they all went. Otherwise for a small thing like putting a WC somewhere, they'll write to Me

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.140
but for going to America no body wrote, I never knew, I was surprised to see

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.800
thirty five people coming on top of these few four, five sahaja yogis there.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.180
And the way they talked to these people also shocked [ASIDE - Paani Dena (Give Water)] They are actually

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.560
very, very good sahaja yogis; They are few, very few but one better than the other - wonderful people they are!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.760
And gradually they are spreading sahaja yoga in a very good way. So, they told Me that some of the sahaja yogis who went from America,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.000
they said, "You are not supposed, you see, have a common room for television.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.280
You can have your own television and you can sit in your room. We even cook separately

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.540
but it's supposed to be an ashram," and the Americans were surprised.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.500
They said, "Mother, how can that be?" I said, "Maybe, I can't say, I've not heard of it."

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.020
I asked Steven. Steven said, "I've never heard of such a thing

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.980
that they have a separate room of their own and they cook food there and they have their television,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.960
they don't even talk to each other for days together."

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.980
I said, "This is something Australian style. I don't know how they have got it this in their head."

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.780
So you have to be collective - it's very important. There's nothing to sacrifice. Actually, those

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.240
who try to have separate houses are writing to Me, "Mother, please tell the ashrams to take us back because we are suffering."

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.960
Their wives are pregnant and they can't drive, they can't do anything

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.440
and these are Indians who are good for nothing. They don't know anything to work it out.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.140
They don't know how to cook, they don't know how to even

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.480
have a gardener how - nothing - so they said that, "Mother, we want to go back to the ashram

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.480
because these are useless people here and they are making us do every work

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.320
and now we are pregnant we can't do it so, can't You arrange that we go back?" The ashramites said, "There is no room for them."

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.620
Poor girls are suffering so, no use having separate houses.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.420
The second point was brought out that they all are studying here.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.800
They come for sahaja yoga. Some gentleman is studying for ten years and his wife is earning -

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.780
that's not proper. Studying, he didn't come here to study

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:52.380
and because of studies he has no time for sahaja yoga or anything. He's taking advantage of something so great, so that one should not do. Of course you can study also

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.460
but first thing is sahaja yog. You have come all the way, you have to first of all, spread sahaja yog

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.860
otherwise you'll be failing God, you'll be failing Me and every way it shows

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.600
a very mediocre effort for anything and whatever success you might get also will be very limited

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.300
and will not give you real pleasure while if you're doing sahaja yoga,

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.960
you can achieve a lot even in your studies. I know of a child, whose father was sick, who came to see Me

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.000
and I cured him. When he went back he told his son about his cure so the son started meditating

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.780
and when he was meditating, the son gradually - he was supposed to be a bad student -

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.340
and when he started meditating, you won't believe, he stood first in the whole of U.P. that is,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.100
a, I don't know, how many million people live in that Province; In the whole, in Matriculation.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.020
It has not happened in My family with anybody - I was surprised how this boy could be so highly placed.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.100
We had first class and all that but never the one who can top the whole list of millions of students.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.560
And this boy just, he had never met Me, just meditated - who was supposed to be a bad student - has done so well.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.880
So, your faith in meditation should not be lost, firstly and also correcting yourself

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.400
every time you find something wrong - please be humble about it - try to find out.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.100
Rather worried about these children you see going down there - stream. Is it a very big stream or an ordinary?
- Very small.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.020
- Is it very deep?
- It's not very deep, Mother - Shree Mataji
- Shallow, it's alright.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.200
But somebody should be with them. A little child going that side.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.100
- Can somebody go?
- There's somebody with them.
- Mother, unka parivaar hai.(Their family is with them)
- Go from that side, I think.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.960
- Their mummy is there.
- Unka parivaar hai,[ THEIR FAMILY IS THERE] Shree Mataji.
- Is it their family or our?
- Unka parivaar hai [THEIR FAMILY IS THERE]

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.520
[HINDI - Sab unka nahin kuch apna bhi hai Mere khayal se] Not all theirs, some of ours is also there, I think.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.440
There's a lady with them, haan.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.080
I think, if you all manage your own children, there won't be problem.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.020
Every time I see a child going; Look at that girl.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.480
- Unka parivaar hai?[ Is it their family?]
- Ji Shree Mataji, sab unhi ka hai. Yeh moti waali ja rahin peeche [Yes Shree Mataji, all their family. That fat lady going behind]

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.820
Annh

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.760
The elder brother has to look after the little baby - that's good, that's very good.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.880
So, to come to a very happy note we have to say that

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.480
with all this happening, I'm sure, you all sahaja yogis

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.480
will move very fast

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.640
and develop your sensitivity. This time also another problem came up because

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.920
Baba mama made a very big program for you to come down to India.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.760
Until the last minute nothing had happened and I didn't know what to do also. It was a very, very interesting program.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:48.780
Have you been through the whole program any one of you, annh?[UNCLEAR] you've been through?

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:57.760
How did you enjoy? It's such a nice thing and we got it on a concession also - whole thing -

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:04.820
and people saw tigers and they also saw that river. It was very nice.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.760
You also came to Chhindwara? Good. So with, see, you should understand that

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.480
if you have to come, you should decide beforehand - last minute is a big problem.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.840
And we know exactly how many are coming - I'm just giving you a practical difficulty - but we have to inform

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.080
the Railways, we have to inform the buses, we have to cook,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.880
I mean, everything has to be done - the food and every way. If we don't know how many people are coming, it's very difficult.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:52.080
And you don't have to do anything, you just have to pay money but the rest of the people who have to receive you, the rest of the people

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:59.380
who have to organize everything, it's very difficult. Still I don't know how, this time, we managed everything. I

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.320
was quite apprehensive because we couldn't understand how many were coming, how they'll be arriving;

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:14.240
Some came directly from Bombay to Chhindwara, some came up to only to Poona - they stayed only in Poona.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.560
So all these haphazard things despite uh.. all kinds of miscalculations, it all worked out.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:30.580
But still, it not so good as it should have been because it's better to have a peaceful, proper, thorough

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.420
working out of these outside things so at least, then you are much more peaceful within yourself and to enjoy the whole thing.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:45.920
But all the time if everybody is trying to put you up there and put you up there, it's very difficult.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.460
When you don't have to do anything - is the point - you see, you have to just arrive

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.360
so, it's better that you decide beforehand. But this time I don't know, what has happened about the mess of the whole thing - is the money part and all that.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:09.980
It's very difficult. We've been trying to calculate it and - some people brought the money recently in Calcutta about half the amount

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:18.140
they paid. I mean, this sort of, so, you see, actually what I feel is that

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:24.940
at least you should know what you're going to do, what you want to do. How can it be last minute you decide?

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:30.400
That I can't understand the person. You know, I don't have a secretariat or I don't even have a secretary.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.820
Under these circumstances, you are all people who are the secretaries, you are the ones who are organizing.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.660
It's not that you are just coming there like guests and the rest are just looking after you.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:53.680
This time I would like you all come and help the Indians when they are organizing, when they are doing anything - you must help them.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.660
That would be much better than to just come like great guests there and at the last minute to arrive, "Now, here we are -

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.980
now do what you like." [UNCLEAR - IT'S TYPICAL?]

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:15.220
And you are getting shocks after shocks. This time specially, I don't know, what had gone wrong, maybe the American trip might have clicked

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:23.760
otherwise, the best are the Australians, as far as, coming is concerned. They are very systematic but this time it was so difficult

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.560
to organize because they came at random, absolutely at random.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.380
So, I have to make a request on that point, that a month ahead means a

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.300
beginning of November, if you could deposit the money and let us know that you are coming,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.980
it's alright but otherwise we'll have to say no, which you should understand, that's very difficult

00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:00.040
to manage things there. Specially in London,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.260
they are very fed up with the people who are sending money, like this, in a haphazard way.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.720
So, they, Dr. Spiro wrote a very strong letter for all the leaders

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.920
that, "What are you doing, why can't you organize it properly and all," but I told him

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:23.280
"It's too strong, better not write like this, they'll be alright." "The next time Mother we will not do

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.680
all this banking business." I said, "I don't know any accounting,  how can I do it. You have to do the banking."

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.920
He said, "But this is not the way, they should come, we don't know how to manage."

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.720
So, you see, that part also one should see that one has to be more practical, you see. If you are Divine,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:47.440
you cannot live in some cloudy atmosphere. You must understand what you have to do.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:56.520
Now, we have covered most of the things but I'm also worried about the children here. We had a very nice school which was

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:02.520
finished without telling Me arbitrarily. I wish that school was here

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:11.380
but your leader has kindly accepted that he will see that the school is established for children because you are going for work

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:20.180
and the children are left at home sometimes or in schools where they can get spoilt and they may not have the same

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:26.300
culture that you have in sahaja yoga. So, if such a school - all of you should support and help

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.980
and you can all build it up also; Some labour is to be given and you can work it out.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.840
So, if it works out well, I'm sure, your children will have a proper place to go.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.620
Another thing is about our school in India.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.980
We're trying to do our level best to make the school absolutely streamlined but we have one problem. There are some children,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:57.880
very few, they are very dull; Most of the children are very intelligent, very good

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:05.820
and the standard in India is much higher. Now these dull children are left behind and we really don't know how to cope with them, what to do

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.760
because we don't want them to suffer also. Now, if you send them back, there will be a problem.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.080
But in India the system is like this - say, in the fourth class the children fail,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.880
then they are sent according to their aptitude to, some sort of a, farmer school or something.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:31.420
If they fail in a higher class, then again they are taken out - like that.Till the matriculation

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.260
they go on diverting all such children - so they have some place in life.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:44.420
But I don't know how to do because our school is only academic and I don't know how to put these children into various

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:50.180
other schools where they can learn some sort of a craft or maybe, something else.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.560
So, is a very, very big problem and I don't know how to solve it with the children who are dull.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.100
But I think, the parents are responsible for that and

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:10.380
please see to it that your children are studying alright. You can see their books and see

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:18.700
how much they have achieved in their education or not. Because individually you cannot pay attention to a person who is very low in understanding.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:26.000
This is the job of the parents here. Whatever you say, we are willing to do.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:33.580
We can put them in some other schools in India or we can work out something else for them but if they are dull,

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.240
we don't know what to force them on them, how to work it out

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.100
and that, wish the blame should not come on our schools but more on the

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:52.080
upbringing of the child, perhaps, maybe or maybe, some sort of circumstances

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:59.920
which has made him like that. We have to be sympathetic about these children but we should find out something which is very, very

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:08.580
congenial to them and which they can work it out better. This is another concern I have about our children there.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:17.160
Maximum number of children come from Australia. This time we had to increase the fees - it's not much.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:24.840
It's thousand rupees is hardly fifty dollars. Fifty dollars is nothing here. I mean, for a shoe you pay much more than that.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.200
So, one should not object because if you want us to improve the teaching, you want us to improve

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:38.120
all kinds of things like we are going to have music, we're going to teach them horse-riding, uh.. house building

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:46.220
so many other things they are being taught and we are getting six specialist teachers now from this year - they are going to work it out very much

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:53.280
with them, children then you must understand, if you want to educate them very well, then you need more money.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:00.820
To think that India is cheap, is also wrong idea, absolutely wrong idea because this time I was surprised how the prices have gone up.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:08.980
About the same as your country. They are about the same. Apart from that, you see, the

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:18.320
education in English schools - like My grandson is going to one English school there. He's paying seven thousand rupees,

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:25.880
seven thousand rupees as a day scholar; So the school doesn't pay for his food or anything.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.040
He's paying seven thousand as a day scholar and seventy-five thousand for admission.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:40.700
So compared to that, it's much cheaper for you just but if you send somebody to a very ordinary school in India, it might be cheaper.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:47.140
But for a special school or a school where English or a Cambridge

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:55.420
University is interested, it's very, very expensive. So, Cambridge University has accepted that they will allow our children to appear

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.040
for Cambridge education also. If they want, they can study further.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.440
So all these things I have to communicate to all of you.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.580
They are working very hard to see that the whole thing is streamlined

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.580
and they are provided with everything, very artistic things around them.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:28.200
Only problem which is between the parents and the teachers, is this that

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.140
lot of home-work is given to the children to go home and study.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.580
One of the reasons is that, if you allow three months the children complete abandoned life,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:47.200
as you have in the West, they will go into problems - they cannot come back to normal then.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.060
So, there should be some uh..

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:59.880
some way that you put them for studying something so their mind is in the studies

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:07.760
because once they come here - you see, the children are like that that they're not so career oriented, so they don't want to study.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.740
They say, the first thing I met the children, they said, "Mother, we don't want to study, " so I said, "Then why are you here?"

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.180
With Me they are very frank. "We don't want to study, Mother, " so but then, "What are you going to do here?"

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:29.000
"We are going to play." [LAUGHTER] "Can you imagine, so very frank!"

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:35.120
But that's what I say that the tendency of the Western children, is not career oriented

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:42.780
while our children, if you tell them that, "We are going to stop your school," - finished, I mean, they'll be so disturbed so they'll have to work very hard.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:50.600
The, on the contrary, the, here the tendency is to be playful and to be

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:56.280
enjoying everything. So that has to change also; You have to tell them the value of their life.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:03.860
Mostly they are realized souls and very intelligent but they are sometimes too intelligent and they want to outwit even the teachers.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.060
So, I've brought everything to your notice now that you can see for yourself

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:16.900
how you'll work it out with the children, how you'll explain and also try to

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.820
spend some time with them teaching them because they must come up to the same level -

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:29.240
it's very difficult, it's a very, very big problem for us and if you can find a solution, please let Me know.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:38.560
Now, we are having a, again a program, this time, of Ganapatipule

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:48.560
and all these people who want to marry, should really, give the forms and things

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:56.200
much before time so that your leaders can read it and find out. Some of the marriages,

00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.620
very few, have utterly failed. i would there blame the leaders also

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:08.780
that they should have studied the person what sort of person that is, what is the temperament, how it will work out.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:17.500
Say, the temperament is not alright or their professions are diagonally against each other,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:24.420
then it will not work out and this is where, I sometimes tell the leaders that they should scan

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:31.900
completely the nature and the whole attitude of the candidates who want to get married

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.740
and they should do at least for two years of sahaja yoga. If you have a very dominating woman who wants to marry, it's better is not to have her

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:48.180
or a dominating husband, better not have him. It's not important how many numbers we have for the marriage. What is important,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.880
how many marriages are successful quality-wise.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:22:00.860
So, from that angle you should give a complete idea about the girl and a complete idea about the boy.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:09.940
It's done in one month's time, it's such a vast work, I should say but despite that so many marriages are successful,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.400
luckily because of vibrations, but sometimes, you see, in a hurry and scurry,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:22.000
you can't just feel any vibrations and it's too difficult. So, it's the duty of the

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.460
leader, no doubt, but also if you know something about the person, you should come and

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:36.380
tell the leader that this is the situation is and that just now

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:43.520
such a, the person is feeling like doing it but may not be able to carry on because temperamently

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.720
such a person is not fit at all. So that advice will be nice. Specially also,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:56.180
just before getting married, if anybody thinks that has heard something from the boy or from the girl,

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.840
which shows less confidence, you should come and tell on your own

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.120
that, "Mother, there's such and such problem, You just verify," because this is eternal

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:17.140
relationship for which there should not be any problem, I think and people should know that it is very important.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.080
So, if you know or if you find something, you must let us know about that couple

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.840
that, "Mother, this was or whatever the problem is or they are talking, like this, among themselves."

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.860
That will solve the problem because when the marriages fail, it has a very, very

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.580
I [UNCLEAR], very, very deep damage

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:47.640
done to children, done to them, done to the name of sahaja yoga. So, I wish all the luck

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.580
for the marriages but still I would say, that whatever is done should be done with clear-cut understanding.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:24:00.720
Definitely we are working out well because out of all these marriages one in a while fails, so there's nothing wrong.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.440
May God bless you!

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:20.880
[HINDI - Ghar pe hi khana khayeinge] Will eat food at home only.
- Ji Shree Mataji. [HINDI- Thoda sa kuch dena chahte hain] Would like to give something.

Ohh, very good!

- [UNCLEAR]
- Beautiful!

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.220
- [UNCLEAR - LIKE THAT?]
- Absolutely, You may have seen but

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.120
- The other way round, I think
- [UNCLEAR]

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:31.740
Ahhh! So many [UNCLEAR - CUPS?] So thoughtful of you!

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.680
You see, I wanted to buy for that - should not have wasted so much money.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.180
I hope this is made in Australia [LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:50.620
- A lot of it [UNCLEAR] Australia
- Is it?
- Yes
- Then it's nice.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.460
Thank you very much.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.980
Thank you very much.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.640
So sweet of you but I don't think there's any need to do all that.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.540
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have helped her.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.460
It's good. You bring it along. Thank you very much.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:31.700
- From your this thing?
- Yes. You don't get as sweet as [UNCLEAR] in Melbourne.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.560
- Had You been here a little later, they would have been sweeter still
- It's quite good.
- Thank You.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.500
- It has a special taste - very

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:53.300
- [HINDI - Khatta hai] It's sour
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:03.020
Little sour. Thank you so.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:11.060
- Well
- [UNCLEAR]
- Where?
- I [UNCLEAR] in the Pooja

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:18.040
- [UNCLEAR] Shree Ganesha's little hand after the pooja
- Then there are eyes

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.580
- The last of few moments after they sing aarti, then this just came.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.100
Shree Ganesha is always protecting you.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:57.020
- This is His form
- This is His form. His tusk is here, His head is [UNCLEAR]

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.980
Beautiful!

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:11.060
- Shree Mother, we need to [UNCLEAR]

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.800
- It's nice.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:49.800
So, how many are for marriages this time [LAUGHTER]

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.360
If we could get the list, ahead of time, would be better - isn't it?  At least

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
we start our this thing in the end of, say, end of November

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.120
So, in October if you can get this and also money should start in October

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:27.440
so that by the time - last time till the 15th of November there was no money so,

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.180
- it created a problem for us quite a lot
- We can make [UNCLEAR] in the beginning of November Mother

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.480
- Ah, better is beginning of the November but the marriage list also should follow

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:45.880
because then we can the sit down and do it. Last minute when you are running from one place to another, you have to do it - that's not the way to do.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:02.540
- We go now.
- Ji, Shree Mataji
- Now enjoy your picnic.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.040
- [Hindi - Kaise ho?]How are you?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.620
Wow! Which one is this?

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:35.120
- Annh!
- [Hindi - Bole jaise hi Aap aaye woh phoolne laga season mein] They're saying as soon as You came, it started flowering.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.380
Thank you.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:55.760
- Annh?
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Can't hear.
- [ Hindi - Batein karna chahti hain Aapse.]She wants to talk to You.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:01.020
- [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]
- Tonight, I'll see them. Busy. Ah!

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.180
- [UNCLEAR - AVI?] Swaroop?
- She's very good Shree Mataji
- She's here?
- She's here.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:27.640

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.040
- To?
- Sydney
- Sydney?
- Sydney. Yes Shree Mataji.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:41.060
May God bless you. [MARATHI]

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:49.380
[MARATHI CONVERSATION]]

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:57.460
[MARATHI CONVERSATION]

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:05.300
[MARATHI CONVERSATION]

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:12.920
[MARATHI CONVERSATION]

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:22.400
You come. I would love to see people who are really in problem

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:30.960
and have some [UNCLEAR]. Nice, is it? Different taste - isn't it?

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:38.580
- [UNCLEAR]
- Jai Shree Mataji

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.080
You didn't do this, it's just

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:11.240
This one?

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:24.020
But even the ears

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.980
You are a sahaja yogi, that's why - remarkable!

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.100
This, this thing is [UNCLEAR] quite a lot

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.740
Unnh? [UNCLEAR]

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.820
They will never believe if you tell them. It's a fact there, it's reality;

00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.140
Difficult for people to understand this but it's a fact.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:08.520
Done it very well with such a feeling.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.700
Only in this photograph it has come? Only?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.480
[HINDI - Dekho yeh sar ke upar aur yeh kaan mein] See this above the head and in the ears.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.100
- Sahaja yoga is so remarkable!
- Yes.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.720
- Surprised. May God bless you!

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:54.600
Must ask for miraculous photographs all of you - that's very important.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.480
I don't know, if it is convincing to other people but at least

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.200
[UNCLEAR] What's the matter?

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:27.820
- What happened to you? Annh? Kya keh rahe?
- Cancer hai.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.860
- Cancer. Of what?

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:40.640
Cancer of? - bone? Backbone?

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:52.040
Backbone has got the cancer? Where?

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.880
On the back side? They removed it?

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:05.800
-[UNCLEAR]
- Annh?
-[UNCLEAR]

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:13.440
- [UNCLEAR]
-  there breast cancer to begin.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:23.420
Hmm. You have to give a three candle treatment - let's see how it works out.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.520
She might feel better. Did you feel the cool breeze in the hand?

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.300
What were you doing before you were a house-wife?

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.940
What work you were doing? Hunh?

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.260
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Accountant?
- [UNCLEAR] in a shop

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:04.040
Very right problem is there. Doesn't matter. You try three candle to begin with and then we'll see.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:10.300
The doctors are saying it's gone in the backbone? The whole of it?

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.220
[UNCLEAR]

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:59.220
- Just see on her head. Take a bandhan and see on her head. Take a bandhan
- You should take a bandhan first and then see

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.320
- Felt.
- On her head?
- On her head. 
- Hot?

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.820
One hand towards Me. Hot?

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:31.160
- Quite hot?
- Very hot.
- Center heart

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.360
Hold you breath, hold your breath.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.940
Leave it. Please hold your breath again.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.740
Now, leave it.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.920
Once again hold your breath

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.180
Leave it.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:17.980
- What? 
- Very sorry

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:25.300
[UNCLEAR] but as soon as [UNCLEAR] situation

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.920
and I can get it and she will be better.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.820
- [HINDI - Kya cheez?] Which thing?
- [HINDI - Homeopathic ki davai milti hai, usse theek hoti hain.]She gets better with homeopathic medicine.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.480
- That's not [UNCLEAR]
- To get it there at the system but...

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:48.580
- It's very much deep in her.
- Yeah.
- Better try three candle plus homeopathic you want to.
- Yeah.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:58.140
Starts with the center heart, that's why. Alright, May God bless you!

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.660
[HINDI - Saara sir garam kar diya] Whole head has become hot.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:16.600
- Yeah

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.400
- She's in coma?
- Yes.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.260
Let's see. I don't know

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.660
What's the need of a such a big woman to sit on a horse? [LAUGHTER]

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:40.660
She did not understand, mad - she's a grown up woman with children, everything

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.800
- and she didn't even know how to ride a horse
- Annh?
- First time
- She didn't even know how to ride the horse

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.060
- She did not know at this age she started
- No
- At this age she started
- First time

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.620
Stupidity personified at this age!

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.800
Her husband should have told her - extrovert!

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.660
Alright. May God bless you!

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:19.460
There's no wisdom in this kind of thing. I know of a lady - some Lord's wife -

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.740
and she was 83 years of age. We had dinner with her previous night.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.000
Second day we read in the newspaper, she's fallen from the horse and dead.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.960
83 years - what was the need for this 83 year old woman to jump on the horse.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:46.680
They don't mature - cheapish, childish people. I mean, there should be some dignity of age, of some understanding.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:56.820
- Not understandable, Mother.
- Can't help it, forget it.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:07.020
There's no wisdom - but this is an English lady I'm telling you about.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.280
American ladies, the worst; There's nothing in their heads, I think.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.000
They don't understand value of their life.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.900
Alright, May God bless you!

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:31.120
They do it

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.500
After sahaja yoga, one can see the wisdom of all this nonsense.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.100
May God bless you! Hello!

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.960
She's going [LAUGHTER]

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:12.300
So, you all have to sing a song for Me - all the little children.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.300
Alright?

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.860
- Mother, this is about [UNCLEAR] photos
- Alright, thank you.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:31.240
- You're [UNCLEAR] London. You were there?
- India last year for your birthday, Shree Mataji.
-  Ahh! [UNCLEAR]

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.500
Are you feeling better?

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:51.540
Bolo shree Adishakti Shree Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi ki Jai! Ki Jai! Ki Jai!

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.140
Thank You Mother.
