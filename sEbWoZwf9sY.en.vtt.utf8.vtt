00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:30.372
Today is the last day, ah, in this pendal

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:34.284
and today I'll be telling you

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:41.140
about the last center of Sahastrara.

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:06.000
They are all coming.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.637
If I come late it is better I think (Laughing).

00:01:13.028 --> 00:01:18.028
Still I was quite late I was thinking.

00:01:26.992 --> 00:01:29.612
Do you think this is needed on the eyes so much

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:32.628
or are you not getting My picture just?

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:36.605
This one if you could little bit push it the other way.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:40.038
This one is too much.

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:50.145
That's thank you.

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:15.226
So, this last center,

00:02:15.426 --> 00:02:26.003
 the Sahastrara, is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:38.369
Our head is like a coconut.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.432
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:49.516
and then a black covering

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:59.319
and inside is white shell

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.629
of coconut and inside is the space, the water.

00:03:06.084 --> 00:03:10.455
In the same way, our brain is made.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:14.924
That's why coconut is called as Shreephala.

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:26.238
Is the fruit of the power that is Shree.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:32.941
Shree power is the right side power

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:37.808
and the left side power is the Lalita power.

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:43.566
So, we have two Chakras - left side, here, is the Lalita

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:50.464
and right side, here, is the Shree Chakra.

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:57.105
These two Chakras are working out

00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:00.566
the right side Mahasaraswati's power

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:05.906
and left side Mahakali's powers.

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:14.621
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:21.590
That has to rise and penetrate through different Chakras,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.910
enter into the limbic area and enlighten the seven Pithas -

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.973
seats of these seven Chakras.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.536
So, it penetrates through six Chakras,

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:43.911
enters into the limbic area,

00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:52.517
enlightens all the seven Pithas in the brain,

00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:58.962
which are placed along the mid-line of the limbic area.

00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:03.290
So, we start it from the back, is placed here,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.938
at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:05:08.138 --> 00:05:14.586
Around it is the Swadishthana,

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:19.938
then is the Nabhi, then the Heart,

00:05:20.138 --> 00:05:24.696
then the Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:31.219
So, all these six centers are combining

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.985
to make the seventh center.

00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:39.415
This is a very important point, which we should know.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:43.187
Now, the Shree Chakra is the right side working

00:05:43.388 --> 00:05:47.476
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:53.914
So, when the Kundalini doesn't rise

00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:59.469
then we do with our right side

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.219
our physical and mental activities.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.953
So our brain is doing right side activity

00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:12.521
and that's why our brain is like Shreephala.

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.773
Sahastrara is actually

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:28.250
is the assemblage of these six Chakras

00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:30.984
and is a hollow space,

00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:35.781
on the sides of it there are one thousand Nadis.

00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:42.375
And when the light penetrates into the limbic area,

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:50.554
then the enlightenment of these Nadis take place

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:54.202
and you can see them as flames,

00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:58.288
very gentle flames burning

00:06:58.489 --> 00:07:02.101
and these flames have all the seven colors

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:07.825
that you see in the vibjyor.

00:07:09.294 --> 00:07:14.663
But the last one, ultimately becomes again integrated

00:07:14.864 --> 00:07:17.851
and it is a crystal clear flame.

00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:25.083
All these seven lights ultimately become crystal clear.

00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:30.913
So, you have Sahastrara with one thousand petals,

00:07:31.114 --> 00:07:33.835
as they called it,

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:39.874
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section

00:07:40.075 --> 00:07:44.444
or horizontal section, you will be able to see

00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:49.780
that all these nerves are built like this

00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:54.507
along the limbic area, all of them are like a petal,

00:07:54.708 --> 00:08:00.249
and if you cut it like this, you will find that

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:08.012
there are many nerves in every bundle of nerves.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.705
So, when it is enlightened,

00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:25.741
you can see Sahastrara as a burning bundle of flames.

00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:37.121
When I'm speaking you should not do all these things, please.

00:08:41.107 --> 00:08:45.591
They are still coming and just disturbing Me.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:51.810
This a very deep subject.

00:08:56.601 --> 00:09:01.408
So the, when the enlightenment of the Kundalini

00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:07.822
takes place in the brain,

00:09:08.023 --> 00:09:15.056
then the truth is perceived through your brain.

00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:17.690
That's why it's called as Satyakhand, means

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:24.729
you start seeing the truth perceived by your brain

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.245
because so far whatever you see through your brain,

00:09:29.446 --> 00:09:33.042
is not the truth.

00:09:33.243 --> 00:09:36.815
What you see, is just the outer side,

00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:39.729
say, you can see the colors.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.338
You can see the different aesthetics of the colors.

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:48.533
You can see the quality of the thing.

00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:53.252
But you cannot say

00:09:53.453 --> 00:09:59.275
whether this carpet has been used by some saint.

00:09:59.476 --> 00:10:03.074
You cannot say whether this is made by a devil

00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:06.996
or a divine person.

00:10:07.197 --> 00:10:10.457
You cannot say that this gentleman,

00:10:10.658 --> 00:10:16.973
is he a good person or he is an evil person.

00:10:17.174 --> 00:10:20.825
You cannot say if this Deity

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:25.888
has come out of the Mother Earth or not.

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:35.985
Also, you cannot say about any person,

00:10:36.186 --> 00:10:38.377
who is your relation,

00:10:38.578 --> 00:10:48.002
whether he is a good relation or a bad relation,

00:10:48.203 --> 00:10:50.281
or what sort of a person he is,

00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:54.383
whether he goes to wrong people or to the right people,

00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:57.789
whether he has connections with wrong side

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.575
or with good side.

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:05.067
Here good means Divine. So actually you do not know

00:11:05.268 --> 00:11:09.887
anything about divinity with your mind, nothing.

00:11:10.088 --> 00:11:13.973
Nothing - is impossible for you to judge a person

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:17.226
about his divinity unless and until the Kundalini

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:22.085
reaches at least this part, which is the limbic area.

00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:26.921
You cannot make out whether a person is real or not,

00:11:27.122 --> 00:11:31.171
whether a guru is real or not.

00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:37.984
Because divinity cannot be perceived through your brain,

00:11:38.185 --> 00:11:45.958
unless and until this light of your Spirit shines into it.

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:50.206
Now, the Spirit is expressed in the heart,

00:11:50.407 --> 00:11:52.407
is reflected in the heart,

00:11:52.608 --> 00:11:56.602
the center of the Spirit, we can say, is in the heart.

00:11:56.803 --> 00:12:02.071
But actually, the seat of Spirit is above, here

00:12:02.272 --> 00:12:06.727
And that is the Spirit what we call of the God Almighty,

00:12:06.928 --> 00:12:16.066
Who say, Whom you call [SOUNDS LIKE Parvardigar],

00:12:16.267 --> 00:12:19.699
you call Him Sadashiva

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:27.582
or you can call Him, ah, the Rahim

00:12:27.783 --> 00:12:30.316
and you can call Him by many names

00:12:30.517 --> 00:12:35.800
which are said about

00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:40.988
the Lord who is God Almighty.

00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:44.972
Neeranjan, they call It, Neerankar,

00:12:45.173 --> 00:12:50.613
every sort of words which start with Nira, Nihi.

00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:57.185
Now, at every center

00:12:57.386 --> 00:13:02.376
in the body you'll receive a different type of joy.

00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:06.893
Every center has a different type of joy

00:13:07.094 --> 00:13:10.010
and there are names for every types of joy

00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.471
you receive at every center when the Kundalini rises.

00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:19.026
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahastrara,

00:13:19.227 --> 00:13:24.003
then the joy you receive is called as Neerananda,

00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:25.750
Neerananda.

00:13:25.951 --> 00:13:33.357
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda. Neerananda.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.329
Also, is surprising, My name is Neera -

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.993
also, in My family I'm called as Neera.

00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:46.266
And Neera also means Mary, Maria.

00:13:46.467 --> 00:13:49.532
Because it means marine. Neera is water.

00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:52.524
Neera means water in Sanskrit language.

00:13:52.725 --> 00:13:57.329
It is called as Neerananda in the brain.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:02.110
And this stage ultimately unfolds.

00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:07.290
First what you know is the Satya, is the Truth -

00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:12.790
what is this another gentleman is suffering from,

00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:17.329
that you see on your fingers. First you see your fingers.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.142
With your attention you know what Chakras,

00:14:21.343 --> 00:14:24.165
what fingers are catching, with your attention.

00:14:24.366 --> 00:14:28.259
Then with your brain you can depict

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.751
what center, which is catching.

00:14:30.952 --> 00:14:32.952
Because, if you say this finger,

00:14:33.153 --> 00:14:36.007
that doesn't mean it is Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:40.202
But your brain then says, "It is Vishuddhi."

00:14:40.403 --> 00:14:44.371
And that depicts it that this fellow is suffering

00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:47.980
from the troubles of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:14:48.181 --> 00:14:51.261
But still it is rational.

00:14:51.462 --> 00:14:55.792
Because you see what finger it catches and then you say it.

00:14:55.993 --> 00:15:04.264
But when the Satyakhanda or the Sahastrara unfolds itself more,

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:09.988
you don't have to think about it, you just say it.

00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:18.358
Then there is no difference between your Chitta and your Satya.

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:28.011
The enlightened Chitta and the enlightened brain become one.

00:15:29.613 --> 00:15:32.420
There is no problem at all for such a person,

00:15:32.621 --> 00:15:35.927
there's no need to see on the fingers, no need to say

00:15:36.128 --> 00:15:39.974
anything on the fingers and then depict it through brain.

00:15:40.175 --> 00:15:42.638
Which you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:47.115
that if you find something wrong here, it means Agnya -

00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:51.948
that's not necessary! You just say Agnya.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.542
And you just say it and it is there.

00:15:58.073 --> 00:16:03.856
Then it unfolds more.

00:16:04.057 --> 00:16:08.989
First it is integrated with, as I said, Chitta.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:17.918
Then, when it gets absolutely integrated with the Spirit,

00:16:18.126 --> 00:16:25.290
then whatever you say, is the truth.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.374
You just say it, it is so.

00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:42.194
That is how this brain unfolds into three new dimensions.

00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:50.437
First, it depicts the truth through logical conclusions.

00:16:50.638 --> 00:16:54.742
Because, I have told you that

00:16:54.943 --> 00:16:58.422
if this finger is catching then it is Vishuddhi.

00:16:58.623 --> 00:17:01.477
And then you ask the person, "Have you got a problem here?"

00:17:01.678 --> 00:17:04.961
He says, "Yes". Then you believe in Me

00:17:05.162 --> 00:17:08.352
and then you believe that this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:17:08.553 --> 00:17:10.553
which is showing, is true.

00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:13.422
This is the logical conclusion, in a way,

00:17:13.623 --> 00:17:17.695
that you have experimented, you are seeing

00:17:17.896 --> 00:17:21.125
and still doubting whether Mother says it's true or not.

00:17:21.326 --> 00:17:24.102
And then, you are sure, "Yes, it is so,

00:17:24.303 --> 00:17:26.547
we have seen that this is Vishuddhi Chakra." So,

00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:30.055
the truth becomes logically acceptable to his brain.

00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:35.086
But still, there is the brain working out on its gross level.

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:43.148
Then the second stage, as I told you, where you believe,

00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:45.977
you know for definite that this means Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:17:46.178 --> 00:17:48.178
no doubt about it. Nobody.

00:17:48.379 --> 00:17:50.795
Then - then we start Nirvikalpa has started,

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:54.389
when there's no doubt about Me or Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:59.100
But then, the new unfolding starts within.

00:17:59.301 --> 00:18:04.108
For that, one has to do meditation.

00:18:04.309 --> 00:18:09.684
In humility, one has to do meditation.

00:18:10.543 --> 00:18:13.944
And then also, for this new dimension,

00:18:14.145 --> 00:18:19.036
where your Chitta itself becomes merged

00:18:19.237 --> 00:18:24.559
into your brain or into the enlightened brain,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.280
for that one has to very honestly and humbly

00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:34.585
surrender to Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:40.405
Now, what do we do when we get our vibrations?

00:18:40.606 --> 00:18:42.882
We have different-different reactions.

00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:48.109
Some people do not even understand the value of vibrations.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:53.520
Some people try to learn what it means.

00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:57.952
And some people suddenly think, "O, now they are realized souls,

00:18:58.153 --> 00:19:00.608
they can go on giving realizations, this, that."

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:05.457
They go on a ride of a ego-trip.

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:10.186
When they go on a ride of a ego-trip, then they find that

00:19:10.387 --> 00:19:12.506
they've failed and they've to come back,

00:19:12.707 --> 00:19:16.569
from the very beginning they start. It's like

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.121
the game of Snake &amp; Ladder.

00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:27.615
So, reaction to vibration should be

00:19:27.816 --> 00:19:33.138
a very humble, receptive reaction.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:39.177
Now, on the gross level, because as I told you that the brain

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:45.685
is the one which holds the Father in it.

00:19:45.886 --> 00:19:50.912
So, if we commit any sins against the Father,

00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:57.823
then this unfoldment in the brain takes some time.

00:19:58.818 --> 00:20:02.930
So, we start reading books.

00:20:03.131 --> 00:20:05.913
And though people have told that first see the vibrations

00:20:06.114 --> 00:20:08.114
and then read the books, still we say, "O, what's wrong,

00:20:08.315 --> 00:20:11.046
we should read other books."

00:20:11.247 --> 00:20:14.804
You go down again, Snake and Ladder, as I said.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:19.544
That is one of the snakes.

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:22.427
We think that, "What's the need to do meditation,

00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:27.825
I've no time, I have this thing, that thing." You do not progress.

00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:32.604
The other point which is very gross.

00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:35.971
Also, there are some very gross people in Sahaja Yoga

00:20:36.172 --> 00:20:39.159
who enter into it. Doesn't matter.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.005
But first thing you must know you have to be honest,

00:20:42.206 --> 00:20:45.630
very honest in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:49.958
The honesty is like - I have seen people.

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:54.396
If we have a dinner, say, for a marriage-party,

00:20:54.597 --> 00:20:58.255
they'll just crawl into it without having any self-respect,

00:20:58.456 --> 00:21:00.759
without having any understanding as to

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.056
who is going to pay for the all this? They'll bring all their family,

00:21:04.257 --> 00:21:07.228
come down and sit down.

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:12.775
There are people who avoid paying money

00:21:12.976 --> 00:21:16.978
which should be paid for Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:17.179 --> 00:21:19.986
Supposing, they're eating food or they are travelling

00:21:20.187 --> 00:21:24.072
or they're coming from abroad,

00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:28.306
they have to pay money for their travelling, for their food.

00:21:28.507 --> 00:21:32.001
And, sometimes, you know I have to pay lot of money.

00:21:32.202 --> 00:21:35.453
Doesn't matter, I don't mind. But is not good for you,

00:21:35.654 --> 00:21:39.023
the main thing it's not good for you.

00:21:39.224 --> 00:21:42.644
So, how you behave towards Sahaja Yoga

00:21:42.845 --> 00:21:45.613
as far as money is concerned is also very important,

00:21:45.814 --> 00:21:49.894
though it looks gross. But it can give a big trouble

00:21:50.095 --> 00:21:54.605
in the unfoldment because of the Nabhi catching

00:21:54.806 --> 00:21:57.753
and, as you know, if the Nabhi catches

00:21:57.954 --> 00:22:01.878
it can spread up to the whole of void.

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:05.339
And if the void is catching Ekadesha Rudra,

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:10.563
which is placed here, the destructive forces, built-in.

00:22:11.353 --> 00:22:16.816
So, before coming to Sahaja Yoga, it was all right,

00:22:17.017 --> 00:22:19.339
you're doing all kinds of things

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.066
and you'd have smoothly gone to hell without any difficulties.

00:22:24.267 --> 00:22:26.629
It is very easy to go to hell.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.277
You can take two running jumps and go to hell.

00:22:30.478 --> 00:22:34.918
The rest of it you should see. But going to hell is the easiest thing.

00:22:35.126 --> 00:22:39.159
For that you don't have to work hard or do anything about it.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.307
But, when you are ascending, when you are rising,

00:22:44.508 --> 00:22:46.948
then it is little difficult.

00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:50.057
You have to be careful that you should not falter,

00:22:50.258 --> 00:22:53.963
you should not fall and that you are ascending.

00:22:54.164 --> 00:22:56.869
So, you have to be very alert about yourself

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:02.150
that you are not falling into the same habits, which you had.

00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:07.713
Some people have a habit of saving money at the cost of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:07.914 --> 00:23:12.221
Some have a habit of making money at the cost of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:12.422 --> 00:23:18.229
Some people have habit of not giving the due amount -

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:23.471
and like that. It's something, you know, of cheating.

00:23:23.672 --> 00:23:25.927
They all go out of Sahaja Yoga in no time.

00:23:26.128 --> 00:23:29.068
They may be looking like great leaders in the beginning,

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:33.209
but they go out just like that. And many a time people tell Me

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.592
"why don't You keep a proper account and all that".

00:23:35.793 --> 00:23:38.509
But in Sahaja Yoga I'm not supposed to keep any accounts

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.064
or anything. Because My accountants are Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:45.265
If you try to play tricks with Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:45.466 --> 00:23:48.578
immediately you are pushed out; in your awareness,

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:51.289
in your Nabhi Chakra you are never helped -

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.490
you may make a thousand rupees here,

00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:56.646
but you will thousands of rupees by get into trouble.

00:23:56.847 --> 00:24:00.326
You will have any kind of a problem that I cannot tell you

00:24:00.527 --> 00:24:05.193
and then you will say, "how did I get this problem?"

00:24:05.394 --> 00:24:12.513
So, Nabhi Chakra if you are not honest in your seeking.

00:24:12.714 --> 00:24:16.059
Honesty of seeking not only means "I want to seek."

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.825
It also means what is your behavior is,

00:24:19.026 --> 00:24:22.497
towards yourself and towards others.

00:24:22.698 --> 00:24:24.969
You have to be honest to yourself

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.727
that you sit down for meditation,

00:24:27.928 --> 00:24:30.899
try to improve your Antar Yoga,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.485
try to make your - ah - thoughtless awareness,

00:24:36.686 --> 00:24:41.852
this feeling of thoughtlessness, wider and wider.

00:24:42.053 --> 00:24:48.326
Try to achieve that state where you really feel thoughtless.

00:24:49.702 --> 00:24:53.475
So the honesty lies as you rise higher and higher,

00:24:53.676 --> 00:24:56.772
deeper and deeper into your own being.

00:24:56.973 --> 00:25:02.085
First you depend on Me, that "after all, Mother is going to do everything.

00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:05.452
When I went to Mother, my Sahastrara opened out.

00:25:05.653 --> 00:25:08.171
This thing happened, then this thing happened."

00:25:08.372 --> 00:25:12.116
But what about you doing something that helps you

00:25:12.317 --> 00:25:14.585
to open your Sahastrara.

00:25:14.786 --> 00:25:20.606
So, opening of the Sahastrara is very important.

00:25:20.997 --> 00:25:26.880
Now, surprisingly, it is so placed that Sahastrara has got

00:25:27.081 --> 00:25:30.786
the Brahmarandhra at the level where there is,

00:25:30.987 --> 00:25:35.989
I mean, at the point, where there is the Heart Chakra.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.091
So, we must know that Brahmarandhra

00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:43.669
is directly connected to your heart.

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:49.747
If it is not done from the heart, superficially done Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.948
you can not go very high.

00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:55.159
You have to put your full heart into it -

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.448
that is the main thing.

00:25:57.649 --> 00:26:00.104
Like, people they come to Sahaja Yog

00:26:00.305 --> 00:26:02.305
and they are murmuring behind.

00:26:02.506 --> 00:26:05.149
"This could have been like that, that could have been like that,"

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:10.704
all those things. All such people also are

00:26:10.905 --> 00:26:14.371
what Christ calls as "murmuring souls." He said that,

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.840
be careful about these murmuring souls -

00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:21.920
those who go on murmuring behind and taking advantage

00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:28.801
- ah - as if - ah - they, they are trying to save others.

00:26:29.002 --> 00:26:32.418
All such people also can suffer a lot.

00:26:32.619 --> 00:26:35.746
Because, they are doing a double game.

00:26:35.947 --> 00:26:39.496
And such a double game is very dangerous

00:26:39.697 --> 00:26:43.496
when you enter into the kingdom of God.

00:26:43.697 --> 00:26:48.004
Any kingdom you are member of, any kingdom,

00:26:48.205 --> 00:26:51.731
if you are treacherous to that kingdom, you are punished.

00:26:51.932 --> 00:26:55.667
But in the God's kingdom, it's so blissful,

00:26:55.868 --> 00:27:02.013
absolutely blissful, complete blessings are poured on,

00:27:02.214 --> 00:27:08.724
absolutely, with everything - health, wealth,

00:27:08.925 --> 00:27:12.622
mental, emotional - all kinds of prosperity

00:27:12.823 --> 00:27:15.384
you can get in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:27:15.585 --> 00:27:20.392
But when you are so much blessed, you are also forgiven,

00:27:20.593 --> 00:27:24.517
and forgiven, and forgiven, and there is a long rope

00:27:24.718 --> 00:27:30.619
given to you to hang yourself. But you really hang fully,

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.726
it's not half way.

00:27:32.927 --> 00:27:36.523
So, those people who think they can be dishonest

00:27:36.724 --> 00:27:38.724
with Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:38.966 --> 00:27:42.054
have to be very careful; please don't do it.

00:27:42.255 --> 00:27:44.857
If you don't like to be in Sahaja Yoga, you better go away,

00:27:45.058 --> 00:27:50.349
is better; from your point of view and from our point of view also.

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:54.372
Because, in case you are dishonest,

00:27:54.573 --> 00:27:57.341
you are trying to play tricks and games,

00:27:57.542 --> 00:28:02.693
and you suffer and you look funny and strange,

00:28:02.894 --> 00:28:05.654
then people will say "what's wrong with Sahaja Yoga?"

00:28:05.855 --> 00:28:09.376
So we will unnecessarily suffer. Because we cannot show you

00:28:09.577 --> 00:28:16.610
in the mirror, that this man has been very, very - aaah - disloyal.

00:28:16.811 --> 00:28:19.735
We cannot show that. So, it will bring a bad name to us -

00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:23.610
first of all. And secondly, you will be harmed,

00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:26.563
by this kind of a thing. If you are harmed,

00:28:26.764 --> 00:28:32.063
then also we'll have a bad name that "how could it happened?"

00:28:32.264 --> 00:28:35.571
But if you are honest about Sahaja Yoga

00:28:35.772 --> 00:28:38.634
and about your seeking,

00:28:38.835 --> 00:28:41.939
you don't know how much God looks after you.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.946
Anybody who tries to do any harm to you will be

00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:48.384
very badly harmed and removed from your path.

00:28:48.585 --> 00:28:52.915
God protects you out and out and He looks after you

00:28:53.116 --> 00:28:58.204
with complete attention and care.

00:28:58.405 --> 00:29:03.267
And He's so loving that description of His compassion

00:29:03.468 --> 00:29:09.553
cannot be given in words but can be only felt and understood.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.634
Now, the problem is, people who are dishonest

00:29:14.835 --> 00:29:18.736
are because of their background, sometimes,

00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:26.150
because of their education, because of their upbringing

00:29:26.351 --> 00:29:30.728
or may be because they are cowards.

00:29:30.929 --> 00:29:34.400
But there is also another thing that can make you dishonest -

00:29:34.601 --> 00:29:39.947
is your poorva-janmas and that's how you take your birth

00:29:40.148 --> 00:29:46.619
and your Kundalini is made like that. But after Realization,

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.916
those people who are of a great valor

00:29:51.117 --> 00:29:55.611
and great strength ascend so fast

00:29:55.812 --> 00:29:59.330
that all the problems of the stars,

00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:04.291
all the problems of your Nakshatras and all that constellations,

00:30:04.492 --> 00:30:07.089
everything disappears and you become a Sahaja Yogi

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.198
means a newly born, absolutely a different personality;

00:30:10.399 --> 00:30:15.261
it has nothing to do from where you have come.

00:30:15.462 --> 00:30:21.415
Like an egg becoming a beautiful bird.

00:30:24.096 --> 00:30:27.895
So, this Kundalini, when it arrives here,

00:30:28.096 --> 00:30:35.692
the first hurdle the Kundalini has to enter into Sahastrara,

00:30:35.893 --> 00:30:39.841
is Ekadesha Rudra, is here.

00:30:40.042 --> 00:30:47.268
There are 11 rudra shaktis, 11 destroying shaktis placed here.

00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:54.576
Five on this side, five on the other side and one in the center.

00:31:01.796 --> 00:31:06.533
These are obstruction within us,

00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:11.072
built by two kinds of sins we commit.

00:31:11.273 --> 00:31:16.525
If we bow our head to wrong type of gurus

00:31:16.726 --> 00:31:23.564
and submit ourselves to their vicious ways,

00:31:23.765 --> 00:31:29.134
then we develop rudra sh... -

00:31:29.335 --> 00:31:35.295
rudra problems on the left hand side - these five go out.

00:31:48.401 --> 00:31:54.575
If you have, I think it's other way round, ha, is the -

00:31:54.776 --> 00:31:58.679
if you have bowed - because I've never bowed to anybody wrong,

00:31:58.888 --> 00:32:03.484
so I don't know what to say, the mistake comes from there.

00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:10.851
If you bow to someone who is a wrong type of a person

00:32:11.052 --> 00:32:19.085
and who is anti God,

00:32:19.286 --> 00:32:29.263
then the problem comes on this side of the thing,

00:32:29.464 --> 00:32:32.510
on the right side.

00:32:33.378 --> 00:32:39.029
If you have the sense that "I can look after myself,

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.474
I'm my own guru, I, who can teach me,

00:32:42.675 --> 00:32:46.068
I don't want to listen to anybody and I don't believe in God,

00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:49.857
ah - who is God, I just don't care for God".

00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:54.630
All such feeling, if you have, then,

00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:59.833
your right side doesn't catch, but the left side catches.

00:33:00.034 --> 00:33:05.744
Because right side moves this side and the left side this side.

00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:11.801
So these ten things and one is Virata Vishnu, because also

00:33:12.002 --> 00:33:14.869
in the stomach we have got 10 Guru Sthanas

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.674
and one that of Vishnu.

00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:22.080
So, the seeking is also wrong,

00:33:22.281 --> 00:33:27.499
as well as these 10 Gurus are there.

00:33:28.453 --> 00:33:33.268
Then you develop this Ekadesha Rudra.

00:33:33.469 --> 00:33:38.604
When this thing is settle - set in within you,

00:33:38.805 --> 00:33:43.245
as I said, one on this side, one on that side.

00:33:43.446 --> 00:33:47.987
So, those people who are bowed to wrong type of people

00:33:48.188 --> 00:33:55.261
develop a temperament or a kind of a personality

00:33:55.462 --> 00:33:58.253
which is very vulnerable for incurable diseases

00:33:58.454 --> 00:34:00.454
like cancer and all that.

00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:04.964
You may develop cancer or any such disease -

00:34:05.165 --> 00:34:10.344
those who have bowed to wrong type of people.

00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:17.042
Now, those who think, "I'm better than anybody else.

00:34:17.243 --> 00:34:20.534
I don't care for God, I don't want God, I've nothing to do"-

00:34:20.735 --> 00:34:28.927
all such people develop the left side Ekadesha.

00:34:30.265 --> 00:34:37.251
And left side Ekadesha is extremely dangerous too.

00:34:37.452 --> 00:34:41.665
Because such people develop the problems of the right side -

00:34:41.866 --> 00:34:47.384
heart attacks, physically I am saying,

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:52.475
and all other problems of the right side.

00:34:56.551 --> 00:35:01.904
So, one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini entering into

00:35:02.105 --> 00:35:08.948
Sahastrara is this Ekadesha Rudra, which comes from Void.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:20.373
And which covers the Medha - is the plate of the brain.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:31.341
And that is how it cannot enter into the limbic area.

00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:38.938
Even those who have been to wrong gurus,

00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:41.290
if they've reached right conclusion

00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:45.017
and surrender themselves to Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:45.218 --> 00:35:49.705
accepting their mistakes and saying

00:35:49.906 --> 00:35:53.877
that "I am my own Guru,"

00:35:54.078 --> 00:35:58.111
they can be cured. And those, who have been thinking

00:35:58.312 --> 00:36:00.763
that "I'm above all, I don't believe in God, who is God,

00:36:00.964 --> 00:36:02.983
I don't believe in any prophets or anything" -

00:36:03.184 --> 00:36:06.452
anything against God or prophets is the same.

00:36:06.653 --> 00:36:15.023
Anti-God personality who talks like that, who develops the problems,

00:36:15.224 --> 00:36:23.550
gets all right if he humbles down himself

00:36:23.751 --> 00:36:27.534
and accepts Sahaja Yoga is the only way

00:36:27.735 --> 00:36:34.573
of - of entering into the superconsciousness.

00:36:34.774 --> 00:36:40.128
I've seen people who have been Tantrikas, are being saved.

00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:44.464
I've seen people who have done all kinds of wrong things

00:36:44.665 --> 00:36:47.908
have been saved. Those people, who were members

00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:54.780
of very funny, strange organizations have been saved.

00:36:55.179 --> 00:37:01.072
But - it is very difficult to convince anyone

00:37:01.273 --> 00:37:04.260
that whatever they are doing has been wrong

00:37:04.461 --> 00:37:08.362
and they should come to right path.

00:37:08.563 --> 00:37:19.851
So, a star came to play its part called Pluto,

00:37:20.052 --> 00:37:27.342
and this star is the one which has brought cancer disease

00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:32.436
because, Pluto is the one that cures cancer,

00:37:32.637 --> 00:37:38.045
or all such diseases which are incurable.

00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:47.872
So, those people who just go head-long into wrong paths,

00:37:48.073 --> 00:37:52.989
suffer from funny type of heart troubles,

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.372
palpitations,

00:37:57.573 --> 00:38:01.677
insomnia,

00:38:01.878 --> 00:38:05.185
vomitings,

00:38:05.386 --> 00:38:08.052
giddiness,

00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:15.893
all sorts of ah, we can say irrelevant talking.

00:38:18.074 --> 00:38:22.939
It is a very serious thing to go to a wrong guru

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:27.460
and bow to him.

00:38:29.038 --> 00:38:39.260
Sahastrara becomes a closed area for such a person.

00:38:42.384 --> 00:38:45.584
The persons who are against Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:45.785 --> 00:38:50.303
have a very strong Sahastrara, like a nut,

00:38:50.504 --> 00:38:53.551
in the sense that it's such a strong shell

00:38:53.752 --> 00:38:57.121
that you can not just break it - it's a strong shell,

00:38:57.322 --> 00:39:00.418
like a thick nut.

00:39:00.619 --> 00:39:07.111
Even if you want to use a hammer, you cannot break it.

00:39:07.963 --> 00:39:11.918
Today, the time has come,

00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:15.410
that you have to recognize Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:17.723
you have to.

00:39:17.924 --> 00:39:21.739
You did not recognize any saints, any prophets, anyone,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.744
any incarnations. ealization.

00:39:23.945 --> 00:39:27.591
But today the condition is that you have to recognize.

00:39:27.792 --> 00:39:31.263
If you do not recognize it, your Sahastrara cannot be opened

00:39:31.464 --> 00:39:35.351
because this is the time when the Sahastrara was opened

00:39:35.552 --> 00:39:38.117
and you have to have your Realization.

00:39:38.318 --> 00:39:45.484
So it's a very important thing that you have to recognize

00:39:45.685 --> 00:39:47.373
Sahaja Yoga. There are many people who say that

00:39:47.574 --> 00:39:50.662
"Mother, why to believe in Sahaja Yoga this way,

00:39:50.863 --> 00:39:54.975
we can just call You just Mother, You could be my Mother," you see.

00:39:55.176 --> 00:39:59.600
All right, doesn't matter. But you can't get your Realization.

00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:02.959
And even if you get it, you cannot retain it.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.628
So you have to recognize, recognition is the only

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:15.037
worship of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:15.238 --> 00:40:24.237
Recognition is the only worship when you want to know

00:40:24.438 --> 00:40:27.932
God in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:34.784
All the other Ganas, Devatas, Deities, Shaktis,

00:40:34.985 --> 00:40:40.026
are one in unison in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:40.227 --> 00:40:44.706
And anyone who does not recognize Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:44.907 --> 00:40:47.269
They just are not bothered about you,

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.737
what sort of a person you are.

00:40:50.938 --> 00:40:55.042
For example, a man who worships Shiva,

00:40:55.243 --> 00:40:57.463
he comes to Me,

00:40:57.664 --> 00:41:02.361
and I find his heart is catching - surprising.

00:41:02.562 --> 00:41:07.205
He says, "Mother, I worship Shiva, how is it, my heart is catching?"

00:41:07.406 --> 00:41:10.893
I said, "You have to recognize Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:13.706
Just ask Shiva."

00:41:13.907 --> 00:41:16.409
And when he asked the questions to Shiva,

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.425
then only the vibrations start flowing.

00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:24.909
So, Sahastrara takes charge

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.862
that it makes you recognize and also it convinces you -

00:41:29.063 --> 00:41:33.094
to proves it to you.

00:41:33.376 --> 00:41:39.573
And by this proving, even if you are not recognizing,

00:41:39.774 --> 00:41:46.047
then you cannot get your Realization.

00:41:48.519 --> 00:41:54.084
But those who recognize also, recognize partly -

00:41:54.285 --> 00:41:57.735
they take liberties, they behave in a funny manner

00:41:57.936 --> 00:42:04.251
without understanding that Who is this Person, Who is here?

00:42:04.452 --> 00:42:07.999
I've seen many a times, I'm talking, people are just putting

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.470
their hand up, Kundalini, they are just talking,

00:42:11.671 --> 00:42:16.720
chit chatting - I'm surprised. Because, if you have recognized,

00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:19.876
then you should know whom you are facing.

00:42:20.077 --> 00:42:23.962
Because, it's not for My good, I'm not going to lose anything.

00:42:24.163 --> 00:42:26.696
But only you, in your ascent have not recognized.

00:42:26.897 --> 00:42:31.756
That shows that you have not yet recognized.

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:38.024
And the way some people try to monopolize Me also,

00:42:38.225 --> 00:42:41.423
is absolutely wrong. There is no need to monopolize Me,

00:42:41.624 --> 00:42:45.334
nobody can monopolize. There are some people who say that

00:42:45.535 --> 00:42:48.459
"Mother must have misunderstood." I never misunderstand,

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.889
there's no question. Or, some people try to tell Me,

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:56.655
"Do this, do that" - that also not necessary.

00:42:56.856 --> 00:43:01.108
Try to open yourself to this protocol

00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:03.309
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.014
which I have told for the first time today,

00:43:06.215 --> 00:43:11.577
that you must try to recognize in a full way.

00:43:11.778 --> 00:43:15.030
And if you do not recognize, I'm sorry,

00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:19.141
I can't give you the Realization, which will sustain,

00:43:19.342 --> 00:43:23.875
I'll, it will start, but it may not sustain.

00:43:24.076 --> 00:43:29.375
So, this is the simplest way of achieving your higher things

00:43:29.576 --> 00:43:34.779
is by recognizing gradually and recognizing gradually.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.070
It is very difficult to tell anybody if something is wrong

00:43:41.271 --> 00:43:44.164
with that person, it's impossible.

00:43:44.365 --> 00:43:47.148
After Sahaja Yoga, I can tell you, this Chakra is catching,

00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:50.025
that Chakra is catching. But also because you know

00:43:50.226 --> 00:43:52.525
what does that Chakra means, you can come back on me.

00:43:52.726 --> 00:43:55.306
"No, no, Mother, You see, it's not so. I'm not."

00:43:55.507 --> 00:43:58.087
That's not so, why should I tell you you are catching?

00:43:58.288 --> 00:44:01.571
You have to cleanse yourself with full honesty.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:05.188
But first thing is to recognize with full humility

00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:07.930
and understanding.

00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:14.039
Once you have recognized, gradually you will do everything

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:19.904
that has to be done, you'll know - what is to be done.

00:44:23.262 --> 00:44:29.199
Now the essence of Sahastrara is integration.

00:44:31.852 --> 00:44:34.131
In Sahastrara all the Chakras are there,

00:44:34.332 --> 00:44:38.381
so all the Deities get integrated.

00:44:38.582 --> 00:44:44.889
And you can feel their integration. That means, when you get your

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.928
Kundalini in Sahastrara, your mental, emotional,

00:44:50.129 --> 00:44:56.373
and your spiritual, everything being becomes one.

00:44:56.574 --> 00:45:00.232
Your physical being also merges into it.

00:45:00.433 --> 00:45:03.810
Then you have no problem, as to,

00:45:04.011 --> 00:45:08.577
"Yes, I love Mother. But ah I'm sorry, ah -

00:45:08.778 --> 00:45:14.215
I have to steal this money."

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:20.070
"Yes, I know, I recognize Mother, yes, I know She is great,

00:45:20.271 --> 00:45:26.310
but I can't help it I have to tell Her lies".

00:45:26.873 --> 00:45:32.094
Or, "I have to do this wrong thing, because after all,

00:45:32.295 --> 00:45:38.250
ah - I can't help it." There is no compromise with Me.

00:45:38.451 --> 00:45:40.867
It has to be completely integrated.

00:45:41.068 --> 00:45:46.289
Your Dharma should be corrected. You can not do anything wrong

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.367
and then say, "I'm a Sahaja Yogi." You cannot.

00:45:49.568 --> 00:45:53.859
But for this, the strength comes from within.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.060
Your Spirit strengthens you.

00:45:56.261 --> 00:46:01.474
You must just put in your will-power that "Yes, let my Spirit act."

00:46:01.675 --> 00:46:05.912
And then you start acting according to the Spirit.

00:46:06.113 --> 00:46:09.857
Once you start acting according to the Spirit,

00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:13.435
you find you have no slavery of anything.

00:46:13.636 --> 00:46:18.029
You become Samarth, means equal to your meanings.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:22.162
Samartha, also Samarth means powerful personality.

00:46:22.363 --> 00:46:25.303
So, you develop that powerful personality

00:46:25.504 --> 00:46:30.108
which has no temptations, which has no wrong ideas,

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:35.434
which has no catches, no problems.

00:46:37.629 --> 00:46:42.287
But people who are sneaky, sly

00:46:42.488 --> 00:46:48.060
try to try, play some tricks are really harming themselves,

00:46:48.261 --> 00:46:52.083
not Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is going to be,

00:46:52.284 --> 00:46:56.809
he has been and will be, is going to be established.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:02.457
Even if they are ten people in the boat, God is not bothered.

00:47:02.658 --> 00:47:05.840
It's only My botheration as a Mother.

00:47:06.041 --> 00:47:10.160
As a Mother, I want many people to come up in the boat.

00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:15.168
But don't try to jump back by doing all dishonest things.

00:47:15.369 --> 00:47:19.856
So, this is what it is - simple, that you are integrated.

00:47:20.057 --> 00:47:26.106
By integration, you get the power to do what you understand,

00:47:26.307 --> 00:47:32.012
and you have power to feel happy with what you understand.

00:47:32.213 --> 00:47:37.223
So, you come to a stage where you develop this Neerananda.

00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:39.770
And this Neeranand you develop

00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:45.278
when you are absolutely the Spirit.

00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:51.911
In Neerananda state there is no duality left -

00:47:52.112 --> 00:47:56.200
is Adwaita, is one personality.

00:47:56.401 --> 00:47:59.380
That is, you are complete integrated

00:47:59.581 --> 00:48:08.848
and the joy is not anymore dented - is complete.

00:48:09.168 --> 00:48:14.061
It hasn't got a happiness and a sorrow aspect,

00:48:14.262 --> 00:48:19.397
but is just Joy. The Joy is not that you laugh loud,

00:48:19.598 --> 00:48:26.702
the Joy is not that ah you you're always smiling. No,

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:31.960
Is the stillness, the quietitude within your Self,

00:48:32.161 --> 00:48:36.593
the peace of your being, of your Spirit

00:48:36.794 --> 00:48:42.804
that asserts itself into vibrations which you feel,

00:48:43.005 --> 00:48:48.789
that when you feel that peace, you feel like light of the sun,

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.281
the whole rays of that beauty spreading.

00:48:52.482 --> 00:48:55.297
But first of all we are curbed down

00:48:55.498 --> 00:49:00.875
by our own personal, selfish, stupid ideas.

00:49:01.076 --> 00:49:04.867
Throw them away! We have them because we are insecured,

00:49:05.068 --> 00:49:08.172
because we have wrong ideas, throw them away.

00:49:08.373 --> 00:49:12.961
Just stand alone, one with God.

00:49:13.162 --> 00:49:17.930
And you'll find all these fears were useless.

00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:21.477
Our cleansing is very important,

00:49:21.678 --> 00:49:26.930
and that cleansing comes only when you really practice

00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:31.834
the cleansing as told in Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:33.678 --> 00:49:38.750
The Sahastrara is the blessing of the heavens, I should say.

00:49:38.951 --> 00:49:41.945
It has worked out so well.

00:49:42.146 --> 00:49:44.859
It's very difficult to break the Sahastrara.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.461
And when I really broke it,

00:49:48.662 --> 00:49:53.102
I didn't know that it would be that successful.

00:49:53.303 --> 00:49:56.102
First, I thought is still premature

00:49:56.303 --> 00:50:02.055
because there are many Rakshasas still on the street,

00:50:02.256 --> 00:50:05.688
selling their goods; and there are many fanatics

00:50:05.889 --> 00:50:09.079
who are calling themselves by the so-called religions

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:14.227
they are following, not the real religion of the Atma.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:19.047
But, gradually it has taken its roots.

00:50:19.248 --> 00:50:23.505
Now, let this truth take its root within yourself

00:50:23.706 --> 00:50:25.471
through your Sahasrara.

00:50:25.672 --> 00:50:31.656
And once this truth becomes absolutely the light that guides you,

00:50:31.857 --> 00:50:35.836
the light that nourishes you, the light that enlightens you

00:50:36.037 --> 00:50:40.938
and gives you a personality that has the light,

00:50:41.139 --> 00:50:43.860
then only you should know that your Sahastrara

00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:47.282
is completely enlightened by your Spirit.

00:50:47.483 --> 00:50:51.169
Your face should be such that people should know

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:56.638
that there's a personality who's standing before you who is light.

00:50:56.839 --> 00:51:01.505
This is how Sahastrara is to be looked after.

00:51:01.706 --> 00:51:06.677
For looking after Sahastrara is is important that

00:51:06.878 --> 00:51:12.935
you should try to cover your head during winter time.

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:16.201
Is better to cover your head during wintertime

00:51:16.402 --> 00:51:20.724
so that there is no freezing in the brain

00:51:20.925 --> 00:51:26.912
because brain is also made of Medha, means fats,

00:51:27.113 --> 00:51:30.435
so it should not be frozen. Moreover,

00:51:30.636 --> 00:51:34.294
you should not take too much heat on your brain.

00:51:34.495 --> 00:51:37.669
To keep your brain all right, you should not sit in the sun

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:41.161
all the time as some of the Westerners do.

00:51:41.362 --> 00:51:47.557
Then your brain melts and you become a crazy person.

00:51:48.346 --> 00:51:54.442
Is a sign that a person is going out for madness -

00:51:54.643 --> 00:51:57.472
is something which I've told many a times

00:51:57.673 --> 00:52:01.488
that don't take too much heat on your head.

00:52:01.689 --> 00:52:05.683
Even if you are sitting in the sun, keep your head covered.

00:52:05.884 --> 00:52:09.399
Covering of the head is very important. But

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.027
the covering of the head should be done occasionally,

00:52:14.228 --> 00:52:18.949
not all the time because if you just put

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.243
a very heavy band around your head, then the circulation

00:52:23.444 --> 00:52:28.266
becomes poor and you may have trouble with bad circulation.

00:52:28.467 --> 00:52:36.610
So, it is an occasional opening of the head

00:52:36.811 --> 00:52:42.805
to the sun and to the moon, occasionally.

00:52:43.006 --> 00:52:48.943
Otherwise, you will sit in the moon and land up in the lunatic asylum.

00:52:50.451 --> 00:52:55.773
Anything I tell you, you must know that in Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:55.974 --> 00:52:59.679
we have not to go to anything [Ati/Adhi ?].

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.546
Even sitting in the water, some people will sit for 3 hours.

00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:07.505
I never said so. Only for ten minutes you have to sit,

00:53:07.706 --> 00:53:09.706
but with full heart.

00:53:09.907 --> 00:53:13.839
If I tell them anything, they'll go on doing it for 4 hours,

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.808
there's no need do it for ten hours.

00:53:17.009 --> 00:53:21.269
Give your body different-different types of treatments,

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.711
not all the time the same treat. The body gets bored

00:53:24.912 --> 00:53:30.758
or gets absolutely ah - overburdened.

00:53:30.959 --> 00:53:33.758
Now, if you tell somebody, "this is your mantra".

00:53:33.959 --> 00:53:37.151
All right, it is to be used till you get rid of your Chakras,

00:53:37.352 --> 00:53:39.352
finished.

00:53:39.561 --> 00:53:42.618
Lo, something, some screw is to be put here; all right;

00:53:42.819 --> 00:53:45.454
now what you do - you put the screw till it fixes,

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.655
you do not go on even when it is fixed.

00:53:47.856 --> 00:53:52.499
Are you going to screw it more and more

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.640
so that ah - the whole thing gets spoiled?

00:53:56.841 --> 00:54:01.085
Is better that use wisdom. And for this wisdom,

00:54:01.286 --> 00:54:08.671
we must know that it is Shri Ganesha or Jesus Christ

00:54:08.872 --> 00:54:12.038
who are placed on both the sides. Here is Mahaganesha,

00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:13.942
here is Jesus Christ.

00:54:14.143 --> 00:54:20.181
Both of Them help you to correct your vision,

00:54:20.382 --> 00:54:22.704
understanding and give you wisdom.

00:54:22.905 --> 00:54:27.017
So, the wisdom lies not in sticking on to something.

00:54:27.218 --> 00:54:29.486
Sahaja Yogis are not stuck-up people.

00:54:29.687 --> 00:54:33.603
If they are stuck up, they are not progressing.

00:54:33.804 --> 00:54:36.353
You are not to get stuck up with ideas

00:54:36.554 --> 00:54:38.194
and stuck up with things.

00:54:38.395 --> 00:54:42.350
You have to be all the time moving and in the movement,

00:54:42.551 --> 00:54:46.156
it doesn't mean that you should fall from somewhere

00:54:46.357 --> 00:54:49.062
and people think, "Oh, we are earning such a lot,

00:54:49.263 --> 00:54:52.010
because we are falling down." You have to ascend

00:54:52.211 --> 00:54:54.916
in your movement, not to fall.

00:54:55.117 --> 00:54:58.213
So, when you are achieving something in Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:58.414 --> 00:55:01.916
first of all you should see your health should be all right.

00:55:02.117 --> 00:55:05.213
Your mind should be normal. You should be a normal person.

00:55:05.414 --> 00:55:07.760
If you are still barking at people,

00:55:07.961 --> 00:55:09.961
then know that there's something wrong with you.

00:55:10.162 --> 00:55:14.719
Or if you are still sulking and still tantrumish

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.039
and if you are still in a bad mood,

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.320
then think you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi. You can judge yourself,

00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:27.586
if you are free like a bird then it's all right.

00:55:27.787 --> 00:55:29.874
But that doesn't mean on the road you start singing

00:55:30.075 --> 00:55:32.530
like a bird and jumping on a tree.

00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:36.155
You see, any analogy I give to a stupid man,

00:55:36.356 --> 00:55:40.827
he can behave in a very stupid way. But to a wise man,

00:55:41.028 --> 00:55:44.749
he discreetly uses it for a proper purpose.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.374
So, one has to understand, Sahaja Yoga is

00:55:48.575 --> 00:55:53.465
known by the discretion person has.

00:55:54.661 --> 00:56:00.624
Now, what happens actually that you get stuck with one thing,

00:56:00.825 --> 00:56:05.172
that is your Atma and the whole your being

00:56:05.373 --> 00:56:11.906
floats like a [SOUNDS LIKE Patangas ?] does, or ah a kite that floats,

00:56:12.107 --> 00:56:14.274
goes all over the places, everything,

00:56:14.475 --> 00:56:18.547
but you are stuck to only one thing, that is your Spirit.

00:56:18.748 --> 00:56:25.422
And, if you could really do it, genuinely and honestly,

00:56:25.623 --> 00:56:30.102
not worry too much about your money and your families

00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:35.586
and other mundane things, just don't worry about anything,

00:56:35.787 --> 00:56:38.195
you don't have to worry, just give it a bandhan.

00:56:38.396 --> 00:56:40.396
If it doesn't work out, doesn't work out, finished.

00:56:40.597 --> 00:56:45.198
What's that wrong? If it works out, well and good.

00:56:45.785 --> 00:56:49.701
Not that your desire is important, but, "Thy will be done".

00:56:49.902 --> 00:56:52.123
First you say, "Thy will be done"

00:56:52.324 --> 00:56:55.326
that it is so surprising that your wills change,

00:56:55.527 --> 00:56:59.724
your desires change and whatever you say, is done.

00:56:59.925 --> 00:57:03.763
But when this also comes up, people develop an ego;

00:57:03.964 --> 00:57:09.794
so be careful. It's all done by the Shakti and not by you,

00:57:09.995 --> 00:57:15.121
by your Atma and not by you. You have to be the Atma

00:57:15.322 --> 00:57:18.394
and once you become the Atma, you become into Akarma

00:57:18.595 --> 00:57:21.957
where you don't know that you are doing it, it just works out.

00:57:22.158 --> 00:57:26.191
You don't feel, you are not aware.

00:57:26.392 --> 00:57:30.238
I wish, after all these lectures,

00:57:30.439 --> 00:57:34.527
most of your Chakras must have been opened.

00:57:34.728 --> 00:57:42.011
But this is all My work. You have to also do some homework.

00:57:42.212 --> 00:57:47.027
And, you have to also work and see for yourself. Be alert.

00:57:47.228 --> 00:57:51.011
Try to face yourself in the mirror and see for yourself

00:57:51.212 --> 00:57:54.464
how far honest you have become.

00:57:54.665 --> 00:57:56.956
How far clean have you been.

00:57:57.157 --> 00:58:00.050
How far friendly you are in collectivity -

00:58:00.251 --> 00:58:03.073
which is a very important point in Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:03.274 --> 00:58:09.206
If you are not collective, if you are funny, if you are strange,

00:58:09.407 --> 00:58:15.125
if you cannot communicate with others, then something wrong.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:24.341
And then you should face yourself as you are and try to correct it.

00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:26.542
Because you separate yourself from yourself

00:58:26.743 --> 00:58:30.261
like I separate My sari from Myself and try to clean it.

00:58:30.462 --> 00:58:34.089
In the same way, you separate yourself from yourself

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:39.612
and try to clean it. This is the way Sahaja Yogis are going to ascend.

00:58:39.813 --> 00:58:41.813
When the Sahaja Yogis will ascend,

00:58:42.014 --> 00:58:44.391
the rest of the things also will ascend.

00:58:44.592 --> 00:58:50.618
Many Sahaja Yogis of this kind will impress so many people

00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:55.063
that they will also ascend. So, the whole thing can ascend very fast.

00:58:55.264 --> 00:58:58.688
But you people who are rising higher should try to rise

00:58:58.889 --> 00:59:01.774
higher and higher without being aware of it -

00:59:01.975 --> 00:59:05.810
that's very important.

00:59:06.889 --> 00:59:11.579
Those who are also who think that others are higher than them

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.556
are also sadly mistaken, because that's not so.

00:59:14.757 --> 00:59:16.986
It's the whole that's rising.

00:59:17.187 --> 00:59:21.634
Nobody should feel that way inferior or in anyway low

00:59:21.835 --> 00:59:25.322
or feel insulted that somebody thinks we low.

00:59:25.523 --> 00:59:29.049
Let somebody think, what does it matter, Divine doesn't think so.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:33.135
So, all these little- little things you should be careful about,

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:37.705
and otherwise it's very easy in this Krita Yuga

00:59:37.906 --> 00:59:44.228
achieve the ultimate goal of Atma Sakshatkar.

00:59:44.429 --> 00:59:48.650
I think today I have told you quite a lot about Sahastrara

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:52.830
but if you have any problem about Sahastrara you may ask Me now

00:59:53.031 --> 00:59:55.768
but only about Sahastrara and nothing else, is better

00:59:55.969 --> 01:00:00.859
to ask Me questions about Sahastrara instead of all other things.

01:00:04.923 --> 01:00:08.220
You can ask Me questions.

01:00:42.146 --> 01:00:47.240
[Hindi]

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.429
[Pergunta em Hindi]

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:53.475
This is the trouble with you. You read some nonsensical books -

01:00:53.676 --> 01:00:57.577
Samadhi, Bindu, this, that, all that. Now please forget it,

01:00:57.778 --> 01:01:01.375
please forget all these things. Sama-dhi, Samadhi means,

01:01:01.576 --> 01:01:05.594
first is the Nirvichara Samadhi. First is Nirvichara Samadhi

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:09.242
that you achieve and the Kundalini just comes out of your head.

01:01:09.443 --> 01:01:12.273
Sama-dhi means, the dhi means the buddhi.

01:01:12.474 --> 01:01:15.929
And when it has got enlightenment it means Samadhi.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.799
So first of all, the buddhi gets enlightened - I just now

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.112
I told you about that only, the first enlightenment.

01:01:22.313 --> 01:01:25.354
Now, the Bindu and this and that are higher stages.

01:01:25.555 --> 01:01:28.588
Ardha Bindu,

01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:34.440
then Bindu and then Valaya. But you should not be futuristic,

01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:37.210
 just now if you have read some book no use

01:01:37.411 --> 01:01:39.577
trying to show off that. That's not a good thing.

01:01:39.778 --> 01:01:43.694
Just try to see what you are. Why do you want to talk about

01:01:43.895 --> 01:01:46.389
things which - which do not concern at this stage?

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:50.381
Just now, supposing you are going by bullock cart,

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:52.582
why do you want to ask about the aeroplane?

01:01:52.783 --> 01:01:56.113
Just now you go by bullock cart, then you get into the train,

01:01:56.314 --> 01:01:59.972
then you get into the airplane. All right? One by one,

01:02:00.173 --> 01:02:02.456
not like this. Because you have read the book,

01:02:02.657 --> 01:02:05.651
 it's not doesn't mean that you are supposed to know everything.

01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:09.237
All these books are written by some sort of crankish fellows

01:02:09.438 --> 01:02:12.260
who have read something here and there and have put it down.

01:02:12.461 --> 01:02:15.494
But you must experience. I'm your Mother,

01:02:15.695 --> 01:02:18.229
so I don't want to give you big ideas, this and that.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:23.127
I want you to do the way we have to move. As a mother would say,

01:02:23.328 --> 01:02:26.807
"Now, this is the way you are. Now you are in the first class,

01:02:27.008 --> 01:02:30.877
so pass your first exam. Then you'll go into the second class,

01:02:31.078 --> 01:02:32.382
then pass your exam".

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:36.234
Everybody has to go that way to mature properly;

01:02:36.435 --> 01:02:39.007
there should be no immaturity in a personality.

01:02:39.208 --> 01:02:42.452
So all these books that you have read you better throw them away,

01:02:42.653 --> 01:02:45.389
there's no good. But if it is by some realized souls

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:49.116
you can keep them and think that they are higher people

01:02:49.317 --> 01:02:52.608
and we have to be at their stage.

01:02:52.809 --> 01:02:57.217
Only by reading the book you don't become those personalities, do you?

01:02:57.418 --> 01:03:01.527
[Hindi]

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.481
All such questions are there, one better than the other.

01:03:04.682 --> 01:03:08.051
I'll tell you it is such a empty thing,

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:11.270
how can you be satisfied with empty things?

01:03:11.471 --> 01:03:15.603
You haven't got anything.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:21.903
First of all achieve a state, first of all settle down,

01:03:22.104 --> 01:03:24.770
gradually you will know about it. By reading books

01:03:24.971 --> 01:03:29.635
you do not become anyway realized soul, do you?

01:03:33.151 --> 01:03:36.177
According to Mr. Poolkani all questions are of this type,

01:03:36.378 --> 01:03:39.065
they are of no use. That only means that you have read some books,

01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:42.434
that's all, finished, nothing more that. And it's true.

01:03:42.635 --> 01:03:44.635
If you have just read some books you are just coming

01:03:44.836 --> 01:03:49.104
and quoting it, no use. Gradually come up. If you are honest

01:03:49.305 --> 01:03:52.019
and if you want to have it, then come up gradually.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:57.790
Just don't try to show off anything.

01:04:02.961 --> 01:04:06.648
You better give him writing.

01:04:17.386 --> 01:04:20.810
There are request that, You please give a part of Your lecture

01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:24.066
in Hindi, because some people can not understand English.

01:04:24.267 --> 01:04:27.636
All right, you see now I've given My lecture in English.

01:04:27.837 --> 01:04:31.769
But I give My lectures in Hindi also in different places.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:36.269
Here I'm giving in English. So those who want to hear Me

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:39.121
in Hindustani can come to other programs.

01:04:39.322 --> 01:04:43.595
[Hindi]

01:04:55.012 --> 01:04:59.191
[Hindi]

01:05:06.682 --> 01:05:10.963
[Hindi]

01:05:17.401 --> 01:05:21.885
[Hindi]

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:31.089
[Hindi]

01:05:41.984 --> 01:05:45.404
[Hindi]

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:49.561
He calls it pustaki, pustaki questions, pustaki.

01:05:49.762 --> 01:05:53.131
You see it is nothing Divine, it's all pustaki. This is true.

01:05:53.332 --> 01:05:56.043
That's why I used to wonder why Kabirdas once has said,

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:59.074
"Pari pari pandita moora khabaye."

01:05:59.275 --> 01:06:02.160
Now I know why he said it, because by reading

01:06:02.361 --> 01:06:06.214
people really become funny and they just try to test Me,

01:06:06.415 --> 01:06:09.527
My knowledge, or trying to show off their own knowledge.

01:06:09.728 --> 01:06:11.094
Ka pustaki.

01:06:11.295 --> 01:06:14.317
What is relation between Kundalini, prana and astral bodies

01:06:14.518 --> 01:06:18.770
and soul, are they same in different forms?

01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:21.176
Astral body, prana...

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:23.481
Kundalini and a soul.

01:06:23.682 --> 01:06:26.795
Soul. Now this gentleman who has asked the question

01:06:26.996 --> 01:06:29.490
perhaps has come only today.

01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:32.248
Otherwise I've explained most of these things.

01:06:32.449 --> 01:06:38.113
But for your benefit I'll tell you.

01:06:38.449 --> 01:06:42.803
First is Kundalini. Kundalini is the pure desire

01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:50.570
to be one with God and this energy is placed in the sacrum bone,

01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:55.233
which is awakened when some authorized person

01:06:55.434 --> 01:07:00.225
from God can raise it.

01:07:00.426 --> 01:07:04.405
This is Kundalini, is pure desire.

01:07:04.606 --> 01:07:07.874
Now prana is the Shakti,

01:07:08.075 --> 01:07:11.851
expression of the Shakti of the right side, that is

01:07:12.052 --> 01:07:15.781
Mahasaraswati's Shakti, is created out of five elements,

01:07:15.982 --> 01:07:20.898
called prana. Astral - what - Astral body.

01:07:21.099 --> 01:07:26.429
Astral bodies are in simple Hindi language are bhoots

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:32.007
and they are the people who just come into your being

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:39.012
and take your soul out. Never try these tricks, never.

01:07:39.544 --> 01:07:42.960
These tricks are tried in America very much

01:07:43.161 --> 01:07:46.202
and I've told them not to try such tricks

01:07:46.403 --> 01:07:49.475
and horrible things are happening

01:07:49.676 --> 01:07:54.967
because a person living in Geneva had a child

01:07:55.168 --> 01:07:58.027
and in are you know English people don't keep their children

01:07:58.228 --> 01:08:02.769
sleeping with them. So the child used to sleep in another room

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:08.925
and the lady, her grandmother who was fond of this child

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:15.003
wanted to talk to the child through this astral body business.

01:08:15.204 --> 01:08:18.917
At every night she used to talk to the child.

01:08:19.118 --> 01:08:24.245
Ultimately so happened that the soul of the child

01:08:24.446 --> 01:08:27.753
which used to call out could not return back to the body

01:08:27.954 --> 01:08:32.175
and got lost and the child died.

01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:35.409
It has so many problems, astral body things have,

01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:39.565
that it is nothing but a dead soul

01:08:39.766 --> 01:08:43.284
from the left or the right can come into you

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.469
and can carry your soul outside your body

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.969
and you can be lost, you can be dead.

01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:52.594
So this is something going just the other way round

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:56.625
than the Kundalini awakening. By Kundalini awakening

01:08:56.826 --> 01:09:02.805
your prana Shakti and your Manas Shakti are integrated

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:07.766
and you become one with the Divine

01:09:07.967 --> 01:09:13.091
so your Superconsciousness is awakened.

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:18.948
[Hindi]

01:09:21.222 --> 01:09:23.559
I can feel the Kundalini reaching my head,

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.067
but I can't feel it come out and I can't feel the cool vibrations.

01:09:27.268 --> 01:09:30.864
That is good. Somebody is feeling the Kundalini on their head,

01:09:31.065 --> 01:09:34.270
that is what Kabirdas has clearly said,

01:09:34.471 --> 01:09:39.043
[SOUNDS LIKE "Shunnya shi khara bhara Anahata bajine."]

01:09:39.244 --> 01:09:45.684
So the [ANADAHATA ?] is ah is hitting the fontanel bone,

01:09:45.885 --> 01:09:48.520
but it is not coming out, that's it.

01:09:48.721 --> 01:09:51.832
Then means it has not broken the Brahmarandra, as simple as that.

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:54.033
Till it has not broken the Brahmarandra

01:09:54.234 --> 01:09:57.407
you can not feel the cool breeze, it's absolutely spontaneous,

01:09:57.608 --> 01:09:59.910
it has to work out that way. So is correct,

01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:02.863
your Brahmarandra is not broken, that is your state.

01:10:03.064 --> 01:10:06.110
So it has to break and the reason for that is something wrong

01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:10.623
with your heart. If your heart is clean it will break,

01:10:10.824 --> 01:10:14.089
if your heart is strong it will break,

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:16.745
but if you have a weak heart also it will not break,

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:19.361
if you're suffering from heart trouble it will not break.

01:10:19.562 --> 01:10:21.752
It has something to do with your heart.

01:10:21.953 --> 01:10:25.471
If you are a seeker of other things than Spirit

01:10:25.672 --> 01:10:28.309
also it may not break. So there are many reasons

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:32.528
various reasons why this Brahmarandra won't break.

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.747
But what is a reason that we have to find out -

01:10:35.948 --> 01:10:41.385
yourself, you can face yourself and find out what's the matter.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.300
Brahmarandra. We'll work it out;

01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:02.501
we'll work it out for you, all right?

01:11:02.702 --> 01:11:04.702
Sit down, doesn't matter. We'll work it out, don't you worry,

01:11:04.903 --> 01:11:08.960
it will work out. It takes sometimes little time, doesn't matter.

01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:13.898
Why should you have fear about it, just it will work out.

01:11:14.099 --> 01:11:18.375
Yes, we'll work it out. All right? It will work out.

01:11:18.576 --> 01:11:21.716
Who else, what else is there?

01:11:21.998 --> 01:11:23.998
One man says he had met Muktananda,

01:11:24.199 --> 01:11:29.769
now he finally want to be close to Sahaja Yoga meditation center (...)

01:11:38.601 --> 01:11:42.807
This Muktananda (...),

01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:46.781
Terrible fellow.

01:11:47.563 --> 01:11:49.563
There is a mantra for him.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:53.766
Who are the people of Muktananda just raise your hands please.

01:11:53.967 --> 01:11:56.375
Those who have written this letter about Muktananda -

01:11:56.576 --> 01:12:00.466
raise your hands please.

01:12:03.006 --> 01:12:06.563
So now, we'll tell you the mantra how to get rid of the problem,

01:12:06.764 --> 01:12:09.540
all right? There's a mantra for that

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:13.251
who he was in the past life and all that, I know and we know

01:12:13.452 --> 01:12:15.829
how to get rid of it. But you have to religiously do it,

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:18.311
religiously do it and you'll get rid of.

01:12:18.512 --> 01:12:21.311
I know it has it has done lot of harm to many people.

01:12:21.512 --> 01:12:25.936
But if those who are not anymore into the clutches,

01:12:26.137 --> 01:12:30.084
we can work it out, alright? So all those who are wanting

01:12:30.285 --> 01:12:33.436
to know about it you will know in our centers

01:12:33.637 --> 01:12:38.709
or if you can come on the sides I'll ask somebody to help you,

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:43.574
 all of those of that kind. Now, what else is there?

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:54.308
[Hindi]

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:02.759
[Hindi]

01:13:07.053 --> 01:13:11.287
[Hindi]

01:13:16.372 --> 01:13:19.514
Those who have not got Realization should come on this side

01:13:19.715 --> 01:13:22.225
and that side and all of them should be worked out.

01:13:22.426 --> 01:13:25.170
We have lots of Sahaja Yogis from all over the world

01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:30.652
and everybody must get Realization, no doubt about it.

01:13:37.799 --> 01:13:40.192
Physically I am fit, no heart problems.

01:13:40.393 --> 01:13:42.911
My problem is that I think too much about myself.

01:13:43.112 --> 01:13:46.520
Result is that I have become a psychic case.

01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:50.504
All right, those who are a psychic case also should come this side,

01:13:50.705 --> 01:13:54.947
I will tell them how it arises, from where, all right?

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:04.075
Kindly advise, may I practice meditation in office

01:14:04.276 --> 01:14:07.674
keeping Your photo before me?

01:14:18.816 --> 01:14:21.756
No, not in the office, you can not do meditation

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:25.084
in the office at all. You see, you have to be very careful.

01:14:25.285 --> 01:14:28.000
Actually, you see, office people are so gross

01:14:28.201 --> 01:14:30.242
and they will never understand Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:30.443 --> 01:14:33.156
So best thing is first to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:36.070
not about Me, don't even show them My photograph,

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:39.625
because it's very funny that some people who see My photograph

01:14:39.826 --> 01:14:42.670
are frightened, they can't see Me. If they are possessed

01:14:42.871 --> 01:14:46.707
they even shake before Me. So it's better not to tell them about Me,

01:14:46.908 --> 01:14:49.176
but about Sahaja Yoga, how you are health.

01:14:49.377 --> 01:14:53.020
Gradually with great care, like a nice mother

01:14:53.221 --> 01:14:56.191
you must bring them to the position

01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:58.761
where they can receive Realization.

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:02.292
And then gradually open the thing, but not in the office, please,

01:15:02.493 --> 01:15:05.690
no, not in the office. You have to do it at home

01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:10.081
and you have to do it in the group where you meet

01:15:10.282 --> 01:15:13.894
in the centers. That you must do every week,

01:15:14.095 --> 01:15:17.785
that is very important.

01:15:17.986 --> 01:15:23.785
And once a month in the ashram, once a month in the ashram.

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:28.871
Man says should one do yogic asanas and pranayams?

01:15:29.072 --> 01:15:32.629
Should one do transcendental meditation, second question?

01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:35.832
- Cha transcendental kakya?
- Transcendental meditation.

01:15:36.033 --> 01:15:37.845
- Should we do?
- TM.

01:15:38.046 --> 01:15:41.361
He's done?

01:15:41.562 --> 01:15:45.478
He's done all that?

01:15:45.679 --> 01:15:51.447
Now, about pranayama and about, I've already talked about it,

01:15:51.648 --> 01:15:52.835
but you might come now.

01:15:53.036 --> 01:15:55.804
Pranayam and all these physical exercises of Hatha Yoga

01:15:56.005 --> 01:15:59.367
now I'm already told that in Sahaja Yoga

01:15:59.568 --> 01:16:02.758
we too do some exercises, quite a lot

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:04.959
of our physical fitness sometimes,

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.568
sometimes for adjusting our Chakras and all that

01:16:07.769 --> 01:16:11.896
and for improving the bad moon you do exercises.

01:16:12.097 --> 01:16:15.263
But we have to know what Chakra is catching,

01:16:15.464 --> 01:16:20.490
 there's a science. It's not done that your throat is bad

01:16:20.691 --> 01:16:23.787
and you are doing all the asanas for the stomach.

01:16:23.988 --> 01:16:27.649
All the asanas are not done. Like taking all the medicines

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:31.126
at the same time. One is for cold, one is for heat,

01:16:31.327 --> 01:16:34.337
it's like that, all the medicines we don't take.

01:16:34.538 --> 01:16:38.532
So according to need of the person we do pranayama also

01:16:38.733 --> 01:16:41.509
we do according to the need of the person,

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:44.763
gradually we understand what is wrong with us

01:16:44.964 --> 01:16:49.990
and that's how we do the asana. Not blindfolded. First thing.

01:16:50.191 --> 01:16:55.740
Then about transcendental meditation less said the better.

01:16:55.941 --> 01:16:59.373
You have to see for yourself what others have achieved, you see.

01:16:59.574 --> 01:17:02.331
When you go to guru you must first find out

01:17:02.532 --> 01:17:05.909
how much money he takes. If he takes the money, just don't go,

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:12.883
first thing. Secondly, how does he live, what is his style of life.

01:17:13.532 --> 01:17:19.276
Thirdly what others have achieved, what is their condition.

01:17:19.477 --> 01:17:23.370
Most of the disciples of transcendental meditations

01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:26.698
are now beggars on the street.

01:17:26.899 --> 01:17:29.370
And some of them are epileptic patients,

01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:34.477
I have seen so many getting epilepsy.

01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:39.582
So if you have done transcendental meditation it is not meditation

01:17:39.783 --> 01:17:42.137
but it is anti-God thing.

01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:44.567
So you have to first neutralize yourself,

01:17:44.768 --> 01:17:46.768
come down to normal conditions

01:17:46.969 --> 01:17:49.268
and then you receive your Realization.

01:17:49.469 --> 01:17:52.440
We have a lady here who was a granddaughter of a Duke.

01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:55.659
She lost all her money and her husband was the director

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:59.339
of one of these "flying squads" that he was having.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.540
He lost all his money and became bankrupt,

01:18:01.741 --> 01:18:05.931
this lady got epilepsy, he got epilepsy, her child got epilepsy,

01:18:06.132 --> 01:18:09.033
all of them got epilepsy. They came to Sahaja Yoga

01:18:09.234 --> 01:18:13.072
when they had nothing with them. Today they are all right,

01:18:13.273 --> 01:18:17.103
all corrected and they are doing well.

01:18:17.304 --> 01:18:20.830
But we do not take a guarantee on anything

01:18:21.031 --> 01:18:24.227
because you have to also decide in your mind

01:18:24.428 --> 01:18:26.428
that you are not going to have this funny ideas

01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:29.561
because some of the TM people who come are so arrogant

01:18:29.762 --> 01:18:33.186
so egoistical, that it is impossible to manage them.

01:18:33.387 --> 01:18:36.209
So it is your need, not our need

01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:39.842
and that's how you should come to a doctor as a patient comes.

01:18:40.043 --> 01:18:45.910
Then only it will work out. Otherwise don't waste our time, please.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:54.509
That? Now all the questions are over

01:18:54.710 --> 01:19:00.842
and for the last time let us go into meditation here in this hall.

01:19:04.956 --> 01:19:10.612
