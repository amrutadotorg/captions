1
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:26,903
Tonight we had decided to talk about Creation
but our management has not been able to provide

2
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:38,843
me with a chalk and with a blackboard so,
I don’t know, I’ll try to explain it without

3
00:01:38,843 --> 00:01:39,843
drawing.

4
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:42,762
It’s a very difficult subject.

5
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:52,213
And I’ll try to make it intelligible.

6
00:01:52,213 --> 00:02:17,423
But I would request you to pay full attention
for such a difficult subject like Creation.

7
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:28,243
The greatest blessing today is that many of
you can feel the vibrations.

8
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:37,103
And not only that but you also know and realise
that they can think and they can love.

9
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,753
It’s a very big blessing.

10
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:44,413
Of course, some of you haven’t got it, but
those who have got it know that these vibrations

11
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:49,793
organise, because they raise the Kundalini,
they go to the place where it is needed, out

12
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:53,563
of compassion, to that portion where there
is deficiency.

13
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:59,533
They understand, they organise they are universal
in nature and they love.

14
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:11,642
They answer to your questions, when you ask
them some questions – you receive answer

15
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,373
from them.

16
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,843
They are living vibrations.

17
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:22,982
These vibrations are from the Divine.

18
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:36,563
This Divine is called as Brahma, Brahma Tattwa,
Principle of Divine.

19
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:50,772
We can say that the process of Creation is
an eternal process.

20
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:55,113
Means a seed becomes a tree and the tree becomes
a seed, and the seed becomes a tree, and it

21
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,192
goes on and on – it’s eternal.

22
00:03:57,192 --> 00:04:03,632
So, it cannot have a starting point and it
cannot have an ending point.

23
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:06,423
It goes on and on and on.

24
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:14,162
That’s why it can have different states
of existence, you can say, state of being.

25
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:19,093
So, the first, just the being, is Brahma,
where nothing exists.

26
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,093
We say ‘nothing’.

27
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:28,962
When we say nothing, it is a relative word:
because we do not exist, so we say ‘nothing

28
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:32,182
exists’ – it’s a relative word.

29
00:04:32,182 --> 00:04:37,542
When we are not existing, for us everything
is ‘nothing’.

30
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,542
There is something, but that is not ourselves.

31
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:45,512
And that’s why, relatively, we say it is
‘nothing’.

32
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:49,742
It’s only the word Brahma, we can say.

33
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:59,453
You can think of an energy, if you want to,
an energy-form that exists.

34
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:12,352
But the energy accumulates at a point and
forms a nucleus.

35
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:24,042
The energy that thinks, energy that is distributed,
accumulates at a point, concentrates on a

36
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:32,573
point, you can say, and this point is the
point we call as Sadashiva.

37
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:39,113
This happens because that energy desires,
thinks, organises, loves.

38
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:53,653
When it wants to create, when the desire is
felt in that energy to create, at that time

39
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:59,143
a nucleus is created.

40
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:00,783
This nucleus we call as Sadashiva.

41
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,543
This nucleus does not disappear.

42
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:07,553
You can think of a nebula.

43
00:06:07,553 --> 00:06:13,203
I mean, it is something which is all relative
you can think, you cannot think something

44
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,423
in absolute form.

45
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:19,853
So, with thinking you cannot conceptualise
the whole thing, but if you can think of a

46
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:27,683
state, where it’s just an energy and no
creation.

47
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:29,773
But not the energy of electricity, magnetism
– all these things.

48
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:37,743
Is the combination, the synthesis of all the
things which goes into laya which becomes

49
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:40,403
that, dissolves into that.

50
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:56,243
It coagulates on a point, that may be a [suitable]
word, coagulates at a point which we can call

51
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:59,243
as a nucleus.

52
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:04,373
This point we call as Sadashiva.

53
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:16,713
This Sadashiva is the Ishwara, is the God
Almighty.

54
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,073
We call it now “God” because now it has
a limitation.

55
00:07:18,073 --> 00:07:20,963
In the sense that we can call it something.

56
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:27,003
But if it is just an energy we just call it
a Brahma.

57
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:37,833
You can say like this: when the water becomes
ice, a follicle of ice is formed, you can

58
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:45,913
differentiate between the water and the ice,
but still, it’s a relative, relative understanding.

59
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:57,343
At this state God Almighty, Parameshwara,
takes its form as an identity.

60
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:04,783
That’s why we can say that it is not Brahma,
but an identity.

61
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:11,283
Identity has its aura, has its aura, we can
say, its light.

62
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:15,383
This light is the Divine Love.

63
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:26,893
It goes into various forms but Sadashiva remains
as He is.

64
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:39,783
Now, the desire to create is transferred to
the aura.

65
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:48,363
The aura is the Power of God, Shakti.

66
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:57,393
Ishwara has certain things beyond Him also
and before Him.

67
00:08:57,393 --> 00:09:06,813
God Almighty has something beyond Him that
He cannot control: one, He cannot control

68
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,463
His eternal nature.

69
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:13,423
It is His nature to be eternal, He cannot
stop it.

70
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:20,393
He will go on changing His form, it is His
nature, it just… it is His swabhava.

71
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,603
He cannot change it, His eternal nature.

72
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,603
He will be eternally.

73
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:27,832
Eternity is His temperament, His nature, He
cannot overcome that.

74
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:38,063
For example, God cannot take away your freedom
to choose the Truth.

75
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,063
He cannot.

76
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:41,543
Once He has granted, He’s not going to take
it away.

77
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:46,552
You have to choose it in all your freedom.

78
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,153
He will not force you to take it.

79
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:52,213
Many people have hopes like that – they
are sadly mistaken.

80
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:58,513
At this juncture only lies the problem of
complete destruction or complete resurrection.

81
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:04,432
It is left into the hands of human beings
to decide whether they want to accept the

82
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:09,023
Truth or if they want to follow the falsehood.

83
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,912
So, you have [been] given complete freedom
to choose.

84
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:20,203
I won’t go into the details about God Almighty,
because it’s a very subtler subject and

85
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,573
requires much more attention.

86
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:28,223
I have talked about it before to many people
and all His nature, they know that.

87
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:36,112
But He is the Witness, He is the Sakshi (witness)
in the form of a Sakshi.

88
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:37,182
What is He witnessing?

89
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:41,033
He is witnessing the Creation.

90
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:47,482
And the power that creates the Creation is
the Shakti, is His power, is His consort.

91
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:57,742
Now, for us, human beings, we don’t understand
that a wife and a husband could be that one

92
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,742
(unified).

93
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:03,583
For example, you can understand like a Sun
and a sunlight, Moon and the Moonlight – as

94
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,932
these two things are one and the same.

95
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,002
Or the meaning and the word.

96
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,573
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are one
together.

97
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:16,872
For example, you can be a father, you can
be a mother.

98
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:24,782
You can be a father, you can be a brother,
you can be a son – three things you are

99
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,023
doing together.

100
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:29,692
In the same way, you can be your Self and
your power.

101
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:35,713
You know: you and your Self and your power
are different, but you are one.

102
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:40,223
You have a power to write, but you are not
your power.

103
00:11:40,223 --> 00:11:44,033
Neither your power is your Self.

104
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:52,963
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are two
persons to be identified, but they are part

105
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:57,133
and parcel of one uniform thing known as ‘Brahma’.

106
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:06,122
But these horrible Tantrikas – again they
come round here – have spoiled the relationship

107
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:08,893
between Shiva and Shakti.

108
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:12,763
Not that they were human beings, that’s
why they established all these funny ideas

109
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:15,823
and talked about these nonsensical things.

110
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:19,903
Because they are the people who are nothing
but their sex-points.

111
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,153
They are nothing nobler than that.

112
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,843
They are very depraved and diseased and debased
people.

113
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:29,543
They suffer from such a terrible disease that
no way they can see anything else but this.

114
00:12:29,543 --> 00:12:32,213
Ashvameda has also described as something
to do with sex.

115
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:33,472
Everything they look, they see sex there.

116
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:42,982
It’s like a person, as we call it in Hindi
– [HINDI 13:00 mins] – who is wearing

117
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:47,562
the glass of sex and watching through that
life, everything becomes sex, sex, sex, they

118
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:52,013
are such debased and horrible depraved people,
even God, they are bringing to that level.

119
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:59,453
Unless and until they are bringing to that
level, they cannot exist.

120
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,513
How will they justify themselves, the way
they are?

121
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:11,663
Sex has nothing to do with Shiva and Shakti.

122
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:13,282
What is Sun and sunlight?

123
00:13:13,282 --> 00:13:17,062
Is there any sex involved there?

124
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,043
Is there nothing existing without sex for
these horrible tantrikas?

125
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:25,252
Is there no relationship that exists without
sex?

126
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:36,703
So, Shiva is the God Almighty – we should
call him as Sadashiva.

127
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:42,302
I’ll try to draw a little bit, let us see
how it works out.

128
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:45,573
Now forming into a nucleus like this.

129
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:54,472
Now, this is the remains of the nucleus, you
can say, which forms its power here into a

130
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:55,472
valaya.

131
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:57,823
How does it form?

132
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:03,893
He moves supposing backwards, you can say.

133
00:14:03,893 --> 00:14:12,363
Then what happens when he moves backwards…kara
noko (marathi: don’t do that)…this, whole

134
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:29,653
thing like this, remains here and all of this
passes, forms a shell around it and the waves

135
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:38,732
cross over and settle onto the shell – here.

136
00:14:38,732 --> 00:14:52,342
Now, this is the situation: when all inside
forms another nucleus here by concentration

137
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:55,802
– this is the Shakti.

138
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:56,802
And this is the Sadashiva.

139
00:14:56,802 --> 00:15:03,143
This is the Mahashakti, you can say ‘Adi
Shakti’ and this is the Sadashiva.

140
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:17,412
Now here, Shiva, once the Shakti forms Her
personality, or we can say, Her ego is established,

141
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:19,773
She is a different identity from Shiva.

142
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:25,622
Because the whole process is to create the
play for the witness to see.

143
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:28,532
He is the One who is going to watch the play.

144
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:31,422
She is the One who is going to create it.

145
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:40,523
So, She accumulates Her ego onto a point here
and becomes Shakti, assumes a position there.

146
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:51,013
And the first thing She does as a Shakti is
to go round in a parabolic…in a parabola

147
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,842
around Her Lord.

148
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,542
This point one must understand.

149
00:15:56,542 --> 00:16:00,502
She is a Shakti, is the Power of God.

150
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:06,042
And the whole Creation is only meant for God
Almighty to be seen.

151
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:11,002
He’s the only spectator of the play of Shakti.

152
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:15,442
And if He doesn’t like the play, for example,
He doesn’t like the way it is or the way

153
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:21,942
people are that are created, He can immediately
stop the play by closing His eyes, by denying

154
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:28,883
the play, by showing His annoyance or by His
stopper, He can just stop it.

155
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:32,312
That’s why He is also called as a destroyer.

156
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,203
But the whole thing is meant for His amusement.

157
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:39,533
And if it doesn’t give Him pleasure, He
can stop it.

158
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:45,423
That’s why the first one who must be pleased
is the One who is the spectator.

159
00:16:45,423 --> 00:17:00,633
Because of this, Shiva is garlanded by Her,
is a parabola and that’s why parabola is

160
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,523
the symbol of Adi Shakti.

161
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:11,124
This is sort of a certificate to Her, a sort
of a granting Her the varadan, as we call

162
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:14,263
it in Sanskrit language, is the varadan that
‘go ahead with your work.’

163
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:17,412
This is a sanction given to Him.

164
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:23,182
When She completes this parabola, the sanction
has been granted and that’s why She is a

165
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:24,182
parabola.

166
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:28,532
Here the question of men dominating the women
and women dominating the men does not come

167
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:30,932
in, because this is predominantly in our heads,
you see.

168
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:35,752
When we think of it, we think of men and women,
it is nothing of the kind.

169
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:37,133
It’s just complete Oneness.

170
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:41,263
Can we think of one couple which is absolutely
united with each other?

171
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:42,333
We cannot.

172
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,213
Because we are all incomplete people.

173
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:49,583
But if you could stretch your imagination
to such a point that both of them are meant

174
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:56,492
for each other only and the One who is active,
is the Adi Shakti, is only active to please

175
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:05,652
the God Almighty Who is the only spectator
of Her play and He’s to be pleased first.

176
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:11,203
So, She surrenders Herself before Him, takes
the sanction through the parabola.

177
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:14,532
Now, parabola is a very important thing.

178
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:19,983
You know that everything travels through parabola,
never in a straight line.

179
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:25,713
For example, if you love someone, our love
goes round that person and comes back to us

180
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,463
as love.

181
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:34,343
But if you hate that person, then our hatred
goes round that person and comes back to us

182
00:18:34,343 --> 00:18:37,003
as a terrible hatred.

183
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:43,493
So, the parabola is taken, but you might say
‘why a parabola?’

184
00:18:43,493 --> 00:18:47,943
The question can be: “Why should there be
a parabola and not a circle?”

185
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:55,523
The reason is: parabola is the shortest distance
to go round another point, is the shortest.

186
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:56,523
And that’s why it’s a parabola.

187
00:18:56,523 --> 00:19:06,173
It is even in our ordinary life, you will
find this happening: that whatever you do

188
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:11,213
to others, it comes back to you in some form,
whether you do good or bad.

189
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:17,823
And that’s why our karmic ideas and that
of our doing punyas are all there.

190
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,823
Because whatever we emit through us, will
come back to us.

191
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:28,283
In the same way, if you bless the whole world,
the blessings of the whole world will come

192
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:29,703
to us.

193
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:36,623
As I told you, the process is not that simple
as it can be drawn, because it’s a living

194
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:43,903
process of a big dimension but I’m just
trying to make it simpler for you to understand.

195
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:54,313
Now, this parabola, when, here now, when She
is, She goes into the motion of a parabola

196
00:19:54,313 --> 00:20:00,963
and Shiva sanctioned Her, sanctions Her – it’s
a living process, again you must understand,

197
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:04,553
it’s a living process, it’s as human as
we are.

198
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:08,433
Both of them are as human as we are, we should
say, they are thousand times more human than

199
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,433
we are.

200
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:17,323
So, here the Wife, His Consort, says that:
“I am very happy just like this.

201
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:21,813
I won’t go any further with it."

202
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:25,293
Because Creation is not an easy thing for
Her, She doesn’t want to depart from Her

203
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:26,293
Creation.

204
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:34,363
Creation is the child and She says, “I would
not like to have children now, because I will

205
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:35,363
lose you."

206
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:42,833
So, She pushes Herself towards Him and He
pushes Her back and disappears, opening out

207
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,643
from here.

208
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:50,073
Now She is in this form.

209
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:54,533
So, the beginning of the Om starts.

210
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:59,983
Parabola, first of all, gets converted into
Om.

211
00:20:59,983 --> 00:21:11,513
Then She pushes Herself down and settles down
for a while to meditate and to find out how

212
00:21:11,513 --> 00:21:13,833
She is going to work it out, we can say like
this.

213
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,523
You see, it is Her desire which must be aroused.

214
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:22,653
If Her desire is not aroused, She will not
conceive the Creation.

215
00:21:22,653 --> 00:21:24,893
So, a kalpa is spent in that.

216
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:29,013
Quite a lot of time is spent in Her own thinking
– which way She should do it.

217
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,513
She has created many universes.

218
00:21:30,513 --> 00:21:32,803
It is not one universe She has created.

219
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:36,893
She has created universes after universes
and I will show you how She has created so

220
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:37,893
many universes.

221
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,913
And some of them are still lingering on, some
of them are destroyed.

222
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:46,023
But today before us: this Universe, this Earth,
on this Earth, India and in India, Delhi,

223
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:47,923
you are sitting attending this place.

224
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:48,923
It’s like that.

225
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:53,153
So, at this moment, whatever is the thing,
is not the past, nor the future, but I’m

226
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:55,853
telling you about the present moment we are
here.

227
00:21:55,853 --> 00:22:00,283
But many universes have been created by Adi
Shakti; even before us.

228
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:02,903
And She has tried many other things also.

229
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:05,803
Ultimately She has tried this.

230
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:08,693
She has created Earth and then created us.

231
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:11,593
Now, how She has done that we’ll see later
on.

232
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:17,483
Just now let us see how She assumes her powers.

233
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:30,123
When She decides to create, She is endowed
with three powers: She has three powers of

234
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:35,383
God which are granted to Her.

235
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:39,233
By one power, first of all, is the existence,
the desire to exist, She desires to exist

236
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,453
with God.

237
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:53,413
The second power is to create and the third
power is to sustain.

238
00:22:53,413 --> 00:23:04,383
First power is existence, second is to create
and the third is the evolving power or sustenance

239
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,433
power by which gradually you sustain something
and you become something.

240
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:12,363
These are the three powers She assumes.

241
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:21,643
In short, we can say that She forms three
powers of Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

242
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:26,313
These are the three powers She assumes within
Herself.

243
00:23:26,313 --> 00:23:29,643
Now, She uses again Her parabolic systems.

244
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:35,593
You know, supposing, I have come to this house
by this way, I know this way.

245
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:36,653
Then I take that way, I know that way.

246
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,553
I know the middle way, everything.

247
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:42,913
Now, I know these three ways and I know all
about it: with that knowledge, I can do something

248
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:43,913
else.

249
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:49,173
So, She again uses Her parabolic movements.

250
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:56,754
Actually, Her three movements, of Mahakali,
Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, are all the

251
00:23:56,754 --> 00:24:00,403
time with Her, with the Adi Shakti.

252
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:04,843
She can separate them and put them into three
different channels.

253
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:09,643
She can combine them and synthesise them and
use it as a parabola – you understand this?

254
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:15,153
That’s why when we put a bandhan to you,
we say “put a parabola,” is a parabola,

255
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,213
because the vibrations are all in… all the
three powers are flowing this way.

256
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:28,613
So, we have got, you know that, three powers
– the Mahakali power you can say, I need

257
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:29,613
not write, “Mahakali power”.

258
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:34,343
By Mahakali power She desires, as I’ve told
you, is the emotional side of God, you can

259
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:35,343
say.

260
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:38,223
She represents the emotional side of God,
She desires.

261
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:41,263
Is the desire is that of God.

262
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:45,663
God Almighty, Who is the spectator, He is
the Sakshi.

263
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:50,743
And She puts that Sakshi into your heart,
She reflects that into your heart which is

264
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:55,663
kept all the time burning to watch what you
are doing.

265
00:24:55,663 --> 00:25:01,043
To see your play after your creation.

266
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:08,203
Her Mahasaraswati power, now, moves in a parabola.

267
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:23,633
She can move in any angle, 360 angles She
can move, from one point.

268
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:29,273
Sometimes, She goes round and round at a point.

269
00:25:29,273 --> 00:25:40,913
When She goes round and round at a point,
Her Mahasaraswati power can get consolidated;

270
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:43,503
you can say, it becomes dense.

271
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:48,853
You see, that’s the trouble with English
language!

272
00:25:48,853 --> 00:26:03,093
It becomes dense, it becomes so very dense
that it cracks out.

273
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:09,773
These cracks occur due to the momentum of
the movement of the Mahakali power, Mahasaraswati

274
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:10,773
power.

275
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:16,043
Because it is moving in a round and round
fashion, they also get into the momentum of

276
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:17,893
that movement, they start moving.

277
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:21,813
For example, this part starts moving, this
part starts moving, this part starts moving.

278
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:27,913
And when they start moving, they become rounds,
they lose their angularities and then they

279
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,043
become round.

280
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:36,393
Now I’m telling you, very much in short
because it’s a…they become round.

281
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:40,573
These rounds again are put into friction with
each other.

282
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:44,543
And that is how, we can say – now forget
about other universes, where other styles

283
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,673
were also created – but about this one we
can say, was created.

284
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:53,793
Now, you must all the time remember that this
Power thinks, understands, organises, loves

285
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:56,903
and is an identity.

286
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:59,103
So, She creates the Earth.

287
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:01,593
Earth is not created so easily.

288
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:10,983
Part of the Sun is removed just like this,
with the hand, you can say.

289
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:14,363
We must understand why the Sun became so cold.

290
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:22,733
Sun is, from the Sun it is removed very much
far away first, to the farthest point so that

291
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:23,813
it freezes completely.

292
00:27:23,813 --> 00:27:28,253
Also like Moon, it was taken very far away.

293
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:33,303
It just freezes completely and is then brought
near the Sun again, like a pendulum.

294
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:39,153
It is moved again towards the cold side, again
it is brought to the hot side.

295
00:27:39,153 --> 00:27:46,283
It is brought to a point, to the medium point
where Earth is made, is made – again I’m

296
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:51,153
saying, it’s not a chance of nature – is
made deliberately, habitable for human beings,

297
00:27:51,153 --> 00:27:52,913
the temperature was brought in.

298
00:27:52,913 --> 00:27:59,373
It has been done by Adi Shakti, the Mother.

299
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:05,263
She has done it deliberately, it’s not easy
to conceive of such a Mother.

300
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,013
But She has done it.

301
00:28:07,013 --> 00:28:12,523
And She brings this Earth to a point where
life can begin.

302
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:21,713
So the combination of Moon and the combination
of Sun gives you hydrogen from the Moon, oxygen

303
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:26,573
from the sun, gives you water, the freezing
and heating.

304
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:30,713
The freezing and heating gives you the water.

305
00:28:30,713 --> 00:28:36,973
In the water, when the Earth is made, spirally,
to move upward, again the heating and cooling

306
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:37,973
starts.

307
00:28:37,973 --> 00:28:48,693
By heating and cooling, life comes into being
as amino-acids.

308
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:49,693
Is done deliberately!

309
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:53,713
What I am saying: it is not done by something,
by chance.

310
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:56,463
On this also one has to think once: “How
is it?”

311
00:28:56,463 --> 00:28:57,463
It is not chance!

312
00:28:57,463 --> 00:29:03,218
If you read Du Nouy [Pierre Lecomte Du Nouy
(1883-1947)] , is a very big biologist, I

313
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:06,843
mean, I think he’s one of the greatest biologists
who has really gone into the calculations

314
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:22,193
of how much time should it take for a simple
amoeba to be created out of the matter and

315
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:27,092
he has calculated that it should take much
more time than even what we have had so far

316
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:31,403
– billions of billions of years are needed
just by chance.

317
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,933
Law of chance is there, which I don’t know
if I should tell you elaborately, but law

318
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:44,993
of chance is that, if you have in one tube
50 red pebbles and 50 white pebbles and if

319
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:51,943
you start shaking them and make them absolutely
in a chaotic order, it takes so much, so much

320
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:58,693
times shaking to make it again the same as
it is, or to bring it into order.

321
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:09,923
So, even to create an orderly living protoplasm,
a cell, would have taken much more time than

322
00:30:09,923 --> 00:30:14,353
it has taken so far: much more, many times
more, billions of billions.

323
00:30:14,353 --> 00:30:20,223
And it has taken only 5 billion years for
Earth to secede from the Moon.

324
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:23,443
And only 2 billion years for it to cool down.

325
00:30:23,443 --> 00:30:29,153
So, he says, it is beyond any understanding
– only thing that can explain it, what we

326
00:30:29,153 --> 00:30:31,263
can say, is that there is a ‘Juggler’
behind it.

327
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:36,383
And there is a Juggler, about which our great
rishis and munis know that – that Juggler

328
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:40,133
is nobody else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial
Mother.

329
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:43,943
The Primordial Father is Sadashiva and the
Primordial Mother is Adi Shakti.

330
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:47,443
And are we going to discuss about their sex?

331
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:51,853
Are we going to do that way with the tantrikas?

332
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:57,093
Is that the way to pay homage to your parents?

333
00:30:57,093 --> 00:31:01,973
We have to understand that it’s a very,
very solemn subject, we are discussing here

334
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:06,583
the sanctum sanctorium of the love of our
Primordial Parents.

335
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,243
It’s a very, very holy thing.

336
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:15,253
We are not holy people, we are yet full of
lots of greed and lust, but they are above

337
00:31:15,253 --> 00:31:16,253
everything.

338
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:19,783
So, when we are discussing them, we have to
know, we have to do it with great shraddha,

339
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:26,963
and with our head bowed before them that it
is our luck and we are very fortunate that

340
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:34,033
we have been able to learn something about
these two Primordial Parents who have brought

341
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:40,143
forth this Creation, their child.

342
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:50,943
So, one of these then again cracks and becomes
a surya-mandal, and a surya-mandala has got,

343
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:58,583
as you know, Earth and Moon and all these
things and I have told you how Earth is created.

344
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:08,673
After the Creation of Earth, first, you know
that amino-acids were formed, the vegetation

345
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:12,123
started and then the human being started.

346
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:16,653
Now, the matter, also, is a very systematic
thing.

347
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:20,933
Matter is not unsystematic, it is systematic,
but it is not organised – there is difference

348
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,104
between the two.

349
00:32:22,104 --> 00:32:24,633
The systematic things are dead, can be dead.

350
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:31,583
You can put five stones here in a systematic
manner, but they are not organised, because

351
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,643
they are not living things.

352
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:34,493
There’s a difference between the two.

353
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:37,653
So, first, the systematic things were laid
down.

354
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:47,413
Perhaps, if you know about the…Eight different
types of elements were created.

355
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:56,083
These were created and were put into proper
places through Shri Ganesha.

356
00:32:56,083 --> 00:33:08,913
You know that the carbon… carbon is in the
centre of these periodical elements that appear.

357
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:16,453
That means a element which has got one valency,
two valency, three valency and four valency,

358
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:21,543
the three are the plus ones, then you’ve
got one C, carbon, which has got four valences.

359
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:30,093
Then you have got, again, minus one, two,
three and four – is a complete eight.

360
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:37,263
Like that, the whole matter has been organised.

361
00:33:37,263 --> 00:33:44,493
To organise the matter, some deity was to
be created for that, and first deity that

362
00:33:44,493 --> 00:33:47,263
was created was that of Shri Ganesh.

363
00:33:47,263 --> 00:33:56,803
Let us see now how She created here.

364
00:33:56,803 --> 00:34:06,593
You have seen that one part of Her, which
is the Mahasaraswati, has created the matter.

365
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:10,843
Mahasaraswati has created the matter.

366
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:14,643
Now, Mahakali has to give them existence.

367
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:16,213
How do you get an existence?

368
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:20,753
Is through your sustenance or, you can say,
through your quality – whatever you are.

369
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:29,673
So, Mahakali gives that existence to those
material things, not human beings or living

370
00:34:29,673 --> 00:34:44,063
things but matter, through a deity known as
Shri Ganesh.

371
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:49,953
Mahakali…

372
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:54,253
In the heart of the Viraata, as you see, – you’ll
see Viraata also He comes in, because that

373
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:59,863
I will tell you later on – but in the heart
of Viraata, is the Primordial Being, the complete

374
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:02,972
Primordial Being, the Mahakali is settled
down.

375
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:08,703
What She does, She goes three and a half from
the heart: one up, one down like that – three

376
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:13,173
and a half times and comes to the end of the
three and a half, down-way.

377
00:35:13,173 --> 00:35:15,373
Three and a half.

378
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:17,693
Now, She comes at the end of it.

379
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:22,753
And if you put three and a half like that
and if you cut it straight, you get 7 centres

380
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,123
cut in.

381
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:36,883
Is there a drawing person who knows how to
draw?

382
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:51,043
You should start from like that, you can put
it like this.

383
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:56,213
She comes down here.

384
00:35:56,213 --> 00:36:02,393
She comes down here and from here She penetrates.

385
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:07,103
You see, She cuts at seven points here.

386
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:13,383
At this point, She creates the first deity,
little below, of Shri Ganesh.

387
00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:18,003
I mean, this is not done in one day, is not
done in one year, not done in one Yuga, it

388
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:19,583
is done in many Kalpas.

389
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:27,763
The first step is to create Shri Ganesh, this
is Her abode and She puts Shri Ganesh.

390
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:32,613
Now, he is emitting his vibrations through
all this.

391
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:36,883
He passes through all this whatever She has
created.

392
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:42,713
On this picture is settled the work of the
Mahasaraswati, you can say.

393
00:36:42,713 --> 00:36:47,282
She comes down with all Her programs like
this and She makes it.

394
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,782
And She gets joined here again.

395
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:52,453
So, Shri Ganesh emits His vibrations through
her.

396
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:57,783
First, Shri Mahakali creates Shri Ganesh and
then Mahasaraswati comes down, She creates

397
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:01,233
all these things and gets connected to Shri
Ganesh.

398
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:08,403
So, the vibrations of Shri Ganesh start flowing
through all the creation of Mahasaraswati.

399
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:17,383
Before creating all this, the complete thought
of what is going to happen in future comes

400
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:21,823
in a clear-cut vision of the Adi Shakti.

401
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,553
And She puts Her plans through.

402
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:28,933
First of all, the Mahalakshmi power comes
down and creates the Shri Ganesh.

403
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:34,023
You can understand now how important it is
that we have to be holy people.

404
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:37,423
First, She created the holiness on this Earth.

405
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:41,833
First thing, Her relationship with the child
was established, because the Creation is going

406
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:45,413
to be created in the image of Her child.

407
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:51,893
That’s why Shri Ganesh was created first.

408
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:57,282
And then from here, say, is the Adi Shakti,
the other power, Mahasaraswati, on Her way,

409
00:37:57,282 --> 00:38:00,333
She comes down and gets connected with Shri
Ganesh.

410
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:05,473
And that’s how the Shri Ganesh establishes
the relationship and emits His vibrations

411
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:06,473
through this.

412
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:10,403
Because of His vibrations passing through
the matter that She has created.

413
00:38:10,403 --> 00:38:16,443
For example, our Mother Earth: through this
passes the, you know that through it passes

414
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:17,443
the axis.

415
00:38:17,443 --> 00:38:21,933
Nobody has seen the axis, but they say, there
is an axis, from the way it moves.

416
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,383
There is a kind of an axis.

417
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:30,683
Now, this is the power of Mahakali passing
through the [axis].

418
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:35,053
We can say, it’s the power of Shri Ganesh
passing through the axis of the Mother Earth,

419
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:37,603
which has got magnetic power in it.

420
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:44,043
And that’s how, through that, it controls
its speed, its movement, and also it looks

421
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:45,043
after us.

422
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:51,393
Why don’t we think that when we put a little
seed in the soil it sprouts, automatically?

423
00:38:51,393 --> 00:38:56,753
You have seen now, many of you who have been
suffering from certain troubles and diseases,

424
00:38:56,753 --> 00:39:00,453
that the Mother Earth herself took down your
problems, She sucked them out.

425
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:07,413
It is a fact, you can see it in Sahaja Yoga,
that after realisation if you have any problem,

426
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:11,853
if your head is heavy, if you are a realised
soul, otherwise She doesn’t listen, because

427
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:17,823
you should be activated or you should be granted
a certificate from the Adi Shakti that you’re

428
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,953
a realised person, otherwise why should She
accept you?

429
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:28,323
You just put your head on the soil, put your
both the hands on the Mother Earth and you’ll

430
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:30,903
find the whole thing will be sucked out from
your forehead.

431
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:35,603
It has been done with many, even from the
legs it can take out.

432
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:40,473
Mother Earth is actually, is the Mother of
Adi Shakti, you can say.

433
00:39:40,473 --> 00:39:46,324
She is the Mother, they say, because She is
made in such a way that She takes all the

434
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:49,003
weights of the world in Herself.

435
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:52,624
She controls all the weights of the world
and She can consume all your weight.

436
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:53,624
She’s the dharaa.

437
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:58,703
Now, weight means everything that… your
weight is what we weigh in: that’s not the

438
00:39:58,703 --> 00:39:59,703
thing.

439
00:39:59,703 --> 00:40:02,403
Weight means also your sins, also your punyas.

440
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:03,403
It means everything.

441
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:07,513
If you have too many sins in you, then Mother
Earth feels hurt.

442
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:13,393
Wherever there is too much of sin, then Mother
Earth has to ask help.

443
00:40:13,393 --> 00:40:19,203
And then some other deity has to, like Vishnu
himself, has to come on this Earth to save

444
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:22,833
Her from this too much of overloading of sins
upon this Earth.

445
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:23,833
Is a fact!

446
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:26,013
It is not I’m telling you a mythical story,
is a fact.

447
00:40:26,013 --> 00:40:28,583
Which you have to verify after getting vibrations.

448
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:31,913
Before getting vibrations, you cannot find
out from the Mother Earth.

449
00:40:31,913 --> 00:40:35,243
If you want to find out some time, if you
are realised, you just stand on the Mother

450
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:38,223
Earth and ask her “Will you take away my
sins, oh Mother Earth?

451
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:39,893
Will you take away my karmas?

452
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:41,133
I have been realised."

453
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,673
Immediately, She’ll start drawing you.

454
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,673
You’ll be surprised.

455
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:45,013
You’ll feel so much lighter.

456
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:46,203
You have to use Her.

457
00:40:46,203 --> 00:40:49,683
That is how Mother Earth has been created.

458
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:56,933
But also Adi Shakti through Her Mahasaraswati
power has created the five elements.

459
00:40:56,933 --> 00:41:00,743
Before everything else, She created tanmatra
(subtle elements) as you call it, I mean,

460
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:03,513
if I go into details, it’s going to be too
much for you!

461
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:05,772
But first of all, the causal essences were
created by Her.

462
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:07,903
But if I say like this, there won’t be anything
false.

463
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:16,373
If I say that just by seeing by Her sight,
by her drushti (sight), She has created this

464
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,353
light.

465
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:24,853
Just by Her breathing, She has created air,
because Her desire is the last point.

466
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:28,013
Because She desired there should be air, She
created air.

467
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:34,533
Like that, She has, Her smell has created
the causal, gandha, which has created this

468
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,613
mother Earth.

469
00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:41,823
And it has started from Her only, from Her
desires, by Her desiring it – it was created

470
00:41:41,823 --> 00:41:46,593
for Her and that’s how it was created in
the whole Universe, which was later on made

471
00:41:46,593 --> 00:41:51,013
into Earth, Moon, Sun and all these things.

472
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:53,223
Actually, it was Her mere desire which brought
forth these.

473
00:41:53,223 --> 00:41:58,283
For us it is impossible to understand someone
like that, who, just by mere desire can create.

474
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:03,543
But when we think of somebody who is above
all the powers of the world, the One the,

475
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:06,753
who is the highest of all: She can do anything
She feels like.

476
00:42:06,753 --> 00:42:08,403
Can’t we think like that?

477
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:10,223
We cannot think of someone like that.

478
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:13,983
We think of God, who is Almighty, we call
Him, but when we talk of His mights we start

479
00:42:13,983 --> 00:42:14,983
laughing.

480
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:15,983
How can it be?

481
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:16,983
But She can do anything She wants to.

482
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:21,883
It is only Her mere desire that has brought
forth all these creations and all this things

483
00:42:21,883 --> 00:42:24,933
that you see in this world are created only
by Her desire.

484
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,493
She created akasha.

485
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:31,853
She created all these five elements, which
you know, and then She started Her another

486
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:35,093
form which we call as the Mahalakshmi form.

487
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:40,593
Before that, I think, I should tell you about
Shri Ganesha’s existence in the matter.

488
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:44,813
He acts in the matter as vibrations, as Mahasaraswati
vibrations.

489
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:49,973
They are electromagnetic vibrations, Mahasaraswati
vibrations are electromagnetic vibrations,

490
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:55,273
we can say, that electromagnetic and also
there is sound, and all these five elements

491
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,353
are expressed in that.

492
00:42:56,353 --> 00:43:06,253
You can record them – because if you take
a sulphur dioxide, for example, a sulphur

493
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:12,032
dioxide and two oxygen and one sulphur and
if you watch them properly under a very highly

494
00:43:12,032 --> 00:43:17,483
micro – you can try, I don’t know if people
have tried, but you can try to find out – and

495
00:43:17,483 --> 00:43:24,823
put it under, let’s say, a very highly developed
micro – microwave- microscope, you can say,

496
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:32,333
you can see that the oxygen things and sulphur,
– sulphur is stationary, – but these two

497
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,333
are vibrating.

498
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:36,783
They are vibrating, there’s a vibration
going between these bonds.

499
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:42,473
They can be isometric also, they can be symmetric,
they can be even, uneven and they can be expanding,

500
00:43:42,473 --> 00:43:43,743
and closing like that.

501
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,943
So, there are three types of vibrations, we
find.

502
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:50,014
And the fourth side is nothing but Shri Ganesha
himself who is controlling.

503
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:54,603
So, this we can see with our naked eyes, if
you want to see, even if you are realised

504
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:55,603
or not.

505
00:43:55,603 --> 00:43:59,633
From where do these vibrations come in the
minutest paramanu, as you call, the molecules?

506
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:05,643
In a molecule, how do you get these vibrations,
can you explain this?

507
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,883
It is so much, sukshma, parasukshma.

508
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:16,293
The powers of Ganesha are very, very subtle
and they enter into the matter and create

509
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:23,233
this kind of vibrations, which you can even
see and record, electromagnetic vibrations,

510
00:44:23,233 --> 00:44:30,133
in, even, a one small, little molecule.

511
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:37,463
So, we have in these, as I told you, into
the periodic level, periodic laws of elements,

512
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:40,553
you can find out that all the elements are
divided into eight types.

513
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,813
Just see!

514
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:46,143
How can all the elements be divided into eight
parts without somebody being there?

515
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:52,093
Can you do something without organising a
proper chart of these elements?

516
00:44:52,093 --> 00:44:54,933
Just think about it!

517
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:57,703
You see, when we challenge God, we have to
understand that in this world everything is

518
00:44:57,703 --> 00:45:03,103
so well organised, there are eight elements
spread out so well, placed so well.

519
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:08,463
And it has a particular style of behaviour
and every element is different in numbers

520
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:15,773
and protons and these numbers are very well
calculated in such a manner that the end of

521
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:22,553
it, that the last circle, that the last circle
of all the protons should be eight.

522
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:28,793
If it is not eight, if it is less than eight
then it creates a valency problem.

523
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:32,483
It is so well organised, then, even if you
study this, if there is anybody who knows

524
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:36,203
little bit of chemistry, you know, so if you
know chemistry, it’s such a wonderful thing.

525
00:45:36,203 --> 00:45:37,203
We take it for granted!

526
00:45:37,203 --> 00:45:40,282
We think it is our right to have the matter
so well organised for us!

527
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:45,423
But the valencies are all depending on such
a nice organisation of this eight protons

528
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:47,863
at the outer thing.

529
00:45:47,863 --> 00:45:49,433
This is all done through the Mahasaraswati
power.

530
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:55,313
But the vibrating force…Now see, there is
a vibrating force: this is all done through

531
00:45:55,313 --> 00:45:57,683
the, as I told you, through the Mahasaraswati
power.

532
00:45:57,683 --> 00:45:59,272
She creates.

533
00:45:59,272 --> 00:46:02,703
Now the vibrating force: He exists, matter
also exists.

534
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:03,703
It must exist.

535
00:46:03,703 --> 00:46:05,543
If it does not exist, nothing can exist.

536
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:12,973
So, the existence force is given through the
Mahakali force, which is acting through Shri

537
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:16,333
Ganesh, who is sitting at the nucleus.

538
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:20,633
He is sitting at the nucleus of every [atom].

539
00:46:20,633 --> 00:46:25,323
Can you imagine how much it must be?

540
00:46:25,323 --> 00:46:28,993
Every molecule and every atom.

541
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:30,863
You cannot understand the finiteness of it.

542
00:46:30,863 --> 00:46:34,453
Now, see, say, take one element like gold,
how many molecules it has?

543
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:35,483
Can you calculate?

544
00:46:35,483 --> 00:46:36,983
[It’s] beyond us!

545
00:46:36,983 --> 00:46:40,353
How many, you can say, atoms it has?

546
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:42,633
We just cannot calculate it.

547
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,983
And then how many Ganesha’s pictures must
be there?

548
00:46:45,983 --> 00:46:47,713
How is it achieved?

549
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:53,903
Is another thing which I will tell you if
I come in the way.

550
00:46:53,903 --> 00:47:02,153
How infinite reflections are caught into and
why there are two things like Shiva and Adi

551
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,153
Shakti?

552
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,653
The reason is it has to create an infinite
reflection.

553
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:08,913
How do you create an infinite reflection?

554
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,923
Do you know that?

555
00:47:10,923 --> 00:47:17,163
Anybody who knows physics?

556
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:21,833
If you place in the centre of two mirrors
something, then the reflections are infinite.

557
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:32,643
So, the first mirror is the Adi Shakti and
the second mirror is this Creation, and that’s

558
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:38,693
how you can get infinite reflections on this
Earth.

559
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:41,303
This is the reason why you can get infinite
reflections.

560
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:49,203
And that’s why you had to create another
one who reflects it.

561
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:54,653
And that’s why there have to be three identities,
one, the God Almighty, then Adi Shakti and

562
00:47:54,653 --> 00:47:56,133
then the whole Universe.

563
00:47:56,133 --> 00:48:00,313
It had to be that way, otherwise you cannot
create infinite reflections.

564
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:05,343
Now, somebody who has done this job must be
a very clever man, no doubt.

565
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:10,073
When human beings think that they can know
God through their buddhi, they must know,

566
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:13,573
how can you reach this Buddhi, it’s supreme.

567
00:48:13,573 --> 00:48:18,493
How much labour He has taken to create us!

568
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:28,493
After creating the matter, then He, or I should
say, His power as Mahalakshmi descends on

569
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:30,553
this Earth.

570
00:48:30,553 --> 00:48:34,693
Mahalakshmi helps in sustenance.

571
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:39,233
Sustenance means all the scanning of all these
elements.

572
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:47,743
When they create the matter, the matter is
differently created, created for different

573
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:49,113
purposes.

574
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:54,693
Now, what is the ultimate?

575
00:48:54,693 --> 00:49:00,613
The Creation has its ultimate aim is to create
human beings – this creation, just imagine!

576
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:06,483
You people are so great that for you all these
troubles have been taken.

577
00:49:06,483 --> 00:49:12,043
Such an important thing is a human being that
all these troubles are taken, – all matter,

578
00:49:12,043 --> 00:49:17,183
all, everything, is used just to create you.

579
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:18,183
This is the ultimate aim.

580
00:49:18,183 --> 00:49:24,233
Sort of a stage has to be laid down and you
come, the Sahaja Yogis come on the scene,

581
00:49:24,233 --> 00:49:26,532
you can say.

582
00:49:26,532 --> 00:49:28,663
Just the instrument of man is to be created.

583
00:49:28,663 --> 00:49:32,573
Now, why God wanted to create an instrument
of man?

584
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:41,173
Because He wanted to create an instrument
which could feel Him, which could understand

585
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:48,103
Him, which could emit, like Krishna creating
his murli (flute).

586
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:52,663
He just wanted to play through our instruments
His power.

587
00:49:52,663 --> 00:49:58,253
But He didn’t want to do it through the
dead instruments like these but through the

588
00:49:58,253 --> 00:49:59,253
living instruments.

589
00:49:59,253 --> 00:50:06,373
Supposing, if this (microphone) can understand,
can love, has a human mind, and if my voice

590
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:14,863
is passing through it like a hollow personality
then we can say that this is a realised personality.

591
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:17,613
But this is not a living being, you are a
living being.

592
00:50:17,613 --> 00:50:22,053
You are made specially with all these difficulties
for millions of years, have been worked out

593
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:26,083
so carefully, so delicately, one after another.

594
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:31,403
We have to now jump to the evolution part,
because you see, it’s a very long thing.

595
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,663
Shri Mataji: Kiti wasle (Marathi: what time
is it?)

596
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,923
Yogi: Saha wasle (six o’clock)

597
00:50:34,923 --> 00:50:40,113
So, now we have to come to the most important
part which is evolution, which we should understand,

598
00:50:40,113 --> 00:50:47,503
because we know evolution through science.

599
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:56,613
When these three forces came into being, before
creating any earth or before creating this

600
00:50:56,613 --> 00:51:04,503
universe or anything, first they had to draw
out a proper picture about it and a proper

601
00:51:04,503 --> 00:51:05,873
understanding of it, you see.

602
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:08,123
As before doing anything, say, we have to
plan out things, we have a planning commission,

603
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:11,153
first of all, we sit down with a planning
commission.

604
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:16,693
In the same way, first, they had to form a
stage where they just plan out the things.

605
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:20,012
This stage we can call it as the vaikuntha
state.

606
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:25,163
Because this (current stage) is not the earliest
state, this is created later on.

607
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:34,963
First, the planning state is known as the
vaikuntha state.

608
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:38,683
At this stage they created all the incarnations.

609
00:51:38,683 --> 00:51:44,153
Incarnations were not created after the Earth
has been created, which is a very wrong idea.

610
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:47,683
They created all the incarnations at the vaikuntha
state.

611
00:51:47,683 --> 00:51:53,483
Where you or I never existed at that time,
this Earth never existed and nothing existed

612
00:51:53,483 --> 00:51:55,603
that you see with your naked eyes now.

613
00:51:55,603 --> 00:52:01,523
But a state of existence, the first one, known
as the vaikuntha state, existed.

614
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:11,133
In that vaikuntha state the planning of the
whole Universe and the whole cosmos and all

615
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:12,253
that was decided.

616
00:52:12,253 --> 00:52:19,953
So, the first person who had to come on this
was Shiva, because without him nothing can

617
00:52:19,953 --> 00:52:25,203
exist, but where to settle Him down, because
He is to be reflected onto something.

618
00:52:25,203 --> 00:52:29,823
If Shiva has to be reflected onto someone,
you have to create a reflector.

619
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:40,253
So, they had to, first, think of the one Primordial
Being or a, one Huge Identity you can call

620
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:41,883
it, known as Viraat.

621
00:52:41,883 --> 00:52:44,423
They created Viraata.

622
00:52:44,423 --> 00:52:50,133
This will be the Viraata, this will be the
complete form of the Primordial Being.

623
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:54,623
This is the one I’m telling you about, this
Reflector, The First One.

624
00:52:54,623 --> 00:52:59,293
The God Almighty has to be reflected, so,
first, let us create, first of all, the Primordial

625
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:01,803
Being, the Viraat.

626
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:10,603
In the Viraat they created different incarnations.

627
00:53:10,603 --> 00:53:13,443
Incarnations are not created from human beings.

628
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:15,853
I don’t know why people think like that.

629
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:17,573
They cannot be created by human beings.

630
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:18,613
But they were first created.

631
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:23,743
You see, evolution is alright from amoeba
to human beings, but there is no evolution

632
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,223
for incarnations.

633
00:53:25,223 --> 00:53:30,323
They are made like that from the very beginning.

634
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:40,853
As you have seen in the Viraata, I have shown
you the picture of the Viraat, the three powers

635
00:53:40,853 --> 00:53:50,203
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati
met at the Agya Chakra, and there they produced

636
00:53:50,203 --> 00:53:58,723
two children each – it’s not a story,
is a fact, again – as brothers and sisters.

637
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:08,243
And these brothers and sister means the relationship
is of a temporary nature but of a subtler

638
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,243
temperament.

639
00:54:09,243 --> 00:54:15,383
And then they were married, inter-communication
took place.

640
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:24,233
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Mahakali created
all together six children, who were married.

641
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:26,473
Inter-marriage took place.

642
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:36,763
By that inter-marriage they got an entity
which was a kinetic personality and a potential

643
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:40,353
energy within it, such a combination.

644
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:44,103
And they placed those incarnations on different
chakras.

645
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:51,643
They brought from these, from the top, all
of them were brought from the Agya downward

646
00:54:51,643 --> 00:54:55,723
and placed onto all the chakras.

647
00:54:55,723 --> 00:55:02,483
These incarnations, as you know, are placed
on different chakras of the Viraata.

648
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:07,793
Many people won’t understand this and won’t
like to hear this also, because human beings

649
00:55:07,793 --> 00:55:14,503
are so egoistical that they cannot understand
that there is a God, Who is Almighty, Who

650
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:18,843
is going to do everything, He has His own
ways of doing it.

651
00:55:18,843 --> 00:55:23,213
Now, whether I’m telling the Truth or not,
you can verify it on vibrations.

652
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:26,883
You can see for yourself how Incarnations
were created.

653
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:32,753
And all these Incarnations were placed in
the Viraata state.

654
00:55:32,753 --> 00:55:45,673
Here, to create the reflection on the other
side, Shiva was removed from the Shakti, as

655
00:55:45,673 --> 00:55:50,933
it was removed in the beginning and it was
placed on top of the Viraata’s head as the

656
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:51,933
Sadashiva’s peetha.

657
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:53,843
In the same way, we, too, have a Sadashiva’s
peetha on our head.

658
00:55:53,843 --> 00:55:56,073
You see, we are the reflection of the reflector.

659
00:55:56,073 --> 00:56:04,653
So, we, too, have the same style, we, too,
have a Sadahsiva’s peetha on our head.

660
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,813
He’s also placed here only.

661
00:56:06,813 --> 00:56:18,282
But when the Kundalini enters into the being,
when he is in the womb of the mother, that

662
00:56:18,282 --> 00:56:25,073
time this Sadashiva peetha, or we can say,
Sadashiva from this peetha descends into the

663
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:26,473
heart.

664
00:56:26,473 --> 00:56:32,333
And that’s how you hear the first throb
in the heart.

665
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,483
It is just the same as it happened in the
Viraata.

666
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:41,403
But at the vaikuntha stage this was not created,
the second reflector here was not created,

667
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:42,963
only the first one.

668
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:52,012
So, only the Viraata was created and in His
Being, in the planning stage, first of all,

669
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:58,032
these officers, you can say, in charge of
these chakras were created by Adi Shakti.

670
00:56:58,032 --> 00:57:04,393
God is the witness and She is doing the play
and She creates those chakras.

671
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:07,183
In the chakras She places all these deities
to govern.

672
00:57:07,183 --> 00:57:19,733
Now, there is the existence, there is the
creation, creative force, and there is the

673
00:57:19,733 --> 00:57:23,233
evolutionary force – all inside the Viraata
state.

674
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:28,143
Now, this is at the vaikuntha state, we say,
because this state is on this first reflection.

675
00:57:28,143 --> 00:57:39,323
It is not in us, or we cannot feel it, the
vaikuntha state, because it is in the first

676
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:40,323
thing.

677
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,973
Then another state was created, then third
was created.

678
00:57:42,973 --> 00:57:48,023
But the fourth one is the bhavasagara, is
the state at which all of us were born.

679
00:57:48,023 --> 00:57:54,703
First, in the fourth state…now, can you
think of a four strata personality which is

680
00:57:54,703 --> 00:57:56,263
facing a mirror?

681
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:59,463
Now, which is the first one [that] shows?

682
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:00,463
Is the topmost.

683
00:58:00,463 --> 00:58:02,303
And that’s why the topmost shows is the
bhavasagara.

684
00:58:02,303 --> 00:58:07,673
But if you can go deep down into your state,
you can feel all the other three.

685
00:58:07,673 --> 00:58:10,283
But first of all, the one which you can see
and feel it, is the bhavasagara.

686
00:58:10,283 --> 00:58:12,303
So, you are born in the bhavasagara.

687
00:58:12,303 --> 00:58:15,093
At this state you are at the bhavasagara state.

688
00:58:15,093 --> 00:58:23,193
At this bhavasagara state, now, you are created
and you have to evolve.

689
00:58:23,193 --> 00:58:26,933
At this time the Mahalakshmi power acts to
evolve you.

690
00:58:26,933 --> 00:58:33,022
You already know how evolutionary things have
taken place but I will tell you how evolution

691
00:58:33,022 --> 00:58:36,532
has taken place according to our puranas (ancient
scriptures), and which is a fact.

692
00:58:36,532 --> 00:58:46,243
The Evolution of Man started, first from the
amoeba, you can say; because the life came

693
00:58:46,243 --> 00:58:49,163
into being into water, as I told you [that]
first the water was created.

694
00:58:49,163 --> 00:58:53,743
In the water the amino-acids were formed,
amoeba were formed, fishes were formed and

695
00:58:53,743 --> 00:59:00,893
fishes, when they were formed, they found,
the smaller fishes found it difficult to exist

696
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:04,623
because of the bigger fishes were trying to
eat it.

697
00:59:04,623 --> 00:59:10,053
It comes as a reciprocal thing, they were
absolutely fed up of this destruction that

698
00:59:10,053 --> 00:59:11,113
was going on.

699
00:59:11,113 --> 00:59:16,793
At this time, Shri Vishnu Himself, the One
who is the evolutionary force, descended on

700
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:20,543
this Earth as the Matsya-Avatara.

701
00:59:20,543 --> 00:59:24,323
He helped some of the fishes to cross across
the shores.

702
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:29,123
By crossing across they had that courage,
She was the leader.

703
00:59:29,123 --> 00:59:30,523
And then others started crossing across.

704
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:34,252
This was the first evolutionary stage which
we know.

705
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:38,983
These fishes became reptiles later on; as
you know, in the evolutionary stages that

706
00:59:38,983 --> 00:59:41,323
they became reptiles.

707
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:42,873
But how did they become reptiles?

708
00:59:42,873 --> 00:59:45,563
There must be someone who must have given
them the lead.

709
00:59:45,563 --> 00:59:51,613
It was again Shri Vishnu, who came on this
Earth as a Kurma and lots of things were done

710
00:59:51,613 --> 00:59:57,413
at this time in the vaikuntha stage, before
He came on this Earth as a Kurma Avatara.

711
00:59:57,413 --> 01:00:02,933
At the vaikuntha stage, when they created
this Earth, when they created, they planned

712
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:08,653
this whole Viraata and wanted to create, on
this side of the reflector the whole planning

713
01:00:08,653 --> 01:00:14,573
and the whole thinking and all that process
brought forth some sort of a waste matter.

714
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:17,813
It brought forth the waste matter.

715
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:23,023
This waste matter got contaminated or, we
can say, got stagnated on to one side which

716
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:28,195
was neglected somehow, and through it started
coming out some satanic forces and there was

717
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:32,293
a big fight between the satanic forces and
the good forces.

718
01:00:32,293 --> 01:00:36,693
It actually happened in the third stage, not
at the vaikuntha stage, but at the third stage,

719
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:40,083
because when the planning started, the working
out started, these satanic forces started

720
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,083
working out.

721
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,073
Now, people may say, “Why God created satanic
forces?”

722
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:49,753
He did not, but eventually they turned out
to be because at the second stage, when some

723
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:51,223
of the Devas, who were created.

724
01:00:51,223 --> 01:00:55,623
Again, they were not evolved people, they
were created, Devas, in charge of all these

725
01:00:55,623 --> 01:00:59,683
elements and all the working, you see, you
have to create also officers or people who

726
01:00:59,683 --> 01:01:01,423
have to go in the field and work out.

727
01:01:01,423 --> 01:01:05,703
All these Devas and Devatas: out of their
working, what happened [is] that they got

728
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,373
lost, some of them, and became satanic forces.

729
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:13,433
Sort of a waste-product came in, and with
that waste-product, satanic forces started

730
01:01:13,433 --> 01:01:20,453
and they acted in such a way that there was
a war during the Kurma-Avatara between Rakshasas

731
01:01:20,453 --> 01:01:21,813
and the Suras, as they call it.

732
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:26,093
So, the good people who were in charge of
the elements, all the working in the office

733
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:29,103
of God started fighting with the satanic forces.

734
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:36,073
At that time, He Himself worked out this and
you know what happened in the amrut-mantan

735
01:01:36,073 --> 01:01:40,623
which took place, and this is, – people
don’t understand how can the amrut-mantan

736
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:42,473
take place in the bhavasagara, – it did
not.

737
01:01:42,473 --> 01:01:47,843
It took place at a stage which is not bhavasagara.

738
01:01:47,843 --> 01:01:50,173
At the bhavasagara it did not take place.

739
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,993
Now, we are at the bhavasagara state.

740
01:01:52,993 --> 01:01:56,736
At the bhavasagara state the same Kurma, the
same one took birth and came on this Earth

741
01:01:56,736 --> 01:02:00,603
and gave us a understanding how to become
a proper reptile.

742
01:02:00,603 --> 01:02:01,923
Like that we grew up.

743
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:05,123
So, the whole thing will take too much time,
I need not go into that.

744
01:02:05,123 --> 01:02:07,373
But, ultimately, a human being was created.

745
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:12,843
All this is done by Mahalakshmi power, which
has acted through Vishnu, which I have told

746
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:20,673
you how evolution has taken place, how you
are made.

747
01:02:20,673 --> 01:02:22,853
Now, what is going to happen?

748
01:02:22,853 --> 01:02:25,413
You reach this point, up to this point, till
Christ came in.

749
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:29,553
Christ was also an incarnation and his Mother
was nobody else but Radhaji Herself, the Mahalakshmi.

750
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:33,043
And they brought forth up to this stage the
human beings.

751
01:02:33,043 --> 01:02:36,012
After this, now, what man has to become?

752
01:02:36,012 --> 01:02:44,083
– is to enter into a state where he becomes
nirvichar, means there is no more the consciousness

753
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:47,423
of the bhavasagara, but you go little beyond
it.

754
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:57,383
From this stage you dive into a state of Universal
Unconscious, as they call it, it’s nothing

755
01:02:57,383 --> 01:03:01,613
but the same power which exists here, which
is a synthesis of all the three powers, is

756
01:03:01,613 --> 01:03:03,613
the synthesis of all the three powers.

757
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,073
That is the Adi Shakti’s power.

758
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:09,883
Adi Shakti’s power is all-pervading, exists
everywhere, but we never feel it otherwise.

759
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:10,883
Why?

760
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:12,293
Because we are very grossly placed.

761
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:18,083
We can say, that a tube, which has got, say
four layers, out of which it can only use

762
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:22,423
the outer tube, because the inner tubes are
all closed.

763
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:27,522
When the innermost tube is opened out, you
become absolutely Self-realised, but when

764
01:03:27,522 --> 01:03:31,933
even the second tube is opened out, you can
feel the all-pervading force of God Almighty,

765
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:36,073
which is, we call it as Sampovapi achetan.

766
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:40,522
But it is no more achetan (unconscious) for
you because you are conscious of it.

767
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:43,022
That is how you start your dialogue with God.

768
01:03:43,022 --> 01:03:48,022
What happens is that here, the reflection
here, the reflector, that is reflecting work,

769
01:03:48,022 --> 01:03:50,603
from here you ascend into this part.

770
01:03:50,603 --> 01:03:53,193
You ascend onto this part.

771
01:03:53,193 --> 01:03:57,733
You do not become this but you ascend into
this area.

772
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,313
From here you ascend into this area.

773
01:04:00,313 --> 01:04:07,183
And this area is filled with the all-pervading
power of Adi Shakti.

774
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:12,893
Till you reach to this stage, you have to
go up to this stage of an incarnation, which,

775
01:04:12,893 --> 01:04:14,423
of course, is a big gap.

776
01:04:14,423 --> 01:04:20,183
But I can say that Mahavira and Buddha, both
of them rose to that height.

777
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:21,243
But look at their disciples!

778
01:04:21,243 --> 01:04:25,073
For example, Buddha’s disciples, they have
decried Shiva, they have decried all the Gods

779
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:27,583
and Goddesses, I mean as if they did not know
much about it.

780
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:33,793
And the way they have shown in certain statues
– that a Goddess is standing on top of a

781
01:04:33,793 --> 01:04:37,923
Shiva and a Parvati and is trying to kill;
She is hitting Shri Ganesha and this is something

782
01:04:37,923 --> 01:04:38,923
so non-sensical.

783
01:04:38,923 --> 01:04:44,333
I mean, they completely killed the image of
One United Force, acting the whole thing,

784
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,693
in One united idea, with One united mind.

785
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:51,643
Only whenever they had not united, they became
Rakshasas and formed the satanic force.

786
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:55,963
As I told you it’s a very, very difficult
subject and I’ve tried to handle it in English,

787
01:04:55,963 --> 01:04:56,963
is even worse.

788
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,413
So, I’ve tried my level best to do it, but
still if you have any questions, anything,

789
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:05,083
you can ask me, some time, you can write to
me, we can find it out.

790
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:08,863
For tomorrow…Now, this is the only thing
is, I wanted to tell you about this, that

791
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,323
now you have got thoughtless awareness, no
doubt.

792
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:14,413
Most of you have got thoughtless awareness,
you have got vibrations, but you have to jump

793
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:15,413
into Nirvikalpa.

794
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:16,413
Nirvikalpa.

795
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:20,002
And [to] that you have to jump through deep
meditation and through deep exposure.

796
01:05:20,002 --> 01:05:24,823
Otherwise, you see, it is no use only having
this little state of Nirvichara, you have

797
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:25,823
to jump into Nirvikalpa.

798
01:05:25,823 --> 01:05:30,823
That is a stage, little, as I’ve told you
here, that a little ahead of this reflector,

799
01:05:30,823 --> 01:05:31,823
you have moved.

800
01:05:31,823 --> 01:05:34,123
But still you are going up and down, so many
of you.

801
01:05:34,123 --> 01:05:38,734
This is a state known as satori in the Zen
system of religion, they call it as satori:

802
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:41,123
where, you see, if a person is going up and
down, is catching, doing this, that.

803
01:05:41,123 --> 01:05:42,752
This stage has to be overcome.

804
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:45,783
Then you go to the Nirvikalpa state.

805
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:47,573
At the end of the Nirvikalpa state you just
don’t catch much.

806
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:49,033
You are not bothered.

807
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:52,593
So far, I haven’t met any human being like
that.

808
01:05:52,593 --> 01:05:59,183
You see, I have seen very great saints and
realised people and I can say that they are

809
01:05:59,183 --> 01:06:04,373
definitely Self-realised, they are even controlling
nature, some of them do, but still they catch

810
01:06:04,373 --> 01:06:06,553
on their chakras, is something surprising.

811
01:06:06,553 --> 01:06:11,473
But, you see, human beings are like that,
they’ll go on catching and again, perhaps,

812
01:06:11,473 --> 01:06:15,743
they jump into the third state of Self-realisation
completely, but they are again in a satori

813
01:06:15,743 --> 01:06:18,223
state and they come back and go back and,
like that, may be.

814
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:22,913
But I have seen that, so far, I have not met
one human being whom I will say he is fully

815
01:06:22,913 --> 01:06:24,843
Self-realised, who doesn’t catch.

816
01:06:24,843 --> 01:06:29,003
Except for me, I find, everybody is catching.

817
01:06:29,003 --> 01:06:31,343
It’s most surprising.

818
01:06:31,343 --> 01:06:34,243
But when you don’t catch – what happens,
when you don’t catch?

819
01:06:34,243 --> 01:06:36,183
Actually, this is a state rather difficult
to achieve.

820
01:06:36,183 --> 01:06:42,403
But if you don’t catch, if you think you
don’t catch – how you should do it ?- is

821
01:06:42,403 --> 01:06:45,883
to see this way: that if, supposing, you are
catching Agya, maybe.

822
01:06:45,883 --> 01:06:49,853
You must know that when you are catching your
Agya, you should not think you are catching

823
01:06:49,853 --> 01:06:53,883
your Agya, but you should think that you are
gathering a force here to combat the another

824
01:06:53,883 --> 01:06:54,883
person.

825
01:06:54,883 --> 01:06:55,883
If you can do like that.

826
01:06:55,883 --> 01:07:00,593
Supposing you are catching on the Vishuddhi
chakra, instead of thinking that you are catching

827
01:07:00,593 --> 01:07:04,933
on Vishuddhi chakra and getting upset about
it, if you start thinking that this is a force

828
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,903
you are accumulating just to counterbalance
his Vishuddhi chakra.

829
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,883
Then, I think, it will work out better.

830
01:07:10,883 --> 01:07:15,373
That’s why I always say that: extend your
hands to others and see for yourself.

831
01:07:15,373 --> 01:07:19,022
This has helped many people because if they
catch on Agya and if they give vibrations

832
01:07:19,022 --> 01:07:20,453
to somebody who is Agya caught, they find
they are released.

833
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,623
Such things are happening to very few but
it’s happening.

834
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:27,363
So, this is what you can try: that don’t
think you are catching but you should think:

835
01:07:27,363 --> 01:07:31,553
a force has been accumulated to expel the
Agya of another person who is facing you.

836
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:35,003
In the beginning, of course, it’s a very,
very slow process, but gradually you can do

837
01:07:35,003 --> 01:07:38,113
it and only people who start giving others.

838
01:07:38,113 --> 01:07:41,993
This is a collective thinking, is a collective
thinking: that, supposing, now you can say

839
01:07:41,993 --> 01:07:47,133
like that, that if, supposing, there is a
malaria attack on Me, then My own blood, My

840
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:49,853
own blood cells are trying to combat it.

841
01:07:49,853 --> 01:07:50,893
And they are combating it.

842
01:07:50,893 --> 01:07:54,022
You see, if I give in, if I give in, then
I become malarious.

843
01:07:54,022 --> 01:07:55,843
But if I do not give in, I become victorious.

844
01:07:55,843 --> 01:08:01,993
In the same way, if you could think this way
while giving vibrations: that if you catch

845
01:08:01,993 --> 01:08:06,502
it is actually a force being accumulated into
you and then you have to give it, then you

846
01:08:06,502 --> 01:08:09,913
are going to be much faster than all the munis
put together, I can tell you.

847
01:08:09,913 --> 01:08:13,133
But that thinking is rather difficult for
human beings, because once they catch, they

848
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:15,923
get little worried, “I’m catching,”
they start taking out their own.

849
01:08:15,923 --> 01:08:19,933
If you don’t take out your own and go all
out to give it to others, it will work out

850
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:20,933
better.

851
01:08:20,933 --> 01:08:24,383
And this I’ve been, I’ve experimented
with one or two people, I’m saying, and

852
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:25,383
it has worked.

853
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:26,463
Everybody does not have that capacity.

854
01:08:26,463 --> 01:08:30,613
So, gradually you rise, because you are just
now newly born children, you have still to

855
01:08:30,613 --> 01:08:33,383
grow, you have to grow more.

856
01:08:33,383 --> 01:08:36,693
You might be learned, you might be knowing
a lot, that doesn’t mean, as far as your

857
01:08:36,693 --> 01:08:39,473
spirituality is concerned, you have just have
come out of your satori state, some of you,

858
01:08:39,473 --> 01:08:41,643
and some of you are still in the satori state.

859
01:08:41,643 --> 01:08:43,893
So, be careful about it.

860
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:47,833
I would like to meet you again, perhaps, after
two years, I don’t know when.

861
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,793
Tomorrow we are having a meditation here,
then I won’t speak much.

862
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,223
Tomorrow we have a meditation.

863
01:08:52,223 --> 01:08:57,203
We have a meditation centre here, where you
should go and meet, when you meet in a group

864
01:08:57,203 --> 01:09:03,073
then it is a samuhik, is a group activity,
I will be there.

865
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:08,793
You’ll be surprised that my vibrations cannot
be felt anywhere so much as they can be felt

866
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:12,153
in a group, about which I know that such and
such group is working here.

867
01:09:12,153 --> 01:09:15,253
So, we have already three groups which are
working in Delhi.

868
01:09:15,253 --> 01:09:17,373
And they are made quite closer to the places.

869
01:09:17,373 --> 01:09:20,723
After all, we must know that we don’t have
to go to Himalayas, as people went down, we

870
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:21,853
don’t have to do all these things.

871
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:25,613
Only thing we have to go is to a place which
is very much closer to us, it has been brought

872
01:09:25,613 --> 01:09:26,983
to our doors.

873
01:09:26,983 --> 01:09:33,283
The whole thing has been brought to your doors:
the knowledge, the vibrations, the realisation

874
01:09:33,283 --> 01:09:34,593
and everything is made so easy.

875
01:09:34,593 --> 01:09:35,593
It’s made easy….

876
01:09:35,593 --> 01:09:38,272
But it should not mean that we should take
it for granted.

877
01:09:38,272 --> 01:09:43,002
It has been made easy through a very, very
great tapasya on my part, I should say.

878
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:46,752
In many ages I’ve been living now for thousands
of years and I’ve been working it out on

879
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:51,853
so many human beings and so many things and,
at long last, I’ve been able to find out

880
01:09:51,853 --> 01:09:55,493
most of the permutations and combinations
of most of the human beings and that’s how

881
01:09:55,493 --> 01:09:58,022
it has been worked out in such a large mass-scale.

882
01:09:58,022 --> 01:10:01,583
It would not have been possible if I had not
worked it out in that way.

883
01:10:01,583 --> 01:10:05,873
And that’s how if it has worked out it has
to click with most of the people except for

884
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:12,123
one type is very, very difficult, I must say,
those who are bound to people who are rakshasas.

885
01:10:12,123 --> 01:10:15,482
If they are born rakshasas and if your head
has touched their feet, it’s a very difficult

886
01:10:15,482 --> 01:10:16,482
thing.

887
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:18,652
So, I would warn you, that before you touch
feet of anybody, you’d be careful about

888
01:10:18,652 --> 01:10:19,652
it.

889
01:10:19,652 --> 01:10:20,652
May God bless you all!

890
01:10:20,652 --> 01:10:24,933
It’s already very late for all of you and
such a difficult subject to be brought to

891
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:28,033
such a short time, it’s very difficult.

892
01:10:28,033 --> 01:10:32,693
I hope to write some book on Sahaja Yoga:
‘I hope’, I am saying, because, so far,

893
01:10:32,693 --> 01:10:33,772
I’ve never written any book.

894
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:36,613
[I’m] trying to write some book, but before
that some other people are writing.

895
01:10:36,613 --> 01:10:39,583
I hope, I may be able to write something.

896
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:43,103
In any case, you try not to bother too much
about these things.

897
01:10:43,103 --> 01:10:47,543
This is not so important as your own realisation
and your own ascent [because] the whole knowledge

898
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:48,692
will be dawned upon you.

899
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:50,393
You don’t have to bother!

900
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:53,393
Every word now you read, you will have a meaning
about it and you will understand.

901
01:10:53,393 --> 01:10:57,333
The first thing is that you must get your
realisation, second thing is you must ascend.

902
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,643
You must ascend much more and give more time
to this.

903
01:11:00,643 --> 01:11:02,073
Do not take it for granted.

904
01:11:02,073 --> 01:11:04,343
It is a very important thing which you should
do.

905
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,632
After all there are other things, they are
important.

906
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:09,483
But this is the most important thing which
has to be done.

907
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:13,143
By God’s grace, if it works out I’ll be
very happy.

908
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:18,723
As it is, I’m extremely happy because in
none of my lives I’ve been able to give

909
01:11:18,723 --> 01:11:20,793
realisations to so many people.

910
01:11:20,793 --> 01:11:23,123
So as it is, I am over-satisfied with Myself.

911
01:11:23,123 --> 01:11:26,853
But as far as you are concerned, you should
not be satisfied, you should ask for more

912
01:11:26,853 --> 01:11:29,603
and more and more and it will be granted.

913
01:11:29,603 --> 01:11:32,353
Because you are the people who are on the
stage, you are created for this purpose.

914
01:11:32,353 --> 01:11:34,003
One has to do it.

915
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:36,112
God has to do it.

916
01:11:36,112 --> 01:11:39,323
If He does not do it, He cannot fulfil His
own desires.

917
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:42,543
And His Creation, He is not going to destroy.

918
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,793
May God bless you!
