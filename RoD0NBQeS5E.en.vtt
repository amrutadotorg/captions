00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.280
This day for us to remember that Christ was born on this earth.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.520
As a human being, He came on this earth.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.002
And the task that was before Him

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:20.342
was to enlighten human awareness

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:29.012
with the sense of understanding,

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:32.172
but we can say it is actualization,

00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:36.612
within the awareness of human beings,

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:43.572
that they are not this body but they are the spirit.

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:48.852
The message of Christ is His resurrection.

00:00:49.652 --> 00:00:55.092
That is you are your spirit and not your body.

00:00:56.892 --> 00:01:00.892
And He showed by His resurrection,

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:08.972
how He ascended into the realm of spirit – which He was,

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:16.052
because He was Pranava, He was Brahma, He was Mahavishnu –

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:21.612
as I have told you about His birth.

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:35.692
And when He came on this earth, in a body, like a human being,

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:39.932
He wanted to show another thing

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:44.732
that spirit has nothing to do with money,

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:48.932
has nothing to do with power.

00:01:51.972 --> 00:02:04.052
It is all powerful, all pervading, but He’s born in a stable,

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:19.012
not in a palace or to a king

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:25.892
but He was born to a very ordinary person, a carpenter.

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:41.852
Because if you are the king, as we say in Hindi language, Badshah

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:47.612
then nothing is greater than you, isn’t it? It means simply that.

00:02:47.972 --> 00:02:52.652
Nothing is higher than you, neither anything can decorate you,

00:02:52.852 --> 00:02:56.852
because whatever you are, you are at the highest.

00:02:57.492 --> 00:03:06.972
All the worldly things so called, are just like dry grass, Trinavat.

00:03:07.372 --> 00:03:12.932
So He was kept in the dried grass.

00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:20.572
To many it makes very unhappy and they feel very sorry,

00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:26.212
that Christ, the one who came to save us,

00:03:26.452 --> 00:03:30.132
was kept under such conditions and why not God provided Him with

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:35.932
something better? But to such people it does not matter:

00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:41.452
whether you are lying in the dried grass or in the stable

00:03:41.652 --> 00:03:45.572
or in the palaces, everything is just the same

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:49.492
for it does not touch them, they are so detached

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:55.212
and they are completely in joy. They are the masters of themselves –

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:59.412
nothing can master them.

00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:04.292
No matter can master them, no comfort can master them.

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:09.732
They are masters of complete comforts within themselves,

00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:12.372
they have achieved all the comforts within themselves,

00:04:12.572 --> 00:04:15.252
they are satisfied people.

00:04:15.932 --> 00:04:19.012
That’s why they are kings, they are called as kings,

00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:24.132
not those kings who run after things,

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:27.372
or those kings who seek comforts in life.

00:04:27.572 --> 00:04:30.612
I mean if you have comforts well and good.

00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:36.492
If you don’t have well and good, makes no difference.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.732
So many people, specially in Latin America when I went there,

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:44.892
they said, “but we can’t understand why

00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:48.292
Christ was born as a poor man.”

00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:51.332
This is again the human concept about God is,

00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:57.012
you see he wants to command God, be born in a King’s palace.

00:04:57.212 --> 00:05:04.012
You cannot order Him about. We have our own concepts about God that,

00:05:04.212 --> 00:05:07.612
“why should He be a poor man; why should He be helpless?”

00:05:07.812 --> 00:05:10.212
He never showed His helplessness.

00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:13.892
He was much more dynamic than all your kings and all your

00:05:14.092 --> 00:05:18.092
politicians put together. He was not afraid of anyone.

00:05:18.932 --> 00:05:21.452
Whatever He had to say He said it.

00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:27.932
He was not afraid of crucifixion or any such “punishment” so called.

00:05:28.572 --> 00:05:31.012
It’s only the human beings. you see,

00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:34.252
who have these false ideas about life

00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:38.492
and that’s why they want to put these ideas onto God also

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:43.492
and try to make Him follow their own concepts.

00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:50.652
God is not your concept. He’s not a concept at all.

00:05:52.812 --> 00:05:56.692
To also say that “Concept is after all is a concept”

00:05:56.892 --> 00:06:00.892
is also a concept – this I found out very recently.

00:06:01.212 --> 00:06:04.212
This is another myth people carry.

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:08.692
Those who say, that “Oh, concept is a concept! All right?

00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:11.332
Mataji says, all right.” So what?

00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:19.572
But even this is a concept, because concept is thought.

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:23.532
You have to rise beyond thought at a higher level

00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:30.172
into thoughtless awareness where you are not in thought but you are

00:06:30.372 --> 00:06:32.932
in the center of the thought.

00:06:33.172 --> 00:06:36.172
In the sense that one thought rises and falls

00:06:36.372 --> 00:06:39.332
and there is a place in between, another thought rises and fall.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:45.292
You are in the center of these thoughts. The Vilamba as we call it.

00:06:45.492 --> 00:06:53.412
The time where you pause. Then you will understand Christ.

00:06:55.572 --> 00:07:01.332
He was here, partly of course to save us,

00:07:01.732 --> 00:07:04.132
because He had many aspects I should say,

00:07:04.332 --> 00:07:08.332
not only to save human beings He came on this earth.

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:12.652
There were many more aspects,

00:07:12.852 --> 00:07:16.532
this is also human beings have a demand, you see

00:07:16.732 --> 00:07:22.412
that that they must be saved, why?

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:26.332
One shouldn’t. I Mean from God’s angle if you see,

00:07:26.572 --> 00:07:29.572
why should they be saved all of them?

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:33.892
What have they done for God?

00:07:34.892 --> 00:07:38.812
How can you demand God that “You must save us?”

00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:46.452
Can you? You cannot ask for that.

00:07:48.652 --> 00:07:58.892
So He did come to create the passage between as you see here,

00:07:59.252 --> 00:08:05.892
the Vishudhi and the Sahastrara, this Agnya.

00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:12.052
In the primordial being the Virat – He was born there,

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.492
to open that door.

00:08:17.252 --> 00:08:22.932
In evolution, every incarnation has come on this earth

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:29.652
to open a particular door within us and to create

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:35.852
that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness.

00:08:36.092 --> 00:08:43.052
So Christ came precisely for opening this small little door,

00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:49.092
which is constricted by our ego and superego.

00:08:49.372 --> 00:08:57.172
Ego and superego are the two byproducts of our thought process.

00:08:57.492 --> 00:09:02.092
One the thoughts, that are of the past and the other,

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.372
thoughts of the future.

00:09:04.612 --> 00:09:12.412
He came to make that gap, to cross that gap,

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:25.732
and that’s how He has sacrificed Himself, His body.

00:09:30.092 --> 00:09:40.452
For you it is a very big thing of remorse and repentance,

00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:47.372
but for such people it is not, it’s a play.

00:09:47.732 --> 00:09:51.732
They have to play a certain role.

00:09:51.932 --> 00:09:54.732
That’s why I do not understand why do you show Him to be

00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:56.852
such a lanky, panky, miserable creature.

00:09:57.052 --> 00:10:01.452
He was never miserable.

00:10:01.812 --> 00:10:04.052
Such people can never be miserable as you are.

00:10:04.252 --> 00:10:08.252
This is another concept of man, that He should be lanky, panky,

00:10:08.452 --> 00:10:16.412
tally, skinny, starved, bones coming out, count them one by one.

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:20.612
Horrible! I tell you.

00:10:21.772 --> 00:10:27.372
From His childhood to His death He was jolly person,

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:35.412
He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy,

00:10:35.692 --> 00:10:38.572
to give you the

00:10:38.772 --> 00:10:43.972
light of happiness by enlightening your source of joy,

00:10:44.212 --> 00:10:46.612
that is your spirit in your heart.

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:52.012
That He came on this earth – not only to save you –

00:10:52.212 --> 00:10:56.692
first to give you happiness, to give you joy.

00:10:56.892 --> 00:11:02.292
Because human beings in their ignorance and in this tomfoolery,

00:11:02.572 --> 00:11:07.052
are unnecessarily beating themselves and destroying themselves.

00:11:07.412 --> 00:11:13.452
When nobody asked you to go to pubs to get into trouble;

00:11:14.172 --> 00:11:18.172
nobody has asked you to go to races and become bankrupts;

00:11:18.572 --> 00:11:24.052
nobody has asked you to go to horrible gurus and get into troubles.

00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:27.572
But you seek your destruction morning till evening.

00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:35.652
Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy.

00:11:37.452 --> 00:11:42.772
First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child.

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:44.932
You see any child at least I know Myself,

00:11:45.132 --> 00:11:47.692
I don’t know about the funny people here I mean,

00:11:47.892 --> 00:11:50.092
for them flowers also look like thorns,

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.852
I mean I don’t know how they manage that stuff.

00:11:53.092 --> 00:11:56.052
But you see a child anywhere, any child,

00:11:56.332 --> 00:11:58.772
such a joy giving thing it is.

00:11:58.972 --> 00:12:02.972
And this is the child of the divine –

00:12:03.332 --> 00:12:07.332
that comes on this earth as a child –

00:12:08.132 --> 00:12:11.332
is the most joy giving thing.

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:16.372
And that’s why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe

00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:22.772
should be a festival of great joy.

00:12:23.212 --> 00:12:29.972
For He brought light for us by which you could see

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:35.052
that there is someone called as “God.”

00:12:35.252 --> 00:12:39.212
There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance.

00:12:39.412 --> 00:12:43.412
This was the first beginning.

00:12:50.332 --> 00:12:55.732
So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy

00:12:55.932 --> 00:13:03.452
and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take.

00:13:04.532 --> 00:13:09.332
Because divine life doesn’t make you serious.

00:13:09.532 --> 00:13:15.332
Because it’s all a play, it’s a maya.

00:13:17.852 --> 00:13:23.692
I have seen in all the rituals that people follow,

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:26.052
in all the so called religious people,

00:13:26.252 --> 00:13:29.612
they are too serious to be religious.

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:33.092
And religious person is bubbling with laughter.

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:36.092
He doesn’t know how to hide his joy.

00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:41.332
And he doesn’t know how to control his laughter when he sees people

00:13:41.532 --> 00:13:43.532
who are unnecessarily serious.

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:46.652
I mean nobody’s dead. The way they people say it,

00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:49.492
it’s sometimes, you just don’t know what to do with yourself.

00:13:49.772 --> 00:13:52.172
You just can’t control.

00:13:52.372 --> 00:13:56.252
So there’s nothing in this world for a person like Christ

00:13:56.452 --> 00:13:58.132
to feel sad about.

00:13:58.332 --> 00:14:00.132
And if you really believe in Him,

00:14:00.332 --> 00:14:04.332
then please first of all give up your, this silly sadness

00:14:05.612 --> 00:14:10.812
and sulking and sitting down and becoming morose,

00:14:11.012 --> 00:14:16.492
not talking to anyone, silent bores allover.

00:14:17.092 --> 00:14:19.292
That is not the way to look at Christ.

00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:22.172
See how He went and talked to multitudes,

00:14:22.372 --> 00:14:30.412
how He opened His hands to all the people around

00:14:30.772 --> 00:14:36.372
and how He tried to give them happiness.

00:14:37.452 --> 00:14:41.812
He has said that you are to be born again.

00:14:42.012 --> 00:14:46.012
That means, He had to do this work

00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:47.772
and that you have to get it

00:14:47.972 --> 00:14:53.052
sometime He had promised that you are to be born again.

00:14:53.812 --> 00:14:56.452
Christ is to be born within us.

00:14:56.692 --> 00:15:00.652
I don’t know what Christians understand out of this.

00:15:00.852 --> 00:15:03.412
How do you become born again?

00:15:03.612 --> 00:15:06.492
Not by going through a ritual of christening,

00:15:06.692 --> 00:15:09.172
somebody coming from a theological college

00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:11.052
cannot make you a Christian.

00:15:11.252 --> 00:15:16.332
Like in our India we have some paid Brahmins,

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:19.612
as you have here paid people you see,

00:15:19.972 --> 00:15:23.332
the whole day they will eat, drink, be merry and evening time

00:15:23.532 --> 00:15:27.532
they’ll come and pray and preach, that sort of people.

00:15:28.572 --> 00:15:35.612
You have to be a person who is authorized by God.

00:15:36.052 --> 00:15:42.172
Unless and until you are authorized by God, you cannot give joy.

00:15:42.372 --> 00:15:45.092
And that’s why I’ve seen all these people the so called…

00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:50.732
big pundits and the big… priests

00:15:50.932 --> 00:15:56.532
and all of them are so serious because they are not authorized by God.

00:15:59.972 --> 00:16:03.292
Even on a Christmas day, I mean anybody who comes from a village

00:16:03.492 --> 00:16:07.492
may think there’s a funeral going on.

00:16:08.372 --> 00:16:13.772
And after the funeral they go home. How do you celebrate?

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:18.452
With a champagne! And after the funeral also real funeral

00:16:18.652 --> 00:16:20.372
also they’ll celebrate the… I don’t know why,

00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:24.572
but they take champagne.

00:16:27.772 --> 00:16:33.132
How can you celebrate Christ by insulting Him.

00:16:33.372 --> 00:16:35.932
He came to enlighten

00:16:36.132 --> 00:16:40.252
your awareness because He respected your awareness,

00:16:40.452 --> 00:16:45.452
the point at which it had reached, but you are trying to put it down.

00:16:45.652 --> 00:16:49.652
Is this the way to understand Him?

00:16:50.972 --> 00:16:56.492
And He has promised that you are to be baptized,

00:16:56.692 --> 00:17:00.332
you are to be born again. And now, in Sahaj Yoga,

00:17:00.532 --> 00:17:04.452
this promise is being fulfilled. So be joyous,

00:17:04.652 --> 00:17:09.132
that here at the Agnya chakra, again Christ is born within you

00:17:09.332 --> 00:17:15.572
and He’s there and you know how you can ask for his help, always.

00:17:16.612 --> 00:17:21.852
But the main thing that one has to understand,

00:17:22.132 --> 00:17:29.252
that the time has come for you to get all that is promised

00:17:29.572 --> 00:17:34.132
in the scriptures. Not only in the Bible, but all the scriptures

00:17:34.332 --> 00:17:38.132
of the world the time has come today.

00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:47.052
That you have to become a Christian, a Brahmin, a Peer,

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.972
through your Kundalini awakening only.

00:17:51.172 --> 00:17:59.212
There is no other way out. And that your last judgment is also now.

00:18:00.132 --> 00:18:07.532
Only through your Kundalini awakening, God is going to judge you.

00:18:08.332 --> 00:18:11.612
How is He going to judge you otherwise, you think of somebody now.

00:18:11.812 --> 00:18:14.972
A person comes in, now here is somebody sitting to judge you.

00:18:15.172 --> 00:18:19.172
How? By how many hair dressers you have been to?

00:18:19.652 --> 00:18:22.532
Or how many suits you have stitched for the Christmas?

00:18:22.732 --> 00:18:26.692
Or what presents you have bought and how many cards you have sent?

00:18:26.892 --> 00:18:31.612
And to how many people you have

00:18:31.932 --> 00:18:36.372
sent some other things which may not be very palatable.

00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:39.612
That’s not the way.

00:18:40.092 --> 00:18:45.252
Or is it, that at what price you bought all the things?

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:52.612
The way we are particular? Which way are we going to be judged

00:18:55.932 --> 00:18:58.652
by God?

00:18:58.852 --> 00:19:04.612
Not superficially people say, so what depth have we got, let’s see?

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:08.852
How far can we go in our depth?

00:19:09.132 --> 00:19:15.172
At the most we reach a point where we are nothing but a concept again.

00:19:15.452 --> 00:19:18.732
So whatever depth we know goes up to only rationality

00:19:18.932 --> 00:19:21.732
up to the concept point beyond that we can not reach.

00:19:21.932 --> 00:19:25.932
So how can we be judged?

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:32.452
How do people are judged if you go to a doctor?

00:19:32.692 --> 00:19:36.692
He has his instruments, an’ he works it out, puts the light in,

00:19:36.972 --> 00:19:41.892
sees for himself and says this is the position.

00:19:42.452 --> 00:19:49.052
And how your spirituality is going to be judged?

00:19:49.412 --> 00:19:55.292
How a seed is judged? By sprouting it!

00:19:55.612 --> 00:20:01.572
When you sprout the seed and when you see its germinating power

00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:04.012
you know it’s a good seed or a bad seed.

00:20:04.212 --> 00:20:09.612
In the same way, you will be judged by the way you are germinated,

00:20:09.932 --> 00:20:13.412
the way you receive your realization, the way you retain it,

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.052
the way you respect it.

00:20:15.252 --> 00:20:18.452
That is how you are going to be judged and not by the kind of dresses

00:20:18.652 --> 00:20:20.612
you are wearing.

00:20:20.812 --> 00:20:25.572
By the type of matching you do and the hair dressing you go to.

00:20:25.772 --> 00:20:30.132
Not by the big positions you occupy and the big politicians

00:20:30.332 --> 00:20:32.452
and big bureaucrats you become.

00:20:32.652 --> 00:20:39.292
Not by what kind of houses you have built and what kind of so called

00:20:39.492 --> 00:20:42.532
Noble [sic] prizes you have won.

00:20:42.732 --> 00:20:46.372
You are not also going to be judged by your philanthropic work

00:20:46.572 --> 00:20:49.932
by that you think that you have given so much money so much so,

00:20:50.132 --> 00:20:51.972
because you, if you have given so much money

00:20:52.172 --> 00:20:56.052
there will be big ego somewhere hanging and it will bring you down

00:20:56.252 --> 00:20:58.652
your scale.

00:20:59.772 --> 00:21:03.572
This is a judgment in which

00:21:03.852 --> 00:21:09.612
the little feather is going to weigh more, much more than a ship.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:17.532
It’s a different type of a judgment, of a personality.

00:21:17.892 --> 00:21:23.412
You can see how Christ was judged by human beings

00:21:23.652 --> 00:21:28.732
and how He was judged by God.

00:21:29.052 --> 00:21:40.212
He came and lived in the dried straw like a feather.

00:21:40.572 --> 00:21:45.972
His mother never felt His discomfort.

00:21:49.772 --> 00:22:01.612
In the same way those who have not by there being,

00:22:02.412 --> 00:22:10.932
oppressed others or taken oppression, are going to be judged

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:15.372
as first class.

00:22:16.132 --> 00:22:20.572
In the Kundalini awakening itself there are inherent defects.

00:22:20.812 --> 00:22:24.652
Inherently the Kundalini has some defects,

00:22:24.852 --> 00:22:28.852
because of your previous karmas.

00:22:30.172 --> 00:22:33.732
Because what you have been doing in this lifetime.

00:22:33.932 --> 00:22:40.172
Because, the things that you have accepted as

00:22:41.372 --> 00:22:44.692
reality, which is just a concept.

00:22:44.892 --> 00:22:48.452
Because, when you have not known the absolute,

00:22:48.692 --> 00:22:50.332
whatever you will be doing,

00:22:50.532 --> 00:22:54.532
there will be a little of ignorance with it.

00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:56.932
Whatever you have done in darkness

00:22:57.132 --> 00:23:01.132
will have a particle of darkness in it.

00:23:01.532 --> 00:23:05.492
So without knowing realization if you have propagated,

00:23:05.692 --> 00:23:10.772
“Oh, we are great saints, this that,” you’ll have no chance.

00:23:10.972 --> 00:23:14.292
If you think you are a very divine personality,

00:23:14.492 --> 00:23:19.692
and you are already a realized soul, no chances!

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:23.012
All the priests of all the religions,

00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:28.172
will be the last to get realization.

00:23:29.732 --> 00:23:34.732
Valmiki in his Ramayana, has very clearly said,

00:23:34.932 --> 00:23:39.532
a very interesting story is there, that, a dog was asked

00:23:39.732 --> 00:23:42.412
what do you want to be in your next life?

00:23:42.612 --> 00:23:47.172
So he told “make me anything but don’t make me a Mathadhish.”

00:23:47.412 --> 00:23:51.412
A person. Mathadhish is a person like a “priesthood.”

00:23:51.812 --> 00:23:57.692
So make me everything but not a priest anywhere.

00:23:58.132 --> 00:24:03.172
Just imagine a dog having that wisdom.

00:24:05.132 --> 00:24:09.652
But I do not say that all of them are like that.

00:24:09.932 --> 00:24:12.172
There may be some who are really genuine,

00:24:12.372 --> 00:24:16.692
some may be really realized people, may be authorized by God.

00:24:16.892 --> 00:24:19.812
But I am sure they are not accepted, by the multitude,

00:24:20.012 --> 00:24:24.132
I am sure of that. Because I have seen your history and all that,

00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:29.972
I’ve seen all such people have been discarded and have been tortured.

00:24:30.692 --> 00:24:40.452
But now the time has come… to judge the right and the wrong.

00:24:41.652 --> 00:24:47.052
You cannot crucify anymore. you cannot.

00:24:47.412 --> 00:24:52.892
Everyone is going to be judged through Kundalini awakening.

00:24:53.132 --> 00:25:00.772
Now, we should know there are three categories of human beings.

00:25:02.092 --> 00:25:04.652
I don’t know which way to start, not to shock you,

00:25:04.852 --> 00:25:12.052
one is human beings as we are, normal. They are called as Narayoni.

00:25:12.412 --> 00:25:14.972
The second categories are Devayoni.

00:25:15.172 --> 00:25:18.052
Those who are born seekers or realized souls,

00:25:18.252 --> 00:25:21.332
mostly realized souls are Devayoni.

00:25:21.532 --> 00:25:26.292
And the third ones are called as Rakshas. These are called as Ganas.

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:28.452
Actually these are called as Ganas.

00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:34.172
But is the We can say the species among human beings are Rakshasas.

00:25:34.372 --> 00:25:37.292
Means the people who are evil.

00:25:37.692 --> 00:25:43.412
So we have evil people, excellent people,

00:25:43.612 --> 00:25:51.292
and we have in-between people. Excellent people are very few.

00:25:51.492 --> 00:25:56.372
They are born realized. I don’t have their problem much.

00:25:56.652 --> 00:26:01.612
But one has to deal with the people who are in the center.

00:26:01.812 --> 00:26:10.532
They are looking towards good but have something hanging on to them,

00:26:10.732 --> 00:26:13.052
which is not so good.

00:26:13.332 --> 00:26:17.532
So for these people, there are inherently some defects

00:26:17.732 --> 00:26:21.052
in the Kundalini, which we must understand.

00:26:21.252 --> 00:26:27.292
The first of them is bad health,

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:34.052
physical bad health, actual physical bad health.

00:26:35.772 --> 00:26:42.492
In this country specially people suffer from too much of cold

00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:47.092
and other troubles due to over calcium in the water,

00:26:47.292 --> 00:26:51.212
in the same way according to the countries,

00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:54.732
stanavishesh as they call it, you have your problems.

00:26:54.932 --> 00:26:57.652
Like in our country we have some problems;

00:26:57.852 --> 00:26:59.812
like in your country you have certain problems.

00:27:00.012 --> 00:27:04.252
So, the physical problems are according to the country

00:27:04.452 --> 00:27:05.692
where you have taken your birth.

00:27:05.892 --> 00:27:12.092
Most of you have decided to take birth in particular countries.

00:27:13.972 --> 00:27:18.412
That’s why you are identified also to such an extent sometimes

00:27:18.612 --> 00:27:22.492
that you think there is no defect.

00:27:22.692 --> 00:27:28.332
Every country has a variety by which you suffer a certain

00:27:28.532 --> 00:27:32.172
amount of setback in your health.

00:27:32.732 --> 00:27:34.972
So for a Sahaj Yogi

00:27:35.172 --> 00:27:39.372
one should know that health is a very important thing.

00:27:39.572 --> 00:27:42.332
Because this body is the temple of God,

00:27:42.532 --> 00:27:45.132
and one has to look after your health.

00:27:45.332 --> 00:27:48.292
And you know also when the Kundalini rises the first thing that

00:27:48.492 --> 00:27:50.972
happens that your health improves.

00:27:51.172 --> 00:27:54.012
Because of the parasympathetic fulfillment.

00:27:54.212 --> 00:28:00.572
Because parasympathetic gives you enlightenment

00:28:00.772 --> 00:28:06.732
which flows into sympathetic and your health improves.

00:28:08.092 --> 00:28:12.372
I will not tell about it very elaborately today because time is short.

00:28:12.572 --> 00:28:17.852
But, if you read My..I would say I haven’t yet written much,

00:28:18.052 --> 00:28:20.492
but if you listen to My lectures,

00:28:20.692 --> 00:28:23.292
and some of them which are written down,

00:28:23.492 --> 00:28:30.172
you will know how Kundalini helps to cure most of the diseases,

00:28:30.412 --> 00:28:37.852
except for which are being tampered by human elements,

00:28:38.052 --> 00:28:41.892
like a kidney trouble now has been cured by Sahaj Yoga.

00:28:42.092 --> 00:28:45.212
No doubt, we can cure kidney trouble.

00:28:45.452 --> 00:28:48.812
But a person who has been on the machine, we’ve tried,

00:28:49.012 --> 00:28:50.692
cannot be cured.

00:28:50.892 --> 00:28:54.892
We can give him longevity, but he cannot be cured.

00:28:55.212 --> 00:28:59.332
But to cure people is not your job at all by any chance,

00:28:59.532 --> 00:29:00.572
you must remember this.

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:03.812
No Sahaj Yogi should take to curing people.

00:29:04.012 --> 00:29:06.532
They can use my photograph.

00:29:06.732 --> 00:29:11.052
But not to take to curing, because it means you are a big

00:29:11.252 --> 00:29:13.572
philanthropic personality.

00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:16.892
I have seen people who have been curing,

00:29:17.212 --> 00:29:20.452
get into such a mania of curing,

00:29:20.652 --> 00:29:23.692
that they forget that they are also catching something and

00:29:23.892 --> 00:29:26.532
they are also getting some troubles and they never cure them self,

00:29:26.732 --> 00:29:32.012
ultimately I find they get out of Sahaj Yoga.

00:29:33.092 --> 00:29:36.332
But with the Photograph you can cure people.

00:29:36.532 --> 00:29:41.892
Do not think that it is your duty that you are a great sort-of-a…

00:29:42.092 --> 00:29:48.972
what you call a… benefactor, physical benefactor, no, you are not.

00:29:49.292 --> 00:29:53.292
You are a spiritual benefactor but as a byproduct,

00:29:54.012 --> 00:29:59.932
the body of the person improves because if

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:03.532
Christ has to be awakened,

00:30:03.772 --> 00:30:11.572
if God has to come in this body, then this body is to be cleansed.

00:30:12.212 --> 00:30:16.212
It is done by Kundalini.

00:30:16.612 --> 00:30:23.932
But it does not have a separate work like hospitals.

00:30:24.372 --> 00:30:28.572
I have known people who went so mad with their power of curing that

00:30:28.772 --> 00:30:32.772
they started visiting regularly the hospitals,

00:30:32.972 --> 00:30:36.532
and they ended up in the hospital only.

00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:39.372
They would not even come to programs;

00:30:39.572 --> 00:30:42.012
they would not even come and see Me.

00:30:42.212 --> 00:30:44.852
So this is one of the greatest hurdles you have got

00:30:45.052 --> 00:30:52.452
is the Vyadhi, is the bodily elements.

00:30:54.292 --> 00:31:00.172
And the bodily element also should not take you down too much.

00:31:00.412 --> 00:31:03.332
If we have some problem, forget it.

00:31:03.532 --> 00:31:05.972
Gradually it will improve, with some people it takes time

00:31:06.172 --> 00:31:07.932
to get all right.

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:12.892
But the main thing is, to get to your spirit.

00:31:13.092 --> 00:31:18.572
So do not always say “Mother, cure me, cure me, cure me.”

00:31:18.852 --> 00:31:22.052
But just say “Mother give me the spiritual life,”

00:31:22.252 --> 00:31:25.812
and you will be cured automatically.

00:31:26.052 --> 00:31:30.052
It may take time in some people, doesn’t matter.

00:31:30.252 --> 00:31:32.892
You have been sick all your life, doesn’t matter.

00:31:33.092 --> 00:31:35.772
Little more time.

00:31:36.092 --> 00:31:39.292
And also follow the methods which [I HAVE …del] we have told,

00:31:39.492 --> 00:31:46.172
about different diseases, specially liver in this country, colds,

00:31:46.452 --> 00:31:50.372
and what you call this gout and all these troubles.

00:31:50.572 --> 00:31:55.612
We have remedies for all this. Diabetes, we have,

00:31:55.932 --> 00:32:05.772
but work it out as a duty towards your body, towards the temple.

00:32:06.492 --> 00:32:10.692
But that should not be the end of your life,

00:32:10.892 --> 00:32:13.252
that’s a very little part.

00:32:13.452 --> 00:32:17.212
I mean it would be something like cleaning the whole place…

00:32:17.412 --> 00:32:19.932
and then you get out of it. They say “Why did you clean?”

00:32:20.132 --> 00:32:23.452
Like I have seen here people, you see, even we were in Oxstead

00:32:23.652 --> 00:32:26.932
I was surprised, you see everybody used to polish everything you know,

00:32:27.132 --> 00:32:31.572
and everything was, sort of, lawn was done very well

00:32:31.772 --> 00:32:34.932
and everything cleaned very well, and not even a rat would enter

00:32:35.132 --> 00:32:36.172
their houses even.

00:32:36.372 --> 00:32:39.772
For months together I never saw any person getting in,

00:32:39.972 --> 00:32:43.452
only getting out, and they were so particular.

00:32:43.652 --> 00:32:47.652
Husband wife, so particular about cleanliness, neatness, everything…

00:32:48.092 --> 00:32:50.492
and the both of them would never even talk to each other,

00:32:50.692 --> 00:32:54.812
I have seen that. There were seven houses, except for our house,

00:32:55.012 --> 00:32:57.452
and [SHE WAS …del] they were all surprised at how many people are

00:32:57.652 --> 00:32:59.852
coming to our house, they said “Are you a open house?

00:33:00.052 --> 00:33:01.652
I said “Yes, it is a open house.”

00:33:01.852 --> 00:33:05.852
They couldn’t understand what was wrong with us.

00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:08.732
Nobody would see that polished thing or anything,

00:33:08.932 --> 00:33:12.932
so, that’s how it should be that we should not go to that extent.

00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:17.572
That it becomes a sort of real “Sahaj Yoga and the rest”

00:33:17.772 --> 00:33:20.212
which is the most important is forgotten.

00:33:20.612 --> 00:33:24.612
Health will improve gradually as I have told you.

00:33:25.492 --> 00:33:29.492
But attention should be on your spirit.

00:33:29.892 --> 00:33:34.772
Attention should be on your spirit, because it is the attention,

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:39.012
which goes into these various directions and gets stuck.

00:33:39.572 --> 00:33:42.852
You just allow it to work out and it will work out.

00:33:43.132 --> 00:33:52.612
The second hurdle which I feel, is called as akarmanyeta.

00:33:53.132 --> 00:34:01.332
Osnath, they call it. Means a person… does not want to work it out.

00:34:01.652 --> 00:34:03.692
Of course those people who are useless,

00:34:03.892 --> 00:34:06.932
who do not want to have realization, forget about them.

00:34:07.132 --> 00:34:11.052
But even after getting realization, it’s an innate problem

00:34:11.252 --> 00:34:16.532
with people that they do not want to work it out.

00:34:17.132 --> 00:34:22.212
They are lazy; in simple words, they are lazy.

00:34:22.412 --> 00:34:24.852
That is very much in this country, surprisingly.

00:34:25.052 --> 00:34:28.892
I mean the other day I saw a picture, where how, even from your

00:34:29.092 --> 00:34:35.212
country people went to Germany and blasted a complete machinery

00:34:35.412 --> 00:34:38.372
and a complete factory of that machinery which was sending

00:34:38.572 --> 00:34:41.372
pilot-less bombs.

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:44.732
And they have overdone everything so then our children are having a

00:34:44.932 --> 00:34:54.452
nice time, perhaps. But, in Sahaj Yoga, you have to be alert .

00:34:55.252 --> 00:35:00.052
This what exactly happens in Sahaj Yoga when people come here:

00:35:00.332 --> 00:35:03.052
they get their realization, they feel the cool breeze,

00:35:03.252 --> 00:35:08.132
and is lost again. The reason is, they do not want to work it out.

00:35:08.332 --> 00:35:11.652
This is another danger, akarmanyeta.

00:35:11.852 --> 00:35:16.132
Then, when it is lost, after one year they’ll come back “Mother?

00:35:16.332 --> 00:35:19.932
We don’t believe in it, but I have got some pain in the stomach,

00:35:20.132 --> 00:35:22.532
will You cure me?”

00:35:23.012 --> 00:35:28.372
Instead of… you becoming so equipped with all the powers that you

00:35:28.572 --> 00:35:31.772
have, you become another useless person coming here,

00:35:31.972 --> 00:35:38.212
just to take My time. These powers are all within you.

00:35:38.412 --> 00:35:42.732
This is your property. This is the property of your spirit

00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:47.852
which is there inside, which is about to manifest but,

00:35:48.052 --> 00:35:54.292
because of certain hurdles that you accept, that it does not.

00:35:55.652 --> 00:35:59.092
This is akarmanyta, we can say.

00:35:59.412 --> 00:36:02.732
Which is, not working it out, not knowing about it,

00:36:02.932 --> 00:36:05.732
not understanding it, what is Sahaj Yoga is,

00:36:05.932 --> 00:36:09.092
how to manipulate this, what are these vibrations are,

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:16.212
how it works out? People just say, “Oh! It’s too much.”

00:36:16.492 --> 00:36:19.772
Because they don’t want to face the reality.

00:36:20.012 --> 00:36:22.412
Because as soon as your Kundalini comes up,

00:36:22.612 --> 00:36:26.212
as soon as the light comes in before, the eyes are closed,

00:36:26.412 --> 00:36:29.812
you see suddenly the light comes in, you don’t want to open your eyes.

00:36:30.012 --> 00:36:33.132
Because too much we have been sleeping.

00:36:33.412 --> 00:36:35.572
Even if you open your eyes a little bit, “Oh God!”

00:36:35.772 --> 00:36:37.612
You don’t want to face the light.

00:36:37.812 --> 00:36:40.652
Because you are identified with that state,

00:36:40.852 --> 00:36:44.852
you do not want to open your eyes.

00:36:46.052 --> 00:36:50.172
Kundalini opens your eyes, no doubt, but again you close it down.

00:36:50.492 --> 00:36:56.292
So it is in your freedom, to give up that akarmanyeta.

00:36:56.652 --> 00:37:02.052
Now this is also, can be very collective, I can tell you this much.

00:37:02.252 --> 00:37:05.332
It’s a very big disease, which spreads.

00:37:05.532 --> 00:37:09.932
Like, say a husband wife is there, the wife is one like that.

00:37:10.132 --> 00:37:14.452
Instead of the husband raising the wife, he will succumb to wife,

00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:18.132
specially in the west. Just the opposite in India,

00:37:18.332 --> 00:37:22.852
because [THE del] there the husband is more dominating,

00:37:23.092 --> 00:37:26.292
the women will succumb to a husband.

00:37:26.532 --> 00:37:31.572
So what happens is, that out of the two those who have got it also

00:37:31.812 --> 00:37:33.492
are just wasted.

00:37:33.692 --> 00:37:37.052
Instead of that, both of them could be very well realized,

00:37:37.252 --> 00:37:40.892
and could be there if the one who is realized,

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:45.532
puts down his will, that “No, I’ll keep my eyes open to see.

00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:52.292
Let me see. I must give a chance to myself.” If they accept it,

00:37:52.572 --> 00:37:57.812
then it works and then they go to the second step.

00:37:58.172 --> 00:38:03.452
Everything cannot be just like a jet liner, sit down here and…

00:38:03.652 --> 00:38:09.932
next moment you are on the… moon?

00:38:10.612 --> 00:38:13.452
Even if you are in the moon,

00:38:13.732 --> 00:38:17.172
still you may start with the third danger which is there,

00:38:17.372 --> 00:38:23.772
is sanshaya. Is the doubting.

00:38:24.852 --> 00:38:30.212
I don’t know how to describe this madness of doubting.

00:38:30.492 --> 00:38:34.812
For example, out of all of you who have been here,

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:41.172
I would say, at least, I don’t know how much percentage…

00:38:41.372 --> 00:38:42.492
[Yogi very softly:] Ninety.

00:38:42.732 --> 00:38:45.892
[Shri Mataji:] [laughs] …have come out with the second day

00:38:46.092 --> 00:38:51.412
a very great statement “Still I am doubting.”

00:38:51.612 --> 00:38:57.652
Is that the sign of wisdom? What are you doubting?

00:38:59.292 --> 00:39:03.292
What have you found out so far?

00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:07.092
From where does this come?

00:39:07.332 --> 00:39:12.812
Is Mr. Ego, about which I have given lectures after lectures.

00:39:13.132 --> 00:39:16.932
Is Mr. Ego that is doubting it?

00:39:17.132 --> 00:39:19.492
Because he doesn’t want you to find the absolute.

00:39:19.692 --> 00:39:23.092
You are identified with your Ego,

00:39:23.292 --> 00:39:25.852
and you do not want to find it because,

00:39:26.052 --> 00:39:29.412
this Mr. Ego has been guiding your life throughout,

00:39:29.652 --> 00:39:33.652
and now [YOU DON’T …del] you want to doubt. Doubt what?

00:39:34.652 --> 00:39:41.132
What are you doubting? You felt the cool breeze, all right?

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:42.572
Sit down then.

00:39:42.772 --> 00:39:45.852
It would be something like somebody entering into a college,

00:39:46.052 --> 00:39:50.852
university, and they are going sitting down firstly there,

00:39:51.092 --> 00:39:54.812
teacher says “Now, this is the diagram, I give you.”

00:39:55.012 --> 00:40:00.172
The students get up and say, “Sir we doubt.” Really?

00:40:00.492 --> 00:40:04.492
Then what should the teacher say. But they will not say that,

00:40:04.692 --> 00:40:11.932
because they have paid the fees. They have paid it.

00:40:12.372 --> 00:40:16.732
Even if it is a horrible drama, boring one,

00:40:16.932 --> 00:40:19.612
still we go through it because we have paid, you see?

00:40:19.812 --> 00:40:25.172
To go through it “After all, we have paid it,” you see? What to do?

00:40:26.012 --> 00:40:30.012
But for Sahaj Yoga you cannot pay.

00:40:31.332 --> 00:40:36.452
I have seen all kinds of tomfoolery people accept in so many gurus.

00:40:36.812 --> 00:40:40.412
Like somebody says “I am going to teach you how to fly.”

00:40:40.652 --> 00:40:43.612
They’re absolutely ready for that.

00:40:43.812 --> 00:40:46.692
They’ll pay money, and not doubt, even a bit,

00:40:46.892 --> 00:40:49.812
that the fellow who is propagating is he flying?

00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:51.532
Have you seen him flying anywhere?

00:40:51.732 --> 00:40:54.332
Please at least ask that person to fly.

00:40:54.532 --> 00:40:57.612
They will see the Kundalini rising with their eyes,

00:40:57.812 --> 00:41:00.652
they will see it pulsating, rising, breaking here,

00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:03.212
still they’ll sit down and say “I am doubting.”

00:41:03.412 --> 00:41:07.732
Now who are you? How far have you reached?

00:41:08.012 --> 00:41:12.012
Why are you doubting? What are you doubting?

00:41:12.852 --> 00:41:15.292
What have you known so far about yourself?

00:41:15.492 --> 00:41:20.772
Now, humble down yourself at this point Humble down in your heart.

00:41:21.012 --> 00:41:27.412
“No I have not known myself. I have to know myself.

00:41:28.132 --> 00:41:31.772
I have not known myself, I haven’t got the absolute.

00:41:31.972 --> 00:41:33.892
With what instruments I am doubting?”

00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:37.692
This is one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini awakening

00:41:37.892 --> 00:41:42.652
and in after awakening, called as Samshaya.

00:41:42.932 --> 00:41:46.812
[THE SECOND …del] The fourth one we can call it as Pramaada,

00:41:47.012 --> 00:41:53.572
is the one by which we go on faltering all the time…

00:41:55.172 --> 00:42:00.212
foolish questions. I mean there are certain things one has to follow,

00:42:00.412 --> 00:42:02.692
if you are going on the road you see,

00:42:02.892 --> 00:42:06.292
you are used to say continental driving,

00:42:06.492 --> 00:42:10.612
so always you turn on the wrong side,

00:42:10.812 --> 00:42:14.372
but in London you will be arrested.

00:42:14.572 --> 00:42:18.572
In the same way so far you have been doing continental driving.

00:42:18.932 --> 00:42:26.292
Now you are in London, so you better take to the ways of Londoners

00:42:26.492 --> 00:42:31.132
and understand the roads and the maps and the regulations

00:42:31.332 --> 00:42:37.572
that are needed, and try to follow them. But you are doubting it.

00:42:37.852 --> 00:42:42.132
That’s the main point. Then you don’t want to follow it.

00:42:42.332 --> 00:42:45.892
So the pramad is the mistakes that arise,

00:42:46.092 --> 00:42:53.812
because Kundalini awakening is a free gift to anyone who comes here.

00:42:55.252 --> 00:43:02.972
To anyone who has been to any sort of hell or heaven or has done…

00:43:03.172 --> 00:43:04.612
[Break in original recording, end of tape side 1]

00:43:04.812 --> 00:43:11.612
point about it. And why do you doubt. You are not paying any money.

00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:14.212
These two things go hand in hand –

00:43:14.412 --> 00:43:18.732
doubting and pramad is the mistakes that we commit throughout.

00:43:18.932 --> 00:43:21.892
Because we are doubting, that’s why we do not take it up seriously,

00:43:22.092 --> 00:43:24.172
we do not understand it – the rule of the road –

00:43:24.372 --> 00:43:32.772
and we just start driving. And then we have accidents.

00:43:33.332 --> 00:43:38.372
And then when we have accidents we blame Mataji for that.

00:43:40.892 --> 00:43:47.012
That is a very-very, common thing that happens,

00:43:47.292 --> 00:43:50.692
that we blame Sahaj Yoga.

00:43:51.052 --> 00:43:53.732
We blame that spontaneous happening within us;

00:43:53.932 --> 00:43:56.172
we never take the blame upon ourselves,

00:43:56.372 --> 00:43:59.212
that “No, I must have done this mistake.” All right, doesn’t matter,

00:43:59.412 --> 00:44:03.412
if I make mistakes I will rectify, it’s all right.

00:44:04.572 --> 00:44:09.332
Mother is forgiving, no doubt, I forgive,

00:44:09.612 --> 00:44:12.092
but sometimes my forgiveness is also of no use

00:44:12.292 --> 00:44:15.212
because unless and until you realize that it was a mistake

00:44:15.412 --> 00:44:18.092
you should go this way instead of that you have gone that way,

00:44:18.292 --> 00:44:22.292
so rule of the road is to be understood.

00:44:22.652 --> 00:44:27.572
That is the one comes to us, called as pramad.

00:44:27.772 --> 00:44:34.212
After that, we have another inherent problem is called as

00:44:34.412 --> 00:44:38.892
Bhramadarshan, hallucinations.

00:44:39.292 --> 00:44:42.412
We start seeing hallucinations, specially with people who take

00:44:42.612 --> 00:44:44.692
LSD and all [THE …del] such things.

00:44:44.892 --> 00:44:48.892
They don’t see Me sometimes they just see lights.

00:44:49.652 --> 00:44:54.892
Or any such hallucinations you see of the future or of the past.

00:44:55.172 --> 00:44:56.932
They may see Me as something else

00:44:57.132 --> 00:44:58.892
and they may see Me as something else.

00:44:59.092 --> 00:45:01.292
If you see Me in dreams is all right,

00:45:01.492 --> 00:45:03.652
or see something in dreams is all right.

00:45:03.852 --> 00:45:10.852
But you start seeing some things, that’s called as Bhramadarsha.

00:45:11.052 --> 00:45:16.012
Bhrama means illusion. Then you start developing illusions.

00:45:16.252 --> 00:45:21.412
But the worst part of it is that people start telling lies about it.

00:45:21.932 --> 00:45:28.652
I know about everyone. And when this bhramadarshan starts,

00:45:28.852 --> 00:45:33.732
it’s the most dangerous thing about vibrations also.

00:45:33.972 --> 00:45:40.492
Some people are absolutely cocksure about themselves, I see that.

00:45:40.972 --> 00:45:44.412
And they’ll tell all the world, you see they’ll dominate everybody

00:45:44.612 --> 00:45:46.212
saying that “The vibrations of this is not good,

00:45:46.412 --> 00:45:47.932
the vibrations of that is not good,”

00:45:48.132 --> 00:45:51.972
while they have no mastery over it.

00:45:52.172 --> 00:45:54.612
Now if I, somehow or the other,

00:45:54.852 --> 00:45:58.012
see I have to be very careful I can’t talk like a teacher,

00:45:58.212 --> 00:46:01.252
so I somehow or other say that “All right, you give yourself a bandhan

00:46:01.452 --> 00:46:03.412
and now you put your hands towards me and you see for yourself,”

00:46:03.612 --> 00:46:04.852
and all that.

00:46:05.052 --> 00:46:12.092
If they by any chance know that I’ve found out, that they are lying,

00:46:12.332 --> 00:46:14.492
then they are finished.

00:46:14.732 --> 00:46:19.372
I must keep up their falsehood everything in me.

00:46:19.652 --> 00:46:22.972
In by chance you see, I am very careful though because I know

00:46:23.172 --> 00:46:25.332
they are always on a slippery ground,

00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:33.292
so even if I mention in a way that is not so blunt or anything,

00:46:33.492 --> 00:46:40.492
still it might happen. But one must know that it is for our good,

00:46:40.852 --> 00:46:46.212
that we have to stick on to the truth. And we should not be led away

00:46:46.452 --> 00:46:51.572
by our own ideas about ourselves.

00:46:55.332 --> 00:47:02.692
Then [THE – del] another thing comes is – Vishaychitta.

00:47:03.012 --> 00:47:06.652
In which the attention is attracted by objects

00:47:06.852 --> 00:47:10.732
of your previous identification.

00:47:10.932 --> 00:47:14.412
Like your attention has been, “You see I’m very found of cricket,”

00:47:14.612 --> 00:47:20.252
“all right, you are.” But you should not be a sick person.

00:47:20.532 --> 00:47:25.932
I mean cricket doesn’t mean that you become a cricket bat.

00:47:26.212 --> 00:47:28.292
And you are good for nothing for anything else,

00:47:28.492 --> 00:47:31.292
for all practical purposes you are dead.

00:47:31.492 --> 00:47:37.932
That kind of craziness, for anything whatsoever,

00:47:38.452 --> 00:47:41.972
gets your attention into a very wrong state,

00:47:42.172 --> 00:47:44.972
and is also not good for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:47:45.172 --> 00:47:48.012
Today’s lecture is more for the Sahaj Yogi.

00:47:48.212 --> 00:47:53.892
So I am pointing out what are the inherent dangers of

00:47:54.172 --> 00:48:01.452
sustaining our realization. Which is very important to understand.

00:48:02.892 --> 00:48:08.172
Now the two other very big dangers which we suffer from,

00:48:08.372 --> 00:48:10.892
apart from that the people get possessed

00:48:11.132 --> 00:48:13.612
and get ideas into their heads,

00:48:13.812 --> 00:48:18.212
they start singing songs, this that Sometimes I am so embarrassed,

00:48:18.412 --> 00:48:22.292
I don’t know what to say, I can see a devil speaking through them,

00:48:22.492 --> 00:48:25.292
but I just don’t know how to tell them that “Oh please stop.”

00:48:25.492 --> 00:48:28.892
Even praising Me I know what it is.

00:48:29.092 --> 00:48:32.972
But they’ll just come up and say, “Mother, we want to sing a song to

00:48:33.172 --> 00:48:36.212
you.” “All right, finished.” I can not say anything,

00:48:36.412 --> 00:48:39.292
because they do not know what they are singing.

00:48:39.492 --> 00:48:42.132
They do not know from where did they get this knowledge.

00:48:42.332 --> 00:48:46.332
It’s something else doing this.

00:48:48.332 --> 00:48:52.332
Because of all these problems that you get possessed,

00:48:53.092 --> 00:48:55.252
the other day somebody came to me and said,

00:48:55.452 --> 00:48:59.692
that “Mother I’m feeling very overconfident about myself and cocksure.”

00:48:59.892 --> 00:49:03.092
“Really?”“And I feel like doing something very high handed,”

00:49:03.292 --> 00:49:10.892
and he did it. First he saw the possession coming in to him.

00:49:11.492 --> 00:49:15.772
And then he did it, and did it in a very bad way.

00:49:15.972 --> 00:49:21.652
Everybody’s angry with him. I know, but I’m not.

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:24.492
Because something is done in possession,

00:49:24.692 --> 00:49:29.092
you don’t know what madness people can do when they get possessed.

00:49:29.332 --> 00:49:32.372
I mean they should end up in lunatic asylum, but because of being

00:49:32.572 --> 00:49:36.132
Sahaj Yogis, they do all these things.

00:49:36.332 --> 00:49:41.612
But still they are not stationed where they should be.

00:49:44.292 --> 00:49:47.812
Then there are two more stages in which,

00:49:48.172 --> 00:49:52.452
a Kundalini which rises also falls down.

00:49:52.652 --> 00:49:57.132
This is an inherent danger in a person. Many people have asked Me

00:49:57.332 --> 00:50:01.172
that “Mother, if we get realization does it stay?”

00:50:01.372 --> 00:50:06.652
It does stay, part of it. Sometimes it is very thin part of it,

00:50:06.852 --> 00:50:12.412
sometimes the whole thing is sucked back. It is sucked back.

00:50:12.732 --> 00:50:15.372
Is so, then you will say “Then we start doubting.”

00:50:15.572 --> 00:50:20.332
Where is it written that, “You will be lifted up

00:50:20.532 --> 00:50:27.452
and put into something great, whatever may be your problems.”

00:50:27.692 --> 00:50:31.452
Is it possible? Even from here if I have to go to India,

00:50:31.652 --> 00:50:35.132
I have to get inoculations and vaccinations,

00:50:35.332 --> 00:50:40.972
and I have to get My passport, go through an interview…

00:50:41.172 --> 00:50:45.172
While if you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

00:50:45.372 --> 00:50:49.932
then you are going to be judged, not only judged,

00:50:50.132 --> 00:50:54.052
but even when supposing you give a grace mark and all that

00:50:54.252 --> 00:50:57.172
and a person is allowed to sort of, get into the plane,

00:50:57.372 --> 00:51:01.812
may be that they may ask you to get down. Is possible.

00:51:02.132 --> 00:51:07.252
And that happens with some people that the Kundalini falls down.

00:51:07.572 --> 00:51:13.292
Is very, very dangerous sign. It comes through many problems

00:51:13.492 --> 00:51:19.132
like gurus and, going to wrong places also going to spirits

00:51:19.332 --> 00:51:26.892
and doing all black magic and, also bowing before people who are not

00:51:27.172 --> 00:51:33.332
incarnations, worshipping wrong type of deities and also doing

00:51:33.532 --> 00:51:39.692
mad rituals. Fasting at wrong times and not understanding

00:51:39.892 --> 00:51:44.572
the signs of fasting and of ritualism and chakras and the

00:51:44.772 --> 00:51:49.692
connection a complete synthesis of Sahaj Yoga.

00:51:50.252 --> 00:51:54.652
And it falls down. In some people you have seen that Kundalini rises

00:51:54.852 --> 00:51:58.812
and immediately falls down is a very, very dangerous thing which

00:51:59.012 --> 00:52:01.572
really is very troublesome also.

00:52:01.772 --> 00:52:05.772
But still one can fix it up.

00:52:06.292 --> 00:52:11.252
Last danger that we have which one should know that you start feeling

00:52:11.452 --> 00:52:17.732
that you have become God or some like an incarnation or something.

00:52:18.132 --> 00:52:22.012
This is the biggest danger. And then you start taking law into your

00:52:22.212 --> 00:52:30.172
own hands and start rebuking others or… doing all kind of highhanded

00:52:30.372 --> 00:52:37.932
business. Or getting over self-satisfied with yourself.

00:52:38.212 --> 00:52:40.572
This is a very big danger.

00:52:40.852 --> 00:52:48.212
Humility is the only way, to know that there’s an ocean before you.

00:52:48.492 --> 00:52:53.852
You have got into the boat all right, but you have to know a lot,

00:52:54.132 --> 00:52:59.292
you have to understand a lot, and you have to still attend to your

00:52:59.492 --> 00:53:04.252
attention, to your chitta, to your awareness.

00:53:04.532 --> 00:53:09.012
And you have to still work it out in such a way

00:53:09.212 --> 00:53:16.372
that you really establish your self, as a full-fledged Sahaj Yogi

00:53:16.572 --> 00:53:20.572
by which collectivity becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:53:20.772 --> 00:53:24.452
By which you have no doubts left.

00:53:24.652 --> 00:53:28.932
From thoughtless awareness you jump into doubtless awareness.

00:53:29.132 --> 00:53:33.052
Unless and until that happens within you, is not mind,

00:53:33.252 --> 00:53:36.252
but is a state in which only the Kundalini will rise,

00:53:36.452 --> 00:53:38.932
whenever you’ll raise your hands.

00:53:39.132 --> 00:53:42.212
Unless and until you have achieved that state,

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:49.292
please try to work it out, don’t be lazy.

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:52.972
You have to see around yourself, meet people, talk to them,

00:53:53.172 --> 00:53:56.492
the more you talk about it the more you do it the more you give it,

00:53:56.732 --> 00:53:58.772
the more it will flow.

00:53:59.052 --> 00:54:03.052
The more you sit at home, “Oh, I am doing my puja at home.” Nothing.

00:54:03.732 --> 00:54:07.572
It will stagnate and stagnate. You have to give it to others,

00:54:07.772 --> 00:54:11.772
you have to think of others. Thousands of them have to have it.

00:54:12.412 --> 00:54:16.772
And that’s why it is important that don’t get bloated with the idea

00:54:16.972 --> 00:54:20.412
that you have all the powers of the world, already manifesting.

00:54:20.612 --> 00:54:21.852
Never.

00:54:22.052 --> 00:54:26.852
When these powers really manifest you are really not aware of them.

00:54:27.092 --> 00:54:32.932
Absolutely. I mean imagine the Sun saying “I am The Sun.”

00:54:33.252 --> 00:54:36.132
Will he say so? When he is the Sun, what is there?

00:54:36.332 --> 00:54:38.092
If you go and ask the Sun “Are you The Sun?”

00:54:38.292 --> 00:54:42.292
He said “Yes, by the way I am, what can I do about it?”

00:54:43.652 --> 00:54:46.692
It’s that simple, you know you become a very simple person,

00:54:46.892 --> 00:54:51.092
absolutely simple, because there is no…

00:54:51.292 --> 00:54:56.172
camouflage, there’s no complication. You are that.

00:54:57.332 --> 00:55:01.772
So, anybody asks you funny questions you say, “By the way,

00:55:01.972 --> 00:55:04.692
what is there to ask?, It is so. I mean, if I am a realized soul,

00:55:04.892 --> 00:55:08.892
I am, what does it matter?”

00:55:11.572 --> 00:55:16.932
With this understanding we have to go to Sahaj Yoga,

00:55:17.132 --> 00:55:23.532
which I must say I am surprised, how it is working, miraculously.

00:55:24.652 --> 00:55:28.932
And it is working out, but it is you who can settle it,

00:55:29.132 --> 00:55:36.492
within yourself. Now, among you some are only on the periphery.

00:55:36.852 --> 00:55:40.492
We keep them on periphery also, that you know very well.

00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:43.572
Some of them come in the center.

00:55:43.852 --> 00:55:49.612
And some are very few, who are in the inner circle.

00:55:49.812 --> 00:55:54.852
All of them are still in a state where they can be thrown out,

00:55:55.092 --> 00:55:57.212
like a tangent go down, you see?

00:55:57.412 --> 00:56:00.772
And then you don’t understand why a Sahaj Yogi behaves like that.

00:56:00.972 --> 00:56:04.052
If you see some Sahaj Yogi behaving like that, going in a tangent

00:56:04.252 --> 00:56:08.252
know that you might do the same. So be careful.

00:56:09.092 --> 00:56:16.932
So, today, at this juncture, when we are celebrating the great event

00:56:17.132 --> 00:56:21.132
of Christ’ life, let us know that Christ is born within us,

00:56:21.372 --> 00:56:25.372
and the Bethlehem is within us.

00:56:26.572 --> 00:56:30.252
You don’t have to go to Bethlehem it’s within us.

00:56:30.452 --> 00:56:38.372
He is there, and we have to look after it. It’s still a child.

00:56:38.932 --> 00:56:44.292
You have to respect it, and you have to look after it.

00:56:44.612 --> 00:56:47.812
So the light… really glows

00:56:48.012 --> 00:56:52.932
and people know that you are realized souls.

00:56:53.132 --> 00:56:56.292
Nobody will doubt that you are not.

00:56:56.382 --> 00:57:02.942
May God bless you, all.
