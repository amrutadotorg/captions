00:01.200 --> 00:07.280
This day for us to remember that Christ was born on this earth.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.520
As a human being, He came on this earth.

00:12.320 --> 00:15.002
And the task that was before Him

00:15.062 --> 00:20.342
was to enlighten human awareness

00:21.932 --> 00:29.012
with the sense of understanding,

00:29.372 --> 00:32.172
but we can say it is actualization,

00:32.612 --> 00:36.612
within the awareness of human beings,

00:37.452 --> 00:43.572
that they are not this body but they are the spirit.

00:44.412 --> 00:48.852
The message of Christ is His resurrection.

00:49.652 --> 00:55.092
That is you are your spirit and not your body.

00:56.892 --> 01:00.892
And He showed by His resurrection,

01:02.052 --> 01:08.972
how He ascended into the realm of spirit – which He was,

01:09.212 --> 01:16.052
because He was Pranava, He was Brahma, He was Mahavishnu –

01:16.252 --> 01:21.612
as I have told you about His birth.

01:26.692 --> 01:35.692
And when He came on this earth, in a body, like a human being,

01:36.932 --> 01:39.932
He wanted to show another thing

01:40.132 --> 01:44.732
that spirit has nothing to do with money,

01:44.932 --> 01:48.932
has nothing to do with power.

01:51.972 --> 02:04.052
It is all powerful, all pervading, but He’s born in a stable,

02:09.092 --> 02:19.012
not in a palace or to a king

02:19.212 --> 02:25.892
but He was born to a very ordinary person, a carpenter.

02:33.212 --> 02:41.852
Because if you are the king, as we say in Hindi language, Badshah

02:42.412 --> 02:47.612
then nothing is greater than you, isn’t it? It means simply that.

02:47.972 --> 02:52.652
Nothing is higher than you, neither anything can decorate you,

02:52.852 --> 02:56.852
because whatever you are, you are at the highest.

02:57.492 --> 03:06.972
All the worldly things so called, are just like dry grass, Trinavat.

03:07.372 --> 03:12.932
So He was kept in the dried grass.

03:13.932 --> 03:20.572
To many it makes very unhappy and they feel very sorry,

03:20.812 --> 03:26.212
that Christ, the one who came to save us,

03:26.452 --> 03:30.132
was kept under such conditions and why not God provided Him with

03:30.332 --> 03:35.932
something better? But to such people it does not matter:

03:36.252 --> 03:41.452
whether you are lying in the dried grass or in the stable

03:41.652 --> 03:45.572
or in the palaces, everything is just the same

03:45.772 --> 03:49.492
for it does not touch them, they are so detached

03:49.692 --> 03:55.212
and they are completely in joy. They are the masters of themselves –

03:55.412 --> 03:59.412
nothing can master them.

04:00.292 --> 04:04.292
No matter can master them, no comfort can master them.

04:05.532 --> 04:09.732
They are masters of complete comforts within themselves,

04:09.932 --> 04:12.372
they have achieved all the comforts within themselves,

04:12.572 --> 04:15.252
they are satisfied people.

04:15.932 --> 04:19.012
That’s why they are kings, they are called as kings,

04:19.212 --> 04:24.132
not those kings who run after things,

04:24.732 --> 04:27.372
or those kings who seek comforts in life.

04:27.572 --> 04:30.612
I mean if you have comforts well and good.

04:30.892 --> 04:36.492
If you don’t have well and good, makes no difference.

04:39.012 --> 04:42.732
So many people, specially in Latin America when I went there,

04:42.932 --> 04:44.892
they said, “but we can’t understand why

04:45.092 --> 04:48.292
Christ was born as a poor man.”

04:48.492 --> 04:51.332
This is again the human concept about God is,

04:51.532 --> 04:57.012
you see he wants to command God, be born in a King’s palace.

04:57.212 --> 05:04.012
You cannot order Him about. We have our own concepts about God that,

05:04.212 --> 05:07.612
“why should He be a poor man; why should He be helpless?”

05:07.812 --> 05:10.212
He never showed His helplessness.

05:10.412 --> 05:13.892
He was much more dynamic than all your kings and all your

05:14.092 --> 05:18.092
politicians put together. He was not afraid of anyone.

05:18.932 --> 05:21.452
Whatever He had to say He said it.

05:21.692 --> 05:27.932
He was not afraid of crucifixion or any such “punishment” so called.

05:28.572 --> 05:31.012
It’s only the human beings. you see,

05:31.212 --> 05:34.252
who have these false ideas about life

05:34.492 --> 05:38.492
and that’s why they want to put these ideas onto God also

05:38.692 --> 05:43.492
and try to make Him follow their own concepts.

05:43.972 --> 05:50.652
God is not your concept. He’s not a concept at all.

05:52.812 --> 05:56.692
To also say that “Concept is after all is a concept”

05:56.892 --> 06:00.892
is also a concept – this I found out very recently.

06:01.212 --> 06:04.212
This is another myth people carry.

06:04.692 --> 06:08.692
Those who say, that “Oh, concept is a concept! All right?

06:08.892 --> 06:11.332
Mataji says, all right.” So what?

06:11.532 --> 06:19.572
But even this is a concept, because concept is thought.

06:19.852 --> 06:23.532
You have to rise beyond thought at a higher level

06:23.732 --> 06:30.172
into thoughtless awareness where you are not in thought but you are

06:30.372 --> 06:32.932
in the center of the thought.

06:33.172 --> 06:36.172
In the sense that one thought rises and falls

06:36.372 --> 06:39.332
and there is a place in between, another thought rises and fall.

06:39.532 --> 06:45.292
You are in the center of these thoughts. The Vilamba as we call it.

06:45.492 --> 06:53.412
The time where you pause. Then you will understand Christ.

06:55.572 --> 07:01.332
He was here, partly of course to save us,

07:01.732 --> 07:04.132
because He had many aspects I should say,

07:04.332 --> 07:08.332
not only to save human beings He came on this earth.

07:09.692 --> 07:12.652
There were many more aspects,

07:12.852 --> 07:16.532
this is also human beings have a demand, you see

07:16.732 --> 07:22.412
that that they must be saved, why?

07:22.892 --> 07:26.332
One shouldn’t. I Mean from God’s angle if you see,

07:26.572 --> 07:29.572
why should they be saved all of them?

07:29.892 --> 07:33.892
What have they done for God?

07:34.892 --> 07:38.812
How can you demand God that “You must save us?”

07:39.012 --> 07:46.452
Can you? You cannot ask for that.

07:48.652 --> 07:58.892
So He did come to create the passage between as you see here,

07:59.252 --> 08:05.892
the Vishudhi and the Sahastrara, this Agnya.

08:06.532 --> 08:12.052
In the primordial being the Virat – He was born there,

08:12.492 --> 08:16.492
to open that door.

08:17.252 --> 08:22.932
In evolution, every incarnation has come on this earth

08:23.172 --> 08:29.652
to open a particular door within us and to create

08:29.972 --> 08:35.852
that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness.

08:36.092 --> 08:43.052
So Christ came precisely for opening this small little door,

08:43.332 --> 08:49.092
which is constricted by our ego and superego.

08:49.372 --> 08:57.172
Ego and superego are the two byproducts of our thought process.

08:57.492 --> 09:02.092
One the thoughts, that are of the past and the other,

09:02.292 --> 09:04.372
thoughts of the future.

09:04.612 --> 09:12.412
He came to make that gap, to cross that gap,

09:13.972 --> 09:25.732
and that’s how He has sacrificed Himself, His body.

09:30.092 --> 09:40.452
For you it is a very big thing of remorse and repentance,

09:40.852 --> 09:47.372
but for such people it is not, it’s a play.

09:47.732 --> 09:51.732
They have to play a certain role.

09:51.932 --> 09:54.732
That’s why I do not understand why do you show Him to be

09:54.932 --> 09:56.852
such a lanky, panky, miserable creature.

09:57.052 --> 10:01.452
He was never miserable.

10:01.812 --> 10:04.052
Such people can never be miserable as you are.

10:04.252 --> 10:08.252
This is another concept of man, that He should be lanky, panky,

10:08.452 --> 10:16.412
tally, skinny, starved, bones coming out, count them one by one.

10:16.612 --> 10:20.612
Horrible! I tell you.

10:21.772 --> 10:27.372
From His childhood to His death He was jolly person,

10:27.692 --> 10:35.412
He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy,

10:35.692 --> 10:38.572
to give you the

10:38.772 --> 10:43.972
light of happiness by enlightening your source of joy,

10:44.212 --> 10:46.612
that is your spirit in your heart.

10:46.812 --> 10:52.012
That He came on this earth – not only to save you –

10:52.212 --> 10:56.692
first to give you happiness, to give you joy.

10:56.892 --> 11:02.292
Because human beings in their ignorance and in this tomfoolery,

11:02.572 --> 11:07.052
are unnecessarily beating themselves and destroying themselves.

11:07.412 --> 11:13.452
When nobody asked you to go to pubs to get into trouble;

11:14.172 --> 11:18.172
nobody has asked you to go to races and become bankrupts;

11:18.572 --> 11:24.052
nobody has asked you to go to horrible gurus and get into troubles.

11:24.292 --> 11:27.572
But you seek your destruction morning till evening.

11:27.772 --> 11:35.652
Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy.

11:37.452 --> 11:42.772
First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child.

11:42.972 --> 11:44.932
You see any child at least I know Myself,

11:45.132 --> 11:47.692
I don’t know about the funny people here I mean,

11:47.892 --> 11:50.092
for them flowers also look like thorns,

11:50.292 --> 11:52.852
I mean I don’t know how they manage that stuff.

11:53.092 --> 11:56.052
But you see a child anywhere, any child,

11:56.332 --> 11:58.772
such a joy giving thing it is.

11:58.972 --> 12:02.972
And this is the child of the divine –

12:03.332 --> 12:07.332
that comes on this earth as a child –

12:08.132 --> 12:11.332
is the most joy giving thing.

12:11.772 --> 12:16.372
And that’s why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe

12:16.612 --> 12:22.772
should be a festival of great joy.

12:23.212 --> 12:29.972
For He brought light for us by which you could see

12:30.292 --> 12:35.052
that there is someone called as “God.”

12:35.252 --> 12:39.212
There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance.

12:39.412 --> 12:43.412
This was the first beginning.

12:50.332 --> 12:55.732
So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy

12:55.932 --> 13:03.452
and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take.

13:04.532 --> 13:09.332
Because divine life doesn’t make you serious.

13:09.532 --> 13:15.332
Because it’s all a play, it’s a maya.

13:17.852 --> 13:23.692
I have seen in all the rituals that people follow,

13:23.892 --> 13:26.052
in all the so called religious people,

13:26.252 --> 13:29.612
they are too serious to be religious.

13:29.892 --> 13:33.092
And religious person is bubbling with laughter.

13:33.292 --> 13:36.092
He doesn’t know how to hide his joy.

13:36.292 --> 13:41.332
And he doesn’t know how to control his laughter when he sees people

13:41.532 --> 13:43.532
who are unnecessarily serious.

13:43.732 --> 13:46.652
I mean nobody’s dead. The way they people say it,

13:46.852 --> 13:49.492
it’s sometimes, you just don’t know what to do with yourself.

13:49.772 --> 13:52.172
You just can’t control.

13:52.372 --> 13:56.252
So there’s nothing in this world for a person like Christ

13:56.452 --> 13:58.132
to feel sad about.

13:58.332 --> 14:00.132
And if you really believe in Him,

14:00.332 --> 14:04.332
then please first of all give up your, this silly sadness

14:05.612 --> 14:10.812
and sulking and sitting down and becoming morose,

14:11.012 --> 14:16.492
not talking to anyone, silent bores allover.

14:17.092 --> 14:19.292
That is not the way to look at Christ.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.172
See how He went and talked to multitudes,

14:22.372 --> 14:30.412
how He opened His hands to all the people around

14:30.772 --> 14:36.372
and how He tried to give them happiness.

14:37.452 --> 14:41.812
He has said that you are to be born again.

14:42.012 --> 14:46.012
That means, He had to do this work

14:46.372 --> 14:47.772
and that you have to get it

14:47.972 --> 14:53.052
sometime He had promised that you are to be born again.

14:53.812 --> 14:56.452
Christ is to be born within us.

14:56.692 --> 15:00.652
I don’t know what Christians understand out of this.

15:00.852 --> 15:03.412
How do you become born again?

15:03.612 --> 15:06.492
Not by going through a ritual of christening,

15:06.692 --> 15:09.172
somebody coming from a theological college

15:09.372 --> 15:11.052
cannot make you a Christian.

15:11.252 --> 15:16.332
Like in our India we have some paid Brahmins,

15:16.532 --> 15:19.612
as you have here paid people you see,

15:19.972 --> 15:23.332
the whole day they will eat, drink, be merry and evening time

15:23.532 --> 15:27.532
they’ll come and pray and preach, that sort of people.

15:28.572 --> 15:35.612
You have to be a person who is authorized by God.

15:36.052 --> 15:42.172
Unless and until you are authorized by God, you cannot give joy.

15:42.372 --> 15:45.092
And that’s why I’ve seen all these people the so called…

15:45.292 --> 15:50.732
big pundits and the big… priests

15:50.932 --> 15:56.532
and all of them are so serious because they are not authorized by God.

15:59.972 --> 16:03.292
Even on a Christmas day, I mean anybody who comes from a village

16:03.492 --> 16:07.492
may think there’s a funeral going on.

16:08.372 --> 16:13.772
And after the funeral they go home. How do you celebrate?

16:13.972 --> 16:18.452
With a champagne! And after the funeral also real funeral

16:18.652 --> 16:20.372
also they’ll celebrate the… I don’t know why,

16:20.572 --> 16:24.572
but they take champagne.

16:27.772 --> 16:33.132
How can you celebrate Christ by insulting Him.

16:33.372 --> 16:35.932
He came to enlighten

16:36.132 --> 16:40.252
your awareness because He respected your awareness,

16:40.452 --> 16:45.452
the point at which it had reached, but you are trying to put it down.

16:45.652 --> 16:49.652
Is this the way to understand Him?

16:50.972 --> 16:56.492
And He has promised that you are to be baptized,

16:56.692 --> 17:00.332
you are to be born again. And now, in Sahaj Yoga,

17:00.532 --> 17:04.452
this promise is being fulfilled. So be joyous,

17:04.652 --> 17:09.132
that here at the Agnya chakra, again Christ is born within you

17:09.332 --> 17:15.572
and He’s there and you know how you can ask for his help, always.

17:16.612 --> 17:21.852
But the main thing that one has to understand,

17:22.132 --> 17:29.252
that the time has come for you to get all that is promised

17:29.572 --> 17:34.132
in the scriptures. Not only in the Bible, but all the scriptures

17:34.332 --> 17:38.132
of the world the time has come today.

17:38.332 --> 17:47.052
That you have to become a Christian, a Brahmin, a Peer,

17:47.692 --> 17:50.972
through your Kundalini awakening only.

17:51.172 --> 17:59.212
There is no other way out. And that your last judgment is also now.

18:00.132 --> 18:07.532
Only through your Kundalini awakening, God is going to judge you.

18:08.332 --> 18:11.612
How is He going to judge you otherwise, you think of somebody now.

18:11.812 --> 18:14.972
A person comes in, now here is somebody sitting to judge you.

18:15.172 --> 18:19.172
How? By how many hair dressers you have been to?

18:19.652 --> 18:22.532
Or how many suits you have stitched for the Christmas?

18:22.732 --> 18:26.692
Or what presents you have bought and how many cards you have sent?

18:26.892 --> 18:31.612
And to how many people you have

18:31.932 --> 18:36.372
sent some other things which may not be very palatable.

18:36.692 --> 18:39.612
That’s not the way.

18:40.092 --> 18:45.252
Or is it, that at what price you bought all the things?

18:45.492 --> 18:52.612
The way we are particular? Which way are we going to be judged

18:55.932 --> 18:58.652
by God?

18:58.852 --> 19:04.612
Not superficially people say, so what depth have we got, let’s see?

19:04.852 --> 19:08.852
How far can we go in our depth?

19:09.132 --> 19:15.172
At the most we reach a point where we are nothing but a concept again.

19:15.452 --> 19:18.732
So whatever depth we know goes up to only rationality

19:18.932 --> 19:21.732
up to the concept point beyond that we can not reach.

19:21.932 --> 19:25.932
So how can we be judged?

19:26.372 --> 19:32.452
How do people are judged if you go to a doctor?

19:32.692 --> 19:36.692
He has his instruments, an’ he works it out, puts the light in,

19:36.972 --> 19:41.892
sees for himself and says this is the position.

19:42.452 --> 19:49.052
And how your spirituality is going to be judged?

19:49.412 --> 19:55.292
How a seed is judged? By sprouting it!

19:55.612 --> 20:01.572
When you sprout the seed and when you see its germinating power

20:01.772 --> 20:04.012
you know it’s a good seed or a bad seed.

20:04.212 --> 20:09.612
In the same way, you will be judged by the way you are germinated,

20:09.932 --> 20:13.412
the way you receive your realization, the way you retain it,

20:13.612 --> 20:15.052
the way you respect it.

20:15.252 --> 20:18.452
That is how you are going to be judged and not by the kind of dresses

20:18.652 --> 20:20.612
you are wearing.

20:20.812 --> 20:25.572
By the type of matching you do and the hair dressing you go to.

20:25.772 --> 20:30.132
Not by the big positions you occupy and the big politicians

20:30.332 --> 20:32.452
and big bureaucrats you become.

20:32.652 --> 20:39.292
Not by what kind of houses you have built and what kind of so called

20:39.492 --> 20:42.532
Noble [sic] prizes you have won.

20:42.732 --> 20:46.372
You are not also going to be judged by your philanthropic work

20:46.572 --> 20:49.932
by that you think that you have given so much money so much so,

20:50.132 --> 20:51.972
because you, if you have given so much money

20:52.172 --> 20:56.052
there will be big ego somewhere hanging and it will bring you down

20:56.252 --> 20:58.652
your scale.

20:59.772 --> 21:03.572
This is a judgment in which

21:03.852 --> 21:09.612
the little feather is going to weigh more, much more than a ship.

21:09.852 --> 21:17.532
It’s a different type of a judgment, of a personality.

21:17.892 --> 21:23.412
You can see how Christ was judged by human beings

21:23.652 --> 21:28.732
and how He was judged by God.

21:29.052 --> 21:40.212
He came and lived in the dried straw like a feather.

21:40.572 --> 21:45.972
His mother never felt His discomfort.

21:49.772 --> 22:01.612
In the same way those who have not by there being,

22:02.412 --> 22:10.932
oppressed others or taken oppression, are going to be judged

22:11.372 --> 22:15.372
as first class.

22:16.132 --> 22:20.572
In the Kundalini awakening itself there are inherent defects.

22:20.812 --> 22:24.652
Inherently the Kundalini has some defects,

22:24.852 --> 22:28.852
because of your previous karmas.

22:30.172 --> 22:33.732
Because what you have been doing in this lifetime.

22:33.932 --> 22:40.172
Because, the things that you have accepted as

22:41.372 --> 22:44.692
reality, which is just a concept.

22:44.892 --> 22:48.452
Because, when you have not known the absolute,

22:48.692 --> 22:50.332
whatever you will be doing,

22:50.532 --> 22:54.532
there will be a little of ignorance with it.

22:55.012 --> 22:56.932
Whatever you have done in darkness

22:57.132 --> 23:01.132
will have a particle of darkness in it.

23:01.532 --> 23:05.492
So without knowing realization if you have propagated,

23:05.692 --> 23:10.772
“Oh, we are great saints, this that,” you’ll have no chance.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.292
If you think you are a very divine personality,

23:14.492 --> 23:19.692
and you are already a realized soul, no chances!

23:20.332 --> 23:23.012
All the priests of all the religions,

23:23.212 --> 23:28.172
will be the last to get realization.

23:29.732 --> 23:34.732
Valmiki in his Ramayana, has very clearly said,

23:34.932 --> 23:39.532
a very interesting story is there, that, a dog was asked

23:39.732 --> 23:42.412
what do you want to be in your next life?

23:42.612 --> 23:47.172
So he told “make me anything but don’t make me a Mathadhish.”

23:47.412 --> 23:51.412
A person. Mathadhish is a person like a “priesthood.”

23:51.812 --> 23:57.692
So make me everything but not a priest anywhere.

23:58.132 --> 24:03.172
Just imagine a dog having that wisdom.

24:05.132 --> 24:09.652
But I do not say that all of them are like that.

24:09.932 --> 24:12.172
There may be some who are really genuine,

24:12.372 --> 24:16.692
some may be really realized people, may be authorized by God.

24:16.892 --> 24:19.812
But I am sure they are not accepted, by the multitude,

24:20.012 --> 24:24.132
I am sure of that. Because I have seen your history and all that,

24:24.332 --> 24:29.972
I’ve seen all such people have been discarded and have been tortured.

24:30.692 --> 24:40.452
But now the time has come… to judge the right and the wrong.

24:41.652 --> 24:47.052
You cannot crucify anymore. you cannot.

24:47.412 --> 24:52.892
Everyone is going to be judged through Kundalini awakening.

24:53.132 --> 25:00.772
Now, we should know there are three categories of human beings.

25:02.092 --> 25:04.652
I don’t know which way to start, not to shock you,

25:04.852 --> 25:12.052
one is human beings as we are, normal. They are called as Narayoni.

25:12.412 --> 25:14.972
The second categories are Devayoni.

25:15.172 --> 25:18.052
Those who are born seekers or realized souls,

25:18.252 --> 25:21.332
mostly realized souls are Devayoni.

25:21.532 --> 25:26.292
And the third ones are called as Rakshas. These are called as Ganas.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.452
Actually these are called as Ganas.

25:28.652 --> 25:34.172
But is the We can say the species among human beings are Rakshasas.

25:34.372 --> 25:37.292
Means the people who are evil.

25:37.692 --> 25:43.412
So we have evil people, excellent people,

25:43.612 --> 25:51.292
and we have in-between people. Excellent people are very few.

25:51.492 --> 25:56.372
They are born realized. I don’t have their problem much.

25:56.652 --> 26:01.612
But one has to deal with the people who are in the center.

26:01.812 --> 26:10.532
They are looking towards good but have something hanging on to them,

26:10.732 --> 26:13.052
which is not so good.

26:13.332 --> 26:17.532
So for these people, there are inherently some defects

26:17.732 --> 26:21.052
in the Kundalini, which we must understand.

26:21.252 --> 26:27.292
The first of them is bad health,

26:27.652 --> 26:34.052
physical bad health, actual physical bad health.

26:35.772 --> 26:42.492
In this country specially people suffer from too much of cold

26:42.852 --> 26:47.092
and other troubles due to over calcium in the water,

26:47.292 --> 26:51.212
in the same way according to the countries,

26:51.412 --> 26:54.732
stanavishesh as they call it, you have your problems.

26:54.932 --> 26:57.652
Like in our country we have some problems;

26:57.852 --> 26:59.812
like in your country you have certain problems.

27:00.012 --> 27:04.252
So, the physical problems are according to the country

27:04.452 --> 27:05.692
where you have taken your birth.

27:05.892 --> 27:12.092
Most of you have decided to take birth in particular countries.

27:13.972 --> 27:18.412
That’s why you are identified also to such an extent sometimes

27:18.612 --> 27:22.492
that you think there is no defect.

27:22.692 --> 27:28.332
Every country has a variety by which you suffer a certain

27:28.532 --> 27:32.172
amount of setback in your health.

27:32.732 --> 27:34.972
So for a Sahaj Yogi

27:35.172 --> 27:39.372
one should know that health is a very important thing.

27:39.572 --> 27:42.332
Because this body is the temple of God,

27:42.532 --> 27:45.132
and one has to look after your health.

27:45.332 --> 27:48.292
And you know also when the Kundalini rises the first thing that

27:48.492 --> 27:50.972
happens that your health improves.

27:51.172 --> 27:54.012
Because of the parasympathetic fulfillment.

27:54.212 --> 28:00.572
Because parasympathetic gives you enlightenment

28:00.772 --> 28:06.732
which flows into sympathetic and your health improves.

28:08.092 --> 28:12.372
I will not tell about it very elaborately today because time is short.

28:12.572 --> 28:17.852
But, if you read My..I would say I haven’t yet written much,

28:18.052 --> 28:20.492
but if you listen to My lectures,

28:20.692 --> 28:23.292
and some of them which are written down,

28:23.492 --> 28:30.172
you will know how Kundalini helps to cure most of the diseases,

28:30.412 --> 28:37.852
except for which are being tampered by human elements,

28:38.052 --> 28:41.892
like a kidney trouble now has been cured by Sahaj Yoga.

28:42.092 --> 28:45.212
No doubt, we can cure kidney trouble.

28:45.452 --> 28:48.812
But a person who has been on the machine, we’ve tried,

28:49.012 --> 28:50.692
cannot be cured.

28:50.892 --> 28:54.892
We can give him longevity, but he cannot be cured.

28:55.212 --> 28:59.332
But to cure people is not your job at all by any chance,

28:59.532 --> 29:00.572
you must remember this.

29:00.772 --> 29:03.812
No Sahaj Yogi should take to curing people.

29:04.012 --> 29:06.532
They can use my photograph.

29:06.732 --> 29:11.052
But not to take to curing, because it means you are a big

29:11.252 --> 29:13.572
philanthropic personality.

29:13.812 --> 29:16.892
I have seen people who have been curing,

29:17.212 --> 29:20.452
get into such a mania of curing,

29:20.652 --> 29:23.692
that they forget that they are also catching something and

29:23.892 --> 29:26.532
they are also getting some troubles and they never cure them self,

29:26.732 --> 29:32.012
ultimately I find they get out of Sahaj Yoga.

29:33.092 --> 29:36.332
But with the Photograph you can cure people.

29:36.532 --> 29:41.892
Do not think that it is your duty that you are a great sort-of-a…

29:42.092 --> 29:48.972
what you call a… benefactor, physical benefactor, no, you are not.

29:49.292 --> 29:53.292
You are a spiritual benefactor but as a byproduct,

29:54.012 --> 29:59.932
the body of the person improves because if

30:00.132 --> 30:03.532
Christ has to be awakened,

30:03.772 --> 30:11.572
if God has to come in this body, then this body is to be cleansed.

30:12.212 --> 30:16.212
It is done by Kundalini.

30:16.612 --> 30:23.932
But it does not have a separate work like hospitals.

30:24.372 --> 30:28.572
I have known people who went so mad with their power of curing that

30:28.772 --> 30:32.772
they started visiting regularly the hospitals,

30:32.972 --> 30:36.532
and they ended up in the hospital only.

30:36.732 --> 30:39.372
They would not even come to programs;

30:39.572 --> 30:42.012
they would not even come and see Me.

30:42.212 --> 30:44.852
So this is one of the greatest hurdles you have got

30:45.052 --> 30:52.452
is the Vyadhi, is the bodily elements.

30:54.292 --> 31:00.172
And the bodily element also should not take you down too much.

31:00.412 --> 31:03.332
If we have some problem, forget it.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.972
Gradually it will improve, with some people it takes time

31:06.172 --> 31:07.932
to get all right.

31:08.132 --> 31:12.892
But the main thing is, to get to your spirit.

31:13.092 --> 31:18.572
So do not always say “Mother, cure me, cure me, cure me.”

31:18.852 --> 31:22.052
But just say “Mother give me the spiritual life,”

31:22.252 --> 31:25.812
and you will be cured automatically.

31:26.052 --> 31:30.052
It may take time in some people, doesn’t matter.

31:30.252 --> 31:32.892
You have been sick all your life, doesn’t matter.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.772
Little more time.

31:36.092 --> 31:39.292
And also follow the methods which [I HAVE …del] we have told,

31:39.492 --> 31:46.172
about different diseases, specially liver in this country, colds,

31:46.452 --> 31:50.372
and what you call this gout and all these troubles.

31:50.572 --> 31:55.612
We have remedies for all this. Diabetes, we have,

31:55.932 --> 32:05.772
but work it out as a duty towards your body, towards the temple.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.692
But that should not be the end of your life,

32:10.892 --> 32:13.252
that’s a very little part.

32:13.452 --> 32:17.212
I mean it would be something like cleaning the whole place…

32:17.412 --> 32:19.932
and then you get out of it. They say “Why did you clean?”

32:20.132 --> 32:23.452
Like I have seen here people, you see, even we were in Oxstead

32:23.652 --> 32:26.932
I was surprised, you see everybody used to polish everything you know,

32:27.132 --> 32:31.572
and everything was, sort of, lawn was done very well

32:31.772 --> 32:34.932
and everything cleaned very well, and not even a rat would enter

32:35.132 --> 32:36.172
their houses even.

32:36.372 --> 32:39.772
For months together I never saw any person getting in,

32:39.972 --> 32:43.452
only getting out, and they were so particular.

32:43.652 --> 32:47.652
Husband wife, so particular about cleanliness, neatness, everything…

32:48.092 --> 32:50.492
and the both of them would never even talk to each other,

32:50.692 --> 32:54.812
I have seen that. There were seven houses, except for our house,

32:55.012 --> 32:57.452
and [SHE WAS …del] they were all surprised at how many people are

32:57.652 --> 32:59.852
coming to our house, they said “Are you a open house?

33:00.052 --> 33:01.652
I said “Yes, it is a open house.”

33:01.852 --> 33:05.852
They couldn’t understand what was wrong with us.

33:06.412 --> 33:08.732
Nobody would see that polished thing or anything,

33:08.932 --> 33:12.932
so, that’s how it should be that we should not go to that extent.

33:13.452 --> 33:17.572
That it becomes a sort of real “Sahaj Yoga and the rest”

33:17.772 --> 33:20.212
which is the most important is forgotten.

33:20.612 --> 33:24.612
Health will improve gradually as I have told you.

33:25.492 --> 33:29.492
But attention should be on your spirit.

33:29.892 --> 33:34.772
Attention should be on your spirit, because it is the attention,

33:35.012 --> 33:39.012
which goes into these various directions and gets stuck.

33:39.572 --> 33:42.852
You just allow it to work out and it will work out.

33:43.132 --> 33:52.612
The second hurdle which I feel, is called as akarmanyeta.

33:53.132 --> 34:01.332
Osnath, they call it. Means a person… does not want to work it out.

34:01.652 --> 34:03.692
Of course those people who are useless,

34:03.892 --> 34:06.932
who do not want to have realization, forget about them.

34:07.132 --> 34:11.052
But even after getting realization, it’s an innate problem

34:11.252 --> 34:16.532
with people that they do not want to work it out.

34:17.132 --> 34:22.212
They are lazy; in simple words, they are lazy.

34:22.412 --> 34:24.852
That is very much in this country, surprisingly.

34:25.052 --> 34:28.892
I mean the other day I saw a picture, where how, even from your

34:29.092 --> 34:35.212
country people went to Germany and blasted a complete machinery

34:35.412 --> 34:38.372
and a complete factory of that machinery which was sending

34:38.572 --> 34:41.372
pilot-less bombs.

34:41.612 --> 34:44.732
And they have overdone everything so then our children are having a

34:44.932 --> 34:54.452
nice time, perhaps. But, in Sahaj Yoga, you have to be alert .

34:55.252 --> 35:00.052
This what exactly happens in Sahaj Yoga when people come here:

35:00.332 --> 35:03.052
they get their realization, they feel the cool breeze,

35:03.252 --> 35:08.132
and is lost again. The reason is, they do not want to work it out.

35:08.332 --> 35:11.652
This is another danger, akarmanyeta.

35:11.852 --> 35:16.132
Then, when it is lost, after one year they’ll come back “Mother?

35:16.332 --> 35:19.932
We don’t believe in it, but I have got some pain in the stomach,

35:20.132 --> 35:22.532
will You cure me?”

35:23.012 --> 35:28.372
Instead of… you becoming so equipped with all the powers that you

35:28.572 --> 35:31.772
have, you become another useless person coming here,

35:31.972 --> 35:38.212
just to take My time. These powers are all within you.

35:38.412 --> 35:42.732
This is your property. This is the property of your spirit

35:42.932 --> 35:47.852
which is there inside, which is about to manifest but,

35:48.052 --> 35:54.292
because of certain hurdles that you accept, that it does not.

35:55.652 --> 35:59.092
This is akarmanyta, we can say.

35:59.412 --> 36:02.732
Which is, not working it out, not knowing about it,

36:02.932 --> 36:05.732
not understanding it, what is Sahaj Yoga is,

36:05.932 --> 36:09.092
how to manipulate this, what are these vibrations are,

36:09.292 --> 36:16.212
how it works out? People just say, “Oh! It’s too much.”

36:16.492 --> 36:19.772
Because they don’t want to face the reality.

36:20.012 --> 36:22.412
Because as soon as your Kundalini comes up,

36:22.612 --> 36:26.212
as soon as the light comes in before, the eyes are closed,

36:26.412 --> 36:29.812
you see suddenly the light comes in, you don’t want to open your eyes.

36:30.012 --> 36:33.132
Because too much we have been sleeping.

36:33.412 --> 36:35.572
Even if you open your eyes a little bit, “Oh God!”

36:35.772 --> 36:37.612
You don’t want to face the light.

36:37.812 --> 36:40.652
Because you are identified with that state,

36:40.852 --> 36:44.852
you do not want to open your eyes.

36:46.052 --> 36:50.172
Kundalini opens your eyes, no doubt, but again you close it down.

36:50.492 --> 36:56.292
So it is in your freedom, to give up that akarmanyeta.

36:56.652 --> 37:02.052
Now this is also, can be very collective, I can tell you this much.

37:02.252 --> 37:05.332
It’s a very big disease, which spreads.

37:05.532 --> 37:09.932
Like, say a husband wife is there, the wife is one like that.

37:10.132 --> 37:14.452
Instead of the husband raising the wife, he will succumb to wife,

37:14.652 --> 37:18.132
specially in the west. Just the opposite in India,

37:18.332 --> 37:22.852
because [THE del] there the husband is more dominating,

37:23.092 --> 37:26.292
the women will succumb to a husband.

37:26.532 --> 37:31.572
So what happens is, that out of the two those who have got it also

37:31.812 --> 37:33.492
are just wasted.

37:33.692 --> 37:37.052
Instead of that, both of them could be very well realized,

37:37.252 --> 37:40.892
and could be there if the one who is realized,

37:41.092 --> 37:45.532
puts down his will, that “No, I’ll keep my eyes open to see.

37:45.732 --> 37:52.292
Let me see. I must give a chance to myself.” If they accept it,

37:52.572 --> 37:57.812
then it works and then they go to the second step.

37:58.172 --> 38:03.452
Everything cannot be just like a jet liner, sit down here and…

38:03.652 --> 38:09.932
next moment you are on the… moon?

38:10.612 --> 38:13.452
Even if you are in the moon,

38:13.732 --> 38:17.172
still you may start with the third danger which is there,

38:17.372 --> 38:23.772
is sanshaya. Is the doubting.

38:24.852 --> 38:30.212
I don’t know how to describe this madness of doubting.

38:30.492 --> 38:34.812
For example, out of all of you who have been here,

38:35.012 --> 38:41.172
I would say, at least, I don’t know how much percentage…

38:41.372 --> 38:42.492
[Yogi very softly:] Ninety.

38:42.732 --> 38:45.892
[Shri Mataji:] [laughs] …have come out with the second day

38:46.092 --> 38:51.412
a very great statement “Still I am doubting.”

38:51.612 --> 38:57.652
Is that the sign of wisdom? What are you doubting?

38:59.292 --> 39:03.292
What have you found out so far?

39:03.892 --> 39:07.092
From where does this come?

39:07.332 --> 39:12.812
Is Mr. Ego, about which I have given lectures after lectures.

39:13.132 --> 39:16.932
Is Mr. Ego that is doubting it?

39:17.132 --> 39:19.492
Because he doesn’t want you to find the absolute.

39:19.692 --> 39:23.092
You are identified with your Ego,

39:23.292 --> 39:25.852
and you do not want to find it because,

39:26.052 --> 39:29.412
this Mr. Ego has been guiding your life throughout,

39:29.652 --> 39:33.652
and now [YOU DON’T …del] you want to doubt. Doubt what?

39:34.652 --> 39:41.132
What are you doubting? You felt the cool breeze, all right?

39:41.412 --> 39:42.572
Sit down then.

39:42.772 --> 39:45.852
It would be something like somebody entering into a college,

39:46.052 --> 39:50.852
university, and they are going sitting down firstly there,

39:51.092 --> 39:54.812
teacher says “Now, this is the diagram, I give you.”

39:55.012 --> 40:00.172
The students get up and say, “Sir we doubt.” Really?

40:00.492 --> 40:04.492
Then what should the teacher say. But they will not say that,

40:04.692 --> 40:11.932
because they have paid the fees. They have paid it.

40:12.372 --> 40:16.732
Even if it is a horrible drama, boring one,

40:16.932 --> 40:19.612
still we go through it because we have paid, you see?

40:19.812 --> 40:25.172
To go through it “After all, we have paid it,” you see? What to do?

40:26.012 --> 40:30.012
But for Sahaj Yoga you cannot pay.

40:31.332 --> 40:36.452
I have seen all kinds of tomfoolery people accept in so many gurus.

40:36.812 --> 40:40.412
Like somebody says “I am going to teach you how to fly.”

40:40.652 --> 40:43.612
They’re absolutely ready for that.

40:43.812 --> 40:46.692
They’ll pay money, and not doubt, even a bit,

40:46.892 --> 40:49.812
that the fellow who is propagating is he flying?

40:50.012 --> 40:51.532
Have you seen him flying anywhere?

40:51.732 --> 40:54.332
Please at least ask that person to fly.

40:54.532 --> 40:57.612
They will see the Kundalini rising with their eyes,

40:57.812 --> 41:00.652
they will see it pulsating, rising, breaking here,

41:00.852 --> 41:03.212
still they’ll sit down and say “I am doubting.”

41:03.412 --> 41:07.732
Now who are you? How far have you reached?

41:08.012 --> 41:12.012
Why are you doubting? What are you doubting?

41:12.852 --> 41:15.292
What have you known so far about yourself?

41:15.492 --> 41:20.772
Now, humble down yourself at this point Humble down in your heart.

41:21.012 --> 41:27.412
“No I have not known myself. I have to know myself.

41:28.132 --> 41:31.772
I have not known myself, I haven’t got the absolute.

41:31.972 --> 41:33.892
With what instruments I am doubting?”

41:34.092 --> 41:37.692
This is one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini awakening

41:37.892 --> 41:42.652
and in after awakening, called as Samshaya.

41:42.932 --> 41:46.812
[THE SECOND …del] The fourth one we can call it as Pramaada,

41:47.012 --> 41:53.572
is the one by which we go on faltering all the time…

41:55.172 --> 42:00.212
foolish questions. I mean there are certain things one has to follow,

42:00.412 --> 42:02.692
if you are going on the road you see,

42:02.892 --> 42:06.292
you are used to say continental driving,

42:06.492 --> 42:10.612
so always you turn on the wrong side,

42:10.812 --> 42:14.372
but in London you will be arrested.

42:14.572 --> 42:18.572
In the same way so far you have been doing continental driving.

42:18.932 --> 42:26.292
Now you are in London, so you better take to the ways of Londoners

42:26.492 --> 42:31.132
and understand the roads and the maps and the regulations

42:31.332 --> 42:37.572
that are needed, and try to follow them. But you are doubting it.

42:37.852 --> 42:42.132
That’s the main point. Then you don’t want to follow it.

42:42.332 --> 42:45.892
So the pramad is the mistakes that arise,

42:46.092 --> 42:53.812
because Kundalini awakening is a free gift to anyone who comes here.

42:55.252 --> 43:02.972
To anyone who has been to any sort of hell or heaven or has done…

43:03.172 --> 43:04.612
[Break in original recording, end of tape side 1]

43:04.812 --> 43:11.612
point about it. And why do you doubt. You are not paying any money.

43:12.092 --> 43:14.212
These two things go hand in hand –

43:14.412 --> 43:18.732
doubting and pramad is the mistakes that we commit throughout.

43:18.932 --> 43:21.892
Because we are doubting, that’s why we do not take it up seriously,

43:22.092 --> 43:24.172
we do not understand it – the rule of the road –

43:24.372 --> 43:32.772
and we just start driving. And then we have accidents.

43:33.332 --> 43:38.372
And then when we have accidents we blame Mataji for that.

43:40.892 --> 43:47.012
That is a very-very, common thing that happens,

43:47.292 --> 43:50.692
that we blame Sahaj Yoga.

43:51.052 --> 43:53.732
We blame that spontaneous happening within us;

43:53.932 --> 43:56.172
we never take the blame upon ourselves,

43:56.372 --> 43:59.212
that “No, I must have done this mistake.” All right, doesn’t matter,

43:59.412 --> 44:03.412
if I make mistakes I will rectify, it’s all right.

44:04.572 --> 44:09.332
Mother is forgiving, no doubt, I forgive,

44:09.612 --> 44:12.092
but sometimes my forgiveness is also of no use

44:12.292 --> 44:15.212
because unless and until you realize that it was a mistake

44:15.412 --> 44:18.092
you should go this way instead of that you have gone that way,

44:18.292 --> 44:22.292
so rule of the road is to be understood.

44:22.652 --> 44:27.572
That is the one comes to us, called as pramad.

44:27.772 --> 44:34.212
After that, we have another inherent problem is called as

44:34.412 --> 44:38.892
Bhramadarshan, hallucinations.

44:39.292 --> 44:42.412
We start seeing hallucinations, specially with people who take

44:42.612 --> 44:44.692
LSD and all [THE …del] such things.

44:44.892 --> 44:48.892
They don’t see Me sometimes they just see lights.

44:49.652 --> 44:54.892
Or any such hallucinations you see of the future or of the past.

44:55.172 --> 44:56.932
They may see Me as something else

44:57.132 --> 44:58.892
and they may see Me as something else.

44:59.092 --> 45:01.292
If you see Me in dreams is all right,

45:01.492 --> 45:03.652
or see something in dreams is all right.

45:03.852 --> 45:10.852
But you start seeing some things, that’s called as Bhramadarsha.

45:11.052 --> 45:16.012
Bhrama means illusion. Then you start developing illusions.

45:16.252 --> 45:21.412
But the worst part of it is that people start telling lies about it.

45:21.932 --> 45:28.652
I know about everyone. And when this bhramadarshan starts,

45:28.852 --> 45:33.732
it’s the most dangerous thing about vibrations also.

45:33.972 --> 45:40.492
Some people are absolutely cocksure about themselves, I see that.

45:40.972 --> 45:44.412
And they’ll tell all the world, you see they’ll dominate everybody

45:44.612 --> 45:46.212
saying that “The vibrations of this is not good,

45:46.412 --> 45:47.932
the vibrations of that is not good,”

45:48.132 --> 45:51.972
while they have no mastery over it.

45:52.172 --> 45:54.612
Now if I, somehow or the other,

45:54.852 --> 45:58.012
see I have to be very careful I can’t talk like a teacher,

45:58.212 --> 46:01.252
so I somehow or other say that “All right, you give yourself a bandhan

46:01.452 --> 46:03.412
and now you put your hands towards me and you see for yourself,”

46:03.612 --> 46:04.852
and all that.

46:05.052 --> 46:12.092
If they by any chance know that I’ve found out, that they are lying,

46:12.332 --> 46:14.492
then they are finished.

46:14.732 --> 46:19.372
I must keep up their falsehood everything in me.

46:19.652 --> 46:22.972
In by chance you see, I am very careful though because I know

46:23.172 --> 46:25.332
they are always on a slippery ground,

46:25.532 --> 46:33.292
so even if I mention in a way that is not so blunt or anything,

46:33.492 --> 46:40.492
still it might happen. But one must know that it is for our good,

46:40.852 --> 46:46.212
that we have to stick on to the truth. And we should not be led away

46:46.452 --> 46:51.572
by our own ideas about ourselves.

46:55.332 --> 47:02.692
Then [THE – del] another thing comes is – Vishaychitta.

47:03.012 --> 47:06.652
In which the attention is attracted by objects

47:06.852 --> 47:10.732
of your previous identification.

47:10.932 --> 47:14.412
Like your attention has been, “You see I’m very found of cricket,”

47:14.612 --> 47:20.252
“all right, you are.” But you should not be a sick person.

47:20.532 --> 47:25.932
I mean cricket doesn’t mean that you become a cricket bat.

47:26.212 --> 47:28.292
And you are good for nothing for anything else,

47:28.492 --> 47:31.292
for all practical purposes you are dead.

47:31.492 --> 47:37.932
That kind of craziness, for anything whatsoever,

47:38.452 --> 47:41.972
gets your attention into a very wrong state,

47:42.172 --> 47:44.972
and is also not good for all the Sahaj Yogis.

47:45.172 --> 47:48.012
Today’s lecture is more for the Sahaj Yogi.

47:48.212 --> 47:53.892
So I am pointing out what are the inherent dangers of

47:54.172 --> 48:01.452
sustaining our realization. Which is very important to understand.

48:02.892 --> 48:08.172
Now the two other very big dangers which we suffer from,

48:08.372 --> 48:10.892
apart from that the people get possessed

48:11.132 --> 48:13.612
and get ideas into their heads,

48:13.812 --> 48:18.212
they start singing songs, this that Sometimes I am so embarrassed,

48:18.412 --> 48:22.292
I don’t know what to say, I can see a devil speaking through them,

48:22.492 --> 48:25.292
but I just don’t know how to tell them that “Oh please stop.”

48:25.492 --> 48:28.892
Even praising Me I know what it is.

48:29.092 --> 48:32.972
But they’ll just come up and say, “Mother, we want to sing a song to

48:33.172 --> 48:36.212
you.” “All right, finished.” I can not say anything,

48:36.412 --> 48:39.292
because they do not know what they are singing.

48:39.492 --> 48:42.132
They do not know from where did they get this knowledge.

48:42.332 --> 48:46.332
It’s something else doing this.

48:48.332 --> 48:52.332
Because of all these problems that you get possessed,

48:53.092 --> 48:55.252
the other day somebody came to me and said,

48:55.452 --> 48:59.692
that “Mother I’m feeling very overconfident about myself and cocksure.”

48:59.892 --> 49:03.092
“Really?”“And I feel like doing something very high handed,”

49:03.292 --> 49:10.892
and he did it. First he saw the possession coming in to him.

49:11.492 --> 49:15.772
And then he did it, and did it in a very bad way.

49:15.972 --> 49:21.652
Everybody’s angry with him. I know, but I’m not.

49:21.892 --> 49:24.492
Because something is done in possession,

49:24.692 --> 49:29.092
you don’t know what madness people can do when they get possessed.

49:29.332 --> 49:32.372
I mean they should end up in lunatic asylum, but because of being

49:32.572 --> 49:36.132
Sahaj Yogis, they do all these things.

49:36.332 --> 49:41.612
But still they are not stationed where they should be.

49:44.292 --> 49:47.812
Then there are two more stages in which,

49:48.172 --> 49:52.452
a Kundalini which rises also falls down.

49:52.652 --> 49:57.132
This is an inherent danger in a person. Many people have asked Me

49:57.332 --> 50:01.172
that “Mother, if we get realization does it stay?”

50:01.372 --> 50:06.652
It does stay, part of it. Sometimes it is very thin part of it,

50:06.852 --> 50:12.412
sometimes the whole thing is sucked back. It is sucked back.

50:12.732 --> 50:15.372
Is so, then you will say “Then we start doubting.”

50:15.572 --> 50:20.332
Where is it written that, “You will be lifted up

50:20.532 --> 50:27.452
and put into something great, whatever may be your problems.”

50:27.692 --> 50:31.452
Is it possible? Even from here if I have to go to India,

50:31.652 --> 50:35.132
I have to get inoculations and vaccinations,

50:35.332 --> 50:40.972
and I have to get My passport, go through an interview…

50:41.172 --> 50:45.172
While if you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

50:45.372 --> 50:49.932
then you are going to be judged, not only judged,

50:50.132 --> 50:54.052
but even when supposing you give a grace mark and all that

50:54.252 --> 50:57.172
and a person is allowed to sort of, get into the plane,

50:57.372 --> 51:01.812
may be that they may ask you to get down. Is possible.

51:02.132 --> 51:07.252
And that happens with some people that the Kundalini falls down.

51:07.572 --> 51:13.292
Is very, very dangerous sign. It comes through many problems

51:13.492 --> 51:19.132
like gurus and, going to wrong places also going to spirits

51:19.332 --> 51:26.892
and doing all black magic and, also bowing before people who are not

51:27.172 --> 51:33.332
incarnations, worshipping wrong type of deities and also doing

51:33.532 --> 51:39.692
mad rituals. Fasting at wrong times and not understanding

51:39.892 --> 51:44.572
the signs of fasting and of ritualism and chakras and the

51:44.772 --> 51:49.692
connection a complete synthesis of Sahaj Yoga.

51:50.252 --> 51:54.652
And it falls down. In some people you have seen that Kundalini rises

51:54.852 --> 51:58.812
and immediately falls down is a very, very dangerous thing which

51:59.012 --> 52:01.572
really is very troublesome also.

52:01.772 --> 52:05.772
But still one can fix it up.

52:06.292 --> 52:11.252
Last danger that we have which one should know that you start feeling

52:11.452 --> 52:17.732
that you have become God or some like an incarnation or something.

52:18.132 --> 52:22.012
This is the biggest danger. And then you start taking law into your

52:22.212 --> 52:30.172
own hands and start rebuking others or… doing all kind of highhanded

52:30.372 --> 52:37.932
business. Or getting over self-satisfied with yourself.

52:38.212 --> 52:40.572
This is a very big danger.

52:40.852 --> 52:48.212
Humility is the only way, to know that there’s an ocean before you.

52:48.492 --> 52:53.852
You have got into the boat all right, but you have to know a lot,

52:54.132 --> 52:59.292
you have to understand a lot, and you have to still attend to your

52:59.492 --> 53:04.252
attention, to your chitta, to your awareness.

53:04.532 --> 53:09.012
And you have to still work it out in such a way

53:09.212 --> 53:16.372
that you really establish your self, as a full-fledged Sahaj Yogi

53:16.572 --> 53:20.572
by which collectivity becomes a part and parcel of your being.

53:20.772 --> 53:24.452
By which you have no doubts left.

53:24.652 --> 53:28.932
From thoughtless awareness you jump into doubtless awareness.

53:29.132 --> 53:33.052
Unless and until that happens within you, is not mind,

53:33.252 --> 53:36.252
but is a state in which only the Kundalini will rise,

53:36.452 --> 53:38.932
whenever you’ll raise your hands.

53:39.132 --> 53:42.212
Unless and until you have achieved that state,

53:42.452 --> 53:49.292
please try to work it out, don’t be lazy.

53:49.492 --> 53:52.972
You have to see around yourself, meet people, talk to them,

53:53.172 --> 53:56.492
the more you talk about it the more you do it the more you give it,

53:56.732 --> 53:58.772
the more it will flow.

53:59.052 --> 54:03.052
The more you sit at home, “Oh, I am doing my puja at home.” Nothing.

54:03.732 --> 54:07.572
It will stagnate and stagnate. You have to give it to others,

54:07.772 --> 54:11.772
you have to think of others. Thousands of them have to have it.

54:12.412 --> 54:16.772
And that’s why it is important that don’t get bloated with the idea

54:16.972 --> 54:20.412
that you have all the powers of the world, already manifesting.

54:20.612 --> 54:21.852
Never.

54:22.052 --> 54:26.852
When these powers really manifest you are really not aware of them.

54:27.092 --> 54:32.932
Absolutely. I mean imagine the Sun saying “I am The Sun.”

54:33.252 --> 54:36.132
Will he say so? When he is the Sun, what is there?

54:36.332 --> 54:38.092
If you go and ask the Sun “Are you The Sun?”

54:38.292 --> 54:42.292
He said “Yes, by the way I am, what can I do about it?”

54:43.652 --> 54:46.692
It’s that simple, you know you become a very simple person,

54:46.892 --> 54:51.092
absolutely simple, because there is no…

54:51.292 --> 54:56.172
camouflage, there’s no complication. You are that.

54:57.332 --> 55:01.772
So, anybody asks you funny questions you say, “By the way,

55:01.972 --> 55:04.692
what is there to ask?, It is so. I mean, if I am a realized soul,

55:04.892 --> 55:08.892
I am, what does it matter?”

55:11.572 --> 55:16.932
With this understanding we have to go to Sahaj Yoga,

55:17.132 --> 55:23.532
which I must say I am surprised, how it is working, miraculously.

55:24.652 --> 55:28.932
And it is working out, but it is you who can settle it,

55:29.132 --> 55:36.492
within yourself. Now, among you some are only on the periphery.

55:36.852 --> 55:40.492
We keep them on periphery also, that you know very well.

55:40.772 --> 55:43.572
Some of them come in the center.

55:43.852 --> 55:49.612
And some are very few, who are in the inner circle.

55:49.812 --> 55:54.852
All of them are still in a state where they can be thrown out,

55:55.092 --> 55:57.212
like a tangent go down, you see?

55:57.412 --> 56:00.772
And then you don’t understand why a Sahaj Yogi behaves like that.

56:00.972 --> 56:04.052
If you see some Sahaj Yogi behaving like that, going in a tangent

56:04.252 --> 56:08.252
know that you might do the same. So be careful.

56:09.092 --> 56:16.932
So, today, at this juncture, when we are celebrating the great event

56:17.132 --> 56:21.132
of Christ’ life, let us know that Christ is born within us,

56:21.372 --> 56:25.372
and the Bethlehem is within us.

56:26.572 --> 56:30.252
You don’t have to go to Bethlehem it’s within us.

56:30.452 --> 56:38.372
He is there, and we have to look after it. It’s still a child.

56:38.932 --> 56:44.292
You have to respect it, and you have to look after it.

56:44.612 --> 56:47.812
So the light… really glows

56:48.012 --> 56:52.932
and people know that you are realized souls.

56:53.132 --> 56:56.292
Nobody will doubt that you are not.

56:56.382 --> 57:02.942
May God bless you, all.
