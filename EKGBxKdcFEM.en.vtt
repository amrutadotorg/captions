00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:06.620
It's all right.

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:22.298
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:28.277
At the very outset

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.822
we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.036
We cannot change it,

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.841
we cannot conceptualize it,

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.005
with this human awareness.

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:47.129
We have to be in another state

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:52.437
where we can understand it, know it,

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:56.577
on our central nervous system.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.713
Whatever we have achieved in our evolutionary process

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:06.253
we can feel it

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:10.266
on our central nervous system.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.445
In the same way

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.552
we have to feel

00:01:19.752 --> 00:01:25.716
the truth, the absolute, on our finger tips.

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.530
It has to be tangible.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.530
It's not a make belief, it's not a blind faith,

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:41.030
but one has to experience it, on the central nervous system.

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:45.062
But the problem is that so far,

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:49.863
those who achieved something also of this nature,

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:56.006
were singled out and they were never respected.

00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:02.664
A great poet, Kabir, says that,

00:02:02.864 --> 00:02:08.547
"How am I to explain anything? The people are so blind."

00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:17.332
Even William Blake was treated as a lunatic in this country.

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:25.811
It was impossible for these seers, these prophets,

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:31.475
to explain, to talk about the Divine.

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:38.449
But, till they lived, nobody understood them and followed them.

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:42.624
And then when they were no more,

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:48.691
people built mosques, temples, churches.

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:54.741
And when we see the mess of these religions we are surprised,

00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:57.056
how can it be.

00:02:57.256 --> 00:03:02.218
How can people kill each other in the name of God?

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.797
How can they make money,

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.778
the way they are making in the name of God?

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:15.296
People are amazed, who are little bit aware,

00:03:15.543 --> 00:03:18.644
that there's something wrong somewhere.

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:22.689
And whatever was

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.179
told was not followed properly.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.307
There is no connection.

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:32.486
One starts feeling, when they see the private lives of people

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:35.495
who are in charge of those religions,

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:38.464
that there's something definitely wrong.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.942
So then, they take to science.

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:48.373
And science is amoral. It has no morality.

00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:51.345
It deals with matter,

00:03:51.545 --> 00:03:54.993
and matter is controlled by the Divine.

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:59.493
It cannot deliver the goods

00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:05.705
as far as our spirituality is concerned

00:04:05.906 --> 00:04:09.531
about knowing the Absolute.

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:15.555
So we are stuck at a point where we call ourselves human beings,

00:04:15.786 --> 00:04:18.294
we have the human awareness.

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:22.221
But we don't have the absolute knowledge,

00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:27.873
that's why everybody is quarrelling, fighting, wars,

00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:32.114
in some name or other we are hating each other.

00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:37.798
If the Divine has created all of us,

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:41.245
why there is such a problem?

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.601
In the nature there isn't.

00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:46.843
Look at these beautiful flowers here.

00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:50.793
On the tree, they grow,

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:53.421
all the leaves are spread properly.

00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:57.550
No problem, nobody tries to aggress anyone or to kill anybody.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.909
Everybody, if you call them some bodies,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.531
then they all help each other to get the maximum sunlight.

00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:13.132
You go in a forest,

00:05:13.347 --> 00:05:16.843
there may be a tiger and all kinds of animals there,

00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:20.450
you don't have any bad smell anywhere. They know how to,

00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:24.342
the whole cycle of nature is worked out beautifully.

00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:30.300
But if you feel that there's some dirt filth and you smell it,

00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:34.252
then know there must be some human beings living there.

00:05:34.452 --> 00:05:39.182
Because men only have the power as human beings,

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:46.392
to spoil everything,

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:54.239
or to become the Spirit.

00:05:55.195 --> 00:06:00.123
Because human beings are at the epitome of evolution.

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:04.089
They have no ideas to how glorious they are,

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.148
how great they are.

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.500
I find in the West people are trying to find their identity,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.087
they curl their hair, or do all kinds of things.

00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:17.370
The identity lies within yourself.

00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:24.472
When you say, "These are my eyes, this is my nose, this is my body",

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:27.696
that means you are not this body, this mind.

00:06:27.896 --> 00:06:31.755
This is yours, but you are not the same.

00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:37.901
So you are not this body, this mind,

00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:42.824
these emotions, this ego, these conditionings,

00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:46.679
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:53.691
And that's what you have to become, every religion has said that,

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.671
every religion.

00:06:58.614 --> 00:07:00.915
Mohamed Sahib has said it, clearly,

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:04.811
that there have been so many wallis before.

00:07:05.011 --> 00:07:09.426
And there are going to be so many wallis also.

00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:12.748
You have to be a walli, He said it clearly.

00:07:12.948 --> 00:07:16.441
I met in Turkey, sufis.

00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:19.487
Of course, in India, we have very great sufis,

00:07:19.687 --> 00:07:25.246
Nizamuddin Sahib was there, and also we had

00:07:25.447 --> 00:07:28.029
Chishti, in Chishti we had another one.

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:30.256
Everywhere we had sufis like that,

00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:33.707
and they believed in Sahaja Yoga only.

00:07:37.018 --> 00:07:41.850
But they remained in different category.

00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:46.167
But in Turkey, thanks to Ataturk, I think,

00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:49.996
that these prospered very well.

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:54.306
And they came to Me, and they just surrendered to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:57.247
They wanted their Realization, they got their Realization.

00:07:57.447 --> 00:08:00.163
When their guru came, he also got his Realization,

00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:02.919
and he said, "This is Sahaja Yoga

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.655
which is going to transform the whole world".

00:08:05.855 --> 00:08:08.044
They, of course, they are in a way Muslims,

00:08:08.245 --> 00:08:10.345
because born in Muslim families,

00:08:10.546 --> 00:08:12.774
and that they sing the praise of Mohamed,

00:08:12.974 --> 00:08:16.660
of Ali, of Fatima, of everyone.

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:23.049
But they don't consider that, "We are the only chosen ones".

00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:26.679
Such beautiful people they were.

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.636
They got their Realization,

00:08:29.837 --> 00:08:34.631
"What it is? What about Christ?"

00:08:34.885 --> 00:08:38.197
He said, "Those who are not against Me, are with Me".

00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:43.418
Who are those, who are with Him?

00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:48.713
He was hardly given three years to express Himself.

00:08:48.913 --> 00:08:52.417
People were so blind at that time.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:09:00.207
It is, every religion has talked about the Spirit,

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:03.990
and the spirituality,

00:09:04.191 --> 00:09:07.802
but it has become now spiritism.

00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:11.578
These all kinds of black magic and things,

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.450
that has become the religion.

00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.468
Or it has become a power oriented thing.

00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:23.290
All kinds of nonsense you hear and you are really so sad.

00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:27.643
Like in Bosnia, so many Muslims are killed. For what?

00:09:27.844 --> 00:09:29.661
Because they are Muslims.

00:09:29.862 --> 00:09:34.500
In some places Christians are killed, because they are Christians.

00:09:36.447 --> 00:09:40.008
It's going on, everywhere,

00:09:40.237 --> 00:09:43.689
and now it's time for us to stop it.

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:46.479
We have no problem now with Russia,

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:49.649
and we'll never have a world war now, I hope so,

00:09:49.849 --> 00:09:53.273
but we have a problem of fundamentalism.

00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:56.344
And that comes from the ignorance

00:09:56.544 --> 00:10:01.995
that we are all part and parcel of one personality.

00:10:02.195 --> 00:10:05.344
And this ignorance has to go.

00:10:05.544 --> 00:10:12.072
And that can be done very easily once you become the Spirit.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.936
Now, it's not question of I'm telling you, as a sermon or a lecture.

00:10:17.136 --> 00:10:21.447
but it's a happening, it's an actualization

00:10:21.647 --> 00:10:24.777
of that experience, which is important.

00:10:26.859 --> 00:10:33.267
This experience is something,

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:38.381
which is extremely valuable today, for the whole world,

00:10:38.582 --> 00:10:41.994
because this is the time of Last Judgement.

00:10:42.217 --> 00:10:47.027
And this is the time when people are going to get

00:10:47.227 --> 00:10:49.809
their Self Realization.

00:10:50.099 --> 00:10:56.086
One has to understand, is a very important time now,

00:10:57.372 --> 00:10:59.524
Say, we say from chimpanzee

00:10:59.725 --> 00:11:03.036
we have come to human level, supposing even if we accept that,

00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:06.512
but there were two other races which came as human beings.

00:11:06.713 --> 00:11:09.246
They disappeared.

00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:14.047
In the same way there are people

00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:20.033
who are still seeking power, money, in the name of God.

00:11:21.072 --> 00:11:23.941
Can you imagine?

00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:30.730
Those who are seeking all such things,

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:36.532
should know that it is not reality.

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:41.382
Now when those people who see them,

00:11:41.582 --> 00:11:46.726
also they say, "No, there's no God", abhor that name,

00:11:46.927 --> 00:11:50.721
they are also wrong, because very unscientific.

00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:54.474
Have you found out, if there is God or not?

00:11:54.675 --> 00:11:58.882
By seeing a Hindu misbehaving, or a Muslim misbehaving,

00:11:59.082 --> 00:12:02.348
or a mula misbehaving and a pandit misbehaving,

00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:05.331
you cannot blame God for that.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.242
You cannot deny God.

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:10.537
If you are denying God, I would like to know in these modern times,

00:12:10.737 --> 00:12:15.046
what is the scientific proof that you are saying there is not God.

00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:20.190
Have you found out? Have you made any discoveries about it,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.941
that there is no God?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.405
So with a very open mind of a scientist,

00:12:29.107 --> 00:12:34.139
you have to understand that there is God,

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.531
which is a hypothesis before you,

00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:41.744
which you should not accept blindfolded.

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:45.442
but if it is proved,

00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:51.377
then as honest people you have to accept it.

00:12:51.577 --> 00:12:54.173
It's very important today,

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:57.233
that this world has to change

00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:02.014
to the emancipation and transformation of human beings.

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:06.244
All the problems of the world today, if you see, really,

00:13:06.445 --> 00:13:09.956
are from human beings.

00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:14.224
And all these human beings are having problems,

00:13:14.424 --> 00:13:18.213
because of their centers are in trouble.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.924
If somehow or other, we could cure these centers

00:13:24.464 --> 00:13:30.742
and connect our being to that All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:34.166
we enter into the kingdom of God,

00:13:34.367 --> 00:13:37.332
which is promised by every religion.

00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:42.103
Again I say, you see these beautiful flowers here,

00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:44.479
and we take them for granted.

00:13:44.687 --> 00:13:48.170
We never even think how they are here,

00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:52.567
on this earth, with a little seed.

00:13:52.767 --> 00:13:56.318
How does this Mother Earth gives this beautiful flowers?

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:57.949
It's such a miracle.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.947
It's a miracle like that, the photographs you are seeing.

00:14:01.148 --> 00:14:02.416
This is another miracle.

00:14:02.617 --> 00:14:05.891
But we take it for granted, all living processes.

00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:09.156
Everything we take it for granted.

00:14:09.356 --> 00:14:12.425
And we never try to judge

00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:16.911
whether it is a miracle,

00:14:17.112 --> 00:14:21.451
or how it has come. We never even think about it.

00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:25.360
Who does this living work?

00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:33.050
Supposing we extend our imagination, who does this living work?

00:14:33.368 --> 00:14:36.503
This living work, I say, is done

00:14:36.703 --> 00:14:42.083
by the All Pervading Divine Power of Love.

00:14:44.263 --> 00:14:46.063
This may be called as Ruh,

00:14:46.264 --> 00:14:50.434
could be called as Brahmachaitanya, Paramachaitanya.

00:14:50.635 --> 00:14:54.496
Patanjali has called it as Rithambhara Pragya.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.631
You may call it by any name

00:14:57.832 --> 00:15:00.756
but this power exists.

00:15:00.956 --> 00:15:06.492
Now, only thing is, you are to be connected to this power.

00:15:06.693 --> 00:15:08.939
Like this instrument is connected to the mains,

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:12.620
otherwise it has no identity, it has no meaning.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.790
Only thing you are to be connected to this All Pervading Power.

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:23.141
Once you are connected, you'll be surprised at yourself,

00:15:23.546 --> 00:15:27.735
how glorious you are, how great you are,

00:15:27.935 --> 00:15:34.696
what powers you have and what you can achieve.

00:15:35.315 --> 00:15:38.828
You suffer from stress and physical troubles,

00:15:39.029 --> 00:15:43.011
mental troubles, economic troubles, political troubles.

00:15:43.211 --> 00:15:46.739
All these troubles get solved.

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:52.276
Say there's complete darkness here, and there's commotion,

00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:55.763
you will in any way,

00:15:56.501 --> 00:15:59.383
stamp it onto other people.

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:04.079
You will, because there's darkness, trying to run,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.142
not knowing which is your aim, where to go, what to do.

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:10.711
That's what is world today.

00:16:10.918 --> 00:16:14.615
Is it to be pitied, that people are not

00:16:14.815 --> 00:16:17.881
genuinely seeking the truth?

00:16:18.334 --> 00:16:23.343
If they are, is their right to get their Self Realization,

00:16:23.544 --> 00:16:26.052
that is what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:32.428
So the truth is that you are the Spirit, pure Spirit,

00:16:32.628 --> 00:16:34.694
the second one is that

00:16:34.895 --> 00:16:38.871
there is this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:16:39.071 --> 00:16:43.229
which does all the living work. It runs our heart,

00:16:44.832 --> 00:16:48.982
it gives us children, it gives us beautiful nature,

00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:53.302
everything that is spontaneous, Sahaja,

00:16:53.503 --> 00:16:56.221
Saha is "born with you".

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.270
The right,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:05.104
to become united, yoga, with this All Pervading Power.

00:17:05.905 --> 00:17:08.924
But it is so simple,

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:11.658
that people don't understand.

00:17:11.858 --> 00:17:14.692
They think, "How can it be so simple?" It has to be.

00:17:14.892 --> 00:17:19.114
Because it is so vital, it is so important.

00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:22.208
Supposing if your breathing was difficult

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:27.108
and you had to read books for that, what would have happened?

00:17:27.308 --> 00:17:29.509
It is extremely vital.

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:32.353
But somehow human beings always think

00:17:32.554 --> 00:17:34.980
that you shouldn't eat your food like this but go round

00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:37.443
and eat like that.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.271
It is a very, very simple thing,

00:17:41.471 --> 00:17:45.867
Sahaj also means very simple, spontaneous.

00:17:46.082 --> 00:17:50.483
So the Kundalini is there, She is residing within you,

00:17:50.684 --> 00:17:54.720
She is your Mother, She knows everything about you,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.789
very anxious to give you, your Self Realization.

00:17:59.088 --> 00:18:03.205
It's like the primule in the seed, which has to sprout.

00:18:03.405 --> 00:18:07.168
Now, what you have to do is to put this seed in the Mother Earth,

00:18:07.368 --> 00:18:11.173
and the Mother Earth has the built-in quality to sprout it.

00:18:11.417 --> 00:18:15.222
and the seed has a built-in quality to get sprouted.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.347
It is, you can't explain.

00:18:19.547 --> 00:18:21.911
In one seed, do you mean to say

00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:25.995
there are maps of all the trees it is going to produce?

00:18:27.048 --> 00:18:31.825
Go to the microscopic thing, and it is vast.

00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:36.744
Go to the universe, it's vaste. The cosmos is vast.

00:18:36.944 --> 00:18:39.851
But a simple thing is that

00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:43.809
you are the epitome of all this creation,

00:18:45.345 --> 00:18:51.845
and you are the one who has that source

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:55.980
of knowledge, of joy,

00:18:57.883 --> 00:19:01.101
and absolute truth.

00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:05.429
This is what you are,

00:19:05.629 --> 00:19:10.699
and it's your own, so why not have it.

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:13.282
People sometimes, told Me that,

00:19:13.483 --> 00:19:17.166
"Mother, if you say that, you can get it free,

00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:19.430
then we can't believe it".

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.141
I said, "But why?"

00:19:21.341 --> 00:19:23.624
"Because supposing if it doesn't happen to us,

00:19:23.825 --> 00:19:26.265
we can go to the Courts."

00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:31.954
I said, this human mind doesn't understand,

00:19:32.154 --> 00:19:35.685
that it is something your own,

00:19:35.885 --> 00:19:41.336
your own evolutionary process and what have you paid for it?

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:48.567
Nothing. Do you mean to say God understands money and bank?

00:19:48.768 --> 00:19:55.192
No, no, it's all man made problems, complications.

00:19:55.866 --> 00:20:02.451
What is within you, is a beautiful Spirit,

00:20:02.652 --> 00:20:05.406
which is reflected in your heart.

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:10.154
And this, your Mother,

00:20:10.355 --> 00:20:13.595
who is your Kundalini.

00:20:13.796 --> 00:20:16.410
It has nothing to do with paganism and all that,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.431
you see, just to discard something as paganism.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.624
If Indians have to learn science from you,

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:28.677
why not learn the science of the roots from Indians?

00:20:29.128 --> 00:20:31.425
What's wrong?

00:20:34.603 --> 00:20:37.321
But people take to falsehood very easily,

00:20:37.522 --> 00:20:40.333
even in religion I have seen.

00:20:40.683 --> 00:20:43.257
You must first of all verify,

00:20:43.457 --> 00:20:46.532
the people who are talking about God and religion

00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:49.337
what is their personal character. Are they genuine?

00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:52.752
Secondly, what are their disciples like?

00:20:52.955 --> 00:20:55.935
Do they have any powers?

00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:00.665
Do they know anything?

00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:04.719
Unless and until you are verifying these things,

00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:07.509
you should not take to false people.

00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:10.110
And falsehood is so rambling,

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:15.204
is so evident, if you just use your logic,

00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:19.090
you'll find out, falsehood.

00:21:19.397 --> 00:21:23.036
What's the use of using false things?

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:27.432
If reality is within you, why not achieve it?

00:21:29.345 --> 00:21:34.566
This is such a beautiful thing that you are.

00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:37.603
You must accept yourself, you must honor yourself,

00:21:37.803 --> 00:21:40.400
respect yourself.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.076
Another western problem is a fashion to feel guilty,

00:21:45.872 --> 00:21:49.483
which I just don't understand, why do you feel guilty?

00:21:49.683 --> 00:21:53.591
After all you are human beings, you are not gods.

00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:58.042
If you make mistakes, what's the use of feeling guilty?

00:21:58.243 --> 00:22:00.634
If you have done mistakes, just face it.

00:22:00.834 --> 00:22:05.846
Face it up and finish with it, that you will not do it again.

00:22:06.064 --> 00:22:09.410
But no use feeling guilty all the time

00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:14.073
and spoiling your center here on the left hand side,

00:22:14.306 --> 00:22:18.968
which can give you not only spondylitis but also angina,

00:22:19.168 --> 00:22:22.336
and lethargic organs.

00:22:22.537 --> 00:22:27.505
The Sahaja Yoga today is on a scientific basis explained.

00:22:27.743 --> 00:22:30.089
We have doctors who have proved

00:22:30.336 --> 00:22:34.007
how Sahaja Yoga has cured cancers and things.

00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:37.953
And also we have scientists who have proved many things,

00:22:38.154 --> 00:22:40.217
which are said in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:40.417 --> 00:22:42.206
So it is tangible,

00:22:42.413 --> 00:22:45.007
it is not that something is said,

00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:49.110
which has no basis.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.522
And that is what one has to do,

00:22:52.722 --> 00:22:56.511
is to have an open mind of a scientist,

00:22:56.766 --> 00:23:01.259
take to Realization and see for yourself.

00:23:02.283 --> 00:23:07.997
If it working out, then you prove all these saints were correct.

00:23:12.904 --> 00:23:17.163
Like Guru Nanak has said "Sahaja Samadhi Lago".

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.963
So what is the meaning of "Sahaja Samadhi Lago"?

00:23:21.163 --> 00:23:24.977
Who understands that? What is Samadhi?

00:23:27.628 --> 00:23:31.108
All of them have talked about it.

00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:34.722
I do not want to mention all of them,

00:23:34.922 --> 00:23:39.207
but you can find out after Realization,

00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:44.768
that they were everywhere, telling about this,

00:23:44.969 --> 00:23:48.336
Of course they were not in a group

00:23:48.537 --> 00:23:55.110
but they were tortured, troubled, hanged, poisoned.

00:23:56.499 --> 00:24:00.354
Now, these are the days, are different.

00:24:00.555 --> 00:24:03.398
You can't hang a person for that.

00:24:04.517 --> 00:24:09.009
But also for our benevolence we have to accept it.

00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:13.251
We have to accept it because it's our own,

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.772
and we have to have it.

00:24:15.972 --> 00:24:19.578
It's a very, very simple thing

00:24:19.778 --> 00:24:23.542
which one has to understand

00:24:23.743 --> 00:24:28.684
that you cannot be only a human being.

00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:31.698
Must be something more to you.

00:24:32.846 --> 00:24:36.861
If only being a human being solves the problem,

00:24:37.061 --> 00:24:40.120
then there will be no problem at all.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.869
But there has to be something more.

00:24:43.069 --> 00:24:46.163
And that is not that you shave yourself off

00:24:46.364 --> 00:24:49.992
or you, you wear funny dresses, it's not that.

00:24:50.192 --> 00:24:52.119
By that you do not change.

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:54.537
But a inner transformation is needed

00:24:54.738 --> 00:24:57.762
and for that you have got the Kundalini.

00:24:57.962 --> 00:25:02.779
But it cannot be forced. First of all, you have to ask for it.

00:25:05.191 --> 00:25:07.810
If I am born in a Christian family, I'm a Christian,

00:25:08.011 --> 00:25:10.069
if you are born in Muslim family, you are Muslim,

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.536
you are born in a Hindu family, you are a Hindu.

00:25:12.736 --> 00:25:15.021
It's not a matter of choice.

00:25:16.984 --> 00:25:19.498
But what is needed is to understand

00:25:19.699 --> 00:25:24.742
that all human beings are born in some religion or other.

00:25:25.489 --> 00:25:30.401
But do you find that religion has gone inside them? No.

00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:34.515
You can find, whenever they get a chance

00:25:34.715 --> 00:25:36.343
they will do anything they feel like

00:25:36.544 --> 00:25:39.072
against what their religion has told them.

00:25:39.272 --> 00:25:42.743
So reason is they haven't got that power.

00:25:43.236 --> 00:25:45.193
of religion within themselves.

00:25:45.394 --> 00:25:48.720
Only after Sahaja Yoga you'll be amazed -

00:25:49.212 --> 00:25:51.078
I mean, I am myself amazed

00:25:51.278 --> 00:25:55.312
that people have given up drugs overnight,

00:25:55.513 --> 00:25:57.550
alcohols overnight.

00:25:57.751 --> 00:25:59.859
I don't have to tell. I don't tell anybody,

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.087
because if I tell "Don't drink", half of you will go away.

00:26:04.627 --> 00:26:06.578
So it's all right.

00:26:06.778 --> 00:26:10.401
You come along into the area,

00:26:10.762 --> 00:26:14.361
you can give Realization to others,

00:26:15.224 --> 00:26:18.552
you can diagnose the diseases of others,

00:26:18.752 --> 00:26:21.374
you can cure people.

00:26:21.797 --> 00:26:26.630
Apart from that you get all the knowledge which is so subtle,

00:26:27.209 --> 00:26:28.480
which is real.

00:26:28.681 --> 00:26:32.808
All other knowledge is called as avidya,

00:26:33.498 --> 00:26:37.060
is not knowledge, but is non-knowledge.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:41.672
The real knowledge is the knowledge of the Spirit,

00:26:42.053 --> 00:26:46.235
which cannot be challenged, it cannot be changed,

00:26:46.482 --> 00:26:51.331
it is, it has been and it will be.

00:26:51.989 --> 00:26:54.389
All these things people have said,

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.506
only the difference is today,

00:26:56.706 --> 00:27:00.031
you have to get the actual experience of that.

00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:02.905
That's the only difference.

00:27:03.691 --> 00:27:06.913
And also that is en-masse.

00:27:07.285 --> 00:27:10.458
Thousands of people can get Self Realization.

00:27:10.658 --> 00:27:13.414
It's the blessings of these modern times,

00:27:13.615 --> 00:27:17.878
which are called as Ghor Kali Yuga, the worst times.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:21.031
This is the time only this was to happen,

00:27:21.238 --> 00:27:24.150
and it's happening all over the world.

00:27:24.358 --> 00:27:27.189
I don't think I can explain to you

00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:31.070
about Sahaja Yoga in this short time.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.300
After all I don't know how many lectures

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.576
I must have given in English language itself,

00:27:37.777 --> 00:27:40.151
and so many other languages.

00:27:40.477 --> 00:27:44.071
But what is the use of talking about it?

00:27:44.454 --> 00:27:48.040
As I always said that there are so many beautiful lights here.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.694
For that, you have to just put the switch on,

00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:52.837
because it's all built-in.

00:27:53.037 --> 00:27:55.336
But supposing I start telling you all the story

00:27:55.537 --> 00:27:59.151
about how electricity was found and how it was brought to London,

00:27:59.352 --> 00:28:05.758
and then to this Royal Albert Hall, you'll be all absolutely bored.

00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:09.218
Best thing is to have your lights on.

00:28:09.419 --> 00:28:12.307
As you have seen today, all the Sahaja Yogis were sitting,

00:28:12.507 --> 00:28:15.251
and on top of their head there was light.

00:28:15.452 --> 00:28:17.807
Also there are many other photographs they have not shown

00:28:18.016 --> 00:28:22.180
of the children, Sahaja Yogi children are born to Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.999
They are born realized,

00:28:24.199 --> 00:28:27.977
and they have a glow around their head, you can see.

00:28:28.626 --> 00:28:33.301
All this is happening maybe to prove you people something.

00:28:33.704 --> 00:28:36.893
But cameras are wonderful thing I have seen,

00:28:37.093 --> 00:28:42.069
that those people used to mesmerize and play some tricks

00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:45.306
were found out by the cameras.

00:28:45.506 --> 00:28:48.482
And with Me they play these tricks.

00:28:48.704 --> 00:28:53.282
So these modern times are something special I must say,

00:28:53.482 --> 00:28:55.525
that cameras are discovered

00:28:55.726 --> 00:29:00.879
and they can really somehow or other

00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:05.952
make the picture of these vibrations.

00:29:08.682 --> 00:29:12.211
It is hard for people

00:29:12.411 --> 00:29:14.878
to give up their conditionings,

00:29:15.078 --> 00:29:18.027
because they think now, we are born into this thing, born into...

00:29:18.228 --> 00:29:22.689
No, you are born, but you are not that.

00:29:24.598 --> 00:29:29.987
To be that, in whatever religion you are born,

00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:33.383
you have to be a realized soul.

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:38.258
To be a real Englishman one you have to be a realized soul,

00:29:38.459 --> 00:29:40.700
otherwise you cannot be.

00:29:40.901 --> 00:29:45.591
To be a real Indian, you have to be a realized soul.

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:51.121
Because you don't know the glory of your country.

00:29:51.321 --> 00:29:54.416
You don't know what your country is. Like they said

00:29:54.617 --> 00:29:58.202
that I have told them that is the heart. Now the proof is there.

00:29:58.488 --> 00:30:00.968
Heart of the universe is England.

00:30:01.168 --> 00:30:03.644
That's why everything circulates, you see.

00:30:03.845 --> 00:30:06.344
Anything goes wrong here,

00:30:06.544 --> 00:30:10.913
circulates all over. Of course we have now yellow journalism,

00:30:11.114 --> 00:30:13.356
and the media and all that nonsense is going on.

00:30:13.556 --> 00:30:16.413
But even that circulates.

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:20.380
So you are placed in a very important place,

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.261
is the heart of the universe.

00:30:22.461 --> 00:30:26.128
And see the proof is shown by the cameras.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.018
This is the small portion they have taken out otherwise

00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:33.051
there are hearts, hearts, hearts everywhere.

00:30:34.512 --> 00:30:40.053
So just to feel that you are here in England,

00:30:40.253 --> 00:30:44.895
you have to also feel that you have not yet felt,

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:48.744
the reality of England.

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:50.959
And the reality can only be felt

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.235
when you are in the realm of reality.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.927
And this realm of reality lies within yourself,

00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:03.877
which is very easy to achieve.

00:31:04.758 --> 00:31:09.756
So the power that achieves it is that of Kundalini,

00:31:09.956 --> 00:31:13.892
and it's the pure desire.

00:31:14.749 --> 00:31:18.557
If you have the pure desire, it will work out.

00:31:18.757 --> 00:31:21.509
But if you are arrogant,

00:31:21.709 --> 00:31:24.533
if you are here to criticize,

00:31:24.733 --> 00:31:28.697
or to make some sort of a commentary,

00:31:28.898 --> 00:31:30.780
Kundalini won't rise.

00:31:31.003 --> 00:31:36.328
You have to have pure desire to become the Spirit, that's all.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:40.327
Depends only on one point

00:31:40.527 --> 00:31:43.643
that you have to have pure desire.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.023
You don't have to pay anything, you don't have to think anything,

00:31:48.223 --> 00:31:51.913
you don't have to do any mantras, nothing,

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.678
but just the pure desire to be that.

00:31:56.878 --> 00:32:00.575
Because as you know, in economics, in general,

00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:03.369
wants are not satiable.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:09.040
But once you achieve the state of Spirit,

00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:12.407
then you become the giver.

00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:17.962
The only want you have, that how many people I can give Realization,

00:32:20.101 --> 00:32:24.330
how many people can be saved.

00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:28.291
And without any ego about it.

00:32:28.942 --> 00:32:31.278
You will see that after Realization,

00:32:31.478 --> 00:32:34.471
you will start talking in the third person.

00:32:34.672 --> 00:32:38.479
It's a beautiful state within yourself, which is dormant,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.987
which you have to achieve.

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.924
There's another point I have to tell you,

00:32:45.124 --> 00:32:48.767
that today Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:51.782
It is not that in your house, you sit down and do Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:51.982 --> 00:32:53.483
you cannot do it.

00:32:53.684 --> 00:32:56.562
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

00:32:56.763 --> 00:33:00.611
Like, if my nail is cut out, it doesn't grow.

00:33:00.811 --> 00:33:03.310
So you have to come to the collective.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.223
You don't have to pay for anything, nothing,

00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:09.223
but you have to come to our collectives.

00:33:09.423 --> 00:33:13.386
As we do not take money,

00:33:13.586 --> 00:33:20.565
for maintaining big temples, or big places,

00:33:21.057 --> 00:33:24.843
you must understand that wherever

00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:30.637
people are feeling this All Pervading Power,

00:33:30.838 --> 00:33:33.573
is the best place to go to.

00:33:34.329 --> 00:33:36.994
And you shouldn't think about

00:33:37.194 --> 00:33:42.162
what was the hall like, or where they were doing all these,

00:33:42.393 --> 00:33:44.351
or what sort of people were there,

00:33:44.551 --> 00:33:47.955
because the door of Sahaja Yoga is open to everyone.

00:33:48.155 --> 00:33:51.280
Sometimes we really get lunatics walking in.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.780
Doesn't matter. But some of them do get cleared out.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.368
Some of them do get cured.

00:34:00.095 --> 00:34:04.269
We don't criticize anyone. Let everyone come.

00:34:04.952 --> 00:34:07.867
And I'm amazed that so far

00:34:08.068 --> 00:34:10.720
those who have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.371
have all achieved their selfhood.

00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:16.815
And I wish you all good luck.

00:34:17.015 --> 00:34:19.458
We'll do a little meditation just now

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:23.348
and I'm sure all of you are going to get your Self Realization,

00:34:23.642 --> 00:34:26.134
no doubt of it.

00:34:27.864 --> 00:34:31.052
I know there are questions in your heads, quite a lot,

00:34:31.252 --> 00:34:32.957
doesn't matter.

00:34:33.158 --> 00:34:36.618
You can write them down and send it over, we'll answer them.

00:34:36.903 --> 00:34:40.687
But this question and all, that you I become an expert now,

00:34:40.887 --> 00:34:44.639
dealing with this kind of thing for the last 21 years.

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:47.925
So I can answer all of that, no doubt.

00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:51.473
But it's just a mental acrobat.

00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:56.355
You have to ask for the experience of your being.

00:34:56.625 --> 00:35:01.584
What's the use of discussion, argument and conferences?

00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:04.791
What have you achieved out of that?

00:35:05.411 --> 00:35:11.307
So just to ask for your Self Realization, it's very important.

00:35:12.635 --> 00:35:16.729
Now, those who do not want, I cannot force on them.

00:35:17.254 --> 00:35:20.132
Your freedom as a human being, is worshipped,

00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:24.682
is not only accepted but it's also worshipped.

00:35:24.936 --> 00:35:27.442
If you want to go to hell, you can go.

00:35:27.642 --> 00:35:30.919
If you want to go to heaven, you can go to heaven as well.

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:34.038
So, cannot be forced.

00:35:34.238 --> 00:35:37.427
As I said, it's the pure desire,

00:35:37.627 --> 00:35:41.205
is the one that is going to work it out.

00:35:42.047 --> 00:35:44.947
All those who do not want to have it, should leave the hall,

00:35:45.147 --> 00:35:46.610
could be better,

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:50.720
and not to sit down here, watching others and criticizing.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.829
That would be a much better idea,

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:57.412
to leave others to have the experience.

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:01.201
It is a

00:36:03.689 --> 00:36:07.607
chance that My husband got elected to a job here,

00:36:07.808 --> 00:36:10.598
and I came to England.

00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:17.383
And it has been really a great experience because

00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:22.622
I found that this is a place where,

00:36:22.823 --> 00:36:25.679
if Sahaja Yoga is established,

00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:30.424
it will work out everywhere very well. And it did.

00:36:30.625 --> 00:36:34.235
But amazingly it has worked more in Russia,

00:36:34.435 --> 00:36:37.330
more in the Eastern block.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.220
Because they had no religion, imagine.

00:36:42.086 --> 00:36:45.038
They were clean slates.

00:36:45.268 --> 00:36:47.608
No bindings.

00:36:47.808 --> 00:36:52.322
And you won't believe that in Russia we always have it

00:36:52.522 --> 00:36:56.259
in big stadiums, sixteen thousands to eighteen thousands people.

00:36:56.459 --> 00:36:58.370
And people are sitting on the ground.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.496
And all of them get Realization.

00:37:01.697 --> 00:37:05.069
And Eastern block, all of them.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:10.149
So this too much of freedom, has made us mad also.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.354
That's why our attention is not so good.

00:37:14.554 --> 00:37:17.568
But despite that it has worked.

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:20.112
I could not have worked in communist countries,

00:37:20.312 --> 00:37:22.456
only in democratic countries I could work.

00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:25.997
But as now, in Russia and all these places,

00:37:26.197 --> 00:37:30.567
we have got a regime so called,

00:37:30.768 --> 00:37:33.025
which says they want to be democratic.

00:37:33.225 --> 00:37:35.755
We had a chance to get in.

00:37:35.955 --> 00:37:38.557
And they wouldn't accept any false person.

00:37:38.757 --> 00:37:41.139
All of them were thrown out.

00:37:41.283 --> 00:37:44.242
I don't know how they knew.

00:37:45.371 --> 00:37:48.029
Only I know about the writers, Russian writers,

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.598
that they are very introspective, very introspective.

00:37:51.799 --> 00:37:54.297
And they put even the hero into introspection,

00:37:54.497 --> 00:37:58.394
and the heroine into introspection.

00:37:58.903 --> 00:38:02.624
While in democracy we do not introspect.

00:38:03.022 --> 00:38:04.764
That may be one of the reasons

00:38:04.965 --> 00:38:07.793
that they are extremely introspective.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:14.005
So, it is for you to accept or not to accept.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.163
As I said, it cannot be forced.

00:38:17.363 --> 00:38:20.773
But the whole thing works out beautifully.

00:38:23.649 --> 00:38:27.458
There are few things which I'll tell you how to do it,

00:38:27.696 --> 00:38:31.811
and I'm sure it will work out very well tonight.

00:38:32.446 --> 00:38:36.183
So again I would request, those who don't want please go away.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.929
It's better for us, it would be very kind.

00:38:48.788 --> 00:38:53.004
First of all, I would request you to take out your shoes,

00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:54.710
because this Mother Earth,

00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:58.557
as I said you are sitting in the heart of the universe.

00:38:59.152 --> 00:39:02.325
So if you could take out your shoes,

00:39:02.453 --> 00:39:04.770
will be a better idea.

00:39:11.996 --> 00:39:13.942
You can't imagine sitting in your chairs

00:39:14.142 --> 00:39:16.030
you can get your Realization,

00:39:16.231 --> 00:39:20.042
you don't have to go to Himalayas or anything, nothing of the kind.

00:39:23.447 --> 00:39:25.764
All right.

00:39:34.465 --> 00:39:37.506
Can you get somebody to show?

00:39:37.759 --> 00:39:41.060
Doctor, can you come here?

00:39:47.861 --> 00:39:52.487
That's dr. Spiro from England.

00:39:55.408 --> 00:39:59.932
Now, first I will show you,

00:40:01.846 --> 00:40:07.899
how you yourself will have to enrich your own centers.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.423
It's very simple.

00:40:13.392 --> 00:40:16.192
Because you have to know,

00:40:16.392 --> 00:40:20.002
that the centers if they are in trouble,

00:40:20.202 --> 00:40:24.328
then the Kundalini takes time to rise.

00:40:26.545 --> 00:40:31.013
So there are two things I would say, which are important,

00:40:31.577 --> 00:40:33.702
or can be conditions.

00:40:33.902 --> 00:40:38.219
Firstly, as I told you, you don't have to feel guilty.

00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:41.321
If you feel guilty,

00:40:41.521 --> 00:40:44.980
this center catches, on the left side.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.250
And it is catching, today.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.377
It's a common fashion, you know,

00:40:50.577 --> 00:40:53.993
it's like as they say, "it is in to feel guilty",

00:40:54.271 --> 00:40:58.493
to e miserable, to show that you are very miserable.

00:41:00.516 --> 00:41:03.637
If somebody looks very happy, people don't understand.

00:41:03.838 --> 00:41:07.474
Like I went to France. First they said, "Mother,

00:41:07.675 --> 00:41:10.728
You look very happy, they won't like You". I said, "Really?".

00:41:10.929 --> 00:41:14.032
"No, they are very miserable."

00:41:14.255 --> 00:41:16.738
I said, "For what?", "They are.

00:41:16.938 --> 00:41:20.836
They are worried about this world will be destroyed very soon."

00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:26.096
All right? So I started My lecture with "Les Miserable".

00:41:27.652 --> 00:41:31.953
So we need not have that kind of an attitude towards ourselves.

00:41:33.956 --> 00:41:36.782
First of all, you are not to feel guilty at all.

00:41:36.982 --> 00:41:40.174
I request you again and again not to feel guilty.

00:41:40.374 --> 00:41:43.476
There's nothing to be confessed,

00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:49.283
nothing to feel bad about. Past is past and finished.

00:41:49.483 --> 00:41:51.791
It doesn't exist anymore.

00:41:51.991 --> 00:41:55.901
Future also doesn't exist. In the present if you have to be,

00:41:56.102 --> 00:41:59.998
then forget the past, for the time being.

00:42:01.924 --> 00:42:08.130
Secondly, you have to forgive everyone, it's very important.

00:42:08.441 --> 00:42:12.591
Many people have told Me, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive".

00:42:13.327 --> 00:42:14.867
I said, "Why?"

00:42:15.067 --> 00:42:18.622
 Logically if you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:42:18.823 --> 00:42:21.083
What do you do?

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:26.793
Nothing. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:32.198
So, during the course of this raising of Kundalini

00:42:32.398 --> 00:42:34.545
I'll request you to forgive everyone,

00:42:34.746 --> 00:42:36.773
and before that if you forgive, is well and good,

00:42:36.974 --> 00:42:39.414
because then, this center catches.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.942
Between the optic chiasma is this center, is closed like this,

00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:47.698
the most constricted center we have, in the modern times.

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:52.040
But if you forgive, it opens out, and the Kundalini can rise.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.262
As it is, you have suffered so much,

00:42:55.462 --> 00:42:58.144
playing into the hands of wrong people,

00:42:58.345 --> 00:43:03.431
and again today you may miss the point,

00:43:03.631 --> 00:43:07.080
may not get your Self Realization, if you don't forgive.

00:43:07.351 --> 00:43:10.486
Don't think about them, it's a headache.

00:43:10.686 --> 00:43:14.860
Just say, "I forgive everyone of them".

00:43:17.759 --> 00:43:20.224
"Everyone of them I forgive".

00:43:20.425 --> 00:43:24.305
Or you can say, "I forgive all of them". It's the best.

00:43:24.734 --> 00:43:28.146
You'll feel much lighter even now.

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:36.430
Now, we'll show you, what is to be done.

00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:38.483
Just now, don't close your eyes.

00:43:38.684 --> 00:43:44.147
Put your left hand like this towards Me on your lap, comfortably.

00:43:44.348 --> 00:43:46.428
You have to be comfortable.

00:43:46.629 --> 00:43:50.031
If there's anything tide here or tide on your waist or anywhere

00:43:50.232 --> 00:43:52.375
please loosen it, but you have to be comfortable.

00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:56.242
Now, put your left hand like this. This is just symbolic

00:43:56.442 --> 00:44:00.965
or the expression that you want to have your Self Realization.

00:44:01.275 --> 00:44:05.535
Left side is the power of desire.

00:44:05.735 --> 00:44:08.359
the right side is the power of action.

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:10.546
All these things you will know.

00:44:10.746 --> 00:44:13.669
It doesn't take much time to know all these things.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.901
So now, you put your right hand

00:44:17.068 --> 00:44:19.272
on your heart first,

00:44:19.473 --> 00:44:23.237
because in the heart is reflected

00:44:23.412 --> 00:44:26.324
the God Almighty as Spirit.

00:44:30.403 --> 00:44:33.189
And then,

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.723
you have to put your hand on the left hand side

00:44:38.462 --> 00:44:43.691
of your abdomen, in the upper part, because the left side

00:44:45.104 --> 00:44:48.896
will be working with our pure desire,

00:44:50.464 --> 00:44:52.574
working on the left side.

00:44:52.775 --> 00:44:56.105
Now, if you are the Spirit, you become your own master.

00:44:56.305 --> 00:45:00.432
You become your guide, you are your own guru.

00:45:01.483 --> 00:45:06.299
So this is the center, where you become yourself, your guru,

00:45:06.499 --> 00:45:11.253
which is created by all the prophets and seers and saints, for us.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:13.211
We have to just awaken it.

00:45:13.412 --> 00:45:15.641
Once it is awaken I don't have to tell you

00:45:15.842 --> 00:45:20.784
what is your religion. You just follow it. You do it yourself.

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:27.551
Then below that, it's the center here,

00:45:28.614 --> 00:45:31.598
is the center of pure knowledge.

00:45:31.799 --> 00:45:34.864
which is quite surprising for people how can it be there.

00:45:35.087 --> 00:45:37.915
But it is there. And how it is there

00:45:38.116 --> 00:45:41.004
and how it gets transformed to the brain and all that,

00:45:41.204 --> 00:45:44.465
you will know later on, how it works out.

00:45:44.666 --> 00:45:47.129
So it is in the lower portion of your abdomen,

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.979
on the left hand side,

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:55.751
is the pure knowledge, as you call it, shuddha vidya.

00:45:56.318 --> 00:45:57.755
Then you raise your right hand

00:45:57.956 --> 00:46:01.462
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:46:02.474 --> 00:46:05.351
Then on your heart again.

00:46:06.164 --> 00:46:09.273
Then, in the corner of your neck and shoulder,

00:46:09.473 --> 00:46:13.552
where I told you this left Vishuddhi is catching,

00:46:14.077 --> 00:46:17.958
and turn your head to your right.

00:46:21.889 --> 00:46:26.389
Then please take your right hand, on your forehead across,

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.516
and put down your head as far as possible.

00:46:32.762 --> 00:46:36.444
Here you have to forgive everyone.

00:46:38.003 --> 00:46:40.820
And don't feel guilty.

00:46:41.264 --> 00:46:44.410
So best thing would be then to put your left hand,

00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:48.991
right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head.

00:46:50.459 --> 00:46:52.887
Here,

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:59.665
just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

00:46:59.866 --> 00:47:02.242
from the Divine Power

00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:06.046
If you have done any mistakes, let the Divine Power forgive you.

00:47:06.247 --> 00:47:08.713
because this is for your satisfaction, again I say so.

00:47:08.914 --> 00:47:12.489
I don't want you to feel guilty about it and count your mistakes.

00:47:12.689 --> 00:47:15.839
Now, then stretch your palm fully.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.378
In the center of the palm is very important

00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:23.044
because you have to put the center of your palm

00:47:23.283 --> 00:47:26.388
on top of the fontanelle bone area,

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:28.931
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:47:29.131 --> 00:47:34.705
As we call it in Indian language is talu, which was a soft bone.

00:47:34.905 --> 00:47:37.785
Put it nicely. Now here,

00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:40.833
you have to push back your fingers. This is very important.

00:47:41.064 --> 00:47:44.261
And your thumb so that there's a proper pressure.

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:47.791
Now put down your head as far as possible.

00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:54.478
And this now, turn your hand,

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.343
clockwise, very slowly at this point.

00:47:59.544 --> 00:48:04.027
Please put down your head, first of all, put down your hear. Now...

00:48:05.685 --> 00:48:08.562
Now, push back your fingers, push back, otherwise you cannot.

00:48:08.763 --> 00:48:11.714
Now seven times you have to move.

00:48:11.915 --> 00:48:16.082
Push it, don't move your hand as the scalp.

00:48:16.258 --> 00:48:19.051
Move your scalp.

00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:22.768
Good. Seven times.

00:48:22.951 --> 00:48:24.829
That's all we have to do.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:29.543
You will know, that today, tonight only you have to do this.

00:48:29.744 --> 00:48:31.292
You don't have to do it later on,

00:48:31.493 --> 00:48:33.128
you don't have to remember anything.

00:48:33.339 --> 00:48:37.077
Is once you are a realized soul, you are very different.

00:48:37.278 --> 00:48:40.829
Like, when you have to climb the steps, you see, you have to climb.

00:48:41.029 --> 00:48:44.385
But once you are up there, you don't climb any, that's all.

00:48:44.586 --> 00:48:47.140
Once you reach that state you don't have to do.

00:48:47.363 --> 00:48:49.849
But in any way if you go to the centers

00:48:50.049 --> 00:48:52.420
they'll explain to you everything

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.197
they'll tell you everything

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:57.112
and nobody is going to charge any money.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:59.720
Maybe they might charge some nominal

00:48:59.921 --> 00:49:02.748
for the maintenance of a certain place, maybe.

00:49:02.949 --> 00:49:05.646
But so far, as I know, that mostly it is done

00:49:05.846 --> 00:49:08.832
by the people who are already Sahaja Yogis

00:49:09.033 --> 00:49:11.621
or by the center itself.

00:49:11.822 --> 00:49:15.175
Because after all we have to pay for this hall.

00:49:15.409 --> 00:49:18.570
And they have organized that money.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.722
Last time I payed. This time, I think,

00:49:20.923 --> 00:49:24.055
I don't know how they managed to make that arrangement.

00:49:24.256 --> 00:49:26.713
And they repaid Me also.

00:49:26.913 --> 00:49:29.040
So this is the Sahaja Yogis

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.632
who feel that they have to do something for you.

00:49:31.833 --> 00:49:35.765
They do it themselves and organize it.

00:49:37.088 --> 00:49:40.320
But you will not be put to any pressure or anything,

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:45.682
and you are not responsible for paying anything, at all.

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:51.464
Now, so now, we'll have to close our eyes.

00:49:51.665 --> 00:49:53.834
We better take out our spectacles,

00:49:54.035 --> 00:49:56.510
because you are not to open your eyes till I tell you.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.851
Just take out your spectacles. Also good for the eyesight.

00:50:05.306 --> 00:50:09.471
Now, you don't have to say any mantras, any prayer, nothing.

00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:12.801
And you don't have to force your attention to anything.

00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:16.408
Automatically will happen. You just leave it alone,

00:50:16.608 --> 00:50:18.768
your attention, your thoughts.

00:50:18.968 --> 00:50:21.698
Don't worry if there are thoughts, doesn't matter.

00:50:21.898 --> 00:50:25.814
Everything will be cleared out by the Kundalini.

00:50:26.842 --> 00:50:31.500
All right. Now, please put your right hand on your heart,

00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:35.456
both the feet away from each other,

00:50:36.243 --> 00:50:40.035
left hand on your lap comfortably.

00:50:40.235 --> 00:50:43.229
And now close your eyes.

00:50:43.429 --> 00:50:46.091
On this center of the heart

00:50:46.292 --> 00:50:50.224
you have to ask a very fundamental question in your heart.

00:50:50.445 --> 00:50:54.183
It's like a computer working out you can say.

00:50:54.509 --> 00:50:57.320
You have to ask a question in your heart.

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.603
You can call Me, Shri Mataji, or you can call Me, Mother,

00:51:00.803 --> 00:51:03.346
whatever you like.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.345
Ask a question three times in your heart, "Mother

00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:12.727
am I the Spirit?". Ask this question in your heart.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:29.172
As I told you, if you become the Spirit, you become your own master.

00:51:30.776 --> 00:51:33.307
So now please take your hand,

00:51:33.507 --> 00:51:38.489
on the left hand side of your abdomen, on the upper abdomen.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.258
Here, press it hard and here you ask

00:51:42.458 --> 00:51:46.107
another important question three times, "Mother,

00:51:46.307 --> 00:51:51.616
am I my own master?" Ask this question three times.

00:51:56.902 --> 00:52:00.188
As I have told you I cannot force

00:52:00.389 --> 00:52:03.230
your Realization on you. In the same way,

00:52:03.326 --> 00:52:07.317
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

00:52:07.518 --> 00:52:09.242
You have to ask for it.

00:52:09.442 --> 00:52:11.161
So now, please take your hand,

00:52:11.362 --> 00:52:14.564
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:19.867
Here is a center, which has got six petals.

00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:25.488
So, six times, you have to ask,

00:52:26.004 --> 00:52:30.702
"Mother please give me pure knowledge".

00:52:41.547 --> 00:52:45.428
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

00:52:45.881 --> 00:52:48.316
Kundalini starts rising.

00:52:48.516 --> 00:52:51.205
So we have to clear out the upper centers,

00:52:51.405 --> 00:52:54.936
with our full self confidence.

00:52:55.175 --> 00:52:57.029
Please know that you are

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.613
at the epitome of evolution, as human beings,

00:53:00.814 --> 00:53:03.791
and have full confidence in yourself.

00:53:03.992 --> 00:53:07.682
In no way degrade yourself

00:53:08.119 --> 00:53:11.236
and feel inferior to anyone.

00:53:11.437 --> 00:53:15.110
So now raise your right hand, in the upper portion of your abdomen,

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:18.603
on the left hand side and press it hard.

00:53:25.176 --> 00:53:29.494
Here you have to say with self confidence ten times,

00:53:31.273 --> 00:53:35.463
"Mother I am my own master".

00:53:35.664 --> 00:53:38.256
Please say it ten times.

00:53:44.979 --> 00:53:49.431
I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind,

00:53:49.749 --> 00:53:53.009
this intellect, these emotions,

00:53:53.209 --> 00:53:55.460
this ego, these conditionings,

00:53:55.662 --> 00:53:59.177
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:54:00.199 --> 00:54:03.254
So now raise your right hand on your heart,

00:54:03.469 --> 00:54:05.627
and here you have to say,

00:54:05.708 --> 00:54:08.371
with full confidence twelve times,

00:54:08.572 --> 00:54:11.688
"Mother I am the pure Spirit".

00:54:11.889 --> 00:54:13.903
Please say it twelve times.

00:54:14.103 --> 00:54:16.784
You have to accept your position first of all.

00:54:16.984 --> 00:54:21.490
You see, before taking the throne, the king has to say

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:25.817
that "I accept the throne". In the same way.

00:54:27.678 --> 00:54:29.884
Please say it twelve times,

00:54:30.085 --> 00:54:34.245
"Mother I am the pure Spirit".

00:54:40.979 --> 00:54:42.970
You have to know that

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:47.416
this All Pervading Power of Divine Love

00:54:48.131 --> 00:54:55.386
is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss.

00:54:55.587 --> 00:55:00.811
It is the ocean of absolute knowledge.

00:55:01.011 --> 00:55:04.757
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:09.102
And whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved

00:55:09.303 --> 00:55:12.912
into this great ocean of forgiveness.

00:55:13.112 --> 00:55:17.127
So please forgive yourself. You have no business

00:55:17.755 --> 00:55:21.174
to in any way, condemn yourself.

00:55:21.374 --> 00:55:24.151
So now, raise your right hand

00:55:24.351 --> 00:55:27.373
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

00:55:27.573 --> 00:55:31.890
and turn your head to your right.

00:55:32.478 --> 00:55:37.787
Here, you have to say sixteen times,

00:55:38.398 --> 00:55:40.319
with full confidence again,

00:55:40.478 --> 00:55:45.104
"Mother I am not guilty at all".

00:55:50.102 --> 00:55:53.718
I find this is the worst center today catching,

00:55:53.806 --> 00:55:56.345
here, in England.

00:55:58.122 --> 00:56:02.653
Say it emphatically, "I am not guilty at all".

00:56:15.385 --> 00:56:19.009
Again, I have told you that

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:22.916
whether you forgive or don't forgive

00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:27.629
you are not doing anything, logically.

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:32.535
But if you don't forgive you play into wrong hands.

00:56:32.814 --> 00:56:37.881
And as it is you have suffered because of that,

00:56:38.082 --> 00:56:41.502
while the person who has troubled you is quite happy.

00:56:41.702 --> 00:56:46.972
So now, at this point, you have to forgive

00:56:47.359 --> 00:56:49.755
all of them,

00:56:49.955 --> 00:56:53.151
not thinking about them, in general.

00:56:53.351 --> 00:56:56.555
So now raise your hand, to your forehead across

00:56:56.756 --> 00:57:00.904
and put down your head, as far as possible.

00:57:03.818 --> 00:57:08.071
Here, you have to say, from your heart, not how many times,

00:57:08.271 --> 00:57:12.969
from your heart, "Mother I forgive

00:57:13.723 --> 00:57:17.349
everyone in general",

00:57:35.397 --> 00:57:38.563
Now, for your own satisfaction.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:46.114
Please don't count your mistakes and don't feel guilty,

00:57:46.315 --> 00:57:49.475
but for your own satisfaction,

00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:52.959
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

00:57:53.159 --> 00:57:55.562
So now take back your right hand,

00:57:55.762 --> 00:57:57.215
on the backside of your head,

00:57:57.416 --> 00:58:01.073
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:58:03.635 --> 00:58:08.549
Here, you have to say,

00:58:10.111 --> 00:58:13.904
"Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me,

00:58:14.104 --> 00:58:18.817
if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly".

00:58:19.342 --> 00:58:24.103
This also you have to say from your heart, not how many times.

00:58:35.573 --> 00:58:40.009
Now, the last center is the most important one.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:44.746
For that you have to stretch your palm

00:58:44.946 --> 00:58:47.865
and put the center of your palm,

00:58:48.056 --> 00:58:50.313
on top of the fontanel bone area,

00:58:50.514 --> 00:58:54.120
which was a soft bone on your childhood.

00:58:56.507 --> 00:59:00.141
And now put down your head.

00:59:00.348 --> 00:59:04.125
Press it hard. Push back your fingers.

00:59:10.508 --> 00:59:12.813
Now, put down your head please, push back your fingers,

00:59:13.014 --> 00:59:15.667
it's very important.

00:59:18.668 --> 00:59:20.477
Again, I am sorry,

00:59:20.677 --> 00:59:24.277
I cannot force Self Realization on you. You have to ask for it.

00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:28.873
So now please move, move your hand,

00:59:29.073 --> 00:59:32.786
or I would say, move your scalp, slowly,

00:59:32.986 --> 00:59:37.357
seven times, clockwise, saying seven times,

00:59:37.557 --> 00:59:41.453
"Mother please give me my Self Realization".

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:46.790
You have to ask for it. None can force it on you.

00:59:48.462 --> 00:59:51.835
Seven times.

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:38.321
Now, please, take down your hands.

01:00:39.393 --> 01:00:42.169
Now, put both the hands towards Me like this,

01:00:42.369 --> 01:00:44.801
and watch Me without thinking.

01:00:45.002 --> 01:00:48.115
Watch Me without thinking.

01:00:54.539 --> 01:00:57.666
Now, please put the right hand like this,

01:00:57.867 --> 01:01:00.986
and bend your head, and with the left hand

01:01:01.186 --> 01:01:05.612
see if there's a cool breeze, coming out of your head,

01:01:05.813 --> 01:01:08.865
out of your fontanel bone area. Bend your head and see for yourself.

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:12.701
Some people get it hot, some will get it cold.

01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:17.112
Some will get it close to the head, and some far away.

01:01:17.313 --> 01:01:20.774
But don't put it on top of the head, but away from it,

01:01:20.975 --> 01:01:23.512
and see for yourself, moving your left hand,

01:01:23.712 --> 01:01:26.365
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming

01:01:26.566 --> 01:01:29.693
out of your fontanel bone area.

01:01:31.395 --> 01:01:33.705
Bend your heads please.

01:01:33.906 --> 01:01:37.467
Now, please take left hand and bend your head,

01:01:37.658 --> 01:01:40.045
and see for yourself,

01:01:40.246 --> 01:01:43.237
if there's a cool,

01:01:46.277 --> 01:01:49.047
or a hot air,

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.331
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:01:53.531 --> 01:01:55.556
Some people can get it very far, you know,

01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:58.707
some people get it closer.

01:02:00.682 --> 01:02:02.171
Now, again, with your right hand.

01:02:02.372 --> 01:02:04.444
Please put your right hand towards Me.

01:02:04.658 --> 01:02:08.516
Now, again, bend your head and see for yourself.

01:02:21.769 --> 01:02:26.682
Little far away, some people get it. Now,

01:02:27.261 --> 01:02:30.967
raise your both the hands

01:02:31.211 --> 01:02:36.185
towards the sky, and put your head up there, like this,

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:40.910
and ask a question, anyone of these questions, three times,

01:02:41.346 --> 01:02:45.718
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.115
or, "Mother,

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:54.266
is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love?"

01:02:54.584 --> 01:03:00.808
or, "Mother is this the Ruh or Brahmachaitanya?"

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:04.337
Ask anyone of these questions,

01:03:05.332 --> 01:03:09.848
in your heart, only three times, anyone of them.

01:03:14.303 --> 01:03:18.055
Now, please take down your hands.

01:03:19.285 --> 01:03:21.625
You'll feel very relaxed.

01:03:21.825 --> 01:03:25.555
And now put your hands like this.

01:03:26.968 --> 01:03:29.085
Those who have felt

01:03:29.285 --> 01:03:35.331
the cool breeze or a hot air from their fontanel bone area,

01:03:35.532 --> 01:03:38.682
or on their fingertips, or on their hands,

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:42.135
please raise both your hands.

01:03:46.681 --> 01:03:51.236
May God bless you. That's it! All of you have got it.

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:55.326
Now, believe in yourself, have faith in yourself,

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:57.184
 that you have got it.

01:03:57.384 --> 01:04:00.295
And don't waste your Self Realization.

01:04:00.495 --> 01:04:02.319
It's very peaceful,

01:04:02.519 --> 01:04:08.716
and all the miracles will start happening in your lives.

01:04:08.916 --> 01:04:12.891
So many will say that

01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:18.637
they have got so many miracles in their lives.

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:22.569
But the most important thing, that you become

01:04:22.824 --> 01:04:28.014
a universal being, you become a collective being,

01:04:28.848 --> 01:04:31.084
and then you realize

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.982
what a potential you had within yourself.

01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:39.102
Respect yourself and respect your Self Realization.

01:04:39.302 --> 01:04:41.818
So may God bless you all.

01:05:13.948 --> 01:05:19.305
You have got pamphlets I am told, where you got the addresses,

01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:21.834
of all the centers we have.

01:05:22.035 --> 01:05:25.486
Please look after your Self Realization.

01:05:25.686 --> 01:05:29.645
Those who have not felt so clearly, should not doubt

01:05:29.845 --> 01:05:32.516
and go and see for yourself.

01:05:32.716 --> 01:05:37.922
In those centers they will help you, explain to you, everything.

01:05:38.389 --> 01:05:42.293
Please understand that you have to grow.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:46.968
This is the beginning which has to grow. May God bless you.

01:06:28.395 --> 01:06:31.973
So if I could have your attention again, just for one moment.

01:06:32.173 --> 01:06:34.916
When you came in with your ticket, you should have been given

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:38.393
a blue piece of paper.

01:06:38.593 --> 01:06:40.435
On this, we have the details

01:06:40.636 --> 01:06:45.418
of the follow-up meetings which we've arranged.

01:06:45.736 --> 01:06:51.909
They are Sunday 27-th of June, that's this coming Sunday, at 3 p.m.,

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:57.376
and on Tuesday, next Tuesday, the 29-th, at 7.30 p.m.,

01:06:57.589 --> 01:07:01.499
and the place is the Remembrance Hall, Flood street,

01:07:01.635 --> 01:07:04.348
in Chelsea.

01:07:06.545 --> 01:07:10.315
On the back of the leaflets, there are details of all the meetings

01:07:10.516 --> 01:07:13.684
which are held throughout London, every week.

01:07:13.885 --> 01:07:17.021
These are regular meetings which happen every week,

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:19.822
and as Shri Mataji has said,

01:07:20.022 --> 01:07:23.111
we very strongly recommend that you come to these meetings

01:07:23.312 --> 01:07:27.082
and we can show you how to meditate at home,

01:07:27.282 --> 01:07:30.781
how to feel the chakras, how to clear the chakras,

01:07:30.982 --> 01:07:33.472
and how to balance the system.

01:07:33.672 --> 01:07:37.804
If you are from outside of London, there are contact phone numbers

01:07:38.005 --> 01:07:39.836
throughout the country.

01:07:40.037 --> 01:07:42.087
If you didn't get one of these leaflets

01:07:42.288 --> 01:07:46.648
we'll arrange to have them available, at the main entrance.

01:07:46.899 --> 01:07:48.854
Thank you very much.

01:08:04.784 --> 01:08:08.858
Tomorrow at 11.45

01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:15.266
we have, here, a great soul, who is a Sahaja Yogi.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:18.061
Come.

01:08:20.872 --> 01:08:22.324
How are you?

01:08:22.525 --> 01:08:26.120
These people are contacting you but you are nowhere to be found!

01:08:26.475 --> 01:08:29.449
You were always missing!

01:08:30.213 --> 01:08:32.775
We are going to have their program,

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.914
tomorrow at 11.45 in the night,

01:08:36.115 --> 01:08:39.212
and they are starting at that time.

01:08:40.911 --> 01:08:44.831
So, if you have time,

01:08:45.610 --> 01:08:49.061
please come along. I'll be here for their program.

01:08:49.261 --> 01:08:52.522
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:55.678
Of course you know them, I need not tell you their names, you see.

01:08:55.878 --> 01:08:58.985
They are very well known people, more known than Me.

01:08:59.231 --> 01:09:00.648
(Hindi - unclear)

01:09:00.849 --> 01:09:03.611
Shivkumar Sharma. Ghulam Mustafa.

01:09:04.804 --> 01:09:08.161
Where were you? What were you doing?

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:12.167
I told them to contact you, because they wanted

01:09:12.367 --> 01:09:15.921
you to come to Cabella and sing this time.

01:09:16.121 --> 01:09:20.525
But you couldn't be contacted.

01:09:21.343 --> 01:09:24.422
Could they?

01:09:25.151 --> 01:09:28.936
So what should we do? When are you going back?
