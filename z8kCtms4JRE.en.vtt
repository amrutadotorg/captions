00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:56.549
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.942
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:18.764
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

00:04:19.373 --> 00:04:22.428
and the wind was blowing from all sides

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:30.988
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:39.169
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.404
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:54.324
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:58.697
that He must have felt.

00:05:00.363 --> 00:05:04.099
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.307
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:15.437
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:20.650
When our attention is on our Spirit,

00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:33.392
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:41.694
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:47.777
complaining about comforts,

00:05:47.978 --> 00:05:53.849
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:04.816
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:15.020
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:22.652
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:29.515
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:34.720
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:39.310
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:41.701
and that goes to My credit, I think,

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:49.761
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:55.860
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:04.933
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

00:07:05.134 --> 00:07:09.624
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:18.637
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:23.543
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:29.541
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:36.145
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:42.117
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

00:07:42.318 --> 00:07:45.910
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:50.552
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:56.292
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

00:07:56.493 --> 00:08:01.991
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

00:08:02.192 --> 00:08:05.596
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

00:08:05.797 --> 00:08:12.431
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:16.708
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:23.075
as we say, is the light,

00:08:24.047 --> 00:08:30.988
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:38.780
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:47.056
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

00:08:47.257 --> 00:08:55.699
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:02.428
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:08.945
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

00:09:09.499 --> 00:09:16.004
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:20.880
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:26.135
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:33.280
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:37.950
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:42.080
can be born in a manger,

00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:46.704
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:55.116
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

00:09:55.317 --> 00:10:02.345
we should make ourselves miserable

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:09.353
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

00:10:09.554 --> 00:10:14.140
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:18.941
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:27.567
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

00:10:27.768 --> 00:10:29.780
That's the main point.

00:10:29.981 --> 00:10:35.710
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:38.713
then He gives you hundred times more.

00:10:38.914 --> 00:10:42.877
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:46.530
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:50.559
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.900
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

00:10:55.101 --> 00:11:00.684
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:08.414
no material well-being, as we call it.

00:11:08.615 --> 00:11:17.808
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

00:11:20.022 --> 00:11:24.895
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

00:11:25.096 --> 00:11:30.580
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:35.101
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

00:11:35.268 --> 00:11:39.897
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

00:11:41.169 --> 00:11:49.025
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

00:11:49.226 --> 00:11:56.806
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

00:11:57.369 --> 00:12:01.270
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:08.843
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

00:12:09.044 --> 00:12:12.274
and in that evaluation

00:12:12.861 --> 00:12:20.362
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:27.132
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:34.330
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:39.677
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

00:12:39.878 --> 00:12:42.745
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:48.186
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.713
because they are not your relations.

00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:56.363
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

00:12:56.564 --> 00:13:03.318
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:09.831
just give them up on this point.

00:13:10.437 --> 00:13:15.000
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

00:13:15.192 --> 00:13:18.532
that we must forgive.

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:23.896
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

00:13:24.256 --> 00:13:27.989
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.550
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

00:13:32.751 --> 00:13:38.186
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

00:13:38.387 --> 00:13:44.728
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

00:13:44.902 --> 00:13:53.896
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:03.942
His life has been a story of spirituality,

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:09.572
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

00:14:09.773 --> 00:14:14.816
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

00:14:14.985 --> 00:14:21.150
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:27.559
as itâ€™s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.731
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:34.591
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:38.096
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

00:14:38.297 --> 00:14:44.529
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.893
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

00:14:49.094 --> 00:14:53.198
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

00:14:53.399 --> 00:15:02.184
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:05.639
He has proved it beyond doubt.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.952
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:16.659
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:27.494
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:32.092
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:34.239
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.191
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

00:15:37.392 --> 00:15:40.302
There have been so many events in this
short time.

00:15:40.503 --> 00:15:44.378
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

00:15:44.579 --> 00:15:47.956
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
