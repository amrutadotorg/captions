1
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:15,974
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

2
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:23,224
who are from this
country, Greece.

3
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:28,544
When first I came
to Greece,

4
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:33,504
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

5
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:39,394
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

6
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:43,414
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

7
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:46,834
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

8
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:52,124
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

9
00:15:52,914 --> 00:16:00,624
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

10
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:05,494
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

11
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:09,594
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

12
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:12,814
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

13
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:16,654
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

14
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,044
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

15
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:25,614
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

16
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:31,814
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

17
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:35,974
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

18
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:41,904
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

19
00:16:44,564 --> 00:16:47,714
because he was busy
with his conference,

20
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:51,884
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

21
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:56,704
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

22
00:16:56,994 --> 00:17:01,924
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

23
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:07,494
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

24
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:12,004
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

25
00:17:12,424 --> 00:17:15,704
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

26
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,814
Now, you have to understand
that you people

27
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:21,414
have a very big responsibility
because you're

28
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:25,904
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

29
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:32,054
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

30
00:17:32,764 --> 00:17:36,844
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

31
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:42,014
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

32
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:45,664
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

33
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:51,274
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

34
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:56,694
I mean the western
countries especially.

35
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:59,584
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

36
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:04,044
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

37
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,504
and which is very
dangerous.

38
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,964
To understand it,
you have to know

39
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:16,064
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

40
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:20,754
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

41
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:28,054
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

42
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:31,334
by your own behavior.

43
00:18:31,614 --> 00:18:35,894
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

44
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:42,494
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

45
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:48,344
and they see that they
can influence very well,

46
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:56,174
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

47
00:18:56,424 --> 00:19:00,394
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

48
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:05,974
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

49
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:11,544
down to earth and
so many, so many

50
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,694
good things you
have known in life,

51
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:21,204
it's very important to
understand the historical

52
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:24,094
background of your country,
first of all.

53
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:29,454
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

54
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:32,604
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

55
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:38,074
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

56
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:43,014
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

57
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:47,484
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

58
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:52,894
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

59
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:55,924
the historical background
of this country

60
00:19:56,484 --> 00:20:02,414
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:06,494
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

62
00:20:06,824 --> 00:20:11,494
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

63
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,494
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

64
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,294
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

65
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,244
Because there was
no connection

66
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:23,174
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

67
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:26,824
this, I mean, translation

68
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:31,814
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

69
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:36,144
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

70
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:42,044
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

71
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:47,014
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

72
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:50,974
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

73
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:57,854
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

74
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:04,824
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

75
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:09,454
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

76
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:14,884
And so, this Athena has
been described,

77
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:19,234
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

78
00:21:19,524 --> 00:21:25,604
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

79
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:29,344
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

80
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:32,654
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

81
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:36,584
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

82
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:39,834
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

83
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:44,514
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

84
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,364
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

85
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:49,764
and everything
and he saw that.

86
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:53,554
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

87
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:56,884
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

88
00:21:57,204 --> 00:22:01,944
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

89
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:06,134
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

90
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:09,934
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

91
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:17,234
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

92
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:22,154
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

93
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,324
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

94
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:31,694
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

95
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:35,384
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

96
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:38,864
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

97
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:43,084
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

98
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:48,374
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

99
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:54,214
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

100
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:57,524
showing that there are two
men and one woman

101
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,834
or two women and one
man and no relationship

102
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,394
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

103
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:07,034
And that was the tragedy.

104
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:10,264
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

105
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,964
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

106
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:16,464
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

107
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:19,944
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

108
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:23,724
What should we do?
Why should we?

109
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:28,954
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

110
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:30,964
We are very
unhappy people.

111
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:34,404
And all these things
started here to begin with.

112
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,844
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

113
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:41,374
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

114
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:45,664
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

115
00:23:45,934 --> 00:23:51,334
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

116
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:55,064
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

117
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:58,184
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

118
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:01,614
That also made women
very left-sided.

119
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:04,634
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

120
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:06,894
with these tragedies
and all that.

121
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:13,874
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

122
00:24:14,154 --> 00:24:17,274
sort of, disgusted
about that.

123
00:24:17,594 --> 00:24:19,724
So the left side
became very,

124
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:23,524
very prominent here
and that is how I think

125
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:26,124
many of these left-sided,

126
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:30,304
bhootish organizations
started here

127
00:24:30,894 --> 00:24:34,834
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

128
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:37,704
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

129
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:40,574
which made you feel so guilty.

130
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:43,924
So you became
very left-sided.

131
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:48,304
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

132
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,054
by people who started
becoming overactive;

133
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:55,284
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

134
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:58,964
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

135
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:01,654
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

136
00:25:01,954 --> 00:25:04,714
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

137
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,434
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

138
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:09,754
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

139
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:16,164
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

140
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:19,784
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

141
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:23,574
what is our historical
background.

142
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,284
The second, they should
be very well equipped

143
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:29,714
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

144
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:36,104
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

145
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:39,244
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

146
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,154
women also should
know everything about it.

147
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:46,044
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

148
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:52,734
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

149
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:55,214
because our chakras
are in danger.

150
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:58,144
All this knowledge
is free to you.

151
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:01,384
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

152
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:05,254
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

153
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:10,964
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

154
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:16,294
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

155
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:20,114
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

156
00:26:20,354 --> 00:26:24,004
that we believe in and we
can show others also

157
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:27,914
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

158
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:30,404
We are not here to
spread some sort

159
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:34,274
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

160
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:37,544
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

161
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:42,144
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

162
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:46,204
and we have one
universal religion.

163
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:48,084
Now, people will ask
you then,

164
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:50,784
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

165
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,474
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

166
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,504
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

167
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,914
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

168
00:26:58,234 --> 00:27:02,774
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

169
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:06,664
Gradually it will start
opening out.

170
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,864
It has happened with
all of you

171
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:10,864
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

172
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:13,904
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

173
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:15,804
you started opening
out, you matured

174
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,794
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

175
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:23,864
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

176
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:28,974
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

177
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:32,384
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

178
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,994
is to be condemned
all the time.

179
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:39,394
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

180
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:43,454
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

181
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,934
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

182
00:27:48,214 --> 00:27:54,464
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

183
00:27:54,734 --> 00:28:00,994
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

184
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:04,134
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

185
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:09,604
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

186
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:14,894
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

187
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:19,264
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

188
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:22,324
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

189
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:25,304
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

190
00:28:25,594 --> 00:28:29,014
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

191
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:31,514
improve yourself,
to help others.

192
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:34,034
You can do everything
yourself.

193
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:37,044
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

194
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,354
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

195
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:43,474
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

196
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:46,804
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

197
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:52,214
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

198
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:55,284
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

199
00:28:55,544 --> 00:29:00,804
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

200
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:08,264
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

201
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:14,214
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

202
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:18,284
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

203
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:25,124
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

204
00:29:25,374 --> 00:29:27,994
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

205
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:32,254
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

206
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:34,574
But apart from that,
you should know

207
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:38,464
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

208
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,254
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

209
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:43,484
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

210
00:29:43,714 --> 00:29:46,394
praying to that one.
What did we get?

211
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:49,264
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

212
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:52,904
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

213
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:56,904
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

214
00:29:57,184 --> 00:30:00,844
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

215
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:05,074
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

216
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:09,594
quite capable person and
you can achieve

217
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:14,404
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

218
00:30:14,634 --> 00:30:17,834
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

219
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:20,424
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

220
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:21,904
race anything.

221
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:23,614
You all can do very well

222
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:28,854
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

223
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:35,934
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

224
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:40,334
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

225
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:43,594
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

226
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,094
about any religion,
anything,

227
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:50,214
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

228
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:53,634
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

229
00:30:53,974 --> 00:30:56,184
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

230
00:30:56,484 --> 00:31:05,164
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

231
00:31:05,534 --> 00:31:07,684
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

232
00:31:07,984 --> 00:31:09,614
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

233
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:12,254
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

234
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:15,884
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

235
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:19,524
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

236
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,654
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

237
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:24,584
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

238
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:26,014
and you'll be amazed

239
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:29,734
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

240
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:32,994
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

241
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,094
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

242
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:37,944
When I came out
I gave them.

243
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:40,064
I said, "Now, what to do?

244
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:42,474
I can't give you
realization just now."

245
00:31:42,754 --> 00:31:44,914
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

246
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:47,094
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

247
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:50,594
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

248
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:53,804
all of them came and
came and sat down

249
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:59,054
in that open ground and
I gave them realization.

250
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,424
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

251
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:08,454
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

252
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:11,674
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

253
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:15,594
and realization is
being given.

254
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:18,614
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

255
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:23,304
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

256
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:28,824
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

257
00:32:30,604 --> 00:32:32,354
No question of their
going back,

258
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:35,004
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

259
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:41,124
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

260
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:45,974
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

261
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:48,754
this democracy has
just harmed us.

262
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:52,194
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

263
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:57,464
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

264
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:01,274
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

265
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:06,094
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

266
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:10,674
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

267
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:13,414
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

268
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:20,334
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

269
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:27,404
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

270
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:33,174
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

271
00:33:33,584 --> 00:33:35,604
and I started talking to
them about science.

272
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:37,114
I thought, better start
with science.

273
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,024
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

274
00:33:39,324 --> 00:33:43,094
Tell us the science
of God."

275
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:46,224
Such open-minded people.

276
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:49,344
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

277
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:54,624
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

278
00:33:58,074 --> 00:34:00,104
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

279
00:34:00,364 --> 00:34:03,544
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

280
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:07,604
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

281
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:11,834
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

282
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:16,804
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

283
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:20,144
And that's very true about
every democratic country

284
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:24,024
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

285
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:28,194
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

286
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:30,904
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

287
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,924
but they are quite
money-oriented.

288
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:35,444
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

289
00:34:35,724 --> 00:34:38,134
but the worst is
the corruption.

290
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:40,654
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

291
00:34:40,934 --> 00:34:43,074
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

292
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:45,044
All these countries
are to be exposed.

293
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:49,214
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

294
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:53,364
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

295
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,934
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

296
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:58,074
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

297
00:34:58,344 --> 00:35:01,274
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

298
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:04,784
that your spirit has
to work everything,

299
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:08,634
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

300
00:35:08,944 --> 00:35:12,484
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

301
00:35:12,824 --> 00:35:15,544
This is what one
has to know.

302
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:19,264
I was told it is very
difficult for you

303
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:23,094
to come for pujas
to Cabella

304
00:35:23,384 --> 00:35:27,014
you all cannot join,
but one week,

305
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:30,954
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

306
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:33,414
You can come by boat
or something like that,

307
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:37,034
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

308
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:40,204
and then we can organize
your coming down.

309
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:43,944
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

310
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:47,644
and Guru Puja are
very important

311
00:35:47,944 --> 00:35:52,544
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

312
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:55,124
I think it can be
arranged and organized

313
00:35:55,424 --> 00:35:59,224
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

314
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:02,794
I know it's wherever I am,

315
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:07,464
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

316
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:11,054
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

317
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:14,674
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

318
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:17,384
nearer to other European
countries.

319
00:36:18,354 --> 00:36:21,024
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

320
00:36:21,284 --> 00:36:24,104
find it very difficult,
so this time

321
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:26,634
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

322
00:36:26,924 --> 00:36:30,424
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

323
00:36:30,704 --> 00:36:34,114
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

324
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:36,154
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

325
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:40,734
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

326
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:45,474
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

327
00:36:48,504 --> 00:36:55,484
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

328
00:36:55,874 --> 00:37:03,324
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

329
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:06,604
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

330
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:11,044
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

331
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:13,374
Please put your attention
towards Me,

332
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:15,294
don't turn your attention
very much.

333
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:20,194
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

334
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:27,654
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

335
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:31,594
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

336
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:34,444
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

337
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:37,144
or are you putting your
attention straight?

338
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:40,774
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

339
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:44,404
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

340
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:50,144
that you have here for
your collective.

341
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:54,244
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

342
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:57,664
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

343
00:37:57,914 --> 00:38:00,184
a state where you
grow spiritually.

344
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:04,364
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

345
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:07,484
where you grow
spiritually.

346
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:09,484
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

347
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:12,454
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

348
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:16,814
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

349
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:19,074
Where are you putting
your attention?

350
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:21,414
If the attention could
be controlled

351
00:38:21,704 --> 00:38:23,744
then things will
be all right.

352
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:26,894
He is crying,
the child is crying,

353
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:30,634
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

354
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:44,634
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

355
00:38:59,694 --> 00:39:01,824
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

356
00:39:02,114 --> 00:39:09,034
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

357
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:12,234
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

358
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:18,944
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

359
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,814
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

360
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:26,584
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

361
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:31,124
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

362
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:37,044
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

363
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:43,394
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

364
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:49,374
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

365
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:55,264
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

366
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:59,974
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

367
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:05,344
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

368
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:09,694
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

369
00:40:10,004 --> 00:40:13,684
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

370
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:15,964
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

371
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:17,904
you can always
write to Me,

372
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:20,094
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

373
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:24,974
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

374
00:40:25,254 --> 00:40:28,174
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

375
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:31,284
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

376
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:36,254
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

377
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,934
You must always
support the collective,

378
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:44,534
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

379
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:48,564
As you know, I was
telling him also

380
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,484
that he, if he has
problem with money,

381
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,464
we can give money
from Cabella

382
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:56,944
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

383
00:40:57,214 --> 00:41:01,134
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

384
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:04,704
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

385
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:07,604
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

386
00:41:07,874 --> 00:41:09,684
because we had such
a small group.

387
00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:13,494
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

388
00:41:13,794 --> 00:41:16,114
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

389
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:22,184
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

390
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:26,804
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

391
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,444
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

392
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,764
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

393
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,874
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

394
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:38,604
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

395
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,394
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

396
00:41:41,654 --> 00:41:44,904
So best is to keep
to your own,

397
00:41:45,594 --> 00:41:50,484
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

398
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:54,874
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

399
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:58,054
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

400
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:00,584
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

401
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:03,024
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

402
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,844
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

403
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:09,964
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

404
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:14,924
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

405
00:42:15,214 --> 00:42:17,714
You can wash
yourself up, like,

406
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:19,984
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

407
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:22,204
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

408
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:25,804
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

409
00:42:26,094 --> 00:42:28,674
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

410
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:32,304
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

411
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:34,754
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

412
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:38,554
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

413
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:42,084
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

414
00:42:42,464 --> 00:42:47,184
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

415
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:52,404
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

416
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:57,224
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

417
00:42:57,554 --> 00:43:00,724
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

418
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:04,924
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

419
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:09,104
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

420
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:13,474
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

421
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:16,214
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

422
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:18,964
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

423
00:43:19,254 --> 00:43:24,024
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

424
00:43:24,374 --> 00:43:28,794
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

425
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:34,844
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

426
00:43:35,184 --> 00:43:37,514
your family, your society,
everybody,

427
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:41,414
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

428
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:45,054
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

429
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:47,274
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

430
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:53,214
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

431
00:43:53,824 --> 00:43:58,524
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

432
00:43:58,824 --> 00:44:01,374
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

433
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:03,684
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

434
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:06,144
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

435
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:08,554
and try to increase
this area,

436
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:10,754
this space of thoughtless
awareness

437
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:15,134
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

438
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:19,654
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

439
00:44:19,984 --> 00:44:22,674
being realized by you,
curing by you,

440
00:44:22,924 --> 00:44:25,454
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

441
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:29,974
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

442
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:33,254
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

443
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:36,074
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

444
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:39,534
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

445
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:42,264
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

446
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:46,514
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

447
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:50,044
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

448
00:44:50,334 --> 00:44:53,604
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

449
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:56,314
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

450
00:44:56,624 --> 00:45:00,614
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

451
00:45:00,884 --> 00:45:03,304
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

452
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:08,694
and you can feel it,
the different centers

453
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:11,314
on your fingertips
about yourself.

454
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:15,984
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

455
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:18,354
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

456
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:21,534
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

457
00:45:21,794 --> 00:45:25,034
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

458
00:45:25,354 --> 00:45:28,314
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

459
00:45:28,574 --> 00:45:30,244
So the language is
to change now.

460
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:35,564
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

461
00:45:36,264 --> 00:45:40,124
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

462
00:45:40,414 --> 00:45:43,644
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

463
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:48,544
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

464
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:51,354
We have to use them,
that's the point.

465
00:45:51,594 --> 00:45:53,784
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

466
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:55,914
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

467
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:58,594
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

468
00:45:58,854 --> 00:46:00,824
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

469
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,924
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

470
00:46:03,164 --> 00:46:04,634
and it works out.

471
00:46:04,974 --> 00:46:07,334
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

472
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:10,254
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

473
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,804
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

474
00:46:13,054 --> 00:46:16,074
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

475
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:18,864
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

476
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:23,114
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

477
00:46:23,404 --> 00:46:26,284
how you have achieved
all these things.

478
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:29,744
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

479
00:46:30,024 --> 00:46:32,814
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

480
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,174
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

481
00:46:35,484 --> 00:46:37,894
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

482
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:39,584
"Who were those people

483
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:44,754
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

484
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:47,824
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

485
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:50,574
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

486
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:53,174
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

487
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,744
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

488
00:46:56,024 --> 00:47:00,094
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

489
00:47:00,414 --> 00:47:02,574
So, I again tell
you that Greece

490
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:04,904
is a place where
you can do a lot.

491
00:47:05,184 --> 00:47:08,204
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

492
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:11,624
and you have to
know what you are,

493
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:14,344
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

494
00:47:14,634 --> 00:47:16,844
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

495
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:19,884
so they also develop that
personality by which

496
00:47:20,194 --> 00:47:23,064
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

497
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:26,134
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

498
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:32,294
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

499
00:47:32,574 --> 00:47:36,394
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

500
00:47:36,634 --> 00:47:39,504
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

501
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:42,254
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

502
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:46,354
It's a new age
that has started.

503
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:49,964
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

504
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:52,694
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

505
00:47:53,004 --> 00:47:55,634
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

506
00:47:55,934 --> 00:48:00,074
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

507
00:48:00,384 --> 00:48:04,784
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

508
00:48:05,114 --> 00:48:08,234
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

509
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,384
and that you have
got your realization

510
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:12,654
and that you are
one of those

511
00:48:12,964 --> 00:48:17,924
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

512
00:48:18,214 --> 00:48:20,234
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

513
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:24,414
It's another point because
what I know about is that

514
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:29,324
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

515
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:32,554
many were lost
in between, you know,

516
00:48:32,854 --> 00:48:36,604
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

517
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,544
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

518
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,774
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

519
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:46,134
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

520
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:48,644
that they have formed.

521
00:48:49,004 --> 00:48:50,884
But your responsibility
is very great.

522
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:53,994
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

523
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:55,614
Never. Never think
like that.

524
00:48:55,894 --> 00:48:59,654
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

525
00:48:59,974 --> 00:49:02,494
May God bless you.
