Shri Devi Puja. Rahuri (Hindistan)
26 Ocak 1984

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.860
Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.940
that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.110
started ruling this area and devastating it.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.900
The whole suffered, all the God-fearing people ….

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.360
Then the Goddess took Her incarnation

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.480
here and She killed this man, this rakshasa

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.030
and there are different places

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.480
where how he ran, how She caught him

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.480
and ultimately killed – he was killed in Rahuri.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:39.030
And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.110
as you know that: Aim, Klim, Hrim

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.110
are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.820
Aim, Hrim and Klim: Aim is the Mahakali,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.480
Hrim is the Mahalakshmi and Klim is the Mahasaraswati.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.360
So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.030
and then – after that killing –

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.110
bhaktas started living here.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.280
And a king came all the way from Rajpur,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.480
Rajputana – and started worshipping the Goddess.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.820
And went – he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man –

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.820
while worshipping the Goddess

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.480
he raised this again into another kingdom,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.360
and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.820
because they carry the shawl of the Goddess.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.150
This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a [INDIST., SOUNDS LIKE Bhobruvaha]

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.110
who fought with the [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE Maharaja]

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.820
and defeated him, who was from Ujiara [?]. Surprisingly

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.900
many of My relations are still in Ujiara

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.980
and they are following a new vision.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.110
So because he fought him

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.820
and he captured him

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.980
many people from here shifted there

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.230
and settled down in Ujiara.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.440
Now this Rahuri developed gradually

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.900
into a very modern city,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.480
or you can say in a modernized.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.280
And when we go to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Nankhara] you will be able to see it.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.480
The forefathers

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.400
of Mine were called as Shalivahanas

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.900
and My mother`s place [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Rhaduvas] where they resided and lived.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.820
So Rahuri has a special significance

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.820
in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.320
And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.070
our center in the biggest way.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.070
Because the kings here worshipped

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.280
the Mother with a shawl.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.820
Now this has a special meaning as the significance

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.820
goes, or you can say the symbolic - it is -

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.980
it covers the modesty of the Mother.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.480
Mother protects us, She looks after us.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.820
So this is the one which covers Her,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.940
gives Her the grace,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.070
gives Her the protection from the cold

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.480
and when the children are suffering,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.110
or are tired, or are sick She covers them with the shawl.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.400
So the shawl has a very big meaning

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.230
and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.480
all the time in their hands,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.780
that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.320
So the significance of Rahuri is very great

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.480
and you will also see that

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:29.150
in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.480
Even the factory people – I went to see them before I came here,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.860
to talk to them. And they are so much submerged

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.070
in the developments of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.230
and amount of things they want to do,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.480
and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.820
As they are built for you especially too

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.360
was made with great care about from that they thought

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.820
that it was finished and worked very hard.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.780
Day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.150
So this is how it is going to work out,

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.820
and last time I told them that you should not make

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.360
an alcohol out of these molasses

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.900
[??] and sell it at the market at a cheap rate,

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.280
but make something useful.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.940
So they are trying to find out

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.230
a technique about which I talked to them now.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.480
So they are very religious people also.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.110
And they are trying to improve the lot of the people,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.480
by removing all these addictions among the people.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.480
So that is the significance of Rahuri-Puja

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.860
and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.440
who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.480
So today’s Puja has a special significance

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.480
– that’s why Rahuri we have very good Sahaja Yogis here,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.940
very developed, very evolved, moral people.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.400
They are not scholars of Sanskrit,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.940
but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.980
There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.320
and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:20.030
Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.360
stay for you here and

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.230
we hope also for the future you are going to enjoy

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.820
your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:46.360
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.320
We don’t read about Rahul`s killing,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.110
because it is Mahalakshmi who killed,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.480
but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.820
But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.110
and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.280
so that’s why this is Rahu-ri.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:39.030
Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.780
And according to that calendar only

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.480
all the Maharashtrians are living,

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.440
which is very, I should say, much more subtler than vikram,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.400
this thing. Because in the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: vikram-panjaga]

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.780
this area is still called as Kali-Yuga, Kali-Yuga,

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.360
but in this [INDIST: SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga; Then: Shalivahana-Panjaga]

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.190
it is called as Krita-Yuga. It’s much subtler.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.440
That’s a very wider thing

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.820
and it doesn’t give you the different sections

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.110
of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita-Yuga

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.320
and ultimately a Satya-Yuga.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:10.480
The calendar that was used by the North Indians

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.480
was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.360
but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.110
[INDIST.] direct, who said that this is the better [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga]

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:30.400
because it deals with subtler side of time.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.440
Subtler side of time.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.480
And that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.230
Now on the first day of

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.230
this calendar they put a kalasha

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:53.820
[? A pot] with a shawl as a banner, a kalasha and a shawl as a banner.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:00.110
That’s why kalash, which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:14:24.860
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.480
In the older days all the Maharashtrian women used to have

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:34.480
some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.440
If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.480
[INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: completed with that shawl].

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.070
All the time they had to wear something, a covering over the sari.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.230
Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.480
so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which one has to use.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.480
So, but this is only the custom.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.030
In India is not the point, it is not only in Maharashtra, everywhere.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.480
But there, because a dress was not a sari,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.900
but those who bore the sari did not use, in the North.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.150
But here those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.400
And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.900
this part that they always had this shawl,

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.110
whether they went out, for their protection,

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.480
or they went for a marriage

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.940
or anything they used to have another thing on top.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.230
Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.110
This is, wearing little pieces to be used as shawls.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.230
You see, everything is getting modernized.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:16:12.480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.480
You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri-Land.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:24.860
Then after, Ganesha, we must also touch the feet.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.070
As soon as I get the land, first we establish Ganesha here,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.030
and once this land, we get

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.400
everywhere in the whole world, we get land

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.440
and we have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.440
When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.480
we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:15.480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.110
They have come all the way from Germany.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:21:00.480
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi; then the Puja starts]

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.030
[during the Puja:] Husband and wife, are you? Ha?

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.400
You both are husband and wife – are you?

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.400
You have to be husband and wife! [Yogi: Yes!]

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:30.480
Shri Mataji: You are? You both are husband and wife? [Yogi: Not!]

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:38.480
Shri Mataji: Yes! [Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.820
Means: the husband and wife should sit together!

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.110
That’s the only time when a man and a woman

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.940
sits together in this country. Not the brother.

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:55.480
Not even sisters and brothers. Only husband and wife.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:16.900
[Puja continues]
