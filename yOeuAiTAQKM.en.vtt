00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.680
This centre what we call as "left Vishuddhi".

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.440
Now have you told them about left Vishuddhi?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.440
Not, not specific sides, you know, just the general principle.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.520
All right. Now, this left Vishuddhi comes to you

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.000
if you have said mantras wrongly.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.920
You see, the mantras are to be said only when there is

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.960
a realised soul who knows what mantras are to be said.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.760
And if you do not know

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880
about it, you accept the mantras.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.600
Anybody who tells you, "Say this mantra", you just start saying it,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.320
without understanding, whether it is given by an authority or not.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.760
Also you don't know whether it is meant for you or not.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.680
Maybe it is not required for some.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.320
Any particular mantra may not be required.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.680
And some of the mantras are absolutely absurd things.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.200
So mantras also, it's a very big science.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.160
And just now I am feeling the left Vishuddhi.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.320
Also one feels it, even if you have not taken mantras, if

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.160
you have been feeling guilty.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.680
Like, you see, if you are used to confessions and things like that,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.240
if you are used to a situation where you feel that

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.960
"I'm guilty for this". You know, the norms of today's modern life

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.960
are so funny, that even for small thing you have to feel guilty.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.240
For example if you put the fork in a wrong way,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.080
you feel guilty: "Oh God, I should not have done this."

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.160
Like that, the life is so complicated,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.440
but very, very small things can also make you feel guilty.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.280
So if you are feeling guilty also you feel this centre very much.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.360
Now, this centre is very important, because

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.120
if this centre is not all right, then Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.640
She pulls

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.560
this, at this point. Half of it is pulled out.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.880
And there is a blockage. And so Kundalini does not rise.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.080
Now, one should not feel guilty about anything, whatsoever!

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.720
There is nothing to feel guilty or to going for confessions

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.360
and all the time saying, "I am such a sinner"

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.080
and I should not have done this and I should not have done that.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.400
Because, as I told you yesterday, God is the ocean of love,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.640
He is the ocean of compassion and He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.120
So we should not unnecessarily condemn ourselves.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.600
Moreover you are the temple of God.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.680
And if you condemn yourself like that,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.600
that "I'm good for nothing, I am useless",

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.360
then you are condemning that temple which is created by God.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.440
You have not created yourself.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.920
So you have no right to condemn yourself.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.720
Now little mistakes if you have done doesn't matter.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.760
Because I am talking of the ocean.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.320
So little mistakes here and there can always be corrected.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.200
So one should not feel guilty.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.240
Now see, are you feeling the vibrations now? Let's see.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.800
Can I ask? Can you hear Mother over there?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.280
Come along. If you can't hear, come along here!

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.200
Can you come? There is some nice space over, just around here,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.160
if there is anybody at the back who can't hear.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.760
It's a little difficult with the traffic noises.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.840
Mother is talking about this center

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.880
which is represented on this finger here.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.040
and saying that it can catch if,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.440
if there are mantras spoken which are inappropriate.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.240
If the mantras being spoken

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.520
or chanted are wrong, are inappropriate

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.840
or there is not an authority to use those mantras,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.720
then the left Vishuddhi is out.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.400
And at the moment Mother is feeling that left Vishuddhi here.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.400
Also another reason for that is a sense of guilt.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.760
If you feel a sense of guilt, guilt for anything that you've done.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.960
And Mother is pointing out that...

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.720
that guilt, I mean, what have we done?

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.720
Little, little things, whatever sins that we have committed.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.760
How can we feel guilty when God is

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.200
all compassion, all love, all forgiveness?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.640
So it's forgiving others and forgiving ourselves

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.360
and also stopping unauthorized mantras,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.360
which can clear that catch, on this,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.440
which is represented on this left finger here, the left Vishuddhi.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.120
That means you have to be cheerful people.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.640
When you are entering into the kingdom of God

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.680
you have to be cheerful people.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.960
Now, so many people who have a heart trouble

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.120
are very much affected by this blockage.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.200
If there is, this blockage is there, it's difficult

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.520
to cure the heart of a person.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.480
So first of all we should say that, "We are not guilty at all."

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.480
Believe Me, you are not guilty.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.720
If you believe Me, it will work out.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.200
- It's better now? - The same.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.000
Same? Not feeling anything?

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.960
Put it up. It will help you. Better now.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.320
- Are you feeling guilty? - I'm not feeling anything.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.280
- But are you feeling guilty? - I try not to.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.840
She tries not to.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.320
But why... Just say, "I'm not guilty." Can you say that?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.800
"Mother, I am not guilty!" Say within yourself.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.080
Just say it honestly. You say that you are not guilty, that's all.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.200
Better now? Working out.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.320
Just say one little thing, that "Mother, I am not guilty."

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.960
This is a mantra to overcome this center.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.680
It is a simple mantra to say that.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.240
"Mother, I am not guilty" is the mantra for the left Vishuddhi.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.080
Just put your hands straight.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.600
From Hamsa.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.200
- Are you all right? - Yes!

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.160
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.320
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.560
What about you, people? You're feeling it? Good!

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
- Are you still not feeling? - Little warm.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.280
Warm, all right, doesn't matter, warm will be all right.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.640
Now first of all let us correct, that there should be a feeling,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.920
already starting. It may be that it is little warm, all right.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.960
Now, this one, this finger is little bit touching.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.960
Now, this is a very important finger

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.120
because this represents your heart, the organ. The heart.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.200
That means you have to accept that you are the Spirit.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.720
Because the Spirit resides in your heart.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.440
So you have to accept that you are the heart.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.360
And Spirit cannot commit any mistakes also.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.840
So both things go hand in hand.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.560
You have to accept that you are the Spirit.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.880
So you can again put your right hand on your..

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.760
This finger here - the left heart

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.360
which is the source of the Spirit.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.680
No, is the Spirit inside.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.560
So you have to say, "I am the Spirit."

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.840
Say it with full confidence: "I am the Spirit!"

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.120
Spirit means the Atma

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.840
and not the spirit that we know of the spirits

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.240
that about which I'm going to tell you tonight.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.760
Better now?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.320
It can't even cross Hamsa.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.000
Are you feeling better, by saying that?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.120
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.720
You had some guru or someone? - No.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.600
No.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.760
Don't worry! It will work out.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.280
I'm going to see everyone individually.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.920
All right? But let's see how far it goes. We can do it.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.400
Better. It's improving.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.680
Mother earth is very nice.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.480
I have to bow to Australia, this land, to suck in your problems.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.960
Started sucking.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.720
So now it's cooled down.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.360
All right?

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.120
You came today or you have come yesterday. Yesterady or today?

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.680
Now, if you are feeling hot, very hot, the thing, if it is,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.880
the sensation is hot

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.200
that means first of all, you must be having a liver problem.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.200
If not, you could have been to some guru

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.040
and that's why there is an opposition.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.240
So now, what you do, is to put your right hand on your liver.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.000
I'm sorry, left hand on your liver.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.520
Left hand on your liver.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.720
Better.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.040
Is it still hot now? Better now? Better.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.160
Please put it comfortably on your lap.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.960
All the skin troubles come from liver.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.840
Allergies come from lethargic liver.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.160
And those who have other troubles of the liver, like

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.160
sometimes you feel like vomiting, nauseating,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.520
your attention is not all right, all that comes from bad liver.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.640
So for that we have to understand that,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.160
carbohydrates are required

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.400
to compensate for the over-activity that you are doing.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.760
Now, if you get tonight some sugar and salt,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.960
all of you, I will vibrate it for you and you can use it.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.280
That will solve your problem of the liver. It's better now.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.760
Just put it like that, straight. Are you feeling better?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.400
- It's cold. - See, it cooled down.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.640
Now don't doubt, it is cool.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.520
I mean cool and hot, even a child can say.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.440
So there is nothing to doubt.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.680
The meeting, Mother, is tomorrow night.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.520
I'm sorry, tomorrow night. The meeting is tomorrow night.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.240
For those who didn't hear what Mother said (rice and) sugar and salt,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.280
you bring in to the programm on Monday night

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.360
and She will vibrate it. You put it with your household supply

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.160
and then it will be vibrated and will clear these problems

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.040
which we are speaking about. So bring a small quantity,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.520
maybe half a kilo, something like that.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:31.480
Also water. If you have got spring water, you can bring spring water

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.520
because this water is very troublesome.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.080
Yes, spring water is better.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.880
Thanks to floods.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.520
Sit down! How are you today? All right? Good morning.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.920
It's better.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.800
Now one has to know that the

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.160
sprouting of the seed has taken place.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.440
But to make it grow more

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.800
you have to work on other people.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.920
You have to give it to others.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.520
If you don't learn to share it, then it doesn't grow.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.840
It will again subside. And it will be,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.120
you will feel that you have lost your vibrations.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.520
So the best thing would be

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.360
that you must learn how to give it to others.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960
Now who is feeling cool breeze among you

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.040
can come and now try on this gentleman.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.520
Let's see one or two persons, let's try how it works out.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.600
Anybody would like to try? All right.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.200
I'm just going to show you how to work it out [in a kind of a show].

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.880
Go forward, if you're feeling the cool breeze.- One or two persons,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.440
now come along.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.400
Now come along. You sit down here.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.040
Come along.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.840
Sit down like this, all right? So all of you can see them.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.000
Now, can you come to work Warren.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.720
As it is now you are putting both the hands towards Me.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.320
All right? First of all.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.400
Now when I'm not there, you can use My photograph

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.600
because photograph also has got vibrations.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.320
Till you feel all right you can use it, the photograph. All right.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.320
She is very pale and liver is very bad.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.920
I think she's... You've been to this divine light business?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.040
I do not know it. I do not know it.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.160
She's been a disciple of the Guru Maharaji.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.720
No, I haven't got knowledge, I've just been going to the meetings.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.080
Going to the meetings, same thing.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.440
Knowledge, never have God knowledge. ( You'll never get it anyway.)

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.280
All right, now, yes, all right, now put your hand -

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.360
you never get the knowledge, you get the mesmerism. All right.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.320
Put it on that... let's see. Now, let's see now.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.640
You just tell Me... Please put your left hand towards Me,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:55.520
and right hand on top and tell Me what do you feel on your fingers.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.760
- Get heat on left, Mother. - That's all right.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.960
You have been to some guru also. Have you not been?

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.560
You see, if it is catching on the left hand side

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.120
that means either you have some emotional problem

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.080
or you have been to a wrong guru. All right?

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.440
That's it. She too has the same problem.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.760
- All right? - Heat on the left side.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.840
Now, what you do you put your hand down there

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.880
and you have to say that

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.600
"Mother, I'm my own guru!" Just say that.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.720
Establish your guru principle, that's all.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.280
Say it in your heart now.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.880
"I am my own master, I am my own guru."

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.280
You all can do it. Those who have been to guru you all can do it.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.840
Please put your...

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.920
as they have put left hand towards Me and right hand here.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.960
Come over and do it here. One of you come over here and do it.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.360
Better? Go on saying that.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.400
Just close your eyes and say that.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.320
Just close your eyes and say "Mother, I am my own guru."

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.280
Just say that.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.400
Things will improve, you'll see that.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.480
It starts to cool down on the left hand.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.240
Now better? See, see it is...

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.960
Better now.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.080
All right. Good? All right now?

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.040
All right, now this is your mantra for the time beeing.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.000
Is to say "Mother, I am my own guru."

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.000
Use My photograph and you have to say that.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.680
And it will be corrected. See now.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.840
This is better. Can you see in your finger?

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.680
You see, see how fingers are.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.320
You see, there is enlightenment in this part.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.040
But this part is still not so good, all right?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.840
Now, this kind of a hand, if you see, yellowish colour, all right?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.600
It means liver. This is a liver patient,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.120
definitely a liver patient, this one.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:22.560
Now, for such a hand, what should you do, is to take

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.640
the water that I've given you

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.880
and boil it with radish leaves.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.800
And take radish leaves and sugar with it.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.800
That water you have to take for some time.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.080
Specially when you have this flood water.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.200
After that you should be careful, because people can get jaundice.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.000
You see, this flood is not such a disaster.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.240
The after effects of floods are. This water is not good,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.080
you should not take any other water but spring water.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.480
Spring water you should drink

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.440
and as far as possible be careful about jaundice.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.840
If jaundice sets in, the only solution is that

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.520
you should take radish leaves, eat lot of radish

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.600
and boil it in that water that I give you today

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.880
and put some sugar in it

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.200
and just take that water, nothing else.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.920
Because that's one thing one has to be careful

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.840
when such a flood comes in

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.840
the after effects of the floods can be felt.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.560
All right? So we have to save the Realised souls.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.440
They are very precious to God.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.080
And you must know how to save yourself from all these problems.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.760
So you are - you should go when you drink the water today

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.480
you also radish leaves, you should take. Boil them.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.720
All right? It doesn't taste very well, put the sugar in it.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.440
And you take that water for some time

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.640
and not any other water, as far as possible, say 2 days or 3 days.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.360
Immediately you will find, this will go away

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.840
and you will feel better. Now, it's better now.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.320
It's the colour is much better, can you see that?

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.880
It's much better colour now? The red is coming now, see?

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.160
It's much better, see, but

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.400
it has to be done in such a way that it's established.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.040
See now her hand. See now, her hand is better? You see?

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.520
This is normal colour, that redness, all right?

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.960
Still yellow, still yellow, but not that much.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.680
It's very yellow thing, all right?

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.760
Jaundice. Do you get jaundice in this country?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.680
Yes, very much.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.760
So one should know how to treat jaundice and

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.600
look after yourself. Jaundice is really, could be fatal and

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.480
it's very dangerous, because it spoils your liver very badly.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.000
So, to be on safe side, eat lot of radish

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.800
and also take that water as I told you, for your jaundice.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.800
Are you all right now?

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.920
Now let us see two other people. All right, come.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.320
Coulple of other people come forward.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.440
Now you come here. Both of you. Let's start.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.200
Now, who will try? [Hindi/Marathi]

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.520
One more person who would like to work.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.160
Anyone who wants to work out?

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.480
You see, they are here. Why don't you come? Come here, that's it.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.960
You have been to some gurus?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.160
Which one?

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.560
None specifically. None specifically.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.400
- To everyone. - No, I just moved around.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.720
You are a seeker. All right, doesn't matter!

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.760
So for you the best is, first of all to put this hand down there.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.960
And you have to say, that "Mother, I'm my own guru."

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.360
Is she getting cool breeze on her head?

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.200
Cool. You work on here.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.080
Here, you just work on him. He's a difficult...

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.960
Is it cool on her head? - Yes.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.760
It's all right. Are you feeling all right, My child?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.760
Put your left hand to Mother,

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.920
and your right hand and left hand. You tell Her what you feel.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.880
Give him a bandhan.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.440
We do this to protect the...

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.600
See this hands are shaking on the right.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.080
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.360
- Still shaking. - Shaking. [Hindi/Marathi]

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.320
Somebody else come on here.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.720
I'll just tell you what is to be done.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.520
Now, if your right hand shakes before the photograph...

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.320
You see, there are so many permutations and combinations,

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.960
but some of the major ones, I'll tell you.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.040
If the right hand shakes means you work very hard, first of all,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.360
you think too much of the future,

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.880
you are using too much of your right side energy, which I will show.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.320
[Hindi/Marathi] No time for the family!

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.760
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.240
Under these, under these circumstances

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.120
you have to put your right hand towards the photograph

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.760
or towards Me just now

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.320
and put your left hand - if your right hand is shaking.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.880
Is it shaking now? See for yourself!

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.440
You put your right hand to Mother

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.760
And the other on the Mother Earth!

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.360
If your right hand is hot or shaking put your right hand

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.080
to the Mother and your left hand on the earth.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.560
Just for those people only.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.960
-Hot or more hot on the left or shaking.- Centre heart.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.120
Put it towards Mother and the other hand on the earth.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.760
You get asthma?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.960
What you're doing is you are acting as a transmitter

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.720
or the battery, and cool.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.120
Now, is he all right? - Is he getting cooler?

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.440
Now, will you say that "Mother, I am my own teacher",

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.920
"I am my own Guru"?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.120
We don't have to search any gurus.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.960
Is somebody getting the right hand shaking? Just see. Sit down.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.560
Check it now! Everybody just check it, to see how the right hand is.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.360
- [Hindi/Marathi] - Still very hot.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.400
Work on this. It's a little blocked. It's severely hot

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.400
here, Mother, on when she's feeling.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.240
All right? Press it hard.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.200
She's feeling a severe heat there.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.080
Press it hard.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.280
He must have taken some drugs also. Left Nabhi is also.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.960
Did you take some drugs?

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.560
Not so much.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.400
But you did sometimes. Because you see, everything has an effect.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.080
A little bit. Now, let's see, is better?

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.960
Are you married? - No.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.240
So you will be marrying. You've not decided not to marry, have you?

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.160
(- That's right! -) You will marry in case, ?

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.960
You're quit happy to get married, are you?

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.440
Yes, all right. Now see, better?

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.520
Are you feeling less heat on left? Less heat.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.880
Not completely gone, but it's less.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.760
Less. o.k., that's clear then.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.280
See how you are feeling.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.760
You see, you are yourself feeling now.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.480
Yesterday you got your Realization, today you are feeling it!

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.080
Now tell them how to raise the Kundalini! All of you can see

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.600
how to raise the Kundalini of other people. Can you see them?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.120
Tell them how to do it! There you are.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.560
Put your hand down at the bottom of the lowest chakra.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.400
And you work in this fashion.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.440
[One station here]. This is  left Swadisthana.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.840
Means you have been to some guru also before.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.800
- Christianity, Christianity. - Christian, Christianity, Mother.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.200
Christianity.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.920
Keeping your eyes closed at first to keep your attention inside,

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.840
then turn it about seven times and knot it once.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.560
Bring it down like that

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.440
and again same.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.720
Keep your attention inside.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.480
Now tell them also. All right. Better now. -Turn it.-

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.960
Even you see, Christianity that we follow is not actual,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.760
you see, because they don't give you actually the baptism.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.680
It's all artificial stuff going on in Christianity.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.400
All right? And I'll better see

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.280
Better now? [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.480
Three times and bring it down. Now check the vibrations

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.240
and you'll find that there might be a slight increase

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.520
in the vibrations. Keep your eyes closed.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.640
Tremendous you are, really! He is getting vibratory sensation.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.120
Don't let your attention [go here and there] just while

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.160
you're checking the vibrations and keep your attention inside.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.920
You've been a catholic ?

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.880
That's why. Catholicism has given guilt.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.440
That's how, they put you down.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.760
I was converted to Catholicism. I was converted.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.960
A convert, Mother, she's saying she was a convert.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.760
She wasn't born a Catholic.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.520
Oh, I see. That was a mistake.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.960
But don't think of the mistake. It's all right.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.040
You can feel it. Now better?

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.720
And the other you can balance it out.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.560
Christ is the essence of Christianity,

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.760
but not necessarily what has happened since.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.160
He understands that.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.400
Better now? Much better?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.120
Isn't she better now? - Yes.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.120
Yes. Now this lady was a convert, say of Catholicism.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.640
She went to Catholicism. And you know that

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.680
Christianity that is practised is not true Christianity,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.680
in the sense, they do not give you the actual baptism.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.480
Is artificial. Now in Sahaja Yoga you get the actual baptism.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.920
And you start feeling it on your head.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.960
And in her seeking she went out. [unclear- be careful]

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.600
Are better. So now, it's better now?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.480
You are feeling it balanced on both hands?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.200
Just come here. Tell her to ask Me the question of Holy Ghost.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.040
Come here, you'll feel better. Come here. He'll tell you something.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.600
Are you better?

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.480
Did you feel cool breeze?

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.400
I didn't feel any sensations.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.760
He didn't feel any in the hands.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.720
Just work on him. Robert, come along, work on him.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.360
Go, go down there, then work out.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.320
Now ask the question three times.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.760
Do you get the vibrations?

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.760
The vibrations being the truth, all right?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.160
It's nice!

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.600
All right? It's great!

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.800
May God bless you! Enjoy yourself! Close your eyes.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.240
But you have a little bit [disturbance].

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.720
Turn around, I would like to put your [unclear]. Just turn around.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.720
Turn around. Come back. Can I open your zip a little?

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:08.120
Now, hold your breath for a minute.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.080
Leave it.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.560
All right? Feeling better now?

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.120
- I'm free. - Free?

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.160
All right? Good. May God bless you!

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.080
Now let's have two other people.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.080
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.760
Come on. Now that was the two of them.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.240
They are husband and wife. See, that's indian style.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.160
Can you sit to one side, so the camera can record it. That's it.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.240
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.080
Couple more people that aren't feeling it. Come on,

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.440
you come and feel it and then you can come next time. Come on.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.600
Now come along, two people should feel it

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.320
and two people should sit down and see for themselves.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.360
Please stand here. Left hand to Mother.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.280
[Hindi/Marathi] back problem.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.280
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.080
Give a description of what you're feeling on your hand,

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.480
[unclear] your left hand.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.640
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.440

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.440
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.920
So, what do you feel? On your right hand or on your left hand?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.800
First on your right hand. Heat?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.880
Yes.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.960
Are you feeling cool or...?

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.240
Heat here or cool here?

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.840
Hot or cold here?

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.040
Here is cold.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.360
And here?

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.600
That is hot, no doubt!

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.080
SM: Now, this is a professor of mathematics,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.360
and he works very hard. See doubly problematic.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.280
So he works very hard, he uses right side too much

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.480
so he has to be raised from the left to the right, all right?

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.640
Did you get her [all right]?

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.040
Now, better?

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.560
Is case cold?

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.120
Cooler?

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.400
- Is it becoming more cool? - Yes.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.400
Yes, that's it. See just by giving balance, it's becoming more cool.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.200
-More, more, yes.- Isn't it? More and more. That's true.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.680
Just see, this is still hot.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.120
Yes.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.720
Is it all right?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.800
[unclear]

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.960
Left side?

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.000
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.960
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.240
It's cool! Comes up very strong.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.680
We can feel it coming up from the head.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.360
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.920

If you say something instantly is [unclear].

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.840
Let's sort it out like that.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.720

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.720
- Now... - Getting the balance.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.320

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.520
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:36.280
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.960
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.280
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.800
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:50.760
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.520
It's very cool now Mother. He felt it was...

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.080
He's all right. He's all right. He's all right now.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:06.400
Now, all right? Good.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.280
This gentleman is feeling

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.640
more on his right and not very much on his left at all.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.880
Left hand not getting very much sensations.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.320
Yours? Yourself. All right, we'll see you. It's easy.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.120
[Hindi/Marathi] Certified.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.240
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.240
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.800
Just sit down and Mother will work on you.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.360
Come right forward now. Come in two.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.280
Now, who else? Now who would like to feel?

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.960
Could you come?

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.360
Yes, yes, let her come!

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.480
Come along.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.840
But the wife should not treat the husband.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.600
It is not a very good idea. - So you work on this man.-

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.280
You work on this man.- She can work on this one.-

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.640
While the left side [pains] you see.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.480
Now you've been to some gurus or something?

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.440
Which one?

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.400
- Any number? - Yes, several.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.680
All right. Now put your right hand down down.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.200
All right? Now see now.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.160
What's happening? Can you feel it hot on the left?

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.760
You have to say that, "Mother, I am my own guru!"

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.440
Just say it loudly.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.320
Again! You have to say 10 times, all right?

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.960
"Mother, I am my own guru."

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:33.200
"Mother, I am my own guru!"

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.520
Void. Cool?

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.320
Yes. I think it's void.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.280
It's cooling down! All right? Better now?

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.360
Stomach is very much caught up. All right?

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.840
- It's gone now. -Since I was a child I think I had tension here.-

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.600
All right, doesn't matter. - Just keep still,

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.360
we're working on you, you see.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.520
Keep looking at Mother. Just look at Her, all right?

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.480
Yesterday you felt the thing there, is it?

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.040
Little bit cool above his head is. (unclear)

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.160
You see, going to these Gurus is very dangerous.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.960
Because there are ten centres in the stomach.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.920
There are ten petals on that Nabhi chakra, as you call.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.520
Nabhi means the solar plexus.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.760
Now what happens, that if you go to these gurus,

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.680
this blockage takes place

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.480
and it works out here, what we call as Ekadesha.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.240
And when it starts working out here

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.040
cancer can be set in. Anything can be then set in.

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.080
So these gurus can be very dangerous.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.800
One should never take them seriously.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.800
Horrible people they are.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.360
Mother is just pointing out that we, in this area,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:14.120
in the green area there, are ten gurus.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.440
Would you like to come on My feet and work it out better? All right?

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.640
Let's see it. Now put your both the hands, and the right [unclear].

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.000
Just like this. Now put down your head. And you can see

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.880
the Kundalini. If you want to see the Kundalini, you can see his.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.760
Bring your knees further forward and stretch them.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.280
Bring just your knees. Yes, that's it.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.880
As long as you're comfortable. Like, you  go back.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.960
Yes, it is there.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:41.080
Do you want to see it? It's...

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.960
Stretch the cloth down little bit.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.080
Now better?

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.040
[unclear] because it's here

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.040
but it also reflects here, that's called the Ekadesha Rudra.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.840
And once that goes out, then things like cancer also can settle.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.240
So it's extremely dangerous.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.160
I mean, you are vulnerable to such dieseases there.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.160
A vulnerable situation comes.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.880
Now just see, are you feeling any cool? Just see!

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.200
One hand towards Me. Just see yourself.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.200
Just turn around to raise the Kundalini.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.680
You raise it. - Like this, like this.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.600
Come on, bring it up.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:03.320
See, normally these gurus don't work at all.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.480
They take money from you, make you a.. and I have to get it cleared.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.160
Got up.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.200
More right it would be better.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.560
It has come up to heart now.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.440
It's coming.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.360
Like that.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.720
Still you fix his Vishuddhi.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.840
You are all right. All right?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.200
Feeling better now?

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.720
See, put your hands towards Me. - Hold your hands!

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.880
All right? Better? May God bless you!

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:13.600
I think he'll just put this right because sensitivity will increase.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.240
Come and sit here. Yes, just go that side.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.560
Are you all right? How are you feeling?

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.760
Isn't that his hands started to colour little more too, Mother?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.480
The other it started going a little.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.080
I think put his left hand on the Mother Earth.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.080
All right? Just like that. Press it on the Mother Earth.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.680
Tell him to put it on the Mother Earth.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.480
On the ground?

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.040
On the ground.[You are not cheated?] Now.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.240
No need to lock up...

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.480
Don't lock up your this thing, you see.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.080
He said, he feels it more comfortable.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.240
Is it? O.k.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.480
Better? Is he better now?

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.520
I can feel very little Mother.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.320
You didn't feel that much? All right! Come along, let's try!

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.080
Someone here to work on this lady?

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.800
Just this lady here. Now come along. I would like to work on you.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.480
It's better now?

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.680
Is it cooling down?

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.360
What he is saying?

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.120
You have pain in your back?

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.200
All the time?

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.720
- Always? - Sometimes I [unclear] sometime [unclear].

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.440
So most of the time, nearly all the time.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.560
Where about is it? This is the point?

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.000
It's in the heart, the heart area, there.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.520
Not down below? -Yes.-

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.000
And down below? Oh, both at the bottom hand...

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.680
Both at swadhistan and at atma.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.480
Very warm hand. Y: Physical sort of... Swadhisthan is felt.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.080
You just go on saying, "Mother, I'm my own guru".

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.760
Or "I'm my own master". All right?

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.360
You are your own master.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.720
"I am my own master".

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.920
You never felt anything yesterday? - No. - Nothing?

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.760
Just say that now in your heart. Just quietly in your heart you say.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:29.640
- Tu parles le francais? - No. I am own master.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.880
- I am my own master. - I am my own master.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.840
I am my own master.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.080
What work you do?

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.680
House work. House work.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.520
House work? Work very hard!

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.640
You are doing everything. Expert.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.800
So getting cool?

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.920
Is she hot?

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.760
Better?

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.840
O.k. Go back and you just sit on the ground

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.560
with that hand like this. Like same position.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.560
Any position that you want to take.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.160
Let him take another position. I think it will be better off.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.960
No, I mean, for the left hand to You and the right on the ground.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.640
Sitting down, you can sit the other way round.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.760
Sit more correctly. O.k., come with me.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.800
Whichever way you want to sit.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.240
Let him stand up up[wise].

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.080
Maybe if you stand. Stand like this.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:34.200
Better now? Is it cooler? Are you feeling?

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:40.120
Plan too much of housewife's job, do you?

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.400
I know all your keys, eh?

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.880
The mother has to know, isn't it?

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.280
All right? Is better now? See, it's a screw here.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.960
That gets loose if you plan too much.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:00.760
You have to fix up the screw.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.280
You try to plan too much. How can you plan?

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.640
You see, in a housewife's job I don't think you can plan,

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.480
but whatever is available in the market that's all you can cook.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.000
How can you plan before hand?

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.640
If you plan and if it is not there, then it's headache.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.600
All right? Better?

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.960
Are you feeling anything? Close your eyes!

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.040
Do you feel anything?

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.800
-Yes.-  Sahasrara.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.760
Better?

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.160
Now, are you feeling anything in the hand?

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.600
Let Me see. All right. Now, you forgive.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:25.040
Forgive everyone. Just forgive, your husband, everyone!

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.040
And yourself also. Try to forgive.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.280
Better still.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.760
[unclear-All the time it's getting cooler.]

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.480
Better.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.120
It's much cooler.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.760
Now put your left hand towards Me and right hand

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.600
on the Mother Earth, just touching touching the Mother Earth, there.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:02.440
All right. Better?

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.760
Are you feeling anything or not?

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.720
Nothing? Little bit?

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.480
Just don't think and forgive. Forgive. Forgive. Forgive.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.280
Forgive. Forgive. Forgive. Forgive.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.840
Just forgive. Forgive.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.920
Better? Feeling more? That means you are not forgiving, that's why

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.400
you are not feeling so much. Now go on forgiving. All right? Better.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.400
Sit down and say "I forgive everyone". Just sit down and say.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.600
May God bless you!

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.960
Now, you can come forward now. Let's see. You try on her.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.960
- You? - That's her husband, Mother.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.640
Oh, I see, your husband. Now, then you come. Now, let's...

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.760
Is he all right?

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.760
I don't think I'm very sensitive.

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.760
Not yet? Not feeling anything?

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.640
Sometimes I used to feel a burning sensation here.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.800
- It will work out. - Pardon?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.360
It will work out.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.320
Say more.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:27.000
What work you do? Housewife?

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:30.320
Unemployed.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.640
But you must be a housewife?

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.800
A clerk.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.960
Works in... clerical work, Mother.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.960
Warm. You've been to some gurus? Have you been?

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.000
- Yogiji. - Who's Yogiji?

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.640
In Dharamsala school.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.880
Yogi Mahajan.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.080
Yogi Mahajan?

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.080
Oh, I see!

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.760
He never corrected your Nabhi, yes?

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:08.440
All right. Come forward. And I have to correct your Nabhi.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.960
Is very hot! All right.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.080
Just come forward!  It's too much on the Nabhi.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.680
Just left hand.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.920
Is it possible? Can we remove this part?

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.960
Let her put her hand on the Mother Earth. Now it's all right.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.080
Now, what about these people?

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.920
I think I feel burning just here.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.560
Just here. All right! Can somebody help her?

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.240
Anybody coming down ?

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.360
Now, you see, the thing is we have...

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.960
Is it to be?... It doesn't relay, does it?

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.080
No, it doesn't, Mother, I'm afraid.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.280
We are now like travellers, come down here, you see,

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.400
with all our caravan. And we'll be going away...

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.360
But it would be good for you to start a centre in Perth, you see.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.640
-In  Adelaide. - I'm sorry, I mean Adelaide!

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.280
Perth was last couple of days ago.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.600
I've been talking too much.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.080
So in Adelaide. In Adelaide...

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.440
maybe that some people would like to come down here,

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.960
and take a place on hire, to begin with.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.920
And if some of you could join them also, to stay with them,

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.760
you can build up a nucleus to begin with.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.600
Then gradually, as you grow more, then you can establish your own

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.920
proper thing. To begin with, I think best thing would be

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.560
to take some place on hire

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.680
and some of them can come down here.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.680
And some of you who are alone can also stay there

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.520
and pay for your rents together, I don't want anything.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.440
All right? Look after yourselves

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.400
and also look after this place.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.440
This is what we are planning to do.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.720
But all those who belong to Adelaide should help this thing,

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.920
to work out. All right?

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:18.720
So, if you know of any place which is spacious enough,

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.320
please let us know and not so much rent, because

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:26.760
everybody doesn't have so much money.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.400
And also,

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.720
if some of you would like to stay with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.280
so that you can all learn,

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:39.560
there could be a regular place for you where you can go and meet.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.840
Because it's quite a lot to be learned and enjoyed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.440
Better?

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.360
I was just talking about

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.480
here in Adelaide we are trying to open a centre here

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.560
and if anybody has any ideas,

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:59.760
where there might be a large and appropriate house for renting,

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.760
then it would be a good idea to let us know.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.720
Better now? Is she? Are you feeling better?

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.880
He suffered from stomach?

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.360
-...to Adelaide here perhaps to help

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.720
from other centres to get it set up

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:20.400
and those people who might like to join and live with the,

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.360
for a time perhaps, with the Sahaja Yogis, join in,

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.680
paying rent, living with the other Sahaja Yogis

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.760
living with one another, starting to help

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.080
spread, starting to talk to other people

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:39.920
This is the way Sahaja Yoga has grown in other centres in Australia.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:44.040
And there's about, I suppose about

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.520
sixty people,

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:52.720
who live together in Sidney in various places,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.200
Sahaja Yogis who share a life together there.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.960
And same in Melbourne.

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:05.200
And now, it's now as we start a centre here,

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.080
so if anybody has any ideas

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.520
where this might be established, this might be got please let us know.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.320
Do you feel better?

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.320
Is she better now? Feeling the cool breeze?

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.720
...getting to know what Sahaja Yoga is all about

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.440
and going to know each other.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.080
Now, how are you? Gets trouble.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.000
I've got schizophrenia.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.640
And how?

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.280
I'm on medication.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.080
What schizophrenia? You don't have any. Who told you that?

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.880
Doctor.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.480
What do you do for that?

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.960
In what way?

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.880
What is the symptom you have?

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:52.760
Feeling [to my hands these days] sort of powers, [unclear] powers.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.840
Powers? What powers?

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.680
-Devils' powers.-  Really?

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:05.400
Not anymore, because of medication it's got really better.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.800
Powers of the devils?

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.400
Yes.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.080
In my left side. In my left side.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.440
Up and down in my left side.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.760
And now in hands [unclear] responsible to...

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.720
So they used to overpower you.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.880
Or you used to become violent?

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.480
I don't know what I [unclear] a violent, terrible, aggressive mood.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:30.320
She is still violent, she gives me this black eye.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.200
And you don't know what you are doing?

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.880
I don't know. I just now, I need to be cured, that's all.

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.240
Now where did you? Did you go to any guru or anyone?

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:43.720
I've taken drugs. LSD, and now I'm [unclear].

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.640
And what else?

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.400
You went to some guru?

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.920
Yes. A psychic healer,

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:59.520
he said I had [gangalinie] I had snakes above my head [unclear].

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.560
Now, but any other Indian guru you have been to?

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.480
No.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.800
How did you sleep last night?

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.680
Not very well. I woke up few times, very tensed.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.680
Feels tensed.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.320
No, let her sit down there.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:23.480
Put her left hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.080
All right?

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.000
That left side towards Me.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.080
Now yesterday they told Me that

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.280
some Lang gentleman has written a book

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.200
that you have to become schizophrenic

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.440
to become a higher personality.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.960
It's absurd, absolutely absurd.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:50.960
I don't know. This fellow is the same I hope of that Dr. Lang.

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.600
Is it the same of the...

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.160
R D Lang.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.160
[unclear] From London?

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.400
Horrible fellow!

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.160
You read him, is it? Did you read him?

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.000
Yea, I did. I thought enlightenment means skizophrenia.

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.960
She thought it was enlightenment to be a skizophrenic.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.960
Put your left hand. It's absurd.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.680
You see, these are all demons, I tell you.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.600
These ideas they give to ruin all human beings and all the seekers.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.680
-Because they sound so plausible, Mother.- How?

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.960
Sometimes they sound so plausible.

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:39.400
But how? Then use your brains! God will make you mad?

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:43.520
Before giving you the highest?

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.080
I tell you how what must have happened. St. Paul,

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.600
he's responsible.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.960
Who is, Mother?

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.880
The St. Paul in the Bible, you read. Yes is this horrible gentleman.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:05.600
He was... I don't know how he is there in the Bible.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.480
First of all, because he is the one

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.880
who was just killing all the Christians,

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.840
he was doing all kind of things, suddenly he saw a cross.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.840
According to Sahaja Yoga it's a supraconscious activity.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.560
Supraconscious.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.480
And in this supraconscious activity you see, you start seeing cross,

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.760
you can see even Christ, you can see anything.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.760
Seeing is not the point. Becoming is the point, you see?

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:33.600
And then suddenly he took over to organize Christianity.

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.640
And then the way he organized, were all absolutely devilish.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.640
Because what he said, he wrote these acts, acts,

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.360
about the disciples of Christ.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.080
He had never met them, he had never seen them. On his own he wrote,

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.080
saying that they became mad

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.600
and the Holy Ghost came into them, they were talking like mad

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.160
and all those things and..

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.680
Mother, I went to an... what they call...

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.640
Speaking in tongues.

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.160
Charismatic.

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:07.160
Charismatic? - Yes, I went to that way.-

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.880
That's what they are doing. I mean,

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:13.680
they don't use their brains you see.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:17.160
Excuse me, Mother. What is this they are "speaking in tongues"?

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.560
So then, what happened, that this gentleman

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.200
wrote there the Acts. Is one of the chapters in Bible,

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.280
in which he described these people,

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.760
the disciples of Christ getting Holy Ghost into them.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.800
Holy Ghost making them mad.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.160
And they were talking all kinds of languages,

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:39.280
talking all sorts of things

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:43.280
and that is how the Holy Ghost came in. Imagine.

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.520
Is this the way She is going to come? That She makes you mad?

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:51.560
And how can it be? Who wants such a Holy Ghost?

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.720
You must understand, it is God,

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.480
who is kind, who is gentle, who is our benefactor.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.080
He's beneficent. How can He make us mad?

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.600
And all the christians believe that part of Bible.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.520
Is all wrong, absolutely!

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.520
You must have seen, when people get posessed,

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.960
they start talking all kinds of languages.

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:26.960
Even, you must have seen a film on this artist...

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.560
What was it?  Van Gogh, Van Gogh!

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.480
The one who became mad and died. Van Gogh.

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.840
They showed Van Gogh coming into some person

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:39.760
and drawing the whole thing just like him,

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.600
and also painting the same way, the way... You know Van Gogh's

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.640
paintings are. There's very strong lines of different colours.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.400
Same style he did, in a free hand he did it.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.400
And he said that "Van Gogh has come into my body."

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.000
So, this is not what you have to get from God.

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.880
It's something so great and so important!

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.120
Not these cheap things, like talking in another language...

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.960
Now take out your rings, all right? Please. Take out all of them.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.960
It's not proper to wear rings too many.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.280
That's what my mum says.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.720
Your mum gave it. All right.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.840
You put them in the water for the time being. All right?

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.840
Take out all of them. Take out.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:40.160
Oh, better, he's all right! Are you all right?

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.440
It should be logical, you know? Everything. This particular....

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.560
-It's wedding ring.-  Wedding it's all right.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.960
Put your right hand like this.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.040
Do their drunkenness....

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.560
I beg your pardon?

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.680
Drunkenness, Mother, he's asking about.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.680
It is absolutely cleared out, in no time.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.960
Like drugs.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.760
You bring some water for Me, today? Bring water.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.520
I'll vibrate it. You take that. Put it in your alcohols.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.400
Whenever you feel like drinking, you see, just think of Me.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.400
Mother, Australian society expects the male

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.160
to go out and drink with the boys fifteen pints every day

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.040
and is part of being a man in Australian culture.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.640
That's the image that they expect of a man.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.320
And because he doesn't do it, he thinks for that, you know,

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.960
"Am I a gay or am I a poof, or something like that?"

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.920
Because he doesn't do that, you know?

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.840
Because he doesn't go out drinking.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.440
You see what happens, that...- He has to drink every day.-

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.160
No, but after Realization, means now you have your second birth,

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.560
So you are not born in Australia, you are born

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.440
in the Kingdom of God.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.800
All right? So you are no more an Australian, you are a yogi.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.120
The whole thing that you get out of your birth is finished now.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.920
No more, you are a Yogi!

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.200
All over the world there are so many like that. They are all Yogis!

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:22.160
So these images may be for people who are not reborn.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.400
But people who are reborn, are born in the Kingdom of God.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.120
They are governed by the God's wishes

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.120
and God's laws, all right?

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.280
Take out your rings also, please.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.400
Is he better?

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.200
Not feeling anything? Did you feel before?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.760
Now put your left hand on the liver.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.360
All right? Better now?

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.400
Where is he catching?

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:17.520
Left Vishuddhi. I have a left Vishuddhi and little bit Swadhisthan.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.120
As a punishment for feeling guilty!

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.440
Keep your eyes open here.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.480
This is a punishment for feeling guilty, all right?

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.400
Better. What's it?

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.160
It stopped shaking.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.040
Put your right on the Mother Earth.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.560
Let her put her right on the Mother Earth.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.040
Right on the Mother Earth.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:49.280
And hold this hand up to Mother.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:54.160
Better? All right? This punishment helps!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.040
Better now? Not yet?

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.480
Still on the heart. All right.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.960
Better ask the question of Holy Ghost.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.640
"Are you the Holy Ghost?"

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.720
Cold.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.520
Yes, I feel there cool.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.360
That's the answer. All right? Good!

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.600
Now let him also ask the same question.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.960
"Mother, are You the Holy Ghost?" SM: Again!

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.400
"Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.480
"Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:04.120
"Mother are you the Holy Ghost?" I feel cool!

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:08.080
Cool means truth, right?

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.520
Good. Same, you too ask the question.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.800
"Mother, are You the Holy Ghost? Mother, are You the Holy Ghost?"

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.720
"Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.800
All right?

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.200
It's better!

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.640
All right?

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.760
All right now? Nothing? All right, we have to see you.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.360
Good! Forget about everything now!

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.760
Past is past, finished!

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.560
You are a new born person. May God bless you! Better now?

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.880
Thank you, Mother!

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.720
May God bless you! Now you have to progress further

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.520
and give up all your drugs and everything, after some time.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.280
You will be perfectly all right. Good.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.320
Tie it up yourself there, on top.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.720
Tie it up and knot it.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.320
We'll do it again.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.960
Twice.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.960
Bandhans Mother, as well?

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.600
Good. We'll tell him. Now.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.160
Let us see two other people.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.880
-This lady.- This gentleman also, we should see.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080
Still here. Come along forward little bit.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.840
You come along, here. Come forward little bit.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.760
Come forward [unclear].

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.600
I remember.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:55.560
After lifting the energy, after lifting the Kundalini

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.280
like this, you start feeling [unclear].

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:07.680
And there is the bandhan, which is [unclear].

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.760
Better? Still here.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.760
Very tough.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.280
Around you is like a protective shield.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.800
Seven. Seven is a good auspicious number.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.040
Herbert?

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.680
Can you, can you light this for Me, please?

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.280
Bandhan is very useful, any time, any time you need.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.560
So, how did you feel? - Cooler.-

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:43.920
Cooler, yes,(-Cool breeze-),  all right, let's see.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.560
What about this lady?

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.520
Is she Australian?

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.720
Also half Indian?

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.600
No Mother, half Mediteranean, not Australian.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.280
Half-Mediteranean, Mother. Egypt.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.800
Egyptian. Egypt? Egypt is very good.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.240
So.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.440
Good? Better?

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.720
You have a liver problem, sir. A very bad one. Sure?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.800
You have. All right.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.040
Now you sit down there and put your right hand towards Me

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.240
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.240
You too! You have a bad liver. Do you know that?

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.320
All right. You put your right hand towards Me

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.480
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.640
Right hand towards Me, like this

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.480
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.320
He's all right. Y:Just put your two hands towards Mother.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.400
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.760
A little cooler.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.640
Little cooler.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.640
Close your eyes! Let's see.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.200
Still shaking, Mother.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.320
The Hamsa.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.320
Better?

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:41.760
You put your left hand on the earth and right hand towards Me.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.880
Have you sun tanned yourself or what?

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.480
You don't do that, not good!

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.320
Very bad for your liver, very bad for your skin.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.160
And in the long run it's very, very bad.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.960
It can create very serious problem. All right? There's no need!

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.960
You look nice without it, isn't it?

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.040
I'm surprised, that they talk of racialism

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.440
and they don't like people who are black.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.640
And here they are making themselves black.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.560
How do you explain this? Isn't it absurd?

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:31.600
It is very absurd this discrimination against black people.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.040
Everybody trying to be black, then, why?

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.560
Either you have this or that.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.720
Don't think about too much. Just, just feel it, just.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.960
It's a little bit warm there, that's what he's saying,

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.960
it's a little bit warm there but it's cool there.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.840
So if you feel the difference, means [unclear].

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.080
Is she that tensed?

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.640
Is it not all right? I think he is all right. This one is all right.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.720
Better now?

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.240
[unclear]

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.040
How is she?

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.440
I think she is all right. She's all right. You look after her.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.040
It's better. Now you sit down. Now better?

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:29.640
This gentleman, left to the right, just put it.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.840
Are you better now? Sit down properly.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.560
Sit down. The same way as you have been sitting. How is she?

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.200
I'm just anxious.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.320
And yesterday you felt the cool breeze?

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.960
I was feeling a lot of heat in the hands.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.680
A lot of heat in the right hand and

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.720
a bit of shaking on the right, Mother.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.640
Now put your left hand on the [Mother Earth]. Yes, outside, yes.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.200
What work do you do?

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.040
Teacher.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.520
Better ask the question.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.720
She's a teacher.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.760
"Mother, are You the teacher of the teachers?"

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.680
Just ask the question, "Are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.440
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.120
Put your hand there, on the Mother Earth. It's important.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.600
Ask the question?

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.960
"Are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.200
Again. "Mother...

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.840
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.040
"Are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.800
Getting?

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.400
This is [unclear] impossible, Mother.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.960
Is there? Now ask ten times, so that it's clearer.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.920
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.520
"Mother, are You the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.000
All right? That's the answer.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.680
Ask. It's all right. It's done, it's flowing.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.280
Close your eyes!

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.960
Forgive. Forgive all the students, first of all.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.280
That's what I'm caring for.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.640
Just forgive them! They are good.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.080
I have a knot in my stomach yet.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.640
Yes, I know. They can be horrible nuisance.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.320
Now you see, because parents don't look after their children,

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.200
no training, no discipline,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.400
they just know how to laugh and mock at the teachers.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:25.920
Not in India. In India is not so. But otherwise...

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.760
- Thank you! - May God bless you!

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.440
Now you know how important is this work, you see?

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.920
We have to also transform the children,

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.800
so they become good, happy children, secured,

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.320
feeling the love of God. See, they will improve a lot.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.520
All right? May God bless you!

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:55.200
This lady, how is she?

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.400
Just see! Come along!

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.880
This one is all right? He's good!

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:05.280
He's really good. You didn't go to any guru, anyone?

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:09.280
No, not really, no. I've done some reading.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.400
SM: Reading only. Y: No, not seeing, not visiting any ashrams.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.400
Thank God.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.400
Otherwise I have to clear everyone...

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.280
Now, you've been to someone?

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.120
He's been to Yogi Mahajan too.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:33.400
Yes? And who else? - Nobody else is.-

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.080
Only Yogi Mahajan?! Yogi Mahajan is giving Me problem.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.840
He did all kinds of things, Yogi, to begin with. Now, you can...

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.440
He did all kinds of other things. When did you go to Yogi Mahajan?

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.960
Before or after he got his Realization?

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.680
When did you go to him?

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.920
About two years ago, Mother.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:03.200
Did he talk of Sahaja Yoga at that time?

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.040
Background is Egyptian.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.160
Background is Egyptian, Mother. About half and half.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.640
How is it?

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:34.440
Now which guru you have been to? Somebody, did you go?  No one.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.120
The Egyptians believe in the mummies and all that.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:43.600
I'm Jewish by religion, Jewish.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.800
That's it!

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.320
For Jews you have to ask one question, all right, if you don't mind.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.240
Say "Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.120
Touché.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.840
All right, just ask Me! In asking there is no harm!

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.480
All right? If I am the truth you will know it.

01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.760
All right? Let's have it's answer.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.120
"Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.280
All right, just put it up. Again!

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:38.000
"Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.280
"Mother, was Christ the son of God?"

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.480
All right. Got it.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.200
All right? Feeling the cool in the hands?

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.640
I say what does it matter.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:54.840
Is it coming in the hand?

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.960
I don't know what I'm supposed to feel.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:06.680
Are you feeling cool breeze in the hands?

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.440
No, I'm feeling a concentration of heat

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.440
in the centre of both the palms.

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.960
Very sharp concentration.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.960
You have to believe in Christ. He was!

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.120
You can't help it! You can't deny the truth. He was!

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.600
See, Jews said, didn't deny him because they believed

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.040
that "we must suffer", alright?

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.280
So they did suffer. Now at least, believe in Him!

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.280
I believe in suffering.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.320
Still? Then you'll have another Hitler.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.400
You want another Hitler to come in?

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.040
I think every Jew is his own Hitler.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:59.360
That's it. So what? Don't be against yourself.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:03.320
God has made you to be happy, not to suffer.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.680
Wrong ideas about God. Absolutely wrong ideas.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:12.480
It's very, very wrong ideas you have. How can God make you suffer?

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.760
I don't know how these ideas came to you.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.680
It's like it's burning! [unclear].

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.720
Now you want to suffer, so the burning is there.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.760
Now just say: "I don't want to suffer Mother, anymore!"

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.760
I don't want to suffer anymore.

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.240
Again, Say that.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.040
"I don't want to suffer anymore."

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.200
"Mother, I don't want to suffer anymore."

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.600
"Mother, I don't want to suffer anymore."

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.240
Better, you see? Is cooler now?

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.560
Better?

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.400
This one is very, very hot.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.920
Just see. You can see clear, the truth, before yourself.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:18.520
See, that you should feel such heat.

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.960
This is anti-God activity to ask for suffering.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.960
Supposing you have a mother or you are a mother

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.480
and if your child says: "Oh, I want to suffer."

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.400
It's too much for a mother to see the child suffering.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:39.040
Greater suffering than the child has.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:44.120
It's some sort of a sadism, I think, to torture God.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.120
Isn't it? Why should you suffer?

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.880
It's absurd! God will never like you to suffer.

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:58.360
Why will He? He was not created you on this earth to suffer.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.800
Did you suffer to become human beings?

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.720
No, I did not, at all. Then why should you suffer now?

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.080
It's all mental activity.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.920
Something you must find out to hit yourself, isn't it?

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.800
All right. Better.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.200
Have faith in yourself.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.240
The whole of Bible, if you read,

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.000
I don't find anywhere written, that you must suffer.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.840
You feel like cool in hand now?

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.760
Oh, it's there.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.640
What about the Son?

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:43.160
"Thou art my shepherd." That's in the Bible.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.600
"The Lord is my shepherd."

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.760
That's in the Tora. Then how?

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.560
What did David say?

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.440
Did he say "I want to suffer"?

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.800
From where did these Jews get this idea?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.560
It's very bad! Makes God suffer much more.

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.280
All right?

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.560
-It's quite a lot of Vishuddhi here, Mother.-  Too much.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.920
- Especially on the left.-

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.560
Now don't feel guilty, for asking for suffering.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.720
Now don't feel guilty.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.520
All right. How are you? Are you also a Jew?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.520
[unclear]

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:33.480
Now, we have many Jews who are yogis, you see?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.520
We have many Jews who are yogis.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.800
They've lost all that.

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.680
And then what happened later on, see, they suffered.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.560
But the suffering did not transform the Jews. Just see that!

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.960
If after all that exodus and all those problems they had

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.400
they became more cruel people.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.040
How they behave now? Recently you saw them? Where they killed.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.920
There's no transformation. This suffering has given them

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.880
a condition which is very volatile and extremely violent.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.920
And the reaction.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.400
Instead of making them peaceful people,

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.880
kind people, compassionate people, isn't it?

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.960
How they behaved?

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.440
There's no transformation through this suffering.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.920
On the contrary, it's very dangerous to suffer.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.560
Those who suffer become reactionaries.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.880
And bitter.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.560
Ah, better. - It's good!-

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.560
Come forward! Now, are you a Jew?

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.080
So what are you? - Nothing. - Nothing.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.080
How do you all get these claws? - Because of the machines.-

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:21.400
Now, better.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.120
Close your eyes!

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.400
10% in this country, Mother.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.200
And rising, somebody says.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.120
Your forefathers have worked for you. This kind for you I think.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.880
How is she?

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.440
There's a little Nabhi, it shows.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:01.200
Little yellow on the hands as well.

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.840
What work you do? - I'm a teacher.-

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:14.480
Let her put left hand on her stomach. Ask her.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.480
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?" Yes?

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.320
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?"

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.400
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?"

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.520
Say it again! Say, ten times you have to say!

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:45.040
"Mother, are you the teacher of the teachers?"

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.080
All right?

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.960
Better. Do you [unclear]?

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.520
Little in the hand?

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.400
To the right? Twice try it.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:17.400
Put your left hand.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.600
It's all right? Forgive, just forgive.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.960
Warren? Just see this gentleman!
