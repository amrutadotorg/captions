03:12.138 --> 03:19.138
It’s very nice to see all of you here, so
many of you from Australia,

03:21.453 --> 03:24.077
to worship Shiva, Sadashiva.

03:25.866 --> 03:29.253
I think this is a very important occasion.

03:39.588 --> 03:45.926
Is important, because Sadashiva,

03:47.706 --> 03:51.232
the God Almighty, who is One,

03:52.786 --> 03:57.544
is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Shiva.

04:03.889 --> 04:15.253
We have to understand that so many people
came on this earth at different times, in

04:15.562 --> 04:26.798
different countries, and they talked to different
people about righteousness, that is dharma,

04:30.011 --> 04:32.811
about how to elevate yourself,

04:33.650 --> 04:38.219
and all of them have said that you have to be reborn,

04:40.965 --> 04:44.030
that is, you have to become the Spirit.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.912
They have all

04:54.682 --> 04:58.741
said the same thing because they knew, without

05:02.094 --> 05:09.610
the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

05:10.926 --> 05:14.956
you will not be able to understand spirituality.

05:31.408 --> 05:33.608
You have the Spirit within you,

05:35.007 --> 05:38.624
which is all the time in a witness state.

05:40.171 --> 05:42.700
Why all the religions have failed?

05:43.517 --> 05:48.131
Because they did not get their Self-Realization.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.244
They did not become the Spirit.

05:55.566 --> 06:00.390
So there's a tremendous difference between you and all others

06:00.565 --> 06:04.856
who profess something. It looks as if they are hypocrites.

06:06.313 --> 06:12.136
They intellectualize it as you know, they explain it very well,

06:13.397 --> 06:18.488
but you can see very clearly
that they haven't absorbed spirituality.

06:21.734 --> 06:27.855
That absorption was impossible without Self-Realization.

06:30.237 --> 06:32.459
This everybody felt.

06:33.046 --> 06:37.445
Buddha went to this limit and Mahavira both, to say that,

06:37.694 --> 06:39.871
forget about God,

06:40.200 --> 06:42.476
forget about God Almighty,

06:43.622 --> 06:47.113
you just get your Self, your Self-Realization.

06:48.254 --> 06:51.235
So they are called as atheist in Idikshavadi,

06:51.385 --> 06:53.675
they don't believe in Ishwara,

06:54.785 --> 07:00.281
but they felt that the way
people are just talking about God Almighty

07:00.483 --> 07:03.126
and what the books have said.

07:04.214 --> 07:10.373
These books also speak of righteousness,

07:10.645 --> 07:15.860
except in some books there has been some sort of interference,

07:16.324 --> 07:21.354
but most of them speak of spirituality

07:21.751 --> 07:24.484
and what you have to achieve,

07:25.598 --> 07:29.211
what is the purpose of religion.

07:33.728 --> 07:38.960
All that is spoken very well, written very well.

07:40.252 --> 07:44.113
They'll tell you, “You have to be this, you have to be that,

07:44.382 --> 07:47.126
this is not good, that is not good.”

07:47.681 --> 07:52.549
So even the first state, where the dharma has to be established,

07:53.131 --> 08:01.736
was not established:
where people are not supposed to cheat each other,

08:03.024 --> 08:08.781
there has to be justice, there has to be collectivity,

08:10.017 --> 08:16.235
there has to be love and understanding, no jealousies,

08:16.951 --> 08:23.951
no hypocrisy; where it's a different race,

08:24.115 --> 08:25.648
a different community,

08:25.961 --> 08:30.198
we can call it a different civilization is to be created.

08:32.172 --> 08:35.838
Everybody claims that they are the chosen ones,

08:36.543 --> 08:38.847
but they are just the same.

08:39.982 --> 08:44.752
There's a tremendous achievement of Sahaja Yogis

08:45.352 --> 08:48.932
that they have achieved this state of Spirit.

08:49.816 --> 08:54.442
So now you can absorb dharma without any difficulties,

08:54.782 --> 08:59.802
without any difficulties. You would not like to cheat anyone,

09:00.188 --> 09:02.188
you'd not like to kill anyone,

09:02.615 --> 09:05.776
you'd not like to be violent with anyone.

09:06.377 --> 09:10.889
You will stick on to the truth, the truth,

09:11.427 --> 09:14.905
very few people can stick on to the truth.

09:17.184 --> 09:22.317
Then you are not people who are going to rob others,

09:23.666 --> 09:29.753
you have no intention at all, doesn't come into your mind

09:30.003 --> 09:33.991
that you are tempted to take away things from others.

09:36.776 --> 09:40.254
First of all, which is the most important thing,

09:40.437 --> 09:44.462
that you have a rapport with God Almighty;

09:46.945 --> 09:52.350
that you are, in a way, in awe about God.

09:53.194 --> 09:57.987
There is awe, not I would say fear,

09:58.407 --> 10:02.363
because fear is all dispelled, there's no more fear for you,

10:04.177 --> 10:08.729
but you have awe for God, that He is God Almighty.

10:10.710 --> 10:16.795
You won't cheat people, you won't cheat Sahaja Yoga for money,

10:18.236 --> 10:28.800
you won't fight for power or for something that is material.

10:30.558 --> 10:33.526
All your attention will be towards

10:33.924 --> 10:38.547
the expansion of your awareness in the light of the Spirit.

10:39.372 --> 10:42.912
This is the vision of your Mother,

10:44.012 --> 10:47.412
because Shiva is just a witness,

10:47.832 --> 10:50.993
Sadashiva is just witnessing all this play.

10:51.333 --> 10:55.200
He doesn't have any visions about it,

10:55.411 --> 10:59.104
but now He must have lots of hopes after seeing

10:59.864 --> 11:03.864
the kind of people that are created out of Sahaja Yoga.

11:04.416 --> 11:10.661
Very unique, very beautiful,
wonderful angel-like people have been created.

11:11.656 --> 11:17.776
Now only problem is that
you have to keep to your angelic foundations;

11:19.080 --> 11:24.395
but I find that sometimes it happens, doesn't matter,

11:25.262 --> 11:28.171
that you fall, and falter.

11:29.067 --> 11:38.078
Again, you rise into your awareness and try to locate

11:43.215 --> 11:49.932
the new dimensions that are available to you,
that you can find out.

11:51.363 --> 11:58.363
All this is possible because now
you belong really to the chosen ones’ race.

11:58.993 --> 12:03.162
You must know also that you are very special people.

12:03.899 --> 12:07.459
It is not realized sometimes by Sahaja Yogis.

12:09.038 --> 12:13.400
They have no self-esteem as to what they have got.

12:15.113 --> 12:17.482
Once you have self-esteem,

12:17.871 --> 12:24.871
you will have the wisdom to understand
what is your role in this lifetime.

12:28.692 --> 12:31.599
This self-esteem is only possible

12:31.872 --> 12:38.751
if you see other people who are lost in the mire of nonsense.

12:40.872 --> 12:43.863
Now you are a special community I said,

12:44.045 --> 12:50.325
you are the one who are going to create that great community.

12:55.220 --> 13:02.914
Now whatever are the dharma’s

13:05.114 --> 13:09.431
points, or we can say dharma’s aspects,

13:10.396 --> 13:16.357
you can imbibe them Sahaj. “Sahaj” has a very special meaning:

13:16.517 --> 13:20.133
Spontaneously, you do not have to exert,

13:21.616 --> 13:28.616
you do not have to go into a penance or work it out.

13:30.231 --> 13:35.602
In a Sahaj way you can do it. “Sahaj” also means easy.

13:36.578 --> 13:40.690
You can have it in your heart, all these qualities,

13:40.953 --> 13:43.785
without any difficulty whatsoever.

13:44.828 --> 13:50.902
It's the easiest thing for you
to be righteous than to be otherwise.

13:51.379 --> 13:55.741
It's easier for you to be honest than to be otherwise.

13:57.198 --> 14:06.980
So this speciality that you have got
is the vision of all the saints, of all the prophets,

14:07.215 --> 14:12.693
of all the seers, of all the Incarnations,

14:15.721 --> 14:20.154
There are lectures and lectures people give,
“You must do like this, you must do that way.”

14:21.254 --> 14:27.441
They think that by educating people into
these principles people will be all right, they cannot.

14:29.625 --> 14:34.282
If you try to educate them, it will go as an ego into their heads,

14:34.452 --> 14:38.357
because you get educated only through your ego.

14:39.575 --> 14:45.244
Is not Sahaj, is not Sahaj sustenance, Sahaja dharana,

14:45.426 --> 14:49.970
it is something that is put

14:50.238 --> 14:52.367
onto you from outside,

14:53.580 --> 15:00.584
but for you it is very easy, that you can imbibe

15:00.995 --> 15:04.553
all the aspects of dharma very easily.

15:04.859 --> 15:07.865
You don't have to do anything, you will not just do it.

15:08.273 --> 15:11.814
I've known people who used to take drugs,

15:12.540 --> 15:18.410
who used to abuse people, beat. There's one fellow,
he said he used to carry a revolver always with him.

15:18.671 --> 15:23.782
He's become such a quiet, silent, beautiful person

15:24.133 --> 15:28.691
that unbelievable, but his wife tells Me that he was like this.

15:29.138 --> 15:32.091
So now you are that special people,

15:32.942 --> 15:38.622
and those people who have not got their Realization

15:40.307 --> 15:43.405
cannot get to dharma easily.

15:46.399 --> 15:52.156
Then the second point which is very easy for you

15:52.802 --> 15:59.802
is to love another person, to care for another person.

16:02.256 --> 16:05.862
Is very easy, you would love to do that.

16:07.532 --> 16:14.987
You would love to care for people who are Sahaja Yogis,

16:15.770 --> 16:18.241
also who are non-SahajaYogis.

16:18.648 --> 16:20.941
Sahaja Yoga is quite flexible.

16:21.383 --> 16:25.609
If you see somebody who is a non-SahajaYogi

16:26.056 --> 16:30.225
and also suffering, you would immediately jump

16:31.972 --> 16:35.926
to see that that person gets help from you.

16:36.873 --> 16:42.120
I have seen people in Sahaja Yoga, very interesting they are.

16:44.853 --> 16:51.290
One gentleman came to Me and said,
“Mother I have no money, I want to go

16:52.314 --> 16:55.005
and do some work for Sahaja Yoga

16:55.136 --> 16:59.487
but I have no money, even I have no money for the household.”

16:59.646 --> 17:04.317
I said, “All right, that's very good, you come tomorrow,
I'll give you the money.”

17:04.839 --> 17:09.145
Next day he never came. I said, “What's the matter?”

17:10.530 --> 17:15.256
He said, “There was somebody
sitting with You that time when I was talking with You,

17:15.383 --> 17:18.551
if You remember.”
I said, “I don't remember so clearly.”

17:18.694 --> 17:21.242
“All right, I also don't know him,

17:21.390 --> 17:25.366
as soon as I went out he said, ‘How much money do you want?’

17:25.507 --> 17:27.543
I told him, ‘At least this much.’

17:27.690 --> 17:31.160
Immediately he took out the money and gave it to me.”

17:31.378 --> 17:36.641
So who haven't got something in Sahaja Yoga, who hasn't got money,

17:37.429 --> 17:40.544
immediately we run to help that person.

17:40.794 --> 17:45.973
Like you'll be amazed that there are these six countries like

17:46.093 --> 17:51.884
Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Poland,

17:56.091 --> 18:07.798
Czechoslovakia, all these countries, even Hungary, have been helped

18:09.505 --> 18:12.157
by one country or other,

18:13.234 --> 18:16.968
even the East Asian countries are helped by Australians.

18:17.358 --> 18:20.303
I never told them, I never asked them,

18:20.598 --> 18:23.032
I never said that, “You have to help.”

18:23.182 --> 18:27.557
They just came forward that
“Mother, somehow we have to help them,

18:27.886 --> 18:34.164
we'll arrange, we'll get to them,
we'll manage this, we'll do that.” It's very surprising,

18:34.868 --> 18:40.715
how they could just think of helping those countries.

18:41.782 --> 18:46.657
Then they made tickets for them,

18:47.142 --> 18:50.586
they brought them to India. They looked after,

18:50.780 --> 18:54.679
Russians came to India, were looked after.

18:54.936 --> 18:57.915
Everybody was so full of compassion and love

18:58.040 --> 19:00.704
but without feeling they have done anything, without feeling

19:00.840 --> 19:03.864
in any way that they have done any obligation to someone.

19:04.021 --> 19:09.109
Nobody expected them to thank them
and write letters of thanks or anything.

19:10.527 --> 19:13.394
Whatever is done is finished now, that's...

19:14.711 --> 19:19.697
Nobody ever asked how much money was given,

19:19.865 --> 19:24.352
how much was spent, how much we had to give, nothing of the kind.

19:24.590 --> 19:28.581
At that spur of the moment everybody
come forward, they gave the money

19:28.745 --> 19:32.631
and the thing worked out. It was very surprising.

19:35.296 --> 19:39.522
For example France, France is looking after Romania.

19:40.002 --> 19:43.587
I didn't know they had done so much of work in Romania.

19:43.726 --> 19:49.698
I reached Hungary and suddenly
I find hundred-and-twenty-five Romanians there.

19:49.891 --> 19:54.335
My heart was really filled with such joy.
I said, “How are you here?”

19:54.487 --> 19:59.065
“French have arranged everything for us, Mother.”
“Really?”

19:59.356 --> 20:03.147
There were no French people there, no-one from France.

20:03.295 --> 20:06.085
And Romanians were singing so well

20:06.362 --> 20:10.438
that the Indians felt that,
“Oh wah, what is this, a new group has started?”

20:10.553 --> 20:13.479
All of them, and they never used books, without

20:13.593 --> 20:16.178
using the books they were singing, these Romanians.

20:16.313 --> 20:18.852
So I said, “Where are you going to stay in the night?”

20:18.988 --> 20:21.256
“We'll stay in a garden Mother, it's all right.”

20:21.362 --> 20:25.428
But I said, “How?” “We'll stay there, doesn't matter.”

20:25.836 --> 20:27.897
How secretly they helped.

20:28.022 --> 20:33.419
If I had not asked them, I would not have known how they have come.

20:34.986 --> 20:38.107
So this, to help the people who do not have,

20:38.221 --> 20:42.132
you can call them sort of a,
you can say those who are poorer than us.

20:45.294 --> 20:52.485
I have seen also people, how individually they look after others,

20:54.272 --> 21:00.204
and bring things for their friends, presents

21:02.676 --> 21:07.293
and beautiful things, just for their own satisfaction,

21:08.181 --> 21:10.857
not to oblige anyone or to

21:11.245 --> 21:14.156
later on say, “Oh I brought this sari for you.” Nothing,

21:14.305 --> 21:17.371
just to see that sari on another Sahaja Yogi.

21:19.513 --> 21:21.582
It's such a beautiful thing.

21:22.296 --> 21:27.149
Imagine these countries like England, France, Spain,

21:30.452 --> 21:36.695
Italy, Switzerland, very aggressive, very aggressive people.

21:37.368 --> 21:40.589
When they went out, not to help anyone

21:41.417 --> 21:44.047
but to establish their empire

21:44.668 --> 21:51.668
or to destroy people, or to convert them or do
all kinds of things in the name of religion, in the name of God.

21:53.291 --> 21:57.636
But, when you go to other countries, you just want to help,

21:59.189 --> 22:02.021
give them all the help that is needed.

22:02.415 --> 22:07.778
I am Myself amazed how it works out so spontaneous in your heart

22:07.896 --> 22:11.642
that you should do this and you should work it out.

22:15.825 --> 22:19.659
This transformation that has taken place within you

22:19.981 --> 22:25.853
has brought out all the beauty of your heart,
of your compassion, of your love.

22:26.243 --> 22:29.265
And you give, want to give security to others,

22:29.448 --> 22:33.688
without expecting anything, without demanding anything.

22:34.573 --> 22:37.121
And you all enjoy it, doing that,

22:38.369 --> 22:40.702
living in a simple place like this,

22:41.606 --> 22:45.236
under a tent, sitting, listening to Me,

22:45.702 --> 22:51.552
you don't want any comfort, just seek the comfort of your Spirit

22:51.876 --> 22:55.035
and enjoy the whole place, the Nature.

22:56.328 --> 23:00.226
Gradually I have seen also Sahaja Yogis are becoming

23:00.523 --> 23:05.838
extremely conscious of the ecological problem all over the world.

23:08.023 --> 23:11.822
They have started using things which are natural,

23:11.958 --> 23:16.214
which are artistic. It's something so surprising

23:16.390 --> 23:20.032
that suddenly they have taken to artistic things.

23:21.019 --> 23:22.917
I know of a gentleman

23:25.459 --> 23:30.048
who had arms, ammunitions in his house, everything like that,

23:31.012 --> 23:34.062
but now he has beautiful things.

23:35.154 --> 23:38.689
Of course the arms and ammunition are on one side

23:38.791 --> 23:42.325
but such beautiful artistic things he has collected.

23:42.872 --> 23:45.278
So I said, “How did you get this?”

23:45.430 --> 23:47.139
He said, “Mother I was thinking

23:47.242 --> 23:49.881
that You would like to see them and You'll feel happy,

23:49.972 --> 23:52.659
so I have bought for You to see,

23:52.918 --> 23:56.990
and if You want You can take anything.”
I said, “I don't want anything,

23:57.104 --> 23:59.037
you can keep it to yourself.”

24:00.161 --> 24:03.631
So this generosity, we’ll call it adhari,

24:04.969 --> 24:07.121
is a sign of an Incarnation.

24:07.548 --> 24:11.486
But this generosity is among My own children now.

24:11.927 --> 24:14.203
They’re extremely generous,

24:14.419 --> 24:20.618
and they enjoy giving things to other,
than to in keeping things to themselves.

24:21.097 --> 24:24.009
It has happened not only in Australia,

24:24.157 --> 24:26.490
it has happened all over the world.

24:26.741 --> 24:34.777
If you see the Sahaja Yogis, how they are sacrificing

24:35.119 --> 24:38.056
their time, their money and everything

24:38.431 --> 24:42.070
to spread Sahaja Yoga, to help others,

24:42.450 --> 24:45.633
and to accommodate all kinds of things,

24:47.108 --> 24:50.032
all kinds of people within themselves.

24:50.978 --> 24:57.445
Such wisdom, such collective wisdom is there.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.160
We don't have to take any consensus.

25:01.435 --> 25:05.519
We don't have to say that “You all must say this” or

25:05.705 --> 25:08.683
“What is your opinion? Will you vote for it?”

25:08.808 --> 25:11.121
Everyone votes for the same.

25:11.371 --> 25:15.756
If somebody says, “All right, we have to give some

25:16.192 --> 25:21.337
help to, say, Bulgaria”, in Italy,

25:21.983 --> 25:27.033
immediately all the Italians
brought out their ornaments, everything there.

25:27.169 --> 25:31.599
“Mother, how much should wesend?” I said,” It's your lookout.”

25:31.688 --> 25:34.424
And the Bulgarians are surprised also

25:35.262 --> 25:38.040
that, “What have we done for these Italians

25:38.187 --> 25:40.705
that they should come down all the way to

25:40.808 --> 25:44.231
help us out with money, every kind of thing?”

25:46.459 --> 25:50.436
So this compassion, this love,

25:50.745 --> 25:55.028
this feeling of oneness, as if they are part and parcel of us,

25:55.244 --> 26:00.933
we are not separate. For Russia, you'll be surprised

26:01.873 --> 26:06.907
that they sent a television from America.

26:07.865 --> 26:11.220
Now America had nothing to do with Russia,

26:11.772 --> 26:14.690
but must be the Spirit of Shri Krishna

26:15.189 --> 26:22.848
trying to help the Spirit of right Agnya, must be.

26:23.981 --> 26:27.841
Such enthusiasm about Russia,

26:29.789 --> 26:32.192
it's unbelievable.

26:32.385 --> 26:36.954
They came in the buses, they came in the trains,
they went all the way

26:37.079 --> 26:40.321
to all these places, to far-fetched places,

26:44.024 --> 26:47.316
and they've achieved tremendous results.

26:49.176 --> 26:53.398
It's not only in Europe they're working it out

26:53.817 --> 26:56.363
around their own cities,

26:56.999 --> 27:01.046
but all the way they are working in Turkey,

27:02.495 --> 27:08.610
they are working in Nepal, and now somebody has gone to Japan.

27:09.506 --> 27:13.191
He is actually not a Japanese,

27:17.681 --> 27:19.291
he is from Rio

27:21.349 --> 27:25.208
and he has gone to Japan, is a physicist,

27:26.297 --> 27:29.981
but he is using some sort of a pantomime show

27:30.208 --> 27:35.335
on the streets to attract
the people and telling them about Sahaja Yoga.

27:35.699 --> 27:40.132
He telephoned to Me three, four times,
“Mother, You have beento Australia so many times.

27:40.416 --> 27:42.559
Why don't You come to Japan this time?”

27:42.673 --> 27:46.295
I said, ”All right, next time I will definitely come to

27:46.419 --> 27:47.926
Japan,” I promised him,

27:48.053 --> 27:51.786
“but this time I'm already programmed you see, by Sahaja Yogis,

27:52.667 --> 27:57.361
so I can't help it. They have fixed Me up everywhere”;

27:57.913 --> 28:00.915
and I don't mind because it’s so Sahaj,

28:01.081 --> 28:02.820
to Me it comes Sahaj.

28:02.935 --> 28:06.155
Many people ask Me, “Mother, You are traveling so much,” they say.

28:06.302 --> 28:07.836
I never think about it.

28:11.394 --> 28:18.971
Also, the collectivity you have now is tremendous.

28:19.470 --> 28:23.004
It's not only in Australia you have the collectivity,

28:24.422 --> 28:29.657
but the other day I telephoned to someone in India and told them,

28:29.863 --> 28:32.071
“I'm buying an ashram in Brisbane.”

28:32.209 --> 28:35.575
They said, “ Mother it's a very great thing. We are very happy.”

28:35.743 --> 28:37.378
Now for an Indian,

28:38.489 --> 28:42.423
what is there to be happy if we buy an ashram in Brisbane?

28:44.945 --> 28:46.681
So overjoyed about it.

28:46.954 --> 28:51.080
To them Brisbane is the same as Bombay or Delhi.

28:56.438 --> 28:58.986
The Heart has become so large,

28:59.474 --> 29:02.887
because Shiva is shining there, the Spirit is shining.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.477
It has become such a large Heart

29:05.644 --> 29:10.815
that it encompasses the whole universe,
I think, the way people look at it,

29:10.929 --> 29:15.441
that's why you all have become universal people.

29:16.156 --> 29:22.362
You don't only read about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

29:22.720 --> 29:27.529
you don't only knowabout it through your mind,

29:27.955 --> 29:33.022
you don't only try to follow it,
but you have imbibed it within yourself,

29:33.862 --> 29:37.195
which is so Sahaj, which you are not aware of it,

29:37.391 --> 29:40.520
how in a Sahaj way it has come to you.

29:41.730 --> 29:45.781
Now you know Australia was full of racialism once upon a time,

29:45.990 --> 29:49.427
nobody was come, allowed to come in here,

29:50.153 --> 29:55.062
might be fifty years back or so, but today in Australia

29:55.709 --> 29:57.335
what a change it is!

29:58.719 --> 30:02.786
Though they talked of Christianity and all those things, but

30:04.003 --> 30:06.963
they didn’t think what Christ has said,

30:07.485 --> 30:11.485
they were just the opposite of what Christianity should be.

30:14.412 --> 30:18.146
Islam is the same, Islam talks of very great things,

30:19.777 --> 30:25.542
but it has to be confessed that
the Muslims have nothing to do with Islam.

30:26.676 --> 30:30.403
Is absolutely from outside, if you see Christianity

30:32.353 --> 30:35.549
you have a very, very funny idea about it.

30:35.754 --> 30:39.736
If you ask any Hindu gentleman about Christianity

30:41.562 --> 30:44.828
they will say they are the worst possible people,

30:46.017 --> 30:52.549
very cunning, very aggressive
and it takes them no time to kill each other.

30:54.482 --> 31:02.485
Imagine, disciples of Christ;
but if you ask a Christian about a Muslim

31:02.746 --> 31:09.200
he will tell you, “Oh, these Muslims
are the most quarrelsome, dirtiest people ever born,

31:09.744 --> 31:12.806
fundamentalist.” They are all fundamentalist,

31:12.943 --> 31:18.410
whether it's a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anyone,
they're fundamentalist because

31:19.156 --> 31:20.889
they are reading one book

31:22.126 --> 31:24.232
and that too, just reading.

31:24.392 --> 31:27.590
The book also doesn't go, if the book goes inside

31:27.671 --> 31:30.104
they will realize that all these books

31:30.263 --> 31:34.329
are telling the same thing under different names, that's all.

31:34.670 --> 31:37.525
But that universal thing you have got,

31:37.661 --> 31:41.752
thanks to your Spirit, that was there quite intact

31:41.933 --> 31:44.667
and which has started shining within you.

31:45.695 --> 31:50.649
So we have now a new community, a new civilization

31:50.831 --> 31:58.796
of people who are extremely honest with themselves,
honest to each other.

32:00.599 --> 32:04.061
They are extremely righteous and good people,

32:04.855 --> 32:07.497
they are absolutely non-violent,

32:07.971 --> 32:14.971
absolutely law-abiding, very loving, affectionate,

32:15.388 --> 32:18.439
at the same time extremely constructive,

32:21.328 --> 32:27.087
and at the same time very intelligent.

32:28.969 --> 32:32.810
They understand Sahaja Yoga, it's such a subtle subject.

32:33.026 --> 32:35.559
Sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject,

32:35.668 --> 32:40.657
because you know everybody has failed to make people understand

32:41.145 --> 32:42.806
anything about truth.

32:43.190 --> 32:49.647
It’s an impossible situation. But this was the trick, your Spirit.

32:51.076 --> 32:55.316
Once your Spirit is enlightened it goes into your head

32:57.750 --> 33:00.911
without any difficulties, absolutely Sahaj.

33:01.682 --> 33:06.407
You don't know how difficult is this subject of Sahaja Yoga.

33:11.384 --> 33:15.681
It is such a fulfillment

33:19.848 --> 33:22.019
for the desire of the Divine

33:23.346 --> 33:26.849
that your  Divinity is now expressing itself.

33:28.822 --> 33:33.793
When you are collective, you are more enjoying each other,

33:34.077 --> 33:42.499
you enjoy collective life. Individualism is against

33:42.896 --> 33:45.006
the spirit of the whole,

33:49.191 --> 33:53.056
but we have our own varieties.

33:53.774 --> 33:58.965
The way you live in other countries, in other atmospheres,

33:59.181 --> 34:04.282
with other traditions, that's how you are living.

34:08.786 --> 34:15.897
But among ourselves we have the same faith,

34:17.552 --> 34:21.641
the faith which is enlightened, which is not blind faith,

34:21.915 --> 34:27.300
enlightened faith, firstly that you are realized souls,

34:27.693 --> 34:31.426
secondly that there is an all-pervading Power.

34:32.390 --> 34:37.987
We have the same type of worship, whether it is Christ,

34:38.180 --> 34:42.293
whether it is Mohammed Sahib or whether it is Shiva.

34:44.102 --> 34:49.092
We all worship it the same way, we do not have a sort of a

34:51.009 --> 34:53.075
difference of opinion on that,

34:55.192 --> 34:57.726
like one church becoming ten churches

34:58.860 --> 35:03.258
and one Hinduism becoming ten Hinduisms. It's not like that.

35:04.539 --> 35:11.122
We are all Sahaja Yogis and we have all got the same principle

35:11.689 --> 35:14.501
binding us in a Sahaj manner.

35:15.430 --> 35:19.316
We don't have to say, “Oh we have to be principled,

35:19.566 --> 35:23.233
we have to be on this principle, we are Sahaja Yogis.”

35:24.174 --> 35:29.447
You have to be there, absolutely, because you have to be there.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.073
You just can't help it,

35:33.867 --> 35:39.036
because in your nature now the Spirit is shining.

35:43.140 --> 35:46.837
Also, you are becoming archetypes,

35:46.962 --> 35:49.895
I should say, in the real sense of the word,

35:50.251 --> 35:53.437
for the people who are not in Sahaj.

35:55.989 --> 36:01.741
Such people are not available anywhere.

36:02.672 --> 36:08.848
When people will see you they will think that what a model it is,
what a model of life.

36:09.064 --> 36:11.783
They don't drink, they don't smoke,

36:11.908 --> 36:14.762
they don't boast of it, they don't hate anyone,

36:14.865 --> 36:20.499
they love anyone, they are so dynamic, they are so creative,

36:21.042 --> 36:26.320
they are so constructive, they are so self-contented.

36:27.737 --> 36:30.347
They are not at all competitive,

36:31.402 --> 36:37.093
they cause no problem to Nature, they cause no problem to anything.

36:41.146 --> 36:43.812
They have become such beautiful people.

36:44.150 --> 36:46.029
Who are these people?

36:47.034 --> 36:51.102
Such beautiful people are the models. So now,

36:51.386 --> 36:54.519
individually you have to understand this part,

36:54.663 --> 36:59.980
that we have to be models in this country of Australia.

37:01.381 --> 37:11.606
Model of good behavior, good language, decent life,

37:12.014 --> 37:16.830
decorous life, not fighting with husband,

37:16.945 --> 37:19.803
fighting with wife, you see you open any television,

37:19.905 --> 37:22.037
just get a headache, I mean there's, there's no other

37:22.116 --> 37:26.905
thing but a husband fighting wife and a wife fighting husband.

37:29.004 --> 37:31.651
There should be wisdom about it.

37:33.295 --> 37:37.629
Fighting among yourselves, you see if so many people have gather

37:37.876 --> 37:41.812
in a pub what will happen that pub will burst out.

37:44.261 --> 37:46.462
They can never sit silently.

37:49.047 --> 37:52.786
The mayor of Cabella told Me, “It surprises me

37:53.330 --> 37:57.677
that in the church we are sitting for half an hour then we start

37:57.939 --> 38:02.739
nudging each other. ‘How long
is it going to take now? Better get out.’

38:03.299 --> 38:08.299
You get tired; and what are
these people doing for hours together with You?

38:08.635 --> 38:12.651
How are they so spellbound? They don't feel tired.

38:14.779 --> 38:19.550
I think they are special people.” I said, “They are, they are.”

38:23.065 --> 38:26.872
“But what do they do?” “They don't do anything,

38:27.438 --> 38:32.750
they are just enjoying.” He couldn't understand that

38:32.910 --> 38:37.439
once we had a Puja, Guru Puja, for about six hours altogether,

38:37.645 --> 38:41.351
and they were surprised that how these people are sitting;

38:41.498 --> 38:46.597
and all the people they were,
all the villagers, mostly they are elderly,

38:46.811 --> 38:50.401
they thought that these angels have come from somewhere,

38:50.560 --> 38:53.893
they are angelic people: they don't trouble you,

38:54.092 --> 38:57.196
they don't torture you, they look after you,

38:57.378 --> 39:04.191
they try to be kind to you, not only that but they try to

39:04.883 --> 39:13.287
bring joy to you. They were so surprised in that village.

39:14.164 --> 39:16.921
First they used to call Me “Princess”.

39:17.056 --> 39:19.702
Then they started calling Me “Goddess”,

39:19.827 --> 39:21.584
then they said,” You are Madonna.”

39:21.701 --> 39:25.542
Whatever they could think of the best, they started

39:26.121 --> 39:32.285
saying all those things. They want now to come to Sahaja Yoga,

39:33.804 --> 39:38.158
but I said, “Let us see now.”
After some time, we'll work it out for them also.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.705
They are so nice now by seeing

39:42.933 --> 39:46.333
how the Sahaja Yogis are, because I seldom go out;

39:46.515 --> 39:49.272
but seeing the way Sahaja Yogis are,

39:49.465 --> 39:52.582
that the land behind the house

39:52.911 --> 39:56.880
was not even given to Prince Dorio
who was willing to pay lot of money,

39:57.004 --> 39:59.367
because he wanted to have a road that way;

39:59.469 --> 40:03.043
but to Me they rushed forward

40:04.845 --> 40:08.822
and at a very nominal price they gave Me that land.

40:08.950 --> 40:12.269
They said, “It is for You only, please have it.”

40:13.846 --> 40:17.469
The whole village is getting into transformation.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.632
But the dedication you have is very remarkable,

40:27.288 --> 40:30.097
surprises Me, really surprises Me.

40:31.707 --> 40:34.018
I have never taught you much,

40:35.005 --> 40:38.005
but the way you are dedicated in everything!

40:42.374 --> 40:47.077
Everyone who is not a Sahaja Yogi

40:47.916 --> 40:55.506
will be charmed the way you are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, to Me.

40:56.775 --> 41:01.283
Sometimes I think, “What have I done? I have done nothing.”

41:01.612 --> 41:06.623
You had your Kundalini, you had your Spirit, that's all,

41:08.528 --> 41:15.942
but such a difference, with little distance you covered,

41:16.554 --> 41:18.595
and such a difference!

41:19.479 --> 41:23.735
Can you imagine an Indian woman coming to Australia,

41:24.291 --> 41:29.932
finding this love, this affection and this dedication?
Unbelievable!

41:34.411 --> 41:37.866
They all think that I must be mesmerizing you.

41:38.467 --> 41:42.145
Nobody can believe that you could be that dedicated,

41:42.281 --> 41:44.977
take so much trouble, so much care;

41:45.193 --> 41:47.934
I mean just imagine the flowers that you have brought,

41:48.053 --> 41:50.179
just imagine all this you have done,

41:50.258 --> 41:52.852
I mean just imagine the way they brought another

41:52.943 --> 41:57.353
big car so that your Mother should be
brought here without any difficulty.

41:57.490 --> 41:58.725
All this love,

42:00.755 --> 42:06.671
all this affection, this care, I never asked for anything.

42:06.954 --> 42:08.810
I could have walked down,

42:08.904 --> 42:12.733
if you had said we have to walk,
I would have walked, I would never have said no.

42:12.870 --> 42:15.325
I never expected all this thing.

42:16.312 --> 42:19.883
But the way you want to express your love to Me,

42:19.986 --> 42:27.219
this dedication is so much and you sacrifice so much for that.

42:28.297 --> 42:31.159
Really you are sacrificing quite a lot,

42:33.903 --> 42:40.898
your time, your effort, to come
all the way to this far-off place for this Puja.

42:43.584 --> 42:47.471
All the gain that you have from Puja is only possible

42:47.743 --> 42:52.232
when you are a realized soul, otherwise it is useless

42:53.231 --> 42:57.845
to do any Puja, any worship. People go to church,

42:58.367 --> 43:00.832
sing few hymns and come back.

43:00.923 --> 43:04.457
They are just the same and afterwards go to the pub,

43:04.790 --> 43:09.590
because they think pub is the only place
where they can get some joy.

43:10.267 --> 43:15.236
One has to exert, one has to sacrifice,

43:15.541 --> 43:18.044
though I may say that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest thing.

43:18.148 --> 43:22.116
You don't have to go to
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all that,

43:22.207 --> 43:28.409
but still you have to sacrifice your time, your attention.

43:29.536 --> 43:34.489
Formerly you might be going to some rock music,

43:35.770 --> 43:38.868
you might be going to some pubs also,

43:39.048 --> 43:42.607
you might be enjoying all these things;
but you have given up everything,

43:42.745 --> 43:45.612
without My telling you, just have given up

43:45.693 --> 43:47.762
and you are so pure now.

43:48.533 --> 43:52.533
Your attention is so pure you can't enjoy all these things.

43:54.111 --> 43:58.178
Don't you think it's very remarkable that this has happened?

43:59.353 --> 44:02.947
This community, I don't have to tell you,

44:03.752 --> 44:07.684
I don't have to educate, I must say

44:07.843 --> 44:10.576
that all these things you have given up.

44:11.074 --> 44:15.471
Suddenly I find all of you have become so clean,

44:15.733 --> 44:18.612
so beautiful, your chakras so clean.

44:21.220 --> 44:27.185
Is it that these are your purva punyas that is working out?

44:28.841 --> 44:32.692
But still I would say you must know your self-esteem,

44:32.795 --> 44:36.795
that you are Sahaja Yogis, and how can you behave like this

44:36.899 --> 44:42.169
if you are a Sahaja Yogi? You cannot. Now you are a Sahaja Yogi,

44:42.657 --> 44:47.577
so that dignity, that wisdom has to be there;

44:49.930 --> 44:56.050
the compassion, the love, the unity of purpose should be there.

44:57.784 --> 45:01.280
All over the world you have brothers and sisters,

45:01.396 --> 45:05.942
this brotherhood and sisterhood is everywhere.

45:06.192 --> 45:10.531
You have rakhi sisters, you have very pure relationships.

45:11.450 --> 45:15.372
Anything impure is just thrown out in a Sahaj manner.

45:16.166 --> 45:20.065
Those who do not fit into it just get out of it.

45:23.399 --> 45:28.940
We have now very beautiful families, very beautiful children,

45:29.904 --> 45:36.372
it's, just think of it.
Moses saved some Jews but what are they good for, nothing,

45:38.085 --> 45:41.201
what's the use of saving such people?

45:42.029 --> 45:47.754
Then Christ came and talked about this thing,

45:48.110 --> 45:53.361
and this is what has happened to Christianity.

45:54.042 --> 45:58.526
Mohammed came and talked of very nice things, I must tell you.

45:58.654 --> 46:01.656
He never made it a rigid religion, never.

46:01.873 --> 46:05.704
It was very flexible, and He said, “You must get the knowledge.”

46:05.818 --> 46:08.593
So according to them, knowledge was to read the book

46:08.710 --> 46:11.984
and to interpret it and to be an intellectual.

46:16.451 --> 46:20.100
After that came Guru Nanaka also, you know that.

46:20.339 --> 46:23.554
What has happened to Sikhs, where they have gone?

46:23.679 --> 46:26.346
“Sikh” means the person who has learnt,

46:26.745 --> 46:28.874
learnt the Divine laws.

46:29.963 --> 46:34.353
If I say you have to follow the Divine laws, how?
You are not connected,

46:34.602 --> 46:37.357
you don't know what are the Divine laws are.

46:37.482 --> 46:40.549
Just follow: “We want to follow Divine laws.”

46:41.133 --> 46:44.067
Now you are hanging somewhere on this earth,

46:44.221 --> 46:46.764
the Divine laws are working there,

46:46.912 --> 46:49.347
how are you going to work out the Divine laws

46:49.443 --> 46:51.176
if you are not connected?

46:51.653 --> 46:55.053
But you know immediately what are the Divine laws;

46:55.192 --> 46:58.062
you are going against it, as soon as you go against it

46:58.153 --> 47:01.953
you know you can feel it on your central nervous system.

47:02.132 --> 47:08.139
You can feel it on your hands,
that you are doing something against the Divine laws.

47:09.102 --> 47:12.297
Immediately you know and if you are alert

47:12.389 --> 47:16.357
you'll immediately try to change. You'll think,

47:17.355 --> 47:22.962
“That's not correct, this is the truth about myself.”

47:23.098 --> 47:25.635
You start judging yourself all the time

47:25.750 --> 47:31.225
and you want to put yourself right
because you don't like it that way.

47:32.813 --> 47:37.288
So many ideas you have about your personal life

47:38.104 --> 47:40.641
are that, you see, there should be

47:40.750 --> 47:45.316
“a wife who should spoil me” or “a husband who should spoil me”,

47:45.408 --> 47:49.141
“My child should be like this”, and - all finished now.

47:49.829 --> 47:53.524
What do you want? “I want a real Sahaja Yogini”,

47:54.204 --> 47:56.926
“I want a real Sahaja Yogi to marry”,

47:57.052 --> 48:00.252
and after that the marriage becomes a blessing.

48:00.578 --> 48:05.906
How? How these flowers have come out, that's how.

48:07.653 --> 48:11.233
It's all innately built within you, all this beauty.

48:11.358 --> 48:18.416
You just start showing, but it has to sprout, it has to come up.

48:25.526 --> 48:31.122
This penance, so-called, is no penance to you.

48:31.280 --> 48:34.727
They say “We are enjoying this place”, I mean it's a

48:34.830 --> 48:38.739
place for penance only, the way things are here,

48:40.100 --> 48:43.365
there are not even closed bathrooms.

48:43.932 --> 48:47.932
People are finding it rather difficult to take a bath even.

48:48.858 --> 48:55.114
It's quite a penance to come to such a far-fetched place,

48:55.398 --> 48:59.284
or to travel in Maharashtra is another big penance.

48:59.431 --> 49:04.588
But you enjoy it, I mean you were missing; they said,
“We are missing our buses.” I said, “Really?

49:07.102 --> 49:12.612
I thought you would be happy. “No, no, Mother we are missing.”
I mean it was an adventure for them,

49:12.853 --> 49:19.313
they liked the way they were jostled and they were given hiccups,

49:19.472 --> 49:21.248
they’re very happy about it,

49:21.351 --> 49:24.727
that all this was, this was like an adventure.

49:24.988 --> 49:27.811
Everything which we call as tapasya

49:28.265 --> 49:31.584
or as the penance becomes an adventure for them,

49:31.687 --> 49:34.820
and the way they describe is very interesting.

49:35.190 --> 49:38.532
Like these musicians, they went to Russia and got lost,

49:38.657 --> 49:44.724
and when they came back, and they were describing the
whole thing with such description,

49:45.369 --> 49:49.199
as if God was just taking them from places to places.

49:50.050 --> 49:54.367
And how they were helped every moment, how they came

49:54.583 --> 49:59.310
to Italy sudden and how they came to Milan, to the ashram.

49:59.515 --> 50:02.596
The whole description is tremendous.

50:05.215 --> 50:11.953
Now think of what you have achieved, but you can't even think,

50:12.713 --> 50:14.195
you just achieve.

50:15.829 --> 50:23.414
Without thinking you achieve things,
is the blessing of your Spirit, blessing of Shiva.

50:24.537 --> 50:29.694
The Spirit is the witness and you develop that witness state.

50:30.715 --> 50:34.862
To you all this looks like a funny stage

50:34.965 --> 50:37.889
where people are doing this and that, politics, economics,

50:38.015 --> 50:40.405
you see as something absurd.

50:41.460 --> 50:44.926
I went down to Russia, there were so many Russians.

50:45.292 --> 50:50.002
I told them that there's a very bad shape the politics is here now

50:50.138 --> 50:52.868
and you are having very bad times with your food.

50:52.990 --> 50:56.564
“No, Mother, we have no problem with food or anything,

50:56.688 --> 51:00.529
but what do we care? We have got the spiritual food,

51:00.802 --> 51:04.971
let these people fight, do whatever, we are not bothered.”

51:06.763 --> 51:11.696
They were least bothered as there was a coup or anything,
least bothered.

51:12.569 --> 51:15.388
“Let them fight, let them do what they like,

51:15.557 --> 51:19.474
we are in a different situation.”

51:19.667 --> 51:23.686
I said, “Which situation you are?” “We are in the Kingdom of God,”

51:23.800 --> 51:25.021
they told Me,

51:25.350 --> 51:32.151
“We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry
about these kingdoms and things, let them fight.”

51:32.312 --> 51:36.674
Such contented people, so very beautiful.

51:36.830 --> 51:40.033
You have so many brothers and sisters there.

51:40.147 --> 51:44.058
Early in the morning I got up and they had, I don't know when,

51:44.150 --> 51:49.791
planted flowers on the road of My house there,

51:51.798 --> 51:54.859
flowers all along, rows after rows.

51:55.018 --> 51:59.914
I don't know when they came, when they did it and disappeared.

52:00.221 --> 52:04.243
So sweet, I tell you, except for

52:05.593 --> 52:09.300
crying with joy  I didn't know what to say.

52:10.021 --> 52:11.860
If this happens all over,

52:12.270 --> 52:14.594
what a world we can have.

52:15.070 --> 52:19.435
There are of course some people who are exceptional,
who are troublesome,

52:19.572 --> 52:25.919
who are not all right; it's all right, forget about them.

52:30.228 --> 52:40.583
So now, you are the people who have understood what is God,

52:42.069 --> 52:48.426
what is Sadashiva. Now you have faith in Him which is not blind,

52:48.801 --> 52:51.656
you also know that His powers work,

52:51.985 --> 52:56.585
that His laws work, all other laws are useless,
only His laws works.

53:01.181 --> 53:04.545
You have seen, experienced in your lifetime

53:04.897 --> 53:09.169
how miracles are taking place, how things are working out.

53:09.317 --> 53:12.548
A simple miracle I would say, it was desired

53:12.696 --> 53:16.426
that Shiva Puja should be around some hills,

53:17.027 --> 53:19.155
but they couldn't arrange,

53:19.292 --> 53:24.778
they were trying for some other place
which could not be arranged, so you are here.

53:24.994 --> 53:30.708
You desire and it works, as if your desire acts.

53:33.270 --> 53:37.009
But we have some people who are still mediocre,

53:37.179 --> 53:39.928
who are behaving in a mediocre manner,

53:40.041 --> 53:43.107
very dull, some of them are very dull people.

53:43.477 --> 53:45.477
They cannot understand Sahaj,

53:45.670 --> 53:49.761
they don't understand how much they can gain out of it.

53:50.045 --> 53:53.273
So you shouldn't worry about them.

53:54.475 --> 53:59.124
Then you have to think about the whole collective which is good

53:59.385 --> 54:02.718
and one or two useless people, forget about them.

54:03.204 --> 54:06.149
If they come up well and good, if they don't come up,

54:06.274 --> 54:08.757
we are not going to force them.

54:09.348 --> 54:14.084
We'll be getting more and more people, more and more people.

54:15.173 --> 54:18.017
I'm sure it will happen.

54:19.014 --> 54:23.281
But the greatest thing you have got is the complete integration

54:26.340 --> 54:31.893
within your being: your heart, your mind,

54:34.297 --> 54:39.589
your liver I should say, your attention, are all integrated.

54:40.712 --> 54:43.699
There's no quarrel, there's no struggle

54:44.519 --> 54:51.057
between your heart and your mind, heart and your brain.

54:51.840 --> 54:56.782
Whatever your brain thinks, your heart accepts,

54:57.065 --> 55:01.231
whatever your heart wants, your brain accepts,

55:01.424 --> 55:07.093
whatever your attention is there, is completely integrated

55:07.839 --> 55:11.558
with your heart and with your brain.

55:13.282 --> 55:17.482
You must see the other people, they don't want to do something

55:18.247 --> 55:21.770
but they have to do it because they’re habituated.

55:21.931 --> 55:25.511
So many people told Me: “We want to give up this, we can't.”

55:25.636 --> 55:29.374
Once you have got the Spirit, you get that power

55:30.180 --> 55:33.313
that you can surpass all the said temptations,

55:33.434 --> 55:37.139
not only temptations, also the differentiations

55:37.310 --> 55:40.232
that you always make: “This is that, this is that.”

55:40.358 --> 55:46.026
But you integrate, you integrate among yourselves,

55:46.707 --> 55:49.516
you integrate among different states,

55:49.641 --> 55:52.677
you integrate among different countries.

55:54.435 --> 55:59.080
The whole cosmos seems to be integrated, woven

55:59.818 --> 56:05.591
and governed by the Divine laws.

56:08.176 --> 56:15.285
This integration gives you a complete understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

56:18.152 --> 56:26.393
mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

56:30.870 --> 56:35.802
It’s not by some sort of a brain-washing

56:36.392 --> 56:42.795
or bombarding, but just through the light of Spirit
you have seen the truth

56:43.895 --> 56:48.847
and you have understood it. Also you have so many powers.

56:49.981 --> 56:54.181
You do not want to exert, that's a different point altogether,

56:54.618 --> 56:56.148
but just try.

56:58.428 --> 57:03.493
One word of prayer from you is very powerful

57:03.518 --> 57:07.405
than hundreds of prayers of these people.

57:11.113 --> 57:15.874
One asking is much more powerful

57:16.835 --> 57:19.406
than thousands of these askings.

57:19.781 --> 57:22.591
You have never tried that; try that,

57:23.124 --> 57:27.057
you are extremely powerful, whatever you desire works out.

57:30.391 --> 57:33.915
You have other powers of giving Realization,

57:34.233 --> 57:36.700
also curing, you have so many powers

57:37.295 --> 57:40.928
but most of the time you'll bring somebody to Me to be cured.

57:41.133 --> 57:43.740
No, no, there's no need.

57:44.058 --> 57:48.191
You have given all powers; you have all the powers, use them.

57:48.968 --> 57:53.546
Don't be afraid, use these powers, and you will be amazed

57:54.102 --> 57:56.419
how these power work out,

57:57.916 --> 58:07.739
and how you become more and more embedded in your faith,
in yourself.

58:10.675 --> 58:13.246
Of course there are Sahaja Yogis

58:13.564 --> 58:17.215
who are made to sit on the throne but still they are begging,

58:17.306 --> 58:19.511
what can you do about it?

58:22.051 --> 58:27.073
You are so very powerful in collective and also individually.

58:29.512 --> 58:32.367
Whatever you want, you can have it.

58:33.286 --> 58:36.726
I am desireless because the Divine,

58:37.911 --> 58:44.040
the Divine power is working for Me, everything
- I don't have to desire - it knows.

58:45.344 --> 58:48.611
I don't desire anything, but you have to desire,

58:50.372 --> 58:54.024
you have to pray, you have to ask.

58:54.342 --> 58:58.184
And the wider you become your prayers will be wider,

58:58.332 --> 59:01.211
for a wider world, wider vision,

59:01.642 --> 59:04.978
not limited to your children, not limited to your family,

59:05.069 --> 59:10.919
not limited to one place, but unlimited areas you'll cover.

59:17.092 --> 59:21.786
So we become very conscious and alert

59:22.331 --> 59:27.249
about whatever is happening in the world
to put our attention there.

59:27.408 --> 59:31.827
We try to find out what's wrong with this
and what's wrong with that.

59:31.964 --> 59:34.977
We are not just worried about a small little ashram,

59:35.079 --> 59:39.319
but we are worried about the whole world to find out what's wrong,

59:39.510 --> 59:41.503
what can we do, what can we desire,

59:41.583 --> 59:47.852
because if we have the power,
and if we can operate the Divine power,

59:49.097 --> 59:52.646
then why not we work it out ourselves? We can.

59:52.964 --> 59:55.738
So your attention can go to any place.

59:55.819 --> 59:57.689
It can go to Nicaragua,

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:07.642
it can go to Israel, it can go to Saddam Hussein,
to any place that you want to work it out.

01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:10.829
It moves, it's mobile, it's universal.

01:00:12.168 --> 01:00:19.101
Just start expanding your heart, your mind and your attention.

01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:31.669
Your faith in Me, I must say, is great.
I am Myself surprised at that.

01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:41.374
I am quite a camouflage.

01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:46.555
It's not easy to understand Me, I don't understand Myself!

01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:58.348
On one side of course I'm Divine, no doubt,

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:03.130
on the other side, I am very human.

01:01:04.287 --> 01:01:10.135
Even in a film, if I see somebody suffering,
I start crying, can't bear.

01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:15.046
I can't cure children because I can't see their sufferings.

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:20.799
It's another aspect of Mine. I’ve made Myself extremely human,

01:01:25.142 --> 01:01:31.402
and this Divinity of Mine also is just Sahaj.

01:01:32.842 --> 01:01:34.374
I've done nothing,

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:39.556
I've been like this and I'm like this, I've not achieved anything.

01:01:39.851 --> 01:01:43.918
If I've achieved anything, is understanding of human beings,

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.318
because I always felt that all these Incarnations

01:01:48.488 --> 01:01:53.712
and all these prophets never understood human beings.

01:01:53.883 --> 01:01:57.497
They never knew that they are not enlightened people

01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:01.817
and no use talking to them of these great things, it’s all a waste.

01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:03.697
It's like a blind person,

01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:08.294
you explain to him all the colors and the beauty of the stage.

01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:24.425
And so this human realization,
I should, that I had, is so beautiful.

01:02:26.908 --> 01:02:30.583
Now I understand what is the joy of bhakti,

01:02:31.605 --> 01:02:34.969
what is the joy of gnyana,

01:02:36.466 --> 01:02:43.110
what is the joy of karma, because a person
who doesn't do anything,

01:02:44.405 --> 01:02:53.571
a person who has no bhakti and who has no gnyana

01:02:58.436 --> 01:03:00.912
is just wakened completely.

01:03:03.294 --> 01:03:06.266
I had to fill in Myself with all these things

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:08.998
that I have to know the gnyana,

01:03:09.135 --> 01:03:12.862
not the gnyana of the Divine because after all that is,

01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:18.814
that is not difficult, because if I am that, I know that,

01:03:19.348 --> 01:03:22.278
but the gnyana of the human beings,

01:03:23.877 --> 01:03:29.648
the problems of the human beings, I had to study for years

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:35.235
the human beings to work it out.

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:39.031
But once it has worked,

01:03:41.072 --> 01:03:46.472
that's what is said that there is Divinity in
you has started expressing itself,

01:03:47.659 --> 01:03:51.795
and such beautiful Divine lights are sitting before Me.

01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:59.208
I bless you all from My heart where resides the Shiva,
the Sadashiva,

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:02.233
and Sadashiva blesses you.

01:04:02.777 --> 01:04:07.151
He is a innocent personality, absolutely innocent.

01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:14.444
He is the One who is beyond any attachments,

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:20.791
absolutely beyond any attachments.

01:04:22.272 --> 01:04:30.026
He is the One who is watching,
watching all of you with such admiration,

01:04:31.217 --> 01:04:40.657
His joy knows no bounds, it's tremendous,
as if He is dancing with joy.

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:50.045
It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here.

01:04:50.431 --> 01:04:54.828
I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you,

01:04:54.941 --> 01:04:57.112
that's the most important.

01:04:57.396 --> 01:05:05.400
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates in your being,

01:05:05.718 --> 01:05:10.731
because the Spirit has awakened in your attention,

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:14.028
in your central nervous system.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.410
That's the most important thing you have to do.

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:21.046
The rest of it is Sahaj.

01:05:23.078 --> 01:05:25.787
The rest of it is absolutely Sahaj.

01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:28.305
May God bless you all.
