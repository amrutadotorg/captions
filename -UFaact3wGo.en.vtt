00:03:12.138 --> 00:03:19.138
It’s very nice to see all of you here, so
many of you from Australia,

00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:24.077
to worship Shiva, Sadashiva.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:29.253
I think this is a very important occasion.

00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:45.926
Is important, because Sadashiva,

00:03:47.706 --> 00:03:51.232
the God Almighty, who is One,

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:57.544
is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Shiva.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:15.253
We have to understand that so many people
came on this earth at different times, in

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:26.798
different countries, and they talked to different
people about righteousness, that is dharma,

00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:32.811
about how to elevate yourself,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.219
and all of them have said that you have to be reborn,

00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:44.030
that is, you have to become the Spirit.

00:04:44.416 --> 00:04:45.912
They have all

00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:58.741
said the same thing because they knew, without

00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:09.610
the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:14.956
you will not be able to understand spirituality.

00:05:31.408 --> 00:05:33.608
You have the Spirit within you,

00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:38.624
which is all the time in a witness state.

00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:42.700
Why all the religions have failed?

00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:48.131
Because they did not get their Self-Realization.

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.244
They did not become the Spirit.

00:05:55.566 --> 00:06:00.390
So there's a tremendous difference between you and all others

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:04.856
who profess something. It looks as if they are hypocrites.

00:06:06.313 --> 00:06:12.136
They intellectualize it as you know, they explain it very well,

00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:18.488
but you can see very clearly
that they haven't absorbed spirituality.

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:27.855
That absorption was impossible without Self-Realization.

00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:32.459
This everybody felt.

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:37.445
Buddha went to this limit and Mahavira both, to say that,

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:39.871
forget about God,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.476
forget about God Almighty,

00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:47.113
you just get your Self, your Self-Realization.

00:06:48.254 --> 00:06:51.235
So they are called as atheist in Idikshavadi,

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:53.675
they don't believe in Ishwara,

00:06:54.785 --> 00:07:00.281
but they felt that the way
people are just talking about God Almighty

00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:03.126
and what the books have said.

00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:10.373
These books also speak of righteousness,

00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:15.860
except in some books there has been some sort of interference,

00:07:16.324 --> 00:07:21.354
but most of them speak of spirituality

00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:24.484
and what you have to achieve,

00:07:25.598 --> 00:07:29.211
what is the purpose of religion.

00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:38.960
All that is spoken very well, written very well.

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:44.113
They'll tell you, “You have to be this, you have to be that,

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:47.126
this is not good, that is not good.”

00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:52.549
So even the first state, where the dharma has to be established,

00:07:53.131 --> 00:08:01.736
was not established:
where people are not supposed to cheat each other,

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:08.781
there has to be justice, there has to be collectivity,

00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:16.235
there has to be love and understanding, no jealousies,

00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:23.951
no hypocrisy; where it's a different race,

00:08:24.115 --> 00:08:25.648
a different community,

00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:30.198
we can call it a different civilization is to be created.

00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:35.838
Everybody claims that they are the chosen ones,

00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:38.847
but they are just the same.

00:08:39.982 --> 00:08:44.752
There's a tremendous achievement of Sahaja Yogis

00:08:45.352 --> 00:08:48.932
that they have achieved this state of Spirit.

00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:54.442
So now you can absorb dharma without any difficulties,

00:08:54.782 --> 00:08:59.802
without any difficulties. You would not like to cheat anyone,

00:09:00.188 --> 00:09:02.188
you'd not like to kill anyone,

00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:05.776
you'd not like to be violent with anyone.

00:09:06.377 --> 00:09:10.889
You will stick on to the truth, the truth,

00:09:11.427 --> 00:09:14.905
very few people can stick on to the truth.

00:09:17.184 --> 00:09:22.317
Then you are not people who are going to rob others,

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:29.753
you have no intention at all, doesn't come into your mind

00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:33.991
that you are tempted to take away things from others.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:40.254
First of all, which is the most important thing,

00:09:40.437 --> 00:09:44.462
that you have a rapport with God Almighty;

00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:52.350
that you are, in a way, in awe about God.

00:09:53.194 --> 00:09:57.987
There is awe, not I would say fear,

00:09:58.407 --> 00:10:02.363
because fear is all dispelled, there's no more fear for you,

00:10:04.177 --> 00:10:08.729
but you have awe for God, that He is God Almighty.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:16.795
You won't cheat people, you won't cheat Sahaja Yoga for money,

00:10:18.236 --> 00:10:28.800
you won't fight for power or for something that is material.

00:10:30.558 --> 00:10:33.526
All your attention will be towards

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:38.547
the expansion of your awareness in the light of the Spirit.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:42.912
This is the vision of your Mother,

00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:47.412
because Shiva is just a witness,

00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:50.993
Sadashiva is just witnessing all this play.

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:55.200
He doesn't have any visions about it,

00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:59.104
but now He must have lots of hopes after seeing

00:10:59.864 --> 00:11:03.864
the kind of people that are created out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:10.661
Very unique, very beautiful,
wonderful angel-like people have been created.

00:11:11.656 --> 00:11:17.776
Now only problem is that
you have to keep to your angelic foundations;

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.395
but I find that sometimes it happens, doesn't matter,

00:11:25.262 --> 00:11:28.171
that you fall, and falter.

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:38.078
Again, you rise into your awareness and try to locate

00:11:43.215 --> 00:11:49.932
the new dimensions that are available to you,
that you can find out.

00:11:51.363 --> 00:11:58.363
All this is possible because now
you belong really to the chosen ones’ race.

00:11:58.993 --> 00:12:03.162
You must know also that you are very special people.

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:07.459
It is not realized sometimes by Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:13.400
They have no self-esteem as to what they have got.

00:12:15.113 --> 00:12:17.482
Once you have self-esteem,

00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:24.871
you will have the wisdom to understand
what is your role in this lifetime.

00:12:28.692 --> 00:12:31.599
This self-esteem is only possible

00:12:31.872 --> 00:12:38.751
if you see other people who are lost in the mire of nonsense.

00:12:40.872 --> 00:12:43.863
Now you are a special community I said,

00:12:44.045 --> 00:12:50.325
you are the one who are going to create that great community.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:02.914
Now whatever are the dharma’s

00:13:05.114 --> 00:13:09.431
points, or we can say dharma’s aspects,

00:13:10.396 --> 00:13:16.357
you can imbibe them Sahaj. “Sahaj” has a very special meaning:

00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:20.133
Spontaneously, you do not have to exert,

00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:28.616
you do not have to go into a penance or work it out.

00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:35.602
In a Sahaj way you can do it. “Sahaj” also means easy.

00:13:36.578 --> 00:13:40.690
You can have it in your heart, all these qualities,

00:13:40.953 --> 00:13:43.785
without any difficulty whatsoever.

00:13:44.828 --> 00:13:50.902
It's the easiest thing for you
to be righteous than to be otherwise.

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:55.741
It's easier for you to be honest than to be otherwise.

00:13:57.198 --> 00:14:06.980
So this speciality that you have got
is the vision of all the saints, of all the prophets,

00:14:07.215 --> 00:14:12.693
of all the seers, of all the Incarnations,

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:20.154
There are lectures and lectures people give,
“You must do like this, you must do that way.”

00:14:21.254 --> 00:14:27.441
They think that by educating people into
these principles people will be all right, they cannot.

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:34.282
If you try to educate them, it will go as an ego into their heads,

00:14:34.452 --> 00:14:38.357
because you get educated only through your ego.

00:14:39.575 --> 00:14:45.244
Is not Sahaj, is not Sahaj sustenance, Sahaja dharana,

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:49.970
it is something that is put

00:14:50.238 --> 00:14:52.367
onto you from outside,

00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:00.584
but for you it is very easy, that you can imbibe

00:15:00.995 --> 00:15:04.553
all the aspects of dharma very easily.

00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:07.865
You don't have to do anything, you will not just do it.

00:15:08.273 --> 00:15:11.814
I've known people who used to take drugs,

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:18.410
who used to abuse people, beat. There's one fellow,
he said he used to carry a revolver always with him.

00:15:18.671 --> 00:15:23.782
He's become such a quiet, silent, beautiful person

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:28.691
that unbelievable, but his wife tells Me that he was like this.

00:15:29.138 --> 00:15:32.091
So now you are that special people,

00:15:32.942 --> 00:15:38.622
and those people who have not got their Realization

00:15:40.307 --> 00:15:43.405
cannot get to dharma easily.

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:52.156
Then the second point which is very easy for you

00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:59.802
is to love another person, to care for another person.

00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:05.862
Is very easy, you would love to do that.

00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:14.987
You would love to care for people who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.241
also who are non-SahajaYogis.

00:16:18.648 --> 00:16:20.941
Sahaja Yoga is quite flexible.

00:16:21.383 --> 00:16:25.609
If you see somebody who is a non-SahajaYogi

00:16:26.056 --> 00:16:30.225
and also suffering, you would immediately jump

00:16:31.972 --> 00:16:35.926
to see that that person gets help from you.

00:16:36.873 --> 00:16:42.120
I have seen people in Sahaja Yoga, very interesting they are.

00:16:44.853 --> 00:16:51.290
One gentleman came to Me and said,
“Mother I have no money, I want to go

00:16:52.314 --> 00:16:55.005
and do some work for Sahaja Yoga

00:16:55.136 --> 00:16:59.487
but I have no money, even I have no money for the household.”

00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:04.317
I said, “All right, that's very good, you come tomorrow,
I'll give you the money.”

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.145
Next day he never came. I said, “What's the matter?”

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.256
He said, “There was somebody
sitting with You that time when I was talking with You,

00:17:15.383 --> 00:17:18.551
if You remember.”
I said, “I don't remember so clearly.”

00:17:18.694 --> 00:17:21.242
“All right, I also don't know him,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.366
as soon as I went out he said, ‘How much money do you want?’

00:17:25.507 --> 00:17:27.543
I told him, ‘At least this much.’

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:31.160
Immediately he took out the money and gave it to me.”

00:17:31.378 --> 00:17:36.641
So who haven't got something in Sahaja Yoga, who hasn't got money,

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:40.544
immediately we run to help that person.

00:17:40.794 --> 00:17:45.973
Like you'll be amazed that there are these six countries like

00:17:46.093 --> 00:17:51.884
Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Poland,

00:17:56.091 --> 00:18:07.798
Czechoslovakia, all these countries, even Hungary, have been helped

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:12.157
by one country or other,

00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:16.968
even the East Asian countries are helped by Australians.

00:18:17.358 --> 00:18:20.303
I never told them, I never asked them,

00:18:20.598 --> 00:18:23.032
I never said that, “You have to help.”

00:18:23.182 --> 00:18:27.557
They just came forward that
“Mother, somehow we have to help them,

00:18:27.886 --> 00:18:34.164
we'll arrange, we'll get to them,
we'll manage this, we'll do that.” It's very surprising,

00:18:34.868 --> 00:18:40.715
how they could just think of helping those countries.

00:18:41.782 --> 00:18:46.657
Then they made tickets for them,

00:18:47.142 --> 00:18:50.586
they brought them to India. They looked after,

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.679
Russians came to India, were looked after.

00:18:54.936 --> 00:18:57.915
Everybody was so full of compassion and love

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.704
but without feeling they have done anything, without feeling

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.864
in any way that they have done any obligation to someone.

00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:09.109
Nobody expected them to thank them
and write letters of thanks or anything.

00:19:10.527 --> 00:19:13.394
Whatever is done is finished now, that's...

00:19:14.711 --> 00:19:19.697
Nobody ever asked how much money was given,

00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:24.352
how much was spent, how much we had to give, nothing of the kind.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.581
At that spur of the moment everybody
come forward, they gave the money

00:19:28.745 --> 00:19:32.631
and the thing worked out. It was very surprising.

00:19:35.296 --> 00:19:39.522
For example France, France is looking after Romania.

00:19:40.002 --> 00:19:43.587
I didn't know they had done so much of work in Romania.

00:19:43.726 --> 00:19:49.698
I reached Hungary and suddenly
I find hundred-and-twenty-five Romanians there.

00:19:49.891 --> 00:19:54.335
My heart was really filled with such joy.
I said, “How are you here?”

00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:59.065
“French have arranged everything for us, Mother.”
“Really?”

00:19:59.356 --> 00:20:03.147
There were no French people there, no-one from France.

00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:06.085
And Romanians were singing so well

00:20:06.362 --> 00:20:10.438
that the Indians felt that,
“Oh wah, what is this, a new group has started?”

00:20:10.553 --> 00:20:13.479
All of them, and they never used books, without

00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:16.178
using the books they were singing, these Romanians.

00:20:16.313 --> 00:20:18.852
So I said, “Where are you going to stay in the night?”

00:20:18.988 --> 00:20:21.256
“We'll stay in a garden Mother, it's all right.”

00:20:21.362 --> 00:20:25.428
But I said, “How?” “We'll stay there, doesn't matter.”

00:20:25.836 --> 00:20:27.897
How secretly they helped.

00:20:28.022 --> 00:20:33.419
If I had not asked them, I would not have known how they have come.

00:20:34.986 --> 00:20:38.107
So this, to help the people who do not have,

00:20:38.221 --> 00:20:42.132
you can call them sort of a,
you can say those who are poorer than us.

00:20:45.294 --> 00:20:52.485
I have seen also people, how individually they look after others,

00:20:54.272 --> 00:21:00.204
and bring things for their friends, presents

00:21:02.676 --> 00:21:07.293
and beautiful things, just for their own satisfaction,

00:21:08.181 --> 00:21:10.857
not to oblige anyone or to

00:21:11.245 --> 00:21:14.156
later on say, “Oh I brought this sari for you.” Nothing,

00:21:14.305 --> 00:21:17.371
just to see that sari on another Sahaja Yogi.

00:21:19.513 --> 00:21:21.582
It's such a beautiful thing.

00:21:22.296 --> 00:21:27.149
Imagine these countries like England, France, Spain,

00:21:30.452 --> 00:21:36.695
Italy, Switzerland, very aggressive, very aggressive people.

00:21:37.368 --> 00:21:40.589
When they went out, not to help anyone

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:44.047
but to establish their empire

00:21:44.668 --> 00:21:51.668
or to destroy people, or to convert them or do
all kinds of things in the name of religion, in the name of God.

00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:57.636
But, when you go to other countries, you just want to help,

00:21:59.189 --> 00:22:02.021
give them all the help that is needed.

00:22:02.415 --> 00:22:07.778
I am Myself amazed how it works out so spontaneous in your heart

00:22:07.896 --> 00:22:11.642
that you should do this and you should work it out.

00:22:15.825 --> 00:22:19.659
This transformation that has taken place within you

00:22:19.981 --> 00:22:25.853
has brought out all the beauty of your heart,
of your compassion, of your love.

00:22:26.243 --> 00:22:29.265
And you give, want to give security to others,

00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:33.688
without expecting anything, without demanding anything.

00:22:34.573 --> 00:22:37.121
And you all enjoy it, doing that,

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:40.702
living in a simple place like this,

00:22:41.606 --> 00:22:45.236
under a tent, sitting, listening to Me,

00:22:45.702 --> 00:22:51.552
you don't want any comfort, just seek the comfort of your Spirit

00:22:51.876 --> 00:22:55.035
and enjoy the whole place, the Nature.

00:22:56.328 --> 00:23:00.226
Gradually I have seen also Sahaja Yogis are becoming

00:23:00.523 --> 00:23:05.838
extremely conscious of the ecological problem all over the world.

00:23:08.023 --> 00:23:11.822
They have started using things which are natural,

00:23:11.958 --> 00:23:16.214
which are artistic. It's something so surprising

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.032
that suddenly they have taken to artistic things.

00:23:21.019 --> 00:23:22.917
I know of a gentleman

00:23:25.459 --> 00:23:30.048
who had arms, ammunitions in his house, everything like that,

00:23:31.012 --> 00:23:34.062
but now he has beautiful things.

00:23:35.154 --> 00:23:38.689
Of course the arms and ammunition are on one side

00:23:38.791 --> 00:23:42.325
but such beautiful artistic things he has collected.

00:23:42.872 --> 00:23:45.278
So I said, “How did you get this?”

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.139
He said, “Mother I was thinking

00:23:47.242 --> 00:23:49.881
that You would like to see them and You'll feel happy,

00:23:49.972 --> 00:23:52.659
so I have bought for You to see,

00:23:52.918 --> 00:23:56.990
and if You want You can take anything.”
I said, “I don't want anything,

00:23:57.104 --> 00:23:59.037
you can keep it to yourself.”

00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:03.631
So this generosity, we’ll call it adhari,

00:24:04.969 --> 00:24:07.121
is a sign of an Incarnation.

00:24:07.548 --> 00:24:11.486
But this generosity is among My own children now.

00:24:11.927 --> 00:24:14.203
They’re extremely generous,

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:20.618
and they enjoy giving things to other,
than to in keeping things to themselves.

00:24:21.097 --> 00:24:24.009
It has happened not only in Australia,

00:24:24.157 --> 00:24:26.490
it has happened all over the world.

00:24:26.741 --> 00:24:34.777
If you see the Sahaja Yogis, how they are sacrificing

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:38.056
their time, their money and everything

00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:42.070
to spread Sahaja Yoga, to help others,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.633
and to accommodate all kinds of things,

00:24:47.108 --> 00:24:50.032
all kinds of people within themselves.

00:24:50.978 --> 00:24:57.445
Such wisdom, such collective wisdom is there.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.160
We don't have to take any consensus.

00:25:01.435 --> 00:25:05.519
We don't have to say that “You all must say this” or

00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:08.683
“What is your opinion? Will you vote for it?”

00:25:08.808 --> 00:25:11.121
Everyone votes for the same.

00:25:11.371 --> 00:25:15.756
If somebody says, “All right, we have to give some

00:25:16.192 --> 00:25:21.337
help to, say, Bulgaria”, in Italy,

00:25:21.983 --> 00:25:27.033
immediately all the Italians
brought out their ornaments, everything there.

00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:31.599
“Mother, how much should wesend?” I said,” It's your lookout.”

00:25:31.688 --> 00:25:34.424
And the Bulgarians are surprised also

00:25:35.262 --> 00:25:38.040
that, “What have we done for these Italians

00:25:38.187 --> 00:25:40.705
that they should come down all the way to

00:25:40.808 --> 00:25:44.231
help us out with money, every kind of thing?”

00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:50.436
So this compassion, this love,

00:25:50.745 --> 00:25:55.028
this feeling of oneness, as if they are part and parcel of us,

00:25:55.244 --> 00:26:00.933
we are not separate. For Russia, you'll be surprised

00:26:01.873 --> 00:26:06.907
that they sent a television from America.

00:26:07.865 --> 00:26:11.220
Now America had nothing to do with Russia,

00:26:11.772 --> 00:26:14.690
but must be the Spirit of Shri Krishna

00:26:15.189 --> 00:26:22.848
trying to help the Spirit of right Agnya, must be.

00:26:23.981 --> 00:26:27.841
Such enthusiasm about Russia,

00:26:29.789 --> 00:26:32.192
it's unbelievable.

00:26:32.385 --> 00:26:36.954
They came in the buses, they came in the trains,
they went all the way

00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:40.321
to all these places, to far-fetched places,

00:26:44.024 --> 00:26:47.316
and they've achieved tremendous results.

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:53.398
It's not only in Europe they're working it out

00:26:53.817 --> 00:26:56.363
around their own cities,

00:26:56.999 --> 00:27:01.046
but all the way they are working in Turkey,

00:27:02.495 --> 00:27:08.610
they are working in Nepal, and now somebody has gone to Japan.

00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:13.191
He is actually not a Japanese,

00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:19.291
he is from Rio

00:27:21.349 --> 00:27:25.208
and he has gone to Japan, is a physicist,

00:27:26.297 --> 00:27:29.981
but he is using some sort of a pantomime show

00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:35.335
on the streets to attract
the people and telling them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:35.699 --> 00:27:40.132
He telephoned to Me three, four times,
“Mother, You have beento Australia so many times.

00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:42.559
Why don't You come to Japan this time?”

00:27:42.673 --> 00:27:46.295
I said, ”All right, next time I will definitely come to

00:27:46.419 --> 00:27:47.926
Japan,” I promised him,

00:27:48.053 --> 00:27:51.786
“but this time I'm already programmed you see, by Sahaja Yogis,

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:57.361
so I can't help it. They have fixed Me up everywhere”;

00:27:57.913 --> 00:28:00.915
and I don't mind because it’s so Sahaj,

00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:02.820
to Me it comes Sahaj.

00:28:02.935 --> 00:28:06.155
Many people ask Me, “Mother, You are traveling so much,” they say.

00:28:06.302 --> 00:28:07.836
I never think about it.

00:28:11.394 --> 00:28:18.971
Also, the collectivity you have now is tremendous.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.004
It's not only in Australia you have the collectivity,

00:28:24.422 --> 00:28:29.657
but the other day I telephoned to someone in India and told them,

00:28:29.863 --> 00:28:32.071
“I'm buying an ashram in Brisbane.”

00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:35.575
They said, “ Mother it's a very great thing. We are very happy.”

00:28:35.743 --> 00:28:37.378
Now for an Indian,

00:28:38.489 --> 00:28:42.423
what is there to be happy if we buy an ashram in Brisbane?

00:28:44.945 --> 00:28:46.681
So overjoyed about it.

00:28:46.954 --> 00:28:51.080
To them Brisbane is the same as Bombay or Delhi.

00:28:56.438 --> 00:28:58.986
The Heart has become so large,

00:28:59.474 --> 00:29:02.887
because Shiva is shining there, the Spirit is shining.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.477
It has become such a large Heart

00:29:05.644 --> 00:29:10.815
that it encompasses the whole universe,
I think, the way people look at it,

00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:15.441
that's why you all have become universal people.

00:29:16.156 --> 00:29:22.362
You don't only read about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.529
you don't only knowabout it through your mind,

00:29:27.955 --> 00:29:33.022
you don't only try to follow it,
but you have imbibed it within yourself,

00:29:33.862 --> 00:29:37.195
which is so Sahaj, which you are not aware of it,

00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:40.520
how in a Sahaj way it has come to you.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.781
Now you know Australia was full of racialism once upon a time,

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.427
nobody was come, allowed to come in here,

00:29:50.153 --> 00:29:55.062
might be fifty years back or so, but today in Australia

00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:57.335
what a change it is!

00:29:58.719 --> 00:30:02.786
Though they talked of Christianity and all those things, but

00:30:04.003 --> 00:30:06.963
they didn’t think what Christ has said,

00:30:07.485 --> 00:30:11.485
they were just the opposite of what Christianity should be.

00:30:14.412 --> 00:30:18.146
Islam is the same, Islam talks of very great things,

00:30:19.777 --> 00:30:25.542
but it has to be confessed that
the Muslims have nothing to do with Islam.

00:30:26.676 --> 00:30:30.403
Is absolutely from outside, if you see Christianity

00:30:32.353 --> 00:30:35.549
you have a very, very funny idea about it.

00:30:35.754 --> 00:30:39.736
If you ask any Hindu gentleman about Christianity

00:30:41.562 --> 00:30:44.828
they will say they are the worst possible people,

00:30:46.017 --> 00:30:52.549
very cunning, very aggressive
and it takes them no time to kill each other.

00:30:54.482 --> 00:31:02.485
Imagine, disciples of Christ;
but if you ask a Christian about a Muslim

00:31:02.746 --> 00:31:09.200
he will tell you, “Oh, these Muslims
are the most quarrelsome, dirtiest people ever born,

00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:12.806
fundamentalist.” They are all fundamentalist,

00:31:12.943 --> 00:31:18.410
whether it's a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anyone,
they're fundamentalist because

00:31:19.156 --> 00:31:20.889
they are reading one book

00:31:22.126 --> 00:31:24.232
and that too, just reading.

00:31:24.392 --> 00:31:27.590
The book also doesn't go, if the book goes inside

00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:30.104
they will realize that all these books

00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:34.329
are telling the same thing under different names, that's all.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.525
But that universal thing you have got,

00:31:37.661 --> 00:31:41.752
thanks to your Spirit, that was there quite intact

00:31:41.933 --> 00:31:44.667
and which has started shining within you.

00:31:45.695 --> 00:31:50.649
So we have now a new community, a new civilization

00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:58.796
of people who are extremely honest with themselves,
honest to each other.

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:04.061
They are extremely righteous and good people,

00:32:04.855 --> 00:32:07.497
they are absolutely non-violent,

00:32:07.971 --> 00:32:14.971
absolutely law-abiding, very loving, affectionate,

00:32:15.388 --> 00:32:18.439
at the same time extremely constructive,

00:32:21.328 --> 00:32:27.087
and at the same time very intelligent.

00:32:28.969 --> 00:32:32.810
They understand Sahaja Yoga, it's such a subtle subject.

00:32:33.026 --> 00:32:35.559
Sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject,

00:32:35.668 --> 00:32:40.657
because you know everybody has failed to make people understand

00:32:41.145 --> 00:32:42.806
anything about truth.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:49.647
It’s an impossible situation. But this was the trick, your Spirit.

00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:55.316
Once your Spirit is enlightened it goes into your head

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.911
without any difficulties, absolutely Sahaj.

00:33:01.682 --> 00:33:06.407
You don't know how difficult is this subject of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:11.384 --> 00:33:15.681
It is such a fulfillment

00:33:19.848 --> 00:33:22.019
for the desire of the Divine

00:33:23.346 --> 00:33:26.849
that your  Divinity is now expressing itself.

00:33:28.822 --> 00:33:33.793
When you are collective, you are more enjoying each other,

00:33:34.077 --> 00:33:42.499
you enjoy collective life. Individualism is against

00:33:42.896 --> 00:33:45.006
the spirit of the whole,

00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:53.056
but we have our own varieties.

00:33:53.774 --> 00:33:58.965
The way you live in other countries, in other atmospheres,

00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:04.282
with other traditions, that's how you are living.

00:34:08.786 --> 00:34:15.897
But among ourselves we have the same faith,

00:34:17.552 --> 00:34:21.641
the faith which is enlightened, which is not blind faith,

00:34:21.915 --> 00:34:27.300
enlightened faith, firstly that you are realized souls,

00:34:27.693 --> 00:34:31.426
secondly that there is an all-pervading Power.

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:37.987
We have the same type of worship, whether it is Christ,

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:42.293
whether it is Mohammed Sahib or whether it is Shiva.

00:34:44.102 --> 00:34:49.092
We all worship it the same way, we do not have a sort of a

00:34:51.009 --> 00:34:53.075
difference of opinion on that,

00:34:55.192 --> 00:34:57.726
like one church becoming ten churches

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:03.258
and one Hinduism becoming ten Hinduisms. It's not like that.

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:11.122
We are all Sahaja Yogis and we have all got the same principle

00:35:11.689 --> 00:35:14.501
binding us in a Sahaj manner.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:19.316
We don't have to say, “Oh we have to be principled,

00:35:19.566 --> 00:35:23.233
we have to be on this principle, we are Sahaja Yogis.”

00:35:24.174 --> 00:35:29.447
You have to be there, absolutely, because you have to be there.

00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:33.073
You just can't help it,

00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:39.036
because in your nature now the Spirit is shining.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.837
Also, you are becoming archetypes,

00:35:46.962 --> 00:35:49.895
I should say, in the real sense of the word,

00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:53.437
for the people who are not in Sahaj.

00:35:55.989 --> 00:36:01.741
Such people are not available anywhere.

00:36:02.672 --> 00:36:08.848
When people will see you they will think that what a model it is,
what a model of life.

00:36:09.064 --> 00:36:11.783
They don't drink, they don't smoke,

00:36:11.908 --> 00:36:14.762
they don't boast of it, they don't hate anyone,

00:36:14.865 --> 00:36:20.499
they love anyone, they are so dynamic, they are so creative,

00:36:21.042 --> 00:36:26.320
they are so constructive, they are so self-contented.

00:36:27.737 --> 00:36:30.347
They are not at all competitive,

00:36:31.402 --> 00:36:37.093
they cause no problem to Nature, they cause no problem to anything.

00:36:41.146 --> 00:36:43.812
They have become such beautiful people.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.029
Who are these people?

00:36:47.034 --> 00:36:51.102
Such beautiful people are the models. So now,

00:36:51.386 --> 00:36:54.519
individually you have to understand this part,

00:36:54.663 --> 00:36:59.980
that we have to be models in this country of Australia.

00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:11.606
Model of good behavior, good language, decent life,

00:37:12.014 --> 00:37:16.830
decorous life, not fighting with husband,

00:37:16.945 --> 00:37:19.803
fighting with wife, you see you open any television,

00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:22.037
just get a headache, I mean there's, there's no other

00:37:22.116 --> 00:37:26.905
thing but a husband fighting wife and a wife fighting husband.

00:37:29.004 --> 00:37:31.651
There should be wisdom about it.

00:37:33.295 --> 00:37:37.629
Fighting among yourselves, you see if so many people have gather

00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:41.812
in a pub what will happen that pub will burst out.

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:46.462
They can never sit silently.

00:37:49.047 --> 00:37:52.786
The mayor of Cabella told Me, “It surprises me

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.677
that in the church we are sitting for half an hour then we start

00:37:57.939 --> 00:38:02.739
nudging each other. ‘How long
is it going to take now? Better get out.’

00:38:03.299 --> 00:38:08.299
You get tired; and what are
these people doing for hours together with You?

00:38:08.635 --> 00:38:12.651
How are they so spellbound? They don't feel tired.

00:38:14.779 --> 00:38:19.550
I think they are special people.” I said, “They are, they are.”

00:38:23.065 --> 00:38:26.872
“But what do they do?” “They don't do anything,

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:32.750
they are just enjoying.” He couldn't understand that

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:37.439
once we had a Puja, Guru Puja, for about six hours altogether,

00:38:37.645 --> 00:38:41.351
and they were surprised that how these people are sitting;

00:38:41.498 --> 00:38:46.597
and all the people they were,
all the villagers, mostly they are elderly,

00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:50.401
they thought that these angels have come from somewhere,

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.893
they are angelic people: they don't trouble you,

00:38:54.092 --> 00:38:57.196
they don't torture you, they look after you,

00:38:57.378 --> 00:39:04.191
they try to be kind to you, not only that but they try to

00:39:04.883 --> 00:39:13.287
bring joy to you. They were so surprised in that village.

00:39:14.164 --> 00:39:16.921
First they used to call Me “Princess”.

00:39:17.056 --> 00:39:19.702
Then they started calling Me “Goddess”,

00:39:19.827 --> 00:39:21.584
then they said,” You are Madonna.”

00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:25.542
Whatever they could think of the best, they started

00:39:26.121 --> 00:39:32.285
saying all those things. They want now to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:38.158
but I said, “Let us see now.”
After some time, we'll work it out for them also.

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:42.705
They are so nice now by seeing

00:39:42.933 --> 00:39:46.333
how the Sahaja Yogis are, because I seldom go out;

00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:49.272
but seeing the way Sahaja Yogis are,

00:39:49.465 --> 00:39:52.582
that the land behind the house

00:39:52.911 --> 00:39:56.880
was not even given to Prince Dorio
who was willing to pay lot of money,

00:39:57.004 --> 00:39:59.367
because he wanted to have a road that way;

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:03.043
but to Me they rushed forward

00:40:04.845 --> 00:40:08.822
and at a very nominal price they gave Me that land.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:12.269
They said, “It is for You only, please have it.”

00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:17.469
The whole village is getting into transformation.

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:25.632
But the dedication you have is very remarkable,

00:40:27.288 --> 00:40:30.097
surprises Me, really surprises Me.

00:40:31.707 --> 00:40:34.018
I have never taught you much,

00:40:35.005 --> 00:40:38.005
but the way you are dedicated in everything!

00:40:42.374 --> 00:40:47.077
Everyone who is not a Sahaja Yogi

00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:55.506
will be charmed the way you are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga, to Me.

00:40:56.775 --> 00:41:01.283
Sometimes I think, “What have I done? I have done nothing.”

00:41:01.612 --> 00:41:06.623
You had your Kundalini, you had your Spirit, that's all,

00:41:08.528 --> 00:41:15.942
but such a difference, with little distance you covered,

00:41:16.554 --> 00:41:18.595
and such a difference!

00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:23.735
Can you imagine an Indian woman coming to Australia,

00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:29.932
finding this love, this affection and this dedication?
Unbelievable!

00:41:34.411 --> 00:41:37.866
They all think that I must be mesmerizing you.

00:41:38.467 --> 00:41:42.145
Nobody can believe that you could be that dedicated,

00:41:42.281 --> 00:41:44.977
take so much trouble, so much care;

00:41:45.193 --> 00:41:47.934
I mean just imagine the flowers that you have brought,

00:41:48.053 --> 00:41:50.179
just imagine all this you have done,

00:41:50.258 --> 00:41:52.852
I mean just imagine the way they brought another

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:57.353
big car so that your Mother should be
brought here without any difficulty.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:58.725
All this love,

00:42:00.755 --> 00:42:06.671
all this affection, this care, I never asked for anything.

00:42:06.954 --> 00:42:08.810
I could have walked down,

00:42:08.904 --> 00:42:12.733
if you had said we have to walk,
I would have walked, I would never have said no.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:15.325
I never expected all this thing.

00:42:16.312 --> 00:42:19.883
But the way you want to express your love to Me,

00:42:19.986 --> 00:42:27.219
this dedication is so much and you sacrifice so much for that.

00:42:28.297 --> 00:42:31.159
Really you are sacrificing quite a lot,

00:42:33.903 --> 00:42:40.898
your time, your effort, to come
all the way to this far-off place for this Puja.

00:42:43.584 --> 00:42:47.471
All the gain that you have from Puja is only possible

00:42:47.743 --> 00:42:52.232
when you are a realized soul, otherwise it is useless

00:42:53.231 --> 00:42:57.845
to do any Puja, any worship. People go to church,

00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.832
sing few hymns and come back.

00:43:00.923 --> 00:43:04.457
They are just the same and afterwards go to the pub,

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:09.590
because they think pub is the only place
where they can get some joy.

00:43:10.267 --> 00:43:15.236
One has to exert, one has to sacrifice,

00:43:15.541 --> 00:43:18.044
though I may say that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest thing.

00:43:18.148 --> 00:43:22.116
You don't have to go to
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all that,

00:43:22.207 --> 00:43:28.409
but still you have to sacrifice your time, your attention.

00:43:29.536 --> 00:43:34.489
Formerly you might be going to some rock music,

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.868
you might be going to some pubs also,

00:43:39.048 --> 00:43:42.607
you might be enjoying all these things;
but you have given up everything,

00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:45.612
without My telling you, just have given up

00:43:45.693 --> 00:43:47.762
and you are so pure now.

00:43:48.533 --> 00:43:52.533
Your attention is so pure you can't enjoy all these things.

00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:58.178
Don't you think it's very remarkable that this has happened?

00:43:59.353 --> 00:44:02.947
This community, I don't have to tell you,

00:44:03.752 --> 00:44:07.684
I don't have to educate, I must say

00:44:07.843 --> 00:44:10.576
that all these things you have given up.

00:44:11.074 --> 00:44:15.471
Suddenly I find all of you have become so clean,

00:44:15.733 --> 00:44:18.612
so beautiful, your chakras so clean.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.185
Is it that these are your purva punyas that is working out?

00:44:28.841 --> 00:44:32.692
But still I would say you must know your self-esteem,

00:44:32.795 --> 00:44:36.795
that you are Sahaja Yogis, and how can you behave like this

00:44:36.899 --> 00:44:42.169
if you are a Sahaja Yogi? You cannot. Now you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:44:42.657 --> 00:44:47.577
so that dignity, that wisdom has to be there;

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:56.050
the compassion, the love, the unity of purpose should be there.

00:44:57.784 --> 00:45:01.280
All over the world you have brothers and sisters,

00:45:01.396 --> 00:45:05.942
this brotherhood and sisterhood is everywhere.

00:45:06.192 --> 00:45:10.531
You have rakhi sisters, you have very pure relationships.

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:15.372
Anything impure is just thrown out in a Sahaj manner.

00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:20.065
Those who do not fit into it just get out of it.

00:45:23.399 --> 00:45:28.940
We have now very beautiful families, very beautiful children,

00:45:29.904 --> 00:45:36.372
it's, just think of it.
Moses saved some Jews but what are they good for, nothing,

00:45:38.085 --> 00:45:41.201
what's the use of saving such people?

00:45:42.029 --> 00:45:47.754
Then Christ came and talked about this thing,

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:53.361
and this is what has happened to Christianity.

00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:58.526
Mohammed came and talked of very nice things, I must tell you.

00:45:58.654 --> 00:46:01.656
He never made it a rigid religion, never.

00:46:01.873 --> 00:46:05.704
It was very flexible, and He said, “You must get the knowledge.”

00:46:05.818 --> 00:46:08.593
So according to them, knowledge was to read the book

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.984
and to interpret it and to be an intellectual.

00:46:16.451 --> 00:46:20.100
After that came Guru Nanaka also, you know that.

00:46:20.339 --> 00:46:23.554
What has happened to Sikhs, where they have gone?

00:46:23.679 --> 00:46:26.346
“Sikh” means the person who has learnt,

00:46:26.745 --> 00:46:28.874
learnt the Divine laws.

00:46:29.963 --> 00:46:34.353
If I say you have to follow the Divine laws, how?
You are not connected,

00:46:34.602 --> 00:46:37.357
you don't know what are the Divine laws are.

00:46:37.482 --> 00:46:40.549
Just follow: “We want to follow Divine laws.”

00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:44.067
Now you are hanging somewhere on this earth,

00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:46.764
the Divine laws are working there,

00:46:46.912 --> 00:46:49.347
how are you going to work out the Divine laws

00:46:49.443 --> 00:46:51.176
if you are not connected?

00:46:51.653 --> 00:46:55.053
But you know immediately what are the Divine laws;

00:46:55.192 --> 00:46:58.062
you are going against it, as soon as you go against it

00:46:58.153 --> 00:47:01.953
you know you can feel it on your central nervous system.

00:47:02.132 --> 00:47:08.139
You can feel it on your hands,
that you are doing something against the Divine laws.

00:47:09.102 --> 00:47:12.297
Immediately you know and if you are alert

00:47:12.389 --> 00:47:16.357
you'll immediately try to change. You'll think,

00:47:17.355 --> 00:47:22.962
“That's not correct, this is the truth about myself.”

00:47:23.098 --> 00:47:25.635
You start judging yourself all the time

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:31.225
and you want to put yourself right
because you don't like it that way.

00:47:32.813 --> 00:47:37.288
So many ideas you have about your personal life

00:47:38.104 --> 00:47:40.641
are that, you see, there should be

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:45.316
“a wife who should spoil me” or “a husband who should spoil me”,

00:47:45.408 --> 00:47:49.141
“My child should be like this”, and - all finished now.

00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:53.524
What do you want? “I want a real Sahaja Yogini”,

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.926
“I want a real Sahaja Yogi to marry”,

00:47:57.052 --> 00:48:00.252
and after that the marriage becomes a blessing.

00:48:00.578 --> 00:48:05.906
How? How these flowers have come out, that's how.

00:48:07.653 --> 00:48:11.233
It's all innately built within you, all this beauty.

00:48:11.358 --> 00:48:18.416
You just start showing, but it has to sprout, it has to come up.

00:48:25.526 --> 00:48:31.122
This penance, so-called, is no penance to you.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.727
They say “We are enjoying this place”, I mean it's a

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:38.739
place for penance only, the way things are here,

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.365
there are not even closed bathrooms.

00:48:43.932 --> 00:48:47.932
People are finding it rather difficult to take a bath even.

00:48:48.858 --> 00:48:55.114
It's quite a penance to come to such a far-fetched place,

00:48:55.398 --> 00:48:59.284
or to travel in Maharashtra is another big penance.

00:48:59.431 --> 00:49:04.588
But you enjoy it, I mean you were missing; they said,
“We are missing our buses.” I said, “Really?

00:49:07.102 --> 00:49:12.612
I thought you would be happy. “No, no, Mother we are missing.”
I mean it was an adventure for them,

00:49:12.853 --> 00:49:19.313
they liked the way they were jostled and they were given hiccups,

00:49:19.472 --> 00:49:21.248
they’re very happy about it,

00:49:21.351 --> 00:49:24.727
that all this was, this was like an adventure.

00:49:24.988 --> 00:49:27.811
Everything which we call as tapasya

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:31.584
or as the penance becomes an adventure for them,

00:49:31.687 --> 00:49:34.820
and the way they describe is very interesting.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.532
Like these musicians, they went to Russia and got lost,

00:49:38.657 --> 00:49:44.724
and when they came back, and they were describing the
whole thing with such description,

00:49:45.369 --> 00:49:49.199
as if God was just taking them from places to places.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:54.367
And how they were helped every moment, how they came

00:49:54.583 --> 00:49:59.310
to Italy sudden and how they came to Milan, to the ashram.

00:49:59.515 --> 00:50:02.596
The whole description is tremendous.

00:50:05.215 --> 00:50:11.953
Now think of what you have achieved, but you can't even think,

00:50:12.713 --> 00:50:14.195
you just achieve.

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:23.414
Without thinking you achieve things,
is the blessing of your Spirit, blessing of Shiva.

00:50:24.537 --> 00:50:29.694
The Spirit is the witness and you develop that witness state.

00:50:30.715 --> 00:50:34.862
To you all this looks like a funny stage

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:37.889
where people are doing this and that, politics, economics,

00:50:38.015 --> 00:50:40.405
you see as something absurd.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:44.926
I went down to Russia, there were so many Russians.

00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:50.002
I told them that there's a very bad shape the politics is here now

00:50:50.138 --> 00:50:52.868
and you are having very bad times with your food.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:56.564
“No, Mother, we have no problem with food or anything,

00:50:56.688 --> 00:51:00.529
but what do we care? We have got the spiritual food,

00:51:00.802 --> 00:51:04.971
let these people fight, do whatever, we are not bothered.”

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:11.696
They were least bothered as there was a coup or anything,
least bothered.

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.388
“Let them fight, let them do what they like,

00:51:15.557 --> 00:51:19.474
we are in a different situation.”

00:51:19.667 --> 00:51:23.686
I said, “Which situation you are?” “We are in the Kingdom of God,”

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.021
they told Me,

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:32.151
“We are in the Kingdom of God, why should we worry
about these kingdoms and things, let them fight.”

00:51:32.312 --> 00:51:36.674
Such contented people, so very beautiful.

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:40.033
You have so many brothers and sisters there.

00:51:40.147 --> 00:51:44.058
Early in the morning I got up and they had, I don't know when,

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:49.791
planted flowers on the road of My house there,

00:51:51.798 --> 00:51:54.859
flowers all along, rows after rows.

00:51:55.018 --> 00:51:59.914
I don't know when they came, when they did it and disappeared.

00:52:00.221 --> 00:52:04.243
So sweet, I tell you, except for

00:52:05.593 --> 00:52:09.300
crying with joy  I didn't know what to say.

00:52:10.021 --> 00:52:11.860
If this happens all over,

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.594
what a world we can have.

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:19.435
There are of course some people who are exceptional,
who are troublesome,

00:52:19.572 --> 00:52:25.919
who are not all right; it's all right, forget about them.

00:52:30.228 --> 00:52:40.583
So now, you are the people who have understood what is God,

00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:48.426
what is Sadashiva. Now you have faith in Him which is not blind,

00:52:48.801 --> 00:52:51.656
you also know that His powers work,

00:52:51.985 --> 00:52:56.585
that His laws work, all other laws are useless,
only His laws works.

00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:04.545
You have seen, experienced in your lifetime

00:53:04.897 --> 00:53:09.169
how miracles are taking place, how things are working out.

00:53:09.317 --> 00:53:12.548
A simple miracle I would say, it was desired

00:53:12.696 --> 00:53:16.426
that Shiva Puja should be around some hills,

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:19.155
but they couldn't arrange,

00:53:19.292 --> 00:53:24.778
they were trying for some other place
which could not be arranged, so you are here.

00:53:24.994 --> 00:53:30.708
You desire and it works, as if your desire acts.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:37.009
But we have some people who are still mediocre,

00:53:37.179 --> 00:53:39.928
who are behaving in a mediocre manner,

00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:43.107
very dull, some of them are very dull people.

00:53:43.477 --> 00:53:45.477
They cannot understand Sahaj,

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:49.761
they don't understand how much they can gain out of it.

00:53:50.045 --> 00:53:53.273
So you shouldn't worry about them.

00:53:54.475 --> 00:53:59.124
Then you have to think about the whole collective which is good

00:53:59.385 --> 00:54:02.718
and one or two useless people, forget about them.

00:54:03.204 --> 00:54:06.149
If they come up well and good, if they don't come up,

00:54:06.274 --> 00:54:08.757
we are not going to force them.

00:54:09.348 --> 00:54:14.084
We'll be getting more and more people, more and more people.

00:54:15.173 --> 00:54:18.017
I'm sure it will happen.

00:54:19.014 --> 00:54:23.281
But the greatest thing you have got is the complete integration

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:31.893
within your being: your heart, your mind,

00:54:34.297 --> 00:54:39.589
your liver I should say, your attention, are all integrated.

00:54:40.712 --> 00:54:43.699
There's no quarrel, there's no struggle

00:54:44.519 --> 00:54:51.057
between your heart and your mind, heart and your brain.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:56.782
Whatever your brain thinks, your heart accepts,

00:54:57.065 --> 00:55:01.231
whatever your heart wants, your brain accepts,

00:55:01.424 --> 00:55:07.093
whatever your attention is there, is completely integrated

00:55:07.839 --> 00:55:11.558
with your heart and with your brain.

00:55:13.282 --> 00:55:17.482
You must see the other people, they don't want to do something

00:55:18.247 --> 00:55:21.770
but they have to do it because they’re habituated.

00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:25.511
So many people told Me: “We want to give up this, we can't.”

00:55:25.636 --> 00:55:29.374
Once you have got the Spirit, you get that power

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.313
that you can surpass all the said temptations,

00:55:33.434 --> 00:55:37.139
not only temptations, also the differentiations

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:40.232
that you always make: “This is that, this is that.”

00:55:40.358 --> 00:55:46.026
But you integrate, you integrate among yourselves,

00:55:46.707 --> 00:55:49.516
you integrate among different states,

00:55:49.641 --> 00:55:52.677
you integrate among different countries.

00:55:54.435 --> 00:55:59.080
The whole cosmos seems to be integrated, woven

00:55:59.818 --> 00:56:05.591
and governed by the Divine laws.

00:56:08.176 --> 00:56:15.285
This integration gives you a complete understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:18.152 --> 00:56:26.393
mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:35.802
It’s not by some sort of a brain-washing

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:42.795
or bombarding, but just through the light of Spirit
you have seen the truth

00:56:43.895 --> 00:56:48.847
and you have understood it. Also you have so many powers.

00:56:49.981 --> 00:56:54.181
You do not want to exert, that's a different point altogether,

00:56:54.618 --> 00:56:56.148
but just try.

00:56:58.428 --> 00:57:03.493
One word of prayer from you is very powerful

00:57:03.518 --> 00:57:07.405
than hundreds of prayers of these people.

00:57:11.113 --> 00:57:15.874
One asking is much more powerful

00:57:16.835 --> 00:57:19.406
than thousands of these askings.

00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:22.591
You have never tried that; try that,

00:57:23.124 --> 00:57:27.057
you are extremely powerful, whatever you desire works out.

00:57:30.391 --> 00:57:33.915
You have other powers of giving Realization,

00:57:34.233 --> 00:57:36.700
also curing, you have so many powers

00:57:37.295 --> 00:57:40.928
but most of the time you'll bring somebody to Me to be cured.

00:57:41.133 --> 00:57:43.740
No, no, there's no need.

00:57:44.058 --> 00:57:48.191
You have given all powers; you have all the powers, use them.

00:57:48.968 --> 00:57:53.546
Don't be afraid, use these powers, and you will be amazed

00:57:54.102 --> 00:57:56.419
how these power work out,

00:57:57.916 --> 00:58:07.739
and how you become more and more embedded in your faith,
in yourself.

00:58:10.675 --> 00:58:13.246
Of course there are Sahaja Yogis

00:58:13.564 --> 00:58:17.215
who are made to sit on the throne but still they are begging,

00:58:17.306 --> 00:58:19.511
what can you do about it?

00:58:22.051 --> 00:58:27.073
You are so very powerful in collective and also individually.

00:58:29.512 --> 00:58:32.367
Whatever you want, you can have it.

00:58:33.286 --> 00:58:36.726
I am desireless because the Divine,

00:58:37.911 --> 00:58:44.040
the Divine power is working for Me, everything
- I don't have to desire - it knows.

00:58:45.344 --> 00:58:48.611
I don't desire anything, but you have to desire,

00:58:50.372 --> 00:58:54.024
you have to pray, you have to ask.

00:58:54.342 --> 00:58:58.184
And the wider you become your prayers will be wider,

00:58:58.332 --> 00:59:01.211
for a wider world, wider vision,

00:59:01.642 --> 00:59:04.978
not limited to your children, not limited to your family,

00:59:05.069 --> 00:59:10.919
not limited to one place, but unlimited areas you'll cover.

00:59:17.092 --> 00:59:21.786
So we become very conscious and alert

00:59:22.331 --> 00:59:27.249
about whatever is happening in the world
to put our attention there.

00:59:27.408 --> 00:59:31.827
We try to find out what's wrong with this
and what's wrong with that.

00:59:31.964 --> 00:59:34.977
We are not just worried about a small little ashram,

00:59:35.079 --> 00:59:39.319
but we are worried about the whole world to find out what's wrong,

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.503
what can we do, what can we desire,

00:59:41.583 --> 00:59:47.852
because if we have the power,
and if we can operate the Divine power,

00:59:49.097 --> 00:59:52.646
then why not we work it out ourselves? We can.

00:59:52.964 --> 00:59:55.738
So your attention can go to any place.

00:59:55.819 --> 00:59:57.689
It can go to Nicaragua,

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:07.642
it can go to Israel, it can go to Saddam Hussein,
to any place that you want to work it out.

01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:10.829
It moves, it's mobile, it's universal.

01:00:12.168 --> 01:00:19.101
Just start expanding your heart, your mind and your attention.

01:00:24.949 --> 01:00:31.669
Your faith in Me, I must say, is great.
I am Myself surprised at that.

01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:41.374
I am quite a camouflage.

01:00:42.622 --> 01:00:46.555
It's not easy to understand Me, I don't understand Myself!

01:00:53.969 --> 01:00:58.348
On one side of course I'm Divine, no doubt,

01:01:00.083 --> 01:01:03.130
on the other side, I am very human.

01:01:04.287 --> 01:01:10.135
Even in a film, if I see somebody suffering,
I start crying, can't bear.

01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:15.046
I can't cure children because I can't see their sufferings.

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:20.799
It's another aspect of Mine. I’ve made Myself extremely human,

01:01:25.142 --> 01:01:31.402
and this Divinity of Mine also is just Sahaj.

01:01:32.842 --> 01:01:34.374
I've done nothing,

01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:39.556
I've been like this and I'm like this, I've not achieved anything.

01:01:39.851 --> 01:01:43.918
If I've achieved anything, is understanding of human beings,

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.318
because I always felt that all these Incarnations

01:01:48.488 --> 01:01:53.712
and all these prophets never understood human beings.

01:01:53.883 --> 01:01:57.497
They never knew that they are not enlightened people

01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:01.817
and no use talking to them of these great things, it’s all a waste.

01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:03.697
It's like a blind person,

01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:08.294
you explain to him all the colors and the beauty of the stage.

01:02:12.745 --> 01:02:24.425
And so this human realization,
I should, that I had, is so beautiful.

01:02:26.908 --> 01:02:30.583
Now I understand what is the joy of bhakti,

01:02:31.605 --> 01:02:34.969
what is the joy of gnyana,

01:02:36.466 --> 01:02:43.110
what is the joy of karma, because a person
who doesn't do anything,

01:02:44.405 --> 01:02:53.571
a person who has no bhakti and who has no gnyana

01:02:58.436 --> 01:03:00.912
is just wakened completely.

01:03:03.294 --> 01:03:06.266
I had to fill in Myself with all these things

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:08.998
that I have to know the gnyana,

01:03:09.135 --> 01:03:12.862
not the gnyana of the Divine because after all that is,

01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:18.814
that is not difficult, because if I am that, I know that,

01:03:19.348 --> 01:03:22.278
but the gnyana of the human beings,

01:03:23.877 --> 01:03:29.648
the problems of the human beings, I had to study for years

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:35.235
the human beings to work it out.

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:39.031
But once it has worked,

01:03:41.072 --> 01:03:46.472
that's what is said that there is Divinity in
you has started expressing itself,

01:03:47.659 --> 01:03:51.795
and such beautiful Divine lights are sitting before Me.

01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:59.208
I bless you all from My heart where resides the Shiva,
the Sadashiva,

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:02.233
and Sadashiva blesses you.

01:04:02.777 --> 01:04:07.151
He is a innocent personality, absolutely innocent.

01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:14.444
He is the One who is beyond any attachments,

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:20.791
absolutely beyond any attachments.

01:04:22.272 --> 01:04:30.026
He is the One who is watching,
watching all of you with such admiration,

01:04:31.217 --> 01:04:40.657
His joy knows no bounds, it's tremendous,
as if He is dancing with joy.

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:50.045
It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here.

01:04:50.431 --> 01:04:54.828
I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you,

01:04:54.941 --> 01:04:57.112
that's the most important.

01:04:57.396 --> 01:05:05.400
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates in your being,

01:05:05.718 --> 01:05:10.731
because the Spirit has awakened in your attention,

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:14.028
in your central nervous system.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:17.410
That's the most important thing you have to do.

01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:21.046
The rest of it is Sahaj.

01:05:23.078 --> 01:05:25.787
The rest of it is absolutely Sahaj.

01:05:26.205 --> 01:05:28.305
May God bless you all.
