00:00.530 --> 00:09.800
Yesterday I told you about the Void, the dharma,
which one has to establish.

00:09.800 --> 00:18.330
In modern times, people have used their freedom
to such an extent, you see, they have moved

00:18.330 --> 00:21.500
so much to this extreme or to that extreme.

00:21.500 --> 00:30.450
They have left their central path and have
accepted and identified themselves with such

00:30.450 --> 00:40.920
an extreme ideas about everything, that it
is rather difficult to convince people that

00:40.920 --> 00:43.890
they have lost their way.

00:43.890 --> 00:47.559
All extremes are wrong.

00:47.559 --> 00:53.210
Moderation is the way we really solve the
problem.

00:53.210 --> 00:57.789
But human race is such that everybody starts
running very fast, you see, and there’s

00:57.789 --> 00:59.699
a competition set in: who goes first to hell.

00:59.699 --> 01:03.329
[Laughter, She laughs]

01:03.329 --> 01:11.909
It’s not only in one direction, you can
take up any direction, but all these directions

01:11.909 --> 01:19.120
are linear.

01:19.120 --> 01:30.780
They move straightforward and coil back and
go down – any movement of that kind.

01:30.780 --> 01:37.420
For example take our, say, industrial development.

01:37.420 --> 01:44.000
We started our industrial development without
understanding the whole, the world as a whole,

01:44.000 --> 01:51.210
that the whole world was created by God, not
a part, one country.

01:51.210 --> 01:55.560
Without understanding the relationship with
the whole, when we start moving industrially,

01:55.560 --> 02:00.329
we created industries, and to pamper them
we had to create other industries.

02:00.329 --> 02:11.460
Then also to keep the hungry machines working
out, we had to feed them with something.

02:11.460 --> 02:22.670
And thus we created a horrible system of extracting
things from the Mother Earth, using them.

02:22.670 --> 02:29.040
We have so many things, but we do not have
the thing which is your Spirit.

02:29.040 --> 02:37.780
We never thought that, after all, all this
matter is for what?

02:37.780 --> 02:39.019
All these things are for what?

02:39.019 --> 02:40.019
For comfort?

02:40.019 --> 02:46.780
That also, if not done in moderation, we are
going to be ruined, completely ruined.

02:46.780 --> 02:54.540
We’ll become like worms.

02:54.540 --> 02:59.590
The Mother Earth is available to you, that
doesn’t mean that you should be indiscriminate

02:59.590 --> 03:01.819
and use it for your comfort.

03:01.819 --> 03:07.780
She’s there for your comfort, no doubt,
She’s the comforting element we have got,

03:07.780 --> 03:09.599
the greatest comforting element.

03:09.599 --> 03:14.659
But we do not know how to use Her for our
comfort.

03:14.659 --> 03:23.680
The way we use Her is by taking out, extracting
Her.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.820
Now if I say that, the other extreme would
be: “We’ll have no possessions, nothing,

03:27.820 --> 03:30.390
live, hang by the string, some shoestring
somewhere”.

03:30.390 --> 03:36.910
[She laughs] There are people who believe
in such a thing also, who want to live on

03:36.910 --> 03:49.739
a shoestring and have all kinds of diseases,
physical, mental, because they are living

03:49.739 --> 03:55.450
abnormally, in such a way that they do not
relate themselves to the Mother Earth at all.

03:55.450 --> 04:03.100
Either you abstract completely whatever She
has, or take away all Her flesh, blood, everything,

04:03.100 --> 04:07.040
and otherwise you have nothing to do.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.800
These are two extremes!

04:09.800 --> 04:18.889
And once you start doing like that, you find
that you become slave to both ways, because

04:18.889 --> 04:25.130
you start forming habits with the help of
this matter.

04:25.130 --> 04:31.200
Habit formation is slavery, complete slavery,
even a habit formation like fasting.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.090
Now some people have to fast.

04:33.090 --> 04:36.160
Who has asked them to fast I don’t know.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.000
What is the need to fast for people who are
already suffering from liver troubles and

04:40.000 --> 04:42.280
thin like sticks?

04:42.280 --> 04:48.139
It’s all right, somebody has to fast because,
supposing he has too much weight, or say they

04:48.139 --> 04:50.610
want some rest to the stomach, is all right.

04:50.610 --> 04:57.710
But this fasting also can become such a habit,
such a habit, that the day you do not fast

04:57.710 --> 04:58.740
you’ll say, “Oh!

04:58.740 --> 05:01.180
You have done the greatest crime on the Earth.

05:01.180 --> 05:05.130
Oh God, I did not fast on Thursday, I should
have fasted."

05:05.130 --> 05:07.360
In India we get so many mad people like that.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.669
[Laughter] They go crazy because they have
not fasted.

05:10.669 --> 05:14.930
There are some who get crazy because they
have not eaten their food.

05:14.930 --> 05:18.590
I mean they are all right, but if they have
not taken their lunch, for them it’s the

05:18.590 --> 05:26.930
greatest injury, the greatest injustice done
to them that they have not been able to take

05:26.930 --> 05:28.950
their lunch.

05:28.950 --> 05:38.940
The matter starts enslaving you and your mind
becomes a slave of that matter.

05:38.940 --> 05:46.160
You do not know in what way this Mother Earth,
which is there to give you the ultimate, She’s

05:46.160 --> 05:51.720
the one who resides within you at the Mooladhara
Chakra to give you the innocence.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.770
She gives you the innocence.

05:54.770 --> 06:02.830
Instead of taking that essence of Hers, the
innocence, what you take is the matter which

06:02.830 --> 06:03.830
is dead.

06:03.830 --> 06:09.460
The living principle of Mother Earth is innocence,
Her magnetism, Her gravity.

06:09.460 --> 06:19.930
Instead of that, what do you take out of Her
is this matter.

06:19.930 --> 06:24.319
Either you run away from it, or you run towards
it.

06:24.319 --> 06:26.430
Nothing in between.

06:26.430 --> 06:35.090
Now matter is there for you to use, no doubt;
but to use so that you do not get dominated

06:35.090 --> 06:39.710
by it, because you are the supreme thing God
has created.

06:39.710 --> 06:44.169
You are the supreme-most thing; all the elements
are working in you.

06:44.169 --> 06:50.979
There’s no animal in the world who has all
these elements working in such a beautiful

06:50.979 --> 07:00.340
fashion that you develop your own will, your
own freedom.

07:00.340 --> 07:08.120
It’s such a intricate process which has
worked out a human being, which we don’t

07:08.120 --> 07:15.250
realize, where you develop your own will,
your own freedom.

07:15.250 --> 07:24.460
But again, with your own will what do you
do is to lose your freedom all the time.

07:24.460 --> 07:28.960
For example, take a person who indulges in
luxuries.

07:28.960 --> 07:35.919
I mean he is idiotic sometimes, I mean he
really becomes an idiot the way he goes on.

07:35.919 --> 07:38.440
I mean you can see that he’s an idiot and
stupid fellow.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.979
The another one, he will say that this luxury
is – indulgence fellow is very, very idiotic

07:41.979 --> 07:42.979
and stupid you can see.

07:42.979 --> 07:44.229
So he says, “All right, let me give it up."

07:44.229 --> 07:49.789
He goes to another extreme, to such an extreme
that he becomes a dry person, absolutely dry.

07:49.789 --> 07:54.910
The innocence is in the centre.

07:54.910 --> 08:01.090
For example, the best use of the Mother Earth
is to watch Her working.

08:01.090 --> 08:03.259
Watch the nature.

08:03.259 --> 08:06.319
Watch every tree, what beautiful personality
every tree has.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.810
Every leaf of the tree stands against the
sky.

08:09.810 --> 08:15.879
I mean it’s such a poetry to feel Her with
your feet.

08:15.879 --> 08:19.169
How soft She is when She produces flowers
for you.

08:19.169 --> 08:23.000
You have to learn so much from what She does.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.879
She creates a flower to emit fragrance, to
give, to give, to give.

08:29.879 --> 08:33.710
She just gives.

08:33.710 --> 08:39.450
Her innocence doesn’t bother as to what
you are, whether you deserve it or not, whether

08:39.450 --> 08:43.990
you are a good person or a bad person or what
use you are going to put Her resources, She

08:43.990 --> 08:45.910
just gives.

08:45.910 --> 08:51.820
She doesn’t judge you.

08:51.820 --> 08:56.250
Nirvaj – it flows.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.740
The capital flows without any interest.

08:58.740 --> 09:07.190
It just goes on flowing and flowing and that’s
the word of nirvaj is.

09:07.190 --> 09:15.010
It doesn’t think to whom She is giving to,
whether they deserve it or not, if they are

09:15.010 --> 09:17.840
sinners or they are this or that.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.440
But now it is for you to use your wisdom.

09:22.440 --> 09:31.140
And She has created this deity [Ganesha] of
wisdom within you, and you have to keep that

09:31.140 --> 09:32.350
deity awakened.

09:32.350 --> 09:37.480
He came, incarnated on this Earth as Jesus
Christ.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.340
Look at Him.

09:40.340 --> 09:44.140
Look at His life.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.990
How He lived.

09:46.990 --> 09:57.440
He was a carpenter’s son; He lived like
a carpenter’s son.

09:57.440 --> 10:01.240
He didn’t amass money.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.250
And what a dynamic life in thirty years of
His age!

10:04.250 --> 10:09.480
What a dynamic life, out of which He spent
only four years in the public.

10:09.480 --> 10:15.830
With all our indulgences and with all our
comforts, with all our movements and aeroplanes

10:15.830 --> 10:21.640
and all this, how many there are who have
created such a dynamic life?

10:21.640 --> 10:29.260
What dynamism have we been able to show, the
dynamism of the Mother Earth.

10:29.260 --> 10:37.880
“We must have this, we must have that, we
must get this, we must enjoy this,” All

10:37.880 --> 10:38.980
right.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.160
But what is the ultimate?

10:40.160 --> 10:46.630
I mean how much we have been able to absorb
it and what have we – giving others, what

10:46.630 --> 10:48.170
is our fruit of this tree that we are?

10:48.170 --> 10:55.640
The reason is, we have lacked wisdom.

10:55.640 --> 10:56.850
He was wisdom.

10:56.850 --> 11:02.930
He is the One who emits wisdom, who balances
our ego, superego, everything.

11:02.930 --> 11:06.630
You know where He stands, that Deity.

11:06.630 --> 11:13.190
But the people who followed Him, or who called
themselves Christians, where is the wisdom

11:13.190 --> 11:14.360
gone?

11:14.360 --> 11:20.880
Wisdom is one thing lacking in all of them.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.360
What is the reason?

11:24.360 --> 11:29.640
Because we just thought that He was crucified
because He was a poor Man?

11:29.640 --> 11:32.410
Or I don’t know what we thought of Him.

11:32.410 --> 11:36.690
I can’t understand human beings, what is
the lesson we have taken from His life?

11:36.690 --> 11:41.210
And the Christian nations have advanced so
much materially.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.200
Can you imagine?

11:43.200 --> 11:52.210
They do not know that poverty is such a blissful
thing sometimes.

11:52.210 --> 11:55.230
And then now a reaction has started.

11:55.230 --> 11:59.360
I’m sure reaction will also take you to
another extreme, you’ll miss the point.

11:59.360 --> 12:04.070
It’s like a madman running to one end and
when he goes from there he runs to another

12:04.070 --> 12:05.070
end.

12:05.070 --> 12:06.620
Have you ever seen a wild boar running?

12:06.620 --> 12:09.130
Have you ever seen a wild boar running?

12:09.130 --> 12:15.340
You see, it’s very easy to get out of the
way of a wild boar because he just runs straightforward,

12:15.340 --> 12:17.500
till he meets some opposition.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.500
Straightforward.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.500
He wouldn’t see this side, that side.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.570
If you can just keep away from the line from
where he’s moving he will not hit you.

12:22.570 --> 12:25.580
Then again he comes back in the same way.

12:25.580 --> 12:28.330
Goes this way, comes back.

12:28.330 --> 12:32.040
[Laughter]That is our movement has been about
ourselves.

12:32.040 --> 12:37.830
What have we done out of our life?

12:37.830 --> 12:39.450
Let’s see.

12:39.450 --> 12:47.130
While we are capable, we are the seeds which
are going to render the real fruits.

12:47.130 --> 12:52.380
We are capable, you know now that.

12:52.380 --> 12:57.270
And that is why first of all we have done
the greatest harm to ourselves by ruining

12:57.270 --> 12:59.250
all our sustenance within ourselves.

12:59.250 --> 13:06.450
As I told you the other day in the lecture,
that how we have to maintain our sustenance.

13:06.450 --> 13:17.350
I hope it was not too much for you to – if
you feel that I was trying to tell the people

13:17.350 --> 13:23.390
also they say, a group of people who think
this is all conditioning.

13:23.390 --> 13:31.370
Actually, we are so confused in modern times
about everything.

13:31.370 --> 13:39.250
Supposing a plane has to take off, all its
parts are to be in a proper proportion, are

13:39.250 --> 13:44.790
to be tied together to the main body.

13:44.790 --> 13:48.030
Otherwise everything will go helter-skelter,
isn’t it?

13:48.030 --> 13:58.430
Now if you have to jump into your unconscious,
all your parts of the being should be attached

13:58.430 --> 14:08.650
to the gravity of the body, to your sustenance,
otherwise you’ll go helter-skelter.

14:08.650 --> 14:15.790
Will you say that a – putting the plane
in that way is conditioning it, for its freedom?

14:15.790 --> 14:22.720
You have much more freedom when it is properly
done.

14:22.720 --> 14:28.700
A person who is properly prepared for this
flight, has much more freedom than people

14:28.700 --> 14:32.710
who think that one nose is lying this, and
ears are lying on the other side, then eyes

14:32.710 --> 14:35.950
are going on the other side, his mind is going
on the third side, his stomach is going on

14:35.950 --> 14:36.950
the other side.

14:36.950 --> 14:37.950
[Laughter]

14:37.950 --> 14:43.420
Here he is listening to Me and he’s thinking
of his food.

14:43.420 --> 14:48.070
His eyes are looking at something else.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.720
His feet are moving.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.050
He’s jumpy.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.710
There’s no proper binding.

14:54.710 --> 15:08.840
And that’s why the conditioning has a word
in Sanskrit language as samskara.

15:08.840 --> 15:09.930
Samskar.

15:09.930 --> 15:20.810
Now “sam” means “good, beautiful,”
or you can say “which are good to your Spirit."

15:20.810 --> 15:29.040
Even to add to that they can say “susamskara,”
means “good conditionings,” where you

15:29.040 --> 15:31.810
are to be chiselled out.

15:31.810 --> 15:48.180
And in that chiselling, if you understand
it is for not only your good, but for your

15:48.180 --> 15:49.180
flight, then you do not give everything to
the winds.

15:49.180 --> 15:58.980
And this is the biggest mistake we have committed,
when we started on the flight of our freedom.

15:58.980 --> 16:02.910
How can you have your freedom when you are
bound by everything?

16:02.910 --> 16:06.930
You must go to the pub in the evening.

16:06.930 --> 16:09.910
You must go for your dancing [Laughter].

16:09.910 --> 16:14.279
You must see a friend who smokes and must
smoke with him.

16:14.279 --> 16:18.790
You have to attend a party where you have
to drink.

16:18.790 --> 16:21.370
You must sleep at some particular time.

16:21.370 --> 16:24.510
Because you cannot sleep, so you must take
pills.

16:24.510 --> 16:32.560
You have to have girlfriends or boyfriends,
spend money on their – I don’t know what

16:32.560 --> 16:34.980
you call – dates, and things like that.

16:34.980 --> 16:39.900
I mean, how frivolous the whole thing sounds
to Me.

16:39.900 --> 16:41.230
Same thing in India.

16:41.230 --> 16:50.890
I mean they have other frivolities.

16:50.890 --> 16:56.110
But when you understand through your Self
Realization your self-esteem, then you try

16:56.110 --> 17:01.100
to think: “Then what have I done of my life?”

17:01.100 --> 17:07.170
You are like diamonds thrown into dust.

17:07.170 --> 17:12.190
You must find out your relative relationship
with all these useless things where the money

17:12.190 --> 17:20.670
is wasted, you are frittered away, your time
is wasted, everything wasted, just find out.

17:20.670 --> 17:26.670
Once you discover that, then you start detaching
yourself from that.

17:26.670 --> 17:31.419
But first and foremost thing I’m sorry to
say – it is may call conditioning or anything

17:31.419 --> 17:43.740
– are these important things are, ten things
I told you the other time.

17:43.740 --> 17:51.480
Now all the gurus, all the gurus who came,
say from we can start from Socrates, then

17:51.480 --> 18:01.910
Abraham, Moses – this is the Guru Tattwa,
is the principle of master, primordial masters.

18:01.910 --> 18:06.730
The principle is born again and again.

18:06.730 --> 18:13.150
In India we can say the Adi Nath, we had one
Adi Nath, the Guru long time back.

18:13.150 --> 18:25.180
Then we had Dattatreya, we had Janaka, Nanaka,
Sai Nath.

18:25.180 --> 18:39.140
We had in the Middle East Mohammed Sahib,
Lao Tse in China, Confucius – all these

18:39.140 --> 18:53.160
great Principles of Gurus who were born, they
had one job to do is to establish your dharma.

18:53.160 --> 18:58.530
Their job was not to give you Realization,
you must understand, everyone has one’s

18:58.530 --> 18:59.530
own job.

18:59.530 --> 19:04.050
See Mine is a horrible job [She laughs] because
I have to do everybody’s jobs.

19:04.050 --> 19:06.920
But Their job was just to establish your dharma.

19:06.920 --> 19:13.530
They came at that time, in those places where
it was needed the most.

19:13.530 --> 19:17.170
So these ten principles as I told you, They
established.

19:17.170 --> 19:23.690
They are created in the Void, as you see here
the Void part, this part is made out of the

19:23.690 --> 19:25.530
water element.

19:25.530 --> 19:34.890
So whatever miracles They did, had something
to do with water, like They could create water

19:34.890 --> 19:36.530
anywhere they wanted to.

19:36.530 --> 19:40.730
They would not cure people.

19:40.730 --> 19:51.870
All of Them have created water in the desert
or in the places where …like in … Nanaka

19:51.870 --> 19:59.040
has created a Panja Sahab they call it, everywhere
They have been able to create water.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.190
Whatever They touched, They could create water
out of it.

20:02.190 --> 20:14.070
Water is the life, life force which sustains
us; without water we cannot live, that is

20:14.070 --> 20:15.450
the sustenance.

20:15.450 --> 20:27.040
But, They actually are symbolized in an ocean,
in the ocean, because They give us the salt,

20:27.040 --> 20:29.950
the salt of life, which gives us the sustenance.

20:29.950 --> 20:34.860
If you see the salt, if we do not have salt
in our body, we’ll have no sustenance.

20:34.860 --> 20:41.880
Christ has said, “You are the salt."

20:41.880 --> 20:43.202
Who are these “you”?

20:43.202 --> 20:47.790
Are the people whom I was facing yesterday
and today.

20:47.790 --> 20:52.750
You are the gurus of today.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.990
But see with how many powers you have come.

20:55.990 --> 20:56.990
Just think of it.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.380
These Gurus did not have to give Realization.

20:59.380 --> 21:03.780
You can raise the Kundalini, you can give
Realization, you can cure people.

21:03.780 --> 21:08.570
Today Djamel asked Me that: “Mother did
They have the powers to cure?”

21:08.570 --> 21:12.350
I said, “Powers They might have, but They’d
never use that power because They were not

21:12.350 --> 21:18.220
supposed to do; They were just to sustain
and imbibe these great principles."

21:18.220 --> 21:27.920
They did cures, specially the last Guru was
Sai Nath, He did cure people.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.810
But Djamel himself has cured a lady who was
dying, absolutely.

21:31.810 --> 21:34.460
Doctors had given up hopes and he cured her.

21:34.460 --> 21:40.790
Now she is out and she’s gone to India.

21:40.790 --> 21:51.050
Just think of it, that you have all the powers
of these gurus, though – though in dharma

21:51.050 --> 21:59.520
you are still failing.

21:59.520 --> 22:00.520
You are not absolute.

22:00.520 --> 22:05.240
You have to get it corrected, your dharmas
are to be corrected.

22:05.240 --> 22:10.590
Now what is dharma within us, is our attention.

22:10.590 --> 22:20.860
As our attention is, you can make out the
dharma of a person.

22:20.860 --> 22:22.360
Religion doesn’t convey that word.

22:22.360 --> 22:27.450
Dharma means the one which sustains you, “Dharayeti
sa dharma”, the one which sustains you.

22:27.450 --> 22:33.420
Your dharma is the way your attention is.

22:33.420 --> 22:40.590
To have a complete balanced attention is just
like the aeroplane, completely balanced and

22:40.590 --> 22:41.590
fully developed.

22:41.590 --> 22:51.330
If you have an imbalance in your dharma, the
first and foremost thing is fanaticism.

22:51.330 --> 22:57.210
If you are a fanatic, then you are the greatest
adharmi ever born.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.900
Dharma is balancing.

23:00.900 --> 23:11.840
First and foremost is to know that all the
dharmas belong to one lotus: Nabhi.

23:11.840 --> 23:18.110
Nabhi has got ten petals and these ten petals
are the ten sustenance within us.

23:18.110 --> 23:25.170
If you see that the Nabhi has got ten petals
– Nabhi center, the solar plexus, which

23:25.170 --> 23:27.910
manifests all of solar plexus.

23:27.910 --> 23:34.780
And if your, these ten sustenance are correct,
your attention will be so balanced.

23:34.780 --> 23:41.670
Unless and until a flower is balanced it is
not going to blossom out into a fruit.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.830
First is the balance.

23:42.830 --> 23:49.570
All fanaticism of any kind, of condemning
any religion or any incarnation is against

23:49.570 --> 23:50.570
dharma.

23:50.570 --> 23:53.630
That gives you an imbalance.

23:53.630 --> 24:00.690
That means you have not understood the essence
of dharma because you are blind.

24:00.690 --> 24:09.380
To say that there’s something wrong with
what Christ has preached is as wrong as saying

24:09.380 --> 24:18.440
that there’s something wrong what Moses
has preached, or Dattatreya has preached,

24:18.440 --> 24:22.440
or Nanaka has preached.

24:22.440 --> 24:27.809
Actually, Mohammed Sahib thought that He has
said whatever was necessary, so that there

24:27.809 --> 24:29.560
is no need for Him to come back.

24:29.560 --> 24:35.960
But when He saw these horrible fanatics, even
today they are, He thought, “Baba, better

24:35.960 --> 24:38.170
let Me take again the birth, what to do now
with these madcaps?

24:38.170 --> 24:47.640
The thing that I preached, they are just going
against it.

24:47.640 --> 24:51.320
Because I said I will not come, so they are
becoming such fanatics."

24:51.320 --> 24:55.350
He had to take His birth because, you see,
human beings are such foolish things that

24:55.350 --> 24:57.980
these incarnations don’t know what to do.

24:57.980 --> 25:02.530
You don’t know how they will behave!

25:02.530 --> 25:11.670
So He took His birth again as Nanaka on this
Earth, and His own daughter, Adi Shakti, was

25:11.670 --> 25:13.500
born as His sister.

25:13.500 --> 25:20.750
What Nanaka was preaching throughout and throughout
was this: that Hindu and Muslims are the same

25:20.750 --> 25:26.730
in the eyes of God, and that you all combine
together and become one.

25:26.730 --> 25:32.760
If there is anything that He has taught or
Kabira has taught is this and this and this.

25:32.760 --> 25:36.820
But look at the Sikhs, the way they fight
the Muslims; and look at the way the Muslims

25:36.820 --> 25:38.140
fight the Sikhs in India.

25:38.140 --> 25:42.290
We have created two nations out of it.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.190
Imagine!

25:44.190 --> 25:48.700
What He preached is just the opposite people
are doing about it.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.602
How do you explain I don’t understand.

25:51.602 --> 25:55.650
I mean when somebody has said, “This is
light,” how do you make it darkness I can’t

25:55.650 --> 25:56.650
understand.

25:56.650 --> 26:02.570
This is the speciality of human beings, is
to create darkness out of light.

26:02.570 --> 26:13.380
Now this dharma that They preached, is preached
by all of Them, and They have been particularly

26:13.380 --> 26:19.370
against all that goes against awareness, because
if your attention is not all right your awareness

26:19.370 --> 26:21.970
will not be all right.

26:21.970 --> 26:28.610
And so They were very anxious – all throughout,
all of Them – that They preached that don’t

26:28.610 --> 26:30.960
take anything that will reduce your awareness.

26:30.960 --> 26:40.059
That’s why They were against alcoholism,
They were against drugs and things like that.

26:40.059 --> 26:45.840
There were no cigarettes at the times perhaps,
when Mohammed Sahib came in, so He didn’t

26:45.840 --> 26:50.250
say, “Don’t take any cigarettes,” because
cigarettes came later on.

26:50.250 --> 26:53.340
But Nanaka said, “No cigarettes at all."

26:53.340 --> 26:56.010
Now you are finding out that cigarette causes
cancer.

26:56.010 --> 27:00.980
“It only causes cancer, it’s all right,
doesn’t matter, because cancer – at the

27:00.980 --> 27:03.120
most the body will die again you’ll be born
again.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.120
Doesn’t matter."

27:04.120 --> 27:08.059
It’s not that.

27:08.059 --> 27:13.761
That creates a problem in the Vishuddhi, so
bad that you cannot get your Realization so

27:13.761 --> 27:21.380
many of you, takes time, and your poor Mother
has to work for your cigarette enjoyment for

27:21.380 --> 27:22.710
days together.

27:22.710 --> 27:28.740
I’ve worked very hard, you know that.

27:28.740 --> 27:29.740
Then the drug people.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.610
They have enjoyed their drugs very nicely.

27:31.610 --> 27:39.740
They have been taking drugs, you see, enjoying
themselves, going high, or whatever they call

27:39.740 --> 27:40.740
it.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.000
Ask Me.

27:42.000 --> 27:49.000
How much I had to work, with tears in My eyes
because I know you are saints, you are meant

27:49.000 --> 27:54.050
to be higher people, and how much I had to
struggle to get you out.

27:54.050 --> 28:02.330
Can you imagine, for four years I was struggling
with six hippies in London [laughter].

28:02.330 --> 28:05.620
Six only.

28:05.620 --> 28:10.420
And first lot came to Me who were really pleased,
they had done a good job out of themselves.

28:10.420 --> 28:17.820
The only advantage was they had taken LSD
and all that so they were on supraconscious

28:17.820 --> 28:22.050
level, and they could see only light coming
out of Me, they saw all supraconscious things,

28:22.050 --> 28:25.350
lights and things and all that, so they stuck
on to Me.

28:25.350 --> 28:30.850
Or I stuck on to them, all right, but they
also stuck on to Me.

28:30.850 --> 28:33.880
Today they are one of the best Sahaja Yogis
we have here.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.620
They are the topmost Sahaja Yogis.

28:37.620 --> 28:45.480
They are the most beautiful Sahaja Yogis we
can say, because they were saints I could

28:45.480 --> 28:46.850
see their Spirit shining.

28:46.850 --> 28:58.940
I could not lose that sight, worked very hard
for them.

28:58.940 --> 28:59.940
They are saints.

28:59.940 --> 29:01.800
They got lost into drugs because they thought
they are seeking.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.500
They did not do it out of fashion.

29:03.500 --> 29:08.730
In India you see, when the Indian young people
see you taking drugs, they think, “Oh must

29:08.730 --> 29:09.730
be something great."

29:09.730 --> 29:13.210
You see, it’s very fashionable nowadays
in India for young people to take drugs and

29:13.210 --> 29:14.210
wear jeans.

29:14.210 --> 29:19.070
They think by that they are getting sophisticated
[laughter].

29:19.070 --> 29:21.550
But they don’t know why you did it, they
really do not know.

29:21.550 --> 29:24.410
They don’t know that you did it in seeking.

29:24.410 --> 29:29.740
They are such foolish Indians, you see, that
they are doing it because they think that

29:29.740 --> 29:31.620
it’s very fashionable, you know.

29:31.620 --> 29:35.210
Everybody will call them “up-to-date”
[laughter].

29:35.210 --> 29:41.679
They don’t know why you left your homes,
why you became like this.

29:41.679 --> 29:45.780
They don’t know the deeper side of your
life, they just see superficially.

29:45.780 --> 29:53.640
And it’s very common now in the universities
and things, this has started in a big way.

29:53.640 --> 29:59.309
But they are no good for Sahaja Yoga, useless
people trying to copy.

29:59.309 --> 30:04.080
How can they copy your seeking, that depth?

30:04.080 --> 30:17.820
That’s why these people were very much against
all those things that dulls your awareness.

30:17.820 --> 30:21.350
Even now I have seen people who have been
taking drugs and all that, in Sahaja Yoga.

30:21.350 --> 30:26.020
As soon as they see Me they start, “haah,”
sleeping.

30:26.020 --> 30:29.690
They go into sleep.

30:29.690 --> 30:36.780
Because immediately, as soon as you start
taking these drugs or all these alcohols,

30:36.780 --> 30:40.720
you move towards your left side, or to your
right side.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.350
Mostly to your left side.

30:43.350 --> 30:45.710
Alcohol specially, left side.

30:45.710 --> 30:50.090
By moving your left side, you see, you go
into your collective subconscious, you cross

30:50.090 --> 30:59.910
over to your Ida Nadi and goes beyond your
subconscious into collective subconscious.

30:59.910 --> 31:00.910
You become very non-aggressive, no doubt.

31:00.910 --> 31:07.890
It is also because of too much of consciousness
that you are egoistical, you have started

31:07.890 --> 31:09.720
doing this.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.740
You thought that “Oh, our ego is too much."

31:11.740 --> 31:12.850
You can’t see your ego, so you said, “No,
let’s have some drinks."

31:12.850 --> 31:15.120
By that you go on the other side.

31:15.120 --> 31:24.490
When you start moving too much towards the
left you know what happens: you get possessed,

31:24.490 --> 31:30.850
because there are satanic forces let loose,
you get caught up.

31:30.850 --> 31:37.040
Now when you come to Sahaja Yoga after that,
you are always dragged, you always feel the

31:37.040 --> 31:40.460
heaviness at the back, all of you.

31:40.460 --> 31:46.640
Left Agnya, not the right – superego.

31:46.640 --> 31:58.190
You feel very sleepy; you feel like crying,
weeping all the time; you feel very much frightened;

31:58.190 --> 32:04.400
you cannot take any decision; any question
comes in, any problem comes in you shudder.

32:04.400 --> 32:11.790
It’s an escape, escape from reality.

32:11.790 --> 32:20.290
Say the reality is in this room, if you run
away from this room, this way or that way,

32:20.290 --> 32:28.390
you are running away from reality.

32:28.390 --> 32:38.470
I would say, after war, so many people died,
perhaps, perhaps, who were dissatisfied souls

32:38.470 --> 32:41.210
and in a very bad condition.

32:41.210 --> 32:51.990
Hitler was a satan, real satan, and all these
forces were let loose later on by these gurus

32:51.990 --> 32:59.340
or whatever it is, and they captured you,
perhaps, that you took to these things.

32:59.340 --> 33:02.780
These are extremely injurious to our being.

33:02.780 --> 33:07.830
I went once to Trichu.

33:07.830 --> 33:14.390
They had invited Me and all these people came
in big cars to receive Me, I was quite surprised

33:14.390 --> 33:18.400
that seldom – Sahaja Yogis are never very
well-off people I mean, to that extent that

33:18.400 --> 33:19.670
you’ll have cars after cars.

33:19.670 --> 33:22.990
I said, “What business do you do all of
you?”

33:22.990 --> 33:26.760
They said, “You see, actually we are all
people growing tobacco."

33:26.760 --> 33:29.110
And I said, “Very nice."

33:29.110 --> 33:32.299
They are growing now, you see, not only eating
but growing also.

33:32.299 --> 33:34.820
And I said…

33:34.820 --> 33:40.570
In their houses you’ll be surprised, they
had tiles made in England, they had taps made

33:40.570 --> 33:41.570
in England.

33:41.570 --> 33:45.309
All these ancient things that you have had
which you treat as antiques today, they all

33:45.309 --> 33:47.190
had everything with them made in England [laughter].

33:47.190 --> 33:48.799
I said, “Made in England.

33:48.799 --> 33:49.799
How do you get all these things in here?”

33:49.799 --> 33:54.110
The things you do not have here they had it
there.

33:54.110 --> 33:56.280
I said, “How did you get it?”

33:56.280 --> 33:57.900
He said, “We are exporting tobacco to England."

33:57.900 --> 34:06.059
I said, “Very nice, what a nice work you
are doing, exporting tobacco to England."

34:06.059 --> 34:07.570
I said, “Don’t you think it is sinful
to do like this?

34:07.570 --> 34:10.139
Don’t you know as Indians that tobacco is
against religion?”

34:10.139 --> 34:12.710
He says, “We know but we don’t take.

34:12.710 --> 34:16.389
And if you give it to others [laughter], then
it’s nothing wrong."

34:16.389 --> 34:19.940
It’s like a person who owns all the race
course says, “I never see.

34:19.940 --> 34:21.550
I never put my money on a horse.

34:21.550 --> 34:23.010
I just collect.

34:23.010 --> 34:26.020
I’ve never seen a race course."

34:26.020 --> 34:28.840
That sort of a person, that sort of a, attitude
they had.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.450
So I said, “Very nice.

34:31.450 --> 34:35.470
You are exporting all your tobacco to England."

34:35.470 --> 34:38.400
I told them, “Don’t do it.

34:38.400 --> 34:43.879
You are very near the sea, and sea is the
guru, he will teach you a lesson of the worst

34:43.879 --> 34:44.879
type.

34:44.879 --> 34:49.090
I’m telling you today, now it is in the
attention of the sea.

34:49.090 --> 34:50.119
Believe Me.

34:50.119 --> 34:51.159
Remove this.

34:51.159 --> 34:52.830
Do not send any tobacco.

34:52.830 --> 34:53.970
Do not grow, you can …”

34:53.970 --> 34:55.710
They said, “What should we grow?”

34:55.710 --> 34:58.040
I said, “You can grow very good cotton”.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.370
There were three-four people who took Me seriously.

35:00.370 --> 35:02.990
They said, “All right, Mother, we will grow
cotton."

35:02.990 --> 35:07.609
And they really started making a big money
because they produced very long threads, just

35:07.609 --> 35:10.380
like Egyptian cotton they started doing.

35:10.380 --> 35:13.110
The rest of them didn’t like Me.

35:13.110 --> 35:17.330
They didn’t thank Me, they didn’t come
to see Me off at the station – all their

35:17.330 --> 35:19.130
cars were just fizzled out.

35:19.130 --> 35:25.090
I thought I had to take a taxi to go the station
now [laughter, She laughs].

35:25.090 --> 35:29.190
But can you imagine, within one year’s time,
there was a typhoon.

35:29.190 --> 35:32.680
And there was another thing going on.

35:32.680 --> 35:39.750
These people were exporting this to England,
and selling tobacco, the… you see the cheap

35:39.750 --> 35:43.940
type tobacco, you see whatever are the remains,
the molasses you can call it, they were selling

35:43.940 --> 35:51.010
it to the poor people; and poor people were
taking that very concentrated, eating that.

35:51.010 --> 35:56.240
So they took to black magic spiritualism.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.609
All of them were doing black magic.

35:57.609 --> 36:02.820
In their small little huts they were sitting
doing black magic – can you imagine?

36:02.820 --> 36:07.620
– in their villages doing black magic.

36:07.620 --> 36:11.750
And the sea got so angry with the typhoon.

36:11.750 --> 36:21.810
You might have heard about the big floods
in that area.

36:21.810 --> 36:25.810
I must warn Brighton people [laughter].

36:25.810 --> 36:34.850
The sea is taking a respite now, you just
see that, because you are insulting the sea,

36:34.850 --> 36:40.550
all the time you are insulting him.

36:40.550 --> 36:45.619
This holiday-making now – it’s a disease
with the western people.

36:45.619 --> 36:46.619
Holiday.

36:46.619 --> 36:52.420
There’s a girl in Sahaja Yoga, her sister
also comes sometime, she was to have a baby,

36:52.420 --> 36:57.650
she is a lady doctor, sister – she has gone
for a holiday, without any heart.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.650
She had a caesarean, can you imagine?

37:00.650 --> 37:05.620
All the Sahaja Yogis putting all their attention
to the birth of the child, and this lady has

37:05.620 --> 37:09.650
very nicely gone for a holiday because holiday
she must have.

37:09.650 --> 37:14.280
You see without holiday, she is nowhere.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.600
It’s all programmed; you must go for a holiday.

37:16.600 --> 37:21.570
What have you achieved by going to holidays
I would like to know, what wisdoms?

37:21.570 --> 37:27.150
Except for sitting in the sun, getting a skin
disease, and a skin cancer for Me to cure.

37:27.150 --> 37:31.940
What is the need to go in the sun such a lot
I don’t understand.

37:31.940 --> 37:33.040
What are you achieving?

37:33.040 --> 37:35.359
Your healths are going from bad to worse.

37:35.359 --> 37:38.360
Your forefathers had much better health than
you people have.

37:38.360 --> 37:42.000
Despite all these health things you are doing,
what is your health?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.790
Your livers are out.

37:43.790 --> 37:44.790
If you…

37:44.790 --> 37:48.940
That’s nice, I’m happy the sun is coming,
now you’ll give up your alcohol.

37:48.940 --> 37:53.100
Let the sun scorch you, then you’ll give
up your alcohol.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.100
Otherwise you will not.

37:54.100 --> 37:58.810
Here, you go in the sun, sit there, take all
the alcohols there, drink all wine – in

37:58.810 --> 38:03.950
the presence of the sea.

38:03.950 --> 38:11.680
No wonder all these oil tankers are breaking
there and spoiling your health resorts.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.680
That will happen.

38:12.680 --> 38:21.510
You have no consideration for the sea is there,
is your guru and you are drinking like mad.

38:21.510 --> 38:26.240
Nude women sitting down there tanning themselves.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.360
What’s this nonsense going on?

38:28.360 --> 38:32.790
I mean I don’t understand what is the need
to tan your body like this?

38:32.790 --> 38:36.360
Who has told you that you look beautiful?

38:36.360 --> 38:37.610
You look ghastly with that.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.180
I really tell you, you look ghastly.

38:39.180 --> 38:46.070
Here you are discriminating on racial points
[laughter], saying that people are dark, why

38:46.070 --> 38:50.359
are you darkening yourself I can’t understand,
what is the wisdom [laughter, She laughs]?

38:50.359 --> 38:51.800
You know going to the other extreme.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.730
All right, once in a while you sit in the
sun, do something, is all right.

38:55.730 --> 39:03.720
But what is the need for you to be so extremely
concerned about your holidaying, and in the

39:03.720 --> 39:08.580
holiday drink, fight with wife, come back
and have a divorce.

39:08.580 --> 39:15.450
Always after a holiday, the after-effects
of the alcohol you can see very clearly.

39:15.450 --> 39:21.410
In India, thank God we do not go out for holidays
at all, we don’t believe in holidaying,

39:21.410 --> 39:23.320
at all!

39:23.320 --> 39:29.100
At the most if you have to go somewhere, we
go to some festival or to somebody’s marriage

39:29.100 --> 39:35.010
or something; if there is an occasion only
then we move out of the houses, we are gruhasthas,

39:35.010 --> 39:39.900
we settle in the family, gruhasthas who stays
in the gruha, householders.

39:39.900 --> 39:43.520
We are not like vagabond gypsies all the time
moving about.

39:43.520 --> 39:48.050
It’s all right once in a while, just to
enjoy a picnic or something.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.410
I mean you are not scouts all your life.

39:50.410 --> 39:53.910
Yes, it’s so maddening, you don’t know.

39:53.910 --> 39:59.020
My husband’s office there are two great
executives, British, they cycle down to the

39:59.020 --> 40:00.020
office.

40:00.020 --> 40:03.250
It looks so odd, you know, with half-pants
[laughter].

40:03.250 --> 40:08.970
With such a big office, how will it look,
two half-pant people coming down, with a half-pant

40:08.970 --> 40:15.910
and perspiring and smelling and everything.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.920
It is absurd!

40:17.920 --> 40:19.740
[Laughter]

40:19.740 --> 40:25.310
But there is something behind this all-frantic
effort, is you are seeking something.

40:25.310 --> 40:32.100
Some people think that by going to holidays
you will achieve something.

40:32.100 --> 40:36.810
I mean music, what have you achieved in music
now, I don’t understand.

40:36.810 --> 40:41.100
By going to these holidays, if you have achieved
this kind of music which shatters every part

40:41.100 --> 40:50.750
of your skin, I mean when I hear it, you know,
the whole vibrations go on, jamming into it

40:50.750 --> 40:51.750
(?).

40:51.750 --> 40:55.780
And your bad livers, think of that at least,
bad livers, your skin diseases, your skin

40:55.780 --> 40:59.650
cancers.

40:59.650 --> 41:03.740
All this in the presence of the guru, the
sea.

41:03.740 --> 41:04.910
Can you imagine?

41:04.910 --> 41:10.810
There is no auspiciousness in this, you do
not understand.

41:10.810 --> 41:14.900
The sea is to be worshipped.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.650
It’s a temple.

41:17.650 --> 41:24.020
It teaches you, it has given you such a lot.

41:24.020 --> 41:29.510
Think of the sea, what it has given you.

41:29.510 --> 41:32.210
Without the sea, what would have been your
condition?

41:32.210 --> 41:33.349
In England specially.

41:33.349 --> 41:40.250
It taught you challenge, it gave you ideas
how to go abroad, it has given you such a

41:40.250 --> 41:41.250
lot.

41:41.250 --> 41:45.400
All your wealth comes from sea and what are
you doing about your Lakshmi?

41:45.400 --> 41:51.330
And do you know, the Lakshmi Tattwa which
resides in the centre, is born out of the

41:51.330 --> 41:52.330
sea.

41:52.330 --> 41:56.730
Actually he is your grandfather.

41:56.730 --> 42:02.930
Do you have any respect for him?

42:02.930 --> 42:08.590
So much to learn, from the sea, from the guru.

42:08.590 --> 42:11.710
It never leaves its boundaries.

42:11.710 --> 42:13.290
It keeps to that.

42:13.290 --> 42:20.230
If you try to press the sea from one side
it will show on the other side, somewhere.

42:20.230 --> 42:26.250
Such a huge thing, it gets all the water from
all over the world, but it keeps its boundaries.

42:26.250 --> 42:31.880
It never crosses it, unless and until you
press it.

42:31.880 --> 42:39.990
That’s the sign of a magnanimous great personality:
it keeps its boundaries – I mean, so far

42:39.990 --> 42:48.460
and not that – The dignity of it is – I
don’t know if there’s a word like maryada

42:48.460 --> 42:55.040
in English language – is the boundaries
of decency and decorum.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.790
Then it gives you the rain.

42:56.790 --> 43:07.570
It gives you the basis of your food.

43:07.570 --> 43:08.920
Sea is the father.

43:08.920 --> 43:22.110
And where do they meet, really in the most
beautiful way, the sea and the Mother Earth?

43:22.110 --> 43:32.410
They meet at the Sahasrara on the Himalayas
where all the clouds freeze and cover completely

43:32.410 --> 43:37.619
the Mother Earth, where there is snow all
over, on the Alps.

43:37.619 --> 43:40.619
It’s complete purity.

43:40.619 --> 43:55.609
These are too subtle things for people who
are not seeking, but I’m talking to seekers.

43:55.609 --> 44:07.240
You have to be subtler people to understand
the beauty of the sea, its poetry of a guru.

44:07.240 --> 44:14.550
When it roars, you see, the roaring of the
sea challenges you: “Come up my child, come

44:14.550 --> 44:19.500
up my disciple, come up, come along."

44:19.500 --> 44:26.800
To Me sea is like a father.

44:26.800 --> 44:31.010
I’ve traveled by sea so much, so much.

44:31.010 --> 44:36.780
And anytime I have traveled it has carried
Me like a very gentle mother.

44:36.780 --> 44:40.870
Never a bad weather, such a nice weather.

44:40.870 --> 44:41.870
Always.

44:41.870 --> 44:46.320
It’s so kind, it’s so kind to Me.

44:46.320 --> 44:52.190
Once I was coming from Japan and they said,
“There are typhoons coming."

44:52.190 --> 44:54.109
Five typhoons were coming.

44:54.109 --> 44:56.640
They never touched My ship.

44:56.640 --> 44:57.640
Nowhere.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.240
People were amazed.

44:59.240 --> 45:05.320
And we were coming to Bombay from Colombo,
when we turned round it was monsoon.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.490
They said, “Now."

45:06.490 --> 45:07.640
The captain was quite amazed, you see.

45:07.640 --> 45:09.960
He said, “But now, you cannot help it.

45:09.960 --> 45:15.800
The wind will go in the other direction and
we are going to have a bad time."

45:15.800 --> 45:20.030
But what a smooth lake, just like a mirror,
beautiful!

45:20.030 --> 45:24.010
Just like a gentle mother.

45:24.010 --> 45:28.160
It carried Me on its sari I felt.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.400
So beautiful.

45:33.400 --> 45:40.320
And such a sea you insult, because you are
ignorant, because you are blind.

45:40.320 --> 45:45.300
I wish the sea forgives you, but gurus do
not forgive easily.

45:45.300 --> 45:46.480
Mother is different.

45:46.480 --> 45:52.310
Gurus are hard taskmasters, you see.

45:52.310 --> 46:00.000
They normally do not forgive you.

46:00.000 --> 46:09.180
Now you have heard about Ravi Shankar who
is a great musician who plays sitar.

46:09.180 --> 46:17.390
I know when he was studying in – he was
in the beginning a student of Allauddin Khasa.

46:17.390 --> 46:23.980
Allauddin Khasa was a Realized soul, a great
man, a genius, a genius he was.

46:23.980 --> 46:27.980
Absolutely a real guru, you should say.

46:27.980 --> 46:29.810
He never drank.

46:29.810 --> 46:39.000
And he was a Muslim but a worshipper of Kali,
you see, and all that.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.570
And he used to call Me “Ma."

46:42.570 --> 46:43.570
Mother.

46:43.570 --> 46:50.550
I was with My father who was the political
adviser to that State, Maihar [Madhya Pradesh].

46:50.550 --> 46:56.490
I mean you could see he was really so subtle
in everything!

46:56.490 --> 47:06.920
And he used to play that big drum which he
said the best is produced in Maihar, that’s

47:06.920 --> 47:13.201
why he settled down there, what we call is
the “pakhawaj” is the very big drum, you

47:13.201 --> 47:14.201
see.

47:14.201 --> 47:15.201
He used to play tremendously.

47:15.201 --> 47:18.539
He used to just go on into such echoes and
beautiful rendering.

47:18.539 --> 47:22.170
And he was a master of so many things like
sarod – his son himself is Ali Akbar Khan

47:22.170 --> 47:23.170
Sahib.

47:23.170 --> 47:24.830
His daughter Annapurna is a great singer and
all that.

47:24.830 --> 47:36.650
And I remember Allauddin, when we went there,
he used to respect My father very much and

47:36.650 --> 47:48.470
– also because My father was a great connoisseur
of music and a Realized soul himself, a great

47:48.470 --> 47:49.470
man.

47:49.470 --> 47:55.680
So, once he was going to play the pakhawaj
and Ravi Shankar was also sitting there you

47:55.680 --> 47:57.710
see, hiding his face on the sides.

47:57.710 --> 48:02.440
So when he had played his pakhawaj, My father
said: “Why don’t you also play some sitar

48:02.440 --> 48:08.290
to me, I would like to see how much you have
learned."

48:08.290 --> 48:09.560
He said: “No, no, sir, not today, not today."

48:09.560 --> 48:12.240
So then he went inside, for something – the
guru.

48:12.240 --> 48:15.060
He [Ravi] said: “See, are you going to see
here something?”

48:15.060 --> 48:16.630
He [father] said: “What?”

48:16.630 --> 48:24.530
“Big lump, you see, was here”, he said:
“He has broken my sitar on my head today

48:24.530 --> 48:30.810
because I played two notes wrongly.

48:30.810 --> 48:33.589
See sir."

48:33.589 --> 48:34.980
[Laughter]

48:34.980 --> 48:38.420
That was the thing.

48:38.420 --> 48:43.450
The gurus are very, very, strict people, they
have to be.

48:43.450 --> 48:48.510
And the way they used to treat the disciples.

48:48.510 --> 48:50.680
It’s not like this.

48:50.680 --> 49:05.290
The gurus you know are the gurus who are trying
to pamper your ego.

49:05.290 --> 49:06.290
Why?

49:06.290 --> 49:09.589
Because they want your purse.

49:09.589 --> 49:13.890
They don’t want to enlighten you.

49:13.890 --> 49:18.910
They say, “All right, what, you drink?

49:18.910 --> 49:19.910
All right, doesn’t matter.

49:19.910 --> 49:21.380
I can give you more.

49:21.380 --> 49:24.190
Whatever you want I’ll give you.

49:24.190 --> 49:27.630
Just pass the purse this side, that’s all.

49:27.630 --> 49:40.170
Why do you want to have these, metal, this…
some metal-like, metallic things like a, say

49:40.170 --> 49:42.310
a Rolls Royce?

49:42.310 --> 49:45.320
What’s the use, this metal thing?

49:45.320 --> 49:48.510
You pass it over to me.

49:48.510 --> 49:49.510
I’ll look after it.

49:49.510 --> 49:52.420
What is the need for you to have possessed
this grand palace?

49:52.420 --> 49:56.080
Pass it over to me.

49:56.080 --> 50:02.600
I’ll look after – you must give up everything
for me.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.300
I’ll enlighten you."

50:04.300 --> 50:09.160
Even if you may have palaces and anything,
the real guru will not look at your face.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.710
He never hankers after people, never.

50:10.710 --> 50:14.140
That’s the sign of a real guru: that he
doesn’t hanker after you: “Come along

50:14.140 --> 50:16.040
to me, come along to me.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.250
All right, how many people are coming?

50:18.250 --> 50:21.330
Now have an organization and run a big mission
about it."

50:21.330 --> 50:27.130
And then the people are coming and write your
names and you become the members of the society

50:27.130 --> 50:29.770
and all that.

50:29.770 --> 50:34.680
A real guru will sit in some odd place, where
you have to go seven miles up, walking, falling,

50:34.680 --> 50:36.530
somewhere hidden, and there you go and you
find he’s not there.

50:36.530 --> 50:37.530
[Laughter]You break your legs on the way.

50:37.530 --> 50:39.190
[Shri Mataji laughs, laughter]

50:39.190 --> 50:41.300
But they know so many things.

50:41.300 --> 50:45.950
According to them, you are not to be treated
that kindly.

50:45.950 --> 50:50.040
And they tell Me that “Mother, what is Your
whim?”.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.950
And “We can’t understand.

50:51.950 --> 50:56.339
For us, we had to work so hard to get these
vibrations."

50:56.339 --> 51:02.359
One gentleman has told that: “I was a frog.

51:02.359 --> 51:05.710
Since then I’ve been seeking.

51:05.710 --> 51:11.350
And I’ve spent how many years I don’t
know, so many thousand years to get vibrations,

51:11.350 --> 51:16.480
while Mother has just given you like this!

51:16.480 --> 51:18.890
What is your speciality?

51:18.890 --> 51:21.580
Are you going to give your life for Mother?”

51:21.580 --> 51:23.260
And all sort of questions.

51:23.260 --> 51:24.260
[She laughs]

51:24.260 --> 51:26.960
So I asked him: “Why did you tell them?

51:26.960 --> 51:28.640
I don’t want their life.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.660
What’s the use of their life?

51:30.660 --> 51:32.839
I want their Spirit."

51:32.839 --> 51:36.480
He said, “But why these?”

51:36.480 --> 51:40.119
I said, “Are you jealous?”

51:40.119 --> 51:41.119
[Laughter]

51:41.119 --> 51:45.410
They say that “Mother, You carry on with
them.

51:45.410 --> 51:48.110
We can’t face this, human beings are horrible."

51:48.110 --> 51:59.820
And I’ve told you that I asked one person
to go to America, he ran away, within two

51:59.820 --> 52:00.820
days.

52:00.820 --> 52:01.820
Within two days.

52:01.820 --> 52:05.720
He would not face Americans – the real ones.

52:05.720 --> 52:09.440
The unreal ones are very nice, you see.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.920
There’s mutual understanding going on.

52:11.920 --> 52:13.600
So these hard taskmasters are so beautiful.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.220
From outside they look so harsh.

52:15.220 --> 52:17.070
Inside, they are so beautiful.

52:17.070 --> 52:20.330
You must know how to please them.

52:20.330 --> 52:24.710
For example, I went to see one guru once and
all the boys were against it.

52:24.710 --> 52:30.560
He said, “Mother, we don’t believe in
any guru, why are you going to see?”

52:30.560 --> 52:35.400
I said, “I don’t believe in any guru,
who told you?

52:35.400 --> 52:36.630
I believe in all the gurus.

52:36.630 --> 52:38.470
I don’t believe in the agurus."

52:38.470 --> 52:41.800
I said, “You see the vibrations."

52:41.800 --> 52:45.950
We had to climb up and this and that, and
we went down there.

52:45.950 --> 52:49.030
And it was raining heavily, very heavily.

52:49.030 --> 52:53.660
And the guru was very angry he was sitting
there, because he could control water, I told

52:53.660 --> 52:54.660
you.

52:54.660 --> 52:56.690
He could control rain, you know.

52:56.690 --> 53:01.160
So when I went up he was doing like this,
very angry.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.390
He wouldn’t even look at Me.

53:03.390 --> 53:08.290
I went and sat down, all drenched in water
with that rain.

53:08.290 --> 53:25.070
He said, “Why did You not allow me to stop
the rain, is it because of my ego that You

53:25.070 --> 53:27.180
wanted to punish me?

53:27.180 --> 53:33.600
I didn’t want You to get drenched when You
are coming to see me."

53:33.600 --> 53:34.690
What a great thing.

53:34.690 --> 53:39.550
I mean he talked to Me as if he knew Me, you
see, the way he talked.

53:39.550 --> 53:45.020
He said, “Not even my gurus and gurus never
had such an opportunity that You are coming

53:45.020 --> 53:52.020
to see me, and I was just prepared here, and
here You are coming all drenched.

53:52.020 --> 53:56.150
What a shame for me I could not control this
rain.

53:56.150 --> 53:59.349
It’s all Your doing Mother, why did You
do it?”

53:59.349 --> 54:03.920
I said, “Should I tell you why I did it?”

54:03.920 --> 54:05.290
He said, “Why?”

54:05.290 --> 54:12.650
I said, “You see, you have bought a sari
for Me, isn’t it?

54:12.650 --> 54:20.890
And I would not take a sari from a sanyasi;
but if I get drenched, then I’ll have to

54:20.890 --> 54:21.890
take."

54:21.890 --> 54:22.890
[Laughter]

54:22.890 --> 54:23.890
The whole thing melted away.

54:23.890 --> 54:26.530
The whole thing, the whole temper, everything
melted away.

54:26.530 --> 54:29.520
It was so sweet, you know, so sweet.

54:29.520 --> 54:35.410
There was an artist with Me, who has done
the painting.

54:35.410 --> 54:37.690
So beautiful, showing the love, you see.

54:37.690 --> 54:38.690
He just fell at My Feet.

54:38.690 --> 54:39.690
He said, “Mother, people have praised You.

54:39.690 --> 54:41.800
What words should I use to praise You?”

54:41.800 --> 54:43.020
I said, “Nothing.

54:43.020 --> 54:49.220
Your sari, you bring it for Me.

54:49.220 --> 54:52.350
First of all, I must wear your sari, I’m
all drenched."

54:52.350 --> 54:53.350
So happy.

54:53.350 --> 54:56.740
It’s so beautiful the whole thing.

54:56.740 --> 55:00.940
This is what it is.

55:00.940 --> 55:02.800
You all have to be the gurus.

55:02.800 --> 55:08.310
I know, first thing you learn is to be very,
great hard taskmasters, to begin with.

55:08.310 --> 55:10.900
That you should not do.

55:10.900 --> 55:15.490
You have to be hard taskmaster with yourself.

55:15.490 --> 55:18.750
And then, as your Mother, Who is your Guru,
is very sweet and tolerant, very kind, extremely

55:18.750 --> 55:19.750
patient.

55:19.750 --> 55:22.440
You have to deal with people like that.

55:22.440 --> 55:30.510
Because we are not dealing with people who
are seekers of that quality, who will do anything

55:30.510 --> 55:31.510
to get to God.

55:31.510 --> 55:32.849
We are dealing with people who are confused,
absolutely confused.

55:32.849 --> 55:34.230
They are saints, but they are confused.

55:34.230 --> 55:37.010
See, people come to our program, disappear.

55:37.010 --> 55:39.901
They’ll get their Realization and disappear.

55:39.901 --> 55:40.901
Then you have to give them bandhans, this
thing.

55:40.901 --> 55:41.901
You see, they are still confused.

55:41.901 --> 55:44.690
And there are so many gurus who are acting,
there are so many things that are happening,

55:44.690 --> 55:46.630
so we cannot be aggressive with them.

55:46.630 --> 55:53.460
We have to be very patient, and we have to
think about our past, how we came to Mother,

55:53.460 --> 55:57.860
how She had to convince us, how much we argued
with Her, what all we did.

55:57.860 --> 56:05.040
So these people are coming, let us try to
be kind to them and talk to them, and tell

56:05.040 --> 56:08.290
in a way which is congenial, which is beautiful.

56:08.290 --> 56:15.750
Not like those gurus because they had only
one guru, and one disciple, do you know that?

56:15.750 --> 56:20.720
The relationship was only one plus one.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.970
And that one also used to come down, many-a-times.

56:23.970 --> 56:29.109
Like one person I know, whom I met, he’s
told Me, “I have only one disciple and I’ve

56:29.109 --> 56:30.109
given him up.

56:30.109 --> 56:31.520
He’s thrown in the sea, he’s useless."

56:31.520 --> 56:32.520
I said, “What happened?”

56:32.520 --> 56:36.190
He said, “I trained him up for twenty-five
years and he’s a good-for-nothing fellow.

56:36.190 --> 56:39.110
Now he’s having a nice time, earning money.

56:39.110 --> 56:41.070
He’s a Realized soul, just imagine.

56:41.070 --> 56:45.030
And he’s having a nice time and he’s making
money out of it.

56:45.030 --> 56:49.450
This is the last story I’ll tell you."

56:49.450 --> 56:51.849
I said, “All right, where is he?”

56:51.849 --> 56:54.480
He told Me his name, this Maharaj.

56:54.480 --> 56:58.030
I said, “All right, I’ll see him, don’t
you worry."

56:58.030 --> 57:03.590
And when this fellow came in Bombay, one lady
telephoned to Me, “Mother, you wanted to

57:03.590 --> 57:06.940
meet this Maharaji, he’s coming to my house."

57:06.940 --> 57:09.910
I said, “All right, tell him I’m coming
to see him."

57:09.910 --> 57:15.420
I went down to see him, he was smoking cigarettes
like this, sitting like this.

57:15.420 --> 57:18.730
“Oh Mataji has come, very nice” and all
that.

57:18.730 --> 57:22.490
He, of course, I mean he touched My feet like
this, “All right, sit down."

57:22.490 --> 57:26.600
And there were ladies pressing his feet and
all that and he was talking to them very…

57:26.600 --> 57:31.420
trying to show lot of arrogance in My presence.

57:31.420 --> 57:34.640
I was just looking at him.

57:34.640 --> 57:36.780
Then he said, “Oh.

57:36.780 --> 57:40.970
So, my guru comes to see You in Bombay.

57:40.970 --> 57:43.630
Why is he leaving his place?

57:43.630 --> 57:45.849
Why should he do this?”.

57:45.849 --> 57:50.730
And all sorts of thing he was talking, against
his guru.

57:50.730 --> 57:57.200
I said, “All right, now I’m going, but
I will put some sindoor on your head, just

57:57.200 --> 58:02.330
to put a tilak on your head,” I said.

58:02.330 --> 58:09.260
So I took some sindoor, put it on his head;
Agnya Chakra I moved it.

58:09.260 --> 58:10.920
Then I said, “Now you put."

58:10.920 --> 58:11.920
When he start put…

58:11.920 --> 58:14.730
I sucked his hand, you see completely, and
he started, “Ahee-hee-hee-hee-hee he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he."

58:14.730 --> 58:17.020
He said, “Mother, Mother what are You doing,
what are You doing?”

58:17.020 --> 58:18.760
I said, “What am I doing?

58:18.760 --> 58:24.760
Will you please take back all the words you
have said about your guru?

58:24.760 --> 58:26.119
You have no shame.

58:26.119 --> 58:31.740
Twenty-five years that man worked on you and
you’re bringing all the shame here.

58:31.740 --> 58:33.670
Will you remove your hand?”

58:33.670 --> 58:36.740
He said, “I can’t, I can’t, I can’t!

58:36.740 --> 58:37.740
What are You doing to me?”

58:37.740 --> 58:43.260
I said, “Unless and until you promise that
you will not say a word against your guru

58:43.260 --> 58:49.000
and hold your ears, with the another hand,
or with your legs [She laughs], then only

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
I’ll leave you."

58:50.000 --> 58:52.890
(Laughter) He said, “I’m sorry, I’m
sorry, You will drop…?”

58:52.890 --> 58:58.920
Now the others didn’t see all this conversation,
you see, they just saw his shaking, you see.

58:58.920 --> 59:02.180
When I went away he said, “See, how powerful
I am?

59:02.180 --> 59:03.180
See."

59:03.180 --> 59:06.780
[Laughter] Fools as they were, they never
realized that he was shaking, and what shaking

59:06.780 --> 59:07.780
means, you see?

59:07.780 --> 59:11.910
And he made such a fool out of them.

59:11.910 --> 59:21.650
He took from everyone, one and a quarter tola
[ed: tola is an old Indian weight equal to

59:21.650 --> 59:24.570
180 grains, 0.375 troy ounces.]

59:24.570 --> 59:32.940
gold, you see, as a dakshina, guru dakshina,
and said that “See, even Mataji – I was

59:32.940 --> 59:38.630
getting all Her powers into me, sucking all
Her Powers into me."

59:38.630 --> 59:44.910
[Laughter] And these fools believed him, you
see.

59:44.910 --> 59:54.070
And then one of them met Me at the airport
and she told Me that “He’s taken away

59:54.070 --> 59:55.320
so much money from us.

59:55.320 --> 01:00:02.380
That day only he made us pay for one and a
quarter tola gold for the guru dakshina."

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.630
I said, “All right, I’ll see him one day,
again."

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.270
But all of them were doomed like that.

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:11.230
So, this is what it is.

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:13.760
And he’s so attractive to people, you know.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:21.590
And then he was sitting on a very big thing
and the thousands are approaching him, there.

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:25.140
But then I did some arrangements.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:32.380
Now he’s all right, in the jail, direct
[laughter].

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.870
In the jail, direct.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:36.290
That’s what it is.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:38.640
But we had one Sahaj Yogini like this.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:50.670
She got her Realization and I told her, “Your
guru was no good and you don’t take anything

01:00:50.670 --> 01:01:11.020
from him, because he’ll try to give you
some siddhis and you will try to impress people."

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:27.030
She said, “No, no Mother, I want the parama,
I want the last, the absolute, I don’t want

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:28.210
all that."

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:38.280
Because her guru used to carry some snakes
around and do all kinds of tricks you see,

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.060
go into tantrums.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:47.200
When I went to America, I heard about her,
that she’s having three thousand disciples;

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.940
I never had them in Bombay that time.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:57.099
I used to hardly get about two hundred people
somehow or other sticking on to this… thing.

01:01:57.099 --> 01:01:59.950
I said, “Three thousand.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:02.800
What is she doing?”

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:19.630
I got really worried you know; I put her into
bandhan and everything.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:33.980
But when I came back, you won’t believe,
she had silver water carriers you see, these

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:40.400
pitchers, she brought to wash My Feet and
this.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:44.690
I was so embarrassed, so embarrassed.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:51.819
And she showed Me, “See Mother, what work
I’m doing."

01:02:51.819 --> 01:03:00.020
Such a big photograph of Mine there, put,
and all the bhoots around.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.200
I could see all them hovering, you see, all
of them.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200
[Laughter]

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200
I said, “What is she doing?

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.060
What work has she been doing and what is she
up to?

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:19.329
Because she’s completely gone darkened and
haunted."

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:24.320
I asked her, “What are you doing with these
people?”

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.060
“Oh Mother, you don’t know.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:28.030
I’ve spread Your name there.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:35.810
I can even tell people if they have lost their
property somewhere, wherever is the hidden

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:38.550
money, or I tell so many things….

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:43.810
I can even tell the name of the horse which
is going to come first."

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:45.430
[Laughter] I said, “Very nice.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:49.650
What a nice Sahaj Yoga is going on here,”
you see?

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:54.920
So I told her, “All right, you come and
see Me tomorrow at home."

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.010
She came down.

01:03:56.010 --> 01:04:00.360
I had two-three people sitting, I said, “All
right, tell about them."

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.900
She said, “You live near a bridge."

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.870
He said, “No, never, I live near a sea.

01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:08.100
How can you bridge a sea?”

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.960
Then she said this, that.

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.440
He said, “No, nothing."

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.300
Then she told another lady.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.410
She said, “Nothing."

01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:17.390
Third person said, “Nothing, this is not
true.

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:21.710
You are just telling something that is not
true."

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:26.050
So she rushed to Me, “Mother, have You taken
away all my powers?”

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:27.050
[Laughter]

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:30.960
I said, “If they were your powers I would
have made you sit here.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.500
These are the powers of the devil.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:37.620
What interest God has got to tell that ‘What
is the horse coming,’ and all that?

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.180
[Laughter] Why should you tell all these things?

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:44.460
These are not your powers, these are the powers
of the spirits which are haunting you, and

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:48.290
which you have captured, and your guru is
doing all this job."

01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:50.050
“Oh God, I never knew."

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:51.800
I said, “It is that.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.260
All right, say that ‘I give up.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.310
I give up.’

01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.360
Say it thrice."

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.820
She said, “All right, I’ll say, Mother.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.620
I want the parama, I want the absolute”.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:07.750
She went home, but you know this popularity,
this cheap popularity, is a very enticing

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:08.750
thing.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:12.870
She again carried on, and now she is in the
lunatic asylum.

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.520
This is what it is.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.580
Because these spirits which help you, come
back on you and torture you.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:22.390
So all those people who try to deviate, even
after Realization, are corrected by the principle

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:23.910
of guru only.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:27.430
With the principle of Agnya, you give Realization,
enlightenment.

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:32.090
With the principle of Sahasrara you give integration,
but with the principle of guru you give them

01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:33.090
dharma.

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:42.329
That’s why so many people, all of you who
came to Me, have very easily given up all

01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:46.940
these habits, because you have found the Spirit,
the joy.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.340
And then you don’t want all that.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:06:00.750
I don’t have to tell you that you have to
give up, you just give up, you just forget

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:05.220
it, because your attention is now attached
to your Spirit.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:15.640
That is the job of a guru.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:22.200
It is said that: “Guru is that which makes
you meet the Sahib."

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.630
Means: “makes you meet the Lord."

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:27.819
He’s the guru.

01:06:27.819 --> 01:06:29.260
Otherwise all these are not gurus.

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.830
But the one who has not even settled your
dharmas, who does not have his own dharmas,

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:36.650
how can you accept them as gurus?

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:38.520
May God bless you all.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.069
[Start of 3: informal talk to seekers]

01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:43.220
Shri Mataji [about a young child]: This is
a born Realized child.

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:44.920
[Shri Mataji laughs]

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.180
Hello, how are you?

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.010
Hum, what are they catching?

01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:51.590
He is showing from his feet.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:53.100
All over right side Sahasrara.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.600
Right side Sahasrara means what?

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.600
Superego.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.480
It comes to the right [of the brain].

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:02.640
All feeling the heaviness on the right side,
the little child is showing.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.640
They are working, they are busy all the time.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.819
All the time they are busy.

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:16.260
Gavin’s child’s such a little thing…
all the time.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:23.800
[Laughter, She laughs] Trying to clear you
out – great people they are.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:29.940
All the time they are working.

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:37.800
That’s why I want you all to get married
soon, with so many great children are to be

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800
born to you.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.300
All right, I can make it cool for you, it’s
all right, don’t you worry.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.300
[Laughter]

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.190
You have to think of the Moon who is your
maternal uncle.

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:47.190
He was born with Lakshmi.

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:49.190
There are fourteen things that were born from
the sea.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.589
One of them is also a hunter.

01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:57.140
The stick Gregoire gave Me yesterday was also,
came out of the sea.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.140
That was the fourteenth thing.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.140
Better now?

01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:00.774
Now, those who have come for the first time
should come forward, you see, it’s better

01:08:00.774 --> 01:08:01.774
in the forward line somewhere, would be better
and the second line could be – it’s all

01:08:01.774 --> 01:08:02.774
right.

01:08:02.774 --> 01:08:03.774
These people have come for the first time,
all of you?

01:08:03.774 --> 01:08:04.774
All right, can you come on these first three
lines, all right.

01:08:04.774 --> 01:08:05.774
Now who else is there?

01:08:05.774 --> 01:08:06.774
Please, come forward.

01:08:06.774 --> 01:08:11.440
As you know, Sahaja Yoga is a very subtle
thing and the main thing is it must work,

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:20.009
it must actualize, the Kundalini must rise.

01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:31.179
You must get your Realization, that’s the
main concern is.

01:08:31.179 --> 01:08:38.150
Whatever you may say, whatever your arguments
may be or any problems may be, we are not

01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:39.150
bothered about that.

01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:43.080
What we are bothered about: that you should
meet yourself.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.900
That’s the main point we are at, and that’s
what we have to achieve.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:52.859
Now the problems arise out of our imbalances
in life and so many things.

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:55.349
Whatever it is, still, the force is so great,
that you will get your Realization.

01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:56.349
Why I’m telling you?

01:08:56.349 --> 01:09:03.569
That I find people, once they get their Realization,
they think it’s done now, we are happy,

01:09:03.569 --> 01:09:05.079
then they don’t come.

01:09:05.079 --> 01:09:06.319
It’s just the germination has taken place,
the Kundalini has shot off, because She’s

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.409
been waiting all these days, you see, so the
whole thing comes up as a big experience.

01:09:07.409 --> 01:09:08.409
But that doesn’t mean that you have established
it.

01:09:08.409 --> 01:09:10.869
So the second thing you have to do is to establish,
that’s very important.

01:09:10.869 --> 01:09:15.099
Much more important than getting Realization
I feel, because the Realization, if it takes

01:09:15.099 --> 01:09:18.979
place and it falls down, then what’s the
use?

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:25.429
So you take your Realization, which you’ll
get, no doubt about it, because you all look

01:09:25.429 --> 01:09:26.429
that way.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:30.339
But, then you must have self-esteem and understand
that you have got it because you deserved

01:09:30.339 --> 01:09:31.339
it.

01:09:31.339 --> 01:09:34.799
Some people haven’t got it in India who
have been with Me for seven years, but you’ll

01:09:34.799 --> 01:09:35.799
get it I’m sure.

01:09:35.799 --> 01:09:36.819
That I can see clearly, you are all going
to get it.

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:40.369
But that doesn’t mean if you get it, that
you again waste it, because this is what you

01:09:40.369 --> 01:09:41.369
have been seeking all your lives.

01:09:41.369 --> 01:09:47.139
Because in the West the problem is: though
such saints are born, they have this rambling

01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:48.259
of the brain and they start thinking.

01:09:48.259 --> 01:09:49.259
You do not get it through your rationality.

01:09:49.259 --> 01:09:50.259
You get it through your Kundalini, which you
cannot think about.

01:09:50.259 --> 01:09:52.259
So you allow it to grow, manifest itself,
and you become as good as others are.

01:09:52.259 --> 01:09:55.177
Now they are all experts and gurus, you know,
they know such a lot about Kundalini.

01:09:55.177 --> 01:09:58.120
You’ll be amazed, they are all experts,
they look just like you!

01:09:58.120 --> 01:09:59.120
They are raising Kundalini, they are giving
Realization, they know everything about it.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.120
So in the same way, you have to be.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120
It’s a very simple thing which takes place
at any age, any time, any race, anything.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.120
The main thing is that you must have self-esteem,
you must know that you are saints.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120
You have been saints for years and you have
been ages like this.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120
You have been seeking and seeking and seeking.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120
Now when you have found it, you allow it to
grow, because it’s very important, and you

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120
must know your value.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120
That is important.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120
Because I value you, because I see something
much deeper that you can’t see.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120
But you don’t see that, gradually you’ll
start seeing, all right?

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120
On this promise, I’ll give you Realization.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.120
Put your hands like this.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.120
Put both the feet on the ground, straight.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120
Sometimes I find, you see I’ve worked very
hard on people and they get lost, I feel very

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.120
sorry for that.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120
Left Swadishthana, you see [She laughs] – give
him…

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120
Like a saint he’s sitting here, great guru.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120
[About a child]

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120
Now put your hands towards Me, like this,
and close your eyes.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.120
Please close your eyes.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.120
Now what happens is that first you become
thoughtlessly aware, nirvichar samadhi.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.120
Samadhi means enlightened awareness.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120
You get enlightened awareness which is thoughtless.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120
You become thoughtlessly aware.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.120
First.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120
And in the second happening, when it crosses
the Agnya it happens to you, and when it crosses,

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120
pierces through this point called as taloo,
the fontanel bone area, you start feeling

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120
the radiation of your Spirit in your hands,
like vibrations.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120
Are you feeling the cool breeze in your hands?

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120
Already you’ve got it!

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.120
You haven’t.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.120
There’s a little problem.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.120
All right, watch Me here, little bit.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.120
There?

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.120
Hm.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.120
Without thinking, just watch Me, it will work
out.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.120
Whatever I’ve said, you forget it.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.120
You see, if you have taken drugs doesn’t
matter, don’t worry.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.120
I can drink all that; just suck it out.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120
Don’t you worry about all these things,
forget, have no guilt of any kind, for heaven’s

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.120
sake.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.120
I’m talking of Ocean of Love which is ocean.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.120
What guilt can you have?

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.120
Just a speck.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:44.120
So please, do not have any guilt, on the contrary
say to Me that “Mother, we are not guilty

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.120
– I’m not guilty."

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.120
In your heart, just say that.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.120
That’s the only catching point in you.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.120
It’s a fashion also, these days, to feel
guilty about anything.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.120
Now close your eyes.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.120
Please close your eyes.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120
Know that you are not guilty at all, that
you are very beautiful.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120
Right to the left.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120
Move right to the – keep your eyes….

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.120
are you feeling?

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.120
It will work out.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.120
Just let it be, let it be, you see, let it
go, let it go.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120
Close your eyes.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120
You must get it.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120
Not to get upset with yourself.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120
Are you criticizing yourself?

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.120
Are you?

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.120
Seeker: Just frightened.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.120
Seeker: Just frightened.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120
Yogis: Frightened.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.120
Shri Mataji: Frightened, about what?

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.120
About the beauty that you have?

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120
Not to be frightened at all.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120
Nothing to be frightened.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120
Do I look frightful?

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.120
Seeker: Nothing.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.120
Shri Mataji: Ha?

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120
Seeker: Nothing.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120
Now close, close your eyes.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.120
No, there’s nothing to be frightened, it’s
the easiest thing that can happen, absolutely

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.120
it is there, it’s like the germination of
a seed.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120
Just close your eyes, nothing to be frightened.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120
Just let it go, let it go, that’s all.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.120
Is the simplest thing.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120
She’s got it.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120
Just like that.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.120
You have to be frightened of pubs and things
like that, you know.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.120
I’m really frightened of pubs.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120
Right to the left.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.120
Move (?) left to the right.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.120
Let’s feel his vibrations, come along.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.120
Some of you come along.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.120
No, at the back.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.120
Just sit down, sit down.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120
They’ll just work it out.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120
Close your eyes, close your eyes, they are
just helping you out, just close your eyes.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:33.120
Just – you see, it is like, they know the
swimming and they are just trying to help

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120
you.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.120
Once you are on the shore, they’ll also
teach you how to swim and then you are going

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.120
to save others.

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.120
Hm.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120
Work on him.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120
Close your eyes, don’t think about it.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.120
Just enjoy, this is the greatest thing you’ve
got it.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.120
Sahasrara, right.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
No, no, it’ll work out, don’t you worry,
we know your problem.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120
Just don’t – close your eyes.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.120
We know your problem.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.120
Right to the left.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120
We know your problem, we know everything where
that’s happening.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120
Just close your eyes.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120
There’s nothing to be frightened, I mean,
what’s going to happen?

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120
Somebody is frightening you inside.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.120
That’s what it is, I must say.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120
There’s nothing to be frightened.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120
Sakshat Moksha Dayini, Aham sakshat Moksha
Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.120
Sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.120

Moksha Dayini.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120
Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha
Dayini Aham sakshat Moksha Dayini Aham sakshat

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.120
Moksha Dayini.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120
With hand.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120
The…

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120
Marcus, just stand up and pull it out.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120
It’s working on him.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120
It’s all right, they are working it out.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.120
It’s started, now don’t…

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120
It’s started, already has started now.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.120
Close your eyes.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120
It’s working out.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120
Don’t you worry.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120
It’s working out.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:08.620
She’s got it very well.
