00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.761
This will be the fifth puja in Australia,

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:40.459
and I thought that this is the land of Ganesha,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.202
we should have the Ganesha Puja. Is very important
also, very helpful.

00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:48.249
We all should have Ganesha Puja,
it’s very important.

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:53.019
And so today
there will be Shri Ganesha Puja.

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:54.002
Have you

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.683
got the hundred and eight
names of Shri Ganesha?

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:43.187
So we have now requested John Fisher to be
your leader in Canberra. And he has agreed.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.494
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

00:03:51.494 --> 00:04:00.409
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra.

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:17.266
If you read the newspaper, just on the first
page you find people going amok as far as

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:22.594
their moral sense is concerned, absolutely
I mean, to us it is something so shocking,

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:31.896
and perhaps I think people are possessed on
their Mooladhara Chakra.

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:39.813
The way they behave one feels that there’s
something gone wrong with them completely

00:04:39.852 --> 00:04:48.337
and they have no control over themselves;
and just like mad people they are behaving.

00:04:48.377 --> 00:04:54.617
And all these problems that are coming, of
these perversions, are due to this kind of

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:58.807
a possession on the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:05.047
One has to be very, very careful and respectful
about it.

00:05:05.047 --> 00:05:10.637
I have already told so many things how to
keep it clean, how to respect it and how to

00:05:10.637 --> 00:05:16.047
behave yourself.

00:05:16.047 --> 00:05:28.047
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling

00:05:28.047 --> 00:05:30.427
into hell.

00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:42.157
But actually when we insult Him and we do
not care for Him, He just sleeps off.

00:05:42.157 --> 00:05:53.327
When that happens, any kind of a possession
can come and can really make people mad.

00:05:53.327 --> 00:06:02.667
When you come from India to these places you
are really surprised and shocked.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:08.667
What is wrong with these people, how can they
be behaving in this manner?

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:14.866
How can they go all out to ruin themselves
like this?

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:22.337
And how is it they do not understand the importance
of morality when they are following Christ?

00:06:22.337 --> 00:06:29.307
The Christians, I think, are the worst as
far as morality is concerned.

00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:31.737
They have no moral values left in them.

00:06:31.737 --> 00:06:39.866
It’s such a sad thing that the number of
people killed by Christians is also the maximum.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:47.237
Sometimes I think these people who were killed
everywhere might have possessed the Christians

00:06:47.237 --> 00:06:54.506
this way, that they are just going amok and
behaving in this manner, destroying themselves.

00:06:54.506 --> 00:07:03.837
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom.

00:07:03.837 --> 00:07:11.006
And that wisdom gives us the sense how to
behave, gives us the balance, and gives us

00:07:11.006 --> 00:07:22.087
the sense how to behave towards ourselves,
how to preserve yourself, how to respect yourself.

00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:33.957
But if Ganesha is not at all there to watch
you, might be from hell some horrible hellish

00:07:33.957 --> 00:07:38.597
bhoots are coming out, or I don’t know,
I cannot explain this kind of a thing.

00:07:38.597 --> 00:07:45.177
But the other way round, I’ll tell you,
in India, is specially with women, they are

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:52.676
extremely particular about their chastity,
extremely particular.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:08:00.577
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman.

00:08:00.577 --> 00:08:06.957
And one Muslim aggressor who became sultan
heard about her beauty.

00:08:06.957 --> 00:08:11.137
So he wanted to see her.

00:08:11.137 --> 00:08:14.817
So she refused, “I don’t want to see him.”

00:08:14.817 --> 00:08:24.856
Even seeing a woman like that: those bad eyes,
are bad; seeing a woman also, are bad.

00:08:24.856 --> 00:08:31.197
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

00:08:31.197 --> 00:08:37.276
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:38.847
fall on me directly.”

00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:39.947
She agreed to that.

00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:48.746
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that
it was even more beautiful than he had thought

00:08:48.746 --> 00:08:49.907
her to be.

00:08:49.907 --> 00:08:52.146
So now he wanted to have her.

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:56.207
So physical, so superficial.

00:08:56.207 --> 00:09:02.686
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:09.327
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:10.327
or not.”

00:09:10.327 --> 00:09:11.327
So everybody said, “Nothing doing.

00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:13.037
We are not going to surrender.”

00:09:13.037 --> 00:09:23.197
Because the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

00:09:23.197 --> 00:09:28.116
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this.

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:31.026
They could not bear the idea.

00:09:31.026 --> 00:09:38.176
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.”

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:42.706
So they sent a word, “All right, we are
all coming and the queen is coming too.”

00:09:42.706 --> 00:09:44.426
And they sent hundred palanquins.

00:09:44.426 --> 00:09:49.007
We use palanquins for ladies in India, covered.

00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:55.116
And inside every palanquin there was one warrior
sitting with all the weapons.

00:09:55.116 --> 00:10:00.377
And there were four carrying the palanquin,
and all these four were also warriors.

00:10:00.377 --> 00:10:04.676
So thus they have about five hundred warriors.

00:10:04.676 --> 00:10:08.727
It was a small kingdom.

00:10:08.727 --> 00:10:13.067
So when they went down, these people were
very happy.

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:14.067
“The queen is coming.”

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:18.567
and they were all getting drunk and celebrating
it.

00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:19.956
“The queen is coming.

00:10:19.956 --> 00:10:20.956
Queen is coming.”

00:10:20.956 --> 00:10:22.576
So they were half drunk also.

00:10:22.576 --> 00:10:28.886
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:30.987
that we have won.

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:38.186
But if you do not see any thing like that,
then be sure that we have lost the war.”

00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:43.627
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

00:10:43.627 --> 00:10:48.696
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

00:10:48.696 --> 00:10:52.296
king came out and they all fought those people.

00:10:52.296 --> 00:10:57.377
But they were only five hundred so they could
not be saved, and these people had better

00:10:57.377 --> 00:11:00.317
weapons, so they were killed.

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:02.847
They did not lit the fire.

00:11:02.847 --> 00:11:05.106
Now the women knew that all of them will be
coming.

00:11:05.106 --> 00:11:10.696
Now they were very rich sultans, very rich
Muslims, and things like that.

00:11:10.696 --> 00:11:17.436
But they thought that now their chastity is
in danger, so there was a big platform and

00:11:17.436 --> 00:11:19.046
they made a big pyre on that.

00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:29.676
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:37.146
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity.

00:11:37.146 --> 00:11:43.276
And if they do not have the great sense of
chastity, then they develop all kinds of funny

00:11:43.276 --> 00:11:48.486
ideas and mentally they become very imbalanced.

00:11:48.486 --> 00:11:54.627
And the children that they have, also become
very funny and you have all these problems

00:11:54.627 --> 00:11:58.336
of perverted relations, incest relations.

00:11:58.336 --> 00:12:05.097
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

00:12:05.097 --> 00:12:07.557
relationship.

00:12:07.557 --> 00:12:14.667
It’s hell that we have created.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:17.694
In hell what else is going to be?

00:12:19.665 --> 00:12:21.873
Same thing.

00:12:21.944 --> 00:12:26.647
There’s no sanity about it, there’s no
wisdom about it.

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:35.727
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis.

00:12:35.727 --> 00:12:42.386
Men and women, all of them, have to go hand
in hand, because the first quality I told

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:48.380
is wisdom, but the essence of Mooladhara is
innocence.

00:12:48.404 --> 00:12:51.643
They are made of innocence.

00:12:51.877 --> 00:12:54.967
The power of Ganesha is innocence.

00:12:54.967 --> 00:13:00.946
And innocence comes when you do not destroy
it.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:07.047
Actually a child is born innocent, but if
the mother is like that, immediately the child

00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:13.136
takes over and if the father is like that
the son takes over.

00:13:13.136 --> 00:13:17.667
But later on it has effect, whether it’s
mother or father.

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:22.896
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down.

00:13:22.896 --> 00:13:25.307
You can see it so clearly.

00:13:25.307 --> 00:13:35.587
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

00:13:35.587 --> 00:13:42.886
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

00:13:42.886 --> 00:13:51.766
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence.

00:13:51.766 --> 00:13:57.357
And they have built the whole thing in such
a manner that these things never enter into

00:13:57.357 --> 00:13:58.357
our head.

00:13:58.357 --> 00:14:03.227
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”.

00:14:03.227 --> 00:14:08.527
These good conditionings are surrounding us
so much that this never enters into our head,

00:14:08.527 --> 00:14:12.837
all these kind of things that people are doing
here, are mad.

00:14:12.837 --> 00:14:24.797
When it doesn’t enter into your head, we
can say that we just do not allow these possessions

00:14:24.797 --> 00:14:27.646
to come in.

00:14:27.646 --> 00:14:34.636
Because if you make preparation in a way for
these possessions to come in, then the possessions

00:14:34.636 --> 00:14:35.696
will be there.

00:14:35.696 --> 00:14:41.706
Like the way people dress up nowadays, you
see, they look like really witches or bhoots,

00:14:41.706 --> 00:14:42.807
absolutely.

00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:47.886
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:48.897
someone like us.

00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:51.037
Let’s go enter them.”

00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:52.797
Also Agnya is not to be covered.

00:14:52.797 --> 00:14:56.920
I have told a hundred times, please don’t
cover your Agnya, please clear it down.

00:14:57.288 --> 00:14:59.059
Don’t cover your Agnya.

00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:03.829
If you cover your Agnya, then you cannot be
protected.

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:10.752
They enter into your Agnya and from Agnya
they can go up to your Mooladhara.

00:15:10.777 --> 00:15:17.737
So you are living in atmosphere which is very
dangerous for saints to live.

00:15:17.737 --> 00:15:21.387
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya.

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:28.417
If they could say that to Indians, I don’t
know what should I say to people who live

00:15:28.417 --> 00:15:32.843
in such horrible circumstance, absolutely
horrible.

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:40.839
I mean, you think about it, how terrible it
is, and how many problems it gives us; how

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:47.339
many people are ruined, how many children
are ruined, how we go amok.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:56.420
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.610
is innate within us.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.230
It’s not imposed on us, it is innate.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:09.699
A little girl if you see, she’s shy, she
knows how to protect herself.

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:19.860
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to
protect themselves, but that innate innocence

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.370
we try to flout, because ego is there.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.569
“What’s wrong?”

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:30.170
You tell them anything, “What’s wrong?”

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.129
And you do not know how devastating it is.

00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:41.329
In London I know of so many parents telling
Me that their children are already squatting,

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:44.069
they have got already children.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:47.363
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen
they

00:16:47.388 --> 00:16:48.388
have got children.

00:16:54.928 --> 00:17:00.050
And this is so widespread, and so shamelessly
they discuss.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.389
I mean, in the newspaper if you read, I mean
you can’t imagine why to write all these

00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:06.740
things in such details in the newspaper.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:12.540
There’s no need to write each and every
thing in the newspaper.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.930
But basically we are good people.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.680
God has created us good human beings.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:35.829
We are beautiful people, but this ego and
this kind of a stupid idea that, “What’s

00:17:35.829 --> 00:17:41.959
wrong?” in doing anything, coming from ego;
people have gone amok, and when you go amok

00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:47.249
you get caught up by these bhoots, and then
once you are caught up by these bhoots, you

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:51.329
start behaving in a manner that no one can
explain.

00:17:51.329 --> 00:17:53.870
“Why they behave like this?”

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.050
I just don’t understand.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:04.360
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.070
all these jattas, as we call them.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.760
So I asked him, “Why do you dress up like
this?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.709
You look like a primitive man.”

00:18:10.709 --> 00:18:13.009
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.959
I said, “You cannot.

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:16.610
Your brain is modern.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.399
By just making such hair, are you going to
become primitive?

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:23.019
You cannot become primitive.”

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:27.000
But just imagine, all these external things
they do.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.050
For what?

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.680
To have an identity.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:38.060
Now this idea of identity is also is a sign
that you do not have your maryadas.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.060
You can do anything.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.300
You can become a punk and all kinds of things
you do.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.060
I mean, there are no maryadas.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.180
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:56.130
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately
within us.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:19:01.300
Even a prostitute in India, if she has to
take to that profession because she’s forced

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:07.180
into it, maybe she’s been brought from somewhere
or maybe that out of her big problems she

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:12.470
might have been a prostitute; she will see
that her child is saved.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.889
She knows that it’s wrong.

00:19:13.889 --> 00:19:18.199
But here it is so bad that we do not know
also that it is wrong.

00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:24.160
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.279
water and you know that you are going to be
killed.

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:30.939
Still you are enjoying, “Very nice, I am
going to be killed.”

00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:33.749
This is the situation of the wisdom.

00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:36.649
This is really shocking.

00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:41.950
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:47.899
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha.

00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:51.269
For that the best is to meditate.

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:58.819
Put yourself on some nice turf, grass.

00:19:58.819 --> 00:19:59.819
Sit on that.

00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:07.589
Put your left hand with the light, and right
hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva

00:20:07.589 --> 00:20:08.660
Sheersha.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.249
If you can remember it by heart, it’s a
very good thing.

00:20:11.249 --> 00:20:17.360
Otherwise, you can keep the book and read
it, or say Ganesha’s mantra to begin with.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.559
It’s going to help you very much.

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:24.589
It’s going to help you, your eyes, it’s
going to your whole thing, is going to be

00:20:24.589 --> 00:20:26.559
very nice.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:34.220
And also with this kind of a mad Mooladhara,
a woman can become extremely aggressive with

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.220
her husband.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.150
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.630
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.520
I mean, I never used to think women could
be cruel, really.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:57.310
I mean they could be sly, they could be sort
of, doing some scandal-mongering or some sort

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.460
of stupid things like that.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:06.410
But that a woman should be a cruel woman…
when I first read the history of England I

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:12.180
was surprised that there were some queens
who were very cruel, and also that there were

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.510
seven queens who were killed.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:23.153
In India if a king kills even one queen, he’ll
be ousted completely from the whole country.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.755
So it’s not a

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.660
something very simple thing.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.350
It’s very serious.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:29.470
For Sahaja yogis very, very serious.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:36.220
They have to revive their innocence.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.530
They have to revive their maryadas.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.580
They have to delimit themselves.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.120
It’s very important.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:53.170
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.680
the heights?

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.340
You have to put them into some bags, some
maryadas.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:04.340
Only by maryadas you can rise.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.850
Of course the kundalini will help.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.270
Of course Ganesha will help also.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.470
But we should also try to watch ourselves.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:19.670
There should be introspection, “Are we still
in the same category?”

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:27.990
I have told many people that it is better
you walk with your eyes towards the grass,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:33.230
at only at three feet, because at three feet
you can only see children, flowers and grounds,

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.790
not higher than that.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.460
Nothing very beautiful is beyond that I think.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:48.779
Or raise much higher, so that you just see
above the heads of people, nothing in between.

00:23:48.804 --> 00:24:00.096
And our whole style, lifestyle is so funny;
I mean, I just don’t know how to explain

00:24:00.121 --> 00:24:03.370
it, but is accepted.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:10.800
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.880
one sin, so I must tell you.”

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880
I said, “What?”

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.800
“In my family nobody takes beer, but I am
taking beer sometimes.”

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:26.709
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say.

00:24:26.734 --> 00:24:32.940
Very seriously he said, “You are Mother,
so I must confess to You, but now I will never

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.001
touch beer.”

00:24:34.026 --> 00:24:35.510
Imagine.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:41.590
Very seriously he was talking, and another
fellow came, he has told Me.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.360
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.360
What is it?

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.570
You are all making money?”

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.060
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.190
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.100
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.100
Why not?”

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.230
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…”

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:06.420
With very great hesitation, he said that,
“You see, mostly it is not advertised in

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:11.800
Indian papers, and we Indians think that we
are rather of a different species, you see,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.970
how are we going to fit in with these people
because, you see, their ideas are so different,

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.270
ours are so different, and how are we going
to fit in with them?

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.300
It’s very difficult.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.150
But this time I saw some Indians also and
some Indian musicians singing, so it seems

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.830
that we can fit into them.”

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:34.310
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.310
It’s easy.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.310
They are your style only.”

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:41.100
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.360
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.760
India is like that, you see.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.490
They think you are of a different bottle and
they are of a different bottle.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.670
So you are like that and they are like that.

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:58.860
They cannot be like you and you cannot be
like them, so they think it is a different

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.480
bottle you belong to, you see, different category
of people.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.630
But they don’t think that you are bad or
good, they don’t pass judgment.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:13.010
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.580
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:24.740
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.130
on the soil of Shri Ganesha.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.830
To all the Sahaja yogis, you must show.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:38.630
But, as you know what, we had horrible experiences
so far, and how people have been dominating

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:48.780
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
money-wise and otherwise also morality-wise.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:57.700
So it sometimes upsets the whole balance of
Sahaja Yoga because it’s all depending on

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:04.020
Shri Ganesha; that means depending on Australians.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:12.280
And Australians have all the possibility of
reaching a great height in Ganesh principle,

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.030
because they have the Mother Earth here sitting
down.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:19.120
What else do they want?

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.720
You need not take to stupid American-style
things.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.260
I mean, if you see their Hallowe’en, I tell
you, you won’t eat your food for eight days.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:34.850
And if you go only to Rio, even you do not
visit their carnivals, but even if you see

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:39.950
the pictures, you won’t eat your food for
one month, so horrible they are.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:50.190
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.730
special people?

00:27:52.730 --> 00:28:04.640
Or, this I have to warn you, and people are
all watching all over, all Sahaja yogis are

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.040
there; you know that all over the world we
have Sahaja yogis.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:15.270
They’re watching everyone, and you have
to do your maximum to express your Ganesh

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:20.400
principle, which should be very easy for you.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.070
And as I have told you, that Australia was
a part and parcel of India once upon a time.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.620
It has come down here.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:33.320
So, at least in your films and all that, you
can say they’re dharmic, they are dharmic.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:41.830
They’re not so bad as the American films
are, but still this idea of copying the French

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.240
or the Americans shows that we have lost our
personality.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.290
But Shri Ganesha gives you a personality.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.090
He gives you your personality, because He
gives you maryadas.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.170
You see, by maryadas only, you get your personality.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.200
A person is known by his maryadas.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.660
And that’s what has to come within us, are
our maryadas.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.700
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:13.110
As of course you know, He has got four petals
and you know what He is placed in and what

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.240
He does and all that, and how He looks after
the chastity of His Mother and all that.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:25.120
But the main thing is that how we develop
Shri Ganesha within us, how people see us

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.570
as the incarnations of innocence on this Earth.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:38.740
I know it’s very difficult, but imagine
Shri Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:45.770
of excretion, because He’s just like a lotus,
above everything else, and He makes everything

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:46.810
fragrant.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:53.740
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:03.790
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.760
the Sahaja yogis, and then among all the world.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.968
May God bless you.
