00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:18.314
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good

00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:23.864
and after all the good prevails.

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:37.596
In these modern times, evil used to prevail on good but now in this Krita Yuga,

00:04:37.596 --> 00:04:49.627
the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not only that, but good will spread all over.

00:05:00.974 --> 00:05:16.205
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:29.829
Because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil.

00:05:31.887 --> 00:05:39.441
If they could see the good they would give up their evil.

00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:48.218
In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints,

00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:54.384
I was amazed to hear what people are up to.

00:05:54.394 --> 00:06:03.125
One of the real source of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

00:06:03.135 --> 00:06:11.684
he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all

00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:18.324
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:26.115
with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:36.154
They want to establish that science is everything.

00:06:36.164 --> 00:06:44.845
We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality.

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:54.055
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

00:06:54.065 --> 00:07:03.725
Nobody has made any special inventions and the way people are organising it in the name

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:09.535
of science, there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:16.834
So it’s the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:22.891
Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent.

00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:28.379
They have not discarded everything that was spiritual.

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:35.146
But here they have gone headlong, those few people who are there, very, very few, but they are there.

00:07:35.146 --> 00:07:43.286
So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:47.024
because this country is so full of spirituality.

00:07:47.024 --> 00:07:54.557
In the West, because people took to science, they have lost all culture of society.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:58.534
There is no culture of society.

00:07:58.534 --> 00:08:05.034
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon or how you wish each other.

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:06.916
There is no other culture.

00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:10.756
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep really.

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:18.368
Because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that

00:08:18.368 --> 00:08:33.069
it's the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality.

00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:43.128
The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality.

00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:56.775
Science cannot talk of this and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them.

00:08:56.775 --> 00:09:11.838
Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading Power.

00:09:11.838 --> 00:09:18.419
Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:21.567
So, under these circumstances I find

00:09:21.567 --> 00:09:33.025
that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much  for establishing goodness.

00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:38.785
You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself

00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:42.120
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.760
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.572
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached,

00:09:55.572 --> 00:09:58.571
detached from any things which create problems.

00:09:58.571 --> 00:10:09.089
If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of

00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:19.229
a life that will nourish your society which is now sick, is a sick society, is a decadent society.

00:10:19.229 --> 00:10:25.613
And for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong,

00:10:25.613 --> 00:10:32.337
who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:38.847
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common.

00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:43.745
And so much involved into their personal problems that

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:54.019
I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint of view.

00:10:54.404 --> 00:11:00.314
So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much

00:11:00.314 --> 00:11:06.891
due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment

00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:11.217
from spirituality which is in India. No doubt.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:18.066
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:24.003
Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

00:11:24.003 --> 00:11:29.919
It has to sprout and it has to show results, which we are showing no doubt.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:34.205
In so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that,

00:11:34.205 --> 00:11:37.580
though they are rather slow about that point.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.836
So, it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow,

00:11:42.836 --> 00:11:47.735
Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality,

00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:56.233
and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:03.495
Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:07.123
it’s not going to work out.

00:12:07.123 --> 00:12:13.969
So I hope as we have circulated letters that we have come here

00:12:13.969 --> 00:12:22.565
not for fun but for dedication and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:32.637
Talking loose, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other

00:12:32.637 --> 00:12:38.993
is out of question of course. But domination, terrible domination

00:12:38.993 --> 00:12:43.883
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

00:12:43.883 --> 00:12:51.123
or, "Why is he leader?" you know, shows that we are not yet worthy.

00:12:51.123 --> 00:12:58.583
So, the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

00:12:58.583 --> 00:13:05.447
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy

00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:10.624
and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across.

00:13:10.624 --> 00:13:13.528
In the same way, if you have to be something,

00:13:13.528 --> 00:13:17.801
you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:24.441
of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you.

00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:32.678
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:36.745
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:36.745 --> 00:13:42.670
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.375
there’s nothing to hide.

00:13:45.385 --> 00:13:54.047
And you have to go and open the doors

00:13:54.047 --> 00:14:03.108
of many churches and many temples and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:07.008
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious.

00:14:07.449 --> 00:14:12.429
First, I used to say, "I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

00:14:12.429 --> 00:14:14.365
let us work it out."

00:14:14.365 --> 00:14:17.863
But it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them,

00:14:17.863 --> 00:14:21.819
very openly, I am going to say them.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:24.836
But I want all of you to be such

00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:35.739
that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, "Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:35.739 --> 00:14:39.870
And how this Sahaja Yogi is behaving."

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:48.022
If somebody is stupid and not working it out, it's better to get rid of such a person.

00:14:48.022 --> 00:14:52.806
Or else help that person and tell him that, "You have to come up.

00:14:52.806 --> 00:14:56.468
You can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here.

00:14:56.468 --> 00:15:03.296
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

00:15:03.296 --> 00:15:06.334
The purity is the main point which we have to have.

00:15:06.334 --> 00:15:09.935
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you.

00:15:09.935 --> 00:15:17.911
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:23.665
When it works out, you’ll be surprised collectivity will grow in no time.

00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:30.561
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still, to go back to the same materialism

00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:36.706
and to try to have your own house, your family, your
children- sort of a nonsense.

00:15:36.706 --> 00:15:41.414
We have to be in the ashrams and we have to work it out,

00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:46.126
we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashram.

00:15:46.205 --> 00:15:53.135
But I find still people cannot work it out that way.

00:15:54.275 --> 00:15:57.988
They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things.

00:15:57.988 --> 00:16:01.788
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that you get everything.

00:16:02.022 --> 00:16:10.432
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:13.022
So, tremendous sacrifice is needed.

00:16:13.022 --> 00:16:16.768
Of course, as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:24.303
but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have.

00:16:25.042 --> 00:16:28.384
In every way we have to show that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

00:16:28.384 --> 00:16:32.203
The way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave,

00:16:32.203 --> 00:16:34.459
the way you have relationships with each other

00:16:34.459 --> 00:16:37.137
and the way you lead your married life

00:16:37.137 --> 00:16:42.109
and the way you look at your children.

00:16:43.914 --> 00:16:49.476
Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine,

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:52.656
the light of love will not shine.

00:16:52.656 --> 00:16:58.015
You have to absorb the light of love within yourself.

00:16:58.205 --> 00:17:02.136
But you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality.

00:17:02.136 --> 00:17:09.973
And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years.

00:17:09.973 --> 00:17:13.813
In ten years we can change the whole world,
in ten years!

00:17:13.813 --> 00:17:16.525
But you have to be really very dedicated.

00:17:22.418 --> 00:17:27.079
It is you who has to change, not Me.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.959
You have to work it out, not Me.

00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:37.211
I have done my level best but within ten years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

00:17:37.211 --> 00:17:40.790
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.300
So, please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:50.452
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them,

00:17:50.452 --> 00:17:53.216
all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

00:17:53.216 --> 00:17:57.695
You don’t have to be very mild on this point.

00:17:57.695 --> 00:18:04.426
You have to tell them frankly that, "See now, you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:04.426 --> 00:18:07.710
It's not meant for mediocres.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.739
It's not meant for foolish people, it's not meant for stupid people,

00:18:11.739 --> 00:18:19.199
it’s meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth.“

00:18:19.378 --> 00:18:23.748
These people are saying that, "Why don’t you go the way of science?"

00:18:23.748 --> 00:18:28.456
I say, "Why don’t you go the way of truth?"

00:18:28.456 --> 00:18:30.656
Take to truth.

00:18:30.656 --> 00:18:35.378
Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

00:18:35.975 --> 00:18:39.877
Today you may think it is correct but every hypothesis is challenged,

00:18:39.877 --> 00:18:44.641
every law is challenged, that’s no law.

00:18:45.034 --> 00:18:48.757
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life, everywhere.

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:51.377
But in no way you have to be fanatic about it.

00:18:51.499 --> 00:18:56.701
Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations

00:18:56.701 --> 00:19:02.875
or they start moving their hands for bandhans,

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.684
even if I am sitting, they are doing like that.

00:19:05.684 --> 00:19:13.484
There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous.

00:19:15.234 --> 00:19:20.760
But for that we need really people of quality.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.227
And a complete obedience is needed I must say.

00:19:25.788 --> 00:19:31.811
I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them.

00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:35.011
They just didn’t listen to Me that time, they said, "Mother, why do you want,

00:19:35.011 --> 00:19:37.419
you know, you'll be in trouble and all that".

00:19:37.602 --> 00:19:42.182
If they had listened to Me there would have been no trouble today.

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:48.511
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.291
but I know everything you know that.

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:55.724
I know everything.

00:19:55.941 --> 00:20:00.141
Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages.

00:20:00.141 --> 00:20:04.801
But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about.

00:20:05.915 --> 00:20:11.265
It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that.

00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:15.409
It’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage, that’s why.

00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:18.269
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:26.521
But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.708
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:32.036 --> 00:20:37.006
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife, you will not fall,

00:20:37.006 --> 00:20:39.899
whatever may be the quality of your husband, you will not fall.

00:20:40.078 --> 00:20:49.315
So one has to be little concerned that: what are we doing?

00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:51.836
What have we achieved?

00:20:52.205 --> 00:20:57.964
What are we going to give to the world?

00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:08.225
For Me, you are my instruments. I don’t have to ask anybody else.

00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:11.817
You are my instruments and you have to work it out.

00:21:11.817 --> 00:21:17.308
You are not for Me useless people, I worked very hard with you, very hard.

00:21:17.459 --> 00:21:20.840
So please don’t waste my energies also

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:27.359
and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible,

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:33.724
in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something

00:21:33.724 --> 00:21:35.694
of very great qualities.

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:40.255
Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there is a violence on.

00:21:40.255 --> 00:21:45.694
Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared

00:21:45.694 --> 00:21:51.627
to be very strong people, very strong,

00:21:51.627 --> 00:21:53.397
and that will work out I’m sure.

00:21:53.397 --> 00:21:59.295
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report

00:21:59.295 --> 00:22:01.902
and very few people were hurt.

00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:04.205
What does that mean?

00:22:04.205 --> 00:22:09.374
That there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:18.144
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided we will not go to Atith

00:22:18.144 --> 00:22:22.767
because there are- the commissioner, the ESP told Me that it is better not to go,

00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:26.183
it's very- these people are very bad and they are criminals.

00:22:26.183 --> 00:22:30.073
So, now until the election comes in, they will be behaving like this manner.

00:22:30.363 --> 00:22:33.508
After the election of course they will be put down.

00:22:33.508 --> 00:22:40.014
So you should go by the understanding of the time and

00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:44.944
directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you can do shopping whatever you like

00:22:44.944 --> 00:22:51.144
and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

00:22:51.144 --> 00:22:55.530
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.805
It is our development.

00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:04.920
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same, empty handed.

00:23:05.425 --> 00:23:11.243
I want you, everyone, to be extremely active in your own sphere of life,

00:23:11.243 --> 00:23:12.233
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:12.233 --> 00:23:17.742
You must wear my badges, you must wear my rings, you must wear my necklaces

00:23:17.742 --> 00:23:24.114
so that people ask you “Who is this?” Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”.

00:23:24.114 --> 00:23:27.469
You can say, "We think she is the Holy Ghost".

00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:29.775
Let us see what happens.

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:37.892
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I have to talk to you

00:23:37.892 --> 00:23:44.295
and that we have to be very, very careful about how we look at ourselves.

00:23:44.295 --> 00:23:48.594
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening.

00:23:48.594 --> 00:23:52.438
I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are

00:23:52.438 --> 00:23:53.573
and what is happening.

00:23:53.573 --> 00:23:59.992
But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:06.007
So, there has to be awareness and with your awareness the light will spread.

00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:09.377
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it.

00:24:11.436 --> 00:24:17.151
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent, all your light has to talk,

00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:23.621
the light has to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:31.550
Let us see now after going from this tour how far people establish new things.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:38.195
So far, what my own opinion is,  that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis

00:24:38.195 --> 00:24:41.906
in the West are still quite mediocre

00:24:41.906 --> 00:24:46.029
and 25% of them are just there to take advantage.

00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:49.466
If they can get something free, they would like to do it.

00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:51.877
25% people are like that.

00:24:51.877 --> 00:24:55.259
It’s very sad but it is so.

00:24:55.259 --> 00:25:00.532
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything,

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:04.285
they will never take anything free from Me, nothing.

00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:07.160
They will not, they are very self-respecting.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.591
And that is what we have to develop, that self-respect.

00:25:10.415 --> 00:25:15.126
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free.

00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:18.699
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody goes,

00:25:18.699 --> 00:25:22.694
who has no job goes and stays there. It’s such a nonsensical thing.

00:25:22.694 --> 00:25:27.841
So, I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London because same thing will start.

00:25:27.841 --> 00:25:30.997
If they can take advantage they would like to be there.

00:25:30.997 --> 00:25:33.708
Even a spoon they would like to carry like that.

00:25:33.943 --> 00:25:37.462
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think.

00:25:37.612 --> 00:25:46.422
We have to have full self-respect and we must understand that we have to sacrifice, to do something about it.

00:25:48.677 --> 00:25:52.560
Because this is the last leg, I would say, when I will be talking to you about all these things

00:25:52.560 --> 00:26:01.531
and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river.

00:26:02.298 --> 00:26:08.950
We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound,

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.055
it makes a sound to show that she- it exists.

00:26:13.973 --> 00:26:21.293
But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are.

00:26:21.584 --> 00:26:29.665
And our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:37.838
It is time that we should watch ourselves and see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

00:26:37.838 --> 00:26:39.241
Very important.

00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:45.449
I had to say this once again and again,

00:26:45.449 --> 00:26:49.287
but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much

00:26:49.287 --> 00:26:53.168
and I care for you so much and you people also love Me.

00:26:53.168 --> 00:26:57.268
But loving Me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.949
Only your Self is going to work out.

00:27:00.184 --> 00:27:03.783
As Shivaji Maharaj said, "Swa-dharma rajya"

00:27:03.783 --> 00:27:09.038
"You must develop the religion of your Spirit".

00:27:09.329 --> 00:27:14.231
That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit.

00:27:14.231 --> 00:27:23.606
And once it happens, we can get the whole world completely emancipated.

00:27:23.606 --> 00:27:30.308
This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else

00:27:30.308 --> 00:27:37.238
So, for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me.

00:27:40.205 --> 00:27:46.205
For a small thing people react, for a small thing they feel bad.

00:27:46.205 --> 00:27:50.014
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

00:27:50.014 --> 00:27:53.701
In little, little things they feel bad and they react.

00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:56.177
If I say anything, they react.

00:27:56.177 --> 00:27:58.407
So how can anything go into you?

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.750
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb it?

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:09.278
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

00:28:09.278 --> 00:28:12.592
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti,

00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:15.517
you have had photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti.

00:28:15.517 --> 00:28:17.665
But how much are we absorbing?

00:28:17.665 --> 00:28:19.663
How much we are taking within ourselves?

00:28:19.663 --> 00:28:24.415
This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do.

00:28:24.415 --> 00:28:29.282
It's much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s.

00:28:29.713 --> 00:28:33.698
So create such great people among you.

00:28:33.698 --> 00:28:39.722
Because I have the power, only thing, you have to have the absorption power,

00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:41.398
the acceptability.

00:28:41.398 --> 00:28:47.229
But if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

00:28:48.052 --> 00:28:56.759
You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in, whatever is emitting from my being.

00:28:56.759 --> 00:29:00.194
I hope now you all will take it up seriously.

00:29:00.194 --> 00:29:03.484
Do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time.

00:29:03.484 --> 00:29:10.045
Every morning we have to do the meditation and we have to see that we finish our work in the night

00:29:10.045 --> 00:29:13.393
and then we do little meditation and then sleep off.

00:29:13.393 --> 00:29:20.146
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning,

00:29:20.146 --> 00:29:24.106
do your meditation and then you can take to your work.

00:29:24.106 --> 00:29:26.825
Daytime if you want, you can rest for a while.

00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:30.933
Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while,

00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:34.060
but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.427
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy.

00:29:38.427 --> 00:29:43.377
Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that

00:29:43.377 --> 00:29:47.356
and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that.

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:53.109
If I can manage at this age, at your age you should be able to manage something like that.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.311
We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

00:29:58.573 --> 00:30:03.447
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

00:30:03.963 --> 00:30:10.483
I wish all of you absorb my saying and understand it without reacting to it.

00:30:10.483 --> 00:30:11.866
Please do not react.

00:30:11.866 --> 00:30:14.694
Don’t think, "Mother is trying to chastise you". No.

00:30:14.694 --> 00:30:19.955
I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

00:30:19.955 --> 00:30:23.639
So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

00:30:23.639 --> 00:30:25.058
May God bless you all.

00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:30.157
I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
