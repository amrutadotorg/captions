1
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:07,890
I am sure somebody must have spoken before,
no?

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,799
All right.

3
00:00:10,799 --> 00:00:20,720
You all have been seeking, and seeking the
truth about yourself.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,550
Where does the truth lie?

5
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:33,920
When are we the most truthful people?

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:43,170
Where, at what point, we cannot deceive, whatever
we may try?

7
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,750
When it is heartfelt.

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:01:06,150
When it is our heart’s desire, then we always
try to go ahead with it.

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,830
But it has to be heart’s desire not the
rationality, not the brain’s desire.

10
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,710
Because you can make your brain understand.

11
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,070
Your intelligence can be compromised.

12
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,750
Whatever is heartfelt you want to do it.

13
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:35,399
You cannot be satisfied without doing it.

14
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,610
So, in the heart lies the truth.

15
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,570
That is the Spirit that lies in your heart.

16
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,610
But that is not in our conscious mind.

17
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,840
We do not know how it manifests.

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:11,459
We have heard that it is eternal, indestructible,
is the source of joy and is the attention

19
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,629
of God.

20
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,519
That’s what we have heard.

21
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:28,030
All such things which are preached may be
regarded as hearsays.

22
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:39,030
People might say, “What’s the proof that
there is a Spirit in our heart?”

23
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:49,790
Thank God, people have discovered the heart
at least there, if not the Spirit!

24
00:02:49,790 --> 00:03:01,180
How are we to believe that there is Spirit
– that we have a dimension which is beyond

25
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,489
this human dimension, which is the dimension
of the Spirit, the Spiritual dimension – by

26
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,720
which we can feel the All-pervading Power
of Divine love?

27
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:21,940
It’s all being told to us by all the priests
of all the religions.

28
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,720
Now where is that Spirit?

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,110
Whether it resides in the heart or where?

30
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,200
How are we to know?

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,230
How are we to believe?

32
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,390
Or are we to deny all those people?

33
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,370
Did they tell us lies about it?

34
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,519
They may say, “You imagine, now, [that]
your awareness is that of the Spirit."

35
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,760
By imagination you are not there!

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,379
It’s just an imagination.

37
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,080
Suddenly you find it was just a bubble and
whole thing has burst off.

38
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:08,489
So today the questioning mind comes to a point,
to inquire: is there something called Spirit

39
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,569
that we have to identify with?

40
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:24,570
This inquiry itself is a seeking, because
you also do not know what is the meaning of

41
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,470
your life?

42
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,790
You also do not know why you were made a human
being?

43
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:40,540
What was the need for the nature to create
human beings on this Earth?

44
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:50,670
Why they took so much time to create it, evolve
us to this stage where we are called as human

45
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,820
beings?

46
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,380
Nobody asked the question why: the scientists
do not.

47
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,930
Also the people who are so called religious
do not ask the question why, they just believed

48
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,090
in it, “Have faith!

49
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,470
Have faith!

50
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,940
Faith is the only way you can go to God."

51
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,290
Blind faith!

52
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,920
That’s a good consolation, just a consolation
for the heart, “Oh, I have faith in this

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,850
and this."

54
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:39,420
But tomorrow our children will ask us, I mean,
they are already asking: “What is all this

55
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,560
going about?

56
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,290
Why you are wasting your time and our time
in all this useless things?”

57
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:56,220
And they are going to ask: “Is there any
truth in, what you are saying?

58
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,060
I s there God?”

59
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,430
So, a long time back people decided: “Forget
God!

60
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,560
Turn your back.

61
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,350
That question is a mystery.

62
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,350
Forget it.

63
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,960
Let’s start something else."

64
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,040
So they started science, this that.

65
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,170
Science is nothing but whatever is there you
just say, with these gross eyes human eyes

66
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:31,500
you see, now a hall like this, and a carpet
and all that you see whatever you see you

67
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,760
just say, “This is it, this is it."

68
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:41,430
The laws of science are also whatever they
see, experimented, whatever is discovered

69
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
because it exists.

70
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,780
So whatever they have discovered it is the
science.

71
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:55,630
But there may be something they have not been
able to discover, something beyond; and could

72
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:04,440
be always, because every theory they put up
is challenged, every new thought they put

73
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,220
in is challenged, even whatever are accepted
as Newton’s Law, and all that, are challenged

74
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,870
today.

75
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,700
So everything is challenged and human beings
are just confused.

76
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:26,350
They can’t understand, whether there is
some truth in it or not.

77
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:36,840
In this era of confusion seekers are born,
these are the seekers of the truth.

78
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:44,510
It’s a rare category, used to be very rare
before, not in this age of course.

79
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,830
In this age there are many, they are really
seekers.

80
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,040
Of course, some could be, just out of the
fashion, seekers; because, “Everybody is

81
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,640
a seeker all right, everybody is a hippy I
become a hippy."

82
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,050
“They are all going on those skates; let
me also buy some skates!”

83
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,160
It’s like that.

84
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,420
But some are really seekers.

85
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,690
They may do some guru shopping they may go
wrong.

86
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,190
They may have a little fun here and there.

87
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,180
They may try to go to places where their ego
is pampered and they may like to spend some

88
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,131
money if they have some extra money inherited
or something; like putting it on a horse (gambling)

89
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,430
they may put it for their Spiritual life.

90
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,919
Anything is possible.

91
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:41,550
But one has to understand: why are we seeking?

92
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,560
Again the ‘why’.

93
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:52,340
Of course, because we do not know the meaning
of our life.

94
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:58,100
But maybe that we have evolved to this state
and we have to evolve to some higher state.

95
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:10,610
Like the fishes who were in the sea were quite
happy, but one or two of them started seeking

96
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:17,020
something else, so they came out of the sea
and started seeking.

97
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:24,010
And they became turtles or reptiles and the
evolution started moving further.

98
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:35,460
We have not yet reached the epitome, or we
can say the climax, of our evolution because

99
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,830
we do not know our meaning.

100
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:48,170
For example now, this instrument as it is
you see: to a lay person like me it will be

101
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:57,990
difficult to guess what it is for and even
to a person who knows what it is it will be

102
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:05,220
difficult to play it if he does not know and
a person, who also knows how to play, it will

103
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,410
be difficult to play if it is not connected
to the mains.

104
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:22,460
So we can say there are people of four types
in this world.

105
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:31,400
Out of them, the seekers are the one who are
just ready to be connected to the mains.

106
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,710
They are a type.

107
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:45,600
As soon as they are connected to the mains
they start manifesting themselves very well.

108
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,870
Immediately they start understanding Sahaj
Yog.

109
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,540
‘Sahaja’: ‘saha’ means ‘with’,
‘ja’ means ‘born’ – is born with

110
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,960
you.

111
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:05,660
This right to be in union with God, that is
yoga, is born with you.

112
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:16,730
.And this Sahaja, this spontaneous happening,
takes place more in a seeker than in a non-seeker.

113
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:30,960
And the one who knows how to play this instrument
is the one who can connect.

114
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,140
The second one is the one who wants to know
how to play it, will be the first to know

115
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,860
how to play it.

116
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:47,270
But those who do not want who are not interested,
those who just come to show off, those who

117
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:58,340
are not seekers, they may be some big people,
may be kings and queens and may be anything,

118
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,570
they might be priests, they might be anything
but those who do not want to know about their

119
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,250
Spirit are difficult, are extremely difficult.

120
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,980
It’s a headache.

121
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,150
Sometimes they feel they are going to oblige
Sahaj Yoga, by coming to Sahaj Yog.

122
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:25,110
It’s just the other way round: Sahaj Yoga
is a very receding force – it judges you

123
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,990
very much.

124
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,560
This evolution takes place in people who want
to know, who want to get into it.

125
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,900
Imagine of the fishes who came out of the
water, they can’t live without water.

126
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:52,350
To come out of water and to find their new
ways of life, new understanding of the soil,

127
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,450
was very difficult.

128
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:01,860
Though Sahaj Yoga is not difficult at all.

129
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:11,170
Once you get your Realisation, once the Kundalini
rises, when she pierces your fontanel bone,

130
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:17,270
when you get your baptism, when it passes
through various chakras and enlightens your

131
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:27,250
different centres, you get all the blessings
of this power within you which is resting,

132
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:36,430
sleeping; which you can awaken and use it.

133
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:45,170
When this power rises, She cools you down
completely.

134
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,790
She’s so blissful.

135
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,740
She’s compassion.

136
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,770
She forgives.

137
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,150
There are people who think, “Oh Mother,
we have committed so many sins!”

138
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,150
It’s nothing!

139
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,040
She just forgives.

140
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,060
Forgiving is her nature.

141
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,420
She has to forgive.

142
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,750
She finds her own way.

143
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,230
She enlightens all the chakras by itself.

144
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,640
It’s your own mother!

145
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,430
Sleeping for days together, years together,
ages together, lives together.

146
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:22,530
And She rises, She rises and She pierces this
area.

147
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:31,040
And you become a different person all together,
like an egg becoming a bird, you become a

148
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
bird.

149
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Your awareness is different.

150
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,370
A bird has a different awareness from an egg’s
awareness.

151
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:47,589
And that is the real second birth, is not
that you just certify yourself, “Oh, I am

152
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:48,600
born again!”

153
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,550
There are people who are going around [saying],
“We are born again!”

154
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,490
I said, “Who says so?”

155
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,650
“Yes we are!”

156
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,650
“But how?

157
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,290
What is the proof that you are born again?”

158
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,530
If you are going to live with myths, if you
are going to live with untruth, you can go

159
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,830
ahead.

160
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:08,980
Nobody can stop you, you have freedom.

161
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,990
You have freedom to do what you like; whatever
things you want to do you can do it and learn

162
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:20,770
from your mistakes, errors.

163
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,980
Nobody can stop you.

164
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,340
That’s your freedom: once granted is granted
forever.

165
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:32,120
I mean if somebody wants to take two running
jumps and go to hell how can you stop it?

166
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,720
You cannot stop it.

167
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:45,480
Its only you, when you get your Realisation,
then you know that, where is the Spirit.

168
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,130
You know that you are the Spirit.

169
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:56,520
You know it within yourself, not just the
rational mind tells you, “Oh I am the Spirit,”

170
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,300
just to believe, “I am the Spirit."

171
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,510
It’s not that, but you start manifesting
your Spirit and manifestation of the Spirit

172
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,080
gives you complete enlightenment within because
you can feel your centres on your fingers.

173
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,820
Normally you don’t feel, you don’t know
what centres you have.

174
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,610
Even a child can feel the centres on the fingers.

175
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,810
Even the person who cannot speak, who is deaf,
can feel these centres.

176
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:45,210
All these seven felt centres you can feel:
not only of your own but of others.

177
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:57,060
As you grow in your knowledge [of] how to
use this new power then you can cure others

178
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,340
of their various problems of the chakras and
you can give them Realisation too!

179
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,450
You can do it.

180
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:13,760
It’s your own Spirit that is going to work
out: is the manifestation of your own Spirit.

181
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,750
Then you know the knowledge, you know the
truth.

182
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:27,150
Embodying all the truths is one truth is that
you are instrument of God and the power of

183
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:36,929
Divine love start flowing through you and
you can know what is that power through feeling

184
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:48,850
it in your conscious mind, not only that but
you can manoeuvre it, you can master it.

185
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,270
This is what one has to expect of Self-realisation.

186
00:17:52,270 --> 00:18:01,430
Not a certificate, not just a book, not just
a receipt that: “I have paid so many pounds

187
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,809
to someone."

188
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:08,940
It’s the certificate that you have to give
yourself very truthfully.

189
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,929
Your own truthfulness is challenged in Sahaj
Yoga.

190
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:15,100
You cannot lie.

191
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:22,390
When you get your Realisation you do feel
it, and if you do not get it you just do not

192
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,390
get it.

193
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:27,590
Nobody can force Realisation on you.

194
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,170
One can help.

195
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,710
For example now there are so many Sahaj Yogis
today here, sitting, very beautiful people.

196
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:41,820
They are outwardly just like you, but from
their hand this power is flowing and they

197
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:50,740
know how to manoeuvre, how to give power to
your aura, to your Kundalini to invite her,

198
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,460
because they are enlightened ones and the
enlighten ones can enlighten the unenlightened

199
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
ones.

200
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,850
And once the unenlightened are also enlightened
they can do the same thing to others after

201
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,970
learning the method how to do it.

202
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,370
But before that, you are naïve; you do not
know anything about it.

203
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:21,790
So far whatever you have known, if it was
of any value you would have been there.

204
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,309
But you do not know and one should not feel
bad about it.

205
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:29,900
Because we are born like that: we are to be
born again.

206
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:36,220
There’s nothing wrong in being born as human
beings and then to be born again.

207
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,380
Only human beings can be born again, not animals.

208
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,280
So there’s nothing to feel bad about it.

209
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,450
Some people get hurt when they find other
Sahaj Yogis are working on them.

210
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:59,990
But tomorrow the same Sahaj Yogis, you will
be amazed, will be helping you very much to

211
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:06,310
sustain your Realisation and then you will
become a Sahaj Yogi and you will start doing

212
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,710
it.

213
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,830
And then the whole priorities will change
because the joy of your Spirit is so great,

214
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:22,150
is so tremendous, that you would not like
to lose it and it flows through your fingers

215
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:28,530
like cool breeze and that’s the indication
that you are all right and Spirit is manifesting.

216
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,750
But when you displease the Spirit you will
immediately know that the vibrations have

217
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,060
stopped.

218
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:40,490
Any question, any fundamental question like,
“Is there God?”

219
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:49,700
If you ask, immediately the vibrations will
start coming with great power, showing that,

220
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,320
“Yes, there is God."

221
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,720
Your computer starts working.

222
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,900
It is so amazing, it is so amazing, because
you do not know that you are a computer.

223
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:09,710
It would be like a television set, suddenly
brought to some villagers and you start it,

224
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,930
they say, “What, it looked like a box, ordinary
box and what has started?

225
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,010
There’s some pictures have started coming
into it?”

226
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:24,210
In the same way you are made that way specially,
by God Almighty – if you want I will call

227
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,010
it Nature – and now you have become that.

228
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:33,890
So becoming is the main point in the Sahaj
Yoga and not just lecturing and talking about

229
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,890
it.

230
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,490
You may hear all my lectures there are – I
don’t know how many, hundreds – you may

231
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,540
do anything you like [but] nothing will go
into your head or into your heart unless and

232
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,730
until you have Realisation.

233
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,970
It can only mean to you that, yes there is
way of doing it and all that, but unless and

234
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,880
until you have actualised it, it is useless,
everything is useless for you.

235
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,470
So it is the actualisation it’s the real
happening one should ask for.

236
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,530
And if it happens to you, you should know
that God has blessed you specially.

237
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:19,340
There are very few people in this world – I
found when I was born – who were realised-souls.

238
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,930
And today there are so many: they speak the
same language, they talk the same language

239
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:29,080
and they understand it, what it is, because
now they are exposed to the new laws of divinity.

240
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,080
The Divine laws, the laws of God’s Kingdom,
they are very different from what we know.

241
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:42,520
Unless and until you evolve into that new
state, you cannot understand God.

242
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,880
You have to know yourself to know the God.

243
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,960
It’s like the eyes that have to open to
see the colour.

244
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:59,670
In the same way your Spirit has to come into
your conscious mind so that you know God in

245
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:07,220
your conscious mind.

246
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,330
I would like you people to ask me some questions,
the new people who have come and old people.

247
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,570
If there are some questions I would like to
answer.

248
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,540
But you see it’s such a big subject and
every time I have to go with the introduction.

249
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,830
I thought somebody must have given you introduction
to you, but doesn’t matter there’s book

250
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,179
which you can read and find out yourself.

251
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:35,500
But it’s best to know, is to have it.

252
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,300
Seeker: (inaudible)

253
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:48,270
Shri Mataji: What can one do?

254
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,549
Good idea.

255
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:52,549
You got Realisation last time.

256
00:23:52,549 --> 00:24:04,100
The problem is, it’s a collective happening.

257
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,910
Many people have to get Realisation and it’s
not individualistic.

258
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:18,160
We are all part and parcel of the whole, so
if one finger is enlightened, that finger

259
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,280
should try to enlighten another finger.

260
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:31,780
That is the best way, best way because once
this finger tries that it gets its power more.

261
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,070
Why should God give power to anyone who just
wants to keep it to himself?

262
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,750
The power increases as you start giving it
to others.

263
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:48,750
Like when you open one door no air will come
in, but if you open the other door the circulation

264
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,750
starts.

265
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,350
In the same way when you start giving it to
others – start raising the Kundalini; right

266
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,130
now you can start.

267
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:04,450
Just don’t be afraid, you can do it – you
will find immediately inside you will be coming

268
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,450
up.

269
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,600
Those who try to be exclusive and try to be
something great by doing everything at home

270
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
and, “Especially for myself!”

271
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,450
They are nowhere.

272
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,260
I find such people have horrible drawbacks.

273
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:27,170
Mix up with the other people: share it, share
it all the time and give Realisation to others.

274
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,700
Those who have given Realisation to others
have come up very much.

275
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,220
Those who think of others being realised,
come up much faster than the people who sit

276
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,730
at home and meditate for five hours.

277
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,309
There’s no need to meditate like that.

278
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,470
At the most just to cleanse yourself you can
spend about ten, fifteen minutes.

279
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:50,910
But there are many people whose attention
is only on themselves: “I must cleanse,

280
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:59,429
I must cleanse I must do this,” such people
do not get very far in Sahaj Yog.

281
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:05,190
Those people who try to do it for others,
talk to other people, work out much better.

282
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,570
I would say Australians have done much better
than English have done.

283
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,650
Maybe because of their temperaments, maybe.

284
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,000
And they are not such closed people you see.

285
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:23,090
For example they have their friends and there’s
no taboo on discussing religion with friends

286
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,090
as it is in England.

287
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,210
I think in England nobody discusses religion.

288
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,700
They’ll discuss the pubs and all nonsense
and all filth, but not the religion.

289
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,280
They are not supposed to: in etiquettes it
is prohibited I think.

290
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,760
So naturally this taboo leads you nowhere,
because you can’t talk of Sahaj Yoga to

291
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,250
your friends, who are there.

292
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:54,340
If they come to your house, you can ask them
what are the new wines in the market or, something,

293
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,059
such an ‘important’ thing they will talk
about.

294
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,760
But you can’t talk about religion or your
experiences of Sahaj Yoga that’s the problem

295
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,170
– it’s regarded as bad manners.

296
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:12,980
Now the question is that, these things are
to be shared and that’s why the Sahaj Yoga

297
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,700
you can only talk among Sahaj Yogis so it
[only] circulates among Sahaj Yogis.

298
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,040
Nobody wants to hear about it.

299
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,789
Even if you try to tell them they’ll say,”Oh
don’t tell us that we are not interested!”

300
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:27,090
It’s a very funny thing.

301
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:33,560
The other day I met a gentleman who had divorced
his wife, and she got her Realisation somewhere

302
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,270
and he got Realisation somewhere and both
of them met in a group.

303
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,900
She said, “How are you here?”

304
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,290
He said, “How are you here?”

305
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,150
She said, “We both got Realisation."

306
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,140
She said, “But you never told me about this!”

307
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,090
He said, “I didn’t want to discuss religion."

308
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,830
So she said, “I also got Realisation I didn’t
want to discuss religion."

309
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,780
Ultimately they discussed their divorce and
had a divorce, you see!

310
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,100
And if they had just told them that both of
them are realised and they would have never

311
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,760
divorced, because he thought this lady is
not a seeker so he divorced her, and she thought

312
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
he was not.

313
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,100
Even if they had felt each other’s vibrations
they would have been all right to know.

314
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,170
But she got her Realisation in another place
and he got Realisation in another place, and

315
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,419
they never knew that both are realised people
on the same plane.

316
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:22,760
He thought she was very materialistic and
she thought that he was very materialistic.

317
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,309
And then there was misunderstanding about
it.

318
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:29,240
And they are not to discuss, one should not
say these things.

319
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,130
Naturally everything ended up in a divorce
and now they want to marry again!

320
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:39,450
This is the one of the reasons why, in this
country, I think Sahaj Yoga doesn’t work

321
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,630
out because you are not supposed to tell anyone.

322
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,950
At the most you may tell it to your children,
maybe, I don’t know, to your mother, father

323
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:49,950
sometimes.

324
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,470
And all such people who have tried have been
able to bring their relations here.

325
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,690
But it’s only relations, not in friends.

326
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,010
With friends you are not supposed to say anything.

327
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,590
It’s a funny thing, isn’t it?

328
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,030
This is the society!

329
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,030
What to do now?

330
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:15,039
I hope gradually it will change, when people
will know about these things.

331
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:24,240
And in Australia what they do is to have programmes
for seven days.

332
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,710
It is very interesting I have got this from
there.

333
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,710
In the ashram they have seven days programme
and out of this one day they have a public

334
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,710
programme.

335
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,630
On this day every Sahaj Yogi is supposed to
bring four more.

336
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,700
He’s not allowed to come unless and until
brings four more that day.

337
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,870
And you have to bring four more you cannot
just come to Mothers programme and they can’t

338
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,750
listen to my tapes or anything unless and
until they bring four more.

339
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,890
But it is possible in Australia because I
found the people much more open you see and

340
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,610
they are.

341
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,620
I mean here, because of the climate may be
or we are frightened of others whatever it

342
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,130
is, there are certain taboos.

343
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,270
Like etiquettes, I think they don’t believe
much in etiquettes perhaps.

344
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,390
Like here there was an announcement that:
now you need not to do courtesy because of

345
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,040
tight clothes so you can just bow.

346
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,150
Something like that may turn up now that you
can discuss about seeking, if not about religion,

347
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,370
I hope so.

348
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,929
And this may be one of the reason people just
can’t talk about it.

349
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:32,210
But still whomsoever, whom you know, you should
try to tell them that: “I have an experience.

350
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,720
I met such and such person and this and that."

351
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,620
Immediately you will surprised your vibrations
will go up.

352
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:51,120
It is like this, that bigger the room, the
bigger is the light provided for.

353
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,270
If it is a smaller room then we don’t put
a big light, isn’t it?

354
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,140
In the same way if you have a wider thing.

355
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:07,580
There’s a one gentleman in India I told
you that he gave Realisation to ten thousand

356
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
people.

357
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:17,419
I must say that in Cambridge, Hillary and
Jim and Dawn have given Realisation to so

358
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:19,690
many people, so many people.

359
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:27,190
It’s interesting because there are Chilean
people, and the Chileans don’t believe in

360
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,460
such etiquettes so it has worked with them.

361
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,110
Maybe one day this may work out here when
we’ll talk to others.

362
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:44,059
So this is the only way you can really grow.

363
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:46,789
Seeker: (Inaudible)

364
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:58,130
Shri Mataji: Oh of course it is very important.

365
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,742
No that’s true you have to cleanse yourself
also.

366
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:03,340
There’s a way and method.

367
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,670
I must circulate that, it’s a beautiful
thing they have written down these Australian:

368
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,909
how they cleanse themselves, how they clear
out there chakras.

369
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:12,470
That is very important.

370
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:18,220
Of course you have to clean, [but] say supposing
you clean your car every day and you don’t

371
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,220
move out.

372
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,140
After sometime it will become a junk.

373
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,370
It’s like that.

374
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:28,340
You are cleaning yourself for what?

375
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,750
What is the purpose?

376
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:36,780
Every day we are cleaning, say the house and
everything and not even a rat comes in then

377
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,380
what’s the use of such a house?

378
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:50,920
If we clean all the lamps it should give light
otherwise what’s the use of cleaning?

379
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,960
It must have a purpose.

380
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,490
You must have a purpose.

381
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:59,400
Otherwise some people are just meditating,
meditating for what, I just don’t understand,

382
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,730
why are they meditating?

383
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,730
For what?

384
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,140
In all these gurus, they just say, “Oh you
go home and meditate."

385
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
But do what?

386
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,990
“Next time bring all the money to me and
again you go home and meditate."

387
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,320
Then if money is finished, “Now sell your
house bring all the money to me and meditate."

388
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,700
Then that is done then, “Sell your car,
sell everything, you stand on the streets

389
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,710
and meditate."

390
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,440
This is not the way!

391
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
(Laughing)

392
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,280
It has become a sort of a pass time for people
instead of going to pubs, maybe it is expensive,

393
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
better meditate.

394
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,090
It’s something like that you know.

395
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,570
It has no meaning to this meditation.

396
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,010
Meditation is that you have to be in meditation
when you see that these centres are in problem,

397
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:50,320
you cleanse them understandingly, purify them
and then use it for a purpose of giving it

398
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,929
to others.

399
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:58,320
And once you start doing it, it works better,
your instrument works much, much better.

400
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,789
It’s a dual way of doing things.

401
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:00,789
All right?

402
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:09,260
Seeker: Can the realised people recognise
other people who are realised?

403
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:26,819
Shri Mataji: Of course, minimum of minimum.

404
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:29,210
Same Seeker: (Inaudible)

405
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,399
Shri Mataji: No I wouldn’t say that.

406
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,309
You see, Realisation is that, first it’s
a linear movement of the Kundalini, so it

407
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:43,980
depends on what chakras are catching.

408
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,020
Supposing somebody has a Nabhi problem.

409
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,800
So you can’t say it’s a different stage
but he has a Nabhi problem, a particular problem.

410
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,139
Somebody has some other problem, like that.

411
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:01,539
But the other stage comes in when we would
say that once the first stage is called as

412
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:06,150
Nirvichar Samadhi that you achieve even before
Realisation, I mean you achieve but you do

413
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,499
not retain it.

414
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:13,430
When the Kundalini crosses over this centre
(of Agnya) then this Nirvichar Samadhi -means

415
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,130
thoughtless awareness – settles in.

416
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,890
But with this you can cure people but cannot
raise Kundalini.

417
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,670
But when it pierces through then you can raise
the Kundalini of other people.

418
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:29,640
But when it is settled down nicely, and when
you are absolutely without any doubts, it’s

419
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,500
a state, it’s a state of mind that comes
into you where you are absolutely doubtlessly

420
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,319
aware.

421
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:44,619
When that happens then only we expose you
to new experiences, before that we do not.

422
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:52,799
That’s a thing we have a little, we should
say, a little group of people where you have

423
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:56,000
to go up to Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

424
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,349
Unless and until you go to that stage you
cannot be exposed to new experiences because

425
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:05,269
you may shun it.

426
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:09,200
Because the truth can be quite difficult for
you.

427
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,969
So that’s the second stage we can say, where
you are exposed to those new experiences.

428
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:22,410
But first stage is to become thoughtlessly
aware with the vibrations.

429
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,170
But you can give Realisation to others, you
can give.

430
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:30,930
But Nirvikalpa is a different thing that:
whatever may happen you know that this is

431
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,450
the truth, whatever may happen.

432
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,539
That stage is to be achieved.

433
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:36,890
It’s a stage.

434
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:44,390
It’s a very high stage I would say where
you are so sensitive to things that immediately

435
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:50,450
you know what is negativity, from where it
is coming, how the attack is coming, how others

436
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,480
are affected.

437
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,349
We have a quite a lot of them among here also
people and then you are exposed to new experiences

438
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:02,529
better, and then you rise in there – that’s
the Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

439
00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:08,589
Then the complete Self-realisation comes in,
in a person, where he’s not bothered about

440
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:19,469
catching from anyone or getting any catches
or anything and he goes on with a very confident

441
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,200
attitude towards Sahaj Yoga.

442
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,200
I mean he is not bothered whether, “I am
catching or something is happening.

443
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,289
I will not see that person."

444
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:29,809
That sort of stage.

445
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:35,049
And we have some people on that stage who
are, I can say, self-realised fully.

446
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:38,180
They can control even elements.

447
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,059
There are people, we have got such people.

448
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,219
Beyond that is the stage of God’s-realisation.

449
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,309
That’s again in three stages works out.

450
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:53,710
But just now let’s start from the very beginning
and it will work out I am sure now.

451
00:37:53,710 --> 00:38:03,009
Now I’ve been working here for seven years
and actually some of these people who are

452
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:09,060
at Nirvikalpa have not been here even for
a year.

453
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,059
So it can work very fast.

454
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:18,029
As the people grow in number, these stages
also grow in maturity very fast.

455
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:23,140
You mature much faster as the people are more.

456
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,019
When there were few people you should know
that I had six people I was struggling with

457
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:31,680
them for four years in England.

458
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:39,079
Even in India the first disciples who got
Realisation were with me for two years continuously

459
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,250
and then they got Realisation, the first twelve.

460
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,410
It’s like that.

461
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:54,390
Now you know, everybody, all of you, are giving
Realisation.

462
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,319
Seeker: (Unclear)

463
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:02,109
Shri Mataji: Oh dynamic, absolutely dynamic.

464
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:05,880
Efficiency is too simple a word.

465
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,390
You just become dynamic.

466
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,849
Because a dynamic starts flowing through.

467
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,450
You don’t know how things work out.

468
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,869
It’s amazing!

469
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:20,119
It’s amazing how things work out.

470
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:32,269
Then all the forces which are dynamic, Divine
start their play in every way, material way

471
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,940
also, I must say.

472
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,719
Like London Sahaj Yogis wanted to have some
houses.

473
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,479
They said, “All right."

474
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:47,420
Now they have so many houses they don’t
know what to do them!

475
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:55,589
(Laughter) This is the condition: they don’t
know what to do, from where to get people

476
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:56,589
to house them.

477
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,310
This is the condition.

478
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:04,359
While nobody can get a house like that for
one year absolutely free or two years absolutely

479
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,880
free, a house that is just to be painted or
something.

480
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,880
And many houses like that.

481
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,420
They are getting one after so many houses
[that] they don’t know what to do with that!

482
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,569
I mean, a person will have to live in three
houses if we have to divide them!

483
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:19,569
(Laughter)

484
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:28,329
And a lady came to me she said I am told that
houses are only given to Sahaj Yogis so I

485
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:29,579
want to join Sahaj Yoga.

486
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,150
I said, “Very good idea!

487
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,160
But first you must get your Realisation, otherwise
the Sahaj Yogis won’t have you anywhere

488
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
near.

489
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,779
They don’t want people with bad vibrations.

490
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:43,619
So you have to get your Realisation."

491
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:50,369
I mean, it’s just a one of the small instances
but there are a thousand and one because it

492
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:51,369
becomes dynamic.

493
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:52,579
Your desire get enlightened.

494
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:59,809
First of all your desires become sensible,
you have wise desires and they get enlightened:

495
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:03,240
means you desire and you get it.

496
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,089
You are amazed!

497
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:06,930
Lady Seeker: (Unclear)

498
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:11,180
Shri Mataji: It is fantastic!

499
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,150
Can you stand up please?

500
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,709
I can’t hear you.

501
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:20,709
You please stand up here.

502
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:21,809
Australian Seeker: It’s described how the
Holy Spirit came on the Apostles in the Acts

503
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:32,140
of The Apostles, is that the same thing that
you are talking about?

504
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,099
Shri Mataji: I don’t think that was Holy
Ghost.

505
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:43,729
These apostles were also, the less said the
better!

506
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:47,589
You will know about them.

507
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:54,569
They were not realised, they never believed
in Christ till He got His resurrection which

508
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:59,160
they saw with their eyes they never believed
in Him.

509
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,239
You will know more about them.

510
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:06,369
I don’t want to go into any controversies
but that’s not the way.

511
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:08,140
You see, there are many people you have seen
now.

512
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,739
The other day I saw in BBC a man who is painting
like Van Gogh.

513
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:16,319
And he can say that, “I have got Holy Ghost
on me!”

514
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,539
That’s not the way, it’s a [dead] spirit.

515
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,440
Why God should make him paint like him?

516
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:30,859
If God has to give you something, He has to
give you something that you cannot do.

517
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:37,109
If you start speaking many languages, may
be so many dead spirits must have entered

518
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:38,109
into people.

519
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:40,279
There are many people who do that way.

520
00:42:40,279 --> 00:42:44,140
They just start talking so many languages,
there are spirits in them.

521
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,509
What is there to speak many languages?

522
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:46,569
What is so great?

523
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:50,950
We have in India one gentleman who can speak
twenty-eight languages, so what?

524
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,229
He’s not a realised-soul by any chance.

525
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:56,780
But how to talk [to them]?

526
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:03,329
They were just ordinary fishermen and they
would not listen.

527
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:06,979
You see, they were thinking they were obliging
Christ.

528
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:11,859
Every day there were list of relations who
were sick, who were brought to Christ, and

529
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:27,609
[it was] a big problem you know, a very tragic
thing, horrible.

530
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:34,240
People are much wiser now.

531
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,670
It’s very different now.

532
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:46,299
How could you talk to these people about Kundalini,
could you?

533
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:50,609
This is what happened with everyone who came
on this Earth.

534
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:52,579
Even Mohammad Sahib.

535
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,670
They know how to butcher.

536
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:00,109
You see, these people are not seekers and
they came to Christ.

537
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:02,230
They were not seekers.

538
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:05,890
If they were…I must say John was the best
among [them].

539
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,339
Even Mathew, he argued so much about the Immaculate
Conception.

540
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:14,420
You see, you don’t know what was all that.

541
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,420
Forget it!

542
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,789
You’ll know about them later on.

543
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,039
It is better you see now, to yourself.

544
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:21,519
Now I am before you, all right, forget about
them.

545
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:23,279
Let’s have it out.

546
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:25,910
It’s not that same thing.

547
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:30,050
You won’t be speaking many languages I can
assure you!

548
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,050
(Laughing)

549
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:37,259
But cold wind is the thing, that’s the thing.

550
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:40,900
That’s very true.

551
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:51,359
We had one experience of that: one gentleman
who was doing black magic, when, you say,

552
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,069
he was ‘archbishop’ of black magic, he
came to Sahaj Yoga and he got his Realisation

553
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,099
he got the cold wind.

554
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:06,309
And after that all the cups and saucers in
his house started flying around and everything

555
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:07,309
happening.

556
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:12,700
I mean it has happen very recently, about
I think fifteen, twenty days back.

557
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:18,380
And at about twelve o’clock in the night,
people from Brighton rang me at twelve o’clock

558
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,589
in the night, “Mother horrible things happening!”

559
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:22,070
I said, “What happened?”

560
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:27,209
“We gave Realisation to one man and the
whole house is in a whirlwind!

561
00:45:27,209 --> 00:45:31,460
Everything is moving around and we don’t
know what to do and everything cracking!”

562
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,089
“Oh God!”

563
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:36,670
I said, “who is this gentleman whom you
gave Realisation?”

564
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:41,019
He said, “He is very great in black magic
this and that."

565
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:45,000
I said, “Why did you give him Realisation?”

566
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,650
It’s a thing you know, they try to tempt,
because these spirits were around and they

567
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,650
wanted to tempt him.

568
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,680
They want to frighten also.

569
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,990
Because he has been so much with them, they
don’t want to give them up.

570
00:45:58,990 --> 00:45:59,990
And these things happen.

571
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,509
But that’s not the thing that we should
expect.

572
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:08,289
There was a lady whom I gave Realisation.

573
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:14,740
I told her that, “Because you are been indulging
into nonsensical things, your guru was a very

574
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,979
big tantrik and he used to do all such tricks,
you may start doing that after Realisation

575
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:21,519
also."

576
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,789
So she said, “No, no, no, Mother I don’t
want all that, I want param, I want the reality,

577
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:26,789
I don’t want that."

578
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:29,390
I said, “But still it will happen.

579
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,249
Somebody may try to tempt you so.

580
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:34,829
Because they do not want you to be realised."

581
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:37,869
And it happened to her!

582
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:43,700
Rice started falling from her hand, and then
she took another turn.

583
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,630
Ultimately she became a mad woman.

584
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,380
So it is so.

585
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:57,599
It can happen, but rarely, not so much if
you have not been a professional black magician

586
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:05,880
or something, it will not happen.

587
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:13,249
We have misunderstood many things and that’s
why it is necessary to know it and then understand.

588
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:18,709
Because if I tell you something there would
be blockade and barrier in your mind.

589
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:22,700
As it is people are brainwashed by so many
things.

590
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,619
Like those who are Muslims don’t want to
look at Christ, they don’t want to hear.

591
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:29,470
Those who are Christians don’t want to hear
about anybody else.

592
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:33,789
Those who are Hindus, they don’t want to
know about anybody else.

593
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:38,119
But Sahaj Yoga gives meaning to all of them.

594
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,209
All them, are important.

595
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:43,369
All of them.

596
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:49,430
Every one is important for Sahaj Yoga and
they reside within us in those different chakras.

597
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,869
It’s a very different thing.

598
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,609
One has to first see and then judge.

599
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:58,539
Not to judge about anything without seeing
it.

600
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:05,479
But without seeing, whatever we judge may
not be correct.

601
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:06,940
All right?

602
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,220
Should we have the vibrations now?

603
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,289
Let’s.

604
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:16,720
Please put your hand like this.

605
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,849
Just be relaxed.

606
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:24,210
You have to ask for your Realisation, otherwise
it doesn’t work out, I must tell you.

607
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:28,999
Douglas [Fry] please open these windows.

608
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:33,099
There should be some cross-ventilation I think.

609
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:37,959
Let it be, that’s sufficient.

610
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:40,880
It’s all right.

611
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,660
It’s like a little brahmarandhra hole blowing
some [air].

612
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,279
Put your hands like this and close your eyes

613
00:48:51,279 --> 00:49:00,900
Please keep the eyes closed, don’t keep
them open, because the Kundalini won’t rise

614
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,029
above the Agnya if you keep your eyes open.

615
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:04,029
Please keep them closed.
