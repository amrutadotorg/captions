00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:17.652
Today, we are going to do Puja to Shiva,
Shri Shiva.

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:30.748
As you know Shri Shiva is the reflection
of Sadashiva within us.

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.418
I have already told about the reflection.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:40.990
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:50.619
the One who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.816
But He is the Father

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:07.620
who is watching each one of His Creation
or Her Creation.

00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:21.507
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely,
fully strengthening.

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:32.178
There’s no doubt in His mind about
the capability of the Adi Shakti.

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:41.395
But when He finds that, in the play
of Adi Shakti,

00:01:43.211 --> 00:01:52.623
the people of the world as such, try
to disturb Her,

00:01:52.824 --> 00:02:01.628
or spoil Her work then He gets
into His wrathful mood

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:11.982
and He destroys all such people and maybe
He destroys the whole world.

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:20.157
On one side He is wrathful no doubt,

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:27.673
on the other side He's the ocean
of compassion and joy.

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:33.734
That's why when He's reflected within us

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:41.126
we get our Self-realization. We get
the light of our spirit

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:48.687
and we get into the ocean of joy.

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:54.281
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

00:02:54.482 --> 00:03:02.422
So, those who get self-realized get
the knowledge of the Divine,

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:13.663
which is very subtle, permeating into every
atom and molecule,

00:03:14.314 --> 00:03:20.903
the power of this knowledge is there.

00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:26.915
Now we should know what is this
Realization we have got.

00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:30.697
What does that mean and what is
the culminating point.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.066
Now the first step is to become
thoughtlessly aware,

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:43.047
where you cross your mind. You go above
your mind.

00:03:43.248 --> 00:03:49.106
Mind cannot affect you. This is the first
stage as we call is thoughtless awareness.

00:03:49.307 --> 00:03:55.718
Second one is where, you see, start seeing
the working of this Paramachaitanya,

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.990
of this all-pervading Power and you start
becoming aware

00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:08.945
that there is lot of truth in what Mataji
says.

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:14.161
That there is this power, which works out
many things.

00:04:14.362 --> 00:04:18.020
It works miraculously so many things
for you.

00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:25.535
It gives you blessings, it guides you,
it helps you, in so many ways it helps you.

00:04:25.736 --> 00:04:32.355
It gives you good health, good wealth and
also a very good society

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:36.836
of very beautiful people in the collective.

00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:40.556
All that you can see clearly is happening
here.

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:46.937
Now this main question today, which
I'm going to tell you about

00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:52.933
that what is God's realization. First is
the Self-realization

00:04:53.134 --> 00:04:57.982
and there are many ambitious people who
want to become God's-realized.

00:04:58.183 --> 00:05:03.755
First and foremost thing we should know
that human beings cannot become God.

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:06.760
It's not the becoming of it.

00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:13.250
You have not become also in a way spirit
because the spirit is emitting through you,

00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:18.138
using you, giving you, looking after you.

00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:24.809
If you become the spirit there won't be
any body left, nothing will be left.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.809
So with this body intact, your spirit
is acting through this body,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.545
is giving you all the light.

00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:39.757
But one cannot become God Almighty; this
one has to understand very clearly.

00:05:39.958 --> 00:05:45.319
But what is God's realization is to know
about God.

00:05:46.874 --> 00:05:56.210
You see, to know about God means to know
how His powers are working.

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:05.511
How He controls by becoming part and parcel
of God Almighty.

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:14.004
Like My finger doesn't know about My brain,
but it acts according to My brain.

00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:17.655
The finger cannot become the brain,

00:06:17.856 --> 00:06:23.136
but it has to act absolutely according
to My brain

00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:27.558
because it is so connected, it is so one.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:34.121
Here when you have the God's realization
then you know about the brain,

00:06:34.322 --> 00:06:41.947
you know about God, you know about His
powers, you know everything about Him.

00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:48.684
As far as I'm concerned it's a difficult
task for you, because I'm a Mahamaya.

00:06:48.885 --> 00:06:52.594
It's very difficult for you to know each
and everything about Me.

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:57.836
I'm quite a elusive person as you know that
well,

00:06:58.037 --> 00:07:06.038
and whatever I do or whatever I achieve,
it is just for you to see and understand

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:11.800
that after all this is Adi Shakti and She
can do all these things.

00:07:12.001 --> 00:07:16.538
You can also do all the things but you
cannot become Me.

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:25.900
But you have to know, to know through
love, through devotion, through prayers

00:07:26.101 --> 00:07:31.821
to know the God's Powers is the way you are
God-realized.

00:07:32.022 --> 00:07:37.029
Then you can control the nature, you can
control everything,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.532
if you have that knowledge within you
about God.

00:07:41.733 --> 00:07:47.734
For that a complete humility is needed that
you cannot become God,

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:51.779
cannot become God Almighty. You cannot
become the deities

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.376
but definitely you can become God-realized.
Means God acts through you,

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:04.834
uses you as His power, as His channel and
that you know, that you know

00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:09.070
what He's doing to you, what He's telling,
what His vision is

00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:13.947
and what is the information. The connection
is like that.

00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:18.758
Many people in Sahaja Yoga have been
benefited, I know.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:23.132
But they don't know how they have been
benefited. What has worked it out?

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:27.991
How it has worked it out. What connection
of theirs has helped them?

00:08:28.192 --> 00:08:35.319
Once you do that, you know that, clearly
how things are working out,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.046
with what power you have achieved it, then
it's a God's realization.

00:08:42.247 --> 00:08:47.308
Such people become extremely powerful
in the sense

00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:52.504
that they can control so many things.

00:08:54.948 --> 00:08:58.004
There have been many saints of that kind

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:04.451
but sometimes they fell from even that and
they developed their ego.

00:09:04.652 --> 00:09:07.919
They didn't have their own humility that
they should have,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.452
that devotion, that dedication, that
surrendering.

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:19.673
They fell down and you see them, I've seen
some of them that they become

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:25.378
quite proud of their achievements and they
don't want to give it to anyone.

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:28.034
They think they have achieved it with great difficulties

00:09:28.227 --> 00:09:35.016
and why should they give it to others. Such
people are not going to rise very higher.

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:40.360
But you people who have got your realization
and who are humble,

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:49.204
who know that out of humility only you are
going to achieve your surrendering.

00:09:49.405 --> 00:09:54.536
Islam means surrender. Mohammed Sahib has
talked about Islam,

00:09:54.737 --> 00:10:00.303
meaning, "you surrender." If you cannot
surrender you can never know God.

00:10:00.504 --> 00:10:04.105
Is clearly said that, "Unless and until you
know yourself

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:07.523
you will not know about God."

00:10:07.724 --> 00:10:14.013
So as Sahajis you have to know all
the little, little things,

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:18.643
all the big things, and all the great
visions,

00:10:18.844 --> 00:10:26.457
that you can do it because of the grace
of God, because His blessings,

00:10:26.658 --> 00:10:33.916
because of His love for you, that you have
entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:10:34.117 --> 00:10:40.104
I may say you have entered, I may say you
have achieved that state,

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:46.906
I may say that. But still you are not
there.

00:10:47.107 --> 00:10:52.086
It's like if I tell somebody, "Now you are
in Australia."

00:10:52.287 --> 00:10:55.546
He's not in Australia, but I can say you
are in Australia.

00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:58.310
So he believes, "I am in Australia", that's
not the way.

00:10:58.511 --> 00:11:03.434
You have to be in Australia, then you have
to know about Australia.

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:08.551
You have to know what sort of climate
it is, what sort of things it is.

00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:14.267
One flight is up to the thoughtless
awareness.

00:11:14.468 --> 00:11:19.667
The second one is up to the doubtless
awareness

00:11:19.868 --> 00:11:23.949
and the third one is to God's realization.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.449
I've seen people who are very close to Me
also don't understand.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.864
They behave in such a manner as if now
they've become gods.

00:11:34.065 --> 00:11:40.880
So egoistical they are that I am amazed at
them. Then they have to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:41.058 --> 00:11:48.553
So you see, even if I praise you too much,
if I say anything too much,

00:11:48.754 --> 00:11:53.585
you shouldn't get pampered. It's a testing
ground.

00:11:53.786 --> 00:11:59.331
Or otherwise also if I tell you that,

00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:04.857
"This is not good, you should improve
on this", you shouldn't mind,

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:11.999
because I have to do it, that's My job.
And your job is to listen to Me.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.369
Because I have nothing to gain from you.
I do not ask for anything.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:23.326
What I want is you all should get all My
powers. You may not become what I am,

00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:28.544
agreed, but please try to get all
the powers that I have.

00:12:28.745 --> 00:12:31.604
Which is not a difficult thing.

00:12:31.805 --> 00:12:39.331
This is what is God's realization. That's
what is to know Shiva and Sadashiva.

00:12:39.532 --> 00:12:43.412
Through the Shiva you know Sadashiva.
You see the reflection

00:12:43.613 --> 00:12:50.685
and from reflection you know who is
the original.

00:12:50.886 --> 00:12:57.930
From the reflection you learn. Thus you
reach that state where you think

00:12:58.131 --> 00:13:02.643
you are now definitely settled
in the Kingdom of God

00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:09.418
and that you can see God, you can feel God,

00:13:09.619 --> 00:13:12.916
you can understand God.

00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:18.120
And you can love God.

00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:20.571
So may God bless you.
