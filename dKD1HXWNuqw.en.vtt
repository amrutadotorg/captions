00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.795
So it’s very nice to arrive here among all of you and

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:45.032
I’m sorry for what has happened before My coming here.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:50.554
But, as I also told you that nature also

00:00:50.937 --> 00:00:55.964
can be awakened with the presence of a Divine personality,

00:00:56.085 --> 00:01:00.226
and once it is awakened it starts behaving in a manner,

00:01:00.347 --> 00:01:02.623
as a realized soul would do.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:13.261
Like it gets angry with people who are not religious,

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:16.519
people who don’t want to know about God,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.375
people who are doing wrong things on life,

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.844
people who are not normal people,

00:01:22.965 --> 00:01:27.742
in the sense they don’t want to be part and parcel of the whole,

00:01:27.863 --> 00:01:30.409
recluses, all sorts of people.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.930
And once it is brought to that level then it starts working on its own.

00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.468
As you know that according to Sahaja Yoga

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:44.879
all these elements have got a deity behind it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.383
For example, agni has got a deity called Agni Devata.

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:55.141
In pure form Agni Devata is the one, which really purifies us.

00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:58.906
It purifies everything, it purifies say a gold,

00:01:59.027 --> 00:02:02.023
if you put gold in the fire it doesn’t burn,

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:05.110
it comes out more brilliant, better.

00:02:05.277 --> 00:02:10.679
But if it is something that is not of such a value it will burn off.

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.818
So all inflammable things are mostly

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.563
of a low-grade things, which are to be burned only.

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:22.447
But amazingly these lower things only

00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:25.902
when they are enlightened or you can say,

00:02:26.023 --> 00:02:31.584
when you put some wood, you take and you put fire to it,

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.940
so when fire is added to that wood

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.333
the same fire which is coming, actually the base is that wood itself,

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:46.444
it is inflammable, and the flames that are coming out of that fire,

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:49.633
once they are enlightened

00:02:49.754 --> 00:02:55.110
they start knowing what is truth, what is untruth.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.160
Or reacting in such a manner as if they know it, what work has to be done.

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.554
Now the difference between a Sahaja Yogi and the fire,

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:11.837
which is so initiated, is this, that it does not think about it.

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:17.226
It just goes on completely finishing things, which it has to do.

00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:23.030
And by a method of frequencies it knows where to go and which one to burn off.

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:28.140
And that’s how it goes on burning things, which it has to burn.

00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:32.683
And some of the unfortunate things are

00:03:32.804 --> 00:03:37.679
that people feel that this fire has no compassion

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.007
and that the fire must have some compassion also to spare some people.

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:48.674
But the trouble is we must understand that we have so many things within us.

00:03:48.815 --> 00:03:52.490
We’ve got fire, we’ve got water, we’ve got Mother Earth

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:54.299
all elements are within us.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.660
But in the fire – it is only the fire element, nothing else.

00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:03.221
So it acts according to its own quality, that is fire.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.729
And whatever is the quality of the fire when enlightened,

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.380
separates truth from untruth

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.880
and starts behaving in that manner, but it remains fire.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.246
It cannot become compassion.

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:20.504
But in a way if you see, when you start choosing

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:24.308
between the wrong type of a person and a right type of a person

00:04:24.429 --> 00:04:28.750
if you see in a subtle way it is compassion because it is truth,

00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:30.617
and truth is love.

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:35.261
So whatever it is doing is to manifest the love of God,

00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:38.265
and when it is manifesting the love of God

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:40.843
you should know, that though it is fire

00:04:40.964 --> 00:04:44.367
it gets the performance of a personality,

00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:48.164
which is as if, is a human being.

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.906
Because it is discreet.

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:55.843
It knows what to burn and what not to burn.

00:04:56.253 --> 00:05:02.972
One day I must tell you, we were doing some sort of a cleaning of the doors

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:08.375
with those lamps you get and Linda one day you see by mistake,

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:12.074
brought that lamp very close to My body

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:15.418
and the lamp, the flame was very strong,

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.070
but it just went round Me, didn’t touch Me.

00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:22.765
She was surprised, she said, ” Mother You’re burning."

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:25.828
I said, “Don’t worry,” it just went round and came out.

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.718
So the fire doesn’t burn a person who is pure, doesn’t burn.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.385
The example is Sitaji.

00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:42.725
Sitaji when She was brought by Shri Rama from Ravana’s place,

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:45.783
you see, everybody said that She has lived with a Rakasha

00:05:45.904 --> 00:05:51.807
and She must be found out whether She is guilty or not.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:56.967
So Rama first of all He said, “All right,” He put the fire.

00:05:57.088 --> 00:06:01.397
She Herself said that, “You put a fire, a big pyre of fire,”

00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:03.187
and She sat on that.

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:08.112
And when the fire started burning it could not burn Her,

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:12.429
She could not be burnt, you see, and the whole fire subsided.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.538
So that time the Agni Devata knows what is right, what is wrong.

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.028
Who is holy, who is unholy.

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:26.268
But human beings take lot of time to recognize that

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.503
and to understand, even in Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:32.571
because the sensitivity has to be grown much more.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:36.302
Now why is it, that anything that like water,

00:06:36.423 --> 00:06:39.768
or Agni or any one of these elements become

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:42.635
so sensitive than human beings are.

00:06:42.756 --> 00:06:46.155
How they just obediently do the thing,

00:06:46.276 --> 00:06:50.081
as if they know the job and they’re so quick at it, so efficient.

00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:54.948
The reason is they are completely under the control of the Divine.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:07:02.133
They are under the control of the powers of God, absolutely, hundred percent.

00:07:02.254 --> 00:07:06.904
Whatever God wants, they do it, once they are enlightened.

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:09.824
But human beings are still, you see,

00:07:09.945 --> 00:07:14.986
dwindling between his own human awareness and the Divine awareness

00:07:15.106 --> 00:07:16.918
and the oneness with God.

00:07:17.038 --> 00:07:21.548
So it is the sensitivity in a person grows very, very, slowly

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:24.052
– doesn’t matter makes no difference –

00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:27.699
and when it grows, it comes you see it moves sometimes,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.352
two steps forwards and five steps backwards, you see again like that.

00:07:31.473 --> 00:07:34.879
When the time is about two years, you’ll find a gentleman at the same spot

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.801
where he started.

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:40.875
You get quite upset at how it has happened, despite Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:44.152
But this is the thing is, that human beings can think,

00:07:44.273 --> 00:07:47.719
and they can decide, and they have ultimate freedom

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.984
to give up this sensitivity at any time.

00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:58.812
So you have to be under complete obedience of the Divine,

00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:01.469
which is, one cannot understand sometimes

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.551
how to be like that because we have not been brought up that way.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:08.245
We don’t know how to do it and it’s very difficult.

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:11.131
So many people say, “Mother it’s very difficult to surrender."

00:08:11.252 --> 00:08:13.685
It’s not that they don’t want to surrender, but they think

00:08:13.806 --> 00:08:16.776
that, “We are still you see, there is still ego popping up somewhere,

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.370
Mother says something but we start questioning her.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.747
Mother says this, then we think that we should,

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:27.752
we can suggest to Mother there’s another alternative and this and that."

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:31.505
But there’s no alternative, there’s no alternative

00:08:31.626 --> 00:08:34.274
for a person who’s a sensible person.

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:37.789
If he knows that Divine is only thinking of your hitha,

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:42.725
of your well-being, and whatever it sees and does, you see,

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:47.088
knows much more than you, much much more.

00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:50.627
And in so many dimensions that, if

00:08:50.748 --> 00:08:54.811
somebody says so that, “Do like this,” best is to do that.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:57.233
Sometimes it shocks people.

00:08:57.418 --> 00:09:00.099
People have ideas about sympathies,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.013
ideas about being, you see, kind to others,

00:09:04.134 --> 00:09:06.639
and compassionate to others.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.466
But what is a human compassion, it doesn’t do anything it just talks.

00:09:10.587 --> 00:09:13.980
While the God’s compassion works, it works.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.867
It works on people, it doesn’t talk that, “Oh, I’m very compassionate,

00:09:18.988 --> 00:09:23.473
I’m full of compassion,” nothing, it just works, it manifests itself.

00:09:23.594 --> 00:09:28.851
So one should understand to be a complete ego-less personality,

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:35.836
one should try to obey the Self within yourself.

00:09:35.957 --> 00:09:39.154
Now how do you obey yourself within yourself?

00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:41.884
It is through vibratory awareness.

00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:46.056
Try to obey through your vibratory awareness.

00:09:46.177 --> 00:09:49.322
Any question you want to ask, anything you want to do,

00:09:49.443 --> 00:09:54.096
you must obey it through your vibratory awareness.

00:09:54.217 --> 00:09:57.755
Now some people are not so sensitive, that’s true.

00:09:57.876 --> 00:10:01.831
The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it.

00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:05.283
Now you think with your brain, all right?

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:08.138
If your brain can be enlightened,

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:12.966
then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will improve,

00:10:13.087 --> 00:10:16.608
because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system.

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:19.478
Now in the central nervous system if there is any blockage

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.529
it is actually in the brain

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.533
because all the centers are represented in the brain.

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:28.029
So the best thing is to say that,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.166
“Mother come in my brain. Please reside in my brain.

00:10:33.287 --> 00:10:36.686
Please make Your room in this brain.

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:39.606
You be the controller of this brain.

00:10:39.727 --> 00:10:43.463
Let this brain be guided by Your divine wisdom."

00:10:43.584 --> 00:10:45.662
And you don’t think for yourself,

00:10:45.783 --> 00:10:49.470
and this word ‘I think’ should be dropped completely from Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:52.669
‘I think’ means, goes on you see, in funny ways;

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.895
it can be anything, you see.

00:10:55.016 --> 00:10:57.792
Like once we went out and we had

00:10:57.913 --> 00:11:03.441
one of my very stupid relations staying with us, a girl.

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:07.072
And as I was going out – we had no servants that day,

00:11:07.194 --> 00:11:10.647
so I was cooking – but that day when we were going out I said to her,

00:11:10.768 --> 00:11:14.436
“I’m going in the morning, so can you make a little bit of khichdi  for us

00:11:14.557 --> 00:11:17.068
and when we come back we’ll have it."

00:11:17.189 --> 00:11:21.143
That’s the only cooking she did in her lifetime, maybe she did not do also.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:26.554
So when we came back she told Me that she has not cooked.

00:11:26.674 --> 00:11:28.443
So I said, “Why? Why didn’t you cook,

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:31.009
because we were supposed to take our food here."

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:35.299
She said, “I thought that maybe you may not come.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.170
Maybe you’re not hungry, maybe you may not like to eat.

00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:41.071
Maybe I may not cook well,”

00:11:41.192 --> 00:11:44.266
you see, all these four alternatives not to do the cooking.

00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:49.307
But I said, “Why didn’t you think that we may be hungry, that we will eat.

00:11:49.428 --> 00:11:51.229
Why didn’t you think this way?”

00:11:51.353 --> 00:11:54.369
“But I thought,” you see this is an explanation

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:59.297
for not having one in the brain I should say,

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:04.348
that there is no Divine guidance in the brain.

00:12:04.469 --> 00:12:08.076
Then the guidance comes from your ego

00:12:08.197 --> 00:12:12.877
or from your superego, which says, “I thought that this might happen."

00:12:12.997 --> 00:12:15.694
But how, why, why did you think like that?

00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:17.736
Why not the other way round?

00:12:17.857 --> 00:12:19.854
Why didn’t you think the other way round?

00:12:19.975 --> 00:12:22.002
But that is how it is,

00:12:22.123 --> 00:12:26.057
and when these things happen we really are so much used to this

00:12:26.177 --> 00:12:30.881
kind of justification and alternatives to be offered,

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.778
that this becomes again the habit

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:38.491
of the brain and the brain gets separated from the Divine.

00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:41.987
So you tell your brain, “But why, why did you think like that?

00:12:42.107 --> 00:12:45.991
Now will you stop thinking about these things on these lines?

00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:48.546
Let us think of the positive thinking."

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:51.288
Now positive thinking is nothing but is a thinking

00:12:51.409 --> 00:12:54.201
– as according to Sahaja Yoga, is not aggressive thinking,

00:12:54.322 --> 00:13:03.359
but it means that a thinking which helps to manifest the Divine.

00:13:03.768 --> 00:13:05.846
That is what is positive thinking.

00:13:09.025 --> 00:13:13.962
And the result of that is that

00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:19.990
your nerves start opening out, and you start feeling

00:13:24.343 --> 00:13:30.937
the  manifestations of divine power in your fingers in your being.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.699
And this is the basic thing that doesn’t happen in the West

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.283
or in the Western culture because

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:43.538
we have a very big idea of always giving an explanation for anything.

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:46.331
Now you can see that, supposing

00:13:46.452 --> 00:13:51.417
you go to a person who is possessed and you get possessed,

00:13:51.538 --> 00:13:55.233
then you’ll give an explanation you see, I went to that person

00:13:55.354 --> 00:13:59.664
thinking, I thought, that I would cure that person.

00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:03.476
But the result is that you are mad now.

00:14:03.597 --> 00:14:07.000
Instead of that person getting cured, you get posessed.

00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:11.290
So what is the reason? The reason is that you thought in a very negative way,

00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:15.610
that, “I thought that this would help me

00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:20.986
or I was helping that person”. On the contrary you got into trouble.

00:14:21.106 --> 00:14:25.580
Now the trouble did not think,

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.393
no, it just entered into you without thinking.

00:14:29.514 --> 00:14:33.127
It is there, it never thought “whether I enter this person or not,”

00:14:33.248 --> 00:14:37.059
it just came in, walked straight forward. While you were busy thinking, you see,

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.239
it entered into your being and settled down there.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.926
So it’s like a thief

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:51.371
walking into your house nicely when you are busy,

00:14:51.492 --> 00:14:55.996
absentmindedly doing something, you see, it’s exactly like this.

00:14:56.117 --> 00:14:58.270
You see the thief walking in suddenly you find

00:14:58.391 --> 00:15:00.699
Oh, the thief is standing behind you

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.666
– now you said, “I was thinking."

00:15:08.604 --> 00:15:11.842
Is exactly the same way it happens to us

00:15:11.963 --> 00:15:16.608
and when we know, our mind knows, that “I can give an explanation about it."

00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:22.397
Every time it is ready to give explanation then the mind, you see,

00:15:22.518 --> 00:15:26.202
is used to that kind of a phenomenon,

00:15:26.323 --> 00:15:30.206
that it will always give an excuse, always it will say something.

00:15:30.327 --> 00:15:33.147
So it is never on the alert, because you see,

00:15:33.268 --> 00:15:36.670
even if the trouble walks into you, you’ll always say

00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:38.143
“this is the explanation."

00:15:38.264 --> 00:15:43.120
But explanation doesn’t cure, doesn’t help you.

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:46.213
Because by mental explanation...

00:15:46.591 --> 00:15:51.630
She’s not well, give her some soothing things.

00:15:58.798 --> 00:16:05.505
So one should not be extremely on the thought waves

00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:08.130
and on depending on their thinking

00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:11.083
because, you see, thinking has an alternative.

00:16:11.204 --> 00:16:14.153
Thinking always has an alternative.

00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:18.243
You can say, ” I was thinking this, or I was thinking that."

00:16:18.391 --> 00:16:19.781
But whom are you blaming?

00:16:19.902 --> 00:16:23.049
It was you who were thinking so you are responsible for that.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.969
So if you take the responsibility for your thinking,

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.727
then you may not do such a thing as to say that,

00:16:29.848 --> 00:16:34.337
“I thought, if I had done this thing it would have been better,”

00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:38.068
because you are responsible for your thinking.

00:16:38.188 --> 00:16:40.621
Supposing an engine driver decides that

00:16:40.742 --> 00:16:44.788
“I thought I better go by the other route,” and has a big accident.

00:16:44.908 --> 00:16:47.969
People will ask him, “Why did you think like that?

00:16:48.093 --> 00:16:50.867
What was the thing that made you think like that?”

00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:55.070
But in everyday to day life I find human beings are always saying,

00:16:55.191 --> 00:17:00.820
“I think, I think, I think,” all the time giving alternatives

00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:05.683
and that’s why they go up and down, up and down, up and down like that.

00:17:05.804 --> 00:17:11.726
But for fire, or for water, or for Mother Earth

00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:15.233
there is no alternative, no more alternative.

00:17:15.354 --> 00:17:18.901
If I just touch the Mother Earth and I say, “Suck in their problems please,”

00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:21.207
She just sucks them in.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.907
If I tell the fire, “Now come along you have been ignited."

00:17:25.027 --> 00:17:29.999
I don’t even tell, I don’t even tell, they immediately suck in.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.972
Their Kundalini rises you can say.

00:17:33.112 --> 00:17:38.823
You put a fire in front of My photograph it’s vibrated,

00:17:41.182 --> 00:17:46.104
you put a light it’s vibrated, it has no alternatives.

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.831
It doesn’t think it has no alternatives,

00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:53.766
it’s just enlightened, it has its own quality of enlightenment in the purest sense,

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:57.023
because thinking makes it impure.

00:17:57.143 --> 00:18:00.744
Your enlightenment becomes impure by your thinking,

00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:07.870
by giving explanations, by giving all these nonsensical alternatives.

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:11.945
So one should know with the Divine there is no alternative.

00:18:12.065 --> 00:18:14.268
In Sanskrit the word is paryaya,

00:18:14.389 --> 00:18:19.596
there is no paryaya for Divine instrument.

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:21.781
There’s nothing like that.

00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:24.320
Supposing you don’t want to accept it,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.623
you’ll have problems and then you’ll say that,

00:18:26.744 --> 00:18:28.581
“Mother how did we have problems?”

00:18:28.702 --> 00:18:32.854
As you saw in Delhi, I told these people many a times

00:18:32.987 --> 00:18:35.776
that, “Please do not have any program

00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:41.698
for eight days and let all these people stay with some friends."

00:18:42.198 --> 00:18:45.078
They wouldn’t listen to me.

00:18:45.198 --> 00:18:48.933
They’re in the program in that flat business

00:18:49.089 --> 00:18:53.347
and they were thinking they will have a big pendal

00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:56.581
in which they’ll give them the food to eat and all that.

00:18:56.722 --> 00:19:00.370
But you know what happened, it rained, and rained, and rained.

00:19:00.534 --> 00:19:03.616
Now rain knew what I wanted,

00:19:03.737 --> 00:19:06.461
because it had to rain for the rabbi crop, you see,

00:19:06.582 --> 00:19:09.594
I have to look after the whole universe.

00:19:09.714 --> 00:19:12.198
And that’s why I said, “That for these eight days

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.440
don’t allow them to stay in this

00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:16.955
because it will be difficult for them to move out,

00:19:17.077 --> 00:19:18.992
better keep them with some other people

00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:21.528
so they can carry them along and all that.

00:19:21.664 --> 00:19:23.583
But they did not, you see.

00:19:23.766 --> 00:19:26.016
Ultimately it turned out to be a fiasco.

00:19:26.137 --> 00:19:30.500
They had to arrange for the stay of all other people into some houses.

00:19:30.655 --> 00:19:33.782
So this is this situation. Now they might say

00:19:33.903 --> 00:19:36.813
that, “Mother, You better stop the rain."

00:19:36.934 --> 00:19:38.305
I will not.

00:19:38.426 --> 00:19:41.074
Because it is, they must know

00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:47.868
that the question of rabi crop is also equally important for Me

00:19:48.008 --> 00:19:50.789
and they have to have their share.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.141
After all they are human beings and they are to be helped.

00:19:54.262 --> 00:19:56.055
But why didn’t you listen to Me?

00:19:56.176 --> 00:19:58.168
And then he came to Me and he said that,

00:19:58.289 --> 00:20:00.490
“Mother will you please stop the rain tomorrow?”

00:20:00.611 --> 00:20:03.208
I said, “All right, tomorrow I will."

00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:06.781
Went back and he told the other gentleman, he said that,

00:20:06.902 --> 00:20:10.001
“Let’s put up the (inaudible), let’s put up pendal

00:20:10.121 --> 00:20:16.597
and let the, let us cook there." He said, “But no it will rain."

00:20:16.718 --> 00:20:21.460
He said, “No, it will not because I’ve told God Himself."

00:20:22.218 --> 00:20:23.796
He said, “Where did you meet God?”

00:20:23.917 --> 00:20:26.301
He said, “I did meet Her, and now it’s done."

00:20:26.421 --> 00:20:30.265
Next day was, he got up at five o’clock the other fellow

00:20:30.394 --> 00:20:32.597
and he saw the whole sky so clear and he said,

00:20:32.718 --> 00:20:35.710
“Look at that. You have told God and God has listened to you."

00:20:38.824 --> 00:20:42.938
So this is it, then when you are that much one with God,

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:46.108
I mean if you tell anything it will work out.

00:20:46.323 --> 00:20:48.254
Anything you ask for it will work out.

00:20:48.374 --> 00:20:52.671
But we are not, we are always finding alternatives, you see.

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:55.112
And these alternatives is a game,

00:20:55.233 --> 00:20:58.049
all these people have played with you,

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.373
all the time giving you alternatives.

00:21:00.494 --> 00:21:03.715
See now, in the market if you go,

00:21:03.836 --> 00:21:08.694
just now I asked him about how, what car you have.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:11.467
So he told me there are so many combinations,

00:21:11.588 --> 00:21:14.773
this that, cylinder this that, so you go mad.

00:21:14.894 --> 00:21:18.358
“All right Baba, give me something, whatever it is."

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:22.358
And then you see they, this is all playing with your brains

00:21:22.479 --> 00:21:26.608
all the time giving you alternatives, whether you want this or that.

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:31.669
And you feel that you are really a great personality that you can decide about

00:21:31.885 --> 00:21:35.864
“I’ll have this color and that thing,” very seriously people do it.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:40.383
Even I’ve seen, you see, in a dinner if people are sitting

00:21:40.504 --> 00:21:45.797
in a hotel or something, they’ll study all the menu very carefully

00:21:45.918 --> 00:21:48.824
and anyone of them will say, “All right I’ll have this,”

00:21:48.945 --> 00:21:51.058
the other fellow will say, “I’ll have that”

00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:53.763
And the bearer is quite puzzled but owners are happy

00:21:53.884 --> 00:21:55.920
that they have befooled you completely.

00:21:56.041 --> 00:22:00.136
They just mix up this with that, “Oh this is this, this is this,”

00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:04.569
and just they try to befool, you see. Everything is boiled, kept there, all right,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.383
this is the choice, this with masala,

00:22:07.504 --> 00:22:09.645
this with masala, it’s all ready.

00:22:09.766 --> 00:22:14.281
You see, just mix that, put it before you, “Oh I’ve got very good this thing…”

00:22:14.448 --> 00:22:18.237
It’s not, it’s not that your Spirit is happy with it,

00:22:18.358 --> 00:22:20.697
it’s not even your stomach that is happy with it,

00:22:20.818 --> 00:22:23.427
it’s not even your palate that is happy with it,

00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:26.287
it’s only your brain, this ego is happy.

00:22:26.408 --> 00:22:29.460
And you say. “Oh, very nice, oh."

00:22:32.202 --> 00:22:34.480
Still it’s not good.

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.381
Same thing with gurus it happens like that.

00:22:37.502 --> 00:22:39.611
That you see they pay for the guru, all right,

00:22:39.732 --> 00:22:42.362
so now the satisfaction is “I have paid for the guru."

00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:46.373
And when you go there, even they feel the scorpion

00:22:46.494 --> 00:22:49.084
is pinching them, you see, all the time is biting.

00:22:49.205 --> 00:22:50.540
You say, “What happened?”

00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:55.061
“No, no, it’s all right, nothing has gone wrong."

00:22:57.465 --> 00:23:01.785
And they continue with it, “Oh I’m very quiet. Yes I’m all right,

00:23:01.906 --> 00:23:06.479
I’m very peaceful, I’m never agitated, I’m absolutely relaxed."

00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:10.118
And you can see his nose is jumping, his eyes are jumping,

00:23:10.239 --> 00:23:13.614
his head is jumping and he is supposed to be the most relaxed person.

00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:16.512
“Oh, I felt very peaceful, very happy, no doubt."

00:23:16.633 --> 00:23:17.633
How can you?

00:23:17.754 --> 00:23:20.234
With bhoots, how can you? I mean I know you cannot

00:23:20.355 --> 00:23:23.114
but I’ve seen many people telling Me this story,

00:23:23.262 --> 00:23:28.615
oh they felt very nice with the guru and they felt very peaceful with the guru,

00:23:28.735 --> 00:23:32.364
and then you become dishonest.

00:23:32.485 --> 00:23:36.200
Just to support that guru one becomes dishonest.

00:23:36.379 --> 00:23:38.528
So we come back to the same point,

00:23:38.653 --> 00:23:42.164
that all these elements are honest,

00:23:42.285 --> 00:23:43.796
they’re absolutely honest.

00:23:43.917 --> 00:23:46.900
Whatever is their quality they profess that.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:53.270
A fire will not say that, “I will cool you down,” it will not say.

00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:56.202
But after realization so many of you must have noticed

00:23:56.322 --> 00:24:01.219
that if you put your hands to the fire you’ll get cool breeze coming out of it.

00:24:01.387 --> 00:24:04.699
Because it burns away whatever is ugly,

00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:09.539
whatever is bad in you, and you’ll get the cool breeze

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.672
from everywhere then, because that part is burnt away.

00:24:12.793 --> 00:24:15.551
It does the work of burning away

00:24:15.684 --> 00:24:18.691
and when it burns away then you put a hand towards the fire

00:24:18.812 --> 00:24:22.406
and you are surprised that from the flame the cool is coming out.

00:24:22.531 --> 00:24:26.230
Instead of burning me, how the flame is cooling me.

00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:30.578
So the quality, whatever they represent,

00:24:30.757 --> 00:24:34.609
they have within themselves built-in and they are honest.

00:24:34.742 --> 00:24:36.590
They are not dishonest,

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.344
because they are absolutely one with the divine laws.

00:24:41.616 --> 00:24:45.027
But human beings are not like that they play tricks here, there, that.

00:24:45.148 --> 00:24:49.106
That’s why to give realization to human beings is a very difficult thing.

00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:51.507
Now I’ll also tell you about the swayambhu things

00:24:51.628 --> 00:24:53.026
that come out of Mother Earth.

00:24:53.146 --> 00:24:57.190
You see the Mother Earth sends out certain forms

00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:02.144
above Her being for you people to see that there are vibrations.

00:25:02.264 --> 00:25:04.896
To work out Her spiritual thing

00:25:05.017 --> 00:25:09.482
by which She makes the spirituality emit among you,

00:25:09.603 --> 00:25:15.611
by which She guides you, by which She creates a nucleus for you to worship

00:25:15.732 --> 00:25:20.581
and this work She does in a very honest manner.

00:25:20.701 --> 00:25:23.654
But when such a swayambhu – things comes out,

00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:27.301
you can’t understand why people are attracted to it.

00:25:27.421 --> 00:25:33.031
So then you become a sort of, in charge of that thing.

00:25:33.151 --> 00:25:37.210
Then you want to make artificial images of that, it’s human nature,

00:25:37.331 --> 00:25:41.190
to make everything that you see real, make it artificial.

00:25:41.311 --> 00:25:43.299
And that goes on and on and on,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:48.518
till human beings themselves become so identified with their artificiality

00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:51.955
that they don’t understand what reality is.

00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:57.167
In reality whatever you are, you are the highest.

00:25:57.343 --> 00:26:01.659
You are the highest epitome of all the creatures.

00:26:01.841 --> 00:26:05.409
Even the thing that comes out of the Mother Earth

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:10.475
cannot do the work that you can. It cannot raise the Kundalini,

00:26:10.596 --> 00:26:14.190
it cannot, no maybe a little bit, effects might be,

00:26:14.311 --> 00:26:17.776
but it won’t work out with that force with that maneuvering I mean

00:26:17.897 --> 00:26:24.729
you are like a very advanced machinery of God’s work,

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:30.100
very advanced, extremely sharp, and extremely effective.

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:34.001
And the problem is this brain of yours, you see, when it comes in between,

00:26:34.122 --> 00:26:36.928
which is nothing compared to that big brain, you see.

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:41.592
Your brain is nothing but like a little mosquito, it comes up, comes here

00:26:41.713 --> 00:26:44.103
and there, says, “Oh, this, this, this, this, this”

00:26:44.224 --> 00:26:45.962
and then the problem starts.

00:26:46.083 --> 00:26:50.760
But if you really start using this power within you,

00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:55.838
God has made you as the best instrument that you could think.

00:26:55.975 --> 00:26:59.940
And as you start using your instrument with that wisdom

00:27:00.061 --> 00:27:06.229
and surrender or humility, gradually it evolves more and more and more,

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:13.260
and you start developing more sensitive sides, or we can say

00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:16.779
evolving a new method in this

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:22.575
and getting a better and better understanding of the working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:26.573
So it is important that first of all you must decide

00:27:26.694 --> 00:27:30.998
to stop the brain working too much and say that

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:32.725
“Mother You be in our brain."

00:27:32.846 --> 00:27:36.039
Thank God I’m before you in person, it’s not difficult.

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:39.581
Just say that “Mother, You have to be in our brain."

00:27:39.702 --> 00:27:44.780
Now this brain is as you know, is supported by the five elements,

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.350
they all are in this brain and if you can somehow or other

00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:53.034
bring Me in that brain, somehow or other, by telling your brain,

00:27:53.155 --> 00:27:57.175
now, not to disturb you any more, you’ll be amazed that

00:27:57.296 --> 00:28:03.463
immediately the whole system will start working like a dynamo.

00:28:03.776 --> 00:28:06.844
It will be such a sensitive thing, you don’t have worry about anything,

00:28:06.964 --> 00:28:08.616
don’t have to think about anything.

00:28:08.737 --> 00:28:12.542
You touch anything it becomes gold sort of thing, you see becomes Midas’ touch,

00:28:12.663 --> 00:28:14.095
becomes such a great thing.

00:28:14.216 --> 00:28:17.104
But that, to achieve, is difficult for human beings.

00:28:17.291 --> 00:28:22.744
They find it difficult to achieve that kind of a perfection

00:28:22.865 --> 00:28:29.281
where you lose completely your ego and you become egoless.

00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:34.521
Like the fire, the Mother Earth, like all other elements – they have no ego.

00:28:34.642 --> 00:28:36.814
It’s only human beings who have built the ego.

00:28:36.935 --> 00:28:40.978
And the ego is such a big myth. Of course when you don’t do anything,

00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:43.736
why should you think you are doing something,

00:28:43.857 --> 00:28:46.986
and why should you be responsible for doing anything?

00:28:47.115 --> 00:28:49.659
But the thing is, we think that,

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.572
“No it’s not God, we have to do this thing,” and “I have to decide."

00:28:54.693 --> 00:28:58.157
You see it’s just we play tricks with ourselves morning till evening

00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:02.009
spoiling our brain, absolutely becoming mad.

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.267
Best thing is to surrender

00:29:04.388 --> 00:29:07.382
and see the things will come before you, you’ll be amazed,

00:29:07.503 --> 00:29:10.978
oh, how it has happened, how it has worked out.

00:29:11.099 --> 00:29:14.360
The other day I told just Kerry, “You better go and register yourself."

00:29:14.481 --> 00:29:19.007
She said, “Mother the university has closed down these days,

00:29:19.128 --> 00:29:21.375
I can’t get into it, it’s very difficult."

00:29:21.572 --> 00:29:24.040
I said, “All right I’ve said it, you go."

00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:27.118
Then she telephoned, they said, “It’s impossible, you just can’t do it

00:29:27.259 --> 00:29:28.869
but if you want you can come and see."

00:29:28.994 --> 00:29:31.432
And as she walked into the university in the office

00:29:31.553 --> 00:29:34.230
they said, “All right, come along you are registered."

00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:42.189
It is, so many times it will happen to you people.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:49.306
But it took about ten minutes for Me to convince her that you just try it.

00:29:49.427 --> 00:29:53.511
But I must say still she was not so adamant she was thinking,

00:29:53.632 --> 00:29:57.493
” If Mother is saying, I may get it this thing, it will work out."

00:29:57.614 --> 00:30:02.743
But if you suppose, “It’s all right, Mother You are saying, I’m just going to register, finished."

00:30:02.864 --> 00:30:07.571
Then what happens even if you do not get registered doesn’t matter.

00:30:07.699 --> 00:30:11.844
That’s not important. Your brain improves.

00:30:11.965 --> 00:30:15.735
That’s important, that your brain improves, it becomes more sensitive.

00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:19.727
It’s not important that the work should be done, that’s not important.

00:30:19.848 --> 00:30:22.732
What is important that in you brain you must get this idea that

00:30:22.852 --> 00:30:28.414
“Let me be enlightened, truly." All right? This is what one has to understand,

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:33.941
in a very subtle way that we all are very sensitive instruments

00:30:34.062 --> 00:30:37.669
made by God and all our energies are not yet working.

00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:40.097
So we have to supply energy to all our nerves

00:30:40.218 --> 00:30:44.184
and that’s only possible if we remove our blockages

00:30:44.304 --> 00:30:46.823
created by our ego and by our conditioning.

00:30:46.944 --> 00:30:50.773
If you can remove the blockages, all our nerves will become very sensitive.

00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:53.800
And that’s why, tell your mind that,

00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:57.364
“Now any further, you better put Mother down there."

00:30:57.484 --> 00:31:00.456
Now it is also expressed through the way you talk you see,

00:31:00.577 --> 00:31:03.616
you jabber, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab and nothing

00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:07.967
I’ve seen you jabbering and I say, all right, now?

00:31:08.088 --> 00:31:11.663
There is nothing to talk about, there’s nothing to say about it,

00:31:11.784 --> 00:31:17.323
it’s just there and if it’s just there then it is better to be done

00:31:17.444 --> 00:31:21.561
and to be executed, and it will work out.

00:31:24.226 --> 00:31:28.140
Because if you know how to talk too much then it’s difficult,

00:31:28.261 --> 00:31:31.218
it’s going to be difficult. Because you’ll not suck in anything

00:31:31.339 --> 00:31:33.984
within yourself, and you’ll always give explanations,

00:31:34.155 --> 00:31:39.619
you’ll always say, “Oh, maybe I thought, maybe this, maybe that."

00:31:39.747 --> 00:31:43.720
A simple example, say for example I say, “Oh, I think I brought -”

00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:47.100
If I say I think I brought, I mean something with it.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.389
I say, “I’ve brought my chappals with me."

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:54.251
The other person, “No, I think…” finished.

00:31:56.033 --> 00:32:00.194
May not be true, I may not be true at all when I’m saying that, you see,

00:32:00.314 --> 00:32:04.020
I may be saying it just to test you.

00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:09.689
And to say maybe “Then, let’s see, all right."

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:16.771
Try. Once or twice you say, that whatever you know so far you say must be,

00:32:16.892 --> 00:32:19.646
if Mother says so, must be.

00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:23.518
Just try to train your mind that way.

00:32:23.638 --> 00:32:28.025
I tried these tricks and I find mostly they fail, then I give up.

00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:30.275
Mostly they fail.

00:32:34.697 --> 00:32:38.240
And they just can’t understand how these things happen, and

00:32:38.361 --> 00:32:43.181
how what Mother says comes true and how that thing works out this way and…

00:32:43.302 --> 00:32:45.999
But now understand that, I am just playing tricks with you,

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:50.068
just to make you understand that put your mind absolutely at rest

00:32:50.189 --> 00:32:54.832
and let the big Ahamkara, the Mahat Ahamkara take over,

00:32:54.953 --> 00:33:00.947
the Mahat ego, the great ego of God take over and you’ll get it, all right?

00:33:02.103 --> 00:33:04.023
May God bless you.

00:33:09.811 --> 00:33:14.289
It’s better now, I think the brain activity has stopped quite a lot.
