1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,055
Rahuri is a place where a rakshasa called,

2
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:12,806
demon called Rahu was killed by Goddess.

3
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:18,536
And this is the place where my forefathers

4
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:25,845
reigned as kings, and they had a dynasty
also.

5
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:31,238
Now, the other place we went to, Musalwadi,
is the place where

6
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:38,216
the Goddess first of all hit him with
a beam,

7
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:44,203
so it is called as Musalwadi. It means
a beam, ‘musal’ means a ‘beam’.

8
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:48,100
So this is a place where [the] Goddess has
done a lot of work.

9
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:53,398
here is another place called Aradgaon where
he was running and he was screaming,

10
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:57,895
so it’s called as arad. ‘Arad’ means
‘screaming’ (‘gaon’ means village).

11
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:00,851
So the whole place is already very much
vibrated

12
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:06,966
because also the Nathas, the nine Nathas —
we saw one Kanifnath there —

13
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,268
but all of them lived in this area and
worked very hard.

14
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:15,098
The last of all, Sainath, was very near
here, as you know, in Shirdi.

15
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:18,637
So this is a very, very holy place

16
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:23,806
and a place of great worship

17
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,796
where many a times the Goddess was
worshipped.

18
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,073
Rahuri itself, if you go round,

19
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:32,496
you’ll find there are nine deities sitting
there.

20
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:37,272
These are also created by Mother Earth.
They are beautiful things.

21
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,424
No one knows about them. You can go and
have a look.

22
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:47,242
There are nine of them and these represent
the nine incarnations of the Goddess,

23
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:52,920
or nine styles of the Goddess.

24
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:59,211
Now, in this beautiful place we are here,

25
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:03,976
though it is spoiled by many things, but,
as you can see,

26
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:08,994
it’s very comfortable for our Spirit to be
here.

27
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:16,843
At this place I have seen a negativity,
kind of a thing, was working out

28
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:19,873
about [which] I want to tell you today
again.

29
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:25,095
That works out everywhere wherever there is
a leadership of a person.

30
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:29,058
Here Mr. Dhumal came and he got his
Realisation,

31
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:35,728
in Bombay, at my residence. And he came
back [and] he started working it out here.

32
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:40,002
His brother brought him, but his brother
became quite negative to begin with,

33
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,140
and then the negativity started working out

34
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,858
and people started opposing him and
troubling him

35
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:49,003
and I had to go through a very difficult
period during that time.

36
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:52,302
So now, as you are travelling, I want
to tell you:

37
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:54,478
don’t challenge your leaders.

38
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:58,838
Because not only that it disturbs the whole
organisation,

39
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,169
but it gives me a physical manifestation;
I suffer physically.

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,226
Specially if you come and say things
against the leader

41
00:03:07,427 --> 00:03:10,530
in my presence I feel even worse.

42
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:14,187
And once it happened that somebody was
talking about a leader

43
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:16,924
and the whole of my back became so red

44
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:24,396
that lots of blisters came out, I suffered
a lot.

45
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:27,993
So I beg of you not to decide about
the leaders

46
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:33,159
and don’t try to criticise them and take up
the ego position

47
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,439
and try to see that, “He’s like this, he’s
hot tempered” or “He is this, that.”

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,359
They have to be hot tempered! Because
I’m not.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,150
Because I cannot be very angry, they have
to protect me.

50
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:47,939
As my protection, they have to be
hot-tempered and they have to tell you off.

51
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,985
And if they tell off, then you should not
feel

52
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:53,641
that they are bossy or they are doing these
things and all that.

53
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:56,178
Actually those people who are bossy only
feel it,

54
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,061
because they can’t bear that others can
tell them anything.

55
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:03,814
So they think that others are bossy and
they are fine: that’s not so.

56
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:06,357
So the trouble is that one should
understand

57
00:04:06,558 --> 00:04:10,455
that one has to work in this fashion.
I know what the leaders are.

58
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:14,302
When I find the leaders are going wrong,
immediately I try to correct them.

59
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,568
But you should not try to challenge
the leaders.

60
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,248
But this is the greatest problem I had
in the West

61
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,371
and later on I found here also, in India,
it used to brew up.

62
00:04:26,572 --> 00:04:29,995
Whenever I went away, then it started off:
the leader was challenged.

63
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:34,277
As if I don’t know about the leaders, as if
I don’t know anything about them,

64
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,396
as if I am to be told, as if I am
absolutely ignorant.

65
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:42,239
So you don’t have to worry. You shouldn’t
worry about it.

66
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,694
I will tell you who is the leader and how
to work it out.

67
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:48,550
It sometimes, of course, happens that
the leaders go off.

68
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:52,267
I know that they go off. It happens that
they fall a trap

69
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,698
to a wrong person. It’s quite possible;

70
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:57,730
after all they have become leaders just
like you,

71
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,664
with my special permission.

72
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:02,123
But could be such a situation can come up

73
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:04,645
and I want to then correct them and I
always tell them that,

74
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,567
“This is a wrong thing you have done.
This is to be corrected.”

75
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:11,166
But otherwise the whole administration
of Sahaja Yoga is impossible.

76
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,360
It has to work through the leaders.

77
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:16,578
You shouldn’t see how they talk, what they
say to you,

78
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,871
what they work out, but do what they tell
you.

79
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,282
There is no freedom lost in that.

80
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,737
You will see that your freedom will be
maintained,

81
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:26,036
respected and will be done.

82
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:32,370
On the contrary, I will say, when there is
a sloppy and a mild leadership

83
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,590
it’s just impossible. Everybody else
becomes the leader.

84
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,076
Like England, we can say, that Gavin was
very, very mild

85
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,278
and now there are so many leaders who
come up,

86
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,280
talk big, “Do this! Do that!”

87
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:48,070
I’m having a big problem in England of so
many mushroom-like egos coming up.

88
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:52,358
And they become so flippant and
nonsensical, and they talk all nonsense,

89
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,913
they start giving lectures, this, that.

90
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:56,533
It’s impossible then to control.

91
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,138
If Gavin was a strong fellow he would have
put them right.

92
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,856
But he’s too good and too much of
a gentleman, I think.

93
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:05,067
That much of gentlemanliness is of no use
in Sahaja Yoga.

94
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:08,592
So if he had handled the whole situation,

95
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:11,655
with that thing is all right, and would
have worked out very well.

96
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:16,346
But sometimes also the leader is told
to shut up, “You shut up!”

97
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:17,930
And like that he goes on shutting up.

98
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,059
Everybody joins hands and shuts up
the leader

99
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,829
and the leader becomes absolutely
a cabbage — he doesn’t say anything.

100
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,037
So this is also a very bad habit is to say,
“Shut up! Don’t say anything!”

101
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,456
I don’t like it. If somebody is talking
to me,

102
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,704
you shouldn’t just in front of me say,
“Shut up!” to that person

103
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:38,227
or pull his hand, or just punch him;

104
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,623
I don’t like all that, at all. That hurts
me.

105
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:42,644
You should never do like that. I have seen
people

106
00:06:42,845 --> 00:06:45,447
have a this very bad habit, “Don’t say!”
“Don’t talk!”

107
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:49,418
As if they are the greatest, wisest people
ever born to say such a thing:

108
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,208
is a very wrong idea and this should not
be done.

109
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,696
This should never be done in my presence,
I don’t like it,

110
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:59,382
it hurts me, and physically it manifests.

111
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,771
So don’t do like this, don’t say anything,
don’t do it! I know how to handle it.

112
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:06,238
If somebody is very funny I can tell that
person, “Now stop it!”

113
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,181
I can do it. But you just don’t try to take
over things like that.

114
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,923
Of course the leaders can do it,

115
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:17,094
leaders, the ones who are grown up,
matured people,

116
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:19,328
can just tell them to keep quiet.

117
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:22,616
But all the time some people have the habit
of saying, “No!” and “No!”

118
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,340
It’s bhootish, I would say. It’s really
bhootish.

119
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,353
Because they never allow me to see
the reality.

120
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:32,368
We must know what’s happening, what people
have to say. I should know about it.

121
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,659
There’s nothing wrong in it. But on
the contrary, they come and tell me,

122
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,481
“Our leader is like that, our leader is
like that.”

123
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:43,799
That you don’t worry because my attention
is most on your leaders.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,562
I do change leaders and I will change
leaders in case they are wrong.

125
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:51,639
But let me decide. That decision you leave
it to me.

126
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,858
So this is another point I wanted to say
about Rahuri,

127
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,610
which I learnt a lesson here. Then another
thing I found out:

128
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,386
The villagers here are much more easily
convinced,

129
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:04,852
they take to Sahaja Yoga very well.

130
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:08,353
And while the educated take time to take
to Sahaja Yoga;

131
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,288
naturally because they think they are very
well educated!

132
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,910
And they find it difficult to forget their
education

133
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:17,876
and become simpler people. So in the same
way, you will find the simple people

134
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:21,725
will take to Sahaja Yoga much faster than
the people who are educated;

135
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:26,388
because their mind works too fast, they
cannot catch the vibrations.

136
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,067
The mind is running fast, the vibrations
are running after them

137
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:33,822
and it’s a big game of hide and seek going
on! But doesn’t matter.

138
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:39,054
Still, once that intelligent get to Sahaja
Yoga, then it works even wonders.

139
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:42,267
Once they get to it, they take time, no
doubt. They take time,

140
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:45,687
but once they take, get to it then it works
wonders.

141
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:50,796
So some people take [to] it easily, but
they don’t work out that well;

142
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:54,580
those who take with difficulty, work out
better;

143
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,323
in the sense that they can intelligently
manifest it

144
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:01,954
and talk to people and tell them about it.

145
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:04,294
So this is another thing one has to
remember that:

146
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:08,426
try to understand that through your
education you have not known anything.

147
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,262
Because you never felt vibrations, you did
not even know

148
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:13,582
that there was something like that
existing!

149
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,940
This is a new knowledge, absolutely
a new thing.

150
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,287
Absolutely it has nothing to do with your
degrees,

151
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:21,276
M.A.D. and Ph.D.s and all those things.

152
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:25,012
It is something else that is existing,
which you have to feel.

153
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:30,233
So if you take that simple attitude it
would be a better idea.

154
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:39,790
Now the fourth thing which upsets me is
grouping, to form a group.

155
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:42,848
That’s another very upsetting thing is
to form a group.

156
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:47,735
This is one group of this place or group
of that place: who belongs to this place.

157
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:52,503
And this grouping, once it takes place
there is a gap in the collective.

158
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:57,071
When there’s a grouping, say, a nose and
eyes they become one group;

159
00:09:57,272 --> 00:09:59,512
then there’s a gap between them and
the hands.

160
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:03,688
So if there’s a problem in the nose,
the hands will not act.

161
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:08,275
So the whole activity becomes
a disintegrated activity.

162
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,038
So one should never form a group.

163
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:14,517
Those who have a habit of forming a group
must be completely discouraged.

164
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:18,986
They start saying against somebody, then
against that one, then this that,

165
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,767
then they form a group, the one group goes
there, one group.

166
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:25,221
So grouping is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
it is malignancy.

167
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:29,280
It is malignancy. If it starts working out,
you become malignant.

168
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:33,241
The whole group becomes malignant and
it’s a very difficult problem then

169
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:36,365
to put them right.

170
00:10:36,566 --> 00:10:43,404
And one should not accept any sort of
a sloppy or a very mild leadership also.

171
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:46,380
One should accept a strong,

172
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,888
fierce, I would say, to some extent,
leadership. That will help.

173
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,172
Because our ideas are very different from
what you have had so far,

174
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:58,149
“The leader should be pleasing to us. He
should have a personality

175
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,719
that will be extremely lovey-dovey type.”
That’s not so.

176
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,240
The leader has to be a strong, fierce
personality

177
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,901
that should make people respect him and
have awe for him.

178
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,650
But because we are so free we can pass
remarks

179
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,965
about the leader and say, “This leader
is bad, that leader is bad.”

180
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,957
But it’s not a good thing! It doesn’t help.
It doesn’t help.

181
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:22,090
On the contrary, as I told you, the sloppy
people create horrible problems!

182
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,398
And then you get so many egoistical people
who come up.

183
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:29,247
I mean a sloppy person, if there’s one
sloppy person,

184
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:34,006
or who has accepted such a domination,
if he is there as a leader,

185
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,393
all the rest of the people, those who come
in contact

186
00:11:37,593 --> 00:11:39,990
with that person, also become ego-oriented.

187
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:43,077
They also start behaving in such a manner
that you can’t imagine.

188
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:47,113
Like Gavin’s is a very good example:

189
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:50,729
in his office he had arranged work for
some people.

190
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,285
Everyone who worked in his office got
into this trouble,

191
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:57,745
because he was so good that they picked up
their ego, you see,

192
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:01,643
because the superego was there,

193
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:05,370
so they thought better to use your ego and
that’s how the whole thing worked out.

194
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,475
Poor fellow had to ask all of them to get
out of the office.

195
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:12,962
So this is an example for us and there’s
nothing to feel

196
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:17,251
that it is any criticism of anything.

197
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,017
But it doesn’t work out, this system
doesn’t work out.

198
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:29,304
So you should not try to make an effort
that you criticise them.

199
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,833
Now, another thing about leadership I have
to tell you

200
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,888
[is] that supposing I have appointed
Christine as a leader.

201
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,840
She is the leader of North America:

202
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:41,315
then she has to take the decisions for
North America.

203
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:44,509
But nobody else, not even her husband
should take any decisions.

204
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,011
He should not. He should have nothing
to do. He should be in the background.

205
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:51,834
Whosoever is the leader should deal with
the problem.

206
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:55,537
This is the trouble is, if the wife is
there, then the husband takes over,

207
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:58,429
husband gets, then the wife. Like I should
say Poona,

208
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,337
Poona, I appointed somebody there, he was
shut down

209
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:03,736
and his wife took over; and the wife is
a horrid stuff.

210
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:06,261
I mean, I don’t know what to do with
such things.

211
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:09,495
It is very difficult that, if it’s
a husband, it’s a husband,

212
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:12,700
it’s a wife, it’s a wife. Then the wife
becomes little dominating,

213
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,004
the husband comes back and then the husband
starts ruling.

214
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:19,216
Then my attention is on the wife, here
the husband becomes…

215
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,259
In leadership there is nothing like husband
and wife. They have nothing to do.

216
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,169
Whosoever is the leader is to be accepted
as the leader,

217
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,521
whether he is the husband or the wife.
This is one thing:

218
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:31,276
in Sahaja Yoga there is no discrimination
between women and men.

219
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,123
Not that the men should always rule nor
the women should rule.

220
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,394
It is whosoever is appointed as the leader
is the leader.

221
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,424
I must tell you these things because these
little, little things

222
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:43,384
make such a difference to the whole
organisation

223
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:46,905
that I don’t know how to tell. Because
husband has no right as a leader.

224
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:51,205
He’s not appointed as a leader, so he has
no right as a leader.

225
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:55,489
If you all understand this point that
leadership is very important part.

226
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,446
It’s like the main organ of the body.

227
00:13:59,748 --> 00:14:03,358
And that leadership should not be
challenged at any cost, any time.

228
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,477
Like Dr. Sanghvi is the leader of Nasik.

229
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,980
So he is the leader. He has to do it.

230
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:14,301
It is he who decides, it is he who says.
Nobody should challenge it [him].

231
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:17,979
So we have got leaders of different places,
if you have any problems

232
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,900
about deciding who is the leader, you come
and ask me.

233
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:25,057
I always appoint one person. In Italy,
Gregoire, I don’t know why,

234
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:27,915
he said there should be two persons.
I don’t know why he said two.

235
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:29,856
But I told him, “Gregoire, it’s not a wrong
thing,”

236
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:31,728
but he just said, “No. You must have.”

237
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,122
And the second one was dropped out so
badly, I mean he really harmed us.

238
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:38,650
So just listen to me! I know, I understand.

239
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:41,582
Guido can say that, what has happened
in Italy,

240
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:43,480
is because they didn’t listen to me.

241
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,929
Here we are not to please everyone.

242
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,486
No, we are not here to take any voting
or anything.

243
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,984
We are here to do the job, and for doing
the job

244
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,788
we must take the right course, right
methods.

245
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:57,358
So those who think, “Oh, have three
of them then!”

246
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,592
Then, “Have five of them!” This is
nonsense!

247
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:03,355
For what? Just to pamper ego?

248
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,847
Any leader is as good as you people are,

249
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:08,661
[the] only difference is my attention is
on that leader.

250
00:15:08,862 --> 00:15:10,631
That’s why it works out better.

251
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,591
Don’t allow your ego to dominate you.

252
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,260
There’s nothing… What does he do? Poor
man, the leader now?

253
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:19,827
For example, I would say, Warren: he worked
so hard, he really laboured through.

254
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:22,517
And he worked so hard he got so sick.
I was wondering.

255
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:26,893
It’s all right for me. I am after all
a Adi Shakti,

256
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:31,407
so it doesn’t matter I can be, I can be
a marathon.

257
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:35,358
But this fellow was working with me. I knew
he’ll have to give way at a point.

258
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,335
It’s too much. And then people start
criticising Warren, I can’t understand.

259
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:44,244
I mean, he is working day in and day out.
Can’t they see this?

260
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,247
Without him what would have happened
to us?

261
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:51,360
I mean, those who are leaders work so hard,
they do so much

262
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,854
and then you start criticising. That’s not
proper.

263
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:57,406
That’s being a bit ingratitude towards
them and towards me.

264
00:15:57,606 --> 00:16:01,823
On the contrary, I feel so much obliged
to them. After all this is my job.

265
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:05,260
This is I am paid for it, I can say.

266
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:08,726
So I am doing this job, all right. But what
about them?

267
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,513
They are human beings, they have got their
other things.

268
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:15,576
I don’t have to earn money, I don’t have
any problems.

269
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,507
So why? Why bother them?

270
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,937
They are the ones who have dedicated
their lives doing so much,

271
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:23,576
and then you start criticising them.
It is impossible.

272
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:27,127
But if he says anything to you, “Don’t do
this, and don’t do that!”

273
00:16:27,328 --> 00:16:30,463
And sometimes it is with my consultation
he does it.

274
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:34,307
Which things I cannot say directly, he
might say indirectly to you.

275
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:36,240
So you shouldn’t challenge such things.

276
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:39,275
This is one of the things today I wanted
to talk, about leadership,

277
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:44,858
because this is a place where I have faced
some problems of leadership.

278
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:51,255
And one should understand that this is the
only way Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

279
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:55,725
In the body also, as you know, it is not
that the heart,

280
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:59,367
which is the heart, is the complete pumping
source.

281
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:01,759
Now the heart’s work is to be accepted:

282
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,219
that it is this pumping source, and it
gives to all the other organs.

283
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,749
So liver is liver, brain is brain.

284
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,276
Brain doesn’t want to become the heart,

285
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:10,983
heart doesn’t want to become the liver.

286
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:16,404
Now the liver cells, if they say that, “Now
we will work for the heart!”

287
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:20,883
or “We’ll form a group!” then how can you
do it?

288
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:24,206
So as we have got very important organs,

289
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:27,705
we have got very important leaders. And
I know what they are up to,

290
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:31,228
I know what’s wrong with them, so you leave
it to me to correct them.

291
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:33,515
All right, this is for the foreigners
today.

292
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:36,580
Because now we’ll be moving further and
further

293
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:39,542
into more difficult time, I think, because
there may be

294
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:43,041
little spartan living for you because you
asked for it!

295
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:47,139
You wanted to have a camping ground, so I
have arranged a camping ground for you.

296
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,549
So then you should not say [about]
the leader,

297
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:52,670
“Where is he? Now call him! What have
you done?”

298
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,219
It’s all arranged by me, so don’t blame
him. And enjoy yourself.

299
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,473
And don’t try to say that it’s he who
should have looked after:

300
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:03,183
he’s not paid for it. He’s not paid for it.

301
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,453
I am paid for it. They are not.

302
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:09,799
In the sense [that] I am paid because I am
made for that.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,803
It’s my job. I am doing it because I have
to do it.

304
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:17,302
I cannot do anything else but to do this
job, otherwise I won’t exist, you see.

305
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:20,535
So mine is a different point. But if he’s
doing it,

306
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:23,412
then it is an obligation on me. And in
a way I feel,

307
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,795
and you all should feel, also, obliged.

308
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:28,798
May God bless you all.

309
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:34,250
[Marathi Talk for 10 minutes, the
Shri Mataji talks again in English]

310
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:37,274


311
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,888
A saint will never criticize another saint.
Is never done.

312
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:28,513
Saint will always appreciate another saint.

313
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:31,312
And also a devil will, no doubt.

314
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:37,663
But if you are neither a devil nor a saint,
then you start criticizing each other.

315
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:39,903
So don’t criticize each other.

316
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:44,394
You are all saints of a very high quality,
don’t criticize each other.

317
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:46,535
See for yourself what’s wrong with you,

318
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:49,402
why are you seeing all the bad points
of another person?

319
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:55,011
Why don’t you see your bad points? It’s
an obtuse angles.

320
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:58,093
You see, with an obtuse angle if you are
looking at people, you see,

321
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:02,415
then you see things which do not exist,
which are not good for you.

322
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,546
So develop a kind of a sensitivity

323
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:07,491
by which you see your own problems and
not others’.

324
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,809
If you start finding faults with others,
immediately put back to yourself:

325
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,376
“Why? What’s wrong with me?”.

326
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,414
If somebody you call your leader, or
anybody a bossy person,

327
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:22,253
see: are you a bossy person yourself?
You must be.

328
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:27,499
Then it will be all right. Because it is in
Sahaja Yoga there is nothing hidden,

329
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,141
nothing kept secret, everybody knows
about everyone.

330
00:29:31,342 --> 00:29:34,036
Because whatever I may say today, tomorrow
you’ll be so changed

331
00:29:34,236 --> 00:29:39,911
I will not even be able to recognize you.
It is going to be so much difficult

332
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,714
to recognize you, because you are growing
so fast.

333
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,806
So keep to the growth, keep to the growth.

334
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:51,309
Thank you very much. It is so that today
the puja had to start late,

335
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:54,632
because you know, there are certain things…

336
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,164
I just blame other things which nothing
is there,

337
00:29:57,365 --> 00:30:01,390
you cannot blame anyone, that has to be,
that has to be.

338
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:03,188
I was born at 12 o’clock, you see,

339
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:07,961
so to start puja before that is something
out of place.

340
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:10,395
And I have to wait till twelve to pass out
nicely,

341
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:15,647
so that I should try and awake myself

342
00:30:16,078 --> 00:30:20,326
to my responsibility and all the deities
must be awakened.

343
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,890
You see, they have their own style and
their own timings

344
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:26,716
and I cannot force them to do what I want
to do or [what] you want to do.

345
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:33,304
It’s another style. They are so bound, that
I cannot force them anything.

346
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:36,726
You also should know my helplessness
about it.

347
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,962
Thank you very much.

348
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:37,663
After the puja you must mix up with these
people,

349
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,520
ask their names, talk to them, who they
are –

350
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:45,201
you must meet your brothers and sisters
from Rahuri.

351
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:41,793
Shri Mataji: Vibrations…

352
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:18,938
Shri Mataji: Take a bandhan. It’s a good
idea.

353
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:21,955
See, we have to be serious about it. We
must understand.

354
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:25,578
We are saints, and we should take it up
everything seriously.

355
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:28,960
It’s a tremendous task.
