00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
So, should I just start with the questions?

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.920
Yeah, I'll just tell a few words and then the questions. So first of all, I thank Shri Mataji

3
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:26.400
for giving me this opportunity to talk before my brothers and sisters. And thank you, Caroline,

4
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:36.960
thank you for inviting me. It's my pleasure to share some beautiful moments with Shri Mataji.

5
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.040
The fact that we came earlier does not, I always felt that, does not mean that we are more,

6
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.480
how do you say, we have progressed more or anything like that. It's only that somehow it

7
00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.400
was in our, it was our good fortune that Shri Mataji brought us in Sahaja Yoga earlier.

8
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.560
And I always feel it's like a lift which goes from the ground floor to the seventh floor.

9
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.760
We became on the first floor, the lift comes on the fourth or fifth floor and everybody's at the

10
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.400
same level. It's a collective consciousness. And secondly, we are, when I see some of these

11
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.360
young ones who are so dynamic, so deep, and it gives me a lot of hope for Sahaja Yoga

12
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.520
for the future. And only thing is, if I may say, we saw Sahaja Yoga right from the,

13
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.280
some few droplets, now it's become a big river. I'm sure it will become the sea and then the ocean.

14
00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:02.240
So that's the, that's the advantage you can see. This is for all the Sahaja Yogis,

15
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.520
what I'm seeing, and these experiences I have just selected, which are more collective.

16
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:16.640
Whatever Shri Mataji has told us, very personal things, or you know, very, very personal lives,

17
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.880
which are not very much useful for the collective, I'm not included in this. Same with the photos.

18
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:33.200
Okay, so we can start the question. So how and when did you get your realization?

19
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:43.920
It was in 1972, the 14th of April 1972, that I got my realization.

20
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.200
Along with me, actually, my sister also, we were in a place called Jeevanjod. So I'm telling you

21
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.000
these places in case somebody wants to go, when you're going to Mumbai, you can visit these places.

22
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:04.000
There was a big road called Nepentia, Nepentia road, and there was a cross road, a settlement

23
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.680
cross road. So it is a dead end road, sort of, you cannot go to the other side. So at the end,

24
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.400
there was a sea and on the left hand side, there's a building which you enjoyed, and Shri Mataji was

25
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:25.360
staying on the second floor. And Sarsipi had a flat there. And Shri Mataji used to invite all of us

26
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.160
about 10 o'clock in the morning and give us realization, we were maybe 30, 40, whatever.

27
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:42.640
And then we had to go on our feet or on our hands. So when my turn came, it was in the hand,

28
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:52.400
left hand, and she put oil on my head. She asked me, how do you feel? I said, fine. Then she

29
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.440
asked my name and she liked my name. That was it. It was the beginning of the journey.

30
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.880
Wow. And that's 50 years ago now? Yes.

31
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.080
Wow. So the next question is if you can tell me something about the early days,

32
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.360
and you want me to share the photos straight away or you want to?

33
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.040
Yes please. I will tell you early days, I will tell you along with the photos and each photo

34
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.280
and there is some story behind it. And that's why I've sort of selected.

35
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:37.920
So you'll have to excuse any mistakes on my part because some of the photos are in a different

36
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.480
medium. So we might, I might have to... This is fine. So these are my parents.

37
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.760
The story behind it is that it was in 1973. These years I remember because we were in school.

38
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.440
So it was the last year in school and my sister, myself, we could not go. And my parents went.

39
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.440
So it is a place called Wasai, which is rather far from Bombay. And you go by suburban train

40
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.680
on the Western line. And my father said, how can Sri Mataji come in the second class or third class

41
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.320
at that time? And he took first class tickets, but Sri Mataji came with all the Sahaja Yogis

42
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.160
in the third class with all the Sahaja Yogis. And they went to this place called Wasai

43
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:40.080
and the photo was taken there. So Sri Mataji went to UK. She sort of moved to UK in December 73.

44
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:48.000
And each time when she used to come and while going back, it was always very emotional moment.

45
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.720
She used to have all the women, but not all of them. And then she used to go. So this is one

46
00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.040
of the photos. It was in Santa Cruz airport. There was only the Santa Cruz international airport.

47
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:10.880
So this is the photo. And whenever we used to meet, Sri Mataji used to sit, eat with us.

48
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.840
So you see Sri Mataji sitting and eating with us on the side also. There are

49
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.280
there are these Yogis sitting. She used to sit on the ground and eat with us.

50
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.640
Okay. I have to stop sharing for a second because I need to

51
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.840
find the next photograph I think is in words. So I need to find that.

52
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.240
Here we are.

53
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:48.560
Yeah. So this is my father is holding this mic for Sri Mataji. And there's on the right hand side,

54
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:56.000
you can see a small tape recorder. The story was that this was the tape recorder which taped all

55
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.600
the talks from right from 1970 to Ringo Gauta realization till about 1780. It was the only one.

56
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.440
We had these spools. You see those spools? Six inch spools, four tracks,

57
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:20.560
3.5 hours each track. So it's 14 hours each spool. And we used to take that tape recorder everywhere.

58
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.720
And it was the only tape recorder from Bombay everywhere we used to go. We used to take that.

59
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.720
And all those old talks are coming from this. And in the story is that my father when he

60
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:44.720
saw first time he got his realization in January 73, 72, 72 January, he took us in April 72.

61
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.040
So when he heard you talking, he felt it was so deep and so powerful. And he said, really,

62
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.880
somebody should tape it. And a few days later, his friend said, I want to sell one tape recorder,

63
00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.200
would like to take it. And we bought it. And even once it was not working,

64
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:11.840
Shri Mataji had put kumkum on that. And the story was that 83 or 84, I think it was 84,

65
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:18.960
Shri Mataji sent a word with somebody saying that this man who's going to come, you give all the

66
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:32.560
spools to him. We had 36 spools because all those, you know, all those music, everything was in that

67
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:41.280
those spools. And Shri Mataji said, give these 36 spools to him. And I think so they went to the UK.

68
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.880
So this is the story of this tape recorder.

69
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.040
And I think there's another photograph in the same...

70
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.120
Yes, you can show. Now, this is the photo was taken in January or February,

71
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:06.000
1977. It was in Bodhi. And you can see some yogis which whom you can recognize that's Pat

72
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.920
right in the middle at the end. Then there is Maureen on the right on his left, there is

73
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:22.720
Givin in front of him, this Jane, I don't know if you know them. And on his left is Maureen.

74
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:28.560
And there were some rollbys on the left of Shri Mataji. I was sitting behind on the right.

75
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:39.520
Then there is Chavan uncle in the front on the left. And the mala uncle also there.

76
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.920
So this was in Bodhi.

77
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.640
Okay, so now we go back to the other...

78
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.400
Yes.

79
00:09:52.720 --> 00:10:09.040
So, this is in Bodhi before Ganapati Pulay. Ganapati Pulay started in December 85,

80
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:21.600
from 72-73 till 85 February. We used to go to Bodhi for the seminar. And I got married in

81
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:28.240
February 85 in Bodhi. That was the last Bodhi seminar. And these were the small group and

82
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.680
maybe 15-20 more. And this is this place called...

83
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.760
His name was Diwanji. His bungalow used to hire.

84
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.040
Ninakshi can sit in the front. You can see her.

85
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:54.160
Yeah, so this is the same photo which we saw just now in Bodhi. Should be in

86
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.760
77 January or February. Same photo, but it's not that clear.

87
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:12.640
Yeah, so this is the photo till... I don't know the year. Should be from 70 or 374 till

88
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.640
about 76. This was sort of the whole group.

89
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.320
Shrimathaji is in the middle. She is looking downwards.

90
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:36.400
We used to have pujas in Bodhi. This was the puja. We used to put water on Shrimathaji's feet.

91
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.080
My father used to...

92
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:47.200
Chand Mantras. This was the... We can say first puja in Sahaja Yoga. And this on the left.

93
00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:00.320
This was in the tour, India tour of 1979-80. I think somewhere in

94
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:10.000
in Bodhi, I think. And before the havan, she used to give instructions and I was writing down

95
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:19.840
all the instructions. And then she used to put kumkum for people who are sitting for the havan.

96
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.480
And all these photos are basically their presence from Western Sahaja Yogis who gave me

97
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.120
photos. So they are my personal archives. Unfortunately, I'm there in some of them.

98
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:47.840
So this is... We are preparing havan. The small girl standing on the right hand side of this

99
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:55.440
is Aradhana, the eldest granddaughter of Shrimathaji. On her right is Anupama,

100
00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:04.000
whom Shrimathaji is putting down kumkum. And yeah, you can just see my head on the right.

101
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.160
And there were some other people.

102
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.160
Yeah, she is putting kumkum to everybody.

103
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:27.440
This is also a photo where in the front, the two boys on the left in the front,

104
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:36.880
boy is Sandip Uddakari. Yes, that's Sandip Uddakari. And behind this, his name is Bankeem.

105
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.680
Staying in Borirgi, Navi is I think so in Dubai.

106
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.960
This is the same lot of photos.

107
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:56.480
Yeah, so this is the place called Nilambar. It was on the 13th floor in the building called

108
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:06.640
Nilambar, on the Pedda Road in Mumbai. In fact, in 78, I got my BSc and was trying for MSc.

109
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:13.760
And I did not get very busy. So my father said, you'll be with Shrimathaji since she's here.

110
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:22.880
And we were here. And here the first Sari marriage took place. And Shrimathaji was staying with us.

111
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:29.920
She was having a room, then another room for the ladies. Then we were sleeping in the living room.

112
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.960
So this is that photo.

113
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:44.320
So once Shrimathaji told us to go on the beach, and when she used to come, she used to always

114
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:56.000
crack jokes, always in a very jovial mood. And she was cracking some jokes.

115
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:07.360
This is in 83 in Raurie. She had allowed us to take some photos with her.

116
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:17.120
This is Mr. Dumal. Dumal's uncle, you know. He is sitting with Shrimathaji.

117
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:24.160
This is a group photo. The extreme right is Sandip's mother.

118
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.680
Then in Aksi, myself, Shrimathaji. Extreme left is Karakankari.

119
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.280
Shrimathaji allowed us to take photos with her.

120
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:53.040
Now, when I came to France, this photo was given to me as a present by one Mr. Warik Warik's uncle.

121
00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:03.120
And this was the photo which was on the passport of Shrimathaji when she first moved to the UK in

122
00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:11.520
December 73. And there were just three photos, original ones. And he had one of them. He gave me

123
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:19.280
his own photo and that time he could not make copies or anything. So it was quite a good present

124
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:31.360
which I digitalized for everybody. This was in 1990 in Mokarma Ashram in Paris.

125
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:38.960
Shrimathaji was giving Indian names to westerners. The person on the left you will see is

126
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:46.880
I think Sri Char from Holland. And I was writing them down with the meaning of the names.

127
00:16:46.880 --> 00:17:03.440
In 1978-79 I was with Shrimathaji almost for a year. And this was in 1979 in February,

128
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:10.160
10th to 16th February. It was a place called Ten Ashoka Road in New Delhi. And we were there

129
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:20.720
was a pandal and we used to have a public program every evening in this garden. So here were all

130
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:36.080
these other men. You must be knowing some of them in this photo. I'm sure everybody's changed a lot

131
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:42.480
since this photograph was taken. Yeah, yeah, I don't know. On the right you can see who's

132
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:52.160
thumb. Then sitting on the ankle, second on the right. Then there was this lynch who was the first

133
00:17:52.160 --> 00:18:01.360
person to get married on his right. Then there's a Buddha on the left hand side,

134
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:12.400
a dog with the mustaches. There is, what's his name? On the left hand side of Gavin,

135
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:24.560
he expired recently. Uncle Douglas and Don. That's right, that's right. It's Douglas.

136
00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:33.040
On the right in front of Gregor is Tony.

137
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.320
Then there was Don Divine. Don Divine. Don Divine, yes.

138
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:53.680
The word? Don. Don Divine. Don, Don, Don. Yeah, from Spain.

139
00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:03.680
I don't know whether you knew him or not. I don't know. And then on my left is Mr. Vinubopalan.

140
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:11.680
He's also one of the old sahaja yogis in Delhi. Then on the right of Srimathji,

141
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.160
sitting on the ground is Mr. Verma. He was always there with Srimathji for shopping and everything.

142
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:27.680
He was there. And then on the left hand side of Srimathji, on the ground is Mr. Sivamani.

143
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.200
He was always there with Srimathji for shopping and everything. He was there.

144
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:49.760
Okay. So these were the yoginis with Srimathji. On the left there was Phili Paar. She was a

145
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:59.200
journalist standing. Then there was Ellen on her left. Sitting on the second from the left is Chaya.

146
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:13.200
On the extreme right sitting is Marie. On her right is Jane. On her right there was a

147
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.520
Sajjhana. That's really fine. Then

148
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.440
there is a role by standing.

149
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:37.600
There was her sister on the left and another sister on the left, Ashaya and then Dhruva.

150
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.480
Yeah.

151
00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.280
So the photos are finished.

152
00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.240
Photos are finished.

153
00:20:52.880 --> 00:21:02.080
And just to tell you how it happened in the early days, sometimes when my father was coming

154
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:08.400
home late, he used to come at five, but in case he was late, he used to... We know that

155
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.200
he's gone to Srimathji's house. He used to call her, would like to come and meet. So he used to go.

156
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:23.200
1973 Navaratri Pudra, for example, we had nine days Uja on her terrace of Jeevan Jodh.

157
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:33.760
And once while answering to one question, she said that even one leaf cannot move in the world

158
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.960
without the orders coming from my Kundalini. She showed like this from her Kundalini.

159
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:48.560
And she used to massage her head with silvicrin. And in one of the talks in Marathi, she said even

160
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.760
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh cannot touch her head, but Sahaja Yogi, she is allowed to touch her head.

161
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.680
So she had given us... She has given us a lot of

162
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:10.160
rights. And for example, she came to our house three times, we had done Puja and

163
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:22.240
a lot of things. In Gikamandi hall in Bharti Deva in Mumbai, 73-74, we used to have public programs,

164
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.120
morning and evening. And after the public program, my free time used to go on her feet,

165
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.160
to do our prayers, all those memories.

166
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.960
So if you can ask me the questions,

167
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:51.760
Abdu, the photograph behind you has very good vibrations. Where are you at present? Where is that?

168
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.280
I'm at home.

169
00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.240
That's your home photograph, amazing vibrations. It's so clear. Very nice.

170
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.440
No, in fact...

171
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.280
When you say home, what country is that?

172
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:07.760
France.

173
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.280
France? France, yes.

174
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:16.720
I live in France, yes. I've made that photo as a photo of my wife.

175
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.160
I've taken a picture of that and it stays on my screen.

176
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.280
So if I move...

177
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:33.760
Yeah, it does not move. It's in the background.

178
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:42.000
So I'm looking at what you sent me and there's a few things I think that I can do.

179
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.120
So the bandhans for your exams?

180
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:53.920
Yes, yes. Now, there are a lot of things like, for example,

181
00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:03.520
she had corrected my covering letter for a job and sometimes some of us used to tell her,

182
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.360
she said, please put bandhan, I'm going to give my exam.

183
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:15.040
She used to put bandhan and also there was an instance of 85 birthday puja.

184
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:35.760
One of us gave her a ring and she said no. And then this person who was giving the ring,

185
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.520
just closed his eyes and immediately Shrimataji put her finger in the front and he

186
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.680
put the ring in her finger. Then I asked her, asked him, that person,

187
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:56.000
what did you, when you closed their eyes, what did you say? So that Shrimataji has opened the,

188
00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:05.120
given the finger. So he said, mother, let my desire be so pure that you accept my desire.

189
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:14.400
And then he said, no, please put this ring from me. And Shrimataji immediately put her

190
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:21.040
finger in the front. And many of the things like once there was in Bombay, there was,

191
00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.640
we used to get milk from Aare Milk colony. So it was the only source of getting milk in Bombay.

192
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.240
And they were on strike and there was not a drop of milk. But somewhere somehow they got some milk

193
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.120
and it was Shrimataji. And it was the first cup of tea. And

194
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.560
she poured half, half of that small cup in a saucer and gave me. I said, no, no, I don't want.

195
00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:57.120
She said, no, no, no, you take, I don't know how, maybe she drank some few drops. So all these small,

196
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.880
lots of small memories.

197
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:07.520
Did you say about coming to your house three times?

198
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:08.740
Yes.

199
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.280
And, but the kerosene from abroad, you haven't mentioned.

200
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:23.200
Yeah, because some, I mean, I had lung infection. And when I called Shrimataji, she said, no, no,

201
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.160
take everything what is necessary for your lung infection. She was in Australia. And she sent

202
00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:42.160
some kerosene. And it was really, really helpful to cure the lung problem. Then she said,

203
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:48.400
your father was very strict. And that's why you got this lung problem. But now it's much clear

204
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:55.520
because of this. So just to tell you that even if something bad happens, they certainly certainly

205
00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:03.680
something good is going to happen. So this is just truly I wanted to convey.

206
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.080
Can you tell me something about her availability for her children?

207
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:18.800
Yeah, in 73, 74, 75, I don't know the years exactly. So in a place called Prabhadevi is one

208
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:26.800
of these Ganesha. So I'm a Ganesha. Beside there is a gardening in front. There was this

209
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:33.200
old building that used to have the meditation right in the beginning. And we were just few. And

210
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:40.800
every year we used to have on the terrace, we used to have a pandal. Shrimataji used to come

211
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.720
for the birthday pooja. And Shrimataji used to come in the morning, used to have pooja, havan,

212
00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:55.760
used to sing songs. And that time we could not take vibrations. So we had to put our hand on her

213
00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:03.120
back, on her head like this. So in the evening, about nine, 10 o'clock, she used to go home.

214
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:08.800
And once I had this opportunity to go with her to her house because a lot of flowers were there.

215
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:15.280
And they said, how did you come to bring flowers? And she was staying in Karpal in Kalpana Devi's

216
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:22.160
house. And when I went, I saw that so many people had come about, I don't know, 30, 40,

217
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:28.240
Sursipi's colleagues, her family, friends, everybody to wish Shrimataji and Shrimataji

218
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:35.200
was with us for the whole day. So I really felt that how much time she had given to us,

219
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:42.160
especially from Bombay. There's a lot of things. Can I ask a question, Avadhut?

220
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:50.720
You mentioned Shrimataji sent some kerosene. I believe we call it Vaseline. Am I correct?

221
00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:58.960
No. You put it for the aeroplanes, that kerosene. It's liquid, it's a fuel.

222
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:11.280
Really? So, but that's like a petrol then? Yes. For burning, for cooking, for heating?

223
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.280
Yes. Mother was giving actual kerosene because in Portugal mother told us Vaseline instead of

224
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:24.720
kerosene. No, she said you mix it with olive oil because it smells quite strong. So mix it with

225
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.240
that and then put it on your chest. Right. So mixed with oil. Yes.

226
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:40.800
Because not, not, not, not just that. Because in Portugal, we did not have kerosene in Portugal,

227
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.240
not available. I know in France it's difficult to get.

228
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:52.080
Yes. Mother told us you could use Vaseline, you know, and basically probably similar to that.

229
00:29:52.960 --> 00:30:01.120
No, because she had it sent from Australia. There was Patrick Lantone was there. So she sent it.

230
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:10.400
Vaseline was made out of petrol. This is why she suggested the

231
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:20.720
Vaseline. Vaseline is also a sub-product from petrol in any case. So they are related,

232
00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.760
but different. This is slightly different. Thank you for that.

233
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:34.400
And so now I have, how she cleans her caramels? Yeah, basically I used to smoke even after

234
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.720
realization. I used to smoke two or three cigarettes per year. When with the friends,

235
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.560
I used to go out for a weekend. We used to drink smoke. So I used to smoke also just,

236
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.480
just like to give them company, you know, the friends are the force you and all that.

237
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:58.320
So once I was in Goa with another friend and I smoked and in one week,

238
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:08.560
5th of February, 76, there was a pooja. It's in Nagruta. So after the pooja, we used to go on our

239
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:16.000
feet. And when I went on our feet, Shri Mataji said that although I did smoke, suddenly my heart

240
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.560
really literally stopped. And I didn't say anything. And then again, I used to go with the

241
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.960
friends and again, I used to smoke. And then in 79, when I was in Durya in the Ralbhai's house,

242
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.920
they had a havan and there Shri Mataji said, I want somebody, a man who has never smoked in his

243
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.880
life. And all the Westerners, they said, no, they had smoked, even the Indians, they smoked

244
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:47.840
PDS. So they said, I pulled my ears and looked down. I said, no, not the second time. I'm not

245
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:53.200
going to go through the question. And I said, I smoked. I forgot about the incident. And then

246
00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.480
Shri Mataji did not. So in the evening, I started having a very strong smell from my

247
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.160
vishuddhi fingers. I don't know both of them, but anyway, they are the right one.

248
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:12.880
And they were so strong. We were in a small village, the public program, and I came home,

249
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:19.360
wash my hands properly, but still it did not go away. I was, I was getting worried now

250
00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:27.040
because we are all with Sahaja Yogis and it was rather strong. And so that time I used to go to

251
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:33.040
Shri Mataji's room. So I said, Shri Mataji, there's a problem. So she said, okay, come here. And she

252
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:40.480
took my fingers like this in her hands. And in about two, three minutes, she said, okay, now smell

253
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:48.880
and the smell is gone completely. So she said, because you've accepted this morning that you

254
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:58.000
smoked, I'm taking out all your smoke, all your cigarette from your body. Your karma means in your

255
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.520
life. If you tell somebody now that I've never smoked in my life, that is true. That's not false.

256
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.680
That part I've taken it out. So now again, you, you promised that I was not smoked. Of course,

257
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.280
I promised them I did not smoke. Then in the West, I had once a brain scan and once even

258
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:22.720
carotid artery, some doctor or something, two different doctors, they said, yes, the brain is

259
00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.280
so clear that you can see that you have never smoked in your life because any smoke, it gives

260
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:37.120
a stain. I said, yeah, I did not smoke, never smoked in my life. So this is how she in our karmas.

261
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.400
Wow. Wow. And then how does she clean us physically?

262
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:57.200
Now I always have, I'm very sensitive to sun. So if I go out in the sun, I have a headache.

263
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.720
And when we were in Nilamba, every means is to make us laugh with a lot of things, jokes,

264
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:08.560
and I was sitting with a very bad headache. So she said, what's happening? I said, really,

265
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.640
I've got a very bad headache. They'll come on. You put your hand on my liver. So I put my hand on

266
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:22.320
the newer and in about five, 10 minutes, I had to go for diarrhea, diarrhea, vomiting. And really,

267
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:31.520
literally I was completely vacuumed from inside. I came back, the headache was completely gone.

268
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:42.640
And also in this, it's called Akshay Trithya in our Indian. It's a very auspicious day during the

269
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:50.080
year. We used to have a puja in this place, Marve. And the whole day we used to be there with

270
00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:57.440
Shrimataji. And in the evening, once I remember, she told us to stand in a circle. We were,

271
00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:03.760
I don't know, something like 15 or 20. And she worked on us individually like this. You know,

272
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:09.520
you put all the things in the, and we were standing on the wet sand and she worked on us,

273
00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:16.160
everybody. And she said that wet sand, I remember, she said wet sand is the best element to take

274
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.960
everything what is blocking your body. It can really clean you very well. It's a very good

275
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:26.240
element. Wet sand, but on the seashore, not if you do. I don't think so. If you do it at home,

276
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:33.680
it will work. But then also we used to go to Gampati Puli and all. We can do this three

277
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:41.520
point treatment for the Muladhara. You sit on the ground with your legs, your feet, the heels

278
00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:51.760
in the ground, the knees bent. Your hands, you can put behind. So basically you touch with your

279
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.800
Muladhara, physically. You touch with the heels, which is the Muladhara, and with your hands.

280
00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:03.840
So three point treatment, we can really ask, because Gampati Puli is a very, very,

281
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.720
the best place to clear our Muladhara. So we ask Mother Earth to suck in all these Muladhara

282
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:20.080
problems. So we can do that also. And it says also, sitting in the sea with her feet towards

283
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:26.400
the sea. Yeah, because what happened was when we were small, I don't know where it was, but I

284
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:33.040
still remember these small incidents where she used to sit in the sea with her feet in the sea

285
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:39.280
like this. And the waves used to come. And we like small children used to go and put our head

286
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:45.040
against her feet. So when you imagine we were, our nose was in the water.

287
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.200
When the waves are coming and we used to, you know, do some sort of a competition,

288
00:36:51.200 --> 00:37:00.560
who will stay more in the, in the water. So the small little incidents and I did not realize

289
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.960
that she was really vibrating Arabian Sea.

290
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.480
And so you have some instances of how she knows what's going on in our mind?

291
00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:21.520
Yes, I had always this ear problem. And once my ear is too weak and all that,

292
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.440
so you put some drops, these, that, nothing happened. Nothing did not work out. And then

293
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:33.200
I went to Shri Mataji and said, please, can you just see, there's some problem? And she took her,

294
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.680
my left hand, my left ear with the right hand like this, and she started blowing.

295
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.640
So immediately a thought came in my head. All these medicines did not work, what this

296
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:53.120
blowing will work. And Shri Mataji immediately left the hand. She said, why are you thinking

297
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.000
like this? You know what I am putting? I am putting the real Pranava in your ear,

298
00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.280
obviously, because I doubted it never hit.

299
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.280
It says also here, couplets.

300
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.080
Yeah, and also couplets means we were in Rauri and after the

301
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.360
food used to say couplets, after marriages used to do couplets like that. So in the afternoon,

302
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:22.720
Shri Mataji, people used to ask Shri Mataji to ask some people to say the couplets. And I

303
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:30.640
immediately made a couplet. And I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was,

304
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:38.400
Shri Mataji didn't ask, so I did not say. You mean the same program happened? And then Shri

305
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:45.120
Mataji said, okay, now you say the couplet, a couplet also. So I sent the couplet and she said

306
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:51.760
immediately, but this couplet you had made in the morning. And I said, yes, yes, yes. And then she

307
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:59.600
said, how did I know? You know, how did I know? These are the small little incidences. And then

308
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:08.480
like once we went to Shri Mataji early in the morning and they did not have time to take our

309
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:15.920
bath. And immediately she was telling the listeners, ah, these people, when they come in the

310
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:22.720
morning, they always have their bath. My sister was there with me. So even she knows exactly,

311
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:30.960
but she's so diplomatic and we had to meet Adi Shakti, we had to take our bath. We had not done it.

312
00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:41.040
And Shri Mataji's reply concerning the, the fourth dimension?

313
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:48.560
Yeah. So in 77, we had been to Jaipur and Jaipur will get very good pearls. They are

314
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:55.680
very, very rough imitation pearls, but they are very, very good quality. So we had taken some

315
00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:03.440
pearls and then there's a very special sari, bandini sari from Jaipur. So I was a postman and my

316
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.400
father said, now did you take these for Shri Mataji? So I took all of them for Shri Mataji. And Shri

317
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:14.400
Mataji said, why are you bringing all this? Why are you bringing all this? I tried to be smart. I said,

318
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.920
what you have given us in the fourth dimension, this is just three dimensions.

319
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.080
So immediately she replied, so give me in the fourth dimension.

320
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.800
So this is now how she protects her children?

321
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:39.040
Yeah. So basically there are two real miracles in my life with Shri Mataji. One of them was my year,

322
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:46.320
the about my karma, how she took it out. And this is the second one, which I'm going to tell.

323
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.480
We have used to have this public programs. I told you in Gita Mandir all third floor

324
00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:01.280
Chawpatty and every evening to have that. And once for the Tepere Padar, I was sitting in the front

325
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.560
and Shri Mataji just looked somewhere. And in Marathi you call it Kataksha. Kataksha means

326
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:14.880
stern glance. And we say, Devi gives that Kataksha, Kataksha, Kataksha means she just

327
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:21.360
looks at something and she knows what it is. So slowly I saw whom did she give this Kataksha?

328
00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:29.760
And I saw a man with beard, like a salu and long hair and all that. He was there.

329
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:37.360
I was quite curious and wanted to know what, why did he come? And when I went to ask him if he

330
00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:43.920
wants his realization, he said, no, he just told me like this, leave me alone, sort of.

331
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:51.360
So I said, okay. And then Shri Mataji, she got up and was to go. He came from the opposite direction

332
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.360
towards Shri Mataji. We are ready to intervene in case he does something to Shri Mataji. But when he

333
00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:05.680
came in front of Shri Mataji, he fell down like a coconut tree on her feet. And before he could

334
00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.840
fall down, Shri Mataji just touched his Arna chakra. I don't know with her Arna chakra or

335
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:20.800
with her thumb. And he gave a big sigh of relief like this and he went. And Shri Mataji also,

336
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.720
she went. And then we asked, who was this man? What happened exactly? She said that these are

337
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:36.960
these Hatha Yogis who are coming from the Jandals, from Himalayas. And we know all of us,

338
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:43.440
only Adi Chakti can give realization, nobody else. Only she or her powers, even Sahaja Yogis,

339
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:50.320
because she has given us the power. Now she said that she, he came here to get his realization

340
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:58.960
and they know me much better than you know me. And they, when I put my hand on his Arna chakra,

341
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.560
he got his realization. But these people, when their Kundalini gets stuck up in Arna chakra,

342
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:12.160
it pains like a thousand bees taking, sinking at the same time. It pains very, very painful.

343
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.200
And when I put my finger, his Kundalini rose up and the pain was gone. So he felt relieved

344
00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.880
and he went. And then she said that you Sahaja Yogis, you feel sometimes just some pressure,

345
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:34.880
some tingling, some, how do you say, the burning sensation, because my protection of my Amrela

346
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:41.040
is always there on your head. She said that. And that's why you don't feel that much.

347
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:49.440
How she fulfills our desires.

348
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:59.360
Yeah, just like you were in Raurie, I was young and you were to eat and it was a sort of old table

349
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.520
and I was doing many things and I was the last to come. And there was, everybody had sat on the

350
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:12.960
left hand side only, there was one chair left. So we were sitting to eat and they used to give

351
00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:20.160
chapatis and I like chapatis very much. And they used to give chapatis, everybody knows what chapati

352
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:26.720
is. So they used to give chapati with butter to Shri Mataji and for us without butter. And I like

353
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:34.080
with butter. So they brought four very hot chapatis to Shri Mataji and she just took out one chapati

354
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:43.040
and put it in my plate. I said, no, Shri Mataji said, I know you like them. And I said, okay,

355
00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:50.560
I did not really desire it, but when she puts it, you just eat. And the second thing happened in

356
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:59.600
Solapur, we were there and we were, it was a small room. We were about 10, 15 people. And after going

357
00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.040
out from the room, it was about 10, 30, Shri Mataji said, okay, we will go to bed now.

358
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:11.360
While going out, I just had the thought because the vibrations were so much in this room. I said,

359
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.320
the person who is going to sleep in this room is such a lucky person.

360
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:21.280
I knew somebody sleeping, but I didn't know who. And then we were in another room, we were about

361
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:27.760
to go to bed and that person came, Dhumal uncle was going to sleep there. And he came to us and

362
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.040
he said, do you have enough space? If you don't have, you can come to our room.

363
00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:41.760
And I really jumped, literally jumped and went to sleep in their room. So it was a rectangle room.

364
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:47.280
And on the two sides, Shri Mataji and Uncle Dhumal was sleeping on the bed,

365
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:54.480
parallel at the edge. And I was sitting in the middle, sleeping in the middle on the ground.

366
00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:00.560
And there was a toilet between me and Dhumal uncle. So if Shri Mataji had to go to the toilet,

367
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:07.600
he had to go above me because the room was not big. And when I came to the room,

368
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:14.960
it was all dark and Shri Mataji had already slept. And suddenly, I don't know what time,

369
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.640
I thought that somebody has touched me and stumbled over me, something like that. And I

370
00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:30.000
just got up and I saw that it ran in Shri Mataji's room. And I just got up, the sleep went off.

371
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.920
And Dhumal uncle said Shri Mataji was vomiting the whole night because she was cleaning Solapur.

372
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:45.280
And when she came back, she sat and that time she used to massage her feet very often.

373
00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.640
So we took massage. And I told Shri Mataji of my thought the night before saying that

374
00:46:52.640 --> 00:47:00.400
such good vibrations and the person who is sleeping is so lucky. She said, yes,

375
00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:05.200
because of this thought, I brought you here to sleep here. She said that.

376
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:14.880
And there was also about a sweater in Julia, my mother had lost her sweater.

377
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.720
And we had to go to Delhi, this famous Delhi place. And my mother said,

378
00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:26.080
you buy a sweater from Delhi for me. So this one month ago, I had shown you,

379
00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:32.160
used to go with Shri Mataji for the shopping. And I told him, can you buy one sweater for my mother?

380
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:37.280
He said, okay. So when he came back in the evening, he said, ah, mother liked you very much.

381
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.360
What is he talking about? I told my mother and he taught our mother Shri Mataji.

382
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:52.640
So he bought a sweater for Shri Mataji. And it was a very Kashmiri, just one piece left and all that.

383
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:59.920
And he said, no, no, no, Aurojit has told me to buy a sweater for you. And so she had to take it.

384
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:07.280
And basically what had happened was when I was in Delhi, I was a student and others, they used to

385
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:13.840
give presents to Shri Mataji, like purse and this and that. I said, ah, I don't even know how to

386
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.920
buy a handkerchief. And I was a student. And I said, really? And I said, I don't know how I can

387
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.840
give anything to Shri Mataji. And suddenly, you know, your desire, Shri Mataji took it over.

388
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.800
It was a lovely sweater, Kashmir sweater. They say you can put it through a ring,

389
00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:37.520
you know, that light, but very strong. Yeah. So it was just a desire which Shri Mataji put here.

390
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:43.440
And this also here Mumbai. Is that a different story or is that?

391
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.120
Yeah, this sweater. No, that's, that's it.

392
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.320
And then instances of how she knows without telling her.

393
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.960
Yeah. Because what happened was when I was with Shri Mataji in Nilambar,

394
00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:04.320
I was taking care of all the money part of it as far as the shopping for the day to day activities

395
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:13.040
was concerned. Like we had a cook and I used to go with him to buy, I mean, flowers or vegetables,

396
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:19.520
rice, things that newspaper for Shri Mataji every day. And what happened was Shri Mataji,

397
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:28.640
we had some foreigners, Western people with us, and Shri Mataji was telling me to take them to

398
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:36.080
different places like elephant tuckers, marlin, madalangs, take to the cinema, you know, in Bombay

399
00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:45.840
to entertain them. And it was rather hot and they used to feel thirsty. And we used to go and have

400
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:55.440
some limca and one or two of them, they never had the habit of paying. So, and my restaurant fellow

401
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.680
used to ask me and I used to pay for them always. And my father said, I need to

402
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.160
take money from them because they are like gods, the guests are like gods.

403
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:11.520
So, okay, but I mean, quite a lot of money because for me it was quite a lot, you see,

404
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.640
but every time I used to go, I used to pay. Okay, we pay. And then the next year,

405
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:23.840
1979, all the Westerners when they came, they did not give me any work. And I was quite,

406
00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.640
because when the Westerners come to Bombay, everybody has got a particular job to do.

407
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:36.320
Somebody will welcome them and they'll pour some flowers, that and then I heard that the

408
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:43.280
leader that time had passed a few rumors that when he was in Nillambar, he stole sahaja yoga

409
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:50.880
money. He made some, you know, he took some sahaja yoga money in his pocket. Like laughing,

410
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:57.920
it was just the opposite. So then what happened? We were in Buri Vili and there was a public

411
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:03.440
program and Shrimataji said, all these foreigners, you take them to this place. Which you saw that

412
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:10.560
photo Shrimataji came to this island, which we saw just now this place. And she said,

413
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:19.120
then she said to me, don't spend money on them. And she told everybody, Avdut has spent a lot of

414
00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:27.040
money for you people. Don't allow him to spend money on you. So literally she gave me a clean

415
00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:38.000
sheet without me telling anything. So that is, that is because the money stolen is also another

416
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:48.720
thing is when in 82 Mahakali pooja, my father was taking care of all the organization and that time

417
00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:55.440
he used to have cash. So he told me, Avdut, why don't you just go and count it, how much we have?

418
00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:01.760
So I was counting and there was nobody in the room, but then I counted and kept. And after the

419
00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:09.760
pooja then he came back, the money is gone. All the money is gone. And we were all sahaja yogis

420
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:15.600
there. And suddenly we said, okay, we'll go and take Shrimataji who is in another bungalow.

421
00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:23.040
And we went there and Shrimataji was sleeping. And we just prayed to her in front of our door.

422
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:30.240
We did not disturb her. And when we came back, everybody was asking what happened. We said,

423
00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.200
we have told Shrimataji, she said, don't worry, I will take care of you.

424
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.000
And next day we slept and each morning the money came back. In fact, the sahaja yogi, he had a,

425
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.720
in fact, it seems that he saw me doing that. He knew where the money was and he had a very,

426
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:58.000
I would say, weak moment. And he said, he took the money and then he felt repentant and he knew

427
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.160
that back the money. But in another village, Shrimataji told something about this very

428
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:10.000
indirectly to him. And just we, two or three people could understand that really Shrimataji

429
00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.520
knew what she was saying. And she knew that he had taken the money.

430
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:21.680
Wow. Small instances of her love for her children?

431
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:30.160
So I told you about the tea when she gave me a little bit of tea. And secondly, when

432
00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:38.640
once I was in the, lived in this satnam apartments, it was, I don't know which floor.

433
00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:44.880
I used to always go for taking the tapes, the big tapes, and used to put it on the small

434
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.880
cassettes. And I used to take it to her so that Shrimataji will take it to the UK to listen,

435
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:57.520
being saying jyoti and things like that. And once when we went, I was there and I met Shrimataji

436
00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:03.760
in the lift and I don't know if she put her hand on my head or anyway, she told me, touch her head.

437
00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:10.000
And I touched and she said, Oh, is it hot? I said, yeah, very hot. So she told me from where

438
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.160
I was coming. And then she said, you should always cover your head in the sun. You should not never

439
00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:22.160
go out without covering your head. And I had come about 20, 25, 30 minutes walking the sun.

440
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:31.680
So also when once I wanted to go and I joined a judo. So I was with Shrimataji. I said,

441
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:38.480
I want to go. She said, where do you want to go? I said, I'm doing judo. I said, judo, no, no,

442
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:45.680
judo you should never do. So you never do judo. I said, but I bought this, you know, this special

443
00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:52.000
risk, you know, whatever you call them. So she said, no, no, no. Her special phrase was throw

444
00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:01.040
them in the sea. Samudra se kundi. So I said, I can throw everything I can throw and I will

445
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:09.840
stop being judo. And so she was sometimes quite stern with us, but you could really

446
00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:19.760
realize her love for us. Yeah. She gave us warnings directly, indirectly, so many things

447
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:29.120
that can make another decision. So this carries on to then to how she corrects her children.

448
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:40.320
Yes. So we there was Warren Newman has been knowing he had started Australia. First year

449
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:49.040
when he came he did not get along with anybody. And I mean, not many people. And Shrimataji told

450
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:55.520
me to sit with him in the car to give him mantras, this and that. And I still remember in the

451
00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:08.000
villages to talk and we still have to write for him all the mantras and everything. He went and

452
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.960
came back with 35, 40 Sahaja Yogis Australians, which we had never seen before like that.

453
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:21.040
So many people coming and he had a sort of a liking for us, our family. And when he came back,

454
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:28.880
he brought a flash at that time, the flash was separate from the camera cassettes and the

455
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:35.760
our tape recorder needed a head, the head used to get erased because of the taping and that head we

456
00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:44.080
did not get either in Bombay or in India. And so we told him to bring and he brought. So I told

457
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:52.000
Shrimataji that he did not want to take any money for that. So I told Shrimataji just ask him to

458
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.480
take money. And she was very, very angry with me. And that time she took my ear in her hand,

459
00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.040
she pulled my ear and said, how do you do you are you doing my business?

460
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:08.160
So you guys not for business, throw them everything in the sea. That time, you know,

461
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:15.200
that time is to I put my ears is to not answer back, but argue. I said we can throw everything,

462
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.480
but the head we don't get in India. So okay, head you can keep, but the rest of the things you give

463
00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:26.480
them back to not make any money out of Sahaja Yoga. And it was a big lesson for me.

464
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:36.080
So how she taught not to pay attention to one Yogi?

465
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:45.680
Yes. What happened was there was one Mr. Diwali who is to sort of cure people and all that

466
00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:52.560
and Shrimataji told him not to do that. And she wrote a very beautiful small letter and he took

467
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:59.920
so bad and he went out of Sahaja Yoga. That was in May. Then in August, I had to do my

468
00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:06.160
postgraduate studies in Nagpur. She had come the earlier day and she told me that

469
00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:16.320
you come next day, take a cap record of what her family. I went rather early because I was staying

470
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:23.440
quite far and I had a train at 30. So we had to sort of wake her up once or even twice. And that

471
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:29.440
time she brought up and looked very, very disturbed. And she said that, I said, Shrimataji,

472
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:35.680
I'm really very sorry to have broken you up. So she said, no, no, you did not disturb me. But

473
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:43.360
when these people like Diwali go out of Sahaja Yoga, there is a vortex there and people who

474
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:49.680
are close to him, they get caught up in that vortex and they also go down. For me, it was a

475
00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:56.480
big lesson. However, the Sahaja Yogis, big, small, should not have too much attachments because

476
00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:07.680
we should not be our own gurus. And then she said that he was a very ardent disciple of Shirdi

477
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:15.520
Sai Baba. And she gave me an example. Now Shirdi Sai Baba is not there, I am there. So if you are,

478
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.800
before there's an inspector and then the inspector becomes a commissioner, you should go to the

479
00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.640
commissioner, not to the inspector. And she said, Shirdi Sai Baba is not happy with him and he has

480
00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:35.760
to take him down. So this is something which I wanted to share with you. Wow. We've seen other

481
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:44.960
instances of that. Yeah. And in 1976, Shri Mataji tells it very, very clearly how to meditate in

482
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:52.080
Mumbai. And she, it's in Hindi, but translation is available in Amruta. And she tells about this,

483
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:57.040
that, yeah, those people who have gone out of Sahaja Yoga should not have any relations with them.

484
00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:07.040
And so, yes, examples of what happens when we have attachments for ex-Yogis.

485
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:16.560
So there was a Sahaja Yogi, was Mr. Bhatt and he used to smoke a cigarette chain smoker. Immediately

486
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:26.480
he stopped smoking and then he was quite good. Then there was Mr. Kamath to whom he had come,

487
01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.720
to Sahaja Yoga. He was Kamath for some reason, he was put out of Sahaja Yoga.

488
01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.560
So once Mr. Bhatt wanted to go and just visit him, and he came out, he started smoking. Again,

489
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:43.200
he became a chain smoker. And Shri Mataji worked on him two or three years. And then,

490
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.920
and then really, I remember in this Nilambar, one and a half hour, she worked on him.

491
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.760
And when she used to work, she used to put Sudarshan chakra on his Vishuddhi.

492
01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:00.400
And she used to say, Aham, Aham Sakshat, Shri Krishna, Aham Sakshat, Shri Krishna. And of course,

493
01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.520
he was, he was cured. And then I asked this Mr. Bhatt, what happened? He said,

494
01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:16.400
in the beginning, it was quite good, but later on he had such, such a strong sort of possession,

495
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.760
I don't know, whatever, on his Vishuddhi, which wanted him to smoke. He said, just what happens?

496
01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:28.960
He just made one visit to this ex-Yogi, he was put out of Sahaja Yoga. This is what I wanted to share.

497
01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.560
How did the deities work for Shri Mataji?

498
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:41.840
Yeah, there was one Mr. Angar, who was a civil engineer in the US. And he was

499
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:47.360
rippled well in his life. And he got his realization. When he came to Bombay,

500
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.040
he gave his cards to everybody, his telephone number, everything. When that was written,

501
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:58.960
to give realization, one dollar, to give vibrations, two dollars, something like that.

502
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:06.640
And Shri Mataji wanted him to come to Delhi. And we were in Kalpana Devi's place,

503
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.120
and it was fourth floor. And they were talking and suddenly he said to Shri Mataji,

504
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.000
it's so difficult to contact you. And he said, it's easier to contact the Prime Minister,

505
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.640
Indira Gandhi, than to contact you. Easier to contact her. And we were all rather angry with

506
01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:31.120
him. And this Murya Kalda was there, the leader at that time, he just got up, he's six feet tall,

507
01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.680
he just got up and he said, one more word, Mr. Angar, and I'll throw you out of the window.

508
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:45.120
He really, with such a threatening, then this anger got up and he said, bye bye, Shri Mataji,

509
01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:51.760
and he went away. He said, bye bye, madam, to Shri Mataji, he went away. Then he went to the

510
01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.000
jungles and he found a real guru somewhere in Calicut, in Coorinsa somewhere. And this guru

511
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.520
said, do you know whom you've insulted? You've insulted Adi Shakti. Now you go and ask for her

512
01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:12.560
funniness. And he had long hair, in his repentance he made a bald head, he cut all his hair and he

513
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.280
came to ask for forgiveness to Shri Mataji on the airport. First time he came, the taxis were on

514
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.480
strike, so he could not come on time, Shri Mataji went. Second time, Shri Mataji went just five

515
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:30.720
minutes early and he came. And then Shri Mataji said, because he has insulted me, Yogis, the

516
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.680
Nomanas will see that he will never come in front of me. He will never come in front of me.

517
01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.640
But on the other hand, when she wants to meet someone, how the deities work?

518
01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:54.640
Yeah, so it happened in Greece, the first things in 1999, where Divali Puja and

519
01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:05.280
I danced in front of Shri Mataji. I cannot dance, but really I wanted to dance. We had some folklore,

520
01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:13.360
local dance. Anyway, so there was a toilet. Shri Mataji went to the toilet and everyone used to put

521
01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.960
their shawls. So I said, do I put? I should not put. And in the meantime, everybody put their shawl

522
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:26.240
and Shri Mataji is in the toilet. And I put my shawl, the last one was in front of the toilet.

523
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:32.720
So when Shri Mataji comes, my shawl was the first one. Then the person was tending to Shri Mataji.

524
01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.320
She was right in front of me and she said, Ah, Shri Mataji wants to see you tomorrow morning.

525
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:46.400
I said, okay. I said, if I would not have put the shawl, I would never come here and it's not

526
01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:52.560
possible to give me this message that Shri Mataji wanted to see me. And she said, no,

527
01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:58.480
when Shri Mataji wants to see anybody, it somehow happens. You don't have to do anything and it

528
01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:06.480
happens. Let go and see. And this was the first incident in Kabela also, Shri Mataji was there and

529
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:14.480
my voice was there for some days. And once at night, Shri Mataji said, call Abduk and

530
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.360
somehow they could not contact me. So then weekend afterwards when I went there,

531
01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:28.720
I said, I'm here. But when Shri Mataji calls again, you can come. And we had gone out and

532
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:37.920
when I came back, it was very dark and I was coming up to open the big door from inside

533
01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.320
because there was an aged lady with me. So there's a big staircase in front of the kitchen of Shri

534
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.640
Mataji, you remember. So when you come up, you can open the door from inside. When I came up,

535
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:56.560
I saw on the right hand side in the living room of Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji was sitting

536
01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:03.280
along with her CP and listening to Bim Senjoshi's music. So I just saw, I did not see, I mean,

537
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:11.600
I did not know if she was there. And I saw and I just did namaskar like this. And when she saw,

538
01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:20.640
she said, come, you're coming. And I went and she told, yes, my wife's massage and all that.

539
01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:28.240
And then suddenly, you know, it was June 2003, it was so-called sickness of Shri Mataji. So

540
01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:36.000
I suddenly said, Mother, please let me go to Marathi. And she said, Oh, I am well.

541
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:44.800
I said, then it's alright for me. Then she said a word in the kitchen. She said, tell yogis not to

542
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:52.080
worry about my health. I'm working on something. So this is something lesson which I learned that

543
01:06:52.080 --> 01:07:00.640
whatever happens, as I told you, you know, all these stories about Shri Mataji, who was there,

544
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:06.800
who was not there, everything is planned, every single thing is planned. I learned from that.

545
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:14.160
Because if a small country, some president is going to another country, his bodyguards,

546
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:22.240
spies, everybody go there to, to, to, you know, do the preparation work. So if Adi Shakti is coming

547
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:30.000
on the ground, on the earth, everything is taken care of. Okay. So you should not feel that way.

548
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.160
And Shri Mataji has talked about it in 88th, I think, so Sastrara Devoja. So I mean,

549
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:42.160
this is something which I learned. And the Greece incident?

550
01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.040
Yeah, Greece was this incident about Shaul.

551
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.600
And how she's in, how she's present in the collective?

552
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.680
We were in Raurie and we were four of us when Suryogi was taking care of our organisation

553
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:06.000
with Raul Bhai, Srimataji and myself. And Srimataji, and there were some Suryogis from abroad,

554
01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:13.520
about 40, 50, staying about, I don't know, something like 30 kilometres. And Srimataji

555
01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.280
told this person, bring them here, bring them here. And three, four times he, she told,

556
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.000
and he did not sort of budge. And they did not come. And the next day, we learned that

557
01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:31.600
they were expecting Srimataji to come there. And they were thinking that they will be a puja of

558
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:39.200
Srimataji. That time there were no mobiles. So then they did not come. They did a Nirakara puja.

559
01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:48.480
And so I feel that Srimataji was physically with us, but spiritually she was with them.

560
01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.200
So she's always with the collective, even if physically we are there.

561
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:58.720
It's not, it's not, she's always in the collective.

562
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.360
How her chakras worked during a public programme?

563
01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.800
So in Raurie, in Bombay, when we had these public programmes,

564
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:17.040
once she told how to just come and put your hand on my Adnya back, there was a public programme.

565
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:27.040
When I put my hand, it was so much, it was moving like a generator. And at times I was so difficult

566
01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:33.920
to put my hand because it was throwing it outside. I could feel her back Adnya working so strongly.

567
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.240
And she wanted, because that time we were not taking vibrations more so.

568
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:48.320
So I had to put the hand just to tell you that this is how Srimataji works during all

569
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.600
public programmes, all her chakras work, everything is inside a lot of things going on.

570
01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:01.920
An instance of how powerful her attention is?

571
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.880
We were in this place in Delhi and she had a ear pain and it was quite painful.

572
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:20.480
And Srimataji was literally suffering in pain and Raul Bhaikal does, me and another yogi

573
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.480
in the afternoon, that time used to put fingers in the ears, oil and everything.

574
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:31.840
And still it was not working out and I was rather worried. And it's six-thirty of years to have a

575
01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.280
public programme and six-twenty-five somebody said, there's a lot of people coming, they've

576
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:43.280
gathered, the public programme is there. And Srimataji, in five minutes she just dressed up

577
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:49.600
and she came out. From six-thirty to eleven, eleven-thirty she gave the talk, everything,

578
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:58.880
and not a single sign of pain. And I was really surprised. I said whether the pain went away,

579
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:06.240
which I doubt, it was rather quite heavy, or it was not pain in me. So after a year or two I had

580
01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:12.560
the opportunity to ask Srimataji. And Srimati said, I remember that pain, it was there, but

581
01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.800
when I put my attention on Sahaja Yogi's, when I don't put my attention on the pain, the pain does

582
01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:27.120
not exist for me. So when her attention is not there on somewhere, that thing doesn't,

583
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.440
is not, the same thing as the umbrella business will be sadhu, she told.

584
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.800
And first class, your first class?

585
01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:45.040
It was the same thing that I was trying for my first class and I just missed some marks,

586
01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.360
and that I used to write to Srimataji in the AUG state Surya address, a lot of letters. So I wrote

587
01:11:51.360 --> 01:12:00.240
to her that I just missed my first class and she just put her attention on what happened and here

588
01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.720
somehow to make the story short I got my first class. Just she put attention, when she came here

589
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:13.840
she said, she told us that when I got your letter I just put my attention and after some days

590
01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:24.560
how she got the letter that I got my first class. And she told to tell the story in a lot of villages,

591
01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.120
to the villagers how it happens. So she did it for you but she also did it for the whole

592
01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.600
world in a way. Yeah, yeah, but to tell the experiences. Yes, exactly. To the new people,

593
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:47.280
how you can help and you know. So importance of putting letters on her feet?

594
01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:54.080
It was in 1987 in Paris, at that time she had put out a letter from Bombay and she said that

595
01:12:54.080 --> 01:13:01.360
he was using foul language, bad words. And she told, she said, she told my father,

596
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:07.280
why didn't you tell me that he was using bad language? And he said,

597
01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.720
yes I used to tell you Srimataji but I used to write it and put it on your feet and Srimataji

598
01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:23.280
told me all this just to insist that when we have any problem really

599
01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.960
we can put on Srimataji's feet. She will take her time to take to solve it, not insist on that it

600
01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:38.400
should be solved immediately. But whatever really we feel that like for example divisions in

601
01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:42.480
Sahaja Yoga, this and that. So just put on Srimataji's feet and just forget about it.

602
01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.960
And later on just to tell you that I used to put letters on her feet and then

603
01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:59.760
bury them or put in the reverse and be like that. And once I forgot and four years later I

604
01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:06.640
got that letter because I lost that letter. The letter I had asked Srimataji, I said,

605
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.400
the letter I had asked Srimataji that I should feel the joy in my meditation

606
01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:15.280
and I should not feel angry. I was feeling very angry. I used to get angry very fast

607
01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:22.240
and these two wounds she had given me in these four years. So from that time I really,

608
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:30.320
you know, I do that. So can I just ask, so what do you do with the letters after you take? No,

609
01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:38.720
I put it in the river or you can put it in a burry or yeah so do like that.

610
01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:47.520
So and how Srimachi saw many things in advance? Like for example Sahaja marriage started in 78

611
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:53.440
which I told you and even before that three four years she was talking about Sahaja marriages

612
01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:02.720
between Sir Yogi. She said she will get them married and Ganapati Puli also started in December

613
01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:09.920
85 but before that three four years Srimataji was talking about Ganapati Puli. Now just to tell you

614
01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:19.840
that how she sees things in the future like in Diwali Puja 2003 it's not a very big talk. It's a

615
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.640
small talk of five ten minutes. Srimati said Sahaja Yogi should not worry about their

616
01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:31.440
small little problems. Their destiny will work it out and then she said that when it will come

617
01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:38.000
you'll remember that I've said it. I'm saying it now but your destiny will work out. So all these

618
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.680
like jobs is that all this is not your job. Your destiny will work it out and

619
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.160
many many things come in my head what Srimati said. One of the things in Diwali Puja 85 Srimati said

620
01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:01.760
nobody can destroy Sahaja Yoga from outside only from inside. Now this is something happening

621
01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:11.280
especially here. So all those things Srimatiji gives us in Mahalakshmi Puja 86 in Belgium she told

622
01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:16.000
that all the money from the West will go and the third world countries will get

623
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:23.040
the money. Now you will see that China, India they are having much more money than the West.

624
01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.680
All the small things Srimati just told which you did not tell your family. Yes yes.

625
01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.680
And how she helped your worldly mother to pass away smoothly?

626
01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.920
Yeah so it was a very again a very strong experience for me because

627
01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.400
my sister got married in 83 and she was with Srimati in her car and all that and

628
01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:59.760
myself and my father we were on two buses with the foreigners and my my mother Srimati said we

629
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:08.560
keep her at home don't take her with you because she has got some problems. In 83 and 84 January

630
01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:16.640
suddenly we got a message from from the tour at night and she said Srimati you want Mr and Mrs

631
01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:25.360
5 to come next day to the or you should join the tour immediately. So both of them they went and

632
01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:32.560
my Srimati told my mother you be on the tour but never come physically in front of me. Don't

633
01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:39.280
show me your discount. Don't come in front of me. Okay everything fine. And then in February we had

634
01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:48.960
these marriages and we had Srimati Puja in Birli and everybody was putting the halbi on Srimati's

635
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:57.600
feet and my mother also came because she wanted to put and Srimati was very very angry on her

636
01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:05.840
and my mother felt so bad she I mean she was really feeling very bad and I said you see

637
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.600
last year she said not to go on the tour this year she said go on the tour there is some reason you

638
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:19.920
don't know I don't know. And then in March 21st March about the puja I went and asked Srimati

639
01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:28.800
whether the parents can go to England because my sister was carrying a baby and whether they can go

640
01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:38.400
and my mother Srimati said immediately no because your mother is sick my mother was not sick and

641
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:47.040
then again used to ask question like okay then if my father can go alone and then Srimati said

642
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:55.200
okay let her food soak my mother let her food soak because at the moment she's not food soaking and

643
01:18:55.200 --> 01:19:00.480
that was true she was very regular in food soaking but 15-20 days she had not food soaked

644
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:07.040
said she would like to see her granddaughter and let her go and then on the 6th of April the first

645
01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:12.720
time my mother could not sleep the whole night and she was breathing like anything we didn't know

646
01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:20.000
what was happening we broke down our days there doctor whatever everything happened and on the

647
01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:27.760
14th whatever it's Monday we the doctor said we should take her to the hospital to take her

648
01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:34.400
heart x-ray and the x-ray showed that she had some problem the ventricles and something like that

649
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.680
and he gave the right medicine and really in the evening she after about one and a half months

650
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:46.720
she first time she ate something she lost a lot of but at night she came in her dream and she

651
01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:53.360
might as you told her she came as a lakshmi and she might have told her that you put everything

652
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.720
on my lotus feet don't worry about your family your husband your children nothing just put

653
01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.520
everything at my lotus feet my mother was so happy that she came

654
01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:11.840
like that and she told us next day and we thought okay in two three years she'll go back come back

655
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:19.680
home Tuesday night again she came and she said you do you remember what I told last night said yes

656
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:28.080
I remember so she again and then the next day night my mother expired because the morning and

657
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:34.640
then she sent us a beautiful letter to my father saying that she tried to warn us she tried to work

658
01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.400
on her so that everything goes on well and

659
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:51.200
she helped to go past him peacefully because basically when the person dies early in the life

660
01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:00.400
they they have that desire behind she prepared her to prepare her for her last surgery

661
01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:07.040
sorry I was a bit bored because I could literally see that because you're in the

662
01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:13.920
hospital trying to contact she said because you could not contact me I couldn't know that

663
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:21.760
nothing can be done and God's will has to be restored in the letter she had written

664
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:31.760
I still have that so and when your father passed away no my father passed away in may 80

665
01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:46.560
uh may 94 and um he had uh in February 94 uh he had um made his bill and in the building he wrote

666
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.120
that everything to be given to sajibah he had lots of cassettes photo books everything and we had a

667
01:21:53.120 --> 01:22:00.960
flat in Mumbai the Urmila flat and uh he said anything other things can be you know given to

668
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:07.280
somebody else but this flat has to be given to sajibah and he had made an executor of the bill

669
01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:15.680
and what happened was uh I took this will to shrimataji in kavila in adishakti and eco

670
01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:24.160
and shrimataji was uh reading this will and I could literally see the ears coming out of eyes

671
01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:31.120
I can see see them she was crying and she said he has given everything for sajibah and she said

672
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:37.840
your father was very astute as far as money was concerned because by profession he was an engineer

673
01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:46.400
but uh after his retirement he dedicated fully when I came here um fully for sajibah and used

674
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:53.520
to take the accounts uh of sajibah and he was sort of a right-hand man of baba mama was a chartered

675
01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:59.920
accountant so and she said shrimataji said you would not give even a single penny to anybody if

676
01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:07.600
it does not have the bills see so and she said that uh so many people they made uh

677
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:13.440
money out of sajibah very few people they not only kept the money but raised them and she said your

678
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:20.400
father was or nothing it was a very big certificate for for us and she said uh she was telling

679
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:32.400
me may god bless you may god bless you and uh then uh this was um

680
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:40.800
then she said that uh in february she your father uh could feel his death coming and that's why he

681
01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:50.880
wrote the the bill and what happened was 1999 till 1999 the flat was not transferred to to sajibah

682
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.600
and the executor had not done anything shrimati was very angry with him

683
01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.880
and she immediately changed him and made harijjala he must be knowing so he was a leader of bombay

684
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.480
at that time as the executor of the week and she wrote it on a paper and signed i have still got

685
01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:15.680
that letter with me so and then it was done and later on i could meet her and shrimati said

686
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:26.880
uh she was very you know and sort of grateful because till 17 to 99 we uh we did not have any

687
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:34.400
place for sajibah official which we can say it is ours in bombay and then this flat was uh put

688
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:43.040
in sajibah since 1999 till about even recently because everything was it was official office

689
01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.920
what shrimati wanted and everybody it was their place and even recently they wanted to

690
01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:57.840
to sell this place to buy another one they lead in bombay people opposed and uh

691
01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.560
finally they did not sell this place but they bought another one

692
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.800
and this place is still there it's called urmila yeah so these are some of the

693
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:17.040
some of the uh experiences which i had with shrimati i'm sorry did uh i must miss when you

694
01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:22.640
said shimashi talked about your father taking a birth again yeah yeah that's why i forgot she

695
01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:29.920
said that your father will um she said uh when i called her it was on monday and when i called her

696
01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:38.400
and when i called her um yeah she might have is uh afterwards she took his atma in her hand

697
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.680
and he said physically i'm tired now let me go i will come back i'll come back and she said he

698
01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:58.320
will come between you this between the surgeries yeah thank you thank you it was sorry i was a bit

699
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:06.880
moved because uh shrimati literally got brought brought me up because my mother passed away i was

700
01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:19.600
27 and later on even before 2011 and after 2011 she every single moment she was there

701
