00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.485
Happy Christmas to you all.
May God Bless You.

00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:01.206
The birth of Christ is celebrated all over
the world,

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:09.912
and it’s nice that we are celebrating here
at Ganapatipule His birth.

00:01:10.113 --> 00:01:14.727
As you know very well in Sahaja Yoga,
we have realised

00:01:14.928 --> 00:01:17.962
that the principle of Christ was
Shri Ganesha.

00:01:18.163 --> 00:01:21.921
So this is the right place to celebrate
the Christmas

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:29.519
and the Birth of Christ is the - absolutely
coincides today

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.963
and I am very happy that you have chosen
Ganapatipule for that.

00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:42.878
Now as you know very well, that Ganesha’s
principle became

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.864
the principle of Christ at the Agnya
Chakra.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:53.010
And that’s a very important centre that
we have within ourselves

00:01:53.211 --> 00:02:01.963
which has given us a new dimension
to our personality,

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:08.970
that we can resurrect ourselves as Christ
resurrected Himself;

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:14.421
so the message of His life is resurrection.

00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:22.795
So from His birth He got His resurrection
done, in the same way

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:31.098
you are born again when you get your
Resurrection, or you become Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.545
On the same principle it works.

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:43.041
But He had to physically pass through
all the penance,

00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:47.843
as we say that He died for us, for our
sins;

00:02:48.044 --> 00:02:55.222
but now as He has done that for us,
the Agnya Chakra is absolutely

00:02:55.423 --> 00:02:59.985
at our command, that we can open it out
whenever we like,

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:07.062
if we are Sahaja Yogis, and we can
enlighten that Chakra also.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.165
This is the Chakra always caught up
by people

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:17.765
who try talk about Christ, to say things
about Christ,

00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:22.883
or to profess that they have Christ
in their pockets,

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:25.941
when they have no connection with Christ.

00:03:26.142 --> 00:03:28.651
Now, for this Christ has very clearly said,

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:33.068
that, “You will be calling me Christ,
Christ, and I won’t recognise you”.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.699
There are so many people of this kind,
and that’s why

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.995
the celebration of Christ’s Birth by them
is just a festival

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:46.781
but has no deeper significance.
But for Sahaja Yogis

00:03:46.982 --> 00:03:53.564
it’s a very great happening, because
His birth

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:56.768
has brought such a great Incarnation
on this earth

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:05.865
and by that we could achieve our
Realisation because He is at the gate.

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:15.824
So, today is the day of thankfulness
for Christ’s Advent on this earth,

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:22.290
and we have to see that as He is our
eldest brother,

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:28.723
we can say, He is our leader, we have
to follow His footsteps;

00:04:28.924 --> 00:04:34.526
in our Resurrection, we have to show
that we have imbibed

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:40.603
the qualities which are Christ-like,

00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:48.004
illuminating the whole Universe with
our enlightened lives.

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:52.608
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis
to understand that

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:58.244
when we are celebrating today the birth
of Christ, we stand for something

00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:07.345
very much beautiful, pure and glorious.

00:05:07.532 --> 00:05:14.965
Christ’s life is a - symbolically can be
called

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:26.354
as the symbol of purity and holiness,
He was purity and holiness.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:33.258
When we talk of purity we may think
about outside purity,

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:38.416
or maybe the purity of our writings
or talking,

00:05:38.617 --> 00:05:43.928
or maybe we are very sophisticated, or we
talk very sweetly, or we are very kind;

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:55.718
but Christ was pure in the sense that
He was nothing but purity.

00:05:56.743 --> 00:06:02.634
And He went to this extent of purity,
that He said that,

00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:09.503
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,
that your eyes have to be pure.

00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:15.819
Even up to the eyes. He said: “Thou
shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.458
So, the lust and greed has to disappear
from our personality

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.528
if we have to follow Christ, if we have
to understand

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.088
what an incarnation of holiness He was.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.793
Holiness is very important today, when
in this ghor Kali Yuga

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:39.265
you find all kinds of horrible things
happening.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:44.970
If you believe in holiness, in your
chastity and in your purity,

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:51.254
then your morality is within yourself,
is not outside.

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:53.837
Whatever people may say about Christ today,

00:06:54.038 --> 00:07:00.518
but you know as Sahaja Yogis that He was
purest of pure.

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:06.749
In the same way, we should try to keep
our purity above everything else.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.648
The most important thing for us to be
pure people:

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:16.684
pure from heart, pure in our morality,
pure in our thinking

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:21.642
and pure in our rapport that we have
with others.

00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:24.960
Not just a show, not just artificiality,

00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.805
but from within we should feel that
oneness,

00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:33.607
that understanding that we are all
Sahaja Yogis,

00:07:33.807 --> 00:07:37.802
born of a Mother, and we all have to love
each other.

00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:41.294
That is the greatest blessings you could
give to Me

00:07:41.495 --> 00:07:45.906
and also the greatest joy for Christ,
to see that all of you

00:07:46.107 --> 00:07:52.778
are absolutely in unison and in complete
accord with each other.

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:58.498
This is something one has to understand,
that He also said to His disciples that,

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:04.195
“The greatest pleasure for me is to see
you all together in one unison.”

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:08.962
But now the collective consciousness is
within your consciousness,

00:08:09.163 --> 00:08:11.663
you can feel the collectivity within
yourself;

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:15.924
so it should be very easy for you to become
one with each other,

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:22.333
to understand each other, just like a part
and parcel of one being.

00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:27.171
So I wish you all A Very Happy Christmas
and let us start this New year

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:32.814
with the full idea that we have to have
that dedication of Christ,

00:08:33.015 --> 00:08:37.381
that understanding of Christ, how He
dedicated His life,

00:08:37.582 --> 00:08:44.436
which was very short, for the establishment
of purity in this world.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.244
If the Sahaja Yogis do not have that
personality,

00:08:50.445 --> 00:08:52.610
they cannot establish Sahaja Yoga anywhere.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.211
So the first and foremost thing we have
to aspire is purity,

00:08:57.412 --> 00:09:01.409
as you know very well that Adi Shakti first
created Shri Ganesha

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.440
who is the symbol of purity.

00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:08.914
So today we have to take a vow, that
henceforth

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:14.554
we are going to follow a life of complete
purity and detachment.

00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:18.058
That’s not so difficult if you understand
Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:23.443
If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy
to purify yourself.

00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:25.886
I am so very happy you all could come here.

00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:32.866
Lots of inconveniences are there, but
as you being the saints now,

00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:38.014
don’t complain anything and you are
enjoying whatever is there,

00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:45.635
the pure air of this place and the purity
of nature that is around us.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:54.613
Let us also meditate and emit, manifest

00:09:54.814 --> 00:09:58.875
that beautiful thing that is within us
which is the Spirit.

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:04.009
And I am sure all this place will be
vibrant very soon,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.001
as it is I could feel the vibrations from
a very long distance when I came.

00:10:09.202 --> 00:10:11.559
May God bless you all.
