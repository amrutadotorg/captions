04:28.048 --> 04:37.123
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

04:38.076 --> 04:45.071
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

04:45.272 --> 04:48.796
for all the humanity.

04:48.997 --> 04:55.312
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

04:55.512 --> 05:00.599
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

05:00.800 --> 05:06.020
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

05:10.239 --> 05:14.078
When this happened

05:17.906 --> 05:23.582
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

05:23.783 --> 05:29.235
because no one would understand Me,

05:29.436 --> 05:36.953
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

05:37.153 --> 05:42.772
to say something about Sahasrara.

05:44.562 --> 05:54.611
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

05:54.812 --> 06:03.202
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

06:03.403 --> 06:09.463
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

06:10.836 --> 06:19.622
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

06:22.524 --> 06:31.933
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

06:32.777 --> 06:36.948
and unless and until there are many lights,

06:37.149 --> 06:44.025
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.630
It is a human error, also, all the time,

06:49.883 --> 06:57.077
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

06:57.277 --> 07:02.409
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

07:02.610 --> 07:06.097
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

07:06.298 --> 07:11.909
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

07:12.798 --> 07:17.757
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

07:17.957 --> 07:24.268
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

07:24.469 --> 07:28.756
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

07:29.783 --> 07:36.783
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

07:36.984 --> 07:41.552
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

07:41.753 --> 07:49.141
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

07:49.341 --> 07:58.408
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

07:58.609 --> 08:04.777
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

08:04.977 --> 08:11.871
Human level is moving on another plane

08:12.072 --> 08:17.104
and it has to come up to a higher plane

08:17.304 --> 08:23.639
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

08:25.176 --> 08:30.128
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

08:30.395 --> 08:36.941
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

08:37.359 --> 08:40.744
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

08:40.945 --> 08:44.285
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

08:44.486 --> 08:50.670
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

08:53.179 --> 09:02.211
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

09:02.412 --> 09:09.620
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

09:09.821 --> 09:15.925
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

09:16.126 --> 09:20.232
their fondness for things may be different,

09:20.433 --> 09:26.287
but inside they are all very beautiful.

09:28.039 --> 09:33.711
And this I found out, one after another.

09:33.912 --> 09:38.826
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

09:39.027 --> 09:46.309
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

09:47.227 --> 09:50.779
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

09:50.980 --> 09:54.017
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

09:54.218 --> 10:01.283
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

10:03.110 --> 10:10.985
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

10:12.600 --> 10:19.452
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

10:19.652 --> 10:24.894
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

10:25.094 --> 10:32.539
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

10:32.739 --> 10:40.993
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

10:41.192 --> 10:45.628
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

10:45.829 --> 10:49.015
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

10:49.216 --> 10:53.956
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

10:54.201 --> 10:59.469
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

11:00.485 --> 11:08.218
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

11:08.623 --> 11:17.497
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

11:20.363 --> 11:29.725
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

11:29.924 --> 11:37.042
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

11:37.509 --> 11:46.752
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

11:47.268 --> 11:58.657
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

11:59.438 --> 12:06.295
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

12:06.495 --> 12:11.564
which gave them sense of reality,

12:11.764 --> 12:18.242
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

12:19.841 --> 12:26.125
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

12:26.325 --> 12:32.708
I didn't say that it took Me long,

12:32.907 --> 12:37.375
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

12:37.576 --> 12:41.512
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

12:41.713 --> 12:48.378
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

12:48.579 --> 12:55.177
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

12:55.378 --> 13:00.026
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

13:00.226 --> 13:02.993
but only I felt that from human level

13:03.193 --> 13:09.999
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

13:10.198 --> 13:15.329
then some of that still lingers on,

13:15.529 --> 13:21.226
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

13:21.427 --> 13:28.918
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

13:29.497 --> 13:38.362
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

13:38.562 --> 13:42.971
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

13:43.171 --> 13:49.778
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

13:49.979 --> 13:55.586
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

13:55.786 --> 14:04.272
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

14:05.419 --> 14:11.240
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

14:11.440 --> 14:18.333
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

14:21.363 --> 14:28.734
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

14:28.934 --> 14:33.450
maybe it's your own understanding.

14:33.651 --> 14:40.201
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

14:40.401 --> 14:46.305
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

14:46.506 --> 14:51.468
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

14:51.669 --> 14:56.381
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

14:56.582 --> 15:02.810
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

15:03.010 --> 15:05.327
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

15:05.527 --> 15:10.994
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

15:11.194 --> 15:20.615
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

15:20.815 --> 15:28.327
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

15:29.602 --> 15:35.353
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

15:51.363 --> 15:57.166
When you feel responsible, you must know

15:57.367 --> 16:03.276
that you are not in charge, one thing.

16:03.485 --> 16:12.399
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

16:12.788 --> 16:22.572
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

16:24.418 --> 16:29.073
So to think that you are doing anything

16:29.273 --> 16:34.589
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

16:34.787 --> 16:40.231
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

16:40.432 --> 16:45.345
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

16:46.095 --> 16:49.852
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

16:50.052 --> 16:56.649
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

16:57.044 --> 17:04.753
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

17:04.970 --> 17:10.582
this great tree of spirituality within you.

17:10.818 --> 17:20.246
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

17:20.455 --> 17:28.869
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

17:29.983 --> 17:38.341
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

17:40.479 --> 17:44.619
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

17:44.820 --> 17:50.962
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

17:51.163 --> 17:54.639
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

17:54.839 --> 17:57.875
You are testing yourself, and now must know

17:58.075 --> 18:03.161
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

18:05.936 --> 18:09.431
where very few have entered.

18:19.649 --> 18:23.881
And there in that garden, when you enter,

18:24.238 --> 18:34.935
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

18:36.733 --> 18:42.682
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

18:43.340 --> 18:51.413
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

18:51.613 --> 18:55.848
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

18:56.048 --> 19:00.036
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

19:00.237 --> 19:06.404
that friendship, without any expectation.

19:07.559 --> 19:10.875
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

19:11.075 --> 19:16.685
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

19:16.885 --> 19:22.166
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

19:23.309 --> 19:28.030
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

19:28.230 --> 19:32.438
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

19:32.638 --> 19:38.200
or he's not doing much in life.

19:47.101 --> 19:50.968
This integration, this oneness,

19:51.169 --> 19:55.715
this feeling of identification with others

19:55.916 --> 20:02.207
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

20:05.064 --> 20:11.245
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

20:12.288 --> 20:17.259
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

20:17.459 --> 20:22.847
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

20:23.047 --> 20:28.247
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

20:28.479 --> 20:33.176
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

20:33.377 --> 20:38.757
but I've seen how it happens.

20:40.301 --> 20:47.416
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

20:47.616 --> 20:53.465
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

20:55.302 --> 20:57.999
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

20:58.199 --> 21:05.033
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

21:05.234 --> 21:09.709
Here then, you become absolutely humble

21:10.111 --> 21:14.428
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

21:15.888 --> 21:19.886
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

21:20.085 --> 21:24.999
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

21:26.051 --> 21:34.008
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

21:35.715 --> 21:40.824
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

21:41.753 --> 21:48.913
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

21:49.114 --> 21:54.981
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

21:55.421 --> 22:00.531
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

22:03.603 --> 22:08.717
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

22:09.150 --> 22:12.823
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

22:15.066 --> 22:25.019
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

22:25.728 --> 22:30.448
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

22:30.649 --> 22:34.707
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

22:37.378 --> 22:41.417
Such a flexible temperament you developed

22:41.618 --> 22:46.372
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

22:46.609 --> 22:51.222
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

22:51.423 --> 22:56.072
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

22:56.271 --> 23:03.273
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

23:03.474 --> 23:11.180
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

23:13.252 --> 23:19.104
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

23:19.305 --> 23:25.624
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

23:25.825 --> 23:30.222
to do this great job, to do that.

23:36.268 --> 23:45.281
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

23:46.380 --> 23:50.924
nor you should think that you are very
small.

23:52.881 --> 24:01.592
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

24:01.792 --> 24:10.884
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

24:11.084 --> 24:15.451
It could expand into anything,

24:16.525 --> 24:21.972
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

24:23.072 --> 24:31.039
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

24:32.238 --> 24:38.338
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

24:38.538 --> 24:44.563
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

24:44.763 --> 24:49.769
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

24:50.024 --> 24:56.715
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

24:58.179 --> 25:05.152
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

25:05.353 --> 25:11.163
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

25:11.362 --> 25:18.904
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

25:20.287 --> 25:23.425
I'll give you an example.

25:24.546 --> 25:31.014
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

25:31.215 --> 25:36.333
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

25:36.533 --> 25:40.499
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

25:40.699 --> 25:47.107
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

25:47.308 --> 25:52.109
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

25:53.418 --> 25:59.259
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

25:59.460 --> 26:03.192
and she couldn't move her fingers.

26:03.713 --> 26:08.817
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

26:09.017 --> 26:14.020
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

26:14.220 --> 26:18.817
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

26:19.017 --> 26:23.304
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

26:25.941 --> 26:28.636
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

26:28.837 --> 26:32.133
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

26:32.334 --> 26:34.997
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

26:35.197 --> 26:37.270
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

26:37.471 --> 26:40.935
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

26:41.213 --> 26:46.057
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

26:46.257 --> 26:49.833
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

26:50.034 --> 26:51.773
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

26:51.974 --> 26:56.890
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

26:57.090 --> 27:01.871
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

27:04.708 --> 27:07.766
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

27:07.967 --> 27:13.773
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

27:13.974 --> 27:18.255
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

27:18.454 --> 27:20.815
if you have to do that, it will work out.

27:20.976 --> 27:25.554
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

27:26.084 --> 27:29.480
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

27:29.681 --> 27:32.462
and who is not a realized soul.

27:32.662 --> 27:37.733
A realized soul person is not bothered

27:37.934 --> 27:45.100
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

27:46.369 --> 27:49.012
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

27:49.213 --> 27:55.475
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

27:59.911 --> 28:03.096
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

28:03.296 --> 28:07.818
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

28:08.019 --> 28:11.642
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

28:11.843 --> 28:14.731
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

28:14.932 --> 28:20.860
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

28:21.173 --> 28:25.356
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

28:25.557 --> 28:28.556
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

28:28.757 --> 28:33.583
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

28:33.783 --> 28:37.431
That you can live under any circumstances

28:37.631 --> 28:44.309
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

28:45.926 --> 28:51.220
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

28:54.407 --> 29:00.343
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

29:00.544 --> 29:03.497
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

29:03.697 --> 29:06.509
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

29:06.709 --> 29:10.579
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

29:10.779 --> 29:18.167
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

29:18.734 --> 29:23.338
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

29:23.538 --> 29:29.549
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

29:29.749 --> 29:38.593
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

29:39.064 --> 29:44.253
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

29:44.453 --> 29:50.588
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

29:50.982 --> 29:57.659
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

29:57.859 --> 30:06.048
If it can, it will, and also it tries

30:06.249 --> 30:14.688
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

30:15.311 --> 30:20.947
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

30:21.148 --> 30:26.325
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

30:27.134 --> 30:32.975
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

30:33.309 --> 30:41.943
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

30:44.376 --> 30:52.413
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

30:52.614 --> 30:58.845
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

30:59.046 --> 31:03.273
this Divine power, they cannot.

31:04.225 --> 31:08.626
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

31:08.827 --> 31:16.553
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

31:16.754 --> 31:22.915
and now you are just like great citizens

31:23.115 --> 31:30.435
of the great realm of divinity.

31:30.820 --> 31:37.031
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

31:37.999 --> 31:45.377
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

31:45.943 --> 31:55.858
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

31:56.358 --> 32:04.572
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

32:04.772 --> 32:10.556
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

32:10.756 --> 32:18.474
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

32:19.006 --> 32:25.130
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

32:25.311 --> 32:30.389
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

32:30.589 --> 32:35.850
But it never means that you should give up,

32:36.050 --> 32:41.614
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

32:41.815 --> 32:49.850
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

32:50.305 --> 32:54.331
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

32:54.531 --> 33:01.528
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

33:01.728 --> 33:07.804
or I do not earnestly want anything.

33:09.785 --> 33:14.439
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

33:15.303 --> 33:21.501
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

33:21.762 --> 33:27.011
You people are very differently made.

33:27.212 --> 33:30.485
Because you have achieved something.

33:40.710 --> 33:47.367
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

33:48.315 --> 33:51.083
Because you’ve achieved something,

33:51.284 --> 33:58.107
you know how you were and what you are now.

34:01.082 --> 34:09.167
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

34:10.544 --> 34:15.172
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

34:15.373 --> 34:20.483
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

34:20.684 --> 34:26.107
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

34:26.308 --> 34:34.698
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

34:35.182 --> 34:41.641
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

34:41.841 --> 34:47.299
You have crossed the bondage and now

34:47.500 --> 34:51.836
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

34:53.665 --> 35:00.594
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

35:00.794 --> 35:09.634
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

35:09.835 --> 35:13.644
then this lotus opens like this.

35:14.799 --> 35:19.822
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

35:21.517 --> 35:26.628
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

35:26.829 --> 35:33.278
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

35:33.479 --> 35:39.514
just like these, and they look like flames.

35:39.714 --> 35:46.329
But these flames are not with any heat,

35:46.529 --> 35:51.747
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

35:51.947 --> 35:59.246
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

36:00.938 --> 36:06.282
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

36:06.663 --> 36:14.156
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

36:16.477 --> 36:19.441
This is what has happened to you.

36:21.162 --> 36:26.847
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

36:29.265 --> 36:34.652
and there where we fail, sometimes,

36:34.946 --> 36:41.912
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

36:43.039 --> 36:50.897
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

36:51.098 --> 36:54.715
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

36:54.916 --> 37:03.838
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

37:09.533 --> 37:12.471
So you have to be,

37:20.364 --> 37:23.345
you have to be on the guard,

37:25.207 --> 37:30.917
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

37:32.322 --> 37:37.706
The first is ego, which how to attack,

37:37.907 --> 37:43.021
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

37:43.625 --> 37:46.803
that's the only vehicle.

37:51.096 --> 37:56.590
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

37:56.791 --> 38:01.313
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

38:03.269 --> 38:08.511
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

38:09.400 --> 38:15.434
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

38:17.732 --> 38:20.367
Why are you angry?

38:21.407 --> 38:26.494
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

38:26.695 --> 38:29.936
or to check someone? Why?

38:30.450 --> 38:33.219
The mind will not answer.

38:36.071 --> 38:39.436
The simple thing, if you can do,

38:39.637 --> 38:45.353
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

38:46.337 --> 38:52.930
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

38:55.299 --> 38:58.787
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

38:58.987 --> 39:02.114
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

39:02.315 --> 39:07.937
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

39:10.314 --> 39:14.115
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

39:14.316 --> 39:19.020
just know that you have to love that person.

39:21.754 --> 39:25.789
Now, how will you love that person?

39:25.989 --> 39:33.382
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

39:33.583 --> 39:38.973
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

39:40.977 --> 39:46.113
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

39:46.724 --> 39:52.284
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

39:52.484 --> 39:56.187
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

39:56.388 --> 40:00.597
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

40:00.813 --> 40:05.729
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

40:05.983 --> 40:08.693
Very amusing.

40:11.388 --> 40:15.920
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

40:16.120 --> 40:23.185
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

40:23.386 --> 40:27.173
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

40:27.374 --> 40:30.177
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

40:30.345 --> 40:31.457
makes no difference.

40:31.658 --> 40:36.901
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

40:37.102 --> 40:43.977
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

40:45.878 --> 40:49.409
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

40:49.610 --> 40:54.865
and that's the only source of her life,

40:55.066 --> 40:59.192
then I can understand why she is so upset.

41:05.372 --> 41:08.237
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

41:08.438 --> 41:12.557
very easily, it's not difficult,

41:13.049 --> 41:17.682
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

41:18.205 --> 41:27.351
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

41:28.331 --> 41:32.275
then what happens, you get understanding.

41:32.506 --> 41:38.913
Understanding of that person, you realize,

41:40.325 --> 41:43.935
as if identified with that person.

41:44.812 --> 41:49.638
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

41:49.839 --> 41:55.379
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

41:55.580 --> 42:00.265
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

42:00.465 --> 42:05.665
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

42:09.427 --> 42:15.411
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

42:15.612 --> 42:19.011
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

42:19.212 --> 42:23.978
The identification with another is very
important.

42:28.550 --> 42:34.111
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

42:35.353 --> 42:40.920
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

42:42.328 --> 42:49.277
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

42:49.477 --> 42:56.472
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

42:58.079 --> 43:09.180
This ego will immediately sucked in

43:09.381 --> 43:15.990
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

43:21.021 --> 43:25.770
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

43:27.103 --> 43:36.047
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

43:36.916 --> 43:40.627
Because you are a realized soul.

43:43.980 --> 43:48.090
Also, as I said,

43:50.197 --> 43:54.267
when you are identified with another
person,

43:54.863 --> 44:00.493
you put that person in charge of divinity -

44:06.227 --> 44:12.042
just a feeling of oneness.

44:15.065 --> 44:21.980
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

44:24.896 --> 44:31.208
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

44:31.409 --> 44:38.657
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

44:38.858 --> 44:43.253
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

44:43.454 --> 44:49.259
Not a saint, saint never says that.

44:50.172 --> 44:52.033
That time, when you say that,

44:52.234 --> 44:55.797
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

44:55.998 --> 44:58.352
For example, the one, now supposing

44:58.553 --> 45:03.770
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

45:05.258 --> 45:09.011
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

45:09.212 --> 45:14.188
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

45:18.708 --> 45:23.045
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

45:23.807 --> 45:26.849
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

45:27.050 --> 45:30.010
or the gentleman who has done it,

45:30.752 --> 45:35.157
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

45:35.808 --> 45:40.367
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

45:40.568 --> 45:43.274
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

45:43.475 --> 45:47.792
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

45:51.665 --> 45:55.288
Who are you to judge anyone?

46:00.713 --> 46:09.412
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

46:10.551 --> 46:17.628
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

46:17.829 --> 46:21.768
So why waste energy on judging others?

46:25.800 --> 46:31.661
We should see what is good in others,

46:33.586 --> 46:37.325
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

46:37.526 --> 46:40.042
everything first class.

46:42.334 --> 46:50.164
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

46:52.097 --> 46:56.895
You can watch, you can witness,

46:57.736 --> 47:03.230
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

47:03.431 --> 47:07.284
something that would upset others.

47:08.286 --> 47:11.200
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

47:11.401 --> 47:16.719
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

47:16.920 --> 47:20.457
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

47:20.658 --> 47:23.304
is just bubbling through that,

47:23.505 --> 47:28.285
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

47:28.486 --> 47:33.474
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

47:33.815 --> 47:36.540
You can be in the same position.

47:36.741 --> 47:39.287
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

47:39.487 --> 47:42.522
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

47:42.722 --> 47:47.326
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

47:47.810 --> 47:53.128
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

47:53.426 --> 47:57.508
you are too great to bother about these
things.

47:58.511 --> 48:04.629
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

48:04.830 --> 48:09.171
and just making yourselves small.

48:11.405 --> 48:17.887
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

48:18.088 --> 48:26.037
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

48:27.200 --> 48:32.905
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

48:34.512 --> 48:40.885
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

48:41.670 --> 48:45.611
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

48:47.258 --> 48:50.787
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

48:53.644 --> 48:57.963
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

49:03.229 --> 49:10.433
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

49:10.634 --> 49:13.985
what love I have expressed?

49:14.399 --> 49:19.342
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

49:20.294 --> 49:26.898
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

49:27.099 --> 49:30.956
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

49:31.156 --> 49:36.544
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

49:36.745 --> 49:43.272
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

49:43.569 --> 49:46.684
But what have you done

49:50.382 --> 49:54.636
in this realm of reality?

49:55.184 --> 49:58.961
Have you enjoyed the reality?

50:00.318 --> 50:10.859
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

50:13.895 --> 50:24.182
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

50:25.428 --> 50:31.064
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

50:31.265 --> 50:37.403
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

50:37.942 --> 50:46.689
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

50:48.619 --> 51:02.382
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

51:03.835 --> 51:08.327
So ugly this world has become.

51:09.875 --> 51:13.054
Can you beautify it?

51:15.725 --> 51:19.747
You can, because you can transform people.

51:19.948 --> 51:27.419
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

51:29.677 --> 51:36.205
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

51:37.340 --> 51:43.734
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

51:44.884 --> 51:52.081
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

51:52.282 --> 51:57.431
The another side is that we are still
identified

51:57.631 --> 52:02.091
with things which we should not have been
identified.

52:04.333 --> 52:07.164
We can just find out.

52:09.414 --> 52:19.027
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

52:22.007 --> 52:32.237
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

52:34.503 --> 52:38.452
All the fools, you see,

52:38.653 --> 52:45.212
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

52:45.413 --> 52:55.335
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

52:56.375 --> 52:59.993
God knows when it is going to collide.

53:00.525 --> 53:06.503
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

53:06.704 --> 53:10.534
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

53:10.735 --> 53:14.396
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

53:14.597 --> 53:18.667
come home and again quarrel and fight.

53:21.203 --> 53:25.253
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

53:25.634 --> 53:28.994
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

53:29.195 --> 53:33.236
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

53:33.437 --> 53:37.938
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

53:38.139 --> 53:42.029
and what happens to them? Nothing.

53:42.332 --> 53:46.939
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

53:47.140 --> 53:52.535
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

53:53.265 --> 53:58.506
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

54:02.160 --> 54:07.792
I've known so many people like that.

54:12.046 --> 54:20.555
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

54:20.756 --> 54:24.799
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

54:25.000 --> 54:30.396
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

54:30.597 --> 54:34.381
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

54:34.582 --> 54:40.804
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

54:41.971 --> 54:46.424
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

54:46.624 --> 54:49.836
everybody knew he's having a bath,

54:50.037 --> 54:56.313
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

54:56.514 --> 55:02.164
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

55:02.751 --> 55:05.260
and I heard something like,

55:05.461 --> 55:08.583
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

55:08.784 --> 55:11.839
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

55:12.040 --> 55:16.848
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

55:17.049 --> 55:21.163
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

55:21.364 --> 55:27.044
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

55:27.244 --> 55:35.032
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

55:35.232 --> 55:37.918
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

55:38.119 --> 55:43.249
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

55:44.943 --> 55:48.970
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

55:49.446 --> 55:53.185
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

55:53.386 --> 56:00.398
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

56:00.599 --> 56:09.799
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

56:10.497 --> 56:14.122
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

56:14.323 --> 56:20.960
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

56:22.008 --> 56:25.852
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

56:26.053 --> 56:31.403
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

56:31.604 --> 56:37.359
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

56:37.560 --> 56:44.993
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

56:45.707 --> 56:50.040
That kills the full experience of reality.

56:51.606 --> 56:56.866
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

56:57.067 --> 57:01.781
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

57:01.982 --> 57:04.780
morning till evening.

57:05.744 --> 57:07.996
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

57:08.197 --> 57:10.477
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

57:10.678 --> 57:13.778
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

57:13.979 --> 57:16.731
But we are not brainless people.

57:16.932 --> 57:21.942
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

57:22.657 --> 57:26.595
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

57:26.796 --> 57:30.511
or which are something, we don't.

57:33.091 --> 57:43.606
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

57:45.558 --> 57:52.663
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

57:53.846 --> 57:57.966
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

57:58.167 --> 58:01.244
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

58:01.445 --> 58:08.032
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

58:08.233 --> 58:15.643
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

58:17.486 --> 58:28.148
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

58:28.349 --> 58:36.119
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

58:37.941 --> 58:43.298
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

58:43.499 --> 58:49.437
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

58:49.638 --> 58:54.469
It's absolutely a flexible personality

58:54.670 --> 59:05.379
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

59:08.454 --> 59:15.367
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

59:16.922 --> 59:23.914
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

59:24.115 --> 59:32.803
that are facing us because of stupidity.

59:34.632 --> 59:38.842
This integration I'm sure will take place,

59:41.370 --> 59:49.717
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

59:50.233 --> 59:59.970
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:03.364
It's going to happen.

01:00:03.943 --> 01:00:08.766
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

01:00:08.967 --> 01:00:14.848
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:20.759
to truth and reality? It will.

01:00:21.331 --> 01:00:26.335
So today, on such an important day for us,

01:00:26.536 --> 01:00:33.104
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

01:00:33.305 --> 01:00:43.104
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:49.391
light of compassion, light of love

01:00:51.419 --> 01:01:00.170
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

01:01:00.813 --> 01:01:08.684
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:13.085
May God bless you.

01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:02.985
Yogi: Shri Ganesha mantra 3 times.

01:16:53.933 --> 01:16:56.282
Yogi: “All the leaders”.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:27.848
Yogi: So, with the permission of Shri
Mataji, we are going to recite together

01:18:28.049 --> 01:18:33.341
the 108 Thank You's to our Divine Mother

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:39.413
which have been composed for this occasion
of Sahasrara Puja.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:44.715
And we are going to perform it the way
that the mantra is read,

01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:52.887
and after the mantra we all say together,
"Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again."

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.451
1) Thank You for descending from Your
heavenly abode, Mata Dwipa,

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:04.209

Yuga.

Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:21:51.898 --> 01:21:56.339
21) Thank You for crowning the work

23) Thank You for giving true meaning

01:22:11.935 --> 01:22:16.548
who have sacrificed their lives
for the emancipation of mankind.

01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:20.456
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:22:20.657 --> 01:22:26.527
24) Thank You for reestablishing hope,

Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:22:31.117 --> 01:22:34.331
25) Thank You for lifting the human
self-determination

01:22:34.532 --> 01:22:39.102
beyond the concepts of race, caste system
and religion.

01:22:39.278 --> 01:22:43.129
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:46.984
26) Thank You for giving divine meaning
to the idea of freedom,

01:22:47.185 --> 01:22:49.491
equality and brotherhood.

Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:22:53.481 --> 01:22:57.179

one experience and one truth.

Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:04.340 --> 01:23:10.711
28) Thank You for inviting mankind
into the realms of the Absolute.

01:23:10.912 --> 01:23:14.334
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:14.535 --> 01:23:19.182
29) Thank You for liberating us from
the illusion of a dualistic world.

01:23:19.383 --> 01:23:22.789
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:25.419
30) Thank You for liberating us from
ignorance,

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:28.244
confusion and solitude.

01:23:28.446 --> 01:23:31.820
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:32.021 --> 01:23:36.637
31) Thank You for exposing the demonic
forces of the materialistic world.

01:23:36.838 --> 01:23:40.379
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:44.971
32) Thank You for exposing the inefficiency
of linear thinking.

01:23:45.172 --> 01:23:48.185
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:48.386 --> 01:23:51.117
33) Thank You for exposing the cruelty
and danger

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:53.910
of patriarchal politics.

01:23:54.111 --> 01:23:57.037
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:23:57.238 --> 01:23:59.817
34) Thank You for destroying enslaving
personal

01:24:00.018 --> 01:24:02.933
and social patterns and conditionings.
