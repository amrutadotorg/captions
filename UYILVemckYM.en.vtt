00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:37.123
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:45.071
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

00:04:45.272 --> 00:04:48.796
for all the humanity.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:55.312
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

00:04:55.512 --> 00:05:00.599
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.020
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:14.078
When this happened

00:05:17.906 --> 00:05:23.582
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:29.235
because no one would understand Me,

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:36.953
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:42.772
to say something about Sahasrara.

00:05:44.562 --> 00:05:54.611
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:06:03.202
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

00:06:03.403 --> 00:06:09.463
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

00:06:10.836 --> 00:06:19.622
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

00:06:22.524 --> 00:06:31.933
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

00:06:32.777 --> 00:06:36.948
and unless and until there are many lights,

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:44.025
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:49.630
It is a human error, also, all the time,

00:06:49.883 --> 00:06:57.077
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

00:06:57.277 --> 00:07:02.409
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.097
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:11.909
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:17.757
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

00:07:17.957 --> 00:07:24.268
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:28.756
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:36.783
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

00:07:36.984 --> 00:07:41.552
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:49.141
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:58.408
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

00:07:58.609 --> 00:08:04.777
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

00:08:04.977 --> 00:08:11.871
Human level is moving on another plane

00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:17.104
and it has to come up to a higher plane

00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:23.639
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

00:08:25.176 --> 00:08:30.128
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

00:08:30.395 --> 00:08:36.941
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:40.744
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:44.285
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

00:08:44.486 --> 00:08:50.670
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

00:08:53.179 --> 00:09:02.211
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

00:09:02.412 --> 00:09:09.620
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:15.925
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:20.232
their fondness for things may be different,

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:26.287
but inside they are all very beautiful.

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:33.711
And this I found out, one after another.

00:09:33.912 --> 00:09:38.826
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

00:09:39.027 --> 00:09:46.309
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

00:09:47.227 --> 00:09:50.779
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.017
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

00:09:54.218 --> 00:10:01.283
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:10.985
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.452
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:24.894
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:32.539
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:40.993
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

00:10:41.192 --> 00:10:45.628
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:49.015
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

00:10:49.216 --> 00:10:53.956
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:59.469
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:08.218
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

00:11:08.623 --> 00:11:17.497
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:29.725
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

00:11:29.924 --> 00:11:37.042
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:46.752
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

00:11:47.268 --> 00:11:58.657
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:06.295
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

00:12:06.495 --> 00:12:11.564
which gave them sense of reality,

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:18.242
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:26.125
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:32.708
I didn't say that it took Me long,

00:12:32.907 --> 00:12:37.375
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

00:12:37.576 --> 00:12:41.512
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

00:12:41.713 --> 00:12:48.378
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:55.177
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

00:12:55.378 --> 00:13:00.026
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:02.993
but only I felt that from human level

00:13:03.193 --> 00:13:09.999
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

00:13:10.198 --> 00:13:15.329
then some of that still lingers on,

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:21.226
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:28.918
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

00:13:29.497 --> 00:13:38.362
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

00:13:38.562 --> 00:13:42.971
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:49.778
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:55.586
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

00:13:55.786 --> 00:14:04.272
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:11.240
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:18.333
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

00:14:21.363 --> 00:14:28.734
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:33.450
maybe it's your own understanding.

00:14:33.651 --> 00:14:40.201
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:46.305
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:51.468
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

00:14:51.669 --> 00:14:56.381
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

00:14:56.582 --> 00:15:02.810
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.327
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:10.994
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

00:15:11.194 --> 00:15:20.615
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

00:15:20.815 --> 00:15:28.327
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

00:15:29.602 --> 00:15:35.353
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

00:15:51.363 --> 00:15:57.166
When you feel responsible, you must know

00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:03.276
that you are not in charge, one thing.

00:16:03.485 --> 00:16:12.399
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:22.572
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:29.073
So to think that you are doing anything

00:16:29.273 --> 00:16:34.589
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

00:16:34.787 --> 00:16:40.231
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:45.345
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:49.852
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

00:16:50.052 --> 00:16:56.649
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

00:16:57.044 --> 00:17:04.753
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.582
this great tree of spirituality within you.

00:17:10.818 --> 00:17:20.246
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

00:17:20.455 --> 00:17:28.869
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

00:17:29.983 --> 00:17:38.341
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:44.619
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.962
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

00:17:51.163 --> 00:17:54.639
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:57.875
You are testing yourself, and now must know

00:17:58.075 --> 00:18:03.161
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:09.431
where very few have entered.

00:18:19.649 --> 00:18:23.881
And there in that garden, when you enter,

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:34.935
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:42.682
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:51.413
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:55.848
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

00:18:56.048 --> 00:19:00.036
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

00:19:00.237 --> 00:19:06.404
that friendship, without any expectation.

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:10.875
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

00:19:11.075 --> 00:19:16.685
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

00:19:16.885 --> 00:19:22.166
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

00:19:23.309 --> 00:19:28.030
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.438
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:38.200
or he's not doing much in life.

00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:50.968
This integration, this oneness,

00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:55.715
this feeling of identification with others

00:19:55.916 --> 00:20:02.207
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

00:20:05.064 --> 00:20:11.245
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:17.259
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

00:20:17.459 --> 00:20:22.847
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

00:20:23.047 --> 00:20:28.247
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

00:20:28.479 --> 00:20:33.176
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

00:20:33.377 --> 00:20:38.757
but I've seen how it happens.

00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:47.416
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

00:20:47.616 --> 00:20:53.465
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

00:20:55.302 --> 00:20:57.999
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:05.033
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

00:21:05.234 --> 00:21:09.709
Here then, you become absolutely humble

00:21:10.111 --> 00:21:14.428
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

00:21:15.888 --> 00:21:19.886
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

00:21:20.085 --> 00:21:24.999
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:34.008
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:40.824
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

00:21:41.753 --> 00:21:48.913
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

00:21:49.114 --> 00:21:54.981
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

00:21:55.421 --> 00:22:00.531
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

00:22:03.603 --> 00:22:08.717
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.823
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

00:22:15.066 --> 00:22:25.019
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

00:22:25.728 --> 00:22:30.448
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:34.707
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

00:22:37.378 --> 00:22:41.417
Such a flexible temperament you developed

00:22:41.618 --> 00:22:46.372
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

00:22:46.609 --> 00:22:51.222
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

00:22:51.423 --> 00:22:56.072
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

00:22:56.271 --> 00:23:03.273
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

00:23:03.474 --> 00:23:11.180
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

00:23:13.252 --> 00:23:19.104
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

00:23:19.305 --> 00:23:25.624
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:30.222
to do this great job, to do that.

00:23:36.268 --> 00:23:45.281
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.924
nor you should think that you are very
small.

00:23:52.881 --> 00:24:01.592
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:10.884
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

00:24:11.084 --> 00:24:15.451
It could expand into anything,

00:24:16.525 --> 00:24:21.972
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

00:24:23.072 --> 00:24:31.039
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

00:24:32.238 --> 00:24:38.338
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

00:24:38.538 --> 00:24:44.563
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

00:24:44.763 --> 00:24:49.769
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

00:24:50.024 --> 00:24:56.715
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

00:24:58.179 --> 00:25:05.152
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

00:25:05.353 --> 00:25:11.163
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

00:25:11.362 --> 00:25:18.904
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

00:25:20.287 --> 00:25:23.425
I'll give you an example.

00:25:24.546 --> 00:25:31.014
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

00:25:31.215 --> 00:25:36.333
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:40.499
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

00:25:40.699 --> 00:25:47.107
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

00:25:47.308 --> 00:25:52.109
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:59.259
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.192
and she couldn't move her fingers.

00:26:03.713 --> 00:26:08.817
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

00:26:09.017 --> 00:26:14.020
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.817
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

00:26:19.017 --> 00:26:23.304
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

00:26:25.941 --> 00:26:28.636
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:32.133
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

00:26:32.334 --> 00:26:34.997
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:37.270
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:40.935
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

00:26:41.213 --> 00:26:46.057
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

00:26:46.257 --> 00:26:49.833
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

00:26:50.034 --> 00:26:51.773
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

00:26:51.974 --> 00:26:56.890
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.871
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

00:27:04.708 --> 00:27:07.766
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

00:27:07.967 --> 00:27:13.773
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

00:27:13.974 --> 00:27:18.255
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

00:27:18.454 --> 00:27:20.815
if you have to do that, it will work out.

00:27:20.976 --> 00:27:25.554
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

00:27:26.084 --> 00:27:29.480
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:32.462
and who is not a realized soul.

00:27:32.662 --> 00:27:37.733
A realized soul person is not bothered

00:27:37.934 --> 00:27:45.100
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

00:27:46.369 --> 00:27:49.012
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:55.475
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:03.096
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

00:28:03.296 --> 00:28:07.818
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:11.642
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

00:28:11.843 --> 00:28:14.731
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

00:28:14.932 --> 00:28:20.860
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

00:28:21.173 --> 00:28:25.356
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

00:28:25.557 --> 00:28:28.556
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

00:28:28.757 --> 00:28:33.583
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

00:28:33.783 --> 00:28:37.431
That you can live under any circumstances

00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:44.309
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

00:28:45.926 --> 00:28:51.220
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

00:28:54.407 --> 00:29:00.343
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

00:29:00.544 --> 00:29:03.497
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

00:29:03.697 --> 00:29:06.509
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:10.579
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:18.167
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

00:29:18.734 --> 00:29:23.338
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:29.549
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

00:29:29.749 --> 00:29:38.593
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

00:29:39.064 --> 00:29:44.253
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

00:29:44.453 --> 00:29:50.588
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

00:29:50.982 --> 00:29:57.659
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

00:29:57.859 --> 00:30:06.048
If it can, it will, and also it tries

00:30:06.249 --> 00:30:14.688
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:20.947
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

00:30:21.148 --> 00:30:26.325
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

00:30:27.134 --> 00:30:32.975
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

00:30:33.309 --> 00:30:41.943
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:52.413
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

00:30:52.614 --> 00:30:58.845
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

00:30:59.046 --> 00:31:03.273
this Divine power, they cannot.

00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:08.626
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

00:31:08.827 --> 00:31:16.553
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

00:31:16.754 --> 00:31:22.915
and now you are just like great citizens

00:31:23.115 --> 00:31:30.435
of the great realm of divinity.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:37.031
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

00:31:37.999 --> 00:31:45.377
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

00:31:45.943 --> 00:31:55.858
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

00:31:56.358 --> 00:32:04.572
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

00:32:04.772 --> 00:32:10.556
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

00:32:10.756 --> 00:32:18.474
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

00:32:19.006 --> 00:32:25.130
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

00:32:25.311 --> 00:32:30.389
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:35.850
But it never means that you should give up,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:41.614
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

00:32:41.815 --> 00:32:49.850
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

00:32:50.305 --> 00:32:54.331
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

00:32:54.531 --> 00:33:01.528
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

00:33:01.728 --> 00:33:07.804
or I do not earnestly want anything.

00:33:09.785 --> 00:33:14.439
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

00:33:15.303 --> 00:33:21.501
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

00:33:21.762 --> 00:33:27.011
You people are very differently made.

00:33:27.212 --> 00:33:30.485
Because you have achieved something.

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:47.367
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

00:33:48.315 --> 00:33:51.083
Because you’ve achieved something,

00:33:51.284 --> 00:33:58.107
you know how you were and what you are now.

00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:09.167
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

00:34:10.544 --> 00:34:15.172
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

00:34:15.373 --> 00:34:20.483
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

00:34:20.684 --> 00:34:26.107
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

00:34:26.308 --> 00:34:34.698
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

00:34:35.182 --> 00:34:41.641
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:47.299
You have crossed the bondage and now

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.836
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

00:34:53.665 --> 00:35:00.594
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

00:35:00.794 --> 00:35:09.634
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

00:35:09.835 --> 00:35:13.644
then this lotus opens like this.

00:35:14.799 --> 00:35:19.822
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

00:35:21.517 --> 00:35:26.628
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:33.278
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

00:35:33.479 --> 00:35:39.514
just like these, and they look like flames.

00:35:39.714 --> 00:35:46.329
But these flames are not with any heat,

00:35:46.529 --> 00:35:51.747
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

00:35:51.947 --> 00:35:59.246
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

00:36:00.938 --> 00:36:06.282
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

00:36:06.663 --> 00:36:14.156
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

00:36:16.477 --> 00:36:19.441
This is what has happened to you.

00:36:21.162 --> 00:36:26.847
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

00:36:29.265 --> 00:36:34.652
and there where we fail, sometimes,

00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:41.912
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

00:36:43.039 --> 00:36:50.897
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

00:36:51.098 --> 00:36:54.715
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

00:36:54.916 --> 00:37:03.838
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

00:37:09.533 --> 00:37:12.471
So you have to be,

00:37:20.364 --> 00:37:23.345
you have to be on the guard,

00:37:25.207 --> 00:37:30.917
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

00:37:32.322 --> 00:37:37.706
The first is ego, which how to attack,

00:37:37.907 --> 00:37:43.021
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

00:37:43.625 --> 00:37:46.803
that's the only vehicle.

00:37:51.096 --> 00:37:56.590
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

00:37:56.791 --> 00:38:01.313
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

00:38:03.269 --> 00:38:08.511
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:15.434
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:20.367
Why are you angry?

00:38:21.407 --> 00:38:26.494
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

00:38:26.695 --> 00:38:29.936
or to check someone? Why?

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.219
The mind will not answer.

00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:39.436
The simple thing, if you can do,

00:38:39.637 --> 00:38:45.353
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

00:38:46.337 --> 00:38:52.930
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:58.787
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

00:38:58.987 --> 00:39:02.114
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

00:39:02.315 --> 00:39:07.937
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

00:39:10.314 --> 00:39:14.115
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

00:39:14.316 --> 00:39:19.020
just know that you have to love that person.

00:39:21.754 --> 00:39:25.789
Now, how will you love that person?

00:39:25.989 --> 00:39:33.382
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

00:39:33.583 --> 00:39:38.973
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

00:39:40.977 --> 00:39:46.113
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

00:39:46.724 --> 00:39:52.284
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

00:39:52.484 --> 00:39:56.187
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

00:39:56.388 --> 00:40:00.597
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

00:40:00.813 --> 00:40:05.729
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

00:40:05.983 --> 00:40:08.693
Very amusing.

00:40:11.388 --> 00:40:15.920
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:23.185
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

00:40:23.386 --> 00:40:27.173
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

00:40:27.374 --> 00:40:30.177
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

00:40:30.345 --> 00:40:31.457
makes no difference.

00:40:31.658 --> 00:40:36.901
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

00:40:37.102 --> 00:40:43.977
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

00:40:45.878 --> 00:40:49.409
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:54.865
and that's the only source of her life,

00:40:55.066 --> 00:40:59.192
then I can understand why she is so upset.

00:41:05.372 --> 00:41:08.237
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

00:41:08.438 --> 00:41:12.557
very easily, it's not difficult,

00:41:13.049 --> 00:41:17.682
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

00:41:18.205 --> 00:41:27.351
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:32.275
then what happens, you get understanding.

00:41:32.506 --> 00:41:38.913
Understanding of that person, you realize,

00:41:40.325 --> 00:41:43.935
as if identified with that person.

00:41:44.812 --> 00:41:49.638
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:55.379
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.265
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

00:42:00.465 --> 00:42:05.665
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

00:42:09.427 --> 00:42:15.411
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

00:42:15.612 --> 00:42:19.011
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

00:42:19.212 --> 00:42:23.978
The identification with another is very
important.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:34.111
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:40.920
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

00:42:42.328 --> 00:42:49.277
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

00:42:49.477 --> 00:42:56.472
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:09.180
This ego will immediately sucked in

00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:15.990
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:25.770
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

00:43:27.103 --> 00:43:36.047
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

00:43:36.916 --> 00:43:40.627
Because you are a realized soul.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:48.090
Also, as I said,

00:43:50.197 --> 00:43:54.267
when you are identified with another
person,

00:43:54.863 --> 00:44:00.493
you put that person in charge of divinity -

00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:12.042
just a feeling of oneness.

00:44:15.065 --> 00:44:21.980
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

00:44:24.896 --> 00:44:31.208
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

00:44:31.409 --> 00:44:38.657
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

00:44:38.858 --> 00:44:43.253
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

00:44:43.454 --> 00:44:49.259
Not a saint, saint never says that.

00:44:50.172 --> 00:44:52.033
That time, when you say that,

00:44:52.234 --> 00:44:55.797
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

00:44:55.998 --> 00:44:58.352
For example, the one, now supposing

00:44:58.553 --> 00:45:03.770
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

00:45:05.258 --> 00:45:09.011
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

00:45:09.212 --> 00:45:14.188
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

00:45:18.708 --> 00:45:23.045
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

00:45:23.807 --> 00:45:26.849
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.010
or the gentleman who has done it,

00:45:30.752 --> 00:45:35.157
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

00:45:35.808 --> 00:45:40.367
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

00:45:40.568 --> 00:45:43.274
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:47.792
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:55.288
Who are you to judge anyone?

00:46:00.713 --> 00:46:09.412
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

00:46:10.551 --> 00:46:17.628
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:21.768
So why waste energy on judging others?

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:31.661
We should see what is good in others,

00:46:33.586 --> 00:46:37.325
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:40.042
everything first class.

00:46:42.334 --> 00:46:50.164
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

00:46:52.097 --> 00:46:56.895
You can watch, you can witness,

00:46:57.736 --> 00:47:03.230
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

00:47:03.431 --> 00:47:07.284
something that would upset others.

00:47:08.286 --> 00:47:11.200
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

00:47:11.401 --> 00:47:16.719
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.457
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

00:47:20.658 --> 00:47:23.304
is just bubbling through that,

00:47:23.505 --> 00:47:28.285
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

00:47:28.486 --> 00:47:33.474
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:36.540
You can be in the same position.

00:47:36.741 --> 00:47:39.287
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

00:47:39.487 --> 00:47:42.522
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

00:47:42.722 --> 00:47:47.326
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:53.128
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

00:47:53.426 --> 00:47:57.508
you are too great to bother about these
things.

00:47:58.511 --> 00:48:04.629
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:09.171
and just making yourselves small.

00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:17.887
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

00:48:18.088 --> 00:48:26.037
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:32.905
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:40.885
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:45.611
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:50.787
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:53.644 --> 00:48:57.963
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

00:49:03.229 --> 00:49:10.433
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

00:49:10.634 --> 00:49:13.985
what love I have expressed?

00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:19.342
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

00:49:20.294 --> 00:49:26.898
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

00:49:27.099 --> 00:49:30.956
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

00:49:31.156 --> 00:49:36.544
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

00:49:36.745 --> 00:49:43.272
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

00:49:43.569 --> 00:49:46.684
But what have you done

00:49:50.382 --> 00:49:54.636
in this realm of reality?

00:49:55.184 --> 00:49:58.961
Have you enjoyed the reality?

00:50:00.318 --> 00:50:10.859
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

00:50:13.895 --> 00:50:24.182
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

00:50:25.428 --> 00:50:31.064
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

00:50:31.265 --> 00:50:37.403
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

00:50:37.942 --> 00:50:46.689
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

00:50:48.619 --> 00:51:02.382
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

00:51:03.835 --> 00:51:08.327
So ugly this world has become.

00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:13.054
Can you beautify it?

00:51:15.725 --> 00:51:19.747
You can, because you can transform people.

00:51:19.948 --> 00:51:27.419
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

00:51:29.677 --> 00:51:36.205
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:43.734
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

00:51:44.884 --> 00:51:52.081
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

00:51:52.282 --> 00:51:57.431
The another side is that we are still
identified

00:51:57.631 --> 00:52:02.091
with things which we should not have been
identified.

00:52:04.333 --> 00:52:07.164
We can just find out.

00:52:09.414 --> 00:52:19.027
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

00:52:22.007 --> 00:52:32.237
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

00:52:34.503 --> 00:52:38.452
All the fools, you see,

00:52:38.653 --> 00:52:45.212
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

00:52:45.413 --> 00:52:55.335
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

00:52:56.375 --> 00:52:59.993
God knows when it is going to collide.

00:53:00.525 --> 00:53:06.503
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

00:53:06.704 --> 00:53:10.534
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

00:53:10.735 --> 00:53:14.396
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

00:53:14.597 --> 00:53:18.667
come home and again quarrel and fight.

00:53:21.203 --> 00:53:25.253
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

00:53:25.634 --> 00:53:28.994
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

00:53:29.195 --> 00:53:33.236
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

00:53:33.437 --> 00:53:37.938
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

00:53:38.139 --> 00:53:42.029
and what happens to them? Nothing.

00:53:42.332 --> 00:53:46.939
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:52.535
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

00:53:53.265 --> 00:53:58.506
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.792
I've known so many people like that.

00:54:12.046 --> 00:54:20.555
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

00:54:20.756 --> 00:54:24.799
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.396
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

00:54:30.597 --> 00:54:34.381
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

00:54:34.582 --> 00:54:40.804
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:46.424
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

00:54:46.624 --> 00:54:49.836
everybody knew he's having a bath,

00:54:50.037 --> 00:54:56.313
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

00:54:56.514 --> 00:55:02.164
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

00:55:02.751 --> 00:55:05.260
and I heard something like,

00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:08.583
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

00:55:08.784 --> 00:55:11.839
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.848
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

00:55:17.049 --> 00:55:21.163
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

00:55:21.364 --> 00:55:27.044
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

00:55:27.244 --> 00:55:35.032
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:37.918
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

00:55:38.119 --> 00:55:43.249
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

00:55:44.943 --> 00:55:48.970
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:53.185
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

00:55:53.386 --> 00:56:00.398
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

00:56:00.599 --> 00:56:09.799
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

00:56:10.497 --> 00:56:14.122
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

00:56:14.323 --> 00:56:20.960
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

00:56:22.008 --> 00:56:25.852
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

00:56:26.053 --> 00:56:31.403
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

00:56:31.604 --> 00:56:37.359
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:44.993
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

00:56:45.707 --> 00:56:50.040
That kills the full experience of reality.

00:56:51.606 --> 00:56:56.866
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

00:56:57.067 --> 00:57:01.781
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

00:57:01.982 --> 00:57:04.780
morning till evening.

00:57:05.744 --> 00:57:07.996
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

00:57:08.197 --> 00:57:10.477
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

00:57:10.678 --> 00:57:13.778
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

00:57:13.979 --> 00:57:16.731
But we are not brainless people.

00:57:16.932 --> 00:57:21.942
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

00:57:22.657 --> 00:57:26.595
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

00:57:26.796 --> 00:57:30.511
or which are something, we don't.

00:57:33.091 --> 00:57:43.606
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

00:57:45.558 --> 00:57:52.663
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

00:57:53.846 --> 00:57:57.966
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

00:57:58.167 --> 00:58:01.244
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

00:58:01.445 --> 00:58:08.032
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

00:58:08.233 --> 00:58:15.643
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

00:58:17.486 --> 00:58:28.148
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:36.119
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

00:58:37.941 --> 00:58:43.298
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

00:58:43.499 --> 00:58:49.437
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

00:58:49.638 --> 00:58:54.469
It's absolutely a flexible personality

00:58:54.670 --> 00:59:05.379
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

00:59:08.454 --> 00:59:15.367
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

00:59:16.922 --> 00:59:23.914
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

00:59:24.115 --> 00:59:32.803
that are facing us because of stupidity.

00:59:34.632 --> 00:59:38.842
This integration I'm sure will take place,

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:49.717
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

00:59:50.233 --> 00:59:59.970
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:03.364
It's going to happen.

01:00:03.943 --> 01:00:08.766
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

01:00:08.967 --> 01:00:14.848
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

01:00:15.049 --> 01:00:20.759
to truth and reality? It will.

01:00:21.331 --> 01:00:26.335
So today, on such an important day for us,

01:00:26.536 --> 01:00:33.104
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

01:00:33.305 --> 01:00:43.104
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:49.391
light of compassion, light of love

01:00:51.419 --> 01:01:00.170
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

01:01:00.813 --> 01:01:08.684
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:13.085
May God bless you.

01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:02.985
Yogi: Shri Ganesha mantra 3 times.

01:16:53.933 --> 01:16:56.282
Yogi: “All the leaders”.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:27.848
Yogi: So, with the permission of Shri
Mataji, we are going to recite together

01:18:28.049 --> 01:18:33.341
the 108 Thank You's to our Divine Mother

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:39.413
which have been composed for this occasion
of Sahasrara Puja.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:44.715
And we are going to perform it the way
that the mantra is read,

01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:52.887
and after the mantra we all say together,
"Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again."

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.451
1) Thank You for descending from Your
heavenly abode, Mata Dwipa,

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:04.209
to bring light into the darkness of Kali
Yuga.

01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:08.279
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:15.089
2) Thank You for delivering Sahaja Yoga to
a confused and self-destructive humanity.

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:19.684
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:24.624
3) Thank You for revealing the meaning
of creation and evolution to us.

01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:28.460
Thank You, Shri Mataji, again and again.

01:19:28.661 --> 01:19:33.727
