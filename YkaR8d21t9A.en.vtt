00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:09.154
This was least expected that we'll have a Puja here or

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.726
we'll have any program of this kind.

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:19.594
But I think something was left out of the whole

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:26.106
program of such a fast one as you know

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:31.232
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.741
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:39.093
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

00:00:39.118 --> 00:00:42.674
And I came here in London I learned that

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.587
there was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.328
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.519
because it is the sister relationship and brother relationship.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:09.646
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna was born

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.353
the day his sister was born,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.884
and this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.305
I should say, into a lightning later on,

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:31.466
but She was the one who announced

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:37.946
the existence of Shri Krishna at that time -

00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:42.260
that He is born and He is living, He is in the present.

00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:47.072
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of the lightning,

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:52.782
and you have seen that whenever
I am going to any place, or

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:56.550
I will be giving a program or something, just before that,

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:01.221
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears in the sky, you see,

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:04.545
to show that announcement.

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:09.316
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.675
To make it more practical and understanding is

00:02:15.715 --> 00:02:21.250
that we use electricity now for our televisions,

00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:25.916
for our announcements, for telling people about messages

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.433
of something of great importance.

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:31.632
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:36.906
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:39.532
of the coming of Adi Shakti.

00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:44.224
But on the contrary, people start using it as a pocket

00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:48.722
kept for our extra ego to be filled.

00:02:50.171 --> 00:02:55.441
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty when

00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:59.817
our sense of relationships are not all right.

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:08.309
For example, we do not understand a sister

00:03:09.978 --> 00:03:15.089
and a brother, the relationship, which is very pure,

00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:20.732
and is above all kinds of contamination.

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:27.667
But as you know in the West,

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:33.670
because maybe of drinking and doing all kinds of things

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:37.747
which are against awareness, people have lost the value system,

00:03:37.827 --> 00:03:40.293
and in that they have also lost

00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:44.376
the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:51.484
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely important -

00:03:51.706 --> 00:04:01.894
because of Her, announcement of an incarnation takes place.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.388
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:11.092
It works it out.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.717
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides in the left Vishuddhi,

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:23.547
and I find that Vishnumaya is the thing that suffers
the most, especially in the West,

00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:26.898
because it's a fashion to feel guilty about everything.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:35.387
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.898
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing on this Earth,

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:45.760
if you see from a practical point of view might think
it's a wrong thing She has done,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.951
because to tell Kamsa that He exists and He resides,

00:04:51.977 --> 00:04:55.318
is still existing, is giving Him a danger

00:04:56.357 --> 00:04:59.599
and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

00:04:59.624 --> 00:05:03.300
If I had not told, he would not have known."

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:07.796
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

00:05:09.903 --> 00:05:13.732
So we have to see for ourselves that

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:17.803
what makes us guilty for small, small things

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.415
is actually is our own ego reacting against us and

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.724
wants us to reconcile with what mistakes we have committed.

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:30.861
Like some people feel guilty because

00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:35.629
they have said something they should not have said,

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:44.266
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:51.656
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:55.873
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:57.423
They feel guilty.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.448
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:04.250
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

00:06:04.275 --> 00:06:07.340
I mean such stupid things like that which are

00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:11.120
regarded as norms in the society and people start thinking

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:17.515
that these norms are very, very important -
as if they are something like a dharma

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.505
and you must maintain those
norms.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.637
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:31.089
You see some of them are so stupid and so horrifying

00:06:31.144 --> 00:06:35.086
that I think, in England I feel,
there are some, which must be really

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:38.945
completely squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.226
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone,

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:46.352
because God knows what kinds of hands people are having,

00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:48.764
what kinds of vibrations they have.

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.643
Now, when My husband has his reception
sometimes I have to shake hands

00:06:53.668 --> 00:07:02.067
with seven hundred people coming in,
and then seven hundred drunkards going out.

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.258
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:12.974
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,

00:07:13.022 --> 00:07:16.771
but for others to shake anybody's hand, is better to do Namaste,

00:07:16.796 --> 00:07:20.418
though it might be some a very simple Indian method,

00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:23.057
but I think is the best way is to say, "Namaste",

00:07:23.065 --> 00:07:29.139
because shaking hands can cause
lots of problems to human beings,

00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:33.272
and now with all these diseases coming up and all that,

00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:36.338
I think one has to be very careful about shaking hands.

00:07:36.528 --> 00:07:40.479
Worse than that is in France I find is like

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:43.169
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

00:07:43.194 --> 00:07:45.739
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:49.616
But they do kiss you all the time if you go there,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.824
I had very bad shocks to begin with, you see

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.327
anybody would just get you, kiss you here,

00:07:56.352 --> 00:07:58.996
kiss you there, you start looking at the person.

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:04.514
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

00:08:04.812 --> 00:08:06.925
But there is no need to do all,

00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:08.794
this is not a very good way of wishing anyone,

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:11.628
doesn't show any respect, in both the cases.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.506
When you shake hands also there's no respect

00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:17.442
and even when you kiss somebody there is no respect.

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:19.974
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",

00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:24.977
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect,

00:08:25.032 --> 00:08:29.029
and this is one thing we have to do is to respect each other.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.430
But when we are not then we feel guilty,

00:08:32.526 --> 00:08:36.303
and like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:38.431
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody

00:08:38.456 --> 00:08:40.744
then we think we have done a big mistake.

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:43.538
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you know.

00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:46.312
We get so much used to it,

00:08:46.994 --> 00:08:52.185
that even if you see a statue you say
"Thank you very much for your darshan."

00:08:52.423 --> 00:08:55.368
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit too much.

00:08:55.393 --> 00:08:58.807
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service - or "sorry".

00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:03.841
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:07.468
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

00:09:07.468 --> 00:09:11.637
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

00:09:11.662 --> 00:09:16.579
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:19.179
fault of the other person.

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:23.709
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:29.699
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:36.278
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

00:09:36.278 --> 00:09:41.119
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:42.239
person.

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:50.981
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:52.006
matter.

00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:57.019
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

00:09:57.019 --> 00:10:02.049
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:07.799
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:13.919
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:18.139
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:23.399
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:25.528
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

00:10:25.528 --> 00:10:29.889
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:32.838
car to move and the car was moving.

00:10:32.838 --> 00:10:34.829
I couldn't understand what was happening.

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:37.099
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

00:10:37.099 --> 00:10:38.099
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:10:38.099 --> 00:10:39.289
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

00:10:39.289 --> 00:10:42.599
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:43.819
you should say "Thank you".

00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:50.419
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:54.466
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:56.819
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

00:10:56.819 --> 00:11:04.103
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

00:11:04.128 --> 00:11:07.218
to people for what they have done.

00:11:07.394 --> 00:11:11.779
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:16.544
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:20.364
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:23.895
Either you go to the left or to the right.

00:11:23.895 --> 00:11:28.744
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

00:11:28.744 --> 00:11:35.144
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:37.914
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:42.394
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

00:11:42.394 --> 00:11:49.214
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

00:11:49.214 --> 00:11:54.404
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

00:11:54.404 --> 00:11:56.744
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

00:11:56.744 --> 00:11:58.504
Christmas card is not important.

00:11:58.504 --> 00:12:01.904
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

00:12:01.904 --> 00:12:03.214
Is to wish this person.

00:12:03.214 --> 00:12:05.953
Do you have that in your heart?

00:12:05.953 --> 00:12:09.104
Did you feel that from your heart?

00:12:09.104 --> 00:12:14.914
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

00:12:14.914 --> 00:12:19.294
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

00:12:19.294 --> 00:12:24.654
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

00:12:24.654 --> 00:12:30.013
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

00:12:30.013 --> 00:12:31.013
Should have done it.

00:12:31.013 --> 00:12:33.633
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:37.454
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

00:12:37.454 --> 00:12:41.974
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

00:12:41.974 --> 00:12:48.254
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

00:12:48.254 --> 00:12:50.134
have to worry about small, small things.

00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:55.263
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

00:12:55.263 --> 00:13:00.897
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:02.778
from their aggression.

00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:07.437
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

00:13:07.462 --> 00:13:12.290
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

00:13:12.351 --> 00:13:15.981
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

00:13:15.981 --> 00:13:17.653
I don't want."

00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:23.087
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

00:13:23.112 --> 00:13:26.432
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:31.562
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:36.702
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

00:13:36.702 --> 00:13:41.912
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

00:13:41.912 --> 00:13:47.222
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:53.794
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:56.379
But then he was told about it.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:03.600
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:05.767
saint I have a duty to perform.

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:14.297
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

00:14:14.297 --> 00:14:22.497
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

00:14:22.497 --> 00:14:30.467
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:38.907
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

00:14:38.907 --> 00:14:42.301
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

00:14:42.327 --> 00:14:44.257
the left Vishuddhi.

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:50.705
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

00:14:50.776 --> 00:14:58.528
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

00:14:58.528 --> 00:15:04.101
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

00:15:04.126 --> 00:15:06.688
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

00:15:06.713 --> 00:15:11.162
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

00:15:11.187 --> 00:15:16.727
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

00:15:16.727 --> 00:15:19.618
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

00:15:19.643 --> 00:15:27.213
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:33.436
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

00:15:33.436 --> 00:15:39.507
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

00:15:39.507 --> 00:15:42.186
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

00:15:42.186 --> 00:16:04.407
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:29.793
So this
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:37.284
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

00:16:37.284 --> 00:16:39.965
up, face it up and never do it again.

00:16:39.965 --> 00:16:44.475
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.889
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

00:16:47.746 --> 00:16:50.906
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:55.058
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

00:16:55.083 --> 00:16:57.253
Another thing is the announcement.

00:16:57.253 --> 00:17:01.652
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

00:17:01.652 --> 00:17:06.463
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

00:17:06.463 --> 00:17:08.253
have to go on telling about it.

00:17:08.253 --> 00:17:09.253
It works!

00:17:09.253 --> 00:17:10.253
It works very well.

00:17:10.253 --> 00:17:15.254
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:19.177
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

00:17:19.352 --> 00:17:22.692
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

00:17:22.692 --> 00:17:30.831
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.831
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

00:17:33.831 --> 00:17:37.181
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:38.466
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:39.738
He showed My photograph.

00:17:39.763 --> 00:17:40.763
Finished.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.933
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:54.382
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

00:17:54.382 --> 00:17:56.472
you singing, where are you fixed?"

00:17:56.472 --> 00:17:58.752
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

00:17:58.752 --> 00:18:06.202
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

00:18:06.202 --> 00:18:09.934
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

00:18:09.959 --> 00:18:12.272
The fellow was an Englishman.

00:18:12.272 --> 00:18:16.421
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

00:18:16.421 --> 00:18:17.626
Thik He."

00:18:17.928 --> 00:18:21.188
So these things announcement helps a lot.

00:18:21.681 --> 00:18:30.752
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

00:18:30.752 --> 00:18:34.451
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

00:18:34.476 --> 00:18:40.662
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:46.822
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

00:18:46.822 --> 00:18:47.822
people will know.

00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:51.212
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:53.032
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

00:18:53.032 --> 00:18:54.032
If you like you can wear.

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:55.032
But there's a freedom to you.

00:18:55.032 --> 00:18:58.242
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

00:18:58.242 --> 00:19:03.082
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

00:19:03.082 --> 00:19:04.892
wear these dresses and go about.

00:19:04.892 --> 00:19:08.932
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

00:19:08.932 --> 00:19:12.696
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:13.721
Why not?

00:19:13.815 --> 00:19:16.051
They would like to see you in sarees.

00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:17.362
If you want you can wear it.

00:19:17.362 --> 00:19:19.522
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

00:19:19.522 --> 00:19:21.791
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

00:19:21.791 --> 00:19:28.462
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:30.402
and those jeans and things like that.

00:19:30.402 --> 00:19:31.702
So it doesn't matter.

00:19:31.702 --> 00:19:33.982
But then don't feel guilty with it.

00:19:33.982 --> 00:19:38.582
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

00:19:38.582 --> 00:19:41.482
Be a brave person.

00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:46.362
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:48.572
Because you are brave you are doing it.

00:19:48.572 --> 00:19:50.082
That's the culture that has to come.

00:19:50.082 --> 00:19:53.822
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

00:19:53.822 --> 00:19:56.702
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

00:19:56.702 --> 00:19:57.801
Is it good?

00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:03.642
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

00:20:03.642 --> 00:20:07.042
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

00:20:07.042 --> 00:20:10.322
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

00:20:10.322 --> 00:20:13.102
All right, some people can, but not all.

00:20:13.102 --> 00:20:17.911
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:22.182
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

00:20:22.182 --> 00:20:27.572
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:33.282
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:35.811
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

00:20:35.954 --> 00:20:39.852
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

00:20:39.852 --> 00:20:47.102
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

00:20:47.102 --> 00:20:48.102
beings.

00:20:48.102 --> 00:20:53.041
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

00:20:53.041 --> 00:20:54.832
into the state of Virata.

00:20:54.832 --> 00:20:59.372
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

00:20:59.372 --> 00:21:04.152
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

00:21:04.152 --> 00:21:06.042
How can you be guilty?

00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:08.852
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.402
He's the One.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:13.516
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

00:21:13.588 --> 00:21:15.877
You don't blame your hand for it.

00:21:15.902 --> 00:21:18.363
What you blame is the body.

00:21:18.427 --> 00:21:20.902
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

00:21:20.902 --> 00:21:22.702
The body takes over.

00:21:22.702 --> 00:21:26.112
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

00:21:26.112 --> 00:21:30.558
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:34.839
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:41.260
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.169
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:47.480
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.020
It has no place.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.560
It has no place.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.990
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.310
What's the logic?

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.920
You cannot feel guilty.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:07.060
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.880
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.830
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.570
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.640
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.640
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:29.150
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.150
No!

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:37.705
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

00:22:40.403 --> 00:22:47.620
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.110
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

00:22:52.135 --> 00:22:55.069
The collectivity part of it.

00:22:55.379 --> 00:23:00.566
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

00:23:00.591 --> 00:23:05.219
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:09.699
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

00:23:09.699 --> 00:23:17.823
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:27.956
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

00:23:27.981 --> 00:23:29.004
into thin air.

00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:35.501
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:38.141
God knows where it has gone.

00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:42.459
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:44.300
what it is.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:54.729
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

00:23:54.966 --> 00:24:04.158
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

00:24:04.255 --> 00:24:06.311
Herself, shines and announces.

00:24:06.311 --> 00:24:09.849
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

00:24:09.874 --> 00:24:10.619
it?

00:24:10.644 --> 00:24:12.166
We are saints.

00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:13.271
Of course we are.

00:24:13.296 --> 00:24:14.456
"Are you saints??"

00:24:14.481 --> 00:24:15.641
"Yes, we are."

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:21.384
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:22.933
to feel shy about it.

00:24:23.047 --> 00:24:27.690
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

00:24:27.715 --> 00:24:31.771
But here we dare not have any procession.

00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:36.836
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:38.122
a procession.

00:24:38.147 --> 00:24:41.438
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:46.179
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

00:24:46.204 --> 00:24:51.891
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:53.834
to announce, then you are.

00:24:53.859 --> 00:25:00.021
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:04.672
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

00:25:04.697 --> 00:25:05.697
about it.

00:25:05.783 --> 00:25:11.271
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

00:25:11.271 --> 00:25:15.203
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

00:25:15.228 --> 00:25:22.221
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:23.801
guilty about everything.

00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:28.041
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:30.401
That's the trouble.

00:25:30.401 --> 00:25:32.971
Think of it positively.

00:25:32.971 --> 00:25:37.661
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

00:25:37.661 --> 00:25:43.121
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

00:25:43.121 --> 00:25:45.451
have gone further."

00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:51.661
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:57.041
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

00:25:57.041 --> 00:25:58.041
destiny?

00:25:58.699 --> 00:26:01.389
What have you to become?

00:26:01.532 --> 00:26:06.281
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

00:26:06.281 --> 00:26:10.820
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:16.632
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

00:26:16.632 --> 00:26:23.771
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

00:26:23.771 --> 00:26:26.015
can create so many things - it's true.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.180
But, that is not your destiny.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.310
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.861
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

00:26:38.861 --> 00:26:42.521
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:47.791
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:52.300
only a few people were there putting the posters.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:27:01.741
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:05.891
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

00:27:05.891 --> 00:27:08.200
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:13.881
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

00:27:13.881 --> 00:27:17.430
my, my, my, my that, my that."

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.221
So they live in an island.

00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:24.591
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:27.761
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

00:27:27.761 --> 00:27:28.981
Then they feel guilty.

00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.781
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:45.161
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

00:27:45.161 --> 00:27:46.871
of the whole of humanity.

00:27:46.871 --> 00:27:54.550
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:28:02.995
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.020
way.

00:28:04.173 --> 00:28:07.141
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:14.810
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:20.930
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.631
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:28.596
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

00:28:28.627 --> 00:28:34.531
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:36.981
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:39.548
They don't have to possess anyone.

00:28:39.573 --> 00:28:44.571
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

00:28:44.571 --> 00:28:48.351
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:56.667
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

00:28:56.692 --> 00:29:02.950
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:04.923
parcel of the whole.

00:29:04.948 --> 00:29:10.652
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

00:29:10.677 --> 00:29:15.471
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:22.721
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:26.831
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:30.449
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

00:29:30.474 --> 00:29:32.411
We are all one.

00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:34.734
So what is there to say sorry?

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:37.719
There is no foreigner within us.

00:29:37.744 --> 00:29:44.433
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:45.458
or anything.

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:51.903
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

00:29:51.903 --> 00:29:57.493
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

00:29:57.493 --> 00:30:01.353
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

00:30:01.353 --> 00:30:04.773
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

00:30:04.773 --> 00:30:07.192
They are part and parcel of My being.

00:30:07.192 --> 00:30:09.933
So why should I send this to them?

00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:12.383
But I can nourish them.

00:30:12.383 --> 00:30:17.582
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:22.873
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

00:30:22.873 --> 00:30:27.773
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:32.113
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

00:30:32.113 --> 00:30:33.113
Think about it.

00:30:33.113 --> 00:30:37.192
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

00:30:37.192 --> 00:30:38.493
It is sometimes so.

00:30:38.493 --> 00:30:48.273
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

00:30:48.273 --> 00:30:53.973
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

00:30:53.973 --> 00:30:55.883
they started the song.

00:30:55.883 --> 00:31:01.533
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:03.903
that I like this song."

00:31:03.903 --> 00:31:09.733
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

00:31:09.733 --> 00:31:12.302
also pleasing other people.

00:31:12.327 --> 00:31:14.337
The example of that is like this.

00:31:14.337 --> 00:31:18.247
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

00:31:18.247 --> 00:31:23.423
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

00:31:23.423 --> 00:31:28.787
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:29.946
mozzarella cheese.

00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:34.027
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

00:31:34.027 --> 00:31:39.356
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:42.659
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

00:31:42.684 --> 00:31:46.027
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

00:31:46.027 --> 00:31:47.027
"Eh, you have a choice?"

00:31:47.027 --> 00:31:48.917
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

00:31:48.917 --> 00:31:51.926
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

00:31:51.965 --> 00:31:55.927
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

00:31:55.927 --> 00:32:06.927
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

00:32:06.927 --> 00:32:10.506
So this kind of understanding shows what?

00:32:10.506 --> 00:32:15.957
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

00:32:15.957 --> 00:32:18.807
You have not seen Me.

00:32:18.807 --> 00:32:24.337
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

00:32:24.337 --> 00:32:26.055
mozzarella, mozzarella.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:32.277
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

00:32:32.277 --> 00:32:37.427
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

00:32:37.427 --> 00:32:43.767
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:44.767
no choice of anything.

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:50.707
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:54.626
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

00:32:54.626 --> 00:32:56.986
I don't make fuss about things.

00:32:56.986 --> 00:33:04.067
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:05.616
that they are not collective.

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:07.787
Collective is to understand Me fully.

00:33:07.787 --> 00:33:14.376
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

00:33:14.376 --> 00:33:15.647
They all know about it.

00:33:15.647 --> 00:33:17.637
They know about the whole body.

00:33:17.637 --> 00:33:20.006
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

00:33:20.006 --> 00:33:26.157
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

00:33:26.157 --> 00:33:28.876
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

00:33:28.876 --> 00:33:35.537
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

00:33:35.537 --> 00:33:37.506
thousand names of the Goddess.

00:33:37.506 --> 00:33:43.697
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

00:33:43.697 --> 00:33:48.767
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:51.543
She can finish people.

00:33:51.568 --> 00:33:54.617
She's absolutely wrathful.

00:33:54.642 --> 00:33:55.897
It's true, I accept, it is so.

00:33:55.897 --> 00:33:58.797
But it is so, so it is so.

00:33:58.797 --> 00:34:02.767
But you must understand My in full ways.

00:34:02.767 --> 00:34:08.167
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

00:34:08.167 --> 00:34:14.817
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:19.616
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

00:34:19.616 --> 00:34:26.837
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

00:34:26.837 --> 00:34:29.267
So the other side will definitely punish you.

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:38.277
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

00:34:38.277 --> 00:34:39.928
understood properly.

00:34:40.094 --> 00:34:44.266
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

00:34:44.266 --> 00:34:48.257
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

00:34:48.257 --> 00:34:53.186
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

00:34:53.186 --> 00:34:57.716
Try to understand the essence of everything.

00:34:57.716 --> 00:35:01.056
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

00:35:01.056 --> 00:35:04.246
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:15.703
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

00:35:15.743 --> 00:35:18.053
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

00:35:18.053 --> 00:35:20.594
We don't have to judge it mentally.

00:35:20.594 --> 00:35:24.293
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

00:35:24.293 --> 00:35:25.293
What is the need?

00:35:25.293 --> 00:35:26.913
Ten minutes is sufficient.

00:35:26.913 --> 00:35:31.613
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

00:35:31.613 --> 00:35:37.553
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

00:35:37.553 --> 00:35:43.254
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

00:35:43.254 --> 00:35:48.423
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

00:35:48.423 --> 00:35:53.244
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

00:35:53.244 --> 00:35:57.494
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

00:35:57.494 --> 00:35:58.944
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:58.944 --> 00:36:04.573
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

00:36:04.573 --> 00:36:11.903
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:14.833
maximum love.

00:36:14.833 --> 00:36:18.403
So many there are ways of handling things.

00:36:18.403 --> 00:36:25.734
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

00:36:25.734 --> 00:36:32.363
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

00:36:32.363 --> 00:36:35.613
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

00:36:35.613 --> 00:36:38.393
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

00:36:38.393 --> 00:36:44.964
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

00:36:44.964 --> 00:36:52.024
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

00:36:52.024 --> 00:36:58.694
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

00:36:58.694 --> 00:37:00.954
You are not facing it.

00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:04.304
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

00:37:04.304 --> 00:37:10.194
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:14.714
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

00:37:14.714 --> 00:37:23.044
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

00:37:23.044 --> 00:37:25.883
Because that is the essence.

00:37:25.883 --> 00:37:30.964
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

00:37:30.964 --> 00:37:36.014
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

00:37:36.014 --> 00:37:38.484
mantras, they are not effective.

00:37:38.484 --> 00:37:47.923
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

00:37:47.923 --> 00:37:50.264
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

00:37:50.264 --> 00:37:56.264
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

00:37:56.264 --> 00:38:05.142
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

00:38:05.167 --> 00:38:06.374
It has the full effect.

00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:44.392
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

00:38:44.417 --> 00:38:51.427
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

00:38:51.427 --> 00:38:52.427
bad.

00:38:52.427 --> 00:38:55.336
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

00:38:55.336 --> 00:38:56.356
You will do it.

00:38:56.356 --> 00:38:58.887
You will hurt others.

00:38:58.887 --> 00:38:59.887
You will torture others.

00:38:59.887 --> 00:39:00.887
You will take advantage of them.

00:39:00.887 --> 00:39:03.756
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

00:39:03.756 --> 00:39:08.627
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

00:39:08.627 --> 00:39:13.927
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

00:39:13.927 --> 00:39:20.606
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

00:39:20.606 --> 00:39:26.667
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:36.956
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

00:39:36.956 --> 00:39:39.917
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

00:39:39.917 --> 00:39:44.947
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

00:39:44.947 --> 00:39:49.377
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

00:39:49.377 --> 00:39:54.346
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

00:39:54.346 --> 00:39:56.233
come and correct the sister.

00:39:56.258 --> 00:40:02.238
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

00:40:02.238 --> 00:40:04.839
relationship that you could think of.

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:10.698
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

00:40:10.698 --> 00:40:16.118
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

00:40:16.118 --> 00:40:22.028
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

00:40:22.028 --> 00:40:25.468
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

00:40:25.468 --> 00:40:31.458
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:31.458 --> 00:40:37.768
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.408
it as a guilt.

00:40:39.408 --> 00:40:42.449
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

00:40:42.449 --> 00:40:48.278
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

00:40:48.278 --> 00:40:53.349
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:59.829
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:10.629
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

00:41:10.629 --> 00:41:17.748
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

00:41:17.748 --> 00:41:23.158
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

00:41:23.158 --> 00:41:31.958
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

00:41:31.958 --> 00:41:32.958
pleasure.

00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:38.419
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

00:41:38.419 --> 00:41:42.478
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

00:41:42.478 --> 00:41:43.628
sister, doesn't matter.

00:41:43.628 --> 00:41:50.198
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

00:41:50.198 --> 00:41:55.099
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

00:41:55.099 --> 00:41:59.468
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

00:41:59.468 --> 00:42:01.199
the sisters.

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:07.448
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

00:42:07.448 --> 00:42:10.615
open - there should be no formality in it.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.546
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:19.688
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

00:42:19.688 --> 00:42:22.252
But it can be the other way around.

00:42:22.277 --> 00:42:27.827
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

00:42:27.827 --> 00:42:31.597
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

00:42:31.597 --> 00:42:32.737
So what?

00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:35.638
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

00:42:35.638 --> 00:42:38.853
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

00:42:38.878 --> 00:42:39.933
Finished.

00:42:39.958 --> 00:42:41.528
That's broken long time back.

00:42:41.553 --> 00:42:44.768
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

00:42:44.793 --> 00:42:50.158
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

00:42:50.158 --> 00:42:55.148
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

00:42:55.148 --> 00:43:01.567
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

00:43:01.567 --> 00:43:11.268
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:14.499
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:18.477
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

00:43:18.477 --> 00:43:21.997
That's why the discretion stands in between.

00:43:21.997 --> 00:43:26.047
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

00:43:26.047 --> 00:43:27.334
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

00:43:27.359 --> 00:43:29.947
That discretion is in between.

00:43:29.947 --> 00:43:37.067
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

00:43:37.067 --> 00:43:43.297
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:43.297 --> 00:43:47.947
Other than that it doesn't exist.

00:43:47.947 --> 00:43:52.607
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:52.632 --> 00:44:01.535
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:09.047
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

00:44:09.072 --> 00:44:11.513
May God Bless you!
