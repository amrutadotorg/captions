00:02.436 --> 00:15.010
The Nabhi chakra, is placed at the centre
of gravity, of every human being.

00:16.114 --> 00:20.738
If it is not there,

00:25.233 --> 00:31.532
that means it is going to be a little problem,

00:36.470 --> 00:41.679
for you to get it in its right place.

00:43.607 --> 00:56.712
There is a kind of a trouble which most of you suffer from,

00:59.783 --> 01:09.362
is maybe due to drugs or maybe nervous problems, due to war,

01:09.712 --> 01:16.783
or maybe some sort of a shock to your sustenance.

01:30.034 --> 01:40.527
For example, during war, people lost their values,

01:41.495 --> 01:47.870
because, they lost faith in God.

01:56.528 --> 02:09.410
Chaste women who believed in chastity,
were brutally assaulted.

02:19.349 --> 02:25.671
Very religious people, were persecuted,

02:30.552 --> 02:35.208
families were broken,

02:39.502 --> 02:43.899
many men were killed,

02:45.422 --> 02:56.863
and children, women, and old people, were scattered.

03:02.895 --> 03:08.510
A very horrible atmosphere of insecurity,

03:13.919 --> 03:17.735
overpowered all these nations.

03:22.918 --> 03:27.102
Then came the concentration camps, you see, also,

03:30.610 --> 03:37.283
which shattered human beings,

03:39.842 --> 03:47.581
because human beings are very delicate instruments.

03:52.263 --> 04:00.411
They are the coveted creations, they are the highest

04:03.828 --> 04:11.597
and they were dominated by things like bombs,
which are matter.

04:21.841 --> 04:30.875
Thus, the Spirit in man, died out.

04:35.958 --> 04:43.573
People lost faith in righteousness, in love.

04:54.210 --> 05:00.459
Then a new pattern of securities were built up.

05:07.078 --> 05:13.935
The industrial revolution followed it, as a result

05:23.689 --> 05:32.580
and the artificial sense of joy, of security, of love,

05:35.223 --> 05:39.706
was accepted by the society.

05:46.775 --> 05:50.184
This is what man did with his freedom,

05:50.644 --> 05:58.506
because wars are created by man, this is not Godâ€™s doing.

06:13.020 --> 06:23.845
But along with it, very great seeking souls,
took their birth on this Earth.

06:37.004 --> 06:51.043
They started seeking beyond these artificial
securities, like materialism.

07:08.377 --> 07:13.589
The seekers had no proper leaders,

07:17.581 --> 07:22.114
to organize them,

07:25.566 --> 07:28.788
and to lead them to the right path.

07:30.599 --> 07:45.999
So the mistakes committed by them,
created a hurdle.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.432
So, apart from the hurdles of human awareness,

07:58.655 --> 08:02.940
so many other hurdles were added.

08:07.551 --> 08:16.907
So many other hurdles were added,
which made Sahaja Yoga a difficult process for them.

08:39.432 --> 08:49.982
The countries who took part in the war, only
became the developed countries.

08:50.704 --> 08:55.149
As a reaction, no its a reaction, they are
the only developed people,

08:56.151 --> 09:01.847
who are actually taking part in the war.

09:02.071 --> 09:06.870
And those who did not, are underdeveloped.

09:18.714 --> 09:30.208
So, on one side, we have countries,
who are trying to seek,

09:30.922 --> 09:39.443
because they are overdeveloped, because they are affluent,

09:44.982 --> 09:51.280
but their seekers have lost their moorings,

09:56.454 --> 10:01.660
because of anti-feeling.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.168
Alright?

10:13.985 --> 10:18.305
While other countries are not yet developed,

10:19.846 --> 10:27.305
so the seekers there, are still seeking in money.

10:42.853 --> 10:50.819
At this juncture, Sahaja Yoga was found out, this was the stage

11:01.591 --> 11:12.013
by which the promised union of human awareness with God is established,

11:19.380 --> 11:24.025
through which you feel your unconscious,

11:29.170 --> 11:35.163
the Power of God, which is All-pervading,

11:36.963 --> 11:42.933
which thinks, organizes, and plans.

11:56.870 --> 12:00.012
Only through Kundalini Yoga of Sahaja,

12:00.132 --> 12:04.989
Sahaja Kundalini Yoga, only through Sahaja Kundalini Yoga,

12:05.314 --> 12:10.634
human beings are going to evolve.

12:21.809 --> 12:25.839
But those who are going to evolve,

12:29.205 --> 12:33.213
have to have their dharma intact.
