1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:01,190
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

2
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,631
Today we are going to have a  puja of Fatimabi,

3
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:22,156
who was the symbol of Gruhalakshmi,

4
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,898
and so we are going to have the puja

5
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,529
of the Gruhalakshmi principle within us.

6
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,868
As the housewife has to finish every work,

7
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,873
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

8
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,473
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

9
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,771
and then I could come for your puja,

10
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,918
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

11
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:54,817
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

12
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:03,112
Now, the principle of Gruhalakshmi

13
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:09,183
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

14
00:04:09,295 --> 00:04:12,900
it’s not a human being’s creation

15
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:19,519
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

16
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:28,757
The Gruhalakshmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

17
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,358
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

18
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:40,220
Now She is always born in a relationship

19
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:49,886
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

20
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,856
So She comes as sister or

21
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:57,272
She comes as a daughter.

22
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,381
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

23
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:08,267
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

24
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:14,940
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

25
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:19,280
the religion into their hands

26
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:23,110
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

27
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,321
The attention was not paid so much

28
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:30,625
towards the ascent of the person.

29
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:35,971
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

30
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:38,614
And He is the only one -

31
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:42,900
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

32
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:47,168
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

33
00:05:47,232 --> 00:05:49,485
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

34
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:54,784
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
 [brother of Jnaneshwara],

35
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:58,276
which, you can go to Pune,

36
00:05:58,356 --> 00:06:00,339
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

37
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:38,806
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

38
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:44,837
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

39
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:52,791
She stayed in her house, in her household

40
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:57,352
and She observed what you call

41
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:01,735
a kind of a panda
 [? Pata: veil]

42
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:06,723
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

43
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,727
It is a symbol that a woman

44
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:16,588
who is a housewife has to

45
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:27,488
save her chastity by covering her face because

46
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,173
She was a beautiful woman and

47
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:38,857
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

48
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:42,799
and She would have been definitely attacked

49
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:47,334
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

50
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:50,450
As you know, in the time of Christ,

51
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:55,048
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

52
00:07:55,398 --> 00:07:58,640
had to be very, very potential personality

53
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:03,192
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

54
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:09,557
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

55
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:16,373
so She allowed her sons

56
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:19,512
or actually ordered them

57
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:23,025
to fight those fanatics

58
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:28,960
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

59
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:34,036
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

60
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,738
It’s a very beautiful thing how

61
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:41,244
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

62
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:45,358
took a form of Vishnumaya

63
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:54,770
just to establish the beautiful principle of

64
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,469
a housewife.

65
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:06,449
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

66
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:10,256
and She knew that her children will be killed.

67
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:15,668
But these people are never killed,

68
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:19,083
they never die nor do they suffer.

69
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,745
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

70
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:26,867
As a result of that,

71
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:34,359
another system started where they respected saints;

72
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:40,540
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

73
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,276
or we can call them the people

74
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:46,421
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

75
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:50,845
Then we have got “Chisti”.

76
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:57,099
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

77
00:09:57,522 --> 00:10:01,055
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

78
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:05,790
But still they could not transcend

79
00:10:06,213 --> 00:10:12,512
the limits of religiosity.

80
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,279
So they also became extremely fanatic.

81
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:23,101
Firstly they would not see to

82
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:27,320
another religion where they had saints.

83
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:31,731
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

84
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:38,681
and even when we had a great saint

85
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:44,441
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

86
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:51,380
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

87
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:55,779
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

88
00:10:57,212 --> 00:11:01,721
We did not deny,

89
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:04,496
as far as Hindus were concerned,

90
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:10,326
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

91
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,791
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

92
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,984
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

93
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:23,904
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

94
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,837
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

95
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,522
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

96
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:34,273
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

97
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:41,514
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

98
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:46,531
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

99
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,853
So they could not get out of it.

100
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:52,293
So we have another one called Haji Malang

101
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:56,041
who was worshipped by Hindus.

102
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:59,680
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

103
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,798
This Haji Malang

104
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:10,062
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

105
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:14,480
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

106
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,039
just to counter balance.

107
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:19,295
They did all kinds of things.

108
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,338
There are many saints like that.

109
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:29,447
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

110
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:35,676
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

111
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,287
of that place, which was very bad. Even

112
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:43,440
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

113
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,094
They all make an earnings,

114
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:49,691
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

115
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:56,836
So this saint died and was buried there.

116
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:59,491
There were many people who were depending on it.

117
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,142
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

118
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,312
 'What is your religion?'

119
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:08,714
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

120
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:12,319
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

121
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:15,203
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

122
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,432
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

123
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,535
They have no religions.

124
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,610
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

125
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:32,474
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

126
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,004
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

127
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,792
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

128
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:42,511
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

129
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,276
that they made a fanatic group.

130
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:50,461
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

131
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:54,707
against your innate religion within your-self

132
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:57,564
because it creates poison.

133
00:13:59,292 --> 00:14:01,443
It's a venomous thing.

134
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,866
It makes you hate others.

135
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,935
When you start hating others,

136
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,985
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

137
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:16,721
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

138
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:22,777
Hating any one

139
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,970
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

140
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:30,472
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

141
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:33,295
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

142
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:35,956
They bite some one because that is their nature.

143
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:38,730
They cut some one because that's their nature.

144
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:40,954
They never hate someone.

145
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,902
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

146
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:50,272
is a speciality of human conception

147
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,982
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

148
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,331
And this horrible thing hatred

149
00:15:00,562 --> 00:15:04,508
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

150
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:09,427
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

151
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,750
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

152
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:17,221
in every religion.

153
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:21,608
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

154
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:27,587
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

155
00:15:28,383 --> 00:15:33,670
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

156
00:15:34,382 --> 00:15:39,510
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

157
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:44,189
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

158
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,572
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

159
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,405
to overcome that hatred,

160
00:15:55,874 --> 00:16:00,823
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

161
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,780
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

162
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:09,164
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

163
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:15,393
How? In the family when you have a household,

164
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:24,705
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

165
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:31,657
between the children, between the husband and the children.

166
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:36,901
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

167
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:40,486
then how can she subdue it?

168
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:45,704
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

169
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:48,906
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

170
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,940
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

171
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,606
But the housewife's job is to smooth

172
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,988
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

173
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:12,575
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

174
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:16,466
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

175
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:19,930
'wherever the housewife is respected,

176
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:23,506
there only the Gods reside'.

177
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:30,552
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

178
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,978
because we are no good for economics,

179
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,004
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

180
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,809
Men folk are useless,

181
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,755
they don't know any household work or anything,

182
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:45,311
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

183
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:47,984
 is maintained by the women of the household.

184
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:55,157
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

185
00:17:56,748 --> 00:18:00,696
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

186
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:04,191
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

187
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:10,112
It's like the preservation of that

188
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:16,934
principle of a housewife.

189
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,100
But some men, I mean many of them,

190
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:26,771
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

191
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:31,172
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

192
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:35,780
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

193
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,041
 But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

194
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,980
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

195
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,117
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

196
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:51,218
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

197
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,349
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

198
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,608
 [you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

199
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,897
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

200
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,289
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

201
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,714
they have no love or respect for each other

202
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,788
but they have an awe or fear.

203
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,642
And they are afraid of such a woman.

204
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:20,795
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
 the husbands are better controlled.

205
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,215
But their basic principle they lose.

206
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:29,702
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

207
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,597
and they land up in difficulties.

208
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:39,468
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

209
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,041
 is to respect her chastity,

210
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:48,445
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

211
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:52,189
That is the steadiness of her.

212
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,324
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

213
00:19:56,121 --> 00:20:00,775
If the wife is docile or obedient,

214
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:06,752
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
 Alright!

215
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:12,701
 But this woman, the housewife,

216
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:17,500
has to know that she is not docile.

217
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:23,109
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

218
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,140
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

219
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,455
If the husband is stupid, alright,

220
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,116
he's stupid like a child, finished!

221
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,779
But the husband has to know that he must

222
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,035
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

223
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:46,116
he's good for nothing.

224
00:20:48,427 --> 00:20:50,894
First thing is that he must see

225
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:55,802
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

226
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,545
Then the blessings flow.

227
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:04,343
But in no way he should insult her

228
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,773
 or be unkind to her

229
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,251
 and raise his voice or say things to her.

230
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:16,841
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

231
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:20,353
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

232
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:23,972
 give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

233
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,473
She has not to be dominating,

234
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,737
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

235
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:34,862
She is the source of peace,

236
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:39,161
she is the source of joy

237
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,981
and she is the peacemaker.

238
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,642
If she is the one who creates problems,

239
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,987
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

240
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:55,622
 So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

241
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,555
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

242
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:06,053
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

243
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,159
your left Nabhi can never improve.

244
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,858
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

245
00:22:18,776 --> 00:22:21,910
 Now in the west the problem with women

246
00:22:22,026 --> 00:22:26,351
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

247
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:34,742
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

248
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:40,342
 They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

249
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:43,220
They are the queen of the house

250
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:47,128
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

251
00:22:47,414 --> 00:22:49,414
young frivolous girl.

252
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,206
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

253
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:58,434
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

254
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:03,408
that, does not behove a housewife.

255
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,252
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

256
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,454
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

257
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,632
and when they have to fight.

258
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:17,153
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

259
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:21,386
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
 that's the limit!

260
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:28,688
 They start always comparing themselves

261
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:31,312
with the husband, to begin with.

262
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:36,084
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

263
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,769
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

264
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,314
low family he has no money,

265
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:44,959
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

266
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:47,940
 Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

267
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:51,998
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

268
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:59,093
Also in her own ways

269
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,207
she will feel guilty,

270
00:24:01,835 --> 00:24:05,464
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

271
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:09,610
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

272
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:17,334
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

273
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:22,012
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

274
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:26,338
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

275
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,854
by your strength, by everything

276
00:24:32,224 --> 00:24:36,314
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

277
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:42,829
by dominating others, by strangling others,

278
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:47,421
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

279
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:53,286
frog in the well.

280
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:58,269
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

281
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,976
Lets have our house separately,

282
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:03,169
nobody should come in the house'.
 Even a rat won't enter that house.

283
00:25:05,302 --> 00:25:10,301
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

284
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:16,007
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

285
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:19,567
is the negative form of understanding.

286
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:23,928
These are absolutely absurd things,

287
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,620
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

288
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:33,085
 All this kind of selfishness,

289
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:38,143
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:43,499
But a thing of a housewife is,

291
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:47,128
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

292
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,173
 For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

293
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:53,794
 So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

294
00:25:53,921 --> 00:25:56,254
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

295
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:59,254
 'But may be they would like to eat more.'

296
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,091
 'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

297
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,077
 'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

298
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:09,130
So she thinks of her generosity.

299
00:26:09,424 --> 00:26:11,108
She enjoys her generosity.

300
00:26:11,775 --> 00:26:13,259
I have known many like that.

301
00:26:13,394 --> 00:26:16,298
 Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

302
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:20,842
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

303
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:22,818
 will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

304
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,096
 you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

305
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:28,013
 No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

306
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,192
Then she just start thinking immediately.

307
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:33,251
'What vegetables are available in the market?

308
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,658
What should I get? What is the best?'

309
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:40,665
 I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

310
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:43,086
I am just a relation,

311
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:47,066
but they want to express their love through the food,

312
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:52,118
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

313
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:56,036
and this is one of  the quality,

314
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:58,536
 the generosity for woman doesn't have

315
00:26:58,888 --> 00:27:02,136
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

316
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:07,397
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

317
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:12,245
but wife has to be very generous

318
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:15,054
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

319
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:19,536
not to her own children but to others.

320
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:25,861
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:29,850
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

322
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:34,742
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:40,447
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

324
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:45,794
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

325
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:52,524
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

326
00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:57,266
 but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

327
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:02,781
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

328
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,302
about your own understanding.

329
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,041
You are not aware of yourself.

330
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:14,800
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

331
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:19,146
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

332
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,820
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

333
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:26,685
  Alright, leave it for a while.

334
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:29,049
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

335
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:31,970
 'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

336
00:28:33,856 --> 00:28:36,739
The women must understand the men.

337
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:40,804
 They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

338
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,603
They see everything in a big way, you see.

339
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:49,130
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

340
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,076
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

341
00:28:52,195 --> 00:28:54,036
They are too above these things.

342
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:58,323
They are above these things. You must understand that!

343
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:04,202
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

344
00:29:04,936 --> 00:29:07,785
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

345
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:11,940
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

346
00:29:13,914 --> 00:29:15,993
It is coming to that point.

347
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:19,148
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

348
00:29:19,283 --> 00:29:22,293
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

349
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:24,970
without any moustaches.

350
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:32,796
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

351
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,712
But there is no subordination of any kind.

352
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,158
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

353
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:41,597
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

354
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,499
and, above all, to your righteousness

355
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:48,947
 because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

356
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:53,016
has to look after that side.

357
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,242
How many quarrels you create?

358
00:29:56,394 --> 00:30:00,834
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

359
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,653
Supposing we send two peacemakers

360
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:07,587
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

361
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,042
what will you say to such a thing?

362
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:16,032
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

363
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:21,553
you have  the one who has to bring such

364
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:26,893
expression of love, such sweet things

365
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:35,910
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

366
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:38,428
because you are the mother.

367
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,558
The family must feel secured within you

368
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:45,801
 and this love is your power.

369
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:50,903
 This is your power that you can give love

370
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:55,781
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

371
00:30:57,199 --> 00:31:00,691
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

372
00:31:00,794 --> 00:31:03,191
 I don't know I'll have to build another house!

373
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:05,629
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

374
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:07,518
 I will not take any individual presents."

375
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:10,226
Now still despite that. I don't know,

376
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:16,109
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

377
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:21,528
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

378
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:23,752
You are some times surprised.

379
00:31:26,013 --> 00:31:29,735
 I'll give you one simple example of my own life

380
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,445
which will tell you how love can work it out.

381
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:37,385
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

382
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:40,342
And once I was in Delhi,

383
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:45,481
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

384
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:47,049
sitting outside in the lawn,

385
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:51,156
 when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

386
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:53,826
and they came and said, "See now we are...

387
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:57,447
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

388
00:31:57,566 --> 00:32:00,237
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

389
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:01,636
and he is a Muslim,

390
00:32:01,811 --> 00:32:05,042
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

391
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,843
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

392
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,153
 they were quite alright.

393
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,748
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

394
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:15,189
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

395
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:17,374
and a bathroom and this thing,

396
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:20,021
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

397
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,410
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

398
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:25,788
In the evening my brother came in.

399
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,788
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

400
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:28,957
he said "What is this?

401
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:31,243
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

402
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:35,485
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

403
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:37,373
my husband came, he also joined him

404
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:40,746
 because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

405
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:43,766
All men just the same, you see,

406
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:46,000
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

407
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,033
she has kept these three persons here.

408
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,138
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

409
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,642
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

410
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:56,970
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

411
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:58,599
all kind of things.

412
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:02,183
Next morning they forgot about that.

413
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:05,622
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

414
00:33:06,162 --> 00:33:08,109
I can't drag them out today, one night."

415
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:10,708
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

416
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:12,130
That's like men!

417
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:14,194
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

418
00:33:14,313 --> 00:33:17,690
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

419
00:33:18,016 --> 00:33:20,850
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

420
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:23,879
Next morning they went away for their work.

421
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:26,577
 They had no time. It was, you see,

422
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:30,206
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

423
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:33,550
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

424
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:38,101
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

425
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,647
Then this lady got a job

426
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:48,185
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

427
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:53,020
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

428
00:33:53,449 --> 00:34:00,241
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

429
00:34:00,702 --> 00:34:02,507
It had a reflection in Delhi

430
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:04,920
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

431
00:34:05,353 --> 00:34:09,274
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

432
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,064
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

433
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,209
I said, "No. How can I have?"

434
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,864
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

435
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:21,049
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

436
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,561
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

437
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:27,945
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

438
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,469
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

439
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:37,025
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

440
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,691
because I will not allow you!"

441
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,953
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

442
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,940
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

443
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,985
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

444
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,652
 I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

445
00:34:51,104 --> 00:34:52,424
His life was saved.

446
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,397
 Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

447
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:58,532
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

448
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:03,015
and this lady became a great actress,

449
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:05,360
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

450
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:08,042
 the one who used to act like a mother?

451
00:35:09,516 --> 00:35:12,693
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

452
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:16,650
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

453
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:18,618
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

454
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,987
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

455
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:23,959
they will just go mad about Me,"

456
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,252
and I said "I have no time for all that."

457
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:31,401
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

458
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:32,706
to give them some good films.

459
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:35,485
But it all made into a farce, later on.

460
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:37,859
 They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

461
00:35:38,193 --> 00:35:42,631
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

462
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:44,629
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

463
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,851
 I have said, I have anything to do with it."

464
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:53,230
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

465
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,999
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

466
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:00,787
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

467
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:03,678
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

468
00:36:03,814 --> 00:36:05,172
You will have to give me Sari.

469
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,014
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

470
00:36:07,091 --> 00:36:09,022
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

471
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:10,865
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

472
00:36:10,977 --> 00:36:13,762
 big muhurat is the one where you start it.

473
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:17,858
 So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

474
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:20,117
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

475
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:21,905
 that she has seen Me after twelve years.

476
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,131
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

477
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:27,266
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

478
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,872
fell into my arms

479
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:33,837
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

480
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:35,990
I have been trying to trace you out."

481
00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:39,447
Then she started describing Me and all.

482
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,378
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

483
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:45,634
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

484
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:48,925
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

485
00:36:49,036 --> 00:36:50,726
we'll give our lives for Her!"

486
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:53,350
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

487
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:56,091
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

488
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:57,372
Nothing doing. "

489
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:58,601
 See now,

490
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:02,240
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

491
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,196
I didn't have so many rights on

492
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:09,980
my husband's property, or anything,

493
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,244
and my brother another dominating fellow,

494
00:37:12,474 --> 00:37:15,103
both of them put together,

495
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:17,740
just were about to kill me that night,

496
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:21,594
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

497
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,686
and then you know when I told my husband

498
00:37:24,806 --> 00:37:26,925
and my brother, they were amazed.

499
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:29,594
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

500
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,540
 and see the change,

501
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:34,306
how much they have...",

502
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:37,588
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

503
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:39,526
no to any charitable institution.

504
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:41,559
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

505
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:46,746
And the whole idea of a...

506
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:51,846
earning and money just toppled down.

507
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,364
And she has acted in many films for charity

508
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,704
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

509
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,259
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

510
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,574
because she herself is charitable.

511
00:38:12,352 --> 00:38:14,989
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

512
00:38:16,272 --> 00:38:18,557
And she can create beauty around her,

513
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:22,800
in her household, in her family, in her society.

514
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,803
Everywhere. But no!

515
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:28,424
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

516
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:33,708
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

517
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,581
 [UNCLEAR]

518
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,732
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

519
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:48,859
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

520
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,053
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

521
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:54,699
and that they have to be told.

522
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:57,202
But this is not the way!

523
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:03,220
 There is another way of improving these men, who try to

524
00:39:04,785 --> 00:39:06,037
destroy the women,

525
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:11,246
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

526
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:16,307
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

527
00:39:16,632 --> 00:39:19,549
He will never side with men if they are chaste

528
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:22,783
and do not try to show off their body

529
00:39:22,974 --> 00:39:25,616
 and show off their beauty and want to make,

530
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:28,153
sort of, a capital out of it.

531
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,961
Such women are extremely powerful,

532
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,983
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

533
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:40,787
when it comes to anything

534
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:44,448
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

535
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,347
She fought the British.

536
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:48,294
And the British also

537
00:39:48,715 --> 00:39:50,971
were surprised at her valour and they said that

538
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,695
we had got Jhansi, alright,

539
00:39:53,148 --> 00:39:55,984
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

540
00:39:59,086 --> 00:40:01,514
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

541
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:05,231
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

542
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,813
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

543
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:12,733
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

544
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,330
who have been great women, who were housewives.

545
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:26,475
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

546
00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:28,266
or potential of any energy.

547
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:31,314
 Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

548
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:33,769
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

549
00:40:34,047 --> 00:40:37,248
 one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

550
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:40,485
So one has to understand that we are potential

551
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,630
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

552
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:47,696
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

553
00:40:47,943 --> 00:40:51,527
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

554
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,934
 But men are another stupid stuff

555
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,025
because they will not respect a woman

556
00:40:57,223 --> 00:40:59,797
who loves them, who is chaste,

557
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,165
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

558
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,320
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

559
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:09,942
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

560
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:13,382
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

561
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:17,594
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

562
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:21,805
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

563
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:29,606
 What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

564
00:41:30,527 --> 00:41:32,807
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

565
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:34,541
that the way they get attracted.

566
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:37,934
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

567
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,348
women become very insecure

568
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,336
and they get insecured. As a result,

569
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,133
the men suffer and women suffer.

570
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:50,779
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

571
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:56,228
will consequently get blood cancer.

572
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,447
And the woman who behaves like this,

573
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:13,352
in this manner and if she ill-treats

574
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:17,117
her husband, will get asthma

575
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:23,124
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

576
00:42:25,653 --> 00:42:29,097
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

577
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:33,715
could be complete dehydration of the body.

578
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:41,588
Because left nabhi is so important.

579
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:46,024
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

580
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:50,891
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

581
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:55,633
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

582
00:42:56,097 --> 00:42:57,624
I have always seen

583
00:42:57,878 --> 00:43:02,171
 that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

584
00:43:04,272 --> 00:43:06,830
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

585
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:09,332
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

586
00:43:09,396 --> 00:43:11,953
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

587
00:43:12,141 --> 00:43:14,479
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

588
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,674
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

589
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:23,068
He gets something for the jumping

590
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,000
and she gets something for her torturing.

591
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:31,989
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

592
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:38,030
This so-called figure madness,

593
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:41,802
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

594
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:47,132
 It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

595
00:43:50,282 --> 00:43:52,900
Women have to be settled down women.

596
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,144
They have to be Grahasthis,

597
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:58,867
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

598
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:01,505
 Said to be satisfied with her household.

599
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:03,938
If she is all the time running about,

600
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,622
 she doesn't want to stay in the house

601
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,935
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

602
00:44:12,364 --> 00:44:17,142
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

603
00:44:17,372 --> 00:44:19,557
and then she was made a housewife

604
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,973
but she could not stop her running about

605
00:44:22,164 --> 00:44:24,069
because she was a maid servant.

606
00:44:25,947 --> 00:44:27,862
She doesn't settle in the household.

607
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,039
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

608
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:35,511
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

609
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:37,929
but for others to welcome.

610
00:44:38,628 --> 00:44:41,647
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

611
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:44,091
 to come and sit and enjoy.

612
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:47,651
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

613
00:44:47,762 --> 00:44:50,558
we find that people, after marriage,

614
00:44:50,694 --> 00:44:54,959
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

615
00:44:56,449 --> 00:45:00,101
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

616
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:03,619
and disobedient, torturesome.

617
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:08,835
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

618
00:45:10,423 --> 00:45:11,943
Not that I punish this,

619
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:14,487
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

620
00:45:14,596 --> 00:45:17,538
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

621
00:45:17,777 --> 00:45:20,792
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

622
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:26,352
Then children become funny.

623
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,462
 Just for your family, just for your food,

624
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:34,090
just for your household, this selfishness,

625
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:38,496
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

626
00:45:38,713 --> 00:45:41,640
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

627
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:44,612
but if the man is a gone case,

628
00:45:48,264 --> 00:45:50,614
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

629
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:54,105
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

630
00:45:55,526 --> 00:46:00,127
Our family is not of one man one woman

631
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,983
but the whole universe is our family.

632
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,735
We are not on our own,

633
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:11,861
 and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

634
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,372
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

635
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,416
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

636
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:20,218
a day will come,

637
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,949
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

638
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:30,791
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

639
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:33,813
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

640
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:40,966
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

641
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,947
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

642
00:46:45,064 --> 00:46:46,290
group of women,

643
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:50,598
 she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

644
00:46:57,412 --> 00:47:00,175
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

645
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:03,939
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

646
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:07,712
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

647
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:14,937
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

648
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:18,377
Not because it is a punishment from God.

649
00:47:22,033 --> 00:47:25,532
 So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

650
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:32,079
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

651
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:36,183
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

652
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:44,072
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

653
00:47:46,465 --> 00:47:49,452
Those women who have tried such tricks,

654
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:53,440
 should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

655
00:47:53,556 --> 00:47:55,632
Nobody respects such a woman.

656
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,348
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

657
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,946
The leader's wife or the leadership

658
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:11,620
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

659
00:48:12,342 --> 00:48:14,332
Most insignificant.

660
00:48:16,624 --> 00:48:20,606
What you got is much higher than this.

661
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:27,522
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

662
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:30,622
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

663
00:48:36,795 --> 00:48:38,533
Is the minimal of minimal.

664
00:48:38,886 --> 00:48:40,560
Is the lowest of lowest.

665
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:44,714
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

666
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:48,774
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

667
00:48:51,016 --> 00:48:54,053
But that service itself is enjoyment.

668
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:57,196
 But if you just keep to service.

669
00:48:57,435 --> 00:49:01,510
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

670
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:08,036
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

671
00:49:08,706 --> 00:49:10,841
You can be used for a cross!

672
00:49:16,008 --> 00:49:18,328
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

673
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:22,175
 unless and until you have that essence

674
00:49:22,302 --> 00:49:25,703
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

675
00:49:27,643 --> 00:49:32,658
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

676
00:49:33,856 --> 00:49:37,824
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

677
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:40,113
then what is left?

678
00:49:41,193 --> 00:49:44,315
In the same way, all the so-called service

679
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:46,793
and seva and tapasya

680
00:49:47,016 --> 00:49:50,280
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

681
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,350
So the essence of all this is sweetness

682
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,483
and that is generated by women.

683
00:50:01,522 --> 00:50:03,879
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

684
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,975
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

685
00:50:06,143 --> 00:50:09,526
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

686
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:18,479
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

687
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,676
It's a good thing in a way.

688
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:26,973
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

689
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,602
But to make him all the time slave,

690
00:50:33,721 --> 00:50:36,530
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

691
00:50:36,693 --> 00:50:38,914
Is not the job of a housewife!

692
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:48,157
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

693
00:50:49,395 --> 00:50:50,760
She gives you everything.

694
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:53,966
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

695
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:56,062
Such powers She has.

696
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:59,142
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

697
00:50:59,637 --> 00:51:03,305
 You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

698
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:07,126
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

699
00:51:07,352 --> 00:51:11,774
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

700
00:51:11,897 --> 00:51:14,484
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

701
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:16,281
Least expected!

702
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:20,150
Never in life-time.

703
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:23,439
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

704
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:25,732
First time, I said something and see the effect.

705
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,359
Because I've never said to him!

706
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:34,445
 So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

707
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:37,138
satisfied within herself because she has to give.

708
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:40,118
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

709
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,025
She has to give love because she is love.

710
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:46,045
She has to give all the services.

711
00:51:46,165 --> 00:51:48,087
She has to give all the possessions;

712
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,542
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

713
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:53,617
what a responsibility!

714
00:51:54,498 --> 00:51:57,715
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

715
00:51:57,885 --> 00:51:59,615
is the responsibility of a woman,

716
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,943
and she should feel proud of it,
 that such a responsibility has come to me.

717
00:52:03,674 --> 00:52:05,046
A housewife

718
00:52:05,198 --> 00:52:08,713
 has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,942
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

720
00:52:15,629 --> 00:52:17,668
because they think they have become leaders.

721
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:19,385
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

722
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:23,094
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

723
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,117
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

724
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:33,677
 I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

725
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:41,082
and each one of them adores Me.

726
00:52:41,614 --> 00:52:44,030
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

727
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:46,461
all of them will come from all over to see  me

728
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:49,662
but My husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

729
00:52:50,564 --> 00:52:54,757
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
 and they come and see me, not him!

730
00:52:57,446 --> 00:52:59,478
If I had not given them love,

731
00:52:59,613 --> 00:53:02,029
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

732
00:53:02,462 --> 00:53:04,343
they would have not come to Me.

733
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:09,920
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

734
00:53:10,218 --> 00:53:13,122
 They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

735
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,556
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

736
00:53:18,691 --> 00:53:20,321
many stupid women.

737
00:53:20,774 --> 00:53:24,172
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

738
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:29,305
Because they don't know what power they have got.

739
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:35,995
They don't know what responsibility they have.

740
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:39,999
 I'm an example before them.

741
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,898
 And this is the very big problem with Me that practically

742
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:51,384
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

743
00:53:51,576 --> 00:53:54,007
I must say, horrible.

744
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:59,076
And Sahajayoga goes dhap like that with them.

745
00:54:00,104 --> 00:54:02,024
They can't live in an ashram,

746
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,282
they will have their food,
 the husband must see that they have their food.

747
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:08,229
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

748
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:12,001
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

749
00:54:15,605 --> 00:54:19,065
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

750
00:54:19,216 --> 00:54:22,138
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

751
00:54:25,076 --> 00:54:26,313
But no, they sit down,

752
00:54:26,449 --> 00:54:29,250
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

753
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,634
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

754
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,629
Just do that! Do this!"

755
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:41,405
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

756
00:54:42,434 --> 00:54:46,187
Every wife of a leader

757
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:51,332
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

758
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:58,894
They have to cook. And with heart.

759
00:54:59,366 --> 00:55:03,460
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

760
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,490
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

761
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:11,920
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

762
00:55:12,195 --> 00:55:15,213
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

763
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:18,597
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

764
00:55:18,727 --> 00:55:20,925
encourage their niceness.

765
00:55:21,227 --> 00:55:23,683
 Also I have seen, some very good ladies

766
00:55:23,755 --> 00:55:26,637
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

767
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:27,998
After marriage they are lost.

768
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:31,267
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

769
00:55:33,465 --> 00:55:37,290
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
 otherwise they are not there.

770
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:42,113
Today I was asking Arneau,
he told Me so many of them are like that here.

771
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:45,841
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

772
00:55:47,249 --> 00:55:49,566
because before marriage they were better off.

773
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:55,723
 So how much it is important, a Gruhalakshmi Principle within us,

774
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:58,022
for us to be together,

775
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:01,475
to us to grow together, to feel the togetherness,

776
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:04,223
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

777
00:56:04,896 --> 00:56:08,364
 So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

778
00:56:08,523 --> 00:56:10,181
the Ragas we have.

779
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:12,226
Ra is energy.

780
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:16,866
Ga is in Sanskrit language ‘Ga - Geti’ (ग गेती )  means 'which penetrates',

781
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,366
'which moves into everything',

782
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:22,591
it's the etheric qualities,

783
00:56:23,478 --> 00:56:25,422
etheric, into which you see,

784
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:28,462
you put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

785
00:56:29,272 --> 00:56:33,719
 So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

786
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:37,684
and touches your spirit.

787
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:41,020
That is the Raga.

788
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:47,122
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

789
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:56,226
Supposing if you stand with a military band

790
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:59,906
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

791
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:05,841
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

792
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:10,901
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

793
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:15,755
 The way the housewife decorates the house,

794
00:57:16,211 --> 00:57:20,347
she smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

795
00:57:20,558 --> 00:57:22,503
then she's looking after everyone.

796
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:24,702
 Everybody knows she is standing there.

797
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:28,984
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

798
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:32,805
some people for birthday cake of your child

799
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:35,134
and you cut the cake first

800
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,026
because you are the housewife.

801
00:57:38,892 --> 00:57:42,490
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

802
00:57:43,366 --> 00:57:46,702
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

803
00:57:46,972 --> 00:57:50,245
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

804
00:57:52,242 --> 00:57:54,261
Look after all of them,

805
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,140
and this is what is a Raga is.

806
00:58:00,202 --> 00:58:04,811
It caters to all your angularities.

807
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:08,036
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

808
00:58:08,124 --> 00:58:10,793
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

809
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,209
It soothes you down.

810
00:58:14,968 --> 00:58:17,182
It makes you settle down.

811
00:58:17,928 --> 00:58:23,124
Like people come home for five days, live like

812
00:58:23,707 --> 00:58:26,047
 I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

813
00:58:26,312 --> 00:58:29,258
and live in a tent-like thing

814
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:32,507
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

815
00:58:33,272 --> 00:58:35,145
or they go and stay in a hotel.

816
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,791
Nobody wants to stay in the house

817
00:58:38,363 --> 00:58:41,588
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

818
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:47,945
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

819
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,257
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

820
00:58:51,372 --> 00:58:55,046
Imagine somebody listening to a Raga when he's a jumpy.

821
00:58:57,336 --> 00:58:59,060
So, one has to settle down

822
00:58:59,465 --> 00:59:04,883
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

823
00:59:05,162 --> 00:59:06,783
who is a housewife,

824
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,651
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

825
00:59:11,249 --> 00:59:15,028
 As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

826
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,110
in the modern times, much more,

827
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:22,098
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

828
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:24,482
Is that the wife...

829
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:28,321
normally in India before, you see,

830
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:30,689
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

831
00:59:30,919 --> 00:59:33,041
all the time his wife is not with him.

832
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:36,178
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

833
00:59:36,478 --> 00:59:40,456
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

834
00:59:41,171 --> 00:59:43,705
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

835
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:45,715
then they have a divorce.

836
00:59:46,465 --> 00:59:49,333
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

837
00:59:49,491 --> 00:59:51,793
household, Sahajayoga, things like that.

838
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,861
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

839
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,850
sits on the ground, in India.

840
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,583
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

841
01:00:01,686 --> 01:00:04,608
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

842
01:00:04,746 --> 01:00:09,073
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

843
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:12,443
Or  "This lady was quarrelling"

844
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:15,231
or "I met another lady she was telling me you were this

845
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:18,535
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

846
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:20,841
That's why in India

847
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:23,048
 if husband has to show temper he doesn't eat

848
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:26,202
 his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

849
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:32,239
That is how, they show their temper.

850
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:35,445
 So then she fans the husband slowly

851
01:00:35,647 --> 01:00:39,299
and tells him good things, "You see, today you know why?

852
01:00:39,548 --> 01:00:43,589
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

853
01:00:44,291 --> 01:00:47,149
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes, he said, he said so".

854
01:00:47,414 --> 01:00:50,692
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

855
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,605
but you see all nice things, you see,

856
01:00:56,774 --> 01:00:59,870
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

857
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,101
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

858
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,833
And your sister is coming.

859
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,937
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

860
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:08,113
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

861
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:12,581
So he eats his food nicely then he go washes his hands

862
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:15,606
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

863
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,927
where there is a jam, always.

864
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:23,726
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

865
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:27,414
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

866
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,917
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

867
01:01:30,116 --> 01:01:32,554
that on the periphery of the

868
01:01:33,843 --> 01:01:35,956
wheel you have the speed

869
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:40,874
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahajayogis have to be at the axis,

870
01:01:41,622 --> 01:01:45,997
and so the husband and the wife,
 the left and the right side of a chariot

871
01:01:46,381 --> 01:01:48,501
have to be on the axis

872
01:01:48,724 --> 01:01:51,559
and the left is left and the right is right.

873
01:01:52,101 --> 01:01:54,754
 Now the women always take more time to get ready.

874
01:01:54,905 --> 01:01:57,240
Not Me, I take less than My husband,

875
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:02,172
much less than My husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

876
01:02:02,715 --> 01:02:06,280
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

877
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:09,728
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

878
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:12,111
Men must see their watches ten times.

879
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:17,116
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

880
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:18,938
if they are real women.

881
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:22,408
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

882
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:26,072
But they are women and you are men,

883
01:02:26,263 --> 01:02:29,177
and God has made men and women.

884
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:31,324
If it was to make a unisex,

885
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:33,967
He would have made unisex, He did not.

886
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,652
 So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

887
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:43,546
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

888
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:46,486
And you must know this is Woman's party!

889
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:49,883
 In India we have these things like, you know,

890
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,142
I was married in a family,

891
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:56,240
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

892
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,170
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of My husband,

893
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:03,324
so, he told My elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

894
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:05,607
my friend come and see Me.

895
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:11,880
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for Me

896
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:15,425
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

897
01:03:15,664 --> 01:03:19,104
and told his wife that "See that She goes and sees the collector".

898
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,401
See how beautiful it was,

899
01:03:25,312 --> 01:03:27,518
how beautiful it was,

900
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,326
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

901
01:03:32,438 --> 01:03:36,090
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

902
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:42,756
 But for this what you need is pure Intelligence.

903
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,878
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

904
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:49,979
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down the husband.

905
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:54,608
If a woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

906
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:59,240
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

907
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:03,642
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

908
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:10,977
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

909
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,751
That person is the most sensitive,

910
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:16,968
is the most intelligent.

911
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:20,374
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

912
01:04:21,203 --> 01:04:23,760
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

913
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:25,509
so, is better leave it to the book,

914
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,781
and today let us have the puja

915
01:04:27,908 --> 01:04:29,479
May God Bless You.

916
01:04:29,586 --> 01:04:31,291
 Any questions?

917
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:39,642
This means, I'll be spending some money!

918
01:04:41,058 --> 01:04:44,100
I don't know, there's no chance! I don't know when will I spend.

919
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,909
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

920
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:48,663
 That's why the money is for.

921
01:04:48,777 --> 01:04:50,515
Must give to others, you see.

922
01:04:50,578 --> 01:04:52,634
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

923
01:04:52,686 --> 01:04:54,578
Just enjoy giving others.

924
01:04:55,677 --> 01:04:58,264
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
