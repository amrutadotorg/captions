00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.080
They have asked Me to speak in Hindi language.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.840
I think you people will excuse Me.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.640
Later on I'll explain to you what I said in short.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.160
Today we are standing at a point,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.720
which we can call as a dividing line

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.320
between materialism and spirituality.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.520
I am going to speak on that subject in Hindi language.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.760
[HINDI ]

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:08.560
I have told them only the pangs of materialism.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.680
How you people are suffering and how everything is sellable.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.920
Everything becomes sellable, chastity is sellable,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.680
goodness is sellable, everything is sellable.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.240
Then what happens, that you just have the money, so called,

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.720
for a very short time,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.520
and actually people are bankrupt.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.920
Healthwise, mentally they are really bankrupt.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.760
So this materialism is to be understood in the Lakshmi principle,

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.280
which is that you should have love.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.880
Lakshmi is the personification of love.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.520
She wears always a pink sari. Pink is the...

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.240
... is the representative of her loving character.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.600
So if you can turn everything to love, materialism will be finished,

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.000
because they are on opposite direction.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.640
And that's what I have tried to explain to them,

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:12.080
by many references here and there, how you can overcome materialism.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:16.000
I wish somebody could translate this and give it to the people,

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.040
so they can understand.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.880
But I think, with vibrations it will work out better.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.280
May God bless you.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.720
