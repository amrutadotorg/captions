00:34.083 --> 00:39.333
Brian, you better be sitted. Let Brian be sitted first.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.333
So you are all right, Warren?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.709
Get up. Let him sit. He cannot see.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.959
Now, it's all right.

00:55.792 --> 00:59.083
I know Chris has already

00:59.291 --> 01:03.667
informed you about

01:03.875 --> 01:06.999
the advent of Sahaja Yoga.

01:08.667 --> 01:12.291
As you know modern times,

01:12.500 --> 01:15.917
are great times,

01:16.083 --> 01:19.458
for spirituality.

01:19.709 --> 01:24.709
Never before, in the history,

01:24.917 --> 01:30.250
of this universe, there were so many seekers.

01:35.125 --> 01:40.083
Even if you go back, about say twenty five years,

01:42.417 --> 01:44.792
people never talked even about seeking.

01:44.999 --> 01:48.291
They didn't know what it was like.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.959
But suddenly,

01:51.125 --> 01:55.834
this feeling of seeking,

01:56.000 --> 02:01.125
has become very strong all over the world.

02:03.166 --> 02:07.500
There must be some special reason for that.

02:09.709 --> 02:13.875
When the seeking is felt,

02:14.041 --> 02:17.875
not necessarily we know what we are seeking.

02:18.041 --> 02:22.333
It's not necessary that we know what we have to seek.

02:22.583 --> 02:27.250
Also it is not necessary to understand how to seek.

02:28.583 --> 02:34.959
But a feeling of urge, a tremendous urge within us,

02:35.125 --> 02:38.000
makes us feel,

02:38.208 --> 02:41.458
that there is something beyond we have to seek also,

02:41.667 --> 02:45.083
that we don't feel satisfied with what we have.

02:45.583 --> 02:50.999
There must be something more that we should know.

02:51.333 --> 02:55.458
Whatever we have known so far as human beings,

02:55.667 --> 02:59.500
we do not feel contented by that.

03:01.667 --> 03:05.291
All the countries who have had affluence,

03:05.500 --> 03:07.291
had this urge much more.

03:07.500 --> 03:13.458
than the countries who are still, aspiring for affluence,

03:14.834 --> 03:19.458
for a plastic development, you can call it.

03:22.333 --> 03:27.083
In the affluent countries only people are realizing more

03:27.291 --> 03:31.834
that the joy is not in the matter.

03:33.041 --> 03:37.999
It is somewhere else. It is not in the possession of matter.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.709
It is somewhere else that we will find the joy,

03:41.917 --> 03:46.291
and so the eyes are turned,

03:46.500 --> 03:49.041
towards the new role

03:49.250 --> 03:52.917
of achieving something that is not yet known to us.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.792
So this urge within us,

04:01.166 --> 04:07.709
this urge within us is something so innate, so built in us.

04:08.041 --> 04:13.834
As animals have urge to eat and satisfy their hunger,

04:16.667 --> 04:20.834
there's a category of human beings

04:21.000 --> 04:26.041
who are feeling this urge, within themselves.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.667
Now what is that urge?

04:30.875 --> 04:34.333
And what do we have to find?

04:37.667 --> 04:42.375
We have to find the meaning of our life.

04:42.999 --> 04:47.625
We have to find out why are we here.

04:48.625 --> 04:54.375
We have to know why from amoeba stage we have become human beings.

04:54.875 --> 05:00.125
What was the need for the nature to take us through these,

05:00.333 --> 05:03.417
these various stages of our evolution,

05:03.625 --> 05:06.250
to make us human beings as we are.

05:06.917 --> 05:10.709
What is the purpose of this life?

05:11.333 --> 05:14.625
Why are we on this earth?

05:14.959 --> 05:19.125
Is there any purpose or not? Or it is all purposeless?

05:19.333 --> 05:21.667
That we should wonder,

05:21.875 --> 05:25.709
from this stage to another stage.

05:25.917 --> 05:30.417
And now is that the last stage,

05:30.625 --> 05:33.041
stage when we are human beings.

05:33.250 --> 05:37.083
Is this the complete maturity that we have achieved

05:37.291 --> 05:38.750
of our evolution?

05:38.959 --> 05:44.375
Is this the end of our evolution or we have to evolve more?

05:46.875 --> 05:51.875
Whether I go to cities or to villages,

05:52.041 --> 05:54.250
whether I go to universities

05:54.458 --> 05:57.959
or to places like Russia,

05:58.125 --> 06:03.375
where people are educated in a different way,

06:03.583 --> 06:05.667
I find everyone has this.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.792
You'll be amazed, even if you are democratic

06:07.999 --> 06:11.709
or you are communistic or anything you are,

06:11.917 --> 06:17.875
they all are feeling that whatever they have, is not their goal.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.834
There's something more that is needed.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.999
That's how the seeking is on and on and on.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.750
I'm so very happy to see

06:26.959 --> 06:30.125
that there are so many seekers in Cheltenham,

06:30.333 --> 06:32.750
that they have come here

06:32.959 --> 06:37.083
to know about seeking, to find out what we have to seek.

06:37.625 --> 06:43.792
As I told you the seeking is innate, that is built in within us.

06:44.917 --> 06:47.375
It has something to do with our evolutionary process

06:47.583 --> 06:48.999
which is a living process.

06:49.166 --> 06:55.458
Perhaps you never realized what Christ talked about the living God.

06:55.792 --> 07:01.750
We do not understand what it means by a living God.

07:02.542 --> 07:06.709
That's why we get confused.

07:07.917 --> 07:11.208
We cannot pay for living things.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.834
We cannot.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.917
For example a seed has to sprout, it will sprout.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.500
If you put it into Mother Earth,

07:19.709 --> 07:22.625
it will sprout by itself spontaneously, you can't pay for it.

07:22.834 --> 07:23.875
You cannot pay to the seed,

07:24.041 --> 07:28.041
"All right, I pay you one pound. Will you please sprout?"

07:28.583 --> 07:32.291
You see a flower suddenly becomes a fruit or a tree.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.291
We are not paying anything to the flower.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.125
It has become spontaneously.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.834
Thousands of such flowers are becoming fruit. We can't do that.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.291
If we want, we can't do it.

07:45.917 --> 07:48.917
It just works out. We see all these miracles every day,

07:49.083 --> 07:52.458
but we do not think how it has happened.

07:52.667 --> 07:56.999
What is that power which has done this job?

07:58.208 --> 08:01.875
Then the discrimination, supposing,

08:02.041 --> 08:04.667
if you sow a seed,

08:04.875 --> 08:08.083
which have peaches [in the tree],

08:09.583 --> 08:12.834
you won't get mangoes out of peach tree. You can't.

08:13.083 --> 08:19.999
And imagine the amount of beautiful arrangement and analytical

08:21.333 --> 08:23.834
planning.

08:24.458 --> 08:29.375
How it works out? Your child looks like you.

08:30.542 --> 08:35.125
In the human body it is said that,

08:35.333 --> 08:40.000
anything foreign, goes in this human body is thrown out.

08:41.625 --> 08:46.625
But doctors cannot explain when the fetus takes its moves

08:46.834 --> 08:49.999
in the body, why they can't throw away? It should be thrown away,

08:50.208 --> 08:53.500
under all principles of natural laws.

08:53.709 --> 08:58.709
But there's something that looks after it, nourishes it,

08:58.917 --> 09:05.208
allows it to grow and when it has come to that stage, it comes out.

09:06.333 --> 09:08.458
There are thousand and one things I can tell you

09:08.667 --> 09:12.999
that nature is doing for us which we take for granted.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.917
All this is done

09:16.083 --> 09:20.625
by the All Pervading Divine Power.

09:20.834 --> 09:24.625
I call it, this is the Love of God.

09:25.208 --> 09:31.041
It's the power of Holy Ghost, who does all these things.

09:31.875 --> 09:36.417
But why should you believe? In these days nobody believes anymore.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.999
That's a good idea. But they do.

09:40.333 --> 09:44.250
If you are mesmerized you will.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.625
That's how many gurus have mesmerized, taken money,

09:47.834 --> 09:52.083
made big, big empires for themselves.

09:52.750 --> 09:56.208
Because in freedom to understand,

09:56.417 --> 09:58.917
you need innocence,

09:59.083 --> 10:02.959
you need sensitivity,

10:03.166 --> 10:08.291
which I am afraid is attacked every moment

10:08.500 --> 10:10.875
in the modern life.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.625
The matter it is sitting on our head.

10:13.834 --> 10:17.208
It doesn't allow our spontaneity.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.834
The matter is all the time enveloping us,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.750
and the Spirit is lost.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.875
So, when you say about Spirit,

10:32.333 --> 10:36.917
we must know that we have to seek our Spirit,

10:37.500 --> 10:42.417
the Spirit which is within us, which is in our heart,

10:42.750 --> 10:48.834
which we have to seek, means this conscious mind,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.291
should feel the presence of Spirit within us.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.417
We know, and we have read should there must be Spirit somewhere.

10:55.917 --> 10:59.917
We also heard that the Spirit is the one we have to get,

11:00.083 --> 11:03.583
that we have to be born again. All right. So?

11:03.792 --> 11:06.208
We accept it.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.166
But how this is going to happen?

11:11.166 --> 11:13.291
Because it's a living process,

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
because it's an evolutionary process

11:15.709 --> 11:19.458
it will happen spontaneously by itself.

11:20.041 --> 11:24.125
As you have become a human being from the monkey stage,

11:24.333 --> 11:26.458
what have you done about it? Nothing.

11:26.667 --> 11:29.333
Effortlessly you have become a human being.

11:29.542 --> 11:34.458
In the same way, if it has to happen, it has to happen effortlessly.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.709
If you have to go higher,

11:40.917 --> 11:44.625
than this stage of your existence as a human being,

11:44.834 --> 11:48.291
it has to happen effortlessly,

11:48.500 --> 11:51.999
without organizing, without planning it.

11:52.709 --> 11:56.583
The plan, is the plan of the nature,

11:56.792 --> 11:59.166
the divine plan that has to grow.

11:59.375 --> 12:03.333
Is the Divine that has to give you the grace doing it.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.500
But in the modern times we don't believe in the Divine.

12:08.709 --> 12:11.667
We don't want to talk of God.

12:12.208 --> 12:17.834
We don't want to say that there is God, naturally.

12:18.083 --> 12:22.500
Because those who talked of God, mislaid us.

12:23.750 --> 12:27.834
They made all kinds of mistakes, I agree that.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.667
They didn't know what was to be done

12:31.875 --> 12:35.166
or maybe they were ignorant about it.

12:35.375 --> 12:39.917
All the religions, every religion.

12:40.417 --> 12:45.000
Not a fad or a cult but a religion,

12:45.208 --> 12:50.458
has said that you are to be born again.

12:53.125 --> 12:56.834
You are to be resurrected.

12:59.875 --> 13:03.542
This is being said and promised.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.542
It has to happen.

13:07.750 --> 13:13.333
But how? Again, the mind is such that it asks, "How?".

13:13.542 --> 13:19.083
I again say, "Spontaneously, by itself".

13:20.417 --> 13:24.458
That it has to happen, that you have to become the Spirit.

13:24.709 --> 13:28.875
But we get lost when people talk.

13:31.291 --> 13:35.999
Some have got, sometimes....

13:36.166 --> 13:38.875
say Australia I've met some people,

13:39.041 --> 13:44.000
they said, "We are born again". Self-certified born again.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.999
I said, "Really? That's nice. My job is over.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.917
I'm very happy that you are twice born."

13:51.083 --> 13:53.417
I said, "But how do you say you are born again?"

13:53.625 --> 13:56.834
What is the certificate? Movie imagined?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.500
I said, "Somehow, supposing tomorrow I say,

13:59.709 --> 14:03.250
"I'm the queen of England and go round",

14:03.458 --> 14:05.083
nobody is going to believe Me.

14:05.291 --> 14:08.041
Perhaps they might arrest Me.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.291
I said they are all self-certificate ideas [unclear]

14:11.500 --> 14:13.792
"If I have that, I'm born again".

14:13.999 --> 14:16.375
No wisdom.

14:16.834 --> 14:22.750
"According to Bible we are born again". What is according to Bible?

14:24.375 --> 14:26.792
They are many who have controverted Me, Jews,

14:26.999 --> 14:29.500
Christians, Hindus, Muslims.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.917
I asked them, "What is according to Bible

14:32.083 --> 14:35.917
should happen to you when you are born again?

14:36.250 --> 14:40.000
What Christ has said, in very, very simple words?

14:40.375 --> 14:44.083
Your hands will speak."

14:45.542 --> 14:49.000
Your hands will speak.

14:49.750 --> 14:55.709
That means there will be a new kind of a sensitivity on your hands.

14:56.125 --> 15:00.542
That means your central nervous system will achieve

15:00.750 --> 15:04.750
a new dimension, a new awareness.

15:05.333 --> 15:10.834
In modern times, we have psychologists like Jung who have said,

15:11.000 --> 15:14.250
that if you have to become something higher,

15:14.458 --> 15:18.625
you will be, be again, not imagination,

15:18.834 --> 15:22.291
not self-certificate, but actualization,

15:22.500 --> 15:28.458
actually you will be collectively conscious.

15:31.959 --> 15:34.041
This is the criteria.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.917
That you have to become. It is to be actualized.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.959
It is not just somebody say, "Oh, you are collectively [unclear]".

15:39.125 --> 15:44.041
How? Because you are now jumping together?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.542
Now, as I've told you the [thing is very different] that,

15:49.750 --> 15:54.291
living processes we cannot do. We can do only dead things.

15:54.625 --> 15:58.375
Like a tree is, then we make a table out of it,

15:58.583 --> 16:01.208
make a chair, sit on the chair. The chair sits on our head.

16:01.417 --> 16:04.125
We can't sit without the chair.

16:04.667 --> 16:09.458
These are dead things. Can we transform one

16:09.875 --> 16:11.625
flower into fruit?

16:12.667 --> 16:15.417
So something then should happen to you which you cannot do.

16:15.625 --> 16:19.458
Jumping together, what's so great?

16:23.542 --> 16:26.417
All such things that we do, can, we can do

16:26.625 --> 16:30.625
without becoming twice born.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.166
All such ideas that people have,

16:33.375 --> 16:36.875
that if you start behaving like a wild animal,

16:37.041 --> 16:39.000
you are a realized soul,

16:39.208 --> 16:41.166
I must say they are sadly mistaken.

16:41.375 --> 16:46.709
Or that you start flying in the air, this is also, it's stupid.

16:47.166 --> 16:52.792
Because now we are not going to become birds or frogs.

16:52.999 --> 16:55.792
We are going to become something great,

16:55.999 --> 16:58.208
within ourselves, in our awareness,

16:58.417 --> 17:00.999
we are going to achieve something more.

17:01.542 --> 17:05.333
So those who want to teach you how to fly,

17:05.542 --> 17:08.709
you should, need not give them three thousand pounds each.

17:08.917 --> 17:12.999
You better tell them to fly first of all. See how they fly.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.999
Drop them from this tower of Pisa.

17:18.875 --> 17:20.792
I think it was built for such people only.

17:20.999 --> 17:24.542
I used to wonder why this was so specially raised.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.792
It's better to try these people from there

17:26.999 --> 17:31.500
and see if they can fly even an inch.

17:32.999 --> 17:36.208
All such false stories we believe

17:36.417 --> 17:39.959
because they have a circus with them.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.834
Because they are not simple, they are complicated

17:43.000 --> 17:46.875
and to our complicated mind they sound very well.

17:47.250 --> 17:51.333
God knows what they talk, talk of something,

17:51.542 --> 17:55.291
and we say, "Oh, he must be a perfect master, the way he talks".

17:55.583 --> 17:59.291
God knows what he is and what he does.

17:59.500 --> 18:04.250
But we have to ask questions what have we got ourselves.

18:05.625 --> 18:09.417
It is promised that you will be the Spirit,

18:09.625 --> 18:12.375
that you will becoming the Spirit.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.375
That means your conscious mind will know the Spirit,

18:15.583 --> 18:18.041
that the light of Spirit will come into you,

18:18.250 --> 18:21.875
will give you the power of the Spirit.

18:23.583 --> 18:27.083
We have to see, did we get that power?

18:27.375 --> 18:31.125
We have to find out.

18:31.583 --> 18:35.000
And spirit means dead bodies, dead souls.

18:35.208 --> 18:38.625
They put you into some sort of a mesmerism,

18:38.999 --> 18:43.125
and you have to believe, "Oh, we are very spiritual people".

18:43.333 --> 18:48.458
Like so many cults I've seen, they end up in suicides,

18:48.709 --> 18:54.333
and they end up in all kinds of fancy things, wine, madness.

18:54.999 --> 18:58.625
You become a very noble,

18:58.834 --> 19:02.125
very dignified,

19:02.333 --> 19:05.000
very knowledgeable people.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.792
And the knowledge about which people have said,

19:07.999 --> 19:12.250
that you will have the knowledge, is not the bookish knowledge.

19:12.583 --> 19:15.291
It's not what you read in the books,

19:15.500 --> 19:18.458
or even from, from the Bible what you read,

19:18.667 --> 19:21.917
it's not what is written there.

19:25.333 --> 19:30.000
You have to have those deep insides to read

19:30.208 --> 19:33.125
what's written in these books.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.500
Christ never went into any school,

19:36.709 --> 19:40.166
into any college or university.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.999
And He was so knowledgeable.

19:46.792 --> 19:50.667
There are many like this in India, we can say people

19:50.875 --> 19:56.792
who are realized souls, perhaps never went for any,

19:56.999 --> 19:59.250
because they are knowledge.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.875
So what does knowledge mean then?

20:03.667 --> 20:09.333
Means that your awareness should grow.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.625
One should understand what is the difference

20:12.834 --> 20:18.917
between a book knowledge and the awareness should know.

20:19.625 --> 20:23.875
For example, animals have no awareness for cleanliness,

20:24.041 --> 20:26.041
neatness, they have no awareness of that.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.875
You can take a horse to any place,

20:29.041 --> 20:32.125
you don't need anything to cover his nose.

20:32.375 --> 20:36.125
At the most you can cover his eyes because he may go here and there.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.500
But for a human being to pass through such dirty places,

20:39.709 --> 20:43.959
may be impossible. He may have to cover his nose.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.917
So the awareness of human beings, as far as cleanliness is concerned

20:48.083 --> 20:51.875
beauty is concerned is much greater.

20:52.542 --> 20:57.750
But when he becomes a realized soul what happens to his awareness?

20:58.542 --> 21:03.417
First and foremost he becomes collectively conscious.

21:04.125 --> 21:08.667
that he knows what's wrong with other people.

21:08.917 --> 21:13.166
His hands speak. These five fingers, six and seven,

21:13.709 --> 21:19.917
represent the five sympathetic

21:20.083 --> 21:23.625
subtle centers within us and these five

21:23.917 --> 21:26.083
seven of these and seven of these.

21:26.291 --> 21:29.750
And these seven, five, six and seven,

21:29.959 --> 21:33.625
and seven on this side combine together to form these centers

21:33.834 --> 21:36.291
which are subtle centers, one on the left hand side,

21:36.500 --> 21:38.333
one on the right hand side.

21:38.542 --> 21:41.792
Only on your fingers, you can feel a person and can say, "All right,

21:41.999 --> 21:44.959
this gentleman is having a problem here."

21:45.125 --> 21:47.625
That means it's something from this center,

21:47.834 --> 21:49.500
maybe he has got bronchitis,

21:49.709 --> 21:52.333
or he has cold [trouble] or something like that,

21:54.875 --> 21:57.375
he's got some sort of a fever,

21:57.583 --> 22:02.709
or if you know it very well, if the sensitivity feels...

22:25.125 --> 22:27.542
So the awareness that we have,

22:27.750 --> 22:33.000
becomes the dynamic awareness by which we start feeling others.

22:33.709 --> 22:37.583
We start understanding the problems of others,

22:37.792 --> 22:41.041
physical, mental and emotional, on our fingers.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.583
Even this child, Lucia, is a born realized.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.959
There are many born realized children now in England.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.625
Just on their fingers they can say, what finger is catching,

22:49.834 --> 22:53.125
what finger is burning, what finger is numb.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.917
Then the knowledge about yourself is also there.

22:58.083 --> 23:02.083
You can also find out about yourself what center you are catching.

23:03.083 --> 23:06.417
Now supposing a person is very egoistical,

23:06.625 --> 23:09.667
If you tell him that, "You are egoistical",

23:09.917 --> 23:11.999
you'll never see him again.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.208
God knows what will happen.

23:14.417 --> 23:16.917
But, after Realization, he himself will come and say,

23:17.083 --> 23:19.792
"Mother, my Agnya, is catching. Better take over, put it all right."

23:19.999 --> 23:23.291
Because he starts seeing this in

23:23.500 --> 23:26.417
and he doesn't like.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.333
Like say, My sari, gets a

23:29.542 --> 23:31.959
some sort of a spot and I can't see it. So, it's all right,

23:32.125 --> 23:35.417
if you say, "Your sari is dirty", I may not like it.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.792
But if I see it, if there is light and see it myself,

23:38.999 --> 23:41.834
I'm not identified with that thought,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.875
or with that dirt, I want to clean it.

23:45.583 --> 23:50.083
Because you know about yourself, you are separated from yourself,

23:50.291 --> 23:53.166
you start seeing all these on yourself,

23:53.375 --> 23:56.333
you want to clean it because you don't like it,

23:56.542 --> 24:00.458
because they obstruct you. That is what happens to you.

24:01.999 --> 24:04.834
When you have,

24:05.041 --> 24:09.999
this dynamic power in your attention,

24:10.166 --> 24:14.083
which tells you what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

24:15.125 --> 24:17.458
you start feeling the cool breeze for the first time,

24:17.667 --> 24:21.166
of the Holy Ghost, the All pervading Power.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.999
In the Bible,

24:24.166 --> 24:27.834
once Christ was walking and some lady held His

24:31.458 --> 24:35.792
cloth, and He said, "Who has touched Me?"

24:37.125 --> 24:40.667
His energy passed through Him.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.333
That time we didn't have realized people,

24:46.542 --> 24:50.417
so He was crucified. They were blind.

24:50.625 --> 24:53.709
They didn't know what He was. How will they know?

24:54.083 --> 25:00.083
He talked all right, but so what?

25:01.166 --> 25:04.667
He talked of few things, so what?

25:04.959 --> 25:09.291
There were a lot people with eyes,

25:09.500 --> 25:11.999
they didn't like Him.

25:12.166 --> 25:14.583
They crucified Him.

25:14.792 --> 25:19.333
They didn't want to accept at that time that their Mesia has come,

25:19.542 --> 25:22.999
that their Savior has come.

25:23.166 --> 25:26.417
They couldn't believe that in their lifetime somebody has come now,

25:26.625 --> 25:29.542
and they stand in face to face with reality.

25:29.750 --> 25:33.875
They wouldn't accept it. I wish they had.

25:34.125 --> 25:39.583
On the contrary, within three years time Christ was crucified.

25:39.999 --> 25:43.999
Because He talked about you,

25:46.667 --> 25:48.875
because He told them about the reality.

25:49.041 --> 25:52.458
They couldn't appreciate

25:52.667 --> 25:57.333
that He was pointing out to something which they did.

25:57.959 --> 26:00.583
They wanted to have a Mesia after two thousand years,

26:00.792 --> 26:03.750
even after that, that time must be three thousand years.

26:04.041 --> 26:09.166
And they wouldn't believe that Christ suffered,

26:09.375 --> 26:12.333
suffered for their sins.

26:13.375 --> 26:19.750
They want to have sufferings, so they had this massacre.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.792
He has suffered for us.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.041
That means such a lot.

26:27.250 --> 26:31.999
It means that people wouldn't have to suffer anymore.

26:32.333 --> 26:35.667
It means that all your karma,

26:35.875 --> 26:40.166
have no meaning in the presence of Divine now.

26:40.625 --> 26:44.542
It means if Christ is awakened within you,

26:45.125 --> 26:50.500
He sucks in all your karma’s, your conditioning’s,

26:50.709 --> 26:55.250
and also the so-called selfishness.

26:55.542 --> 27:01.959
He is placed here, in the center of Agnya chakra.

27:02.458 --> 27:04.999
One after another we have been making mistakes,

27:05.166 --> 27:08.999
so many mistakes, it takes only the life of Christ.

27:09.458 --> 27:13.792
Then about Mohamed, about everybody else,

27:13.999 --> 27:18.166
that they went to India and never told that Christ is born,

27:18.375 --> 27:20.917
that He has lived and has died on the cross,

27:21.083 --> 27:24.999
the way should have been told because already described.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
They have already described about Him,

27:29.166 --> 27:31.875
and such and such great soul will be born,

27:32.041 --> 27:36.000
whom He will be, from what level of awareness he'll be coming,

27:36.208 --> 27:39.041
what He will be doing,

27:39.250 --> 27:44.500
what will be His work, in the Indian Scriptures.

27:45.500 --> 27:49.667
Only the name was Mahavishnu.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.291
If you read about Him, you'll be amazed,

27:53.500 --> 27:57.125
to such detail they have described Him.

27:57.375 --> 28:02.083
Even about Mohamed they described in ancient Scriptures.

28:02.999 --> 28:05.333
But the way they went to India,

28:05.542 --> 28:08.709
those who are talking of Christ, imagine they are Christians,

28:08.917 --> 28:11.792
most violent people, I should say.

28:12.458 --> 28:16.166
With a pistol in the hand and Bible in the other.

28:16.375 --> 28:19.917
I've seen people who talk of Christ are extremely violent,

28:20.083 --> 28:22.291
disturbing,

28:22.500 --> 28:27.875
and sometimes, shamelessly anti-Christ.

28:31.583 --> 28:35.000
And the way they behave,

28:35.208 --> 28:36.999
and nobody could believe

28:37.166 --> 28:40.625
that such a great personality is already born.

28:40.834 --> 28:42.959
They carried on with these karma theories,

28:43.125 --> 28:45.709
and that's, what to do, [there are karmic laws].

28:45.917 --> 28:48.041
If you tell them, "I've paid you three thousand pounds,

28:48.250 --> 28:49.625
now what about my ascent?"

28:49.834 --> 28:52.041
They'll say, "Oh, but your karma’s are still there".

28:52.250 --> 28:56.250
One even told that "I just can manage one sixteenth of it,

28:56.458 --> 28:58.166
the rest you have to manage".

28:58.375 --> 28:59.917
So you paid only for the one sixteenth,

29:00.083 --> 29:02.709
you have to pay for the rest perhaps.

29:03.041 --> 29:08.875
All these nonsensical things in the name of God,

29:09.709 --> 29:13.709
has been going on for ages now.

29:14.917 --> 29:16.625
My forefathers did it,

29:16.834 --> 29:19.625
your forefathers did it and all of them have been doing it.

29:19.834 --> 29:25.083
Poor things, they didn't know what they have done, how they have

29:25.291 --> 29:30.792
been put into such horrible lace

29:30.999 --> 29:33.417
of misguidance.

29:33.750 --> 29:37.542
But now, let us understand that the guide has come,

29:37.750 --> 29:41.166
for all of us, to be the Spirit.

29:41.375 --> 29:44.333
You are seekers of ages.

29:45.709 --> 29:48.291
That's how you are here.

29:48.959 --> 29:52.333
And you have to find your Spirit.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.041
You have to have little patience with yourself.

29:55.250 --> 29:59.417
But it's one thing I ask you, as I have patience for you,

29:59.625 --> 30:03.875
you have to have patience for yourself.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.583
That's all. Nothing else is needed.

30:08.083 --> 30:13.000
It will just work out without any difficulty, I'm quite sure of it.

30:14.500 --> 30:21.000
You had such a great poet like William Blake, who has said,

30:21.208 --> 30:25.291
that men of God will become prophets,

30:25.500 --> 30:30.542
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

30:34.083 --> 30:38.125
Whatever mistakes you have committed have to be forgiven.

30:38.417 --> 30:42.458
Because if this world is to be saved, His creation,

30:42.667 --> 30:45.792
that's the epitome of creation, the human beings

30:45.999 --> 30:50.500
if they are to be saved,

30:50.750 --> 30:54.250
the Divine Itself, that God Almighty,

30:54.458 --> 30:59.500
has to use all His might, to save you.

31:00.208 --> 31:05.083
Because He has created you. He's going to do it.

31:05.291 --> 31:10.750
But we have to be little humble about it and it works out.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.959
It has worked wonders.

31:14.125 --> 31:20.583
Many people ask Me that in India, I'm more effective.

31:20.792 --> 31:23.999
No doubt, because Indians are simple people,

31:24.166 --> 31:26.125
in the villages, in the smaller places,

31:26.333 --> 31:31.542
not the cities and more sort of complicated, you see. And

31:32.125 --> 31:34.999
they are very easy to get Realization and to settle down.

31:35.166 --> 31:39.542
For them this knowledge is already there. They know what to expect.

31:39.750 --> 31:42.417
They know what happens, you see. It's described,

31:42.625 --> 31:45.375
that you will get the cool breeze. In the Bible also it is there,

31:45.583 --> 31:47.291
but we just get a glimpse here and there,

31:47.500 --> 31:50.875
because people didn't allow Him to even talk.

31:51.375 --> 31:55.375
They didn't give Him any chance. They just killed Him.

31:55.999 --> 32:00.625
But India has the heritage in this, and they have

32:00.834 --> 32:05.959
full ideas to what it is and how to recognize a saint. They know.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.999
Everybody knows who is a saint, in India.

32:09.166 --> 32:11.709
They are not easily taken up by people

32:11.917 --> 32:15.500
who are doing all kinds of tricks.

32:16.166 --> 32:20.999
Only the modern people you see, they, who are,

32:21.166 --> 32:25.542
who have had no idea of the ancient,

32:25.750 --> 32:29.709
Scriptures and warnings can be befooled

32:29.917 --> 32:32.458
but not those who know about it.

32:32.667 --> 32:38.208
Or only the naive, who have had no education

32:38.417 --> 32:42.250
about their heritage can be mislead.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.999
Then people say, "Mother why are You

32:45.166 --> 32:48.542
so much anxious to be in England?"

32:49.041 --> 32:51.834
So I came to England just by chance, spontaneously.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.583
As you know My husband got elected with this job.

32:55.792 --> 32:59.750
And this agency of the U.N.

33:00.792 --> 33:04.834
is London based. This is the only agency you have.

33:05.083 --> 33:08.959
All agencies are in Geneva, or in Rome or in New York.

33:09.291 --> 33:12.542
But this is the only maritime agency you have,

33:12.750 --> 33:16.625
for which he got elected by so many countries.

33:16.834 --> 33:21.625
And just I am here. Maybe it is all being planned.

33:22.500 --> 33:29.375
As William Blake has said, "England has to become Jerusalem".

33:30.041 --> 33:35.250
It has to become. English people have a special responsibility.

33:35.999 --> 33:40.625
And need not be influenced by French or Americans.

33:41.083 --> 33:44.375
They are quite sensible, balanced people.

33:44.959 --> 33:48.999
If they can stand on their own personality they can see clearly,

33:49.166 --> 33:53.542
that everything circulates through them.

33:55.041 --> 33:58.208
England is the hearth of the Universe.

33:58.500 --> 34:03.375
Whatever happens in England circulates all over.

34:03.917 --> 34:09.250
Your prince got married. So many princes get married,

34:09.458 --> 34:12.792
all over the world.

34:15.667 --> 34:18.583
That's a special place you are born.

34:18.792 --> 34:22.917
And you are the sense of this dynamic heart.

34:24.291 --> 34:31.125
Perhaps it is yet not awakened to its own nature,

34:31.999 --> 34:36.792
into that subtle situation where you can realize

34:36.999 --> 34:40.208
how it is related to the whole universe.

34:40.667 --> 34:46.041
But whatever it is once you get your Realization you will realize

34:46.250 --> 34:49.709
what is the situation is like.

34:50.999 --> 34:53.625
Subject matter is too big.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.999
And in London itself, I don't know how many,

34:57.166 --> 35:00.458
five hundred, six hundred lectures I've already given.

35:01.917 --> 35:04.583
And you can also hear My tapes,

35:04.792 --> 35:08.959
sometimes later. They can't come and all accept it.

35:09.125 --> 35:14.750
Today, though it's much easier,

35:14.959 --> 35:18.041
to get your Realization,

35:20.458 --> 35:23.458
when you come in this room, there's darkness,

35:23.667 --> 35:26.083
you can't see anything.

35:26.542 --> 35:30.709
It's much easy to press the button to get the light,

35:30.999 --> 35:34.834
than to explain all the history about electricity,

35:35.000 --> 35:39.208
and specially of Cheltenham, when the electricity came here

35:39.417 --> 35:40.834
and how it was done.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.166
It's better to ask you just to come to this place an get the light.

35:45.500 --> 35:49.083
After getting the light we can talk of it.

35:49.667 --> 35:52.999
That's much better to understand.

35:54.250 --> 35:57.834
I'm very happy at this opportunity,

35:58.417 --> 36:03.917
they could get because of the seminar here, and I could meet you.

36:06.375 --> 36:10.208
I would request you if you have any questions. please ask Me.

36:10.917 --> 36:14.583
Then we'll have the session of Self Realization

36:14.792 --> 36:17.375
and please don't be violent with Me.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.917
I'm very clever and I know how to [calm it down].

36:22.208 --> 36:26.792
If you have to be argumentative,

36:27.250 --> 36:28.999
I can do it in England,

36:29.166 --> 36:32.875
in London, if you come down for a cup of tea.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.667
We have a nice Georgian house, you'll enjoy that.

36:41.875 --> 36:46.166
But here let us speak

36:46.375 --> 36:50.083
careful because we should not

36:50.291 --> 36:53.999
indulge into the activities

36:54.166 --> 36:57.000
as they say "dog in the manger".

36:57.208 --> 37:01.667
There are so many who are anxiously waiting for this happening.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.959
Let them have it.

37:04.125 --> 37:06.208
If you have any questions you can ask Me

37:06.417 --> 37:08.709
but don't try to fight with Me.

37:08.917 --> 37:11.041
I've not come here to fight with you.

37:11.291 --> 37:16.208
I've just come here to relate you to your Spirit.

37:17.999 --> 37:20.458
Once you get it, you can give it to others also.

37:20.667 --> 37:24.792
It's just like one enlightened light can enlighten other

37:24.999 --> 37:29.291
and the other enlightened light can enlighten another.

37:29.625 --> 37:32.709
Simple as that, absolutely simple.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.750
So please ask Me questions if you have any

37:35.959 --> 37:41.166
and I think it will work out this Realization.

38:37.166 --> 38:39.250
SM: -Yes.
P: We had talked,

38:39.458 --> 38:43.000
if you could tell us where your teachings come from,

38:43.208 --> 38:45.667
[if you can share that].

38:45.875 --> 38:49.999
SM: - What is it?
P: - Where exactly your teaching come from?

38:50.500 --> 38:53.000
P: -Who has taught you?
SY: Where do Your teachings come from?

38:53.208 --> 38:54.667
P: - Where do your teachings come from?

38:54.875 --> 38:58.000
SM: - They didn't find out yet. Find out later, all right?

38:58.208 --> 39:01.250
When you will get the light

39:01.458 --> 39:03.625
you'll be quite [unclear] to it. All right?

39:03.834 --> 39:07.333
P: I also want to ask that something,

39:07.542 --> 39:09.709
when the light is switched on

39:09.917 --> 39:14.333
sometimes is too tough for the everyday person

39:14.542 --> 39:19.542
to actually accept [unclear] and...

39:19.750 --> 39:22.917
You see it's not a question if you are accepting or not accepting.

39:23.083 --> 39:26.166
That's one thing one should know. Because you see one thing is

39:26.375 --> 39:28.333
that you see our attitude in seeking also,

39:28.542 --> 39:30.500
has become like a shopping deal attitude.

39:30.709 --> 39:34.125
You can say you will be, " If we want we buy our seeking, buy it".

39:34.333 --> 39:36.750
That's not the point, you see here nobody is selling anything,

39:36.959 --> 39:38.041
[all right]?

39:38.250 --> 39:43.375
Secondly it is a thing that you have.

39:43.625 --> 39:45.709
It's not for me to achieve it.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.875
For example we went to this place where we had the seminar.

39:49.041 --> 39:52.792
It's a beautiful place, spread out [further].

39:52.999 --> 39:54.625
Now if you want to enjoy it, enjoy it,

39:54.834 --> 39:57.208
if you want to close your eyes you can close.

39:57.417 --> 40:02.542
It's like that. All right? No question of accepting. It is there.

40:02.792 --> 40:05.208
If you want to have it have it, or if you don’t want to have it

40:05.417 --> 40:07.125
don’t have it.

40:07.333 --> 40:09.250
You cannot force it on anybody.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.417
Like a question of your mental acceptance

40:11.625 --> 40:16.417
[unclear] because this is beyond your thinking.

40:16.834 --> 40:20.834
You mind is limited. It is unlimited happening.

40:21.458 --> 40:23.166
Now say the river is flowing,

40:23.375 --> 40:25.834
like river Ganges we can say, is flowing.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.750
If you want to fill your pitcher well and good,

40:27.959 --> 40:29.583
she is not going to force on you.

40:29.792 --> 40:31.792
You may say that I don't accept you as guru.

40:31.999 --> 40:33.792
That's not the point here at all.

40:33.999 --> 40:37.250
You see, that you can say to the gurus who take money from you.

40:37.458 --> 40:40.125
You have paid for it, all right. So you can judge him.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.709
Here it is question, if you want to have your Realization

40:42.917 --> 40:44.166
I'm here for you.

40:44.375 --> 40:47.166
If you don't want it , all right

40:47.375 --> 40:49.917
I don't want anything from you. You can't give Me anything.

40:50.083 --> 40:53.291
That's one point. You just can't give Me anything.

40:53.500 --> 40:56.959
I'm on the giving here.

40:57.750 --> 41:01.917
Whether you accept it or not, it's yours, that's not My [own].

41:02.125 --> 41:06.041
I am on the giving point.

41:07.417 --> 41:10.917
It's very common in the west,

41:11.083 --> 41:13.917
because they think I'm selling something, you know.

41:14.083 --> 41:14.875
If I am selling something,

41:15.041 --> 41:16.917
you can say I don't want to accept or I accept.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.792
It's not that. It's [within] you, which is there.

41:19.999 --> 41:23.291
Whether you accept it or not, is not the point.

41:23.500 --> 41:27.208
I didn't say, I didn't give you any opinion of Mine about it.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.625
It's not an opinion whether you feel accepted.

41:29.834 --> 41:32.834
I just give you a statement of practice is this, this is this.

41:33.083 --> 41:35.500
And this is what you have within yourself, all right?

41:35.709 --> 41:39.709
Now if you want to have your Realization, I'm here.

41:40.041 --> 41:43.500
If you don't want to have it, all right.

41:44.208 --> 41:47.500
I cannot force and I do not promise also it will work out.

41:47.709 --> 41:51.208
May, may not. That's it.

41:54.208 --> 41:56.792
What is going to accept or not?

41:56.999 --> 42:00.500
You do not know anything about the Spirit.

42:01.166 --> 42:05.166
Through your mental activity how are you going to judge?

42:06.125 --> 42:08.375
But you have judged that way, I've seen it.

42:08.583 --> 42:10.542
Where it has to be judged still people don't,

42:10.750 --> 42:14.792
otherwise they would not have fallen a pray to these horrible gurus.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.792
They just go ahead a lot into these things.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.583
All kinds of nonsense they do

42:24.792 --> 42:27.542
in the name of God, in the name of seeking, in the name of

42:27.750 --> 42:31.500
finding something, without thinking about.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.458
I don't want anything from you.

42:39.667 --> 42:43.999
Actually I don't need anything, nor do I want anything.

42:44.375 --> 42:46.458
I have thought to give you something.

42:46.667 --> 42:49.041
P: -Will I be able to [cure people]?
SM: -I beg your pardon.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.667
Will I be able to cure people?

42:51.875 --> 42:54.250
SM: -I?
P: - No, would I be able to cure people?

42:54.458 --> 42:56.125
SM: Why not?

42:57.333 --> 43:00.083
She now understands.

43:02.750 --> 43:06.667
You know what you are. You are a human being.

43:07.208 --> 43:10.667
For ages I've taken to make you a human being.

43:12.917 --> 43:15.750
And there should be no diffidence.

43:16.291 --> 43:20.333
This is the most beautiful thing that you have.

43:21.375 --> 43:24.208
This cures cancer.

43:25.125 --> 43:28.999
This cures all kind of mental troubles, emotional troubles,

43:29.166 --> 43:33.542
physical troubles, because the source of all the vitality

43:33.750 --> 43:35.875
starts flowing through you.

43:36.417 --> 43:38.750
Supposing you are driving the car,

43:38.959 --> 43:43.792
your car is getting exhausted or the petrol is getting exhausted

43:43.999 --> 43:46.750
so you are worried? You are in tension.

43:46.999 --> 43:49.999
But if there is some way by which

43:50.166 --> 43:53.208
an opening takes place and there’s a flow

43:53.417 --> 43:57.917
of petrol all the time [being there].

44:00.583 --> 44:03.250
It's fulfilling.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.583
It compliments you.

44:06.999 --> 44:11.709
It gives you a meaning. You'll become beautiful within.

44:15.792 --> 44:19.458
Don't have any diffidence about it,

44:21.041 --> 44:24.166
nor too much confidence that you get it.

44:24.375 --> 44:27.291
I hope all of you will get it.

44:27.625 --> 44:31.875
I can only work it out, but I can't promise.

44:34.250 --> 44:36.750
All right?

44:38.999 --> 44:41.999
Take another question.

45:03.667 --> 45:08.792
Whose that one? Any question?

45:15.999 --> 45:18.917
P: How do you know whether and what you have

45:19.083 --> 45:21.792
self hypnotized yourself?

45:21.999 --> 45:25.500
SM: -Me? P: -Yes. [I don't mean, You in person],

45:25.792 --> 45:28.250
SM: No, very simple. You know it's very easy to understand,

45:28.458 --> 45:29.999
you see, it's very simple to understand.

45:30.166 --> 45:32.709
It's not difficult, I tell you. How do we know

45:32.917 --> 45:36.375
that we are not self hypnotized or you are not under some hypnosis.

45:36.583 --> 45:38.375
It's very simple to know. I don't know why

45:38.583 --> 45:40.250
the psychologist have not told you about it.

45:40.458 --> 45:42.333
They tell you all nonsensical things, why don't you tell

45:42.542 --> 45:44.333
this is a simple thing you want to know.

45:44.542 --> 45:47.333
What happens when you are hypnotized?

45:47.667 --> 45:51.417
What happens that you do things

45:51.625 --> 45:55.999
without being understanding about.

45:57.083 --> 46:00.166
But Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

46:00.999 --> 46:04.166
Not only that I know but once you get your Realization...

46:04.375 --> 46:08.125
[Now here] there's a doctor sitting here. He is psychologist.

46:09.625 --> 46:11.333
He used to do many things because

46:11.542 --> 46:14.250
Jung has said it, Freud has said it,

46:14.458 --> 46:19.750
but in Sahaja Yoga you know what you have to do.

46:20.875 --> 46:23.125
You know what you are, what we are.

46:23.333 --> 46:26.625
For example, I have to give you Realization, you take it from Me.

46:26.834 --> 46:29.041
All right? So what I want to try to do?

46:29.250 --> 46:35.041
I try to raise your Kundalini. There's a force,

46:35.250 --> 46:40.625
There's a force, residual force within you which I try to raise.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.041
Now what happens that in your triangular bone

46:44.250 --> 46:46.625
which is called as sacrum

46:46.834 --> 46:48.250
you can see the pulsation.

46:48.458 --> 46:50.250
Others you may not see, you may not feel.

46:50.458 --> 46:52.959
If you are a very good

46:53.125 --> 46:55.792
simple person I should say, good means simple person,

46:55.999 --> 46:59.041
no complication physical, emotional or anything,

46:59.250 --> 47:02.166
it will just shoot out. You won't be able to see anything.

47:02.375 --> 47:04.500
It's like a very good landing, you see.

47:04.709 --> 47:08.917
But supposing there's a complication in your liver or in the stomach

47:09.083 --> 47:12.709
everyone of you can see the pulsation

47:12.917 --> 47:18.999
in the sacrum bone. Now see the name sacrum bone also comes

47:20.458 --> 47:22.125
means sacred.

47:22.625 --> 47:27.417
And I found out Greeks knew about it, they knew about it.

47:30.709 --> 47:33.166
Now you can see it with your own eyes.

47:33.375 --> 47:36.500
Then you put a stethoscope, all right?

47:36.709 --> 47:40.000
And you can feel the pulsation phases.

47:40.208 --> 47:44.041
Anybody can feel it. Then it opens out

47:45.041 --> 47:49.000
this fontanel bone area. You can feel the cool breeze coming out.

47:49.625 --> 47:54.041
You can feel also the cool breeze coming out of your hands.

47:57.542 --> 48:00.333
It is so clear cut

48:00.583 --> 48:04.959
that we have here three-four doctors now, means Sahaja Yogis.

48:06.625 --> 48:10.500
They also now use diagnosing through Sahaja Yoga.

48:10.709 --> 48:14.625
It's so clear-cut and you know what you are doing about.

48:14.999 --> 48:16.792
There's a gentleman who got Realization

48:16.999 --> 48:20.000
who was also little bit thinking "I hope I am not hypnotized".

48:20.208 --> 48:22.500
This way everybody thinks, everybody is frightened in this country,

48:22.709 --> 48:24.375
I don't know why.

48:24.583 --> 48:27.125
But he was quite frightened, I thought maybe these gurus

48:27.333 --> 48:30.834
had done some harm, maybe that. I don't want to say no.

48:31.125 --> 48:34.583
And he said, "Mother you said that you can have

48:34.792 --> 48:38.083
information about people who are aware". I said, "Yes, you can".

48:38.667 --> 48:40.999
"I want to know about my father". I said, "All right, put your hands

48:41.166 --> 48:43.959
and see where is the vibrations, what happens into you.

48:44.166 --> 48:47.792
And he felt a burning on this part.

48:47.999 --> 48:50.500
"Now these are the centers of your father".

48:50.709 --> 48:52.375
I said, "That means this center is catching

48:52.583 --> 48:55.750
so he's down with bronchitis, very simple type of bronchitis.

48:55.999 --> 48:59.125
His father was in Scotland, he telephoned to him

48:59.333 --> 49:02.625
and found out that he was

49:02.834 --> 49:07.583
down with bronchitis. But that's not enough.

49:07.875 --> 49:09.750
You know how to cure people.

49:09.959 --> 49:12.500
It's not just to touch somebody, no.

49:12.709 --> 49:16.166
And I would say the biggest example it will convince you people

49:16.375 --> 49:20.417
is of one president, Sanjiva Reddy.

49:20.625 --> 49:23.917
He was operated in

49:24.083 --> 49:27.875
America and the operation failed. He came to London when he was

49:28.041 --> 49:31.375
in a very bad state and they could not do anything about it.

49:31.583 --> 49:34.125
They were preparing for his last crisis and death.

49:34.375 --> 49:36.709
I just went to see him with My husband

49:36.917 --> 49:41.291
and the High Commissioner here just mentioned that

49:41.500 --> 49:44.999
My, I have another name as Mataji Nirmala Devi.

49:45.291 --> 49:47.542
His wife had heard about Me, she said, "Oh,

49:47.750 --> 49:49.792
if you are here, please save my husband".

49:49.999 --> 49:52.667
You won't believe, I just touched him for ten minutes only.

49:52.875 --> 49:54.709
I didn't know what I was doing, what he was suffering from,

49:54.917 --> 49:56.959
I knew what was the problem, what was the....

49:57.125 --> 50:00.250
They didn't tell Me anything. I knew.

50:01.458 --> 50:05.291
And he's cured. Even today he's the President of India.

50:07.250 --> 50:09.917
So there is no question of self hypnosis

50:10.083 --> 50:13.500
because in hypnosis you don't know what you are doing.

50:13.709 --> 50:17.542
Here I know everything what I am doing, not only, but you will also.

50:17.750 --> 50:19.917
It's no question of only My doing.

50:20.083 --> 50:22.999
Now, I'm not here in Cheltenham

50:23.166 --> 50:25.999
but if some Sahaja Yogi is here, can do it.

50:26.458 --> 50:29.250
We have somebody now from America

50:29.458 --> 50:33.333
and there was a boy who was

50:33.542 --> 50:38.500
patient of leukemia,

50:38.709 --> 50:41.959
and he was in India but he went to

50:42.125 --> 50:45.999
America in New York, he was there. And we had some people there.

50:46.500 --> 50:50.291
And the father came to Me, grandfather came to Me and his mother.

50:50.500 --> 50:52.709
They wanted the child to be saved

50:52.917 --> 50:54.625
I said, "All right, we'll try".

50:54.834 --> 50:58.375
I said, "I can't go [with you to] your village now. But you can go

50:58.583 --> 51:01.083
to Pune and telephone from here

51:01.291 --> 51:04.542
to Christine - who is here now, she's here -

51:04.750 --> 51:07.125
and tell her that such and such child is there

51:07.333 --> 51:10.125
who's only hardly, what was the age, I think sixteen or something.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.625
Sixteen.

51:11.834 --> 51:13.083
And the doctor said, declared that

51:13.291 --> 51:16.417
within one month he's going to die.

51:16.667 --> 51:19.834
I said, "You just go and work out Sahaja Yoga on him".

51:20.291 --> 51:23.500
He was completely cured, he came to see me in England,

51:23.709 --> 51:26.999
in London, he was there, and he is now in India, he's all right.

51:27.250 --> 51:30.041
Now this is only, curing is one part. It's just a byproduct.

51:30.250 --> 51:31.917
Because I'm just telling you, it's so gross

51:32.083 --> 51:33.792
that people understand it better.

51:33.999 --> 51:36.750
If the subtle thing is quite [all right], can be.

51:37.041 --> 51:39.917
We have many people who are here

51:40.083 --> 51:44.917
who were drug addicts, alcoholics, worst type.

51:45.417 --> 51:50.041
Within one day they gave it up, within one day.

51:51.999 --> 51:54.041
But I know what I'm doing

51:54.500 --> 51:57.291
and once you are a Sahaja Yogi you can do it also.

51:57.583 --> 52:00.208
They know each and everything.

52:00.709 --> 52:04.208
P: My understanding [is exactly] the same as You, by instinct.

52:04.417 --> 52:06.583
SM: - What's it? P: - The experience given by instinct

52:06.792 --> 52:10.250
and the experience determined what we did far.

52:10.458 --> 52:13.125
So until we can do, we cannot be in the truth.

52:13.333 --> 52:15.291
So much trying to be in the truth.

52:15.500 --> 52:19.166
SM: Yes, that's it. Unless and until you become a realized soul,

52:19.375 --> 52:22.792
you don't know the truth. That's a fact.

52:22.999 --> 52:26.208
You have to become a realized soul.

52:26.417 --> 52:28.166
Because just now, like a microscope,

52:28.375 --> 52:31.291
if you don't have you cannot see microscope [molecules]. All right?

52:31.500 --> 52:32.792
You have to have a microscope.

52:32.999 --> 52:35.417
In the same way you have to have the Spirit

52:35.625 --> 52:38.542
to know about God, to know about everything.

52:38.750 --> 52:40.709
Say for example,

52:40.917 --> 52:43.333
it's a myth for people, to believe it's God or not,

52:43.542 --> 52:45.792
to believe in God or not because makes no difference

52:45.999 --> 52:48.125
because it's a myth, in a way.

52:48.417 --> 52:53.208
But it's not. For Me it's the truth and for you also it will be.

52:53.583 --> 52:55.917
Because once you raise the Kundalini, what happens

52:56.083 --> 53:00.667
you start feeling these vibrations, which are from the absolute.

53:01.125 --> 53:04.250
Now you ask a questions about Christ,

53:04.458 --> 53:08.583
say a big problem they have about His immaculate birth.

53:09.333 --> 53:14.417
Was that immaculate? You just feel tremendous vibrations.

53:14.999 --> 53:18.375
You ask about, "Is there God?" Tremendous vibrations.

53:18.583 --> 53:23.000
But if you want to ask about some person who is a fake person,

53:23.291 --> 53:26.792
"Is he a realized soul?" You might get burning.

53:26.999 --> 53:30.875
Sometimes you even get little blisters and that.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.417
Your hands will speak.

53:33.625 --> 53:38.792
That means you hands are not yet speaking, they have to speak.

53:43.291 --> 53:45.750
Is very simple to make out if you are hypnotized or not.

53:45.959 --> 53:50.000
I've had people, say from

53:50.208 --> 53:53.417
this transcendental one.

53:53.792 --> 53:56.291
They became epileptic, they came to Me.

53:56.500 --> 54:00.583
I said, "Till you became epileptic why didn't you know?"

54:00.792 --> 54:02.333
What was happening to you?

54:02.542 --> 54:04.166
They said, "We didn't know what was happening,

54:04.375 --> 54:07.000
you see it was like going under the blanket.

54:07.333 --> 54:08.917
We didn't know where we were moving".

54:09.083 --> 54:13.500
All of them, they don't know anything about it.

54:16.041 --> 54:17.542
When I talk of knowledge

54:17.750 --> 54:21.041
I don't mean that you turn any center and you then just see a light.

54:21.250 --> 54:24.917
Or you get some sort of a pinprick or any springing's.

54:25.125 --> 54:28.667
That you can get it with alcohol also.

54:29.041 --> 54:32.542
Is the knowledge, again I say is the awareness, again,

54:32.750 --> 54:34.667
is the awareness.

54:34.875 --> 54:40.083
You become much more alert, much more knowledgeable

54:45.667 --> 54:47.709
The psychologists have kept all these things to themselves,

54:47.917 --> 54:51.125
that's the problem with them is. Very dangerous people.

54:51.583 --> 54:53.041
They should have told what hypnosis is

54:53.250 --> 54:56.875
but they themselves are hypnotized, I think.

54:58.333 --> 55:03.083
Today, we are really dealing with pathological and [unclear].

55:03.917 --> 55:06.458
Because hypnosis is very easy to [meet].

55:06.709 --> 55:10.083
Very easy to [meet] another person who is hypnotized.

55:10.999 --> 55:13.792
They say, "I'm in love and I am in love my wooer

55:13.999 --> 55:18.166
and I love my wooer". What is that?

55:21.083 --> 55:24.959
It's not that. [unclear].

55:27.750 --> 55:30.917
Very good question.

55:31.625 --> 55:35.083
Any other question please?

55:47.999 --> 55:50.667
All right, let's have it then. Fine.

55:50.875 --> 55:53.750
It's very simple.

55:55.999 --> 56:01.041
One thing is anti-hypnosis that you have to close your eyes.

56:02.834 --> 56:05.834
Once also I've seen one thing happened. You know people,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.875
that thing you are suspicious, that I understand.

56:09.250 --> 56:12.917
You see, you have to be suspicious, the way things happen these days

56:13.125 --> 56:17.750
[unclear] just now when I was....

56:17.959 --> 56:21.542
[a lady for instance] in the program

56:22.583 --> 56:23.999
because she told Me, "Mother...

56:24.166 --> 56:26.291
I said, "Why didn't you get your Realization for one year?

56:26.500 --> 56:29.999
What happened? What was the thing that was a...

56:30.417 --> 56:33.250
So she told Me a story, it was very interesting.

56:33.458 --> 56:35.875
She said, "Mother you asked us to close our eyes

56:36.041 --> 56:39.291
and I didn't close my eyes [unclear].

56:39.792 --> 56:42.750
And then what happened that some people must have come in,

56:42.959 --> 56:45.166
perhaps You said "All right, come along"

56:45.375 --> 56:48.041
because You wanted we to settle down and try to sit.

56:48.250 --> 56:50.625
So I thought that you are saying, "Open the door

56:50.834 --> 56:52.709
and the people will feel the cool breeze".

56:52.917 --> 56:56.542
That was her... Seeing My gesture she misunderstood.

56:56.999 --> 57:00.792
And that's how, you know, she started doubting Me. Just find it.

57:00.999 --> 57:03.709
Then she said, "I saw it many times. Used to do the same

57:03.917 --> 57:06.417
and people came and we were meditating, "You should sit down".

57:11.875 --> 57:17.792
One year, poor thing didn't get her Realization, can you imagine?

57:18.792 --> 57:21.625
And like that, you see, sometimes happens.

57:21.834 --> 57:24.583
There was another one who was angry with Me. She said that,

57:24.792 --> 57:27.000
"Mother, You had promised that you give me Realization,

57:27.208 --> 57:30.792
[when You'll be coming]. She was just like, you see, ordering Me,

57:30.999 --> 57:33.750
Why didn't You give me my Realization now?

57:33.999 --> 57:37.458
I said, "All right I did promise, all right. What did I say to you?"

57:37.834 --> 57:39.792
I told her she has to be kind to her husband

57:39.999 --> 57:42.875
- she's very unkind to him - to her own children.

57:43.041 --> 57:44.500
She's very self indulgent.

57:44.709 --> 57:47.041
I told her, "You can't be that selfish and get Realization.

57:47.250 --> 57:50.417
Please try. Open your hearth.

57:50.959 --> 57:53.083
But she became worse with that.

57:53.333 --> 57:55.709
She said, "No". I said, "I know what you for definite you are".

57:55.917 --> 57:59.583
You don't tell me lies. I know that." So, the next lady to her,

57:59.792 --> 58:01.959
she said, "Why not? You came in the morning,

58:02.125 --> 58:05.166
you telephoned against your children and your husband.

58:05.375 --> 58:08.625
You have been doing wrong things to them".

58:09.792 --> 58:14.000
You have to be kind to people to get God's kindness, isn't it?

58:14.208 --> 58:18.000
It's important. I'm talking of love of God.

58:18.208 --> 58:21.500
He loves you because you love others.

58:24.083 --> 58:26.625
Close your eyes please now.

58:31.999 --> 58:34.250
You can't see Me there, isn't it?

58:34.458 --> 58:36.250
Pamela? That's why it's

58:36.458 --> 58:40.333
That's why you see Jack in the box.

58:41.709 --> 58:45.375
All right, please close your eyes. Now, I have to say one thing.

58:45.583 --> 58:49.458
It's a very great thing that will happen to you.

58:49.999 --> 58:51.999
For this you are taken many births

58:52.166 --> 58:55.375
and this is what you have been asking for.

58:55.667 --> 58:58.917
But it's not a crucifixion.

58:59.166 --> 59:01.542
It's a very cheerful thing.

59:01.750 --> 59:05.709
So have a cheerful attitude towards it.

59:06.041 --> 59:09.917
Not frivolous or flippant but cheerful.

59:11.667 --> 59:15.792
Because we are seeking our joy.

59:16.999 --> 59:21.417
We have to love ourselves, we have to respect our glory.

59:22.333 --> 59:24.917
Many people have, most problem in the west is that

59:25.083 --> 59:26.792
they are guilty all the time.

59:26.999 --> 59:28.625
Morning till evening they are sitting down.

59:28.834 --> 59:34.542
I think they see to many films of

59:34.750 --> 59:38.083
people in the High Court or something that they always

59:38.291 --> 59:40.999
sit down and say "I'm guilty of this and this and that".

59:41.166 --> 59:44.125
So the first thing we have to say

59:44.333 --> 59:49.542
is to assert that "Mother, I'm not guilty".

59:49.750 --> 59:54.208
Please say thrice, "Mother I'm not guilty and I can cope with it".

59:55.917 --> 59:58.917
Put your hands like this. All right.

59:59.208 --> 01:00:03.834
There's nothing to feel guilty. You have not murdered anyone.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:08.542
I'm talking of God Almighty,

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:13.583
who is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love,

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:18.417
ocean of forgiveness. What guilt can you have?

01:00:18.917 --> 01:00:24.166
So please don't have any guilt. Just say very clearly

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:27.250
that Mother, "I have no guilt, I'm not guilty".

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:30.333
Just say that. Close your eyes, please.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:34.333
And open your eyes when I tell you, because when the Kundalini rises

01:00:34.542 --> 01:00:37.000
at the Agnya chakra there's a dilatation of the pupil.

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:40.875
If your eyes are not closed it may not rise.

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:43.417
it's just here again, other way round

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:46.999
of the process. In hypnosis they hypnotize through the eyes.

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:49.500
Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:53.583
The attention has go inside. You cannot force it.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:57.792
Something has to happen inside to attract your attention

01:00:57.999 --> 01:01:02.667
and that's how your attention is strong.

01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:09.375
By the awakening of the Kundalini you get your Realization

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:14.792
and the Spirit shines through your attention.

01:01:14.999 --> 01:01:20.083
Your attention becomes enlightened and effective.

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:40.000
Please keep your eyes shut.
