WEBVTT

16:40.059 --> 16:47.179
Today, we are doing a special type of puja

16:47.299 --> 16:55.099
which is performed in the glory of Ekadesha Rudra.

17:04.499 --> 17:13.259
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of the Spirit.

17:20.619 --> 17:28.899
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

17:36.379 --> 17:41.099
He forgives, because we are human beings, we commit mistakes,

17:41.219 --> 17:44.499
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

17:44.619 --> 17:53.339
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives us.

18:05.419 --> 18:09.899
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity,

18:10.379 --> 18:13.059
we do immoral things,

18:13.179 --> 18:19.101
we do thieving, and we do things

18:19.221 --> 18:23.380
that are against God, talk against Him.

18:31.619 --> 18:35.279
He also forgives our superficialities,

18:35.399 --> 18:41.060
jealousies, our lust, our anger.

18:50.699 --> 18:59.019
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies,

19:00.819 --> 19:08.419
vanities and also possessiveness.

19:19.099 --> 19:23.019
He forgives our egoistical behaviour

19:23.139 --> 19:28.379
and also our subordination to wrong things.

19:39.859 --> 19:45.810
But every action has a reaction, and when He forgives,

19:45.930 --> 19:52.499
He thinks that He has given you a big grace-mark,

19:53.019 --> 19:56.619
and that reaction builds up within Him

19:56.739 --> 20:08.579
as a wrath, against those who are forgiven,

20:08.699 --> 20:12.099
try to do greater mistakes.

20:31.339 --> 20:33.899
Specially, after realisation,

20:34.019 --> 20:37.899
because such a big blessing there is of the realisation,

20:38.019 --> 20:41.226
you’ve got the light and, in the light

20:41.346 --> 20:44.219
if you are holding onto a snake

20:44.339 --> 20:53.019
then His wrath goes up because he sees how stupid you have been.

21:03.979 --> 21:07.699
What I am saying is that after realisation, specially,

21:07.819 --> 21:10.219
He is much more sensitive

21:10.339 --> 21:12.739
that, people who are forgiven

21:12.859 --> 21:17.419
and have been given such a big thing like Self-realisation,

21:17.539 --> 21:22.459
still they do wrong things then he is much more wrathful.

21:34.579 --> 21:38.564
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts reducing

21:38.684 --> 21:42.001
and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

21:54.019 --> 21:58.779
But when He forgives and, as a result of that forgiveness

21:58.899 --> 22:01.139
you feel the gratitude,

22:11.059 --> 22:15.419
then His blessings start flowing towards you.

22:21.339 --> 22:25.699
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive others.

22:30.779 --> 22:34.915
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust,

22:35.035 --> 22:37.787
He pacifies your greed.

22:51.099 --> 22:55.779
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come on our being

22:55.899 --> 23:00.219
and we become really beautiful flowers,

23:14.299 --> 23:22.339
and we start shining in the sunshine of His blessings.

23:32.459 --> 23:37.859
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power

23:37.979 --> 23:43.099
to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

23:54.659 --> 24:01.619
He protects realised souls at every point, in every way.

24:06.659 --> 24:11.939
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi

24:12.059 --> 24:17.539
but they are all neutralised by His tremendous power of protection.

24:27.579 --> 24:33.299
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided into right path.

24:41.659 --> 24:46.619
All the beautiful blessings of His are described in the Psalm 23

24:46.739 --> 24:49.739
isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

24:51.819 --> 24:53.459
The Lord is my Shepherd”

24:53.579 --> 24:58.419
Is all described how he looks after you like a shepherd.

25:12.339 --> 25:16.539
But He does not look after the evil people

25:20.819 --> 25:22.339
He destroys them.

25:23.979 --> 25:26.579
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are

25:26.699 --> 25:31.099
still carrying on with their evil nature are destroyed.

25:38.459 --> 25:41.459
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate

25:41.579 --> 25:44.499
and do not rise He destroys,

25:50.059 --> 25:52.459
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

25:54.899 --> 25:59.659
Those who murmur against God and live in a way

25:59.779 --> 26:06.379
that is not behoving a sahaja yogi, He removes them from [it].

26:13.379 --> 26:18.499
So by one force, He protects, by another force, He throws away.

26:26.819 --> 26:30.139
But His destructive forces when they are built up too much,

26:30.259 --> 26:36.739
then we call it : "Now the Ekadesha Rudra is active."

26:46.739 --> 26:49.899
Now, this Ekadesha Rudra will be expressed

26:50.019 --> 26:52.659
when the Kalki itself will start acting,

26:52.779 --> 26:57.099
means the destructive power which will destroy all

26:57.219 --> 27:02.819
that is negative on this earth and save all that is positive.

27:18.579 --> 27:21.579
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis

27:21.699 --> 27:24.659
to expedite their ascent,

27:24.779 --> 27:31.179
not to be satisfied with the social life or married life

27:31.299 --> 27:36.059
or with all the blessings that God has bestowed upon you.

27:54.659 --> 27:57.499
We always see, what God has done for us,

27:57.619 --> 27:59.859
how He has been miraculous to us,

27:59.979 --> 28:03.539
but we have to see what we have done to ourselves,

28:03.659 --> 28:07.739
what are we doing about our own ascent and growth.

28:23.259 --> 28:29.539
Now the…out of the eleven centres…… Ekadesha, means eleven,

28:29.659 --> 28:38.579
the five come from the right side of your void,

28:38.699 --> 28:42.019
and five from the left side of your void.

28:55.499 --> 28:59.979
The first five on the left hand side come from:

29:00.099 --> 29:04.699
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus,

29:14.499 --> 29:17.739
or if you have read wrong books,

29:20.659 --> 29:25.619
or if you have been in the company of wrong people,

29:28.699 --> 29:31.899
or if you have been sympathetic towards people

29:32.019 --> 29:35.059
who have been following wrong paths,

29:41.699 --> 29:46.499
or you have been yourself one of the agents

29:46.619 --> 29:50.899
or guru of these wrong people.

29:58.459 --> 30:10.059
Now these five problems can be solved, if we completely give up

30:10.179 --> 30:13.899
whatever wrong we have been doing.

30:25.299 --> 30:29.299
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to beat the Shaitan,

30:29.419 --> 30:32.859
-means the Satan- with shoes;

30:32.979 --> 30:38.899
but that has to be done not mechanically but from your heart.

30:50.099 --> 30:53.579
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will tell me,

30:53.699 --> 30:58.019
“My father is following this guru; that father is following that guru,”

30:58.139 --> 31:02.779
and get involved with their father, sister, this, that

31:02.899 --> 31:09.899
and try to take them out from those gurus, also get entangled.

31:24.219 --> 31:31.699
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

31:31.819 --> 31:36.499
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

31:36.619 --> 31:39.579
and her parents and parents-in-law said

31:39.699 --> 31:42.507
said must be baptised, and I told her

31:42.627 --> 31:46.579
you cannot get this child baptised because it’s a realised soul.

31:55.779 --> 31:59.979
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,

32:00.099 --> 32:02.339
and she took the child for baptism

32:02.459 --> 32:08.579
and the child became very funny – it was really like a mad child.

32:28.259 --> 32:34.339
Now then she gave up all that and so she has saved.

32:34.459 --> 32:37.059
But supposing she had another child

32:37.179 --> 32:40.099
and she would have done the same thing, the second child

32:40.219 --> 32:43.459
would have been something very, very bad.

33:01.379 --> 33:04.059
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is that

33:04.179 --> 33:06.459
anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme

33:06.579 --> 33:10.059
thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

33:19.059 --> 33:22.859
Either you should have very strong sensitivity,

33:22.979 --> 33:25.459
or you should feel it in your body,

33:25.579 --> 33:30.139
or with your intelligence you should understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

33:42.899 --> 33:46.169
A person who is still negative always gets attracted

33:46.289 --> 33:50.409
towards other one who is a very, very powerfully negative

33:58.899 --> 34:00.379
and does not understand

34:00.499 --> 34:03.819
that the other person is so powerfully negative,

34:03.939 --> 34:06.299
but gets impressed.

34:14.619 --> 34:18.579
Under such circumstances, such a person is hit

34:18.699 --> 34:20.579
by that negative person

34:20.699 --> 34:23.939
and Shiva cannot protect.

34:36.099 --> 34:40.379
One should not have sympathy with anyone who is negative,

34:40.499 --> 34:41.899
whether he is mad,

34:42.019 --> 34:45.699
whether there is something wrong with him, whether he is your relation,

34:45.819 --> 34:50.779
or anything. No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a kind

34:50.899 --> 34:54.059
of a anger should be there for that person,

34:54.179 --> 34:58.739
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

35:20.099 --> 35:23.019
And this angry detachment is the only time

35:23.139 --> 35:26.219
when you have to be angry.

35:35.499 --> 35:41.739
But I have seen people who have anger for very good sahaja yogis

35:41.859 --> 35:47.419
but not for their own husbands or wives who are extremely negative.

36:02.019 --> 36:10.019
So when the Ekadesha Rudra starts acting on these five sides

36:10.139 --> 36:12.859
on the, we should say, on the right side it moves, because

36:12.979 --> 36:15.739
it comes from the left and moves to the right side,

36:15.859 --> 36:27.339
then a person starts becoming negative but acting with his ego.

36:41.859 --> 36:46.299
Such a person may take up a situation into hands and say that

36:46.419 --> 36:50.859
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am so, we should do like this

36:50.979 --> 36:54.699
and we should behave like this”, and start dictating people.

36:54.819 --> 36:56.419
[They] can do anything.

37:14.099 --> 37:17.899
And some mediocres or some half baked sahaja yogis

37:18.019 --> 37:19.699
may try to understand [him],

37:19.819 --> 37:22.779
but most will know that “This fellow is going out,

37:22.899 --> 37:25.379
now he’s on his way out!”

37:41.219 --> 37:47.499
So, all these things lead to this left side development,

37:47.619 --> 37:53.459
or we can call it on the head, on the right hand side of your medha,

37:53.579 --> 37:55.419
this plate, brain-plate

37:55.539 --> 37:59.139
is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

38:11.819 --> 38:17.979
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea people have that,

38:18.099 --> 38:21.459
“I am myself a big guru.”

38:30.179 --> 38:34.499
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also, as if

38:34.619 --> 38:37.379
they have become great gurus.

38:46.099 --> 38:49.099
We have known some people who give big lectures

38:49.219 --> 38:54.339
in any programme and never allow my tape to be played or anything.

38:54.459 --> 38:57.939
They think they have now become experts.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.899
Then some of them say that now we have become so great

39:12.019 --> 39:15.979
that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

39:16.099 --> 39:19.859
there’s no need to do meditation – there are some like that also.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.539
And then there are some who say that

39:32.659 --> 39:34.979
"sin can never touch us, now we are sahaja yogis,

39:35.099 --> 39:38.419
we are very great evolved souls".

39:47.619 --> 39:51.259
But the worst of all are those who just take my name

39:51.379 --> 39:52.979
saying that “Mother has said so

39:53.099 --> 39:55.459
and I am telling you because Mother has said”

39:55.579 --> 39:59.339
– when I have never said such a thing, is all falsehood.

40:09.659 --> 40:13.259
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga money

40:13.379 --> 40:16.379
and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way,

40:16.499 --> 40:20.339
exploit them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

40:37.379 --> 40:41.459
And such people become very inauspicious.

40:45.059 --> 40:48.699
Anyone who tries such things

40:48.819 --> 40:50.899
will go out of Sahaja Yoga with disgrace.

40:59.739 --> 41:03.419
But one should never go near such a person,

41:03.539 --> 41:07.299
have nothing to do with such a person, have no sympathies.

41:15.579 --> 41:20.579
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone to any extent,

41:20.699 --> 41:23.379
so better keep out of such people.

41:33.139 --> 41:38.499
When these ten Ekadeshas are developed within a person,

41:38.619 --> 41:43.779
then definitely such a person gets diseases like cancer

41:43.899 --> 41:45.819
and incurable horrible diseases.

42:04.139 --> 42:09.099
Specially, when the eleventh one which is actually here,

42:09.219 --> 42:11.899
which is the Viratas chakra,

42:12.019 --> 42:15.619
which is the collectivity, when it is affected as well,

42:15.739 --> 42:19.619
then such a person cannot get out of this disease.

42:37.459 --> 42:41.699
But these…out of these even five are combined,

42:41.819 --> 42:48.099
supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

42:48.219 --> 42:54.019
then they get into very serious type of dirty diseases.

43:06.579 --> 43:12.539
That’s why, I always say that be careful about your Agnya chakra,

43:18.299 --> 43:21.699
because that is one of the worst things,

43:21.819 --> 43:27.539
that, once it starts getting combined with these Ekadeshas,

43:27.659 --> 43:31.539
part of the Ekadeshas, then anything can happen to a person,

43:31.659 --> 43:33.899
he can meet with a horrible accident,

43:34.019 --> 43:39.419
he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be murdered by someone,

43:39.539 --> 43:43.779
anything can happen to such a person who has got the right Agnya

43:43.899 --> 43:48.979
and also any one of the Ekadeshas, right or left.

44:09.739 --> 44:16.459
That means, the five of these, if they, any one of the five,

44:16.579 --> 44:18.499
if they combine with Agnya Chakra,

44:18.619 --> 44:22.339
the protective powers of God are minimum.

44:33.099 --> 44:36.179
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright,

44:36.299 --> 44:40.259
say now I am speaking, now you should watch Me constantly,

44:40.379 --> 44:42.539
so that there is thoughtless awareness

44:42.659 --> 44:45.899
and the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

44:56.339 --> 44:59.899
But, don’t pay attention here and there all the time.

45:04.779 --> 45:09.419
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention will neutralise

45:09.539 --> 45:11.539
into thoughtless awareness,

45:20.179 --> 45:29.459
and your attention would be fixed in such a manner

45:29.579 --> 45:34.179
that you don’t have to worry about anything.

45:43.539 --> 45:48.379
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch you, that is your fortress.

45:54.179 --> 45:57.779
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless awareness,

45:57.899 --> 46:02.099
that is the sign that you are rising higher.

46:10.339 --> 46:14.499
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright, Mother we are doing.”

46:14.619 --> 46:16.819
Mechanically, they do and say,

46:16.939 --> 46:19.699
“Yes, I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

46:19.819 --> 46:24.899
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness, minimum of minimum?

46:36.899 --> 46:40.539
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out of your head?

46:44.419 --> 46:46.899
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically,

46:47.019 --> 46:51.539
it is not going to help; help you or help anyone.

47:00.499 --> 47:04.459
So, after realisation, as you are very well protected,

47:04.579 --> 47:07.539
you have all the blessings and a great future,

47:07.659 --> 47:13.781
you also have a great

47:13.901 --> 47:21.341
possibility of a complete annihilation.

47:38.899 --> 47:43.419
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing,

47:43.539 --> 47:47.539
and everybody is supporting you to climb, holding your hand,

47:47.659 --> 47:51.219
and there are so many things by which you are protected,

47:51.339 --> 47:53.419
to be taken upward,

47:53.539 --> 47:57.779
there’s no possibility of falling off by mistake also,

47:57.899 --> 48:04.499
but if you try to remove your bondages with Truth and Love

48:04.619 --> 48:09.059
and all the time try to hit the people who are trying to support you,

48:09.179 --> 48:16.019
then you fall from a great height, greater height.

48:45.099 --> 48:48.579
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater you fall,

48:56.179 --> 48:59.979
and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

49:04.539 --> 49:07.979
But every effort is made by the Divine,

49:08.099 --> 49:13.539
every support is given to you, every care is taken.

49:13.659 --> 49:16.539
Despite that, if you want to fall,

49:16.659 --> 49:20.739
then from that height, is very dangerous.

49:35.499 --> 49:39.739
But Ekadesha Rudra, at that time, at such a time when somebody tries

49:39.859 --> 49:43.779
to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga, after being in Sahaja Yoga,

49:43.899 --> 49:52.219
then hits you so badly that the whole attack is very widespread.

50:09.179 --> 50:13.939
But the whole family can be protected if there are few people

50:14.059 --> 50:18.139
of that family doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

50:18.259 --> 50:22.339
But in case the family that is

50:22.459 --> 50:27.459
against all the time of sahaja yogis and try to trouble them,

50:27.579 --> 50:31.139
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad way.

50:54.459 --> 50:59.939
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of, as I told you, from the Void.

51:06.899 --> 51:11.339
So, we can say that the destruction part of it

51:11.459 --> 51:13.699
comes from the Void mainly.

51:20.059 --> 51:24.619
But these are the powers, all are given in one person

51:24.739 --> 51:30.019
that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus Christ.

51:40.259 --> 51:43.819
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

51:47.219 --> 51:49.539
He’s the personification of Omkara,

51:49.659 --> 51:51.939
he’s the Personification of vibrations.

51:52.059 --> 52:01.899
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe starts breaking.

52:18.299 --> 52:22.019
As He personifies the power of the Mother

52:22.139 --> 52:26.219
which is penetrating into every atom, into every molecule,

52:26.339 --> 52:28.259
and to every human being,

52:28.379 --> 52:31.819
into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

52:31.939 --> 52:37.459
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets into a jeopardy.

53:04.659 --> 53:10.899
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

53:15.299 --> 53:19.779
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like small children”

53:19.899 --> 53:22.899
That is, the innocence, the purity of the heart

53:23.019 --> 53:26.299
is the best way you can please Him.

53:37.379 --> 53:39.899
As in the West, specially, people

53:40.019 --> 53:42.739
have developed their brains too much,

53:42.859 --> 53:49.019
they try to play about with words

53:49.139 --> 53:53.819
and think that nobody knows what they are doing.

54:08.819 --> 54:18.819
All such people must know that everything you do is known to God.

54:23.139 --> 54:25.499
If you are not clean in heart,

54:25.619 --> 54:35.059
it is very dangerous for anybody to pose

54:35.179 --> 54:39.499
as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

54:52.699 --> 54:57.299
Such people are not possessed, nor they are conditioned,

54:57.419 --> 55:03.219
nor they are egoistical, but they are very cunning clever people

55:03.339 --> 55:06.819
and they are quite aware, as to what they are doing.

55:21.859 --> 55:24.859
But, there are people who get possessed also

55:24.979 --> 55:29.219
and then they, in that , they try to destroy themselves

55:29.339 --> 55:32.659
or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

55:41.299 --> 55:45.059
There are some who think that if they hurt themselves

55:45.179 --> 55:47.379
or do some sort of an extreme thing

55:47.499 --> 55:51.299
then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

56:08.459 --> 56:10.579
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

56:10.699 --> 56:13.219
then you should know that something is wrong with you.

56:21.099 --> 56:24.459
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga, then you must know

56:24.579 --> 56:27.139
that there’s something definitely wrong with you.

56:33.419 --> 56:36.339
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja yogis,

56:36.459 --> 56:39.499
then be sure something is wrong with you.

56:45.619 --> 56:51.979
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness of God,

56:52.099 --> 56:54.819
then something wrong with you.

57:02.099 --> 57:05.779
If you are still worried about negative people and their problems

57:05.899 --> 57:09.179
then know that there’s something wrong with you.

57:19.739 --> 57:22.139
If you have sympathies with negative people,

57:22.259 --> 57:25.139
then also there’s something wrong with you.

57:30.259 --> 57:34.859
But if you have anger for negative and all that is negative

57:34.979 --> 57:41.819
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are there.

57:54.739 --> 57:58.139
When this thing gets matured then you become the power

57:58.259 --> 58:00.939
of Ekadesha Rudra yourself.

58:08.779 --> 58:11.939
Anybody who will try to insult you

58:12.059 --> 58:14.859
or to do any harm, will collapse.

58:25.099 --> 58:29.139
It has happened with many people who tried to be insulting to Me

58:29.259 --> 58:31.099
or tried to harm Me or anyway….

58:31.219 --> 58:33.939
Sometimes I am quite worried about them.

58:51.939 --> 59:00.299
So one has to be in such a way that they become the Ekadesha.

59:08.299 --> 59:11.099
Nobody can touch such people.

59:13.619 --> 59:19.059
But such a person is full of compassion and forgiveness.

59:23.787 --> 59:28.987
As a result, Ekadesha acts much faster.

59:34.179 --> 59:39.219
The more compassionate you are the more powerful Ekadesha becomes.

59:47.219 --> 59:52.779
The more collective you become, the more Ekadesha acts.

59:56.899 --> 01:00:02.379
Many people have a habit of receding back into their exclusion

01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:06.987
and saying “Oh we better be at home and it’s alright,”

01:00:07.107 --> 01:00:10.027
but they don’t know what they are missing.

01:00:20.739 --> 01:00:23.419
Whatever may be your experience with others,

01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:25.459
you should stick-on together,

01:00:25.579 --> 01:00:30.941
always attend programmes, take leadership, go ahead with it,

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:35.501
work it out and you will be blessed thousand-fold.

01:00:47.499 --> 01:00:50.539
Ekadesha Rudra are all the powers,

01:00:50.659 --> 01:00:54.339
I would say, of destruction, together.

01:01:05.539 --> 01:01:08.899
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

01:01:11.819 --> 01:01:18.019
It is destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:25.299
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

01:01:28.139 --> 01:01:34.659
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…

01:01:40.226 --> 01:01:51.546
and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana, Kartikeya and Ganesha.

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:11.859
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

01:02:11.979 --> 01:02:18.699
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations are Ekadeshas.

01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:34.739
Now the last but not the least,

01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:37.739
is the destructive power of Hiranyagarbha

01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:40.619
which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

01:02:56.499 --> 01:03:01.339
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes,

01:03:01.459 --> 01:03:07.819
the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive power.

01:03:18.138 --> 01:03:22.321
So, thus, the complete total destructive power is Ekadesha Rudra.

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:35.459
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but it’s not blind.

01:03:40.459 --> 01:03:46.139
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately woven.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:57.099
It avoids all the good points and attacks the wrong things

01:04:09.059 --> 01:04:15.147
and it hits at the right time, at the right point,

01:04:15.267 --> 01:04:22.267
direct, without hitting anything that is good in between.

01:04:31.539 --> 01:04:35.419
Now the glance of Ekadesha Rudra falls upon someone,

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:40.339
say, for example, and there is something in between which is divine

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:44.619
or which is a positive thing

01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:48.946
[then] it penetrates through positive, without harming the positive

01:04:49.066 --> 01:04:51.266
and hits the negative.

01:05:06.499 --> 01:05:11.104
It cools down somebody and burns another.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:29.306
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools down.

01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:40.718
So that is how it works with such care and such delicacy.

01:05:46.897 --> 01:05:50.285
And it is tremendously sharp also.

01:05:52.874 --> 01:05:55.057
And it’s very painful.

01:05:57.007 --> 01:06:00.222
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot,

01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:04.509
it goes on slowly, slowly. All the horrible tortures

01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:07.421
that you have learnt or heard about

01:06:07.541 --> 01:06:12.102
are expressions of Ekadesha only.

01:06:30.865 --> 01:06:34.689
For example, take the case of cancer.

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:42.091
In the cancer thing, the nose is removed,

01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:45.583
the tongues are removed, then the gullet is removed,

01:06:45.703 --> 01:06:49.027
then everything goes on, one after, one after,

01:06:49.147 --> 01:06:52.779
being removed with terrible pain, you see.

01:07:05.205 --> 01:07:09.759
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot feel their fingers,

01:07:09.879 --> 01:07:13.735
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything eats their fingers

01:07:13.855 --> 01:07:17.415
they can’t feel it, so they start losing their fingers,

01:07:26.872 --> 01:07:33.167
that is how Ekadesha eats up people, devours.

01:07:39.486 --> 01:07:43.003
But this wrathfulness of the Father

01:07:43.123 --> 01:07:48.779
can be very gentle and could be very sweet,

01:07:53.088 --> 01:07:56.714
when it comes to His own children.

01:08:02.804 --> 01:08:07.561
The story is about the Mother

01:08:07.681 --> 01:08:10.905
– once She got very angry, the Primordial Mother.

01:08:11.025 --> 01:08:14.296
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy the whole world

01:08:14.416 --> 01:08:17.144
with Her Ekadesha power and She tried to destroy the whole world.

01:08:18.567 --> 01:08:23.401
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself felt

01:08:23.521 --> 01:08:28.814
that She is being [a] bit too much angry.

01:08:51.584 --> 01:08:57.049
So when She started destroying, and She was going right and left,

01:08:57.169 --> 01:09:01.606
He did not know what to do, so He took Her child,

01:09:01.726 --> 01:09:07.116
that means representing sahaja yogi, you can say, representing Christ

01:09:07.236 --> 01:09:11.656
or representing anyone of these great children of Her’s,

01:09:11.776 --> 01:09:15.488
that he put the child under Her feet.

01:09:50.748 --> 01:09:54.624
So, when She was stamping, suddenly She saw Her own child

01:09:54.744 --> 01:09:57.343
under Her feet  and Her such a big tongue came out.

01:09:57.463 --> 01:10:02.303
She just stopped. Balancing.

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:20.411
But this has happened only once.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.705
So, after the Ekadesha Rudra, ultimately

01:10:27.825 --> 01:10:35.165
the complete destruction comes through the anger of Sadashiva.

01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:52.261
When the final total destruction takes place.

01:10:57.467 --> 01:11:01.832
So thus we have seen how Ekadesha Rudra acts

01:11:01.952 --> 01:11:08.010
and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves Ekadesha Rudra.

01:11:17.308 --> 01:11:19.578
Now to develop this power

01:11:19.698 --> 01:11:29.958
one has to develop a tremendous power of

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:37.508
detachment, power of detachment,

01:11:45.312 --> 01:11:47.747
detachment from negative.

01:11:50.516 --> 01:11:54.047
For example, negativity can come from very near people,

01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:57.939
like brother, mother, sister, could come from friends,

01:11:58.059 --> 01:12:00.289
could come from relatives.

01:12:10.062 --> 01:12:14.339
It could come from a country, it could come from

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:18.149
your political ideas, economic ideas, anything like that.

01:12:18.269 --> 01:12:25.279
Any misidentification can destroy your power of Ekadesha Rudra.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:44.789
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I am surrendered

01:12:44.909 --> 01:12:47.458
to Sahaja Yoga and I am a sahaja yogi,”

01:12:47.578 --> 01:12:51.646
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:04.364 --> 01:13:09.062
So that, intelligently, you understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:13.986 --> 01:13:18.089
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent and if

01:13:18.209 --> 01:13:23.237
the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter into their intelligence

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:29.292
you can never overcome your attachments.

01:13:45.184 --> 01:13:48.671
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about Sahaja Yoga or

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.418
you give lectures on that, but mentally

01:13:51.538 --> 01:13:54.300
you should also understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:05.158 --> 01:14:08.992
Today is a special day when it has been asked that

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.911
we should have Ekadesha Rudra puja,

01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:21.352
and is for all kinds of false religious sects and false gurus

01:14:21.472 --> 01:14:28.155
and false religions, which are followed in the name of God,

01:14:47.853 --> 01:14:55.112
or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

01:14:55.232 --> 01:14:58.170
and does not achieve Self-realisation

01:14:58.290 --> 01:15:03.345
and does not get connected with God, is false.

01:15:18.925 --> 01:15:24.694
So any such thing that is just faith and talks of God

01:15:24.814 --> 01:15:26.873
but has no connection with God

01:15:26.993 --> 01:15:30.070
cannot be a true religion.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:46.551
Of course, it gives a balance to people,

01:15:46.671 --> 01:15:51.826
but in giving that balance, if people live on that money

01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:55.694
and try to enjoy

01:16:00.258 --> 01:16:02.926
a wealth out of that money,

01:16:03.046 --> 01:16:09.851
then it is not even at the very lower level is religion.

01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:14.216
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to give a balance to begin with,

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:17.521
but in that balancing when they tell, “You have to be balanced,

01:16:17.641 --> 01:16:21.023
but give me money for that, you must give me money,

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:24.045
give me all your purse, give me everything,”

01:16:24.165 --> 01:16:26.231
then that cannot be balanced,

01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:33.439
it does not even have a slightest thing of the blessings of God.

01:16:53.871 --> 01:16:56.697
Or any religion that makes you bow

01:16:56.817 --> 01:17:00.231
to anybody else but the incarnation, is no religion.

01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:04.076
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

01:17:15.852 --> 01:17:19.908
The real religion will give you a balance

01:17:20.028 --> 01:17:23.800
and will always talk about the ascent.

01:17:32.994 --> 01:17:36.511
But they will not ask for money or make one man

01:17:36.631 --> 01:17:40.617
something great as venerated.

01:17:50.892 --> 01:17:55.818
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between

01:17:55.938 --> 01:18:01.323
falsehood, negative things and real things.

01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:14.452
Once you develop that discrimination through vibratory awareness,

01:18:14.572 --> 01:18:21.925
or through your intelligence, you are in the control of yourself.

01:18:37.799 --> 01:18:43.101
And then you become that power of Ekadesha,

01:18:46.335 --> 01:18:50.366
when you establish your maturity.

01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:59.103
Today, I bless you all, that you all become

01:18:59.413 --> 01:19:03.361
the power of Ekadesha Rudra

01:19:03.481 --> 01:19:10.642
and you develop that sincerity which takes you to that state.

01:19:14.665 --> 01:19:16.945
May God Bless you.
