1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:11,650
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:18,769
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

3
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:27,200
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:35,390
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:44,670
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

6
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,829
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

7
00:00:49,829 --> 00:01:04,680
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:12,380
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

9
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,640
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:32,509
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

11
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:42,280
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

12
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:51,550
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:02:04,580
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

14
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:16,879
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

15
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:35,870
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

16
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:44,880
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,920
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

18
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,870
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

19
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,220
He was a very loving and a kind person.

20
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,660
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

21
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:09,780
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

22
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,959
You can’t help it.

39
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,306
What are they saying?

40
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:31,889
Who is it?

41
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:37,176
What happened?

42
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:43,457
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,815
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

44
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:13,083
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

45
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:14,374
What is it?

46
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:18,817
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

47
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:28,090
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

48
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:36,696
They are very good at fighting.

49
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:41,834
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

50
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:47,808
They have no understanding,

51
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,432
always ready to fight,

52
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:53,037
even with swords.

53
00:04:54,483 --> 00:05:00,899
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

54
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:06,474
This beautiful new building has been erected

55
00:05:06,897 --> 00:05:08,679
for our classical music.

56
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:11,361
They fought even on this

57
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:17,773
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

58
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:22,508
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

59
00:05:23,763 --> 00:05:27,302
They fight for some reason or the other.

60
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:31,150
They have no shame, nothing.

61
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:38,780
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

62
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,466
No maturity at all.

63
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:53,641
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

64
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:57,033
And the music has grown so much.

65
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:02,557
Everybody has the same experience.

66
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:07,005
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

67
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:11,466
and I am fed up with it.

68
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:15,771
Everybody is complaining about something.

69
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:19,636
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

70
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:24,314
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

71
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:28,933
and they have given so much knowledge.

72
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,777
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

73
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,642
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

74
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:41,462
They will fight even in their name,

75
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:45,640
keep behaving foolishly.

76
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:51,269
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

77
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,360
They just don’t understand peaceful living

78
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:04,317
and absorbing everything peacefully.

79
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:10,260
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

80
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:15,756
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

81
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,232
"Are they uneducated people?".

82
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:21,955
No, no, they are very well educated,

83
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,296
but very quarrelsome.

84
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:29,842
And why they fight, they only know.

85
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:37,325
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

86
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,383
and be a bit peaceful.

87
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,900
At least try.

88
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:48,161
We want to change, isn’t it?

89
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:52,954
Instead of finding faults with others,

90
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,195
see what is wrong with yourself.

91
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:03,506
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

92
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,213
at Nagpur.

93
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:11,203
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

94
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:17,832
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

95
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:22,345
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

96
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:31,113
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

97
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,798
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

98
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:37,608
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

99
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,607
When you think of just making money somehow,

100
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:44,076
run helter-skelter for it,

101
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:54,811
have such a low manner thinking,

102
00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,571
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

103
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,318
What should we call them?

104
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:10,088
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

105
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:11,903
We must achieve some good state”. 

106
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:15,706
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

107
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:20,116
So [all of you] decide today

108
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,175
to stop fighting from now onwards

109
00:09:25,784 --> 00:09:29,969
and stop being greedy for money,

110
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:32,782
which is too much in Maharashtra.

111
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:36,544
Here greed for money is amazing.

112
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:42,431
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

113
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:49,801
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

114
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:53,581
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

115
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:58,278
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

116
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:01,348
and live gracefully

117
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,460
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

118
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:09,127
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

119
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,661
You have not found a place to sit,

120
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:16,735
or you have not found a place to see…

121
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,503
Is this a political meeting or what?

122
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:28,890
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

123
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:33,551
when I saw you I had to say it.

124
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:39,239
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

125
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,311
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

126
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,932
There is no other way to correct this.

127
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,936
Everyone should live with affection.

128
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,727
If you cannot behave yourself,

129
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,433
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

130
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:02,562
It is our Baba special character

131
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:05,325
that he never got angry with anybody,

132
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:08,866
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

133
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:14,114
and never complained about anybody.

134
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:17,336
He would praise everybody.

135
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:20,580
I used to get misguided

136
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:24,684
how can everybody have such a good state.

137
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,293
I would never understand.

138
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:32,248
But Baba brought people together with love,

139
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:35,149
it may be just anybody.

140
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:39,767
He would never sit in My car,

141
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:45,028
never visit to My house.

142
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:49,535
He was very selfless and understanding.

143
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,884
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

144
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,044
but he was never so rude.

145
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,537
Till the end He was not rude.

146
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:03,301
Such a great personality he was.

147
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,300
You have joined this place,

148
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:09,961
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

149
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,810
Now, this,

150
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:30,795
we have built this temple for music

151
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:34,868
and other form of arts.

152
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:38,630
Your children must progress in these fields.

153
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:41,937
They must understand our classical music.

154
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:48,977
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

155
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:55,230
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

156
00:12:56,521 --> 00:12:59,013
then what’s the use?

157
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:02,905
You may not be a student of this place,

158
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:07,532
still, you must have knowledge about music.

159
00:13:07,876 --> 00:13:14,078
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

160
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:20,276
you cannot enjoy music.

161
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,943
I request you all

162
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:29,328
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

163
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:36,061
and develop goodness within you.

164
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,416
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

165
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:43,041
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

166
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:45,399
you cannot reap anything.

167
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,986
I sometimes feel that.

168
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:50,099
But now things are better

169
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,052
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

170
00:13:56,894 --> 00:14:01,365
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

171
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:05,301
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

172
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,006
understand the sahaja way,

173
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:12,190
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

174
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:15,116
If you don't learn this,

175
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,656
it is useless.

176
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:22,098
There are many music schools around.

177
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:24,743
Everywhere there are music schools.

178
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:28,893
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

179
00:14:29,094 --> 00:14:32,149
it is better not to learn music at all.

180
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:38,677
So I request you all, please,

181
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,886
that now with this music,

182
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:46,249
bring the music of your life

183
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,575
into your day-to-day practice.

184
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:53,792
Unless you follow this,

185
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,880
this program will not be accomplished.

186
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:08,337
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

187
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:12,302
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

188
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:16,112
The second problem here is about making money.

189
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:19,603
they are not leaving it at all.

190
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:22,952
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

191
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:25,563
They don't understand.

192
00:15:25,764 --> 00:15:29,708
How did people here get this greed?

193
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:33,262
It has spread so much

194
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:39,244
that I am fed up.

195
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,701
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

196
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:47,494
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

197
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,167
there should be rhythm in our lives.

198
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,691
Instead of being rhythmic,

199
00:15:53,892 --> 00:15:59,154
fighting all the time is not proper.

200
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:03,944
Thinking bad about others

201
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,332
and seeing only self interest

202
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,733
it's a wrong quality.

203
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,262
Now forget what happened in the past.

204
00:16:13,463 --> 00:16:15,750
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

205
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:18,370
who are understanding, loving,

206
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:23,042
and who will bring all people together.

207
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:31,452
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

208
00:16:31,653 --> 00:16:34,493
And the thing is,

209
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,551
now if we take to music,

210
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:41,630
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

211
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:43,958
What does it mean?

212
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,914
It means that the state of human beings,

213
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:55,066
is to be corrected

214
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:58,389
and has to be made rhythmic

215
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:01,312
and has to be made organized.

216
00:17:01,513 --> 00:17:03,162
Unless it is done,

217
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:04,818
it is of no use.

218
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,500
What is the difference between you people and others?

219
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:11,317
If you also keep fighting,

220
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,849
then what is the use?

221
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:18,806
The most important thing is that in your mind,

222
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:23,799
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

223
00:17:24,894 --> 00:17:27,986
so that you become peaceful

224
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:30,307
and others also become peaceful.

225
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,999
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

226
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:41,254
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

227
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:46,531
this beautiful building has been erected.

228
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:54,053
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

229
00:17:55,002 --> 00:18:00,307
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

230
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:03,810
Today world needs only Peace.

231
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,301
Everything else we have today is worthless.

232
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:10,668
We have to see how peaceful we are.

233
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:16,279
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

234
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,783
then on which country will it have?

235
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:25,451
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

236
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,160
But, I can’t see anything like it.

237
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:32,617
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

238
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,199
Don't know what to say?

239
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,778
So those who want to learn music,

240
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:43,132
must have music in their hearts also.

241
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:47,217
Should think from the heart.

242
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:51,447
Running after money, running after women,

243
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:54,753
and doing all sorts of wrong things

244
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:58,725
is unbecoming of a musician.

245
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:01,435
My eternal blessings

246
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:05,236
that this organization should flourish

247
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:10,338
and people coming here should learn music

248
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,467
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

249
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:19,206
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

250
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:24,415
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

251
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,948
whenever you have complains,

252
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:34,716
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

253
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,546
I am different from others,

254
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:42,197
Mother has transformed me into something else.

255
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,253
If you understand this

256
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:47,864
you will recognise your glory.

257
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:51,674
But if you cannot achieve this,

258
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,319
then it is useless.

259
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,136
Then making 50 such organizations

260
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:02,065
also is of no use.

261
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:06,798
Fighting for small, small things,

262
00:20:07,395 --> 00:20:09,557
doesn't become you.

263
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,692
You are Saints now.

264
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:16,466
You have achieved great heights,

265
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,902
very great heights,

266
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:21,938
And You do not realize that.

267
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:26,056
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

268
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,363
You think that you are

269
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,444
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

270
00:20:31,645 --> 00:20:33,019
No, no.

271
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,963
My special blessings

272
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,241
that you all should become musical.

273
00:20:41,601 --> 00:20:44,497
Today I wanted to bless you all,

274
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:50,028
that you become completely musical in temperament,

275
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,624
rhythmic

276
00:20:53,459 --> 00:21:01,054
and entertaining to others

277
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:03,847
and not quarrelsome.

278
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:08,127
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

279
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:11,238
is taking to wrong side,

280
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:13,541
to the wrong progress,

281
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:16,970
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

282
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,590
This will all disappear, I know,

283
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,717
because it is very destructive.

284
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:27,359
But, after coming to Sahaja also

285
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,862
if you have the same destructive idea,

286
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:32,961
how can anybody help you?

287
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:39,674
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

288
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:42,658
May God bless you.
