00:02.630 --> 00:15.829
[Music]

00:09.900 --> 00:15.829
[Applause]

00:16.460 --> 00:23.790
why all the religions have failed

00:19.550 --> 00:28.259
because they did not get their

00:23.790 --> 00:33.510
self-realization they did not become the

00:28.259 --> 00:36.719
spirit so there's a tremendous

00:33.510 --> 00:40.290
difference between you on earth and all

00:36.719 --> 00:43.500
others who profess somebody it looks as

00:40.290 --> 00:47.280
if they're hypocrites they

00:43.500 --> 00:50.999
intellectualize it as you know they

00:47.280 --> 00:54.210
explain it very well but you can see

00:50.999 --> 01:01.859
very clearly that they haven't absorbed

00:54.210 --> 01:07.520
spirituality that absorption was

01:01.859 --> 01:11.370
impossible without self like this

01:07.520 --> 01:15.060
everybody felt good I went to this limit

01:11.370 --> 01:20.700
and Mahavira both to say that forget

01:15.060 --> 01:25.890
about God forget about God Almighty you

01:20.700 --> 01:27.840
just get yourself yourself relation so

01:25.890 --> 01:31.920
they are called as atheist any rickshaw

01:27.840 --> 01:34.920
body they don't believe in Israel but

01:31.920 --> 01:38.759
they felt that the way people are just

01:34.920 --> 01:45.530
talking about God Almighty and what the

01:38.759 --> 01:49.350
books are said these books also speak of

01:45.530 --> 01:54.259
righteousness except in some books there

01:49.350 --> 01:58.229
has been some sort of interference but

01:54.259 --> 02:03.090
most of them speak of spirituality and

01:58.229 --> 02:07.340
what you have to achieve what is the

02:03.090 --> 02:07.340
purpose of religion

02:07.530 --> 02:15.060
everybody claims that they are the

02:09.819 --> 02:18.880
chosen ones but they are just the same

02:15.060 --> 02:22.660
there's a tremendous achievement of

02:18.880 --> 02:27.599
sahaja Yogi's that they have achieved a

02:22.660 --> 02:30.880
state of spirit so now you can absorb

02:27.599 --> 02:35.590
Dharma without any difficulties without

02:30.880 --> 02:37.989
any you will stick on to the truth first

02:35.590 --> 02:41.860
of all which is the most important thing

02:37.989 --> 02:49.630
that you have a rapport with God

02:41.860 --> 02:52.870
Almighty that you are in a way in awe

02:49.630 --> 02:56.830
about God all your attention will be

02:52.870 --> 03:00.310
towards the expansion of your awareness

02:56.830 --> 03:06.069
in the light of the Spirit this is the

03:00.310 --> 03:09.549
vision of your mother because she was

03:06.069 --> 03:12.250
just a witness so that Shiva is just

03:09.549 --> 03:16.540
witnessing all this plane he doesn't

03:12.250 --> 03:20.739
have any visions about but now you must

03:16.540 --> 03:23.049
have lots of hopes after seeing the kind

03:20.739 --> 03:27.480
of people that are created out of

03:23.049 --> 03:30.160
certain very unique very beautiful

03:27.480 --> 03:33.790
wonderful angel like people have been

03:30.160 --> 03:38.700
created now only problem is that you

03:33.790 --> 03:43.209
have to keep to your angelic foundations

03:38.700 --> 03:48.250
but I find that sometimes it happens

03:43.209 --> 03:56.319
doesn't matter that you fall and falter

03:48.250 --> 03:59.910
again you rise into your awareness and

03:56.319 --> 03:59.910
try to locate

04:03.400 --> 04:11.040
the new dimensions that are available to

04:08.200 --> 04:17.769
you that you can find out

04:11.040 --> 04:20.889
so this speciality that you have got is

04:17.769 --> 04:24.040
the region of all the saints of all the

04:20.889 --> 04:30.400
prophets of all this years of all the

04:24.040 --> 04:33.610
incarnations is you the heart has become

04:30.400 --> 04:36.610
so large because she was shining there

04:33.610 --> 04:39.610
is purity shining it has become such a

04:36.610 --> 04:41.770
large heart that it encompasses the

04:39.610 --> 04:44.470
whole universe I think the way people

04:41.770 --> 04:48.700
looking look at it that's why you all

04:44.470 --> 04:51.190
have become Universal people but that

04:48.700 --> 04:53.800
universe something you have got thanks

04:51.190 --> 04:57.450
to your spirit that was there quite

04:53.800 --> 05:00.000
intact and which has started shining

04:57.450 --> 05:03.580
sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject

05:00.000 --> 05:07.620
because you know everybody has failed to

05:03.580 --> 05:12.130
make people understand anything about

05:07.620 --> 05:17.200
impossible situation but this was the

05:12.130 --> 05:21.510
trick your spirit once your spirit is

05:17.200 --> 05:21.510
enlightened it goes into your head

05:22.020 --> 05:28.389
without any difficulties absolutely such

05:25.860 --> 05:36.389
you don't know how difficult is the

05:28.389 --> 05:36.389
subject of such it is such a fulfillment

05:38.879 --> 05:47.099
but the desire of the divine that your

05:43.199 --> 05:51.300
divinity is now expressive once you have

05:47.099 --> 05:53.639
got the spirit you get that power that

05:51.300 --> 05:56.729
you can surpass all the sin temptations

05:53.639 --> 05:59.069
not only temptations also the

05:56.729 --> 06:01.469
differentiations that you always make

05:59.069 --> 06:07.740
this is that this is that but you

06:01.469 --> 06:10.129
integrate integrate among yourselves you

06:07.740 --> 06:15.539
integrate among different states

06:10.129 --> 06:18.689
integrate among different countries the

06:15.539 --> 06:27.830
whole cosmos seems to be integrated

06:18.689 --> 06:27.830
woman and governed by the divine laws

06:28.279 --> 06:41.360
this integration gives you a complete

06:33.559 --> 06:44.360
understanding of sahaja yoga mentally

06:41.360 --> 06:44.360
emotionally

06:45.680 --> 06:48.970
as spiritually

06:51.020 --> 07:01.139
it's not by some sort of brainwashing or

06:57.169 --> 07:05.189
body but just through the light of

07:01.139 --> 07:08.550
spirit you have seen the truth and you

07:05.189 --> 07:12.509
have understood it also you have so many

07:08.550 --> 07:19.649
powers you do not want to exert that's a

07:12.509 --> 07:23.249
different point or thing but just on one

07:19.649 --> 07:26.279
word of Prayer from you it's very

07:23.249 --> 07:35.729
powerful than hundreds of prayers of

07:26.279 --> 07:39.860
these people one asking is much more

07:35.729 --> 07:44.159
powerful then thousands of these asking

07:39.860 --> 07:47.610
you have never tried that try that so

07:44.159 --> 07:52.110
very powerful in collective and also

07:47.610 --> 07:58.050
individually I don't desire it but you

07:52.110 --> 08:00.539
have to decide you have to pray you have

07:58.050 --> 08:03.869
to ask and the wider you become your

08:00.539 --> 08:07.439
prayers will be wider for a wider world

08:03.869 --> 08:09.959
wider region not limited to your

08:07.439 --> 08:16.039
children and not imitate your family not

08:09.959 --> 08:18.539
limited to one place but unlimited areas

08:16.039 --> 08:24.719
because if we have the power and if we

08:18.539 --> 08:28.919
can operate the divine power then why

08:24.719 --> 08:30.990
not we work it out ourselves we can so

08:28.919 --> 08:39.060
your attention can go to any place it

08:30.990 --> 08:41.370
can go to Nicaragua it can go to Israel

08:39.060 --> 08:43.860
it can go to Saddam Hussein to any place

08:41.370 --> 08:47.939
that you want to work it out it moves

08:43.860 --> 08:53.639
its mobile it's Universal just start

08:47.939 --> 08:56.000
expanding your heart your mind and your

08:53.639 --> 08:56.000
attention

08:56.770 --> 09:04.210
I bless you all from my heart really

09:00.970 --> 09:07.720
sights the Shiva the Sadashiva and

09:04.210 --> 09:11.170
Sadashiva bliss is he the one who is

09:07.720 --> 09:20.260
watching watching all of you with such

09:11.170 --> 09:23.950
admiration his joy knows no bounds it's

09:20.260 --> 09:29.110
tremendous as if he is Dancing with joy

09:23.950 --> 09:31.209
I hope all of you respect the principle

09:29.110 --> 09:36.660
of Shiva within you that's the most

09:31.209 --> 09:36.660
important and look after your vibrations

09:36.690 --> 09:44.980
which are Sates in your being because

09:41.610 --> 09:49.709
the spirit has awakened in your

09:44.980 --> 09:52.209
attention in your central nervous system

09:49.709 --> 09:59.350
that's the most important thing you have

09:52.209 --> 10:04.470
to do the rest of it is such the stuff

09:59.350 --> 10:04.470
it is absolutely such may God bless

10:05.720 --> 10:09.470
