00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:15.829
[Music]

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.829
[Applause]

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.790
why all the religions have failed

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:28.259
because they did not get their

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:33.510
self-realization they did not become the

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:36.719
spirit so there's a tremendous

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.290
difference between you on earth and all

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.500
others who profess somebody it looks as

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.280
if they're hypocrites they

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.999
intellectualize it as you know they

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.210
explain it very well but you can see

00:00:50.999 --> 00:01:01.859
very clearly that they haven't absorbed

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:07.520
spirituality that absorption was

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:11.370
impossible without self like this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.060
everybody felt good I went to this limit

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:20.700
and Mahavira both to say that forget

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:25.890
about God forget about God Almighty you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.840
just get yourself yourself relation so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.920
they are called as atheist any rickshaw

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.920
body they don't believe in Israel but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.759
they felt that the way people are just

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:45.530
talking about God Almighty and what the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:49.350
books are said these books also speak of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.259
righteousness except in some books there

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:58.229
has been some sort of interference but

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:03.090
most of them speak of spirituality and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.340
what you have to achieve what is the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.340
purpose of religion

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:15.060
everybody claims that they are the

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:18.880
chosen ones but they are just the same

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.660
there's a tremendous achievement of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.599
sahaja Yogi's that they have achieved a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.880
state of spirit so now you can absorb

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:35.590
Dharma without any difficulties without

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.989
any you will stick on to the truth first

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.860
of all which is the most important thing

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:49.630
that you have a rapport with God

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:52.870
Almighty that you are in a way in awe

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.830
about God all your attention will be

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.310
towards the expansion of your awareness

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.069
in the light of the Spirit this is the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.549
vision of your mother because she was

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.250
just a witness so that Shiva is just

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.540
witnessing all this plane he doesn't

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:20.739
have any visions about but now you must

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.049
have lots of hopes after seeing the kind

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.480
of people that are created out of

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.160
certain very unique very beautiful

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.790
wonderful angel like people have been

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.700
created now only problem is that you

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.209
have to keep to your angelic foundations

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.250
but I find that sometimes it happens

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:56.319
doesn't matter that you fall and falter

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:59.910
again you rise into your awareness and

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.910
try to locate

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.040
the new dimensions that are available to

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.769
you that you can find out

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:20.889
so this speciality that you have got is

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.040
the region of all the saints of all the

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:30.400
prophets of all this years of all the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.610
incarnations is you the heart has become

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.610
so large because she was shining there

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.610
is purity shining it has become such a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.770
large heart that it encompasses the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.470
whole universe I think the way people

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:48.700
looking look at it that's why you all

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.190
have become Universal people but that

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.800
universe something you have got thanks

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.450
to your spirit that was there quite

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.000
intact and which has started shining

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.580
sahaja Yoga is such a subtle subject

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.620
because you know everybody has failed to

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:12.130
make people understand anything about

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:17.200
impossible situation but this was the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:21.510
trick your spirit once your spirit is

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.510
enlightened it goes into your head

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.389
without any difficulties absolutely such

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:36.389
you don't know how difficult is the

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:36.389
subject of such it is such a fulfillment

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:47.099
but the desire of the divine that your

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:51.300
divinity is now expressive once you have

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:53.639
got the spirit you get that power that

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.729
you can surpass all the sin temptations

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.069
not only temptations also the

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.469
differentiations that you always make

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:07.740
this is that this is that but you

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:10.129
integrate integrate among yourselves you

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.539
integrate among different states

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:18.689
integrate among different countries the

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:27.830
whole cosmos seems to be integrated

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:27.830
woman and governed by the divine laws

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:41.360
this integration gives you a complete

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:44.360
understanding of sahaja yoga mentally

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.360
emotionally

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.970
as spiritually

00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:01.139
it's not by some sort of brainwashing or

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:05.189
body but just through the light of

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:08.550
spirit you have seen the truth and you

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:12.509
have understood it also you have so many

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:19.649
powers you do not want to exert that's a

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:23.249
different point or thing but just on one

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:26.279
word of Prayer from you it's very

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:35.729
powerful than hundreds of prayers of

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:39.860
these people one asking is much more

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:44.159
powerful then thousands of these asking

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:47.610
you have never tried that try that so

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:52.110
very powerful in collective and also

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:58.050
individually I don't desire it but you

00:07:52.110 --> 00:08:00.539
have to decide you have to pray you have

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.869
to ask and the wider you become your

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:07.439
prayers will be wider for a wider world

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:09.959
wider region not limited to your

00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:16.039
children and not imitate your family not

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:18.539
limited to one place but unlimited areas

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:24.719
because if we have the power and if we

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:28.919
can operate the divine power then why

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:30.990
not we work it out ourselves we can so

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:39.060
your attention can go to any place it

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:41.370
can go to Nicaragua it can go to Israel

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.860
it can go to Saddam Hussein to any place

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:47.939
that you want to work it out it moves

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:53.639

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:56.000

admiration his joy knows no bounds it's

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:29.110
tremendous as if he is Dancing with joy

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:31.209

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:36.660
of Shiva within you that's the most

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:36.660
important and look after your vibrations

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:44.980
which are Sates in your being because

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:49.709
the spirit has awakened in your

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:52.209
attention in your central nervous system

00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:59.350
