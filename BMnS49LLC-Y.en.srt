1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,080
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

2
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,760
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,680
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,760
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,000
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,280
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,160
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,920
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis I met.

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,560
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,400
with this honesty of seeking.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,040
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,720
or manifests outside in the gross as

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,720
another the right, and one in the center.

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,520
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,440
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi or Gaja Lakshmi

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,960
and in the center is the Lakshmi which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,480
When the seeking starts,

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,440
a human being first starts seeking food.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,800
Food is very important for all the animals.

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,880
If they have no food

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,440
then they cannot exist.

24
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,640
So the seeking starts with food,

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,560
and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,960
So this center is made of water

27
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:18,320
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

28
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:30,680
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

29
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,120
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,960
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

31
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,000
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

32
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,520
and not involved with any wrong things,

33
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

34
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,320
means their well-being is looked after.

35
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,480
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

36
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,440
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

37
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,560
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

38
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
has been helped miraculously

39
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,400
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

40
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,640
In so many ways they are helped,

41
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,120
that one has to just see for themselves

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,520
how these miracles take place.

43
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:38,720
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

44
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,560
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
When he came to Me, after some time I found

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,960
he would bring one garland,

47
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,640
big garland, for Me every evening.

48
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

49
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,840
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,680
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

51
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,560
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

52
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

53
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,160
I said, "Why, what happened?"

54
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,120
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

55
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,760
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

56
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,840
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

57
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,800
And after Realization I used to always go

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,240
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

59
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,680
piece of land that I had.

60
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,080
After some time when I was coming here after that,

61
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,720
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,080
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,320
I said, “What's the problem?” He said that

64
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:05,960
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

65
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,200
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

66
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,320
from this part of the land that you have,

67
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,480
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

68
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,480
that we would like to purchase this clay from you

69
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,200
at the price of seers."

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,520
And that's how he started getting money sufficient for him

71
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,960
and he became much better off.

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,320
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

73
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
in any principle.

74
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,640
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

75
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,360
You don't become extremely rich.

76
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,880
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

77
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,520
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

78
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,280
very big headache.

79
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,440
If they are sick, if you cure them of their heart trouble,

80
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,520
then they try to possess you.

81
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,960
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

82
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,800
all kinds of patients to you,

83
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,760
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

84
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,120
They immediately start talking about their cures

85
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,040
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

86
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,880
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

87
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,880
Without any appointment they'll arrive

88
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,840
and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

89
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,800
it's terrible.

90
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,080
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

91
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,960
and you have to show all patience,

92
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
all their friends, they become like agents.

93
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,720
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

94
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,360
they want to oblige them and spare

95
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,480
no love, no affection, nothing further.

96
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,280
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

97
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,240
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

98
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
they feel insulted.

99
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,920
And they all try curing much faster

100
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
than anybody else does.

101
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,680
They themselves are weak, they are sick people themselves,

102
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,800
heart patient, this patient, that,

103
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,400
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

104
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
If you don't tell them, they'll get sick

105
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,120
and you'll have another problem.

106
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,480
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

107
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:41,080
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

108
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
that they have accumulated with their money,

109
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,320
and they never know how they go on hurting

110
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,320
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

111
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,520
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

112
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,640
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

113
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,120
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

114
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,360
It's a very bad thing.

115
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,520
So too much of riches is also not okay

116
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,920
because it gives you a tremendous

117
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,680
ego that you don't see yourself,

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,440
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,720
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

120
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,680
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

121
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,600
according to their business ways which is impossible.

122
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
See, they have to gain money,

123
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,680
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

124
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,960
I don't have to earn money or anything.

125
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,320
If I am doing anything, I’m, really, in a way, I'm obliging. Isn't it?

126
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,760
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

127
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,480
without having their own discipline.

128
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,320
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

129
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,640
so far have been extremely troublesome,

130
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,120
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

131
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,640
They are very narrow-minded.

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,280
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

133
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,560
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

134
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,200
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,040
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

136
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,920
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

137
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,720
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

138
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,560
even, I would say, a bulldog.

139
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,040
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

140
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,160
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

141
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,360
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

142
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,840
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

143
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,600
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

144
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,680
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

145
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,640
Compassion is that works,

146
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
compassion is that flows,

147
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,200
compassion is that manifests.

148
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,960
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

149
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,320
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

150
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,160
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

151
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,960
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

152
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,600
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

153
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,280
They became horrid.

154
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,720
Some of them started drinking,

155
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
some of them took to some other ways and they became

156
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,880
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

157
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,960
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

158
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,400
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

159
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,840
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

160
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,440
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

161
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,080
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

162
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,360
Not Me, I'm sorry.

163
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,160
But only thing I feel sorry for them

164
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,400
that they cannot get to God.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,600
There is no honesty of seeking in them,

166
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,640
there is no honesty of seeking.

167
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,760
The elite people whom I have addressed

168
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,360
so many places like this, because

169
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,480
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

170
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,160
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

171
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

172
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,760
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

173
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,880
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

174
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,080
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

175
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,760
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

176
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,640
or some houses or something like that.

177
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,600
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

178
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,960
I have always seen from My father's side

179
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,120
and from My husband's side.

180
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,360
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

181
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,760
But human beings are such,

182
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,600
a empty vessel makes a big sound,

183
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,200
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

184
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,920
Not that the very poor are also good,

185
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,200
because those who are extremely poor

186
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,680
are busy with their food problems.

187
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,920
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

188
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,600
come up to a point.

189
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,240
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

190
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,840
Those who are extremely rich and proud

191
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,880
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

192
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,480
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

193
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,760
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

194
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,480
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

195
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,280
and then it can engulf.

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

197
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,360
I have tried both ways and I have told you what happened.

198
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,200
Whom I gave money,

199
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,880
whom I tried to help through giving money

200
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,680
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

201
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,560
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom

202
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,560
I thought were moneyed and satisfied people

203
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,920
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

204
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,720
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

205
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,280
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

206
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,760
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

207
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,600
but this kind of an ignorance still in their minds

208
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,680
is that they can possess God, they can possess everyone.

209
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,920
For such people there are no reasons

210
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,240
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

211
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,200
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

212
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,080
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

213
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,680
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

214
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,440
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

215
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,760
In this ascent of yours,

216
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,960
money is not important at all.

217
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

218
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,280
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

219
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,480
I would say, very poor people in the sense that

220
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,160
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

221
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,720
they are sometimes factory workers

222
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,480
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

223
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,800
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

224
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,960
They have such beautiful eyes

225
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,640
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

226
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,160
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

227
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,360
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

228
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,560
and lady who is a mother.

229
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,400
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

230
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,960
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

231
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,680
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

232
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,720
to give his money to the poor also.

233
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,280
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

234
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,760
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

235
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,440
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

236
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
The person who is a real seeker,

237
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,080
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

238
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,480
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

239
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

240
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,520
The problem that lies with human beings is

241
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,600
that they do not know what they want.

242
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,000
They think they want first of all money.

243
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,840
But those who have money,

244
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,480
they think they must have power.

245
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,760
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

246
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
because they have had no power.

247
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,480
Then they fail in politics,

248
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,720
or say they become too much in politics, whatever it is,

249
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,560
then they want love from their children which they can't get,

250
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,520
because they are too busy or something like that.

251
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,920
So they don't know what they want.

252
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

253
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,280
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

254
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,400
and they will tell you how things have gone wrong there,

255
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,920
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

256
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,760
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

257
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,320
You cannot call them human beings

258
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,760
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

259
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,640
and that society tolerates such people.

260
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,520
In India if you hear somebody killing a child,

261
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,880
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

262
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,120
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

263
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,560
nobody will ever look at that person.

264
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,680
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

265
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,720
give any girl in the marriage to

266
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,840
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

267
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,080
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

268
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,600
And then there are funny relationships also,

269
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,240
it's something so absurd,

270
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,840
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

271
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,800
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

272
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,640
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

273
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,840
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

274
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,880
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

275
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,800
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

276
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,240
You do not want to keep your relationship

277
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,960
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

278
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,600
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

279
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,680
and how can you say, “What's wrong? I do what I like.”

280
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,840
You just become like a malignant cell.

281
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,320
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

282
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,360
that one should not hanker after money too much.
